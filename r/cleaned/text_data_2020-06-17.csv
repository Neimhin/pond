BACK UK abandoning existing contact-tracing app switching technology provided Apple Google, Sky News news announced briefing later move marks major U-turn, government insisted centralised model effective model proposed technology particular government believed holding data contacts centralised manner would able develop valuable epidemiological data virus centralised model would also helped prevent people causing mischief system giving authorities edge detecting false positives.

What waste money... thought could develop something better crazy! would love this. father thinks masks nothing security blanket. became mandatory would love much would piss off. what's next church?  much changes,” Howard Gamble, administrator Wheeling-Ohio County Health Department, said. “The church anything special close."" That's government direction yet spike new cases. So??? I’ve considering buying condo moving cancer worried it’s risky. And? arrest physical attacking person refuses obey rules. military ressources make safer eliminate threat reasonable way it. harm purpose break resistance without long lasting effect her. Nothing bad opinion maybe explain point? Face shields PPE used different purpose don’t contain exhaled particles, would especially important plane. Also tradeoff removal relevant PPE sake seeing flight attendants smile shallow worth risk exposes people Oh know assume they'd rather empty unit unit taking wear tear potentially non-paying tenant. Seems bit exaggeration, dismiss concern 100%. Hahahahah brigadist xD make take off.  I’m sure, it’s definitely Muppet Christmas Carol version! watch every year! that's happened watch video.

So literally lying.  need disagree. don’t know read Washington post frequently. say it’s strongly propaganda incorrect. need? Faizal go back kindergarten roll flow Doesn’t matter. Constitution gives states right institute quarantines, lockdowns, etc. many people moving back ""home"" uncertainties caused pandemic? live Mississippi around 45% population black. overwhelming majority black people see wearing masks properly all. either wrapped around chin, exposing mouth nose nose exposed. 

I've asked say thing. ""They can't breathe"" properly. Like yeah, uncomfortable, they're putting people risk. 

There's nothing lack trust authorities. Shit trust authorities I'm mostly white. rural southern people trust cops either, they're wearing masks part. Errr, one ever said younger people get virus. normal? media reported direct quote, also notice filing.  


""... forced floor officer placed knee back neck, according notice claim provided ABC News expected filed Thursday morning. "" 


Rozier, 22, claims resisting, said ""pushed back head neck ground, arm pulled twisted, knee pressed back neck forcefully placed handcuffs"" least six police officers, notice claim read.  


According notice claim, Rozier's injuries ""to neck, back, left wrist, right wrist, left hip, left knee."" totally made stat though. counting gangland drive bys happened bus stops gang shootings happening school parking lots 2 summer. Bars restaurants mandate masks eating capacity limited. varies widely based area, overall age population, **how overwhelmed hospitals got (or not)**, amongst factors.

This one worries most.

Our healthcare workers absolute best little have, many people coming COVID-19 saved efforts. However, there's much handle. 


Once get overwhelmed, likely seeing spikes deaths people try ride thing home hospitals room. Yeah, !.. I'm well get morning (around 5am) eat breakfast 30 45 minute ""light workout"" (stretching, body-weight exercises 20lb dumb bell stuff).. also try walk bike lot get cardio little. 

If interested,. here's neat picture healing-progression Lungs. zoom 2 pictures Left, near top, still see Ventilator tube throat (because 2 pictures still ICU). pretty crazy ""cloudy"" infected Lungs were... far-right picture (6/15) shows massive improvement. I'm still 100%, much getting there. 

A neat side-diagnosis Lung Xray 6/15,. one ""Findings"" ""Atherosclerosis aortic arch"" (basically = hardening artery).. I'm getting checked now. May nothing unusual (I turn 47yrs old today, pretty common older people).. get handle cholesterol plaque now,. prevent old age heart attacks, etc. Honey, think solve pandemic voluntary choice.

I'm dense one. NY one states actually followed mask guidelines. I’d love adopt mask-accepting society people sniffles little cough wouldn’t mind putting one continue go work school. least try spread whatever system moment. Joe Rogan type pseudo-intellectual Ben Shapiro

I've always though Shapiro's thoughts own, though. Except found treatment save reasonable percentage people oxygen ventilators locking delaying spread, lives going saved. becoming apparent masking works save lives, unclear start pandemic, lives saved. Every delayed case possible saved life. know proper balance locking opening seems Sweden missed it. second stimulus check even thought anymore, ignoring fact tons people havent even gotten first Multiple factors

1) lot people already got it. Overall, NYC 22% antibody rate neighborhoods 40-50% range. That's herd immunity, drastically slow spread.

2) Lots testing. NYC (and NY general) testing higher per capita rate anywhere US. allows us catch cases isolate

3) Mask usage. live Westchester County I'm NYC time, live, Masks worn people. Almost every store requires mask well.

4) Mild summer. weather mild means people outside transmission way lower indoors.

5) big indoor venues open yet  Yep cautious over. canceled two appointments week LA. 

The protocol entering bad anyway wasn’t gonna go. heightened alert. 30 healthcare workers tested positive COVID-19 Miami VA hospital past week — largest outbreak facility since start pandemic — spokesman said Wednesday.
  largest reported outbreak among healthcare workers Florida hospital. staff workers Miami VA told Herald spooked spread.   
  first time ever notified outbreak,” said nurse works hospital. “Normally, hush-hush. that’s bad was. nurses really scared. “

Read here: given vote, since incapable jumping extremes since apparently equate wearing mask protect fellow humans potential death overbearing tyranny. disease anything racial injustice? need someone telling wash hands, bigger problems. wear masks religiously. (45f) father (67m) confronted people chastized/mocked wearing masks public. *Hyper Individualism*. Extreme selfishness touted moral good wrapped Gadsden flag. I'm sure religious person would consult Rabbi, alternative treatment exist I'd think would allowed, especially since know seems mild suddenly turn worst. Im saying approach issue country different tone Strain lighter BUTBUTBUT doesnt decrease FEAR sweden xD whats correct amount extra compensation possibly dying lungs/immune system screwed life ? Even worse, federal government would outbid states whose governors didn’t act deferential Trump. son caught daycare teacher (no anger there, best person ever, school teacher following protocols). Almost kids class got it. mostly asymptomatic. Maybe slight fever? Reduced appetite? Fatigue? can't honestly tell you. daughter (elementary aged) fever 3 days. Yesterday got 103, day yesterday perfectly fine even water balloon fight outside. ok morning, 100 temp. symptoms. 

The lack mask wearing dumb. People made Harris County Commissioner requiring masks - governor overruled that. stupid AF. 
Of note, teachers school wearing masks. kids. Obviously. english fine, especially second language. Keep practicing!  suppose feel bad women? Life full risks, took one going bar. chance getting probable. get it. 

At point, life move forward knowing Covid risk. like virus there. Getting sick Covid isn’t death sentence even though many sub like believe. 

Also, women prove already infected fault spreading it? covid sap oxygen?

If makes sense, brain need oxygen. kind non news like saying victims drowning suffer memory loss. Well yes course do, that's common sense. literally top comment. need downvotes.

Fr, people upvote brainless comments? Notes briefing (i watch real time, bit late rewatch it; posting first part now, might add questions journalist another post below)

* increased testing lot new confirmed cases. show graph separates confirmed cases mild serious symptoms - start May proportion start June (when mild cases started tested Västra Götaland regions) 4x mild cases serious ones increasing (the graph shows 7 day running mean).
* ICU admissions largest regions (that also increased testing) still falling. increased detected infections far translated another increase hospital care workload.

**Please, remember lag reporting deaths reported certain day usually mostly deaths happened previous days. average takes 11 days report 90% deaths certain day (see links graphs looks)**

Useful links:

Many landlords leveraged can't handle months without rent, suspect trying liquidate property (or go foreclosure) late year. make sure first never ends... scandinavia... sorry pick suddenly regard neighbours competition xD 

Where brave souls irl? XD Keep mind, governor started taking Coronavirus mitigation seriously March/April observed ""When see President demeanor last couple days, that's necessarily always is."" Forget medical professionals telling you, epidemiology another word ""liberal"", needed Trump look serious start making tough decisions state. Just....wow. Seen thanked 🙂 think absolut wrong get punished behaviour. Thank sorry bad english. tested hospitalized symptoms, positive results 1 weekly peak 12%, weeks 10%. testing widely available positive % results increasing. Hahahahahaha.. brigadist xD Oh, matter opening slowly. Ask Trump King, tell it. pretty shitty unit 1k now. 1 bed Fauci couldn’t forbid sale masks public. Accelerated herd immunity - facts reason... What? dont need police state enforce law. Businesses employees need get board. NJ businesses incredibly strict mask law. live 15 mins NYC cannot even step foot store without mask. Look NJ's trend new cases. Covid cases plummeted North East. dumbass southern states seeing huge upticks new cases may also mean younger people symptoms bad enough go get tested. Mr Irfan added flight attendants would gradually switch wearing face shields instead

Face shields legitimate PPE used hospitals, know people upset this. So, non-American, anti-mask? anti-common sense? wondering fringe cases already close developing severe symptoms Covid-19 brought point needing medical attention. ""Normally healthy individuals"" always right around corner serious medical conditions, especially start talking fringe cases. first comment dipshit. Breaking News: Water wet. hung dont worry... hate pussies Within 24 hours getting enforced. Hahahahaha....

**Its whether medications work different populations. PROVE. Vaccines need prove work (their efficacy) different important populations markers.**

Hair color would important variable genes involved hair color variations ones involved COVID vaccines work.

Proving vaccine works Black people important race effect COVID vaccines work might target antibodies.

I sit Institutional Review Board major research university. job approve research human subjects. scientist proposed test vaccine hoped would work people susceptible COVID, would ask ""who people?"" Since Black community disproportionately effected COVID, would absurb include research. would never pass board review.

I'm also Peer Reviewer academic journals. article came conclusion ""this vaccine works! Lets give people need it!"" would look methodology, see actually tested people need it. would pass peer review.

**So conclusion: Race important variable. needs tested.**

There btw. also working prototype vaccine MERS camels.

About immune system ""remembering"" SARS - know that. know antibody titers go time, necessarily mean strong enough immune reaction prevent infection make much milder still left parts immune system. could test challenging experiments, naturally done humans SARS...  Damn somebody get Tucker phone? said Yes, compensate 8 gallon man.  can't believe country sometimes. fucked far supposed ideals.  survive. like 99.5 percent people it. Zoinks took precautions almost obsession it. Im fucking pissed. wear mask. gloat it. Shoot me. Honestly town normally better deputy cop, Sheriff reelected can't afford piss people off. Oh, they’ll fine. They’re signing waivers saying won’t get it! That’s much effective social distancing wearing mask public! sign, that’s legally binding virus isn’t allowed inside you!!! course, share. 35 cases King County today ( 2.2 million).

Maricopa County ( 4.4 million) Arizona added 1400 cases.  Good isn’t better here. That’s common problem.

You think 130k enough buy 1.2 million starter home? place would easily 200k Reno.  teach trades again.

the trades still extremely well paying, less reserved friends family existing trade unionists women/minorities fill court mandated quota. ironworkers local around opens every year apprenticeships 1000 people apply less 100 spots. Pixels don’t lie trump. Trump wear mask, wear mask. fucking cult. Or, shows assumption (that 25% subjects infected) true.  Mathematically, suppose predicate assumption implies result R .  R.  Then,  (not R) (not A). 

Bad assumptions make good science. apply blood type AB? 

Also, B blood type fall this? lot expenses cost anywhere. Sure, housing cheaper, phone, car/rental/dog insurance, various memberships subscriptions remain same. I’m concerned spending $5 less there, like groceries gas barber. It’s things spend $100+ less care about. There's multiple stories posted half family dying virus two three people 20s 30s. surprised underlying shared genetic factor may make certain people vulnerable. like that's outlandish concept. agree! specifically talking US here. good gesture, compare $600 unemployment week, really much... Honestly, parts OC bat shit.

Title post also misleading. Leaves gym mask policy lack enforced mask policy. 

For hot minute thought wearing masks, hope humanity little restored left Gym anything members wearing masks working out.  fucking time!

I think friend takes care actual patients higher risk 😉

Considering higher risk contracting virus, wonder inform information local hospitals health department. 
You seem rely information receive strangers social media. 
That seem safe. 

As far know hospitals admit people need actual care tested positive ( already strained) hospitals advice peole stay home mild symptoms self quarantine. information available hospitals websites. I'd take semester break see plays going back.... Eeesh. work past future? branch science tackles Covid-19 Testing? Currently RT-PCR Antibody tests Covid branch fall under? mean Robert Redford. Common mistake least they're even considering it, Florida hitting new daily records we're still *this fine* mode People forget reinfected, studies suggest virus never really goes away stays dormant til gets activated again... that's scary part. ""*Kohli said Hart’s case shows patients may never develop antibodies virus, but, added, developing antibodies rare.* 

*Another possibility, Kohli said, virus became dormant reactivated like chickenpox possible ""never completely cleared viral particles"" never fully recovered.*

*The Centers Disease Control Prevention advised there’s guarantee virus give patient immunity*.""

Earlier today saw [There may immunity Covid-19, new Wuhan study . Yesterday saw another article someone reinfected. point know what's happening, studied. huge implications vaccines. One, apology calling VN ""rotten apple"".

There's always someone ELSE pay attention to, one group gets negative nosey attention time. goes cycles shifting alliances, relatives avoid while, fights pop heal - healthy, far nose phone culture today people forget communicate, even means arguing get along again.

I remember holiday, ten ADULTS sitting floor opening Xmas gifts actual elders got seats couches kids fit wherever. stepped people, everyone weird hours, like different level family stimulation could tune many people much going choice.

What multi-generational means today meant back then. Today like couple moving parents payment house pay debt. Back then, literally meant three generations extended family members living something like hostel built family members. scenario, believe healthy return degree, lead submerging ego, learn find quiet pockets time space wanted think (not hard sounds, sometimes happy someone comes along wants talk), falling asleep wherever, always people things with, always people around help you. actually think accounts many immigrants country successful even day.

Kind thought crazy pretty much throw job away (particularly since low chance seeing Covid patients), guess time like pandemic re-evaluate priorities. Smart 😂 lives pretty good life. I'm upstate NY we've able safely resume activities (small outdoor gatherings, restaurants retail open new safety measures). infection/hospitalization rates quite low- almost back March numbers.

I'm also super excited daughter gets real hs graduation. It'll actually divided 7 mini ceremonies parents physically present (livestreamed others) outside, stadium, social distancing. that's huge improvement drive event going have.

Cuomo perfect, good job getting curve flattened keeping reopening slow enough numbers keep going down. Seriously, everything know says really need wait entire month see full effect change. seems like people get desperate reopen, think metric magically change..

Hey worries. lie, StopHavingAnOpinion.

Every study done subject past 30 years said ""Wearing mask help stop spread disease unless INFECTED PERSON wear mask!""

When everyone wore masks? drop infection rates justify it.

With coronavirus new studies? 30 year old consensus challenged coronavirus damned infectious easy spread spread matters.

With previous diseases, worry directly sneezed coughed on. CoVid? sorta airborne short distance 6 feet so.  Many hardest hit nursing homes New York absolutely zero deficiencies following multiple Department Health inspections - matter try avoid transmission, even follow every law, rule, recommendation, virus get in.

 Holy shit fuck load cases one day! feel like point goes hard get groceries delivered really affect food chain Gee, wonder specific examples come mind? Ok that's higher official numbers right?   openings going come uptick numbers across board. can't hide disease

True extent, Texas particularly horrible controlling outbreak

As evidence, direct raw data. [Here's Johns Hopkins' visualization Texas new cases per general data data states/nations: Way tests done April May. naturally bring new case numbers up.

This partially true, mean think means. testing broad-spectrum across population previously people showed symptoms, yes, identified cases, dramatic increase increase testing overall. Also, trivial control factors (e.g. correlating death also massive protests going on, spreading covid even more.

This wrong. See data. numbers Texas declined slightly April began rising steadily May. protests begin end May / start please, stop advocating lockdowns help

Given lockdown slowed spread disease Texas least partially April, appears flat-out wrong.

Edit: moved citation higher comment. I'll leave - wish officials would upfront informative start, seems like lot people worried economy taking hard hit.

It’s longer “if permafrost melts” scenario, it’s “holy fuck permafrost melting massive scale RIGHT NOW” scenario, don’t know nobody talking it.

What's really going on? Without science humanity would living caves eating worms dark. hope case, sounds good me. lot time science *is* used merely political tool rise too. testing. spreading more. Ah, yes, viruses known politically motivated, surely much gain certain president re-elected. That's course issue. Well written Article. tables turned $20

This 1992, crap sell 60+ Welcome TLDR generation lol ""The media lies much cause 90% problems"" cry people see consuming hours day constantly sharing false articles photoshopped pictures Facebook. self awareness zero. live Florida grandmas nursing homes here, one Central Florida one South.

Well we're completely different discussion. said pneumonia deaths reported COVID. evidence that?


Dr. Birx also pointed US classifying anyone died COVID positive COVID death. I'm sure inflates numbers certain extent too.

Would say G. Fl0.yd. died COVID? would qualify COVID death. Oh, *that's* ladies can't see penis! Nah, think real, made up, flu. Plandemic. What's stupid point matter. God makes world every observable way looks billions years old. fine, go ahead study looks learn something world (even old looks) true. 

These people stupid particular hits home, currently re-reading final book. problems face globally 97, wrote them, ignored given lip service global governments 20 years now. Hm, side people shooting people random bold move, let’s see plays out... FL actually relatively proactive nursing home measures (though implementing widespread testing took way longer have). bit head start due experience hurricane protocols. AZ hasn’t though, refuse even release much data facilities (and went court it). Good, wish airlines would cancel flights florida, texas Arizona well don’t think goes deep all. Science fundamentally shows religion bullshit. That’s animosity stems from.  can’t even point Iraq map. upvoted you, too. generous, non-defensive response corrected information wonderful thing Reddit.

edit: missing word changed meaning. agree John Q. Public able trust experts say, perfect demonstration expert testimony pretty much lowest form evidence, peer review important. Deaths higher percentage new cases younger people now. AZ, we're predicted overflow end next week. Opening lockdown early clearly put us right back lockdown started. people wearing masks. Los Angeles. Bad ideas bad writing problem stupidity selfishness.
People can’t fathom something even slightest way hinders sake another person. masks 100% guarantee protecting yourself, I’m sure people would comply much more!

We entitled, selfish brats US, it’s gross. care others wear mask help slow spread! don’t understand science is. Science list facts. Science “is systematic enterprise builds organizes knowledge form testable explanations predictions universe.”

The facts uncovered science never taken without question. something new found, others check it. repeat it. say “well true, thing also true” check see is”. review data. publish metastudies. study something enough, eventually you’ll find something contradicts established science. double triple check everything. Sometimes find mistakes. Sometimes don’t. 

Climate change good example this. know climate change happening chemistry, physics, ice cores, geology, satellites, historical records, etc. occasionally study comes contradicts status quo. That’s say it’s wrong, it’s prevailing theory always one *best* explains data. TJ Costco best examples company cares employees customers. spots use regular lost business can’t even bother simple safety measures. No...not even remotely all. doomed repeat history due many citizens ignoring warning signs. western world stopped due coronavirus. It’s affects us. comes issues solved amount money less a. remember it.

Generationally, born third base, period post-war prosperity growth middle class, awful lot thought hit triple get there. already. say, I'm argantinian Man, I'm San Marino explain people daily basis. fucks sake, war zone scenario, 42 people die seems controlled. Kids school dick-measuring contest gets lower grade. 

""You got 63% exam? Well got 50% hah!""


 fucking stupid. increased testing. Hospitalizations going well. Prankster God!  Darwin award ceremony???  even beats UKs record. It’s comparison. Tons money changing hands March May still look stock market etc. economy never closed, selective businesses were, sucks. wasn’t everything! Yes, people Florida die heat. cold. Uh, tell climate change deniers, creationists, anitvaxxers, amd flat earthers. 100%. Anti-intellectualism problem unique one side political spectrum. Twitter, social media, certainly purveyors it. Depends whether Science science McDonalds little ago, one working (8 workers so?) customers wearing masks, let alone wearing nose. can’t even begin fill naive said is. Right safest going something friends long while. one help weigh risk, getting see guarantee. sounds lot scarier haunted house I’ve ever seen. I'm sure /r/conservative stroke.  understand crowded areas like DTL@, think exercising easily distance whole time always needs mask. Sweden knows fucked up. Man long ago foo wasn’t purely political. get this; agree shouldn’t competing suffrage olympics, dude...if go outside right you’d astounded lack mask wearing. Stores like Duane, Walgreens, co aren’t enforcing masks either. People chilling stoop, it’s fucking madness. Maybe neighborhood chill/logical, really good portion Manhattan ain’t mask wearing. Haven’t boroughs can’t speak them. Stop telling secrets. Also tell zinc.  news, water wet, SEEN STUDIES. Check mate, atheists. Nah, completely unexpected. I'm sorry upset losing discussion 14 year old. do? Perhaps. could envision system highest education budgets world still failing. parents students tell kids. Everything learning X lie, ignore it, I’m sure higher budgets could defeat situation. Anti-intellectual behaviors appear isolated money. seems cultural me. publicity stunt. really help companies like SurgiSphere creating fake patient databases research. direct evidence back this, really looks like pharmaceutical company (or one) might contributed certain drugs demonstrated work studies, HCQ went maybe helpful actively increasing mortality.

I'm super pissed MIL using evidence can't trust *any* researcher, complicit (never mind researchers discovered discrepancies first place, retraction followed pretty quickly). says Lancet *known* data tainted, simple thing, NEJM names mud now.

So yeah. Super pissed. course, fault can't come see grandkids *none taking precautions* son (my husband), well parents live us, high risk complications death COVID. Ugh.

Anyway, here's one source talks interested:  position scientifically backed? successes overseas? terribly sorry parents.  said literally anything. Also 1% different isnt big change FloridaMan rules! Florida Arizona two worst states different metrics articles posted today. Texas California almost bad, people, top 5 states worry well.

But Florida Arizona huge retirement communities, taught Florida two years, strike place people would make smart decisions. Florida man real, people around crazy. going bloodbath there. Living paradise vacation hundreds thousands dead semi functioning economy

Do realize deaths consumer confidence, labor availability, healthcare costs, etc? crashed economy. Possibly so, lot corpses deal with.

They semi-functioning economy now. think looking situation clearly. Chump buddies still made lot money it. manipulation. *puts joker makeup* “and here...we..go.. (again)” 200 passenger plane, 10 people die flight scary you? know 'cost us everything's? administration knew thing coming, hit, called hoax..... Ffs accused flip-flopping?

Never!

-DeSantis

PS I’m Governor FL fool proof supply Columbian Nose Candy

-DeSantis 90% certainly Depends definition cold, gets cold enough diseases like flu know impacted weather see seasonal variation. Right good news outcome positive, otherwise news Thought that. mother (a RN) said everyday patient dying watch. Including three work colleagues. last weeks, patients recovered fully. Hope stays way. mom PTSD they're trying force talk therapist work....... Apparently Solidarity study hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) cancelled now-withdrawn Lancet article showing HCQ *dangerous* published. study resumed withdrawal.

It canceled 17 June 2020, announced hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) arm Solidarity Trial find effective COVID-19 treatment stopped. trial's Executive Group principal investigators made decision based evidence Solidarity trial, UK's Recovery trial Cochrane review evidence hydroxychloroquine. Data Solidarity (including French Discovery trial data) recently announced results UK's Recovery trial showed hydroxychloroquine result reduction mortality hospitalised COVID-19 patients, compared standard care. Investigators randomize patients hydroxychloroquine Solidarity trial. Patients already started hydroxychloroquine yet finished course trial may complete course stop discretion supervising physician. decision applies conduct Solidarity trial apply use evaluation hydroxychloroquine pre post-exposure prophylaxis patients exposed COVID-19. Oh much country seems already that. roughly 5000 Swedish Covid victims, total 190 60yrs old. half people know NYC contractors, self employed, arts, etc. We're office jobs. Lots friends still dealing major financial problems right now. They're sitting around playing video games. Deaths next thing “bigger Texas”. doctors

Doctor Phil? 1020 month 1 bed college town Maybe ""Yeetus"" they're prepared toss Yep. see don’t want conversations devolve flame wars, number things get auto-deleted insane. Like, can’t say name guy killed law enforcement, thus sparking large demonstrations, entire comment automatically deleted. believe Gillum said fell depression. Life fucking sucks you’re down, keep digging. lost openly racist moron, that’s got make lose faith people.

Comparing 2 right now, see DeSantis Trump cuck marching ignorant people death see Gillum sad broken man fucking life. One significantly evil other. Remember every post hydroxychloroquine. test differently beginning, shorter swap, thinner head, etc. 

so probably find video recent one (cuomo maybe?) see compares felt Well, know, require logical functioning brain...so understand incapable understanding works correlating data understand situation. 

So magically percentages you, would change? Would enough say 'yes, surge deaths cases state leading hospitalizations' would still required point provide additional data one-track mind certain approach politics viewpoint? could told 3 months ago  virus seems guaranteed right bat. 

That would great name horror movie: Revenge Wuhan Bat. agree. Also, happy cake day! stuck seems like exaggeration. they've still got 3 years guess they're stuck Florida shit show. shut down, boomers kept hanging grocery stores home improvement centers bored staying home. parts state still vigilant social distancing (the non Trump/boomer centered counties). 

Others, including governor, following Trump narrative. Every day hear customers talking Coronavirus conspiracy, bad, exaggerated, etc. know anyone who's exist. Still wearing masks. 

So locals wearing masks social distancing. Add thousands visitors around country bored locked states visiting Florida. love sweet sweet tourism money care people dying, enforce mask wearing social distancing Florida instead leave people choose protect themselves. 

This shit going blow up. Almost 3,000 new infections day? seem like nothing soon. fucked. Pick good daycare? Unless daycare testing staff students right entering, daycare immune virus. Tell someone lost loved one TRYIN' KEEP US OUTTA DEL BOCA VISTA!?!?!? amount PPE eliminate infection risk though, we're talking staff working 8 hours around everyone breathing air. Unless they're sealed BSL-3 higher suit air supply, spread. many medical workers still get sick - least now, PPE. Even N95s good enough. helps course, basically need non-infected staff. best way prevent nursing home deaths manner deaths everyone take over-arching measures stop infection general population. always goalpost, assume everyone. severely lagging indicator look others stand wait. Yes lol. US death toll 117,000 rising; April 20, Trump said death toll would reach 50,000-60,000. Feb. 26, Trump said cases US would soon “close zero.” Tonight, Trump says numbers “minuscule” compare virus “dying Launching trials always good, even fails learn virus standard care rise mean, hiv easily preventable. Study showed mask important part. Worked Hong Kong.

I'll take it. bad flu season coronavirus arrived, need data deaths attribute COVID. nursing home numbers could use detail much excess last year deaths were. People winter Florida California good reason. get wrong, recognize necessity contact tracing fact lot tech companies great work area. I'm giving (pessimistic, admittedly bit defeated) reading social political landscape American. stop seeing beach photos like that’s problem. That’s like least likely place spread given open air sun people naturally set blankets away other. wear mask activity involves near people, dumb ignorant ape hopefully get asking for. can't stand stupid people. evolution gotten rid yet? absolutely 0 sympathy people refuse something simple wearing mask save lives, protect others. Shut fuck put on. forgot “thoughts prayers” part. Americans need part. get sick, going doctor, spreading areas virus ‘isn’t real’ begin with. 2/3 population crammed one small city. like every Icelander lives acre land.

A country's total population density really tell much people actually live. Guess depends ""cold"" means you. Us NE consider 0 cold. Im sure FL considers 50 cold Fake news... like breakthroughs... amazing batteries keep hearing last 20 years. refuse put mask..ok cool. proceed rufuse leave station, bold choice ok..Then take swing cop, expected happen? Right. plan lie American public instead tell wear masks... yup 

Great logic. I'm sorry hear that. 😞 don’t think Serbian government trustworthy organization. population density high, increasing cases, wearing masks, regards social distancing. face-shield offers additional protection, I’d rather wear not. that’s I’d like know - offer significant additional layer protection used N95 mask? Fuck people preexisting conditions. aren’t absolute perfect health life doesn’t matter. saw article guy died car crash, survived cancer 3 years ago it’s ok crash killed him.

How people think way ashamed themselves. hard time writing make point. really cool things nice places OC..

But people, Jesus. meal-ready mods, banned? becomes interesting question accuracy. doubt necessary, reporting deaths nationwide thousand, importantly reporting cases several million. antibody test would cost effective knowledge unless hinders thoughts daily.  people barely even want much. way I'm spending hot summer day amusement park wearing mask. I'll agree much least. idea pandemic-safe amusement park ludicrous, I'll staying home matter mask policy is. [Orange Masks help. Period. spreading misinformation, probably purpose...... rented beach house July 4th week south Clearwater. concerning see Coronavirus spike plan keep ourselves, restaurants indoor activities, wear masks go etc. beach never crowded all. don’t blatantly lie entire US population. California massive BLM protests, one going talk that? Moving goalposts deaths? I’m sure Florida discloses meaningful way. Get ready. won’t end well. Black Lives Africa protest? opposed born black mooching daddy government lol? See racism flipped? think that’s point. 543 people study, amount daily smokers small. “The rate daily smokers significantly lower COVID-19 patients, compared French general population standardization age sex” above? first protest Sacramento May 29. protests - would say 90% wore masks. far 3 people attended protests tested positive. cool story. stop licking window go play rest children 4chan. 100 years ago. way again. Many people means (internet access) much educated days, bother. like today’s numbers?

Just wait tomorrow’s! [magical make correlation without actually seeing data? know, asked for? I'm making assumption anything. 

You assume want; want know actual information. South OC wild grab bag levels caring COVID. could go one town everyone either wearing masks wearing masks.  dont say that, live FL.. uhh... gotta say tho, could.. Even gf dropping ball.. month ago, ""dont go out, use mask, dont let kids go out"" cool us go dollar store aloe.... Yeah.. gonna good.. dad went bar sing bar week later close cause someone worked it.. protesters FL reason bitches guy never new getting everyone sick.. idiots..  Fall gonna suck bad paper Masks everyone wears don’t shit .. company starting urge people return office absolutely need it. mind-boggling.  cut old shirt sock make quick mask. Point cover face. Wear scarf even. Distancing masks work crowded places like Houston many ""geniuses"" feel know deeply offended told do. would also good time many cities slash police departments budgets use money help people affected pandemic. really valuable info. light skinned one even take Vitamin winter cloudy days. wish people knew importance this. know 30. gets cold lol . mostly stays hot “You can’t say beat virus!”

“I didn’t say it, declared it.” Identity politics literally cancer. us already grandparents. Measles one side, flu changes every year that’s one single flu vaccine many. That’s get new one every year. Comparing vaccine vaccine flu futile. No, Trump presidency dying out, thankfully.  never going disappear. point measures never disappear. point stop living fear  Good. exposure =/= contraction though point 6ft rule near person 5 minutes standing higher chance transmission. 
Here's decent article subject: 
Relevant Although don’t know exactly many particles takes — 900? 1,500? — point bear mind you’re going contract Covid-19 single particle falls you.  need testing find people early. Fortunately much along used  assumed positive? get tested antibody point? Mission Trails Good, healthcare expensive.  Nobody wears mask netherlands one gives shit social distancing yet virus way Americans follow protocol? many deaths USA complete failure leader Government. Unlike actually took logic college. Logical fallacy's way disqualify facts. I'm showing qualified opinions support get college, they're going make write papers. papers thoroughly sourced cited undergraduates qualified source knowledge anything. think every time cite source, professor going dock appealing logical fallacy defer experts topics know little about. entire basis undergraduate studies learn find best sources information rely really care qualifications are, unless Pulitzer teach Harvard, position dispute best minds country say topic.

lol, amount faith NYT article quite staggering. 

I wonder college university went to, post riddled syntax grammatical errors, seriously lacking basic science literacy. 6 weeks generous. noted article limited number things like medical procedures. real opening happen 4 weeks ago even everything. slow process.

So Ohio reopen anything special. reopening much slower lesser extent many places middle spikes. fully expect Ohio start seeing increases cases things open (especially large places like Kings Island opening back soon).  Lol sounds like Florida okay get butt fucked oblivion. peak Florida never happened before, peak still future. Would support everyone wearing mask opening everything up? gambling vaccine works, waste time vaccine works, immediately market. Looks like triggered filtered word automod conclude conversation. Sweden higher daily cases deaths per million country whose healthcare system totally overwhelmed one major regions.

This opinion, fact.

Another fact sweden hit later european countries. Another fact density sweden high countries.

So given comparison norway, ireland, netherlands, france... got italy.

So judge good swedish response consider less density time act comparing first hard hit country europe experienced total healthcare system failure one major regions.

This alone give idea bad sweden handled situation. Abstract

limit bathrooms one person time (like converting individual bathrooms) using port pottys probably reason healthcare workers getting infected. lack PPE inadequate training. That's strange huge push making everything safe. DM come yell one girl nose. Edit: Maybe franchise store. really needs top comment Ahhh would suggest taking three year old public. Even worse don’t wear chin. That's nothing new them. See history healthcare reform &amp; gun control. better protect yourself.

I've seen Santa Monica too. There's certain false mindset makes feel Covid largely working-class/blue-collar/minority disease, upscale white professionals working home immune.  sure, hospitalizations trying flatten. Although I'm sure Florida regard. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA. Oh my. Oh yah. Common sense. Shits like specialty. feel hope may better placed elsewhere bud. got you, Someday second coconut ever hits head suddenly become happy person, kind thing able read about. right I’m bloody depressed, facts like make worse!

This argues might possible Covid cause large enough response immune system confer immunity. Now? NOW?!  feel like SLTribune ""hides"" things even worse. first started getting bumps cases couple weeks ago, noticed days set records, daily update state many positives reported day before, I'm supposing order acknowledge jump...whereas days daily case count less day same, state many day prior.

Of course, many us reading articles paying attention every day, obfuscation hardly works, they're certainly making much effort keep people informed trends....

I'm sure growth rate is...things looking good.  drug shown efficacy, know attention shown this. viable cure, along steroids could big vaccine. Uhhh 'a huge risk factor' far aware. go ahead feel good telling guy he's going kill wife. deaths deserve

:( Obviously I’m wishing people die, I’m realistic. deaths “trending” zero New Zealand, South Korea, Vietnam, etc weeks. It’s going go away US 25 states increasing cases dismissed youngsters time (accidentally correctly), people reacted pushback insisting beaches terrible.

All drive people indoors (as restrictions lifted) lead rising case counts. promoting *outdoor* activity along. Depends PA. Philadelphia suburbs, people give fuck actually follow guidelines. I'm proud people treating EPA. Dude that’s much maybe enough. Virginia majority, least swva still follow it. go DMV last week....stood line 17 people wearing them, none workers telling people to.  snowflakes refusing wear masks, screeching need get hair did. watch Florida turning blood bath. guess trying say world record, really crappy way say it. can't imagine someone actually considering baby long/meaningful life.

From understand lie, new explanation fact accurate, totally ineffective shortages PPE relieved it.


Frankly believe admittance. think making want say 'I wrong,' 'science process know time.' (however accurate statement would be.)


Public Health messaging episode disgraceful. Fauci part problem. zoo too, none animals wearing masks It’s almost everything past presidential candidate said correct 🤔

[...who could candidate  Damn, I'm sorry hear that. Yeah, tell, COVID really got footing here. think likely came Hopkins airport here. 

I hope feeling better! Alright.

Scientific studies sometimes strongarmed outside interests, a) scientists scruples b) research groups desperately underfunded. Kinda like sometimes actor absolute dogshit movie can't afford coke habit anymore.

We see studies funded particular lobby groups order particular agenda. Remember 7/10 doctors said smoking good, ""studies"" back up? studies funded tobacco lobby express purpose safeguarding sale product.

We see oil companies, data emissions climate change DECADES, fucking BURIED IT. committed irreversible rawdogging environment, buck.

And gullible dipshits think? think environmental lobby ones pushing studies kill oil. ""Follow money"", say. Yeah, industry think swings bigger dick, environmental nonprofits multi-hundred-billion dollar oil industry?


And media, which, guided profit motive, spins scientific papers headline getters. Remember one week, coffee bad eggs would fuckin' kill you, couple weeks later, coffee great eggs good actually?

Scientific papers may conflicting conclusions depending aspect system they're investigating. Maybe coffee ""good"" hepatoprotective, ""bad"" increases blood pressure. Maybe eggs ""good"" high protein relatively low fat, ""bad"" high cholesterol (fwiw conversion dietary cholesterol hdl, ldl, vldl highly individualized based physiology).

And scientists getting shit wrong. happens, part process. Fuck ups happen. Two months ago worried virus settling surfaces, thought surfaces could major vector transmission virus. we're aware, know surface transmission REALLY minor. know whether masks n95s would effective? No. know now? yes. make Fauci dumbass? No. partisan push discredit disagreement Trump? *Yes.*

And finally, usually scientific papers take MONTHS YEARS go proposal, grant, study, repetition, submission, peer review, publishing. We're REALLY stepping fuckin' gas right even smartest people field going fuck up. invalidate process whole? Hell dude embarrassed even thinking that.


Edit: wondered happened tobacco companies finally charade blown lies became indefensible? made [SMOKERS RIGHTS ACTIVIST Oh man. I’m wondering go get tested.. numbers San Diego look? Like hospitalization rates, test positivity rate ICU capacity?

Maybe reporting delay?

I thought California whole mostly control. countries reopened shaky policies best seem big outbreak ever rising numbers...What happened? actual asymptomatic rate low. Many lung damage cough/fever classified ""asymptomatic"". wrong. Since governor, tried understand logic last months. first outrageous thing said first time pushed forward something contradicts public health. pretty clear see Nebraskans equals population betters lessors. 

My conclusion line thinking heart wrenchingly cold. virus deaths inevitable thing matters hospital capacity. best thing economy hospital system handle. faster get herd immunity better choose lowest poorest risked herd meat packers convicts urban homeless soon homeless leave 'elite' unaffected.

Dime store Lux Luther flesh.   lol can't nothing better friends. he'll keep replying lmao  People done believe science shouldn’t get use form modern technology medicine. think science propaganda tool left. random sketchy blog saying vaccines cause autism Fauci pedophile get facts. ... mental health condition, disability prevents wearing face covering.

Does ""MUH FREEDUMB!"" qualify condition exception? Oh agree 100%. competent government response would help fix multiple crises facing, including stopping economic output helping increase consumer confidence going out. people felt like decent enough job containing virus would feel comfortable going spending money. people don’t feel comfortable going going getting business small part population problem stupid dangerous people taken care nature. type make bull shit this!!!

The real study needs done randomized trial early infected patients. HCQ antiviral, like Tamiflu. needs studies weird reason aparently studies never performed certainly FDA.

The fact Trump endorses something mean ineffective.

it’s one thing informed prepare worst, lot y’all seem like want bad possible say “i told so” see articles, data, serous decision 3 states getting hit hard states reopening reopens not.

Would settle anecdotal information? I've lived Texas currently Colorado. states similarly affected throughout earliest period pandemic (like neck neck). point Texas's cases started surging ahead ours, deaths increase proportion. 

Based numbers saw today deeply concerned Texas, ever before, although I've felt similarly they've consistently averted predicted disasters knows.

I keep touch friends family Texas based said, people WAY lax here. live specifically Colorado fortunate enough mostly spared--but still people largely complying safer-at-home orders. vast majority people appear still practicing social distancing wearing face masks (seems like least 80%). *This county mostly spared.* 

My parents, live third affected county Texas, reported gone sit-down restaurants twice recently group including grandkids without masks. flat-out insane me. Apparently city still even allowing dine-in service, maybe restaurants opting it, clearly done.

So there's bit info. offer Colorado Texas opened around time state level yet Colorado seen consistent decreases cases/deaths every day since reopening. I’m trying play acting responsible. want hear thoughts reality it. 

No vaccine, what, another year maybe 2? play head? going stay safe home 1-2 years? think people work every day won’t get exposed area provide food you? deliver goods you? people supply chain area people willing work sit house order another pizza?

Wonder states follow. very... painfully frustrating watch, doubt. fairness, researchers validated information collection / data points outsourced.

Will responsible researchers really purchase trust data anyone without reference checking data validation? Rental properties investment, people make investments make money. landlords simply make much money can, upping people's rent yearly they're moved settled easy way make money investment. 

Not saying right, money cheap last 10 years we're situation first place. Many people stuck rentals able afford home extended period 3.5% mortgage rates means many starter homes bought lower tier investors rent, less risk. rent less break even 3.5% rate, there's potential profit 15-18% interest rates 25 years ago. Back might well ladder CD's way less work renting property. turn artificially inflates market raises bottom end first time primary residents can't afford buy houses. 

 couple rentals rent every years little keep property tax increases happen, prefer solid tenant maxing profits. usually 3-5% increase, nothing crazy, necessary I'm going break even properties usually charge essentially equates mortgage maintenance. Back 2009/10/11 property values dropped taxes go up. tell norm. 

The concept ""enough"" lost country. me, someone pay property enough - hell enough. best get tenants would able buy home, hope make property home treat long, long time. many people money left table sake community. know?

Could make lots mistakes also like Sweden. problem “protecting vulnerable” incredibly complex difficult people might realize. many people living vulnerable frequently interact work, completely isolate them. Take Italy example, virus tore [multi generational result vast majority dead Italy people age 65.

Additionally, New York [22% confirmed deaths ages many age group underlying health conditions particularly common US like Hypertension, Diabetes, Heart disease, Obesity (although lot overlap). people likely working age people still worked led active lifestyle, completely different nursing home shows old people last years people *vulnerable* virus

Even without specific geographic cultural circumstances nursing homes lot harder protect you’d expect. They’re enclosed crowded living quarters act similar prison worker dormitory outbreaks. Infact, easily susceptible outbreaks [health care workers working long term care facilities brought back virus communities Take neighbourhood Montreal-Nord example. Home lot poorer immigrants, cramped apartments houses, many work healthcare industry, namely long term care facilities.

A vaccine successfully prevents Coronavirus, makes teeth fall year later whatever reason failed vaccine go make testing. China reads news article, china looks place procure tons sand, china looks Philippines, china sends ships take sand, Philippines nothing stop em. China acquires sand, china makes glass sand.

If desert sand kind sand used glass... Yeah freedom /s students actually study That's plausible deniability. So, say trying get everyone killed. choice stay home. NYC people testing positive antibodies accurate study. tests low specificity (cross reacting antibodies coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2) 


Also, it’s disputed antibodies produced. know fact. It’s whether trigger long lasting immunity issue. 4 months in, still pains chest.

Thank you!! true though  Let's remember Trump essentially 100,000 votes across 3 key states -- continue rise CV-19 cases. one party continues wear masks, virus going start changing political landscape.  So... appointed politician? pisses HELL even remotely political scientists say right glory fucking stupid.

I swear , need employ reverse psychology idiots.

You know would really libruls? GOP refused vote! read case survivors original SARS, many lingering symptoms mostly gone away 90 day mark post-infection. took longer recover.   Wait isn’t Florida popular retirement state ? government jokes “death’s waiting room “ 👍 June 10 Minnesota recorded total 8 new COVID19 cases. laboratory capacity obviously backlogged stopped processing tests riots. Also article states current spikes coincide Memorial Day Weekend ~today~ reached Monday GF died terms official totals.

It’s impossible know - likely see Minnesota sometime within next two weeks cases get dumped day register massive spike, people pretend didn’t know going happen.

This magical thinking. knew long time ago wait. doesn’t happen like go protest get sniffles go doctor get test added state totals day two. happens go home feel fine week time start feeling little ill infected family it’s two weeks feel bad enough present hospital treatment. week later mom dies.

It’s still unknown specifically blood type could increase decrease person’s risk novel coronavirus.

But Masks crammed inside key here. 

If you’re going packed bar restaurant without mask, you’re higher risk. 

Per article anyways. serves proof suspected begin with. 

Stay safe guys! Wash hands make sure you’re covering nose mouth you’re near others, especially packed place. bearer bad news, we're probably going get vaccine. They've trying HIV vaccine 30 years luck. Um, duh. strain SARs. particular family virus short lived immune systems 'memory'. likely got infected again. know docs article saying virus goes dormant, terrifying prospect. Generally agree, daddy's rallys debate. They're reinforcing biases whipping crowds geriatric frenzy. Maybe describe masks face condoms. arent 100% safe, pretty damn good job Yes. Anecdotes evidence.

The comment I'm replying suggesting long term damage likely cases clinically insignificant. Every time see shed tear joy think beautiful progress we'll make without around next year almost everything else going skyrocket price. 
Ah yes, perfect balance  high skilled worker category. remember Vietnam height pandemic, closed border stop international flight, large group Korean employees engineers still get allowed enter country factories they're investing Vietnam. course 14 days mandatory quarantine. aside diplomat, high skilled workers, especially engineers related work get exception ""god guns""? sound cool. Thanks reply making everything totally clear. Florizona. certainly enjoy endlessly circulating articles apparent reason though. quarter comments subs users agreeing masks beneficial. Thing like NEED get clarified. getting mixed messages since February. It’s time get facts straight second wave. Seriously. medical worker known better. question sort medical worker though... clearly highly educated one. Joe Rogan journalist. Joe Rogan equivalent homer simpson sitting couch zapping tv channels, that's guests. find people interesting things say invite him, prepare subject order meaningful conversation, jazz wherever goes goes. Mostly toward smoking pot, hunting elks martial arts. think depends you’re at. I’m socal/Santa Ana area saw probably 90% people wearing mask. odd see people without mask. Totally agree.  Probably even longer. Plus many asymptomatic people likely are, may take rounds protests see huge spike even low numbers first round.. ***Don't recall saw charts it***, know surprised.

Nothing response indicates surprise. Charts? mean studies? said, opinion (more hospitalizations b/c people hospitalized elective procedures find CoViD they're in-hospital) show time hospitalized time: Obviously increasing beds become available states learned dumb send people back congregate living facilities immediately recovery.*

If US -- remotely American hospitals work. lot friends MDs, given hospitals (the administration) want turn beds fast possible -- insurance pay people recuperate hospital (unlike every first-world country, recuperating in-hospital given). Nobody keeping CoViD patients one second longer to, especially many new cases every single day: [**Hospitals make room coronavirus patients trying treat people **.** discharged, people expected quarantine least 2 weeks home. Absent martial law / National Guard, currently way enforce *When look data, numbers US look similar UK France*

Then need looking reliable data. Here's site reliable sources use: OurWorldInData: [**Total confirmed COVID-19 deaths: rapidly mouse trajectories stand bold. (You also mouse table left help pick out, say, EU countries. tap curve, stay highlighted, compare two countries' curves.

You see US steepest trajectory far. France's log curve flattened, well US. US's log curve still increasing.

You look metrics site see US fares comparison rest world here: Coronavirus Pandemic Data Explorer China arrested Li Wenliang, also arrested least five doctors also tried inform epidemic.

This proof concealing epidemic. intention concealing, arrest people tell truth? that’s do. hands tied federal assistance. loans states can’t pay back. Sometimes per million statistics don’t make sense compare with. Small populations always fare worse. 

No. Congrats Virginia. Keep maybe avoid shit storm that’s brewing Florida, Texas Arizona. sending sick people nursing homes? ground infrastructure leverage USNS Comfort? NY poorly RI state troopers turning back cars NY license plates border. Look infections deaths still surmount anywhere else. get much anything together. Overall poor performance. protests local state law enforcement thrown breach without masks. Clever. think Americans largely forgot pandemic due massive protests. Basically coronavirus news cycle that’s now. makes think that? Found online. Need opinions.

I’ve personally used Elderberry tea help get rid flu like symptoms I’ve past months always worked. found elderberry Niacin it. 

The doses researcher (who banned Twitter) said sever symptoms, take 4 doses per day. 

2- 1000mg doses Niacin
2- 500 mg doses niacin. 

If light symptoms onset:

4- 500 mg doses niacin.

He also said use creatine monohydrate catalyst speed efficiency Niacin.

Personally, don’t think need 500mg per dose. 


Also Merck study said didn’t work, tried doses grams... milligram. much. intentionally tried disprove it. watch that. 

Just sharing. PM me, know time call perfectly succeed. 17% isn’t enough heard immunity.

Per capita London (27,345/8,961,989) roughly twice many confirmed cases NY (31,046/19,450,000) could mean 8.5% NY population antibodies isn’t enough heard immunity.

My point neither place enough spread heard immunity. well least Joe Rogan little bit self awareness, Shapiro really thinks gift god humanity Yes, always seems “just one week” away.

We’re specifically talking people protests. don’t seem contracted virus large numbers, going spread widely others? depends live, country etc. Show math. Show much almost negligible cost meal beans rice increase expensive meat.

Wtf Who? Joe Rogan mostly idiot, ability surround idiots like Schaub Bravo make look smart one. Slowing second wave much much much difficult first. really sure point is. 80% 100% dealing mass numbers protests, that's still covid spread. 

A reduction viral load 75% short exposure could reduce probability infection 95% more.

Even masks working 50% get 75% drop idea point rideshares. really hope youre trying say well I've done covid, proves spread covid.

While playing VR toys, I've working essential worker lockdowns. I'm one hotspots regularly come contact people care. travelers airport bar hoppers. stay informed you, I've shit around people since day 1 lockdowns. indisputable experience avoiding infection. actually done homework Li Wenliang. He's great whistle blower seem think is. heard outbreak notice went around hospitals. sent message SMALL group family friends talking new sars outbreak asked SAY ANYTHING anyone else. Someone group ignored sent warning much larger group message went viral. 

He also never officially arrested, told report local police station made sign document telling spread rumours.

I'm getting news great firewall, I'm Chinese, therefore China troll. someone gets thier news many many places well informed instead sounding like Reddit sheep. ppl make big bux live comfortably SF, meanwhile also lot ppl like me- worked SF, lived Concord, 75 mins 1 way commute driving Bart, Bart work, pay $900 room 2bed+2bed, apartment living room rented makeshift bedroom rent *only* $900

I also lived SF briefly, paid $900 month live city, share living room situation 1 bedroom apartment. think master bedroom roommate paying $1400, guy shared living room paying $900 each, total $3200 month 1 bedroom, 2014. total living square footage size full-size bed that’s (sleep single bed slim area left hang clothes) remember shocked many us 2018, especially running [this absurd exactly I've went it.

Misleading headline. 
Are really testing patients?

 Honestly, testing everyone hospital reason way new york hospitals got covid control able set covid areas/rooms noncovid ones. seemed impossible control keep area clean, felt like people constantly converting covid.

Any surgery needs known covid status, many surgeries involve aerosol generating procedures (highest risk transmission)

As new yorker, frustrating states arent looking worked didnt work. learned lot lessons, one testing everyone hospital efficiently separate covid pts. look every article posted sub contrary. figure key stability democracy country.

In place like Florida, beaches attracted tourists spring-breakers no-go pandemic. I'd also think beaches get crowded enough even reduced transmission outdoors might fully protect you.

In addition, many unknowns virus time. We've learned there's limited spreading outside. Yep. article: “We found use methylprednisolone early hospitalization beneficially affect body’s immune reaction systemic inflammatory responses – cytokine storm – COVID-19,” said study author Dr. Mayur Ramesh, Senior Staff Physician Henry Ford Health System Division Infectious Disease Henry Ford Hospital Detroit. also closing shitload stores Australia.

First all, urgent message world China came courtesy Wuhan, back January. Nothing virus's transmissibility tamed since then. So, pretty sure every informed logical person worldwide already knew China remains fully susceptible new outbreaks, even enormous ones. already know handle suppression hardcore fashion. Almost though value life subjects. 




The useful momentary snapshot ought give urgent notice world would seeing results similarly laissez-faire outbreak management styles Brazil, Texas, Arizona, Florida like. 



That's say now. Nope Right. Politics. politics. freedumbs. Bill Gates 5G get matter what... Well, hard say exactly. study done based 23andMe survey, done self-reporting. also really looking ""chance catching it"", asked respondents 1) What's blood type, 2) Covid-19. added hospitalizations blood type, boom, got results. reliable results debate, questionable even answers ""What odds catching it?"" question way.

However, better nothing. [You see exact numbers 23andMe rather relying crappy news articles reporting reporting it. admitting ICU elderly good way keep ICUs free. actually hospitalize people prevent death. let die home nursing homes exactly happened areas got situation control.

Experts say number reasons COVID-19 serious illness seasonal flu.
They point there’s vaccine yet COVID-19 community-wide immunity hasn’t built up.
COVID-19 also infectious flu higher death rate. 12x deadly flu.
COVID-19 also higher rate hospitals really empty existing ICU beds rather tried create ICU capacity. usually done repurposing areas hospital - turning previously non-ICU area jury-rigged ICU beds staffing beds whatever nurses available. frequently results nurses accustomed taking care ICU patients pushed role ICU physicians stretched thin 'regular' ICU patients COVID-19 patients generally dedicated COVID ICU. Strokes, heart attacks, severe infections, trauma things land people ICU stop happening middle lockdowns (well....maybe less trauma patients people staying home, get point).
Having inexperienced nurses overloaded physicians caring critically ill patients ideal situation, reason yelling staying home flattening curve. People age range get tested June. hospitalizations healthcare workers only. would significant? never thought young people (18-35) infected this.

If saw jump hospitalizations/deaths age bracket would significant. feels like sheep led slaughter house. Howdy neighbor! Per John Hopkins, there's like COUPLE countries mortality rate. Keep sucking Fox's balls. guys already around Cost Living insane.

Yeah! That's I'm confused about! Everyone complaining one wearing masks majority people see wearing masks. stores go require masks. even limkting amount people go time. times see people wearing masks bike trails run. we're outside. theres people really matter since we're far apart? 

I guess we're lucky living areas people taking seriously. really surrounding town/area since March. can't really speak neighboring cities South OC. thosesl stores missing two months rent they're already dead. Evictions blocked courts due moratoriums. Sure landlords nice care. ""And that's do,"" said Hodges, clinician Infinite Clinical Trials outside Atlanta.

The shit show everyone pissed allowed leave quarantine without tested first.
And seems follow rules set like may interacted friends along way. thus increasing risk all. sure mean outer boroughs. friend 2 bedroom decent part Crown Heights 1400. rent controlled supposedly.

Rent sucks, want live whatever outer borough is, find something sucks less. It’ll still suck though. wish could live parents now, live tiny apartments it’s option. understand saying. Why? masks aren’t worn properly ones don’t even filter virus you’re carrying it. It’s big circle jerk make others feel safe. It’s false sense security. exemption drive Auckland Wellington without stopping (toilet breaks side road!). meant stay one relative Wellington contact others. 

My understanding one parent died sisters travelling stay surviving parent. pieced together various articles/briefings could wrong (e.g. family guess could cousins married couple etc).

So long story short, exempt remaining managed facility exempt isolating general public. wonder much AirBNB? 600,000 AirBNB listings US, they're concentrated specific types housing: principally 1-bedroom 2-bedroom apartments major cities.

I friend completely remote &amp; moving Cali &amp; Arizona big difference. inspire others wearing mask social distancing? Thank god BigGretch Michigan   get wearing mask big deal many people. NYC one worst hit areas country. NY State pretty well things considered. 90% people see outside wearing masks. really take rocket scientist link two together. India well rare die disease unless old, poor condition obese. lot old people Sweden really categories, major risks definitely stay home.  Imagine every China news met FUCK USA! every US news met FUCK USA. That's so.... petty angry. Sit back, relax, smoke cigarette. Heard.... loud clear.... except tide going hard turn mask thing politicized 

I feel bad anyone Trump rally. Except campaign. deserve get live border MV Lake Forest nearly everyone wearing masks stores here

Seriously. I'm far I'd say ~95% people wear masks. see 1 2 people go store wear masks bandanas cut t-shirt style masks either.  first order thinking - two number don’t might together lockstep **does mean aren’t connected mechanisms.** 

The serious risk isn’t level, it’s systematic level. 

This whole thing frustrating talk coronavirus reddit, online, low information people - nothing exists vacuum. depend survival uncountable systems interlocked complex ways. individual systems come strain usually enough slack society deal crises. individual systems strain, meaning health people, economic strain, logistical strain sort thing, start running risk collapse one small system cascade unpredictable ways cause bigger bigger failures. 

Yes, virus isn’t deadly like Ebola, 1-2% death rate good virus contagious one is. 

But, highly contagious great risk lots people get dying failing healthcare systems can’t provide service *as much virus.*. happens, like New York, things get hand quickly. 

A tiny fraction country infected, everyone went started acting like things back normal would millions sick people once. Millions jobs done people sick. Millions deliveries necessary supplies slowed stopped. Etc.  SF rent control, age building different state, fyi. forget exact year cutoff, something like 1984. antibody test confirm Feb Covid. might flu virus/bacterial infection. 

Assuming antibody test accurate may well asymptomatic case Covid later. Nobody ever said going stop 100% (and lots people acted like goal).

You're misrepresenting said. 

We shut everything could put place strategies deal virus; PPE's, contact tracing, medical treatments, large temporary hospitals. 

Except Federal Government fuck that. shut nothing. want open back ***literally improvements situation since February***. Reopening lead 10's 100's millions dead. think going happen economy 1-5% country dies?

We're screaming want keep things shut want save 100%. know can't. We're screaming need keep things shut government fulfill end bargain, like every first-world nation planet already done. Joe Rogan shambles. agree 100% say depends worked there, busy store is.

Either relevant business store demanding cashiers. gout. become immune virus like year so, case many coronaviruses, plan society? case, neither natural herd immunity vaccines would work. options have? reopen society accept life expectancy drop? think politician policy maker willing even openly think scenario. course will. ability suppress point test, trace, isolate relatively effective. cats bag, leopard like. Ouch, really blows. :(

I've lived Palms Koreatown would recommend both! Palms pretty suburb-feeling bit cheaper (I saw decent 2/1's around $2000-22000) plus Culver within walking distance lot it. Koreatown wonderful pre-Covid ton stuff easy access DTLA purple line. Good luck! Lupus. I’d it. Even person classes I’d willing somewhere like UCLA offer online option. okay going back campus maybe move somewhere cheaper live campus apartment. SF Silicon Valley particular unique climate find anywhere else planet, combined beautiful mountains around. That's people enjoy living California general. that's real estate would always expensive there. CCP

It's much easier dismiss anything negative bot/motivated party rather accept others could find better expected. 

Although deferred forgiven debt might small part, people still take good news late fee waived even still owe rent. principle applies.

Also, debt forgiveness one part it.

""*Chinese leader, speaking pandemic summit, promises help building hospitals sending medical experts African countries* "" Wow that’s incredible commitment keeping others safe. type 1 diabetic really appreciate that! 

At point, really don’t worry much NYC. Cases incredibly low compared population. think you’d fine mask staying 6 ft away people. It’s fine me! Thx ""apology"", ""professor"". Strange Ive seen paramedics skip eyes seen several times news photos. virus care protest? 

Not people get infected/killed reckless protests care protesting?


Right, protests equally valid? also less likely take proper precautions Yeah, Tibet part Chinese Empire long time last time checked Empire kind fashion. know whole self-determination thing. travellers, must come low-risk places, eligible quarantine hotel shortened seven days instead. fifth day, tested coronavirus, result negative free engage business activities. monitor temperature health 21st day visit, must keep record people see. They’re also urged avoid public places much possible, wear mask about. give flying fuck people get virus die stupidity. they'd end infecting other, vulnerable people, inexcusable. worry, celebrate heroes. wrong side it, it?

Also bold assume I'm American. else expected anyway?  Sure, blame Fauci clear masks beginning data coming COVID-19 transmitted. doesn’t president try emphasize need masks know? He’s one people listen right? stay there, entitled jerks poor, imprisoned forced work believe masks evil plot given go ahead go whatever. least poor folks excuse. work.

The rest stupid selfish. excuse that. Right! course. 

I really kind curious author got 8 months figure - wrote contact information. hope hear back Mr. Pavlovitz. that's real social interaction know it. signs ending Qatar, Chile, Singapore Kuwait higher numbers developed reliable? Why?

Why developed anything COVID? Vietnam low GDP handled great. It’s really outliers. Homeless youth actually major issue US. haven’t kicked out, many were. It’s one things people don’t like discuss much. It’s seen pitiful, “not problem let’s get involved.” 

I glad able help few, truly incredible. 

But 3 helped tell 6, including partner, kicked beat parents. ofc recourse socially legally. 

Doing this, gay number reasons, taboo people won’t even discuss pretend didn’t happen. many parts US.  could work, would deal countries decide upon strategy different countries? would also say countries different, solution Germany might viable Greece instance due different social institutions, traditions resources. essential worker wearing mask SD several weeks work; stupidity can’t fixed. I’m nervous ever one hand, he's saying prepared life pandemic, even know masks effective? guy whole country puts trust on? right everywhere Tampa/manatee area extremely crowded. Like June 2019. Beaches, Walmarts, malls, mom pop stores... Everywhere. started using respirator ) P100 cartridges yesterday. think they’re sufficient?  I'm supposed care bad things happening people (in case guy forcing wife quit job), caring disease?

He obligation clarify want people believe said did. clarify, thus people believing made decision her. CDC purely saying ease consumer's fears. flat lying. Studies already show virus survive air, surfaces like wood, paper, plastics, glass, metal varying amounts time. pretend like virus magically dies outside packaging pure stupidity. Hope never visit shithead! Lots people stupid. Flat earthers, antivaxers, liver detox followers, climate change deniers, on........ hard concept understand? However ""hard"" region hit right now, would hit harder colder. basic critical thinking. Even Dr. Fauci said advised baseball play Fall gets colder. 

Aus NZ cases summer covid hit countries summer. unexpected. Covid barely spread Australia. 

BTW..none states mentioned hit hard. 

There contradictory studies temperature. posted one. could post several. Covid spreads temp. able fight easier summer hotter months immune systems stronger. Pls see edit. 


I wrong apologize. think CDC smart enough know don’t normally see 120,000 counting fatalities flu season. fact, number exceeded 1918-19 season. Talk Union say feel safe going back work ask ensure safety. unions. im conversation matter bad states ruin progress. much OC honestly

Wait, what? live too, theres way many wearing masks know arent required to. Greg. completely dismissed letter mayors sent begging state-wide mandate. By, mentioned, parroting bullshit ""individual responsibility"". Bexar county figured little loophole game, doesnt mean he's good guy purposely chose reveal loophole asked thought finding it. hide counties...hes making damn game.

Its political theater him, evidenced little game nonsense, keeps using exact speech everytime someone asks ""why cant mandate masks, important thing help stop spread virus?"" ""Individual responsibility."" didnt reign Paxton threatened cities following *his own* orders punish people wearing masks, he's letting Ted Cruz damn idiot celebrating idiots enables wear masks....for following order open salons?

Can see I'm pissed him? He's taking fucking seriously he's failing convey straightforward direct simple message **masks work fight virus**, allows stupid stunts happen make stupid residents Texas think stupid stunts what's expected. doesnt go say ""hey, good thing. Please dont think right."" many people dont care that. focuses hammering ""individual"" bullshit importance following best practices fight virus that's causing pandemic. afterthought vomits speech ""texas freedom"" appeal masses much fucking patriot whatever ""rights"" ""freedoms"". fails convey public COVID doesnt care either those.

I'm glad figured shit *despite* him. Despite idiots think virus gone fake. Maybe things slow down, know things *calm* down, may late time Fall comes. I'm going go shit know stupid Texas. I'm lucky city blue others, damn still alarming many people dont care. regular booster shots yeah that's social norm decades. Half died Italy, Spain, France, Germany, Belgium, UK also nursing home residents. NY/NJ specific issue. virus fucking evil.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* know something protests?

its linked major outbreak. 3 weeks since Trump authorized use military protesters. That's 5G for, silly goose nyc population density take huge percentage population fill streets. went home school mid March, wore N95 whole way airport aircraft. looked stupid, sure, I'm 3 months later totally COVID free. Blessed Jeez! telling people destroy livelihoods, give jobs, social life, seeing family something won’t affect 99%+ people. DONT understand? 

Nobody knows vaccine created.. there’s estimates that’s it. Economy directly relates health poverty, fact don’t understand makes question old / you’ve ever worked pay bills.

You want US shelter till gets “money/resources”? We’re already $26trillion debt lol. Money worthless locked Indefinitely due inflation. people lives, maybe don’t want everyone locked miserable you? Bay Area seems place country requiring enforcing masks. Also, reopening slowly, won’t bars gyms open August. Really shocked friends family parts state people stores without masks on. literally officer front store allowing people without mask. Deerfield Beach South Florida (in Broward County). quite different areas north. Masks required stores here, restaurants respecting social distancing Miami-Dade starting heavily enforce it. Bars closed since March able open yet.

North Florida, Jacksonville, Tampa, panhandle like another country. Tampa last week total free-for-all. Nobody wearing masks stores, people looked like fool wearing mask inside restaurant get take out. stories groups people getting sick bars coming Jacksonville.

Look data here: Beach seen 273 cases since March population 81,000. 
I think would fine, responsible use common sense. spiky case line right now... forming mt. Everest now? much spikes yet government citizens thinking ""meh"" long Florida... it’s nice know you.  Agree. But, beneficial current strategy say plan open. instills confidence, early August announce reversal. Bloody hell well written Lol, much travel southern Oregon Northern California. say Northern California, talking way north Sacramento Bay Area. spike cases California mostly LA.

Oregon sort spreading event likely. I'm looking I'm seeing experts support protests, although media still acknowledging public health risks. criticism lockdown protests seems response intent protests, simply fact people gathering.

Correct I'm wrong, I'm seeing huge shift part health experts. I'm counting politicians views expected consistent. know someone michigan spent week hanging OK (and brought kids)....and social distancing taking precautions whatsoever....and staying w person also doesnt take seriously traveling staying texas frequently(and recently last weekend numbers crazy there).... even family get together left go back tues incl person got back another completely unecessary 4 day stint south texas. may surprise find many minimum wage workers one job. employer won’t give 40/wk doesn’t mean without. find another low wage job employer won’t give enough hours qualify benefits cobble rent together hair every month. minimum wage many big American cities, might working 28 hours/week two jobs driving Lyft barely make ends meet PTO health insurance trouble. great news. means also music festivals outdoor sporting events! envy guys riverside!!! crude cloth mask protect significant extent well everyone else

Until saturated around 15 mins so. really protect all

I wonder thoroughly people cleaning (if all) breaks heart. poor parents. Trader Joe's best safety precautions store I've recently.  Yes, lots people, we've known possible since January. take month.

It is, however, rare, roughly 1 1,000. BS Flintstones documentary said, know exactly Swedish officials making totally empty promises increasing test capacity weeks figuring anything out. 

Look test figures Västra Götaland - week 22 tested around 6000 people, week later tested 15,000.

They capacity, simply using due criteria place. opinion, criteria designed prevent majority cases tested show published figures.

That seen simple chart number new cases per day - growing rapidly end March criteria changed, ""plateaued"" period restricted testing, skyrocketed criteria expanded.

[New Cases Per Anders Tegnell talking plateau, knew limited testing actually expecting rapid growth see expansion criteria. That's sure ""herd immunity"" would reached weeks.

They publishing one set low numbers based limited testing, calculating ""herd immunity"" based another (hidden) set much higher numbers expected really happening. wish CA four five separate states. Maybe day. think read somewhere people living places militant insurgent resistance state power eventually get blase things like car bombs life while. quest herd immunity uncontained spread think still poor strategy.

Especially considering nobody knows recovering virus make immune. canada everything closed except big grocery stores walmart, strict entry policies limiting many store. parks public spaces shut down. takeout, etc.

In Berlin know whole neighbourhoods didnt follow guidelines. *Plus* massive lockdown protests going way back April there, continued rest country May June. 1000s maskless people protesting crowded situations.

So idea ""Europe shutdown way better"" seems weird me. felt like Ontario shutdown way tighter. longer! opened outdoor patio dining ""small store"" shopping last Friday. Still cant gatherings 10 people. tourism. events concerts. still locked pretty tight whereas much Europe almost back normal, despite much severely affected.

So statement baffles North America, US Canada included, half-assed lockdowns relative e.g. European countries, Yet he's self-described germaphobe that's hold massive gatherings infected areas country... wearing requiring mask?

I think narcissistic sociopathy makes *illogical*. Also people going water, chances sharks returning goes exponentially. *freedumb I'm you. I'm terrified. government deemed human life unimportant really say. one really wears mask anymore either. face shield idea else protect indoors. issue things confined person. Someone dying diabetes cancer risk anyone else, like terror attacks pandemics are. heart disease could spread like flu people would panic too. tbh really make much sense unless they're also foolishly ignoring possibility creating people dependent state disease sure substantial disability burden. cold, calculating sense much worse hit economy create disabled person unable work needs support young person previously health productive let old person needs support stay alive. disability burden outweighs costs save getting rid weak, approach even make (cold, calculating, evil) sense.

Yeah makes sense.

Uness privatize health care stuff point. disabled would fend themselves, problem state?

IDK, hard make sense sure Denmark would happy help Sweden testing Swedes asked. weird haven't. 

Of course. expecting happen. hasn't. cities would enforce heavy fines and/or imprisonments. Getting there. Tuesday’s total case count less Monday’s total case count = Tuesday’s reported new case count. Cases outcomes (recoverer vs death) nothing running total case count. say masks important preventing spread there's short supply instead lying masks work. guess really know asking looking that. Bay Area complete mess. Thanks noodles. Fauci's response lock eyes make facial movements 30 seconds continue press briefing question went unasked. virus supports position feels freedom liberty important preventing disease. virus stands governor. Oh bless you, meant G.eorge F.loyd bot kept deleting comment political. kind though. Burr acts like know. He's clearly well read subject. Saying courtesy wear mask, shows that. Joe thinks mask person wearing realize people around person wearing it. People proving long-term negative effects, saying there's potential it. people disregarding point cause there's proof (cause literally possible proof they're demanding) behaving recklessly considering possible consequences. People scared take precautions. Hard imagine getting 330 million people vaccinated within month vaccine created. seen average nyc apartment? I'm starting realize passing day, everyone keeps telling can't save everyone refuse give anyone life. 

I've accepted way people look think me, care. know, even prevent one person getting infected worth it.

Note: mean people allowed fun, meet park wear mask, wear mask general tbh. Covid's going anywhere anytime soon, attest take bare minimum precaution wearing scarf, mask, cloth, whatever mouth nose. think opposite. Europe needs make joint effort this. It’s built free movement free market. Countries need work together beat this. look union whole response chaotic everybody fenced themselves. really. get R 1 protective measures need `100*(R0-1)/R0` percent population it. use protective measures generate effective R say aR look `100*(aR-1)/aR` number less number immune spreads greater doesn't. herd immunity theory longer spreading protective measures removed. generates new bR new protective measures `aR &lt; bR &lt; R0`. 

You keep iterating policies downward (or upward surge gets large). Covid cases drop protective measures removed. people get matter math. 

Let's say R0 2.5 means 60% population needs Covid get herd immunity. ease example assume care people (mask wearers example) half population non wearers half. Assume non-wearers protective measures effective given day non wearers 4x likely get things equal. get 60%
85% non mask wearers 25% non wearers it.  

If R0 gone 5 (i.e. got contagious contagious assumed) 80% population numbers like 92% non-wearers 68% wearers.

The careful people careful perfect. often make roll dice often get unlucky. Definitely agree outdoor setting better indoor bars, etc. also think hard believe herd immunity help. think study found 24% NYC, also herd immunity considered like 70 80 percent (think flu elderly, approx 25% help.) positive outlook antibodies also know means terms immunity spreading others.

I'm hoping fellow New Yorkers try reopen stay safe continue masks. think middle ground prevent death Someone commented different post face masks social distancing aint mandatory right now....how crowded public areas now? Well, reading thread worried filter life p100s

Figured 3M made adapter reason. I've heard friends friend involved app company owner took app (paid government) relative Domminic Cummings.

Does anyone info know even remotely true? I've tried Googling companies involved couldnt find anything. Theres good chance complete bullshit figured I'd ask case someone else knows something.  go drugstore yesterday, ofc wore one half people on, mention price gouging throw away masks. Glad around months ago got box like 1/4 price lol. Given NY/NJ SNF death rates mimick SNF death rates found Italy, Spain, France, Belgium Germany, I'm sure much impact Executive Orders actually had. 

 Becausr based testing consistenly ramped up.

My county California (not largest) testing double many people day entire state April! die thirteen months something totally unexpected? Seems like reasonable answer question, would acceptable answer standards? require name, adress social security number person?  Yes could clarified, to? assume worst? point can't understand really worth effort. Feel free outraged. Jackpot Man good comment, stop downvoting watch Star Wars Episode 1 !!! hahha idk. i've worked walmart 30-40 hours felt soul sucking 60-70 hours nurse. automotive - forget one! seem happy announce it... Yup, contagious heart attacks, right?  probably wear passing people? mean super depressing. it’s circle life heirs rather evenly split cash fight stuff. forget 12 000 tobacco related deaths per year Sweden. Outrage still legal smoke. care people. Maybe address shortage explicitly state N95 professionals everyone else atleast wear cloth bandana. 

Something ""masks work, wear one"" would nice rednecks socal wearing masks ""trump CDC said so""

Great, people thinking ""the CDC lied time, listen next time?""

It adds distrust CDC... people think 5g towers coronavirus vaccine get us. 

And no, sorry get blame sacrificing healthcare workers lives. 

If spend 3 months ignoring intel reports coronavirus warnings could stocking PPE lie everyone save what's left PPE supply, that's you. 

So top ill preparation want lie American public masks? 

No. Two wrongs make one right. Ohioan here.

We locked early. Including schools events. Early March big events cancelled. 

I think huge impact state (despite attacks Governor DeWine Dr. Acton) open less virus overall state spread.

Places like Arizona etc never shut like did.

The danger see well feeds deniers want go back 100% normal. success actually hurts us ways.

This makes nervous fall. good posts. one forcing read truth. February? like 1968. Yes that’s number higher agree part, I'm sure media whole really board current protests. news sources read sympathetic, standard given sensitive topic, health experts quoted, generally endorse large gatherings. Outside sporting activities resuming

**Outdoor spread** thing though. seen outbreaks tied Floyd protests ReOpen protests month earlier *screams pouring keyboard*

It’s like AIIIIIIIIIIIDDDDDDDDSSSSS!!! know live, I'm gonna assume Stockholm, reaction absolutely ridiculous areas like Gothenburg... Amazon, go 3Ms catalog search specific model#s turn prime only, shipped sold amazon.com only.    *am* listening experts *why* think big issue made be. fresh one new causes death added? last looked included major ones 7% total I’ll always trust “masks aren’t necessary public” CDC also recommends nurses reuse PPE lmao Here's latest graph Arizona's cases definitely going up. deaths remained constant far. antibody thing appears CDC endorsed yet (which done yet studies proving accurate antibodies actually provide immunity)

If/when CDC changes stance I'd expect EEOC follow suit lock go government officials health officials systemic murder Nobody could seen coming... Lmao. Governors states blm protests, media encouraging it.
No blm protesters charged breaking lockdown orders. 
Looters let without charge too. understand even tested meeting President. tested, it. add one count unnecessary?

/s appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* good Report him/her local housing authority look pro bono legal assistance, works part take action. think Mask burning protests, calling people wanted slower re-opening cowards also pretty disgusting convenient say haha Americans! Cletus wants haircut! Trump! get high fives you’re paying MIT, you’re gonna want paid that’s best interest students. sisters college poll like 90% person transferring. People want value. MIT handle it’ll fuck lot small schools Don’t forget they’ll also signed waiver. Yep, could possibly go wrong ? surprise all. Seems like getting harder tested sure ""big city elites"" this? means *outdoor* spread really happen. ReOpen protests Ohio month ago, Floyd protests three weeks ago. I'd guess need make new city ordinance order actually means something legally. America would politicize mask wearing mask wearing ugh someone lives Paso Robles, video seriously disturbing..
Iv seen many people masks nose here, also less people wearing all. think people bored tired careful.

Source : kind people spend money trying convince people wear masks? mean better things spend money on? I've decided game, grocery store 10 packs surgical ones going offer people.

Also going keep wearing P100.

Saw thing could get cartridge style filters could N95 prefilter really want order it.  bad people sides... agree, hate say advocate listening experts. one pure stupid, something. suppose want incite hoarding, good expert advice. Wear mask, say now, make sense. sick? sick hospitalized? hospitalized, hospital capacity? feel like we’ve lost sight trying accomplish here. original goal never conquer virus. won’t work years vaccine data work with. goal avoid situation hospitals can’t take care sick. That’s it. AFAIK US, hospital systems overrun. focus infections displaying symptoms... everybody earth exposed eventually. people spit people wearing mask? Daaaaaanm!

DeSantis: See evil, hear evil, speak much evil. Here's latest graph Ohio's case/death numbers (from pandemic stat tracker true, state appears still flattening somewhat.  remember seeing Facebook summer comes ""heat"" weather change would kill virus make spread less. Can't imagine memes got wrong. /s Dude fat old silent spreader.

When gets it, we’ll know.

God, hope it’s soon. Thank much service! really thrilled places won’t let people without face masks. CVS huge dude black military type uniform let anyone store without one. Even teeny, tiny, Mercado shop wont let folks without masks everyone working uses nitrile gloves. made mistake stop Walgreens days ago. sign door said “we encourage wear mask.” Half customers weren’t wearing masks one working store wearing gloves using hand sanitizer ringing customers. cashier put bag hands felt creepy sorry hadn’t protected employers. Luckily, wearing gloves time. wish reinforced mask wearing stores protect folks work there. won’t shopping Walgreens again, even eventually find vaccine covid. don’t like places don’t take care folks work them. Good freaking luck. People ignorant follow rules. Wow, third! terrifying! Oh realized were. Ive met many years ago meet big warehouse. friend Aaron's. Im working Woodlands Parkway, one mask site me. Bro, super easy, stop testing want number go down. like restaurants, churches, house parties.

, packed indoor political rallies masks considered signs weakness, ... Southwest PA. Mask usage getting worse every day. know multiple businesses last week close due employees testing positive. know another business demanded employee high likelihood potentially exposed return work self isolating testing could done. There’s Walmart Giant Eagle nearby town hasn’t mask policy weeks fear guest complaints. 

Yet one wants address it. GOP lawmakers want impeach Wolf remove emergency status. PA great let’s care anymore attitude going dangerous. you’re okay little added cost, Costco delivered via instacart. also used without membership. Throwing kid curb burn literally social bridges. shit never well. Sure, wear mask
There many deaths time family member needed test week. call three testing sites find available appointment week. actually true. Science ""prove"" things guarantee factual information, science set principles techniques discovering truth. relies acknowledgement knowledge perfect make mistakes.

Unfortunately, people realize think anything scientist's mouth inerrant, find one scientist's claim turned true lost faith science researchers. someone lives OC disagree understand you’d think that. smart. flight sunlight heat kills it. definition would propagandaist we’re allowed screen drug usage? Even though tests don’t necessarily detect you’re influence moment... assuming he's actually looking. I'm fence here.

As employee, want employer dictating medical tests must essential job.

But also work hospital think everyone screened asymptomatic cases account large amount spread.

This think routine population sampling systemic left potentially abusive employers whim people care. heal wounds culled herd first... Definitely. I'm assumed positive was. symptoms still dealing 124 days later. r/covid19positive many us chronic illness now. 

There benefit get test. I'm ill enough hospitalized (there 5 days tempted). need prove sickness get sick leave. work computer remote friendly. 

I wear mask social distance would practice either way. Reddit. Everyone sub expert epidemiologist. mean, accountants programmers Target check clerks 4 months ago, they're tenured epidemiologists. need provide source. source. know, interesting fact Japan, reported 17,000 ""cases"" conducted 348,051 tests -- country 127 million people living dense cities!  Meanwhile, Florida, state 21.5 million people, done 1.5 \*million\* tests. 

I find hard believe Japan 17,000 infections -- much likely they've simply ignored lot asymptomatic mild infections. (Even Georgia conducted 2x many tests Japan!) 

At point, maybe ask value seeking every single infection -- clinically meaningless ones -- result society -- especially schools -- never restarting every day scary nightmare rising cases (mostly asymptomatic mild)?  

This maybe another example thinking straying towards right-wing (i.e. ""more tests = cases""), there's truth logic, EU CDC -- dispassionate politically independent organization -- said much regarding Poland Sweden. odds lawyer get 10 M? Today's day age, would surprised. Johnson Johnson accused convicted lying safety products like every year since 2007? wrong? swear saw graphic somewhere. I’m Oklahoma. aren’t morons. theory:

It’s next California. reason Connecticut got slammed NY. That's assault. What's misconception? Florida reporting 3,000 covid deaths 5,000 pneumonia deaths. logic accounts 3,000 pneumonia deaths - accounting extra 1,100 pneumonia deaths 5 months Florida last year?

Edit: that's every covid death also recorded pneumonia death. Darth Vader, OG social distancing  Yeah, lots people would moaned, would right move.

It would politically courageous quite intuitive (I mean Trump thought logical, can't much past ELI5 level), political courage ample supply.  I'd start looking new family.. :( NY Governor Cuomo said considering order quarantine travelers FL said health experts advised so. Maybe PR stunt get attention. Or, stupid. many died cancer, heart attack naturally? really wish governor scared make hard calls. wish would say ""stop children, wear fucking masks! mandatory now!""

Someone 35 possibility dying serious side effects covid like anything else chances extremely low compared 35. I've seen somewhere ballpark 2x chances death/disability car related accident.

But that's point. feel invincible still care people around aren't. None feeling invincible, learning think beyond things impact you, worry health also protecting people's. two mutually exclusive. ""may""

As long case, someone else guinea pig, I'm taking care health. I’m saying there’s increase testing. I’m saying others dismissing spike due increase testing. dad told growing catch someone lying you, person liar, treat everything tell such.

There actual cases, real number people infected. don’t know number is, it’s important one. 

Then confirmed cases. test estimate spread epidemic, it’s always fraction actual cases. 

If human behavior (masks social distancing adherence, etc) spreads virus faster cases resolve, epidemic grows. grows steady rate new actual cases double every X number days. 

Confirmed cases doubled 7 days. question closely confirmed cases tracking actual cases. it’s close yes, severity situation double every week. 

The climbing rate test positivity suggests actual cases rising even faster confirmed cases.

Have nice day.  Legit upcoming movies want drawn political controversy,” said Aron. “We thought might counterproductive forced mask wearing people believe strongly necessary. think vast majority AMC guests wearing masks. go AMC feature, certainly wearing mask leading example.”

This also politically controversial stance. hit nail head. Described perfectly. 

Somehow many people act like reason, argument, evidence -- process separating wheat chaff, true false, likely unlikely -- democratized. everyone equal say equal competency here. method method arriving conclusions good other. 

Flatly true. 

Furthermore, lot people think freedom speech, freedom form judgments/opinions, involves freedom criticism. course idiotic. voice opinion publicly, opening public criticism opinion. 

As far back John Locke, people talked alternative freedom opinion. can't enforce rules people's mental states, can't done even someone wanted to. 

So yes, nature everyone enjoys freedom opinion. slides ""don't give pushback dumb shit say publicly, view, right it!"" attitude gut equally reliable rigorous science... hell knows.

At press conference announced antibody result blood donors even lower 5%. One pretty much infer statistics 40% Americans anti-science. bode well future here. Part problem enough *real* scientists public sphere. hide labs squabble minor details race publish papers, yet scientists utterly failing educating public simply visible. 

As chemistry grad student, truly disgusting many academia loathe teaching. PIs want write grants get published, never leaving confines office. give shit professor certainly inclination actually educate public. need scientists educators strong public profiles. need loud scientific illiteracy part help. politicians become beacons junk science one calling it.

We need better. knock it. Maryland flag best flag. dude camo Add whole mask debacle, perfect recipe for, today, many people confused mask work not.

They do. Trump thought going Epcot center need worry. like we're dumb enough hosting largest indoor gathering world since beginning pandemic... think seriously overestimating intelligence education people US live OC near beach, already here. see tons AZ, NV, UT plates around here. real, dude fuckin Trump's rally going complete utter disaster. funny thing he'll probably blame Antifa spreading virus arena bullshit like supporters believe it. truly feel bad wish harm anyone - possibly willingly go rally?? Lmao South Korea's method reducing cases 0 infrastructure place. High ratio tests positives rate, robust contract tracing program. US proven time time unable provide infrastructure. Maybe NY state better position that, argument. Infections far endemic think South Korea's approach help us.

My initial argument based news long ago New Zealand reduced cases 0, opened borders, new infections. They're back square one. 

I'm saying situation people already become infected relatively safer open up. course is. I'm saying best approach protect life &amp; quality life people try avoid majority population getting infected South Korea done.

And finally, would agree two different Americas battling right now. NYC Alaska. NYC literally everywhere else country. NYC twice number active infections anywhere else country. 3 times total number infections. 3 times total number deaths. better, deserve credit post purporting about. think celebrate anywhere succeeding lowering numbers infections &amp; deaths. also think ultimately OP's post 'it's flu' crowd February.

My example Los Angeles, second largest City US right behind NYC. densest believe nearly infectious there, we're talking Anchorage. I’m third account now. fuck em lol Don’t worry. read article title pretty much assume opposite true. think God put test faith, dude - Bill Hicks topic Bruno EXACTLY. THIS.
(I got many arguments people said reopening economy would cause economic pain long run. reopen correctly shooting foot negating time spent locked down.) Bullshit. “Science” idea coronavirus. Scientific jnowledge go far. What’s point successfully avoiding virus means sacrifice economic stability? fucked either way. real problem safety net mechanism place global pandemics like one, that’s something “science” fix, ball Politics’ court.

Should political sphere listen science take science consideration making policy? Absolutely. current coronavirus disaster result anti-science bias? Absolutely not. None points ever change minds. already here. wonder ties cost u.s healthcare put reach expense. lot comes "" big pharma"" wanting money hospitals screwing Bill's things "" need"" 

 I'm Canadian culture/ news/ politics intertwined, seem less crazy science medicine bad people. also pay pocket imagine feel manipulated upvoted brave man's post mods nuke 🙄 Commercial grade TP typically store shelves, unless shopping restaurant industrial supply store like Grainger. Yes different. I'm sorry pay school flipping burgers, must rough thinking normal parents college fund you. pay college either, hopefully taught that. I'd blame you. [this site 1642 active cases yesterday 450 new ones.

there really words this.

edit: sure numbers?

Tulsa County leading way. course. Good point. thinking people choose believe COVID isn’t real refuse wear masks based personal beliefs. states need fucking stand people paid money went feds went Billionaires. CA would much better funnel money rich.  If, number new cases increases proportionally increase testing, appears case CA, implies percentage population virus flat. Flat decreasing, certainly better increasing like TX, FL, AZ.

The mask order help. Thank Newsome! DHEC SC estimating actually 143,000 cases (confirmed confirmed) - read couple days ago though I'm sure estimates increased.

I say, got tested today place went really efficient saw lot people getting tested good. testing, data. met lady taking called Covid Preventative months. Naturally skeptical. Apparently called ""NanoBio Protect"". Here's website. guess also sells Amazon.

The idea apparently swab inside nose disinfectant solution.

What guys think this? I'm convinced would work: \*even if\* nose 100% safe, could still get eyes mouth, right?

I like seem implying whatever like long stuff nose.

It's scam, right? need reported FDA something?

EDIT: Here's Amazon link.  I'm falling that, URL ends XcQ. sacrifice fully willing make No, case country made decision close borders long. country take backsies? I’ve unfriending anyone shares believes conspiracy theories actually turns believing conspiracy theories form psychosis itself. makes sense, people could go restaurant, order steak, whatever reason convinced chef trying kill poison steak actually salmon. believe despite evidence put forward! can’t anymore. understand situations like Kansas City Washington DC country right?

Where people live one state work another.

Where hospitals may one side border due tax considerations business labor.

Even NYC part tristate region. get saying, definitely needs new lockdown, perhaps targeted surgically places masks even possible. Dine restaurants, Bars, gyms. retail store fronts churches fine long masks required.

That said, faith Churches complying though. demographic inherently anti science general population. also hope smarter approach even considered. shame. trust gay jew science daddy Trump interprets bible me? thought common sense said wasn’t enough PPE beginning pandemic. wore mask even told us &amp; couldn’t necessarily social distance. I’m vulnerable, protected myself.  southern Cali Car accidents contagious. me, Socrates demonstrates communication model interrogating traditionalist authoritarians anyone making unsubstantiated assertions reality.

Same, help expect much internet people kidding. like critical thinking skills, either. untidy people like rest us, job nothing else like profession. didn’t hear guy past month sudden he’s news again? still see people standing ""masks protect wearer"" myth unironically accusing anti-science argue point. hard-headed anti-science folks be, swear even harder convince people *think* they're pro-science, yet stubbornly hold onto disproven ""facts."" There's nothing scientific blindly accepting thing read article one time cross-checking, critical thinking, even reexamining new data comes light.

Fed different states, cities counties. 

I agree you, talking two completely different bodies deal different kinds shortages right now. mean shit something like backing up. It'll something strangers argue about. Sounds like anti science problem family. distrust science much, typing smart phones invented SCIENCE MATH ENGINEERING

And driving giant F150 also created yup science math engineering.

Even fucking OLED TV watch FOX news fucking day long, invented scientists mathematicians engineers.

So trust science wanna play Nintendo? distrust either politician random basement neckbeard internet tells evil? So, god likes fucking us? nice deity, worship that

I think firm idea ""a little longer"" would end, would totally different situation. crazy upset taking precautions. young healthy person probability catching getting seriously ill covid far, far lower probability long term mental health damage strict isolation.

Amen !Remind 17 days  I’ve run coins give prizes. please accept this:

🏅🏅🏅🏅 done Northeast allies statewide mask rule effect. He's scared. find way back out, despite humiliation. get ass blown costs $50/month? Rather blame China, America would done whole lot better taking lessons China. first clear announcement made March 12, 2020. day, Anders Tegnell explained press conference Sweden entered phase two objectives guide policy actions: (i) let number severe cases exceed hospitals’ capacity offer adequate care, (ii) make sure protect vulnerable groups. 

They seemingly accomplished '(i) ' simply denying treatment likely need it. utterly failed accomplish '(ii)' reason everyone told day 1 would fail - sealing elderly everyone else going happen. would contact people would inevitably contact others actively spreading virus.

It like trying float boat full holes ocean infection. matter many holes tried plug, eventually one would missed boat would sink.

The Swedish government actively chose ignore spread deadly disease. ""strategy"" strategy all. leaves half empty hospitals,thousands deaths, ""herd immunity"" nowhere sight. eradicated SARS. case recorded since 2004. Location location. 2800 @ 1.8k/mo Correct Murphy gets shared Regional partners Cuomo Lamont. shared 7 state Coalition Baker,Wolf Carney Raimondo get message Murphy. convient think ment epicenter moved Asia Europe, US, South-America, Africa could next. Either way virus spread. reason include data places minimal mask usage good results?

Here Finland nobody wears mask outbreak less over. want die it. want bad case it, putting Pence charge several months, lose re-election. Good approach count it.

My (corrupt) contacts China already caught wind price drop SF area planning buy housing there, alternative park cash outside bedroom. Fuck it. I'm fed point.

The Mars family, know, make Snickers, Twix, Lifesavers, Wrigley chewing gum, etc. worn mask, care associate safety (well maybe little bit, call us social distance heros), said multiple times masks good benefits, even paid doctor share N95 masks work helping reduce spread, masks pointless. Even manufacturing site leaders wear masks. people stupid, selfish, close minded allowed make decisions affect many people making product several people getting sick spreading virus like cold kindergarten? even audacity share virtual messages estates thanking us continuing make money. 

Companies true colors show times like this, continue remain blatently (spelling) blind, refuse believe something works, makes want protect anymore. They're money I'm sick supporting family. worrying governor use social media remind everyone Social distancing. 7 state coalition NJ,NY,MA CT,PA,DE, &amp; RI state government officials remind everyone Social distancing. hate using word America instead US, context it’s correct. Since official name war American Civil War. expertise field. courage really impressed He's germaphobe. bet cancels rally.

And bet connives way getting vaccine first, maybe trading aircraft carrier China F35s India. massive country. state would probably swallow country.
And live safe exceptionally beautiful. I've many places around EU never visit places like Paris London again.
So quit bashing US. I’d argue “freedom” “protests” aren’t innately here.

In case - “freedom” = “right” drink local bar while, “protest” = fighting hundreds years broken system arguably still harming people. way Target employees supported previous raise? Target problem.  government reason localities states absolutely set higher minimum wage address things like different costs living. kiwi?   accidentally read article. Townhall thinks lockdowns, small businesses would fine.

In reality, people staying home safety, Big Brother shut restsurants. Report OSHA. infectious disease doctor got anything blm antifa rioters? Unfortunately, way make happen forcing legally people selfish, entitled assholes. *could*? already has. Federally, haven’t locked lmao Yeah, forget explanation, even without numbers, tell things improving massively. We're even allowing tourist back country now. Hopefully, prove mistake. seen contagion epidemiologist that's source information, rather pop culture. start company employs thousands workers pay arbitrary amount per hour think ""acceptable"". excuses.

Hopefully, Trump shakes lots hands, poses lots pictures, takes lots deep relaxing breaths fresh air. ACRE?! literally forgotten houses come land too. 

Living city sucks. It’s saying don’t catch twice... shedding dead virus first infection. part G20 initiative Prediction. Trump suggested enough times “no masks” (see NFL) people attending wearing them. know, easy prediction let’s see... government for.  People need stop demanding individual companies deal massive fundamental infrastructure issues zero power change even responsible first place. Almost everything retail workers complaining Bernie Sanders would addressed instead retail workers flocking support nothing attack character went back whining ignorantly employer fix every single one issues.  Ireland would go polls also NI wanted rejoin. straight forward think  seems way sadly. still baffles contagious disease is.

Really? thought everyone knew now. Okay, obviously WRITE CAN'T READ. mean malice (probably long word - ask Mom look you) statement above. hope could prevent getting sick wearing face mask social distancing others...

Should take streets protest wear face masks social distance???

Hopefully, death vain. Wear mask. Social distance. Stay safe. Come Gavin right thing! live OC board supervisors forced awesome public health director rescinded mask order. Someone outside OC needs force mask order upon OC. remove San Marino Andorra populations 33k 77k, Sweden would number 5 death per capita list entire world. Really? see quite lot around area. (I live Laguna Beach around area well).  
I say people def losing masks though. usage dropping still 40% rate city. landlady increased rent 200 dollars annual lease resets next month, feels ridiculous context. Target last times raised starting pay Walmart many retailers.  PR stunt. businesses work.  asking company ever going give you.  issues like need addressed federal level. current strategy country f***cked royally begin with. YES PLEASE Why? job got injured paid well, suck soul body, overall good place work at. Unfortunately, injuries happen, actively going OSHA requirements.

Target, hand, give flying fuck OSHA. trucks stacked ceiling, jump reach top one catch it, hoping whole thing come crashing down. twist body put rack, every safety video existence says ""Don't fucking that.""

An entire truck unloaded way 30 minutes, they're constantly pushing faster fucks given injured. fact, ones almost 4 hour schedule order to: 

a) Keep employees part time benefits

and

b) help keep injuries down

The job got injured regularly 12-18 hour shifts. Injuries happened, often. Safety important. job physically demanding. People oil fields said tougher turnover rate high it.

Target gives fucks safety. pay minimum wage expect work break neck pace every minute on. supervisor says ""Go break"" start timer. law, least am, breaks uninterrupted 10 minutes.

In Target's eyes, time takes get break room come back break time. law says work way, employees little power anything it.

I could go differences jobs I've held, comment long enough. said stands.. Working Target far worse job I've ever had. 

That includes military, 3 month stint working 36 hours on, 12 hours everyday breaks.. developed stomach ulcers.

That includes Fastrip, regularly jobs three people. got run car way work still came in, despite odds boss dipshit.

And yeah, even includes job got injured fucked worker's comp, leading becoming homeless living car couple years. Eventually broke lived tent streets.

In fact, I'm still position. can't find work persisting injury virus closing things down.

And yet.. Target still far worst place ever worked for. Seeing eyes fellow coworkers.. life joy them, reason enough conclude that.

Fuck Target. child abuse violence homes link criminality. children grow conditions commit crimes. do, many experienced abuse violence home children don’t commit crime.

Off top head, best monitor symptoms wait results.

Hint, new midsummer happened yet. Interesting low antibody count taken randomly. another nail coffin herd immunity. Seems unachievable, is; price reach much high death count.

With steady slow death count ICU beds taken, one see end Sweden late summer. personal belief return fall though...and Sweden worse hit countries wave hits. (My reasonsing «embers» start new fire) guess daily death count low, find something else negative instead. Yeah, hurts everyone, even economy lot imo Yeah. valid countries like Liechtenstein, San Marino Seychelles small population. Neither. Abott overruled local authorities enforcing people wear masks spike new cases united states despite mass protesting two weeks ago? make since Including said.




(and also said)




(and anything anyone else might add, forever more) relying China numbers like relying numbers coming GA, FL, TX comes reporting obfuscation death rates? Boston aggressively trying test protestors haven’t seen spikes yet. Obviously YMMV choose ignore it. problem strategy Covid ignore them. Face shields provide splash protection eyes, complete protection close quarters extended periods time, also effective blocking transmission wearer. Medical personnel country wear masks face shields. always hated machines, gives issues every time. Bring back cashiers! spouse controlling part ""PC agenda."" Sounds like part problem. 1500 people died VA system. think like rest country, response piecemeal rather uniform. understand difference reporting facts reporting someone claiming you? complicated. Probably couple times actual cases then. Certainly good time celebrate graduation. Thankfully, even Sweden celebrating small groups.  Well virus ain't over. measure success alive, that's shitty measure.

For country. 

Unless mean alive speak CCP. way relevant said? Saw couple TV there's stuff like too: TT, hand, Jonas Hansson, assistant infection prevention physician Norrbotten Region, says spread infection Gällivare described uncontrolled:

- spread society. see become seriously ill end hospital, ended intensive care. call spread infection uncontrolled, know mean, expression someone used, T-model steroids, indeed next generation Michael Jordan. SARs really close, considered eradicated. [9 popped since 2003 outbreak. told protest going cause chaos spikes. 🤔 Funny people use per capita numbers Sweden. countries like Brazil, UK US always use raw numbers. say due uptick cases. hospital half mile home (Palm Beach West) article says used 100% ICU beds. vaccine “If wear mask can’t play fortnite later” agree Mask wearing mandatory enter store, disagree risk assessment. 

The cashier single point close contact hundreds people merchandise, per day. definition potential super-spreaders. hope talk they're ok can't. can. honestly think waited July instead rushing like competitors realized would expensive open soon wanted watch June. wouldn’t surprised rethink it. They’re still taking new reservations. Oh ok haha didnt read article either saw news announcement donation happened It’s almost covid whether adobe truly used arizona florida completely irrelevant. 

the point *indoors* causes spread virus, air conditioning. I'm interested conclusion anything that. Personal freedoms include lots things.... include shopping without shirt shoes... include right wear mask.

Locking totally different conversation. Closing business different conversation. 

If want us like Europe social services like do. can't ways.  Corona Virus: like this! Gas Station stop every morning even employees wearing mask. We’re green county. Central PA could give fucks.

It actually doesn't, right now. antibody testing numbers held surprisingly steady now, around 21%. means amount people antibodies increased much, cases increased dangerous level, also means people contagious anymore (presumably). 21% pretty much 21% month ago.

They rated claim false deaths Florida year compared recent years, tweet ignores CDC’s provisional data year counts deaths caused pneumonia COVID-19. said, Dr. Anthony Fauci, government's leading infectious-disease specialist, medical experts said government’s COVID-19 death toll undercount. 

and 2020 data released next year list one underlying cause death.

So basically, might least partly true, know next year. America dies stupid hills  Could imagine much worse shortages would public told wear masks?

Well, eventually landed ""any sort mask covers nose mouth helps lot"" could homemade. Even bandana face beneficial. applying many partially-mitigating factors can.

I wish early they'd said ""face coverings help slow transmission please wear one, make one home leave medical masks frontline workers"" similar. Hell, tie spare t-shirt around face. Anything.

It easy apply hindsight criticizing others, case think fair. mean, pandemic plans place epidemiologists able articulate this. know depends person. There's also different levels contagious are. contagious instantly even next day unlikely, within 2-5 days likely median time symptoms appearing day 5. would like Stephen Fry. would characterize “Well, told something untrue afraid told truth, would something didn’t want do?”

Because that’s happened here; new discovery masks reduce spread disease. It’s country _values_ money life. It’s simple mathematics. Developing county like India cannot sustain prolonged economic lockdown it’ll go recession (highly likely go even now). 

The population 1.4 billion people. That’s waaay much control given pop density. country like India goes economic free fall recovering would take decades. That’s economy open developing nations population easier bring back economy (I know it’s sad dark true..) Stupidity something Americas right-wing fully embraces oh ok.

Huh, communal organization could somehow come rules follow. Maybe call organization state government rules laws? old people could ask leader ""government,"" let's call leader governor, ask law would protect dying?

Alas, government, governor, laws figments imagination, something people Texas could use protect them. Yep, feel like beach destinations hot spot people escaping heat humidity inside air conditioned bars restaurants, actual beach. 4k cases California yesterday. :D Number one, whoo.

The masks supposed realm 100% effective. Cloth masks literally let unfiltered air escape. whole point reduce effective range virus slowing air nose mouth.

By enforcing policy valves (things make easier breathe), going less effective making things difficult.

Some dolts going weed simple attrition thanks Covid 19. Killing cultist base sure strange way prove care them. True, testing really ramped up. every country lot mild asymptomatic cases -- powerful testing regimen catching those, especially many employers requiring negative tests go back work single employee tests positive. places, people tested identified, infection clinically insignificant (i.e. symptoms common cold-like symptoms). AZ currently 1 every 175 people tested positive covid-19. see reason slow next week. Especially today governor passing buck masks local cities.

*Sigh*

It's bad here, nobody's taking seriously work place sends meds dying people. see covid-19 positive way fucking often I'm job. Oh leave be. Anyone stupid enough listen guy gonna get fleeced someone else. /s talking thing except one watched contagion. growth rate actually takes less steps forecast expected number cases might days. R score whatever, need factor average lifespan virus unaccounted for.

There also factors reaction public announcements necessary logistics get fed (in NYC many people need take subway get paycheck/food) Pretty bad Sign statutory declaration post Reddit karma matter lose race? Fuck, keeps up, Arizona going start turn people away. going see refridgrated trucks, indoor areas converted field hospitals soon states like Arizona, Texas, Flordia? God subreddit sick head.

Well it’s anything like facemasks they’ve selling... fascinating, weird, stressful period last 50 years. need start cruises! Stupid comes pairs! Give proof lockdowns keeping cases going up, please. else anyone expect? giant check really needed $1,000? ya winning son? Funny thing everyone Hong Kong wears masks protesting daily China hundreds thousands entire Covid-19 pandemic far, there's 4 Covid deaths city 7.5 million. name dashboard, able link it. examples Quest antibody test false negative result? believe infected late January -- experienced quite moderate disease high fever, sore throat, awful cough, likely mild pneumonia (bloody phlegm) -- got Quest antibody test April 29th, result negative.

Is possible antibody test late infected? surprising given [Mark Cuban's ""secret shoppers"" found Dallas businesses' safety protocols Thoughts prayers, guess. Surprise! read u/raziel2p comment quickly. right assume countries (other NZ) immense pressure allow tourism despite ridiculous risks impose citizens.

Italy one, need find way shelter elderly exposed yet risk second wave deadly first one. is, open tourism lax quarantine rules. Simple solutions: commercials/advertisements/reports/print-outs properly wear care mask... hard publish bullet-point list cartoon infograph references stating info came getting spread masses. people mess anyway? Duh. Humans dumb forgetful learning something new. we're still reducing risk transmission overall based people right good enough. 


Wrong solution: Tell people masks dangerous *certain* *circumstances*, even wear one unless symptomatic, already early proven asymptomatic pre-symptomatic people spread virus like wildfire. Besides physical barrier masks also provide constant visible reminder counteract normalcy bias. believe counteraction people masks want experience normalcy bias psychologically/emotionally comfortable.

I would imagine normalcy bias effects mitigating factors including hand washing social distancing. would render widespread mask use absolutely critical mitigation.  Nobody knows anything future certain, think odds pretty good impact mild case impact common cold. 

My son one first confirmed cases state. got friend returned ski trip Italy. day one ""illness"" sore throat. night night sweats. morning day two said ""scratchy' throat. afternoon day two fine. mid March.

I picked football practice today. He's running ass practice week, he's completely fine, months. Glad hear Ohio seems ready second wave, states like Arizona sure seem trouble right now, hear. Totally. Viruses thrive inside human body, heat controlled unit part. It’s called homeostasis. would anyone think cares season is? case since ever rent takes arm leg? drastic increase rent/property prices recent phenomenon? prices live increased 50% even 100% compared 5/6 years ago. idea happen struggle make ends meet. living city seems impossible anyone trying come live unless great job. Spain 5% awhile ago news?  evil kind excited? i’m hoping many pandemic deniers end catching turn completely swaying public opinion taking much seriously surprised well 180 started pushes vitamins cure covid fucking turned moron forgot scientists show said True, think Dallas, Montgomery, Pheanox, Houston, Charleston overrun mass infections, hospitals ICU beds, forced turn people away. remember happened New York City March April, see even bigger scale, worst thing happen. Daily deaths steadily going since mid April, albeit slowly. peaking ~100/day currently around 40. Good graph showing daily deaths respect delay reporting, using official data: Dude. guys double population Hong Kong country size 40 times bigger. live clusterfuck like manhattan, much closer ground zero do, still managed get 150 cases/1m pop. guys get around 2.8k/1m pop.

How guys get many cases do? Ohh maybe virus says ""oh hate stay away Asians"" ? lease end July gotten renewal. moving anyways matter past 2 years I've gotten renewal notice months ahead time. *they* infect worrisome.

im particularly anxious nervous 40 year olds ending hospitals great numbers. I’m worried Tulsa come Jacksonville, STILL won’t learned. Jax FUUCKED Ah, misunderstood then.

so basically retail jobs? Britain, many deaths. way care homes treated Pandemic diagracful something never forget. probably completely fine, right? Arizona 83% ICU bed capacity. rate, AZ hospitals overwhelmed sometime next week. could meet positive? Rents drop even virus disappears. people realizing achieve amount work work-from-home even live ever want, including lower COL areas. That's good, except cat likes sit *other* window!

Back work least 2021, maybe massively reduced capacity, regardless when. 

My house probably jumped 100k value based fact huge number NYC residents boat me. 

Cities know - retail, office buildings, insane prices tiny apartments - going need drastically rethink concepts. 

Just wait massive real estate investment companies ton NYC buildings SF buildings, charge inflated rents start going bankrupt asking covid bailout. 

They ruined cities, they’re going ask money it. Especially never really high numbers anyway 😂😂 Cases skyrocketed tomorrow 1 million 1.5 million early July.

Totally ass fucking bullshit Brazil overtake US number COVID-19 cases worst affected country, Amazon rainforest rapidly infected. Remember couple weeks calm everyone kept saying two weeks sarcastically. Spread exponential. takes time show cases hospitalizations explodes. clearly everyone worried right. So, glad fears confirmed get stay home 2021 country leadership awful words. Fair Surprise! 
That’s town mayor of... side note think companies donated drug stockpile. Hardly getting rich that. 

Really? Wow. wonder Mr. Trump said then, ""I bought millions doses (of hydroxychloroquine). 29 million. spoke Prime Minister Modi, lot (hydroxychloroquine) comes India. asked would release it? great. really good.” Sean Hannity Fox News. Im relocating LA NYC. Anyone LA know good pandemic pricing two bedroom around los Feliz Alhambra? dream living wooded area. SoCal city suburb city know gross refers to? That'd taxes withholding.

So 15 dollars * 40 hours * 50 weeks (subtract 2 weeks unpaid time per year) = $30,000.

Most time gross hourly full-time wage * 2000 simplified version above. Meh, pay $1500 LA homeless! Like maybe 5 6 days dude cost blood test 25 50 euros. general cheaper swab. addition get information cannot swab (if person probably covid already).

My understanding save swabs cases likely positive.

In region (not lombardy) performed 7100 swab tests last 2 days found... 5 positives! Population 3.7 millions. quite hard understand look new cases. Everything put right direction good thing. contact tracing app, mass blood testing etc.

In region took two important decisions around mid april. still 250 cases day decided freely distribute 10 million masks 2 weeks door door. immediately passed local law making masks mandatory law like national level (they kept distributing masks.. got almost 90million masks 3.7 million population!!!).
The second thing start blood tests medical staff nursing homes quick way assess situation stop every possible outbreaks. got 60k blood tests quickly identified small outbreaks nursing homes found 4% medical staff positive. stop went testing workers contact public lockdown. mid may performed 205k blood tests. continued soon many companies reopened pushed get employees blood tested (it voluntary). plan end june performed total 400k blood tests (in addition 350k swab tests).

This sometimes people drive crazy.
When locked region 400 ICU beds covid potential 650. say potential 300 occupied peak 14 are.. many covid areas closed sanitized. ready reopen necessary.
At beginning impossible get masks shortage. given 25 masks free want prices fixed: 50 cents each. plenty supermarkets pharmacies.
Daily testing day lockdown around 500 tests. went 6000 day around peak, today performed 4200 find 2 positives.
Contact tracing app released 10 days ago test 4 regions enabled countrywide monday. 3 million downloads whole country already alerted people close contacts positives (they get swab test).
Blood tests.. told work.
Isolation? 444 active cases 4000 isolation, 399 positives even need hospitalization isolated home.

And lockdown?

Parks visits family members allowed since may 4th. Bars restaurants reopened may 18th. Gyms reopened may 25th. Starting june 3rd movements regions free (including lombardy). EU travel resumed monday.
Everywhere go see people masks, respecting social distancing, using hand sanitizers on.

And read people saying countries ""follow sweden"" ""talk little action"" ""lockdowns work"". mighty good work there. legit Chanel garment bag. That's hard one lol many die? 1 ...0? Fuck Florida. Poe's Law strikes think it’s reporting recoveries kinda pointless given people recover home without ever seeing doctor, test positive never bother following get confirmed recovery. anything might create negative public view virus limited reporting would make death rate seem higher. point I'm embarrassed people decided make political. Good point. different people ordering take-out last 3 months? think there's evidence infected cooks coughing food major (or even minor) vector transmission. people selfish wear masks US good common folk want us selfLESS enough go get case virus, good business interests investments. rent went up.

What's exemptions, typically needs meet criteria exempt (even 15 years old):

2) owned person corporation/LLC

Duplexes owner lives one units also exempt.

So, single family home, owned corporation, need abide rent control law. I'm sure they'll find use it, even effective. According Chinese State controlled media is. Lol social media spreading conspiracy theories.

""Well that's matter semantics"" I’ve got friend owns house older couple rented years. visited place couple years moved (the house UK, he’s US) they’d looked place well even made improvements actually dropped rent, hasn’t touched since. reasoning fixed rate mortgage it, long costs covered, wants build equity doesn’t care rental yield all. landlord tenant dynamic seems always adversarial find good tenant, makes sense keep long run. really burned NY though. Latest statewide antibody testing (concluded June 13) shows 21% NYC, 14% Long Island 10% Hudson Valley antibodies. areas state 1.5 5.5% range. We're able open NY herd immunity. herd immunity. governor shut state point Manhattan streets ghost towns, mandated mask usage, ramped testing contact tracing, emphasized social contract philosophy obligation protect people around us. least far evident upstate city, mask wearing social distancing norm rather exception, populace listened. he's inching state open, far working.

Inflation keeps people saving money relying aid. literally punishes people saving own. single country managed spare nursing home population letting spread amongst young people

No America bad account population density states. Texas 5 6 times population states, means likely come contact heck lot people, including individual infected refuses wear mask. population alone, odds much slimmer two states mention. get virus accidentally sharing someone else's glass/drink (i.e. picking wrong cup bottle drinking)? 

My understanding can't get virus via food/drink, answer likely no, I'm curious. Dr Fauci? And... everyone else? counterfeits, unless brands actually selling masks look like this, doubt. basic case trademark infringement. blind asshole? It’s literally everywhere would funnier tax money didn’t pay it. place looked market within days.

We seeing something like Omaha right now. agent said usually got above-asking-price offer within couple days house going sale, several cases they've sold 12 hours.  grand scheme things will. Within 1-2 years either vaccine, treatment, herd immunity. posts move again.

You grasping straws.  believe fairly uncommon. You’d think would great solution they’ll probably pollute waterway it. sounds like mental gymnastics hey suppose.  Conclusion: IQ 30 000/(200*3)=50. Coincidence? think not...   county? assure Bay Area. sad article. think scarier part willful lack testing, population’s mistrust government, noncompliance basic prevention measures, denial disease serious even real.

A consistent pattern pandemic places populations think virus hoax like flu, ironically, end highest death tolls. often due either mistrust government leading people questioning warnings given bad information coming leaders like Trump Bolsonaro health officials like ones Sweden UK. 

It take transmission develop crisis situation, I’m worried month we’ll hear massive, unexplained mortality parts Haiti without tests confirm it’s related COVID-19 like happened Guayaquil, Ecuador recently Aden, Yemen. places similarly Haiti young population, suffered poverty limited healthcare. sure tell family's covid victims. shoulda punched window ala Indian Jones.

I'm LA paid 1400 room lived 3 people. tests produce false positives half time. Edit: assuming 1% prevalence. lockdown keep flu deaths low. closed businesses kept folks home still bad. seem much worse flu? guy forbid business state making masks mandatory. real answer. 30k year enough West Virginia maybe home, probably decent car, probably saving money retirement-especially married someone making similar.

""But rather states currently worse wont grow anywhere near exponential rate NY/NJ etc.. back March original comment seemed imply.""

In head still replying top comment user implied exponential growth rate NY back march could extrapolated TX, FL, etc... disagreed. notice replying different person bad.

Thank effort address ""I really understand argument making, testing impact spread disease"":

In context hard hit states back march, argument current testing count positive rate 4-10% TX, FL, etc... today paints much clearer picture infection severity back march NY NJ (with 40-60% positive rate). Therefore steep exponential growth happened due testing capability back likely see nearly steep trend happen now.

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly actually addressing post:

""

What argument (which could incorrect about) seem address growth changed one way testing. disease grows logistically, roughly modeled following formula

N(d+1) = N(d) \* (1 + E + R0)

Where

N(d+1) number cases tomorrow

N(d) number cases today

E Average number people someone infected exposed day

R0 Base Reproduction Factor, probability exposure becomes infection.

""

Yes argument never made address current situation, top level comment's extrapolation.

I familiar R0 brief wiki search led rough general definition ""expected number cases directly generated one case population individuals susceptible infection"". makes feel "" E + R0 "" rough eq little wonky since R0 seems mix infection probability exposure time.

Amazed push-back masks, evidence countries states prove beyond doubt MASKS WORK reduce spread. Period. strategic advantage population wear masks. think vast majority states declining new infection rates reopening began. continued, contact tracing would possible.  

Similarly, we’re still trouble acquiring enough PPE hospitals. 

We definitely opened early wasted significant gains. get mask right sign waiver liability bet screeching throwing masks air 'librarians.' (Don't wanna get knicked wicked automod.) Intelligence hails every corner globe, locations reputation reason sell short. 

Thank expanding vocabulary! I'd bet Gates foundation probably lot too. sad thing is, they'd actually cared health people, could tested mothers living areas lot infections told they're given test case, safety child, they're limiting contact results come in. mention since skin-to-skin contact specifically recommended newborns, separating children mothers might even harmful. opening borders vaccine? Money thing motivates politics Spain lol. They've long forgotten democracy, general population who's left fighting 'right left' they're buddy-buddies behind everyone's backs. It’s horse manure landlords.

As result military service handful rentals arcoss country I’ve kept I’ve moved place place.

No way hell ever renting civilian ever again.

I’m chill dropping rent market, raise rent market, I’d probably exchange rent labor months unemployed tenants, forced provide good repayment?

Yeah I’m risking that. pandemic implement procedures costly forces people things really won’t help stop spreading. 

It help determine PCR negative 0-7 days ago test say nothing person contagious departure. temperature scan catch much contagious people 0-7 days old test. 

A person 7 days old **positive** test *might* back normal status again. hospital view normal people onset symptoms 7 days ago fever last 48 hours (verified) person without risk spreading. Masks definetly helps, make virus proof  America unraveling seams. pentagon budget needs immediately diverted reconstruction survival republic. neglected country vulnerable far long. time seize day perish. 😂 think trolling posts, right? people 35, well people 35. 35, thing scares shit me. Please lump everyone group year born in. June police violence protests, gotta wait july supervolcano. implying that? I’m asking jerk, stop grasping straws. way think dude clean mess himself? Likely not, instead person get hired scrub egg wall. evidence mounting. worry, figure out.  think underestimate stubbornness older people. give fucks virus whatever please. happened whole Trump ""when see outbreaks snuff out""?

That back day, Covid new interesting. old hat. evidence mounting. worry, figure out.  Absolutely like everywhere else That's way detecting opposition.  first line bill gates sponsored vaccine.

Haha guy thinks vaccine given regular people like me. haven’t realized first available vaccines wealthy people first rest us get nothing. read another article may caused micro-clotting brain. There's usually one register open see point annual San Diego conference canceled year. I'm missing beach week much. Oh well, maybe next year. Yeah LA complete shithole. take surf trips Cal time. San Diego great, LA whole story. don’t get either man. Believe want. swinging rapidly 2016, too. think ppl gonna forget dems supported towns cities burned looted Im sorry. imagine lot dems looking job. one, repeat, one, wants town burned looted- matter say. ppl lie pollsters time. fact, purpose give false sense security. think Trump voters waited last day vote? bc wanted stand line hours. Wat I’m flying EU US... prepare besides masks disinfectants? Anything wear that’ll help? Lining carry-on plastic bags? tips would help!! Intelligence agreed, shelter home get without even exposed directly again? thanks. incorrect. rest Scandinavia fared somewhat better - much better. 

As Sweden, demographic distribution fatalities similar comparing Sweden Nordic countries - total Swedish tally simply higher. excess mortality among elderly, similar excess mortality among age groups. 


Take look mortality figures at: Note scary Swedish excess mortality among children. sad say this, they've failed miserably. 


Sweden right idea along. were, are, stubbornly attached influenza-fixated strategy (it would've good strategy transmission patterns similar flu).  


Also note Sweden actually starting enact harsher local lockdown measures. one mining town, trains busses suspended avoid spread nearby regions. Mines shut workers sent home. Public institutions closed. think there's way people going agree second lockdown, going let spread countries regardless dead sick. already see country cases rise threaten close instead open more. I'm fully convinced decided let spread uncontrollably economy collapse.

I think countries heading way, countries actually delayed lockdown better might gotten enough immunity prevent second wave. Outside dining fine. 

The inside problem, mate. FDA revoked based studies like one Lancet 2 weeks laters revoked fraudulent data. well informed. FDA source ill informed. informing HCQ supposed work actually read supposed scientifically articles come conclusion trials made way HCQ option fail ? 

I dont care whether HCQ cure not. care know whether works not. dont like FDA revokes HCQ based fraudulent study like one Lancet. needed randomized trial early covid patients. study like get done. studies randomized EARLY patients garbage. already known 6 months ago HCQ would probably work giving early. FDA refusing study time gave green light die Remdesivir basically 0 benefit covid patients ? National disgrace said lot things right Um yeahhhhhh. don’t think understand process publishing scientific article ok. Some, like SC, never hard shutdown

FTFY? heart goes two young adults, losing adults family one blow also losing housing? hope lung transplant comes mother recovers soon. live them? Household transmission studies shown low transmission rates.  live Roanoke, Judging amount people still wearing masks stores like TJ Max opening back up, looking good.  strange numbers dropping mysterious ""cure"" sudden. I'm buying it. Garuda great reputation safety, story something else hahaha It’s okay skeptical. much information fed since beginning lies. masks effective, risk low, it’s air. understand why. see us bunch idiots cause great panic. able see happening around world come conclusions. choose cautious families health actual proof immunity, proper treatment, vaccine. proof government lied start. keep believing spoon feed us foolish point. Always ask why? would motive. usually comes money economy health people. ""While smoking cigar American flag behind you""

His line was, ""It's like rollerblading, someone made one homophobic joke sudden everybody stopped it."" says close quarter contact might increase risk getting COVID. prove indoor transmission possible outdoor transmission? sure you’re trying say here. No. needed Donald trump tell us this. people, there's 2 ways they're going learn: Trump tells them, one one someone immediate family die (then they'll saying ""nobody told dangerous"") bleach limo.. good. fool say? example, tenant lived unit 30 years, drives new Cadillac buys trades roughly every three years, makes working DoD do. think guy couldn’t buy house wanted one?

There tons people don’t want own. You’re conceited believe everyone motivation do. everyone would wear mask properly could work safely remember right airline sister flew years ago. fly low one door close properly tied stay closed kind seatbelt freight thing. get rid restrictions already? closed borders now. That's nine days. people would start showing symptoms then, need get tested wait results. uptick triggered something protests. memorial day weekend too? That's amazing thing. People talked much would willing die country even willing sit basement month watching free pornhub premium. wealthy people countries vacationing NZ,. escape covid19? yes, possibility may bringing them? math troll mayor rode decision.

Thankfully. Well, don’t enough PPE curve bending back up, neither.  


We started flatten curve threw massive party without masks social distancing celebrate. we’ve wasted months lockdown we’re worse place lockdown started. That's imported case. quarantine. Finally signs “working things right. Polls sometimes wrong anything could happen November. generally speaking, claim ""the protests going make people vote specific candidate"" believable polls swinging rapidly away candidate. Good luck Biden. Btw, 40 decades+ DC, done poor black families? one reason Trump bc rioters looters allowed destroy cities towns. guess would bet many citizens voted Hillary bc that. Ppl want law order. went doctor weeks ago. woman who's job stop people door wearing mask. later asked got snarky sad near anyone. customer came ask someone get one back. even mask om her. Yep.. masks help.  

 folks. interesting headline I've read awhile market efficient sometimes claimed, actually contingent people want property without needing deal problems come home ownership terms repairs, maintenance, etc - I'm sure we'd see ""concierge"" type services would gladly take fee handle administration

Literally called owning condo. yes, people time. Covidiot people expect? We’re pandemic F sakes. It’s amazing people can’t stay home sequester themselves. little rally NOTHING. intelligence level people staggering. La bon bonar money drug. billions doses already hand, one manufacturer outright donated hundreds millions stockpile March.

MD everyone wearing cases keep going down. It’s hard. Wear mask. we? Mr. Hard Hitting Comments acting like it’s wrong people cautious that’s acting like babies?  would be. conspiracy theories? There’d roving militias staking federal buildings hunting deep state conspirators. 

It’s scary really. like side voters anyway. What's stupid massive protests insist part of. feel like would’ve gotten somehow true. Maybe asymptomatic mild case would gotten think.

Maybe really think nbd. can’t imagine doctors encouraging this, also can’t stop Okay gotcha. can’t tell who’s serious say that. can’t figure out! doesn’t make sense. 

He looks like entitled asshole. grin reminds Orange Julius. Went car ride LA Manhattan Beach. many people without mask. Huddled together waiting cross street walking narrow sidewalks. poetic sounds, it’s *will* catch become ill even show symptoms—and go see grandmother wasn’t dumb enough attend. 

That’s problem. 

I’d love idiots able expose pay consequences.

But, sadly, doesn’t work way. fact, quite opposite—and lots folk taking precautions pay price. It’s terrible, really. Joe Arpaio human garbage Many labs around world working prove debunk it. Many countries including UK Australia officially announced clinically trialing it. lease expired May 31st, give notice March 31st. Rent going $100, decided renew take chances rents decreasing. perfect timing.

Low maintenance. cleaning lady. place lived housed baseball team every spring/summer, didn’t show year due Covid. America really wear mask pandemic around 750,000 Glendale (Los Angeles county) unwell? it’s proving point solid joke. Well done. imagine said said wear mask. we'd trump-branded masks sold cult $30 each, lot fewer deaths. someone who's supposedly great self-promotion marketing, really missed boat one. moron chief Joe Arpaio Cases/day doubled 10 days.  continues small numbers become large quick. That's exponents work. Comparing numbers New York's today irrelevant. seem think can't happen. sure I'd call webmd reliable source. think it’s pretty obvious would rather discussing    probably got mild case asymptomatic believes immune, would explain normally germophobic self acts like care. China almost unemployment. pay people bullshit jobs, like groups people trimming grass hand. this, get minimum wage low 1400 rmb ($200) per month. reference, housing costs sometimes low 700 rmb per month 1 bedroom. Best luck that. Please stay hell away innocent people self isolate 2 weeks rally infect innocent people want part shit Except looted — inside. imagine? Trump's supporters die droves due virus? LOL!

These big differences dude. trying hard defend recast political bias here. 

This pandemic isn’t political.  hate obligated share things others ... keep back pocket needed. saying worth frontline employee, $200 *plus* increase hourly wage throughout year (from $13 $15/hr). annualizes $4,000 assuming 40 hrs/wk. That's lot people acknowledging. Bless heart  *my* money need guy sheriff 60 Days In.

Man need doctor tell us this. I've saying weeks, today math surprised quick Texas (or state matter) could catch even New York's deaths/milion.

By calculation would take 45 days day daily deaths increased 10%, *at point they'd roughly 40k deaths*. used 10% increase roughly increase New York saw ramp peak (though maintain 45 days).

I know, maybe math wrong use spreadsheet can't see error one. believe it. sobering/frightening. joke!

Parents students better get contract change thousands hundred thousands, would fit US. still meaningless gesture beyond week. $1000 instead. think article makes one mistake end: says ""Millions Americans found unemployed result pandemic."" think entirely correct. countries managed find way give people income even unable work due lockdown. fact case US means unemployment result unstable economy, rather pandemic itself. I'm kinda glad greedy circle jerk colleges worry this.
Just think many students would benefit pay room board. Kind wishing virus killed quickly could eliminate fucktards stagnating economy extending virus precautions. countries law worn public inside public places. f**k isn’t law states. simple act save thousands lives. bizarre. fucking scared beginning - pandemic actually bad World War Z fantasy, he's like, ""Masks pussies.""

It's weird watch turn people accused - low information highly partisan. thought accusations truly wrongheaded - maybe one wrong. places draconian lockdowns 95% + mask wearing indeed able suppress disease.  also accidentally cut flu cases 90% season.

Why using roads? Roads oppressive tool goverment, subjegate being, follow specific preselected path! Next time go road, assert dominance show freedom whatever want.

Wearing clothes also oppressive. public, take pants shit floor one tell can't do.

If everything above, case understand wearing mask must difficult task goes idea total individual freedom aka selfish asshole disregard anything anyone you.

But choosing wear mask brainwashed thinking right biggest symbol oppression tyranical goverment impose you, time follow rules imposed society goverment, either hypocrite obtuse. drive beach go home.

My dentist sent excellent mailer telling everyone precautions taking, include UV sanitation, radical change use equipment aerosolize saliva, hand scraping back instead new tech... etc.

I think business taking precautions avoided, specific activities really safe right now, includes cardio indoors near others (since likely breath deeply prolonged period time others putting out...) restaurant church gathering without adequate social distancing masks. 

Everyone needs serious evaluate rush normal safe themselves, others, since even brush COVID-19 mean others infect lucky. Can't hospitals, know, tell people fuck we're full?

Non native speaker. word comes regular conversation. dentist hand does. think 35 young. think heard going offer masks rally. bet white woman give right call poc like that. yes, mean hate type white woman. certainly. problem lot ""Karens"" lib dems like it. think stupid figure ""white"" ppl get label? helps governor doctor believes science :) Dave Barry wrote funny article too, I'm sleep deprived try &amp; find  many doomers here...exceptions make rule.

Most people including mild cases develop antibodies fight infection issues - also piling evidence cell immunity cross-immunity prompted common cold viruses. 

A minority suffer longer term symtomps something already know previous diseases. Residuals viruses persist long time hence chronic fatigue resurgence symptomps occur individuals struggle clear virus. 

This reinfection. Stop scaremongering. also many comments sepsis, Kawasaki, strokes heart attacks know RARE isolated individual cases get media attention. 

I sorry suffered disease also owe others stop scaring people mental health issues Yup, we’re outraged /r/Florida 

I’m cancelling gym membership today it. went Monday roughly ~50ppl 10pm ~50, *the one* wearing mask.

I think me. Everyone fucking moron. Rent bills area you’re lucky $1k left. 

Now somebody chimes live $200 little town butt fuck nowhere, know it’s cheap. I’m living Deliverance land again. arrested. caused mass panic undoubtedly led many many people infected.

I'm humorous, informed. Less spending Medicaid. Win/win! like Wal-Mart still convenient though even afford go stores Curious know Massachusetts lot of/most people wearing masks? live there? I'm equally liberal Michigan, almost NO-ONE wears masks here. Trump actively trying achieve China-like situation. sure lost you. agree. moved city years ago wanted enjoy city life. kind suck everything closed, reopened, closing again, going last forever. may take year shit gets back new normal, cities going away. cases covid19 person travelled bus apparently nobody bus infected. far read cases infected commute country. Good luck. Even liberal judge would toss order unreasonable infringement rights populace.

Yes, wear mask realize mandate would never stand court law anything milli-second.

That reason Hogan removed mask mandate allowed businesses mandate like ""No shirt, shoes, service!"" ""Low key... Lex Luthor"", made day.  Yeah I'm sure otherwise spend 3 years college reading masks work 200 halls 10,000 beds.  Cause it’s getting started reopening fast. inconsistent, protests capital sold “selfish people put everyone risk” outside, wearing masks completely peaceful. Yet attacked literal looting rioting weren’t. venue, I’m sure outdoor site probably ideal, I’m sure it’s something security potus something like that? think people deserve choice situation. want go, go. I'm starting wonder side effect medication FDA yet disclosed.

/s  I'm presently arguing person sub, right now, believes evidence lockdowns effective, belief lockdowns akin belief magic piranha eats pieces moon instead moon cycle. 

The people believe anti-intellectuals running right wing USA. haven’t started phase two yet. starts 22nd. CA wearing masks numbers rising too

 Idiots dying. Idiots think hoax think wearing mask infringes phantom ""right."" worked Costco, much better company, got raises every 6 months. small raises substantial raises. first year target, first raise .15 cents. That's pathetic. 

Costco also profit shares, allowing employees buy stock company, receive dividends. used get quarterly checks dividends. 

Also working while, get bonuses. get 2500 bonus March 2500 bonus October.

Also sundays pay time half.

Also cashiers get premium pay high volume cash handling. good costco cashier.

Costco also gave health benefits working part time. one college students university health care. yeah difference companies treat employees. deal retail bs costco target. difference Costco paid much better deal retail bs made much easier smile Karen's. Holy crap 15?? Wow stand corrected, edit number. Omg one night! 15! virus really spread like wildfire. yet somehow asshole still COVID free. I've seen bit youtube pay much attention him. done that's wrong? way, does. 

The likely people catch people flaunt restrictions behave irresponsibly. point ""we know"" way people push pet policies without evidence support them. 

For know, population may infected developed detectable antibodies epidemic August. See easy is? mean, know. Population control need shut whore mouth Reminds rabies Office. got 'zona 'rona. Live PD: Wanted mild case. I'm little ignorant reading numbers like these. statistically clinically significant? AZDHS cases per 100,000

100,000/569 = 175

That means 1 case per 175 people.  They’ve honestly gotta there, like that’s kind baffles most. He’s putting direct danger sake ego stroke. He’s literally digging grave politically speaking, it’s wild watch guess quells misconception destroyed heat. sheer incompetence - you’re going fully reopen, fine. least take sensible precautions like enforce wearing masks limit large groups people confined areas. Naw, dude. cases, killing police. Kneeling man's neck kills one time, must stopped. enforcing mask wearing potentially kill hundreds even thousands. sheriffs fired. Trump almost guaranteed getting sort experimental antibody injections. Yeah community pool 50% capacity means technically 75 people there, that's like I've ever seen.  I'm liberal hope true but... slate great source. miss protests went couple weeks around country? Lot support protests. second riots looting started lot support dropped off. think anywhere close majority support “eat rich” missed lesson nation wide protests. Many pandemic deniers end catching people already acknowledge .

The vast majority people fine . next couple days yes. far enough along timeline increase numbers yet. happen soon. next Wednesday. exposed beat actively coughing lung? wonder he’s defended enforcing rules getting infected? Yup sure did. guess long one family dies it’s big deal. Sorry misunderstood, meant professional organization like bar association. Apparently term professional association Renewed year DFW area. $720/month 700sqft nice neighborhood. Unfortunately I'm driving 45 minutes work whatever lol Arizona surprisingly full morons #HA-HA Latest FOUR Houston hospitals overwhelmed COVID 19. serious, hearing anywhere part. Also, two weeks, start seeing fifty thousand new cases day cities, time statewide lockdowns, governors states see reason. this, almost forgot North South Carolina. ""local resident says ""covid gay"". Gets covid"" 5 times day. fucking hilarious ah tip mah hat yah    I’ll take “Same thing homeless guy lives bus stop says”, 200 Alex. im assuming anything, presenting anything certainty.

please misinterpret reading presenting think piece believing going happen. know, seems like something... oh, dunno... intelligent? Yes, intelligent word, realize passages true one merely interprets ""God wants us pray together UNLESS dangerous so, case wants us careful - also show-off hypocrite case!""

That seem hard me. So, unless assume majority religious are... basically bit 'tarded, bit basic brainpan... real issue truly want seen praying showy, virtue signalling way Jesus warns against. owning house primary homestead residence? ""Unfortunately, law enforcement official elected leader, luxury staying home,"" Lamb wrote. ""This line work inherently dangerous, risk take sign job. .... Saturday, held campaign event, likely came contact infected individual.”

Yeah - risks one take campaign unavoidable us heroic law enforcement officials. /s first protests happened there. won’t see spike Minnesota yet backlog tests. spikes show later week next Wednesday latest. isnt political democratic party? correct side it, still political. Well, Trump's whole base dies off, could help Biden. God knows use help get right now. bubble? They’re based supply demand constrained renters income? Could imagine. losers whine then? Suck libs cucks. We're going shove universal health care throats! I'm large man know like woman friend told guy tried rub train home work. I'm glad social distancing giving women break creeps.  Well except provided several points evidence lockdowns infected. Unless thought people Germany, South Korea, New Zealand, Iceland, Vietnam, Thailand, Hong Kong, Taiwan, etc naturally immune virus? Peru great, maybe outlier, maybe, maybe strict lockdown without strong central authority work, unclear. 

So believe done nothing, nothing would different, country true? indoor venue likely close 19,000 attendees, thousands come city, visit bars, restaurants etc since phase 3 reopening. 

They're also going provide masks, require worn.

It's easier OK town, indoor events shoulder shoulder contact hours arguably much riskier outdoor protests.

People going dumb, people later exposed result. going die. law reason cannot intervene, do. Everything possible hypocrite  seems aggressively low 5% damn.

I would assume it’s somewhere two lol, saw 45% due COVID19. excuse companies using cut costs. successful go away COVID19 does. mention cash machine “brrrrrrrrrr” already posted Reposts removed initial point cases Cook county extremely low, including day 50. 

Your response transit route, lots people go back forth. conclusion drawing that? Yes, keep giving reasons people move, what's result that? hope fuckin dies odds Trump gets infected time he’s done rallies? Reddit kinda shitty system. make obvious statement get upvotes. question thoughts ideology rains downvotes. Kind downer interested conversations wanting talk community. 

My thing is, don’t vaccine, one does. another year possibly 2! government isn’t much curb numbers quarantine. won’t get another stimulus, go work go work. got store every 2 weeks, I’m lucky see people every time working hard. don’t get tested every day, probably don’t even get tested month. delivering, hands shit. FWIW personally don’t wear gloves. felt like guy making sandwich wear them, guy filling Rx would also.  blood hands! Great work, shitbag! tough use NYC predictor high level immunity though. cities dont 25% people immune limit spread. 5 them, [it wearing masks. woman nurse. 

43 people total got infected going one bar. alot people afford rent anymore. starts next couple days. see. reason people like convinced real dead bodies. stupid. Thanks climate change, likely catastrophic hurricanes wildfires year Speeding 1 mph even then, cases likely number less two hundred, maybe even hundred, probably tens millions infections age group worldwide exceptions, rules covid reacts.

Edit: shit, people 35 probably higher chance dying Covid’s usual stuff getting super rare issues Yayyyy... live like five hours away Tulsa... Walmart stores 30 registers 3 ever open lol. I'm cashier-less stores :) know difference general anesthesia sedation-learn something new every day! Lol

Thanks advice well wishes! goes trumps economy. want morons stop taking stupid risks. mean would guessed people ignore safety precautions likely contract coronavirus!? Darwin took wheel one. know. saying banks longer position to, longer fail safety measures implemented Great Depression, example, freezing stock market trading falls 3 set intervals 7%, 13% 20%. various provisions like protect economy whole. course stock market economy holds trillions trillions dollars reason many people use judge economy doing.

OP mentioned Great Depression, followed stock market crashed back 1920. one main factors Great Depression first place. Trying manipulate media try convince I’m required wear mask don’t legal authority perfect example tyranny wraps good intentions, tyranny none less Well, law enforcement essential services play devil’s advocate even stay fuck home shift. Play Call Duty act like players selling loose cigarettes. still can’t wait woop Jesus homies Easter gets everyone cured! meanwhile, yesterday thinking never felt healthy pandemic never get close people wear mask every time go public. people assume say something inevitable means want happen? fuck wrong YOU? god, must absolutely shitty person. horrible assumption make.

Seriously fuck wrong you? Lol love everyone celebrating fact sick. really shitty vindictive people sub. 

Imagine happy someone ill. Deranged losers. Yeah presumably live fucking downtown Omaha. I'd pay shit load avoid too. Ben Shapiro told masks don’t always work! No, obviously not. simple lines of; ""if want **that** better pay lot now"". fairly simple obvious. I'm hating US all. cancelled 4-week vacation there, love place. However, nation, overconfident, certain circumstances, that's helpful. Muuurica Fair enough, case vaccinations work either, likely. counties need this. couple dozen hospitalizations whatsoever. I've advocated criteria based on, example, hospitalizations. hand, tf not? Let's get done! Hurts nobody. Potentially allows economy open without outbreaks. statewide order best it.  Haha. Mines One way redundant you’re allowed pass aisles anyway. One thing remember AC Spanish flu. summer necessarily slower rate increase. guess don’t know sure best information right suggests risk enclosed space extended period time (15 min +). Outside doesn’t seem pose risks. Cuomo total disaster. Look many died incompetence! Yes, does. still preferable kind society years, vaccine comes. Joblessness leads homelessness crime lower life expectancy, people going die younger either way. Finally. Americans need pay teachers more. Compared private sector, teaching basically volunteer work. countries teaching one highest paid professions. competitive, attracts smartest, motivated candidates. ""Thank you"" ""understanding"" rather unhappy much I'm paying apartment within short train ride downtown LA...and unable really anything. Money well spent... lobbying. virus care protest? people get infected/killed reckless protests care protesting? solid data Wuhan? PNAS solid source, I'd love see something department epidemiology based say, Europe, USA, SKorea, Taiwan data. 

I fear often, more, complicated, masks this, distancing that, depends temperature, inside/outside, air conditioning... NZ citizens exit ban, allowed leave entire time quarantine return. Demonstrates exit bans needed (yes I'm talking Australia) 😂 suspect hangs damaged lung/organ tissue. Like viral version Tuberculosis. body begins clean damage gets again.

But immunity first infection. also concerning.

My suspicion behavior derived evolutionary history evolving spreading amongst bats. needs airborne spread bat colonies. needs find way hang long term colony, otherwise immunity quickly render extinct.  74 years old. Decent chance gets pretty fucked it, kill outright. generally based city live in. example, county's ""first death"" man caught Grand Princess died hospital San Francisco without ever returning home. didn’t actually meet President guess shows President protected. Less everyone else met. Got political rally. Meanwhile Trump plans rally weeks 000s travelling meet him. Split two people people need understand this. virus could change lot young lives worse. People long transplants damage done. fact, Korea peninsula. northern land border tightest guarded world. previous person crossed border hit least three shots fellow shot dead spot. difference South Korea Taiwan. island. Chronic medical terms mean permanent. conditions acute defined less week, anything beyond chronic, although longer 3 months common. Aq Lol that, high income California transplant coming buy good real estate Portland proper. actually get along cali peeps locals want burst flames. i'm friends people support structural racism. standards. Australian here, news morning announced University Canberra allowed first trial bringing International Uni kids in. ACT (Australian Capital Territory Canberra is) 0 cases quite time now. plane chartered somewhere China come Canberra. students complete 2 week quarantine like citizen resident currently returns country. flight hold 350 students said prioritise gets spots - students last year degree, need lab complete degree etc - basically first cannot complete online. students paying - government school. pay share chartered flight cost 2 weeks quarantine hotel. universities propped wealthy Chinese students interesting schools allowed follow suit this. explained news chartered flight students little contact entire process. watching closely see goes. theory sounds ok government also let entire cruise ship infected people testing resulted like half cases - shall see. reacting little bit you? useless info coronavirus. mean Borris get guy universally offered. universally accepted. simple health practice think custom masks great idea! fun it. one's enjoying pandemic least mindful others community wear damn (customized mask). Unfortunately think mask wearing political statement decision based logic. ignorance blinding Victorian grateful burdened cost case numbers returning travellers. /r/target

Mostly typical retail stuff, stores particularly poorly managed. I’m glad better hope back 100% soon! much absolute number cases hospitalizations deaths rather transmission rate one. Declining numbers three need congratulated PA. Let's hope CA jump board. Hashtag commonsense. i've bunch i've following cities social media. i've barely seen anyone maskless. . human race fuck right off. human race mistake.

The likely impact balance power 400 years finally shifts towards east asia again. I'm sorry situation. bad lot people especially difficult.

I would advise put concerns writing (email) relevant department manager company. Specifically mention ways company offering sufficient protections employees ask address issues. Mention health concerns feel comfortable so.

Thank done, I'm sure precautions place, make clear firmly believe must done, including strongly encouraging requiring masks among customers. Use State CDC guidelines company complying 100%. Many businesses seem - sometimes even despite policies.

They likely make changes (who knows though), correspondence whether go back may help protect ways might expect long run. at? One worst food ever eaten. grow like opening Multnomah county (Portland) Friday, actually masks buy. think issues reading ability. find help here:

www.wikihow.com/Improve-Your-Reading-Skills%3Famp%3D1 Many believe mass transmission recent protests. kid adopted biological parents dead maybe I’m putting shoes so. 

And never read forever sounds like good money. that’s me. want move City I'd rather take BART Muni every day. Give another week two. said thing even numbers continue rise scary rates I’m begging family stay won’t... won’t even wear mask. feel helpless. give 30 days breaking lease work retail. instructed corporate confront people entering store without mask ""we dont want employees get shot spit on"". like we're risk matter what. Ok CCP, considering article says loans negligible amount total debt african countries owe essentially land grab africa chinese past 10 years would call propaganda gesture anything. Shout $390/m apartment fly state. would've street played anymore fuck fauci, funded $10MM wuhan lab study coronavirus gain function 2011 Yeah I’ve dealt confrontation trying record situations flights past...ie. plane hit bird needed make emergency landing went fire, whole cabin reeked jet fuel, flight attendants freaking running aisles yelling record anything, yet nobody willing inform passengers issues plane obviously encountering landed flame retardant foam news channel waiting film us.....

When rightful attempts record concerning situations you’re witnessing met conflict (especially something simple flights claiming clean failing adhere basic safety guidelines aka pull damn mask nose least....) highlights big problem truly is! 

Something needs done; avoidable BS humans weren’t lazy/negligent corporations cheap (despite bailout funding coming easy phone call away gov’t)! replace Africans Han colonialist settlers like Tibet. 

Tibet part china since qing dynasty dude. Even taiwan territorial claim tibet what, scissors stick? I'd like show like small flu. Mask nose kid one all.

Very clever. left car,

I figure ""I left car"" probably code ""I left home""

and ""I left home"" probably code ""I one &amp; want one"" isn't. 4,000 new cases today, weighted population par FL. outrage told ya disgust FL gets, Cali spared here. wonder why? wish store could buzz people in. mask, entry. Several studies already shown need lock again... would wear masks. Big city life eats people alive, work like crazy plus socializing stay competitive want live right places hang right crowd, costs money. banks often give loan amount rent everything always America? Shit's getting real He's lying usual. Harvard Nutritional Epidemiologist. want real deal go follow Marc Lipsitch it’s ok get sick, bring home family, also gets sick, brings store cashier gets sick brings someone’s car grocery pickup get sick. That’s ok respect freedom, hell everyone else’s freedom breathe diseased air? hell everyone else’s life liberty could make reckless choice going rally pandemic Orange Mutant Senile Turtle humane enough hold danger poses base. 

If Tru-mp wants murder sicken base ego happy oblige, means, name freedumb. sounds like backing opinion either way I’m like anonymous online persona. It’s easier asshole online, I’m pleasant person get asshole fix reddit. Would help someone looking buy home?  ""Don't worry,"" Texas Gov. Abbott thought. ""We'll throw away sprawl advantage reopening fast. It'll super easy -- barely inconvenience!"" ....who says. masks don’t help, says. I’m fan. one orange? WOW SHUT ORLANDO AIRPORT NOW!!!! Wrong. China never ANYTHING could qualify category ""good"" news. sure Xi dirty, greedy little communlst hands nations bureaucracy waiting first opportunity turn so-called ""nations"" full blown Chinese vassals outposts. replace Africans Han colonialist settlers like Tibet. fact could believe otherwise betrays dangerous immaturity naivete geopolitics power general. think breathe collective sigh relief charge anything. Eh, maybe. We're ok Europe cases going way down.

Austria Switzerland less 1000 active cases, Baltic states + Croatia, Slovakia Slovenia looking amazing. Scandinavia - Sweden also great, Germany peachy + Italy seeing giant fall active cases. Italy keeps might less 10k active cases end month. problem US Brazil right now? really hear Hotspots shit? Two people know got diagnosed Orange County, it’s there... heard HOAG seeing uptick. sad merely want prevent hospital beds 100% utilized think win anything less. Woah Everyone sitting waiting everyone else get herd immunity. UBI would allow sorts industries evolve. Fauci saying go.... classic. NY rents seem crazy me. I'm learning Less harm he'll reelected. Funeral director here...that’s number isn’t even accurate nursing homes moving people hospitals soon test positive..which good pass nursing home it’s nursing home death...also dnr may test you..also drs aren’t putting covid death certificates whether nursing home tells family doesn’t want death certificate Wait, chick fila minimum wage? fuck run 10x better fast-food places? thought paying get level work employees. post removed cannot verify reliable source.

They know. that's they've got now. Well increased testing found cases. interesting see trend future seem like big news solution would also require government supply everyone multiple cloth masks. proper use mask requires remove wash soon home. go day washed dry, need new one. anything else unsafe. 

Everyone know, 1 mask wash maybe every couple days, gross going make sick. stimulus check income researchers say new coronavirus also transmitted aerosols, minuscule droplets float air longer large droplets. aerosols directly inhaled.

That’s may happened restaurant Guangzhou, China, infected diner yet ill transmitted virus five others sitting adjacent tables. Ventilation space poor, exhaust fans turned off, according one study looking conditions restaurant.

At March 10 church choir practice Washington state, 87% attendees infected… Members choir changed places four times 2½-hour practice, tightly packed confined space mostly older therefore vulnerable illness, said. told, 53 61 attendees practice infected, including least one person symptoms. Two died.

Of 61 clusters cases Japan Jan. 15 April 4, many involved heavy breathing close proximity, karaoke parties, cheering clubs, talking bars exercising gyms.

An estimated 10% people Covid-19 responsible 80% transmissions, according study published recently Wellcome Open Research. people virus may higher viral load, produce droplets breathe speak, confined space many people bad ventilation they’re infectious point illness.

The attack rate Covid-19 households ranges 4.6% 19.3%, according several studies. higher spouses, 27.8%, household members, 17.3%, one study China.

No one knows sure much virus takes someone become infected, recent studies offer clues. one small study published recently journal Nature, researchers unable culture live coronavirus patient’s throat swab milliliter sputum contained less one million copies viral RNA.

He colleagues found samples contagious patients virus levels 1,000 times that, could help explain virus infectious right conditions: may take much lower levels virus what’s found sick patient infect someone else.

Some scientists say aerosol transmission occur, doesn’t explain infections. addition, virus doesn’t appear spread widely air.

“If transmitted mainly like measles tuberculosis, infectious virus lingered airspace long time, spread across large airspaces air-handling systems, think would seeing lot people infected,” said CDC’s Dr. Brooks.”   noticed.

Then open things back up, mask wearing, continued social distancing, contact tracing/quarantine cases. pandemic causing economic problems lockdowns.  Lockdowns ended weeks yet economy recovered gotten worse.  Business owners hesitant reopen consumers spending money clue future holds even still job next month much less anything else. ive found often big time landlords ones worst greedy. small time landlords dont bunch properties million tenants often nicer easier deal Try drinking Elderberry tea. Niacin help flush respiratory virus. work department, company 4 stage back office plan stage 4 minimum end year waves. personally high risk (immune compromised due rheumatoid arthritis) remote treatment vaccine. Notthing day, every day! Pics happen. I'm excited. getting ready buy house next year two. currently live Bay Area, considering moving cheaper location buy house. market crashes, might stay here. freedom something. Americans always hard time understanding limit freedom infringes other's freedom.

THIEF... believe it. playing twister. new things are. proves effective hopefully economies scale allow widely accessible. logic implies masks can't make things worse. benefit. untrue. Masks worn properly incredible majority make things far worse none. America done Australia done. broad lock easing restrictions plan states implement them. Also states communicate give president power mandate stuff like masks could fault...the tens thousands young ""protestors"" or..? really think safe boarders open?

Also, Hong Kong never really closed borders China. Spread protesters contacts, days/week become symptomatic, days weeks go hospital. question, logarithmic graphs mean compared normal graphs? never cashier - actually complicated seems. definitely reason death rate going way - testing serious cases like lots places start pandemic, obviously going get massively inflated death rate sample space include mild symptoms. real scary numbers like 3.4% IFR 20% hospitalisation rates coming initial reports China. testing starts get rolled progressively catch mild asymptomatic cases found far often young people, suspect prompted headline. Interestingly, best explanation Africa hit super hard virus - ton old people like West death rates going drastically reduced. manager recently grocery store could scan 36 items minute, doesnt sound really fast always got compliments speed didnt squish bread eggs either lol. That's weird conclusion. boggles mind people like exist. Jesus... sounds like Ecuador Lmao, they? Transmissions time smaller outdoors people naturally keep larger distance too. doubt playing Twister outdoors. Could rephrase? I'm hostile, genuinely quite understand trying say. claim China sweetheart investing countries ignorant. Look Hambantota port Sri Lank China taken gave predatory loans Sri Lanka. Jeez... Leave city. 3000 sq ft home 4 acres nearly pay 700 sq ft. we're summer, imagine shit winter alternative people take matters hands open shit anyway. NYC businesses literally ignoring state reopening plan. People going lockdown forever virus 0.5% death rate. Don’t look now, 4th July celebration around corner. thought hard keep people home before... agree you. friend bought three bedroom apartment did. bragged charging me. six tenants, one tenant. didn’t repairs mine took good care place. spent 50k redo floors, bathrooms, kitchen tenants wrecked whole apartment. Good tenants blessing. That's nice make difference front line retail workers needless loss because, healthy people like Ms. Strozier discounted ignorant others (and, know We're Talking About).

I plan dedicate today loving memory Ms. Strozier others sacrifice lives every day may live peace harmony., day, sooner later going act like China predatory? Look Hambantota. dont understand states seems easing everything soon they’ve got cases world :/ tests cashierless store *save money* Reminder initially said masks worn general population dont help really ? come they’re putting statements back peddling quickly ? make announcement didn't. thing, buddy 16th according worldometer. every country. Yep, / working time.

I'm amazed many health care workers see scrubs Walmart wearing masks way work really true, self distancing, seem take serious. minister foreign affairs resently critisized danish turists behaviour, couse care all: get close people, push tables together resturants real life right now?  didnt really kind formal shutdown. part common sense healthcare worker don’t see much defend cost try correct blatant misinformation give context. ones defending critical parts. since it’s used example opening still closed it’s often use since they’re interested context open/close. gave unemployed people least $2400/month. I'm sure propaganda countries gave people income came from. America learn China, end America.

While America learn Taiwan.  give excuse say ""see part, yours"" mean safe wear mask? otherwise would say world still trying herd immunity

Why would say that? Meanwhile UNHCR said human right it. Lol city, London Ontario prices arent follow trends going them. housing prices going throughout this. Even GTA prices going down. I'm never gonna able afford house. Wait, mean every year contract renewed rent go up? protection tenant? That's nuts! sure, virus around like one, kills people earn 500k $/year would living bunkers military outside shooting us live. Per capita. likely die covid die hands cops, applies races.

Yeah. read posted.  relation Nursultan Tulyagbi, pain Borat's assholes? could take picture right shocked (20 old young people playing park together) actually offered decrease rent increased hundred dollars months lockdown. feel bad struggling midst lockdown. reduced rent still leaves lots extra money covering mortgage, property tax, income tax, building maintenance fee. not?

BTW TSA setting standards, individual airlines. can’t get plane 4 oz liquid, spray Coronavirus plane?

good luck don’t back words? hard understand.

I never claimed expert shared information received healthcare professionals healthcare department. 

You keep asking questions already told get information reliabe healthcare sources. 

Why even still asking anything? 
You clearly mind made up. panicked saw rising death toll want seen someone care.

Reality economic damage caused lockdowns worse economic damage caused virus itself. Lockdowns also something people willing put long periods time, even Doomers sub think hide bunkers forever. desert sand kind sand used glass...

It is.

Take medium smaller city like Montgomery, make responsible well surrounding 60+ mile radius, it’s easy hit divert thresholds. likely begin diverting bit early keep free capacity acute trauma cases won’t last long enough divert. almost like needed someone control states one level them, like one presides something. bad. Also biologist ;) let try explain little bit in-depth:

Innate immune system technical term one two big immune barriers responses humans - innate adaptive one. fight e.g. viruses. 

Somehow could count cells it, think typically done.

But indeed skin, barrier e.g. seen part system.

The first strong reaction know, early inflammation site infection - point virus needs identified, adaptive immune system ""trained"" needed - innate immune reaction triggered e.g. chemicals released cells damaged inflammation starts, site gets red, hotter, swollen, might feel already pain on, fight begins.

The innate immune system one reacts first (in hours typically), builds barrier infection, tries stop moving around body on, finally also activates adaptive immune system.

How good (that's really weak strong - strong also bad there) innate system reacts particular virus, pretty different people. 

If really good particular virus, get infected working virus particles, might fight virus off, adaptive system never really activated. Texas Coronavirus sub, guy posted meme thread TX surpassed FL #8 state COVID case count, right around 5 weeks ago. passed MI #7, one week that. passed PA #6, one week ago.

I took look various states average daily new-case counts past 14 days. current trends hold (and knows, could **get worse**), TX surpass #5 July 1st, pass IL #4 mid-August pass NJ #3 late August. high AZ FL's new case counts been, Texas's even higher, appear poised surpass us.

And there's vaccine within 13 months, there's non-zero chance could bypass NY #2, though appear we'll catch CA #1, seeing head start higher daily new-case counts.

SO fuck them. whole individuality responsibility thing slightly unreasonable, opinion. agree important part fighting pandemic, really can't stand own. virus strange one - people infect all, others wildly infectious - point almost impossible avoid infection near individual.

Trying reduce average number contacts societal level huge impact effective individual measures are. also helps reinforce importance actual measures taken. I'm saying lockdown everything hardcore curfew - we've seen far milder measures big impact, especially taken early on.

I agree observation many, most, people part. easy misled examples reckless behavior observe, forget sensible behavior can't see.

Where think Sweden went wrong early effort - dealing virus massive variance infectiousness, really important keep initial outbreak control. think hubris FHI assume like flu outbreak would go away certain % infection (it's 10%-20% flu) due partial ""herd immunity"" (I really like term misleading) seasonal effects.

So elderly homes - virus widespread, impossible keep out. can't ask staff isolate completely. get infected, bring in.

The sensible (and economically viable) way fight virus keep infection low outbreaks handled local level, rest society function almost like normal. ""attrition"" strategy gamble, failed. wish FHI right - would better everyone, sadly that's SARS variant works.

I hope manage get control side Öresund. live minutes harbor Copenhagen, friends Sweden. saddens health authorities stubborn refused err side caution. Hopefully things brighten soon us. elderly? FL, reporting nursing home deaths many people get hospitalized. tested, reported, sent. Everything relative. 5% asymptomatic?

But perhaps likely explanation either seroprevalence survey 25% assumption junk. Yeah that's accurate number. multiple reports 7 percent 75 percent (I remember reading 80) - there's still lot know many asymptomatic vs pre-symptomatic.

They appear doubling weekly recent weeks. speculatively it'll get 4x worse hospitals 8x worse morgues (assuming testing people post-mortem), assuming completely flatten things (R=1) tomorrow (which utterly unrealistic). Orange County Florida. Tuskegee historical events. Women color currently dying in/shortly childbirth huge health crisis country. Many medical professionals believe people color higher pain tolerances, thicker skin can't feel pain all. Even adjust wealth insurance, people color much likely given outdated procedures medications. God Blessed Texas hand, brought COVID Chinese man, gave us place social dis-tance wanna see heaven brother here's chance, I've sent spread message. Mmmmm Tough shit Texas. point feel safer protest restaurant/bar. people masks everyone basically throwing hand sanitizer eachother. We’all gunna die mother! YEEHAW! never gets mentioned matter much raise minimum wage, payroll dollar budget stays same. Meaning hourly wage goes up, amount hours allotted stores goes down. Target expects higher paid employee efficient therefore won’t need much time job. Granted, sales skyrocketed pandemic payroll budgets gone window, end day intention always cut size pie different sized pieces. This. Mosquitoes different deep southern states irrigation systems everywhere outside cities. mosquito’s seriously block street lights. Expect parties summer go outside inside 7pm. appreciate anecdotal evidence, really hard use someone like son evidence long term effects. I'm going assume he's young, active, shape (plays football). Many young people infected showed symptoms all. 

It's total different story talking someone that's overweight 70 years old. There's chance never fully recover know. example would broken hip. big deal death sentence others. course it’s not. I’m sarcastic. mods getting really pedantic I'd interested see difference Canadian US cities Canada generally hit much less hard equivalent US cities covid could always cut hands off. Efficient. Well least might get real data much things help. situation warrants it, fundamental problems wearing mask indefinitely. Much Asia already it.  really big deal. I'm old enough remember many people bitched freedoms seat belts became mandatory, complete non issue.  Masks would way reason needed longer term.
 
But end game drive virus level risk encountering (or contracting) minimal.  could via vaccine treatements.  could social distancing, masking, testing, contact tracing- piss poor job strategy.

What can't pretend thing exist like dealing anymore. TX already spiking cases. pour gasoline fire. Hopefully hurricane roll year trying extinguish dumpster fire. Ok, still misleading me, current hotspot ok, silly compare place already come hit worse. Thanks clarification though, confused. Makes sense damn fool best troll.

It doesn’t.

It feels middle class. whining overburdened covid-19? Cause going leave white people test it, know work you? bad Govenors insisting masks. every mask worn, black person could get sick die. Keep mind couple weeks separates infection hospitalization. So, even somehow cut new infections zero, we'd continue see exponential growth hospitalizations least 2 weeks. 

Given new cases appear doubling every two weeks government seems uninterested 2nd shutdown, dont see way see way Texas avoids saturating hospital system. like New York without shutdown take edge tsunami cases come. tell sacrifice could save economy. die happy.

But test result came back negative went party night, really sad think one family members gonna die take shit seriously. 9 consecutive weeks fewer new cases. May 10 soon. mean anybody listened medical doctors knew this. information public since feb/March. fact country still denying pretending like virus won’t totally ravage America completely asinine. world didn’t go lock flu. NBA: Yikes unilateral choice? know interpreting info from. Nowhere say forced gave decision, quit.

Seriously look post history, click **OUTBREAK ALERTS** look many say [Removed] costco Dallas city live closing businesses due people work businesses testing positive. Quebec. 5th hardest hit place world country. sentiment problem old folks homes. Case count want means life normal screw wearing masks.

The second wave gonna hit hard back lock Thanksgiving Christmas. going lot harder losing parents grandparents still active enjoying life losing grandparents great grandparents shut away forgotten long term care. source that? I’ll google update comment find it. want send numbers friends I’d like send source According current study, infection estimates February 7, 2020, fell 305,000 1,272,000, death estimates projected 6,811 7,223 deaths. least ten times official figure, 13,600 545, respectively. 

So, still fraction US UK had, even use bullshit methods ""estimate"" ""true number"". It’s hard tell difference science entities trying cover lawsuits. Thank God ""only"" 20% octogenarians (it's actually 'octogenarians', let's go humor you) require hospitalization.

Believe well familiar hospitalization rates among age groups. several countries course, sure would SUCK among 20% - many heavily sedated ventilator jammed throat since lungs essentially filling superglue.

Yes would! would suck get pneumonia drown pus too. bad covid season prior covid season. *cries Alabama* flu actually kill nearly many. actually tracked, numbers based 1960s model left place goal making people fearful flu useful getting people vaccinated (not much start used justification COVID-19 bad). saw article several ER doctors saying never saw death flu entire careers several people dying per day care COVID-19. pride... priceless damaged longer care want go back forth people simply refuse take seriously. I'm gonna wear mask best protect others around me. see bunch people wearing masks certain area store I'll avoid go home come back time less packed, one gonna change mind now, especially much time passed. people actually affected i.e. becoming extremely ill loved ones start dying. nothing gonna change minds. Screw accelerate herd immunity going now. target shareholder, still shit company. worked nearly 20 years ago moved Costco, still working industry dipshit. texas creeping closer red line ICU , steadily moving toward max capacity last two weeks, really sucks large parts texans live many miles ICU time already essence transported.

sweden's model working hot getting antibodies everyone, last saw 10-20%, would 1/6th 1/3rd way semblance normalcy. 

reducing slow burning gives time treatment studies. remdesivir example, know helps, know three months ago ""herculean effort get everybody treated"" would still failed. new steroid thing passes muster, illnesses delayed good treatment better

edit: texas chart 800 couple weeks ago little town went fairly low number cases showing NY Times hotspot report course 5 days. Places can't assume they've bypassed far continue bypassed. Yeah fucking shit hope best them.

Pick one Probably! Good sleuthing. Point that. claims without evidence dimissed without evidence, evil chinese evidence. Look figures.

Denmark: 104 deaths per million 
Norway: 45 deaths per million 
Finland: 59 deaths per million 
Sweden: 500 deaths per million still climbing steady rate

Sweden's gamble failed. long term, would get soooo much better lot reasons.

cool, hope future 100% accurate. local rock station frequently posts memes mocking pandemic ""owning libs."" I've lost faith texans. don’t understand bogged partisan politics. common sense level leadership. asked question before. Herd immunity one thing, integrating economy travel others region quite another.

If achieve herd immunity nation has, going lonely long time. Gotta keep appearances sake politics cdc says surfaces transmit virus? believe them. say wipe groceries, notice, absolutely mostly kept cool environments IL continues drop, lowest percent positive ever yesterday (along week lowest cases since beginning April). idea orange here, make much sense given data. thing dying hope V shaped recovery. economy going stay open without issue, virus boss.

Well yeah, change “only 100 people died heart disease today” people would un-phased. I’m sure point is. Stop lepers then! want enjoy summer neighbours, guys making difficult friends. 

All coughing. Well either:

 a) CDC recommends masks, enough everyone.

Or 

b) CDC recommend masks, enough doctors people willingly choose wear said recommendation.


Take pick. 3 month old account, every comment sub, many China related posts... hmmmmmm  sureeee are. really ruined. sort thing expected.

There mistake made first two allowed quarantine 'compassionate' reasons, tested contacts traced well.

We'll know soon enough whether caused infections, stands, nothing happened expected happen. question whether procedures place prevent spreading community.

This first test shown weakness fixed. Huge frat parties SF bay area, thousands partying drinking masks. Problem may affected go home parents grandparents, that's we'll see rise ICU cases. “safe distancing ambassador” thumbnail photo needs training “mask wearing ambassador” extortion. think might translation issue (or misspoke), Reuters report earlier week said Sweden's back normal mortality level time year. Except won’t, you’ll demand doctors nurses woefully little PPE kill selves save fat ass. great Bob... people caring, protests. study country (Austria) around double amount officially accounted for. also cant dismiss ppl die without ever diagnosed covid 19... dark numbers go one way. heard I'm relieved hear that? We’re still safe potential surge doesn’t come absolutely shows masks radically change course pandemic parents basically said “F me” “virus dying out” “masks optional”. They’ve blocked Facebook they’re tired anti-Trump political posts riles sisters (my aunts) don’t get along, agree politically. Well, bad.

Yeah sucks, is. sure ain't gonna change Trump helm. really figured 2016 people would realize that, are. maybe make masks absolutely mandatory, staying home optional? 

Nah, would make much sense. Let's force stay home destroy economy, go outside, tell wear? Isn’t one sheriffs Live PD? someone who’s hometown Sheriff Joe’s totally understand.  Absolutely mouths touched spot someone back washed. That's saliva transfer.  Like blood children developed antibodies? Would make sense.

Maybe elderly blood spicer things up. precedent set earlier already people protesting lockdown itself. support mass protest... campaign rallies bad... Protest riots 20 days.... damn campaign rallies open states causing covid numbers increase. protest riots. Must conservatives.   Rip first wave never ended went unpaid medical leave work. anxiety disorder getting called back work sparked new severe panic attacks. think still claim unemployment, something new stress top it. Good times. Germany rt-PCR tests paid private statutory insurance doctor deems necessary public health does.

Not e.g. company wants antibody tests, know, e.g. whole staff. also need pay that. want antibody test yourself, know, public health medical reason. also fully pay that.  real death rate really around 1% France severely underreporting exactly talking about. care home deaths. think Germany care homes? also enough tests beginning pandemic. heavily prioritize. people symptoms health care/nursing home workers, restricting visitation mean fuck nursing home employees go around spread virus. 

But telling everybody act infected help nobody. stated, nursing home employees stay home let elderly starve, acting infected? That's whack. need know need test. Also protect elderly protect people surrounding them. healthcare workers. health care workers safe population around tested/ wears masks.

Unless robots care work, protect people protect elderly.

And concerning original link, rumour authorities discouraging even restricting access proper health care vulnerable, really true, that's really fucked 3rd Reich euthanasia shit.

It’s same. two weeks superspreading event bump cases happens, deaths week later.

I made mistake long time ago - thought virus going move much quickly actually does. assumption ~about~ (on verge explosion exponential growth) back April lockdowns began. happens next state state, depending lot different factors. prediction NYC extremely well compared DC already went virus, saw looters N95 masks live-streams. Much protestors.

DC would worried about. watched sort security camera thing mall last Saturday looked like festival. Music, line dancing, sing alongs, thousands people packed closely together. lot wearing masks. Many, many hoping see.

Edit: see Florida big superspreader event 16th bump deaths started couple weeks later. showing work every day dealing endless arrays customers absolutely. hospital/clinic even so, kind behind enemy lines point. office, probably much less long people forced come work sick. Still nothing say you’re vindictive monster. Hmm. perfectly fine issues whatsoever....   Type B, hat.

Infections increased much gradual pace. Los Angeles concerning though LA region accounting clear majority existing new cases. Everyone find form activism. 

There room everyone get involved however feel help.

Besides, could spread doesn’t exist? Even though, would part ‘God’s plan’ anyway. How? Everyone, every media outlet, every politician constantly fear mongers something another. Political persuasion relevant always stay off-strip avoid riff-raff, I'm still comfortable. There's story either aware letting on. think post political, issues. said president along cdc gave false info. small detail kind failed flatten curve significantly first place. Masks help wearing time being. fuck place gonna fall ocean? ""less likely get seriously"" check marks, I'm still fucking headed bar restaurant anytime soon wear mask public. Ah missed one, thanks reposting. 

Yeah, ok, that's I've heard social media. Well, let's hope changes Icelandic situation everyone get tested border. That'd give wish thread too: Denmark would help Skåne Test, Trace, Isolate. would fine that. 'tested 72 hours before' thing nonsense though; like can't get infected 72 hour period testing. Iceland proposed similar thing changed actually opened border.

It kind amusing turning flip side happened show Rain: there's a(n invisible) wall around old Danish areas Sweden, IRL opposed show keep infection *out* in. Good. live Houston since opening I’ve seen less 5% people wearing mask everywhere go. one cares affects someone close them. Sad. Yeah, maybe masks lockdowns work, huh? ~~pull by~~ hang bootstraps median time went 5 months 4 months pandemic. That's reason shut country. slew studies posted r/COVID19 scientists epidemiologists making cases different type immune serology test - mucosal instead blood. people’s immune systems get rid virus via mucosal immune defense instead body mount huge response instead, cells would still remember virus fight it. said. believe.

I bore personal anecdotes wide manner personal loss I've experienced various health conditions, suffice say, pointing commenter blatantly lying, way implies help sick, risk obligation are.

However, lying fact vast majority population personal risk, really great place turn around ask altruistism. cannot blackmail, coerce, otherwise frighten people altruism. pretending there's risk not, dilutes effort focus attention truly risk, imho. Here's latest case/death charts Navajo area currently ranked #137 among US counties, terms per capita deaths. stand 79.82 per 100k population. US average useless knew got flu commission far classes school work went days least. wasn’t afraid feeling sick, afraid could GPA.

There’s people claim isn’t real. read comment morning someone claimed businesses conspiring closing claiming COVID cases make president look bad.

SARS different basically became sick time able spread relatively easy track stop people infecting others. one show symptoms start showing could infected everyone came contact 5 days beforehand.  Bullshit. take fake protest gtfo. racism. sounds miserable. I've never done maybe 160 two week stretch already thought pretty close maxed out. field in? Australia New Zealand summers first started getting community spread covid. Australia argument hot weather slowing spread. India well. India densest cities world high levels poverty. northern india become like NYC?

None states listed hit hard covid

Look, I'm saying hot weather ends covid. That's ludicrous. I'm saying examine data pretty clear covid, like every corona virus,is potent cold weather. may immune systems stronger summer. should, completely agree. 

Don't think anyone (except trump) arguing Didn’t Texas say like 2 weeks ago didn’t need masks? Amazing masks science based approach opening things do. Fingers crossed keep up. reminder tomorrows numbers, surprisingly low staff normally sending reports work, goes testing. Without getting seriously ill dying. college particularly severe flu seasons #1 priority avoiding flu. I'm genuinely curious comparison places mandated face masks vs places much COVID-19 cases surged places. [this I'm spent years losing SHIT TON weight. Finally looks, confidence- everything, finally getting women first time life. got enjoy 2 weeks going clubs bringing girls home god damn virus hit locked everything down. finally getting I'd wanted whole life worked hard years for, gone. 

You'd feel way! ""Did inspire others wearing mask social distancing?"" Good. Time start enforcing basic, beneficial responsibility.  I'm glad Maryland Ohio seem going OK did. That's wrote wrote. Here's latest chart Houston's (Harris County) ...Except twenty states increasing

since five minutes break left, fun info far ground really parachute. Figures full hospitals right 86% 80% 85% capacity

[South 70% capacity (or 75%, depending look: )

Keep looking states see feel. Perhaps care, facts.

The thing is, ""think"" close ground ditch parachute. wait sure. guess. question keeps night. Sorry hear that, hope you’re okay. don’t live Houston found article people lost someone close may well ones staying home. agree more! type communication start would made difference. I'm scientist give good explanation formal request retraction article submitted. 

This gives details flaws. certain hotzone counties re-opened have, specifically LA County. Dine eating allowed here, pretty crazy think accelerating numbers health officials warning might run ICU beds next month trends continue. There's huge pressure LA County officials rush re-opening since huge part local economy revolves around small &amp; midsized service firms can't work home. LA white collar/tech professional Bay area. really diverse economy huge amount light manufacturing, transportation/distribution course Hollywood-related businesses. region even oil refineries. blue-collar jobs means re-open going exponential rise close-contact activity chances covid spread. LOL, know saying. tell going without numbers. town 40k people, 2 deaths, 20 confirmed cases. I'll happier see numbers again. Wow. governor’s smug response really says all. dude, one making numbers. Nobody, least me, said LA driving force behind CA numbers comment history confirms.

Edit: way, ran numbers, ten states would still lower per capita cases CA LA excluded. chance something stupid like include LA's population came another falsity you? Though general rule self-quarantine 14 days attending protest, maybe wasn’t much spread non-protesters regardless. least that’s city handled husband job remotely fine three months. week he's go back office. let people stay home? risk everyone's health? 

They temp checks require people mask leave desks, that's lax IMO. Also says sees people time wearing masks incorrectly.

My boss talking like might bring people next month I'm already worried. hope reconsiders. Yet idiots town still going around telling covid exist asked “how would communicated that?” I've eaten weekly past month. issue. ""if get get it"" approach problem highly contagious virus. no, also ok protesters masks large crowds, already known spread way. think money politics sides time. government people sides learned things shutdown, good answers, get answers seeing. Thank you, remember this. Think Safety measure also short distance equal time lower level travel altitude also money waste little fuel needed. 

Yeah main concern sister told also door Impression handle situation improvised tactics. doorgunner problem open Doors absolut fit aircrafts.

Edit: problem open door reasonable altitude gets cold fell funny know problem. course short time would feel nothing more. person living Florida, ONE WEARING MASK ONE PHYSICAL DISTANCING. happens bullies *after* high school? Well regular jobs regular people. However, necessarily changed. stereotypical bully picked annoyed honor roll kids kids AP graduated still stigma ""smart kids."" Texas we're told good normal. we're probably going die. Bravo! Americans don’t patience attention span. Donate blood save lives. blood banks dire need donation world wide.  What??? Anti-science?

That's round-earthers WANT us believe! America's christian right legitimately frightening. much power, much money zero interest logic, evidence reason. scariest thing willing simply live according beliefs, instead stated goal force everyone else live according beliefs. common ISIS Taliban inwardly-focused sects like Amish Morons. Same... district likely utilize lowest amount precaution allowed. think too. Schools among last open pandemic Great. Starting residency Monday. Great news thrilled. 100 people died lake monster attacks. First Abbot said lock cities/counties manage own. 

Now he's saying cities/counties can't this. 

Abbot punk ass. See point avoid full scale nation wide lock swift reaction regional lock contact tracing, like Beijing now. sucks 300k people lock compared 20 million people Beijing already minimum damage. much sub wants another lockdown it’s going happen states. Many people done covid. going back. I'm sure Florida culture ""fuck everyone else, me"" plays role well. Going Worldometers, Sweden also hit 500 deaths per million. 

They seem one highest cases : death. else get cues? health ""experts"" jumping hoops justify protesting like virus cares political views. brand new Target neighborhood away cashiers entirely. one underpaid totally frantic worker troubleshooting dozen glitchy self-checkout stations time lines six eight customers deep security guard two door prevent shoplifting. employees anywhere near front. it’s nightmare workers. worst part live society taken sarcasm. still cant tell serious not. make look like wear mask, leave nose exposed?

I saw gym rat-looking dude Target day. problem New York City offices reopening. They'll turn around close bars, restaurants, gyms, movie theaters again... offices. Cuomo even want first week finally ended total lockdown. went 50% ""rotating employees"" 25% zero non essential people office. finally forced employer implement work home worked great everyone cost much end either.

And offices likely get NYC many buildings even windows open ventilation poor. Also, mercy sociopath employers news cameras standing door employer shaming way even people relatively safe activity like going beach.

In many states rushing reopening, nobody even talking offices lots people told stop working home forced back office reason boss managers like see people working. continuously blows away coming media reports reopening states. feel like even mean well interested facts case studies worldwide there. want granular info helps us create sliding scale potential danger safely navigate world reopening. another fucking circus watch. still pumping co2 atmosphere? Hawaii seems reasonable state country extended state emergency end July. strict lockdown least lowering guard like states.

I still get people opposed sheltering place vaccine developed/ distributed. safe method country resources/ money undertake it, gov. chooses to. many deaths sheer laziness need line pockets billionaires continue operate consumer economy. guess already second guess everything.  obvious everyone chatted back said that. worked shipping hub seen thousands masks get shipped abroad, couldn’t buy stores. People already stolen sanitizer walls children’s cancer hospital. 

I don’t know Fauci done, guarantee whatever said, someone would cursing today making wrong call. 

“He told everyone didn’t supply caused run! Doctors nurses died! didn’t control message public didn’t panic?” could *just easily* people arguing today. 

DPA invoked January 24th. sooner. science people against, perception people cannot trusted.  
 Anti-science bias exists people use experts science fit bias club political opponents, change stance want to. Fauci admitted others gave impression masks effective people would go buy preserve healthcare workers.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  truth, context thread homie. We're talking masks usefulness appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* Hospitalizations went falling flat rising uptick correlates well reopening. 16% increase since May 29. couple weeks ago Gov bragged 7% decrease partially justify reopening. I'd say 16% increase pretty significant. getting close time high.

Edit: Changed 6% 7%. [Was actually Puh-leeze. Probably half population would struggle tell even happened 9/11/01. changed nothing except procedure airport security lines. CCP propaganda twisted cognition  This, earnestly. enormous fuck taught us second guess every official announcement going get lot people killed.

my county would need 15 cases day match per million. can't imagine seeing number though Child care expensive would enough facilities. What’s solution though? Landlords often paying property taxes, maintenance costs, often houses/apts mortgaged. Eventually investments go could see mass foreclosures tenants would leave anyway. Yup! Whether states individuals learned little hook also catch fish artificial worm it... worm designed smell like real thing. Ok, Also Javier's Newport rumored outbreak  mask-only planes no-mask planes 

Darwinian seating options suddenly uturns convenient

Didn't change stance study put said mask use could cut infection rate 85% ?  wife Texas public school teachers 1 year old daughter risk.

This gives us endless anxiety. understand concept science ever evolving? 

Ideas/theories change they’re intended too.

Does everyone interprets science/data correctly? 

Obviously not, but, everyone stop parsing data facts coming reasonable conclusions?

It would better blindly believe unsubstantiated nonsense “faith” “reasons”? Agreed. Whenever word ""may"" used, remember, synonym ""May not"". They’re enjoying spotlight? lot experts receiving death threats I’m sure they’re enjoying that. I’ll look expert state quit threats getting. week away months now. going happen. want show energy towards establishments requiring shirt shoes service consider it. it. right. $1000 year, month. Thanks letting clarify Nothing wrong changing opinion light new facts., change opinion based new facts, changes based new *opinions* hears. problem getting people actually knowledgable subject on, seems like people thinks might agree him.  Go Amazon buy XL whatever mask. literally millions versions them. Get one solid quality reusable one put kind particle filter in. People fucking lazy say can't find mask fits even looked 2 minutes... That’s guess well downpunching? Good luck RNC. There's reason want full capacity Charlotte. Pete Ricketts refers citizens visiting government buildings ""customers."" 

I'll take ""Things I'm way shocked by"" $200, Alex splitting two jobs, working full time receiving protections benefits full time job Well punitive seems depend one ones forbidden operating business. individuals extremely punitive, lost livelihood worth even less nothing now, owe even houses live bank now. them, extremely punitive. industry deemed “essential” powers be, might consider less punitive. Like liquor stores, head shops example am. Get this. head shop town allowed stay open, food bank charity next door forced close. Never ask government de essential not.


Just many lockdown enthusiasts convinced re-opening causing sky fall feel weren’t restrict enough. reality, deaths per day Covid trending ever since mid April. never hear media. hear hot spots, never big picture. seems like fucked many people want longer shutdown feel wasn’t harsh enough. seems like every region learn hard way. first showed Europe, didn’t take seriously either. Somehow thought China messed medical system repressed communications something. lot people died countries sudden understood serious problem. US, watched Italy go lockdown tut-tutted. “Must medical system....” “What made Italians get worse?” 

But meanwhile Americans still going Italy really paying attention. “Well, it’s part I’m going planned trip year ago....” hits NYC whole country watched thousands die dismissed “city problem” “old people problem” even worse “POC problem.” they’re going learn hard way, like Europe, UK, NY metro region, Brazil. Somehow people can’t seem connect dots see behavior makes difference. say everyday live Florida. become shithole left leaning media? unless talking something like alternet going down. One day pick daughter school noticed cordon police cars road leading school. Guess first thoughts were? ""OMG please school shooting, please let child safe!"" ""give baby!!"" Turns escaped convict neighborhood (thus police cordon) ***every single parent*** 15 minutes nightmare thoughts playing heads found out. 

Anythings may impact child always issue parent loves child. mean Minnesota NY spiking right huge protests... Ya fix comment...locations taxes vary, house increased $1000 year. $300k home Oregon. Number people land hospital relevant number deaths Construction well, one job fully implemented another, everyone wears around neck acts fake news. wear half face respirator year old p-100 filters ( figure dust collected filter better, please someone correct I'm wrong) protect nobody else cares one another apparently. Haha, said done experience, I've always diagnosed flu based symptoms. I've never tested, last years would assume I've got virus stay home without going doctor it. get flu now, would absolutely try get tested flu COVID. entirely anecdotal, imagine I'm one boat. Look.. understand you’re coming frustrating taking place time you’ve finally got confidence time high, cannot control everything happens. Think way, grand view life, short term problem, problem requires change, least now. Keep exercising weight loss pick left this. It’s gone unless dead could longer operate results weren’t possible. It’s merely hold now. Try view situation different angle. Make best it’s going last forever. Every pandemic taken place beginning every century ended point another. Learn adapt and, all, keep positivity realistic. certainly hope countries control, shown able cope well, close borders countries cases rise. picked seemed like good average last 10 years so. Would 45% better number since that's around highest period? Nah. He’s gonna ignore plug ears fingers. gives whole two squirts piss happens. Funny sad reality. People think get intensive care good go. people severe problems rest lives sequelae intensive care condition put there. well, partially true. fear method control, that's true long time.

(which also tax different per location) pissed renting spoke landlord said matching 'market rates' increased $10 month... like well everyone quit raising shits giggles need increase! 

So damndest buy place within couple years get that. know markets already crazy expensive unfortunately morons said exact opposite 2 months ago? Probably sitting hospital bed. Idiots. Despite fact began 3 weeks ago. COVID takes 5 days incubate.  people already explained you, complain me? I'm saying huge hazard. Sending people jail means much higher chance getting COVID. feasible unless increasing spread. maybe thats problem giving bailouts trillions wars trillions, yet something tax payers...""sorry cannot afford"" Kind makes re-think opinions well?  definitely do. live North Florida legit gets cold (like 30 degrees). one cares coronavirus anymore. let thing get it. still can't get paper gowns. using night gowns instead. Interesting times, say least official figures, excess mortality scary.

There literally zero excess mortality euromomo 0-14 age range anywhere europe. I'm staring right now. think back bit more. People make Borat jokes whenever Kazakhstan mentioned legitimately receive capital punishment Well leader basically coming saying ""science man bad rabble rabble rabble"" wtf expect people do? Yes, need figure live covid. clear start.

Here's key though: learning live covid CANNOT mean eliminating people congregating. *Because that's people do; huge part shared humanity* I'm visiting need apartment. masks come I've washed hands back hotel even then, try get stuff delivered left look apartments. 

You bet ass I'm quarantining get back MO. people fucking reckless. that's coming Missourian lmao ever time listen science, you’d think would now. guess actually read studies cited article?

Many comparing surgical masks N95s include group wearing mask. 

Many find lower infection rates mask-wearing group.

Many found difference limited low number events. Eg, follow subjects long enough many either group get infected. 4 mask-wearing group 6 non-mask wearing group get infected, significant difference. event-rate likely low used relatively short follow-up periods conducted pandemic. 

So, actually read studies cited? read cherry-picked quotes bits data weakly applicable current situation? Texan, cannot control governor Texans do, control well follow CDC guidance (wear mask, frequent hand washing, stay home go errands, opt contactless service stay 6 ft away, avoid crowds, monitor symptoms plan). thought really comfort me. Deplorables fought keep way. Unpopular opinion: dalton 😍 Wow. $200 whole dollars! Pathetic. close NY peak

The catch peak weeks *after* locking down. guess phrased way NYC's lockdown reopening plans separate rest New York state. Either way, main issue personal health risks, main issue spreading part. dangerous path assume fine fine. use tested theories performed highly educated scientists go gut? TOTALLY makes sense. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA

HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA believe you’re getting voted asking source, brought legitimate point. I'm set spend weekend Vegas coming August, nothing reported late area gives confidence visiting. think someone who's self-defense gun would ok owning using simple defensive piece equipment also save others.  article literally fact checked distortions PM used.

But right also hide. 

It's totally untrue politicized Sweden. true politicized recently. deal Denmark say. hope change government next election, SD.

Totally agree, tbh like either V never big enough get probably. Saw article potential coalitions tbh none looked good me. Maybe better hope would internal battle faction true roots less business friendly came power. Dunno that's even thing though. Lmfaoooooooo nutcase.

Churches closed groups people small areas talking COVID time bomb. Pray own.

If Joe HRC president, graph looks like others. Everyone forgets china alright. still think protest peak. using “two weeks” it’s mostly true older populations. 

But super big pop Florida today yesterday many respondents referencing Memorial Day, 24 days ago. 

The protests Minneapolis days that, rest country 6 days Memorial Day. 

So, protest spike, I’m looking Seattle, much way Memorial Day - still locked fairly hard, much way reopening, pretty fiery, dense protesting 19 days ago. So, happens, we’re looking June 23-24. 

I really hope I’m wrong. would lovely news marching bands, choirs, contact sports, outdoor classrooms. far virus given us little reason think group activities safe. know, right? kind terrifying. enjoying living arizona right now... atleast I'm able stay home every day! I'm afraid near future. Im starting feel like feeling like February lol anger people complete morons. Currently yes. talking about, take current case totals extrapolate daily new-case counts, based past-14-day averages. ran calcs, NY adding ~800 new cases per day average, CA adding ~2700. given enough time (as in, months) CA surpass NY agree. Especially 20-40 age range ticks off, big difference.

That’s sources sorted :/ NYC, announced lowest positivity rate ever 1% 40,000 tests. pandemic began. People fed up, take another dosis fear. comes real reason afraid cautious, everyone explodes. ahhh BLM protests ok? I'm saying find ways enjoy it. know experience women horribly unfulfilled. thing made happy pretty starts fade nothing left. Sounds like President people smart. Californians irresponsible seems. took drive Saturday right Memorial Day would believe crowds. People acting like nothing wrong, crowding streets eating food. saw little mask usage. probably drove across 4 counties day thing every one. 

That day started feel crazy taking virus seriously. It’s downhill ever since then. 
Fortunately people stores polite masks on. Restaurants open required wear mask sit down. free take spread germs everywhere. Gyms open dystopian plastic looking workout cubes aren’t fully enclosed really knows often they’re sanitizing things. trying way hard open opposite. I’m guessing high numbers Memorial Day weekend protesting, oh boy I’ve seen people get relaxed wearing masks distancing. Trump means “dying out”? Disney onsite manufacturing facilities produce almost everything used parks chocolate wafer Cinderella ice cream cone trash cans guardrails. surprised taken last months produce line Frozen 2 Toy Story N95 masks. Public health department said backlog. see spikes everywhere, spikes already trending protests started, much tied reopening early. need look spikes started, top it. MIT announced won’t allow students campus fall. pretty sure “EPA approved” doesn’t mean thing used really rolling dice restrictions simple thing stops spread virus.

Masks. got back Myrtle Beach yesterday wasn’t locked really. Holy shit Well, least freedom. Well yeah...Italy went lockdown florida lockdown significantly stricter. funeral..... people like reason spreads. funeral peoples funeral may lived full life dieing conditions. Fucking selfish ass motherfuckers. Yeah. think nailed it, though. initial fear spring break. time fair scared specific beach crowd subsequent traveling back home spread.

It dismissed youngsters time (accidentally correctly), people reacted pushback insisting beaches terrible. Shut up. They're reopening protest unrest. behaved we'd probably still phase 1 july like Gov originally suggested. idea edit title, help please. Colorado already contained coronavirus, little doubt northeast well. we're going tourists places didn't.

If cut hours least overall pay people quit, company also keep everyone part time work low hours means need provide health insurance

Save lives lol. Actually, expensive NJ towns, 100% true COVID. can't even imagine true now. There's little pricing room over, say, 1.25 million. live fairly affluent town still range prices, there's enough buyers payments credit $850k+ homes. one house town started near $6 million eventually sell closer $3 two years market. homes we're 1.75-2 million two years ago lucky find people 1.1-1.4 they'll always sit while.

Also, went buying house last summer, mortgage company many times tried pull bullshit wife I, weird hoop jumping last second I'd already told available cause work extremely deadline driven industry (tv) shows right air, xyz last forms statements letters whatever they'd asking otherwise pick phone next time could kiss whole sale goodbye. hated (and still hate) way underwriters operate sheer level fuckery incompetence that, that, ""forgot ask"" something, asked three times it'd already given me, means show air millions ad revenue debate I'll never work again. 

Not giving single fuck sale went cause keeping job order pay eventual mortgage really helped dealing shenanigans I'd warned about. Several times made alternative arrangements simply waited got home 1am send umpteenth copy fucking bank statement.

My point say - underwriters banks quickly becoming ones barrel chasing yield housing market. I'm millennial, share distaste lack giving shit American home buying myths. simply enough buyers anymore expensive houses built market already begun reflect this.

That said - believe already see mass exodus happening cities locked hard, NY all.

I'm across river Capitol Hill I'm probably leaving place apartments looked February 2019 significantly cheaper per month offering free rent 1-2 months. Doctors public health experts also criticized way researchers shared results public.


Instead releasing alongside peer-reviewed paper even draft, summarized results press release. scientists behind trial said wanted get information results soon possible, without publishing data, it’s impossible scientists carefully review them. Observers puzzled research team didn’t include robust information.


For instance, clinicians like Faust want know demographics trial group, medications patients using, researchers set thresholds severe illness. Doctors need information understand dexamethasone play patients.


“As observer, it’s frustrating piece information available [about lowered fatality rates dexamethasone], also lot information could also share,” Faust said. “Right now, it’s impossible know patient front me, whether patient front matches typical patient described trial.” Oh they're 100% fudging numbers. end (somewhat) reliable metric excess deaths historical averages. Lack comprehensive testing also obfuscates actual mortality rate, 0.1% could wildly off.

Without vaccine something like steroid treatment turning effective herd immunity scenario stop (since Americans can't handle lockdowns), various shades bad terrible catastrophic.

0.1% *very* optimistic. says globally, 3.4% reported COVID-19 cases died. could factor 10, herd immunity could achieved 80%, would still almost 900k U.S. deaths. say ­Beijing has, past, written interest-free loans extended African nations, accounted less 5 per cent Africa’s total financial debt China, rest covered concessional commercial loans.

Pretty big caveat there. amounts forgiven millions tens millions. full amounts owed hundreds China Africa Research Initiative Johns Hopkins University School Advanced International Studies Washington indicate country advanced US$143 billion 49 African governments state-owned companies 2000 2017.

That's average 8.5 billion annually.

??????????????????????????? Well probably told working keep license 15 hours month made choice long time ago could stay home kids wanted did. wanted stay help people, stories told people running hospital horrible. couldn’t get trained proper PPE handling day went one staff train her. people supposed work shifts see covid patients last leave specific door come back main area. Well didn’t happen staff would pick food trays covid patients without PPE on. head doctor even photographed corona tests drive clinic site without PPE on. made front page paper told staff couldn’t talk anyone. So, yeah, total shit show basically worth risk family part time gig. Paying rent contractual obligations, really fit analogy, since got contract will.

Seatbelt laws protect others driving, I'd argue seatbelt laws primarily enforced way police stop question - certainly infringement freedom.

The bacon analogy bad... eat much bacon want, there's laws mesh. oh, forgot subreddit owned china 😂 always possibility, don’t know enough virus yet Black lives matter! Im Los Angeles, Hollywood Hills. pay 1500 room Good!

Data pretty clear one worse other. sub used interesting follow, information various developments fighting virus, new knowledge yes, sadly, new outbreaks progress that. 95% contents masks. Even seemingly unrelated post, top comments masks. discussion measures immediately turns ""are wearing masks it?"". Mask holy savior.

If research suggesting masks effectiveness... no, plenty others, suggesting thing. Consumer Price Indexing CoL calculations accounts recreational products goods services like insurance.

Car, Rental Pet insurance definitely adjust location. moved miles closer urban area zip code change made car insurance premiums jump 10%. groceries, $5 visit, like 10% more. years ago moved smaller town here, astounded much week groceries costing me. 

Maro stable prices luxuries like video games, online subscriptions, stuff sot prices. that's exception, norm.

 Proper lockdowns masks work, simple. Source: live Spain. don’t many Fox News viewers North OC. Yep. Another NYC-level crisis. many people thought hilarious suggested experienced NYC possible elsewhere “we empty hospital beds enough PPE” concept fact helps patient load stays levels  plenty equipment, beds, PPE, etc NY back January/February “what happened Italy could NEVER happen — much better prepared” attitude exactly nearly completely buried health system. much US engineering controls (e.g. plexiglass, obstacles enforce distancing prevent droplet exchange)? Clears throat........duh. sentence... like lot. 

""Asymmetric"" - perfect description opposite ""but sides"". think depends state. I’d say see PA like 90%+ masks public besides parks gave away masks people would’ve hated “using campaign publicity” didn’t they’d reaction now.

The truth decision major isn’t Trumps choice didn’t matter did. gonna outcome. HIV completely different beast virus SARS-CoV-2. several potential vaccines going various stages trials showing promise. think likely we'll get vaccine. big question long take widely available. Lol !  America !

Yeah, Twitter mobs could use quote ingrained brains.  Difficult understand irresponsible people be. Also guy got new evidence revised earlier advice America ""experts"" listened gotten right? social ones encouraging protests? economic ones gladly pumped inflation directly economy evaporated consumer spending? medical ones told us wear masks? planning experts failed get testing capacity PPE supply? international experts lied world?

Tell me, United States, class experts got right?

Well told week boss got put 14 day quarentine since people church now. laid everyone around found also sent memo require masks everywhere building said guess put health department shows up.

I hope takes seriously rest time going forward. Could *please* realize since Sweden reporting recoveries, ""active cases"" number Sweden completely wrong? UK, they're reporting either.

If check ""recoveries"" graph, Sweden UK 0 recoveries. think number true? think that, magically, people infected Sweden UK never get better? single one?

Since data wrong, *you* option displaying bullshit graph, graph, choice display bullshit graph. Please don't. spreading bullshit. route sixty mile radius location, counts No. ask excessively drunk person leave bar, ask disruptive person leave library, ask smoking person leave restaurant. here. trouble, call cops. businesses arent fined, one enforce anything.

In fact, that's worked smoking: restaurants fined, smokers. Sizing problem right 6 y/o 3 y/o. Massively overblown they're going. Yeah it’s getting you-go-outside-you-die hot. take can’t wear mask eat. AZ eating really risky, wouldnt surprised restaurants alone putting big spike numbers. groveled Trump got PPE hospitals.

Enforced cities counties, choose enforce it. action really nothing except make Newsom look like something, really change anything. Also, one tell guy Whole foods anything, refuse check wont able purchase anything. wear mask.

Simply put, longer trust them.

They told us ""do wear mask"" ""14 days flatten curve hospital overwhelmed.""

They lied.

Why start believing now?

I wear mask ""fuck them"" why. allowed 1000+ people gather vs like 10 ya., mask gonna anything point.. herd immunity America’s way right now. mean din't give trillions billionaires. gave people things would ok.  me, someone 50 I'm worried spreading someone. I'm even around old people unless I'm grocery store, I'm even concerned spreading stranger, even family member. annoying go grocery store see old people wearing masks properly, stopping long conversation staff without care world like... geez... 100,000 people showing 20,000 person venue roast hot Oklahoma sun?

I can't honestly tell estimates sincere ploy draw counter protesters order spark incident.

I can't believe they'd many supporters show up, midst Trump holding rally, local officials allowing gatherings anywhere near size, people really quite stupid show it.

I agree completely. selectively enforcing rules, though.  think tried voluntary approach fend cries ""government overreach"", happened anyway work, use mandate. Funny people vehemently lockdown refuse absolute simplest fucking thing could help prevent another one. Indoor outdoor? American

E: Repost, political.  I'm protests conventions. supporting one shaming like left makes massive hypocrite. Duh....they testing more! part can’t understand?  /s Civil War II result. Maybe old scores previous one could settled time well? Yeah mean shit thousands tickets issued, including people covering nose.

And since thousands tickets going issued, mean shit. I'm that. seen family friends since started I'm definitely risking anyone's health seeing them. way things going. It’s still there. Wear masks. Wash/sanitize hands often. Socially distance. professionally marketed national PSA campaign. though? Sweden took extremely risky gamble. counted reaching herd immunity quickly. Swedish strategy failed completely, sacrificed many human lives senselessly, hope human sacrifice benefit Swedish economy also vain, Swedish economy predicted contract similar degree many European countries (if death infection numbers remain high recent weeks, overall negative economic impact Sweden probably worse European countries).

At least, Sweden, enough decency admit failed countries value citizens‘ lives health must restrict entry Swedish people. make ridiculous claims reasonable measures COVID-19 spreading Sweden, completely control, European countries mostly managed get cases relatively low levels „discriminatory“ demand countries gamble population completely opening border wih Sweden, means Sweden‘s reputation permanently damaged.

I used high opinion Sweden, shame become country. least, Swedish citizens forced Lövfen Tegnell step bad consequences irresponsible policies cannot denied more, part Sweden‘s honour might saved. But, although criticism, Swedish conformism unwarranted blind trust government still dominate. problem encompasses Swedish government large part Swedish society. current moment, cannot count much rationality Sweden, countries must keep travel restrictions Sweden ignore Swedish claims „discriminatory“ countries respect people‘s lives health.

I suppose damage Tegnell Lövfen wrought Sweden, terms deaths, permanent organ damages, lasting loss reputation Sweden far greater people estimate now. Surprised Georgia let one go. Gov win guess people really like guy ignored him. mean people problems masks ones approve Trump. obviously base belief system reality. One good things virus seeing people deliver packages shady cars. used see lot happened, care scan package prove steal it. still shady see random dude pull up, crossing guard vest, drop package old ass car. 

Also, next zero robo-calls scam callers (but betting return vengeance vaccine perspective countries.) love L1bertarians.

The intellectually dishonest people planet.

How indoor rally safer protest outside current data points circulated air indoor environment much effective likely transmit COVID 19 outside, humid one also exposed UV Light?

Or forget President* wanted shine UV light inside people kill virus?

Also, safe, folks sign liability waivers go case catch COVID, campaign handing masks?

Lastly, lets compare significance protests value purpose effect change country make better, safer place diverse citizenship, campaign rally whose purpose feed ego wounded sociopathic narcissist.

Whitmer protested solidarity believe change needed police communities give support help end systemic racism government (state, federal, local) believes exists.

She charge ""police"", power State Police Dept. Michigan.

But know else charge state?

Don't money lose /r/WSB? Epicenter what? Lol see ya Destin next week! 1\. Ask questions. don’t care dumb. questions ask, better get asking questions. 

I love dumb questions! wield great deal power, take advantage often can. 

For example initial weeks project ask really dumb questions without people treating like idiot. Dumb questions allow quickly;

* Learn actually knows who's bullshitting. (If really understand doing, ELI5 that. bluster give bad information, -- personality problems.)

* compare formal documents people project formally supposed ... see gaps either need 2\. Express yourself. Hopefully asking good questions. 

A good question difficult put together. Here's best example reporter knew ask good focused questions;

* topic (anti-abortion protesters) focus questions asked reporter follow questions asks.) could incredible spectacle Trump encourages people wear masks. Lol. Asking voluntary quarantine look like care already know actually it. America arrogant country Earth Exponentials commonly covered certain school districts seems. That's goal. r/Masks4All &lt;3 r/cfs? pandemic given major flare i've found really great tips manage better blame people confused. blame governor communicating. Confusion removed clear repeated communication. Michael Servetus, Hypatia, Giordano Bruno, Kazimierz Lyszczynsk, Girolamo Cardano, Cecco d' Ascoli, Pietro d' Abano, Roger Bacon- names two things common Dr Fauci. think it’s going end time soon. People already talking conspiracy theories Mars it’s going end even relocate Mars. So, think answer US higher threshold systemic violence.

We value ""freedom"" ""saving lives."" evident every aspect culture value system.

So, even people admit lockdown saves lives, they're coming place anything extraordinary save lives.

Our news media love running stories overcoming hardship survival valued aid public goods.

Just look health care system. We're lose waivers protecting lot folks trying burden cost million dollar hospital bill.

Suicides always spike significant medical debt often people put care due medical debt. awhile now. mandatory masks. actually huge, global collaborations occurring scientific community right try understand various aspects virus. Science actually pretty collaborative general. 
One issues rarely speak definitive terms, particularly cases many unknowns. hand, media does. could say may happen like game telephone turns happen.
Many scientists also work hard get science understandable. fact, give presentations assume one background knowledge. Every paper written, provide layman's terms abstract. 
I think issue lack science literacy desire read headlines dig deeper. 
 Yes, opportunists sciences, like field rule. Supposing brought light inside body though? cremation done, there's nothing investigate 😢 100,000 people showing 20,000 person venue roast hot Oklahoma sun? Trump holding rally, local officials allowing gatherings anywhere near size, people really quite stupid show it. also said infected people (implying asymptomatic spreaders well

Hold up. something really wrong took least month reverse stance masks rapid-spreading pandemic, assuming correct implied asymptotic spreaders March 8th video interview. Based assumption, basically recommended masks even though knew people spread asymptomatically. Fauci omniscient. gave best answer could information time.

In case, give best answer could information (asymptomatic spreaders) Saying someone lied changed position based new information absolutely ridiculous.

What said beginning post implying asymptomatic spreaders pretty much meant change position immediately based new information, lied carried original faulty position least month later. We’re going culture victory, there’s much unhappiness point going science tree It’s really good news. Unfortunately it’s terrible news. 

People discuss means virus weaker there’s assumption asymptotic means people spared health consequences covid19. fact asymptotic people necessarily spared high degree asymptotic people suggests covid bypassing immune systems. It’s good all. 

There’s much one knows virus it’s ultimately pointless making predictions. It’s anti-science bias, it’s non-peer reviewed science bias. shit isn’t reviewed, it’s trash. they’ve redacting every previous studies wrong. Wrong incubation period, contagious period, drug response, even 80% false positive rate first round RT-PCR diagnostic primers. Terrible science people.

Fill state coffers 301 highly misleading, graphs show couple countries

see: Sweden #16 cases per million, #11 remove countries less 1million inhabitants.

Top 10 confirmed cases per million (countries 1m):

1. Qatar

3. Chile (my country.. fuck)
4. Kuwait
5. Peru
6. Singapore
7. USA
8. Armenia
9. Spain
10. Belarus
11. Sweden

What may interesting 3 countries considered ""developed"", Sweden much worse Scandinavian siblings without much effort tests neither (probably cases highly reported). USA give fuck apparently, Spain got fast. 

The rests know much measures. Peru strict lockdown since like 3 months now, material needs whatever government tries apparently, lot informal work people without access bank accounts etc. Chile tried flexible lockdown failed miserably shit went control

Public health isn’t field personal health. used hear everyone too. wanted work while, opportunities first. maybe upon time good workplace (at least ones area), currently terrible. Hell yeah Hospitalizations rising many states United States, Dr. Fauci said last week thinks states seeing increased hospitalizations rethink reopening.

But hard tell much increase hospitalizations patients hospitalized longer versus patients admitted. many states, home state North Carolina, metric tracked many patients currently hospitalized, know many admitted discharged. states like Arizona track number patients admitted Covid-19 number remained steady, even though hospitalizations also increasing. suggests hospitalization increase caused patients hospitalized longer patients admitted.

Why would Covid-19 patients hospitalized longer? Maybe doctors treatment options. Maybe hospitals waiting see mild cases develop serious cases (serious complications typically develop within 5-7 days I've read). Maybe there's change related hospital insurance procedures. Maybe patients surviving dying (could hospitalizations rising slightly actually good news?) speculation, without better data there's way know.

It seems looking number people currently hospitalized Covid-19 provide much information, need granular data make educated decision. Thoughts? Based statistic?

So asians wear mask nyc made mask usage mandatory means previous infection happened 5-14 days went down?

Seriously article way try account factor durrr masks good, increased immunity? rate infection going anyway before(and reason so)?

PS. look good beard.  US lockdown month. numbers rose drastically, locked down. fell plateau, reopened, lifted mask requirements, going back up. seems pretty simple cause effect thing, no? 

I would love things normal, best case scenario mitigation kills 2 million Americans. Realistically, without mitigation, many would die, like happening Arizona, hospitals full, CFR treatment much worse. 

And I'll cut every death geriatric 6 months live, 40,000, 25% USA deaths *are* nursing homes, far largest single group. makes **75%** deaths *are not* end life patients. 

Side note, read things sound dumb. Hong Kong Taiwan operate government independently China. CCP numbers include them, include CCP numbers. working Target worse getting severe injury homeless?

Good point, value land location. jobs amenities dry up, value. Let's tell astroid going hit earth give tickets 'first' colony generation ship.

I've read ancestors got first place. messed up. Yet another reason laws police need fixed. People getting arrested get roll dice death permanent lung damage. I’ve seen convincing study proving masks help social settings. Everyone assumes help science lover prefer see actual real world testing. That’s way roll. I’m especially skeptical since virus like 5 microns across, easily fit fibers random mask. probably authorities everywhere claimed mess masks  Here’s one: belt. understand masks big issue country. Ah yes, Chinese math 2+2=4 opposed American math 2+2= whatever Trump wants think. speaking absolute numbers. irrelevant except rear-view mirror history. Texas never really got cases per day control way many neighboring states did, compared them, spread much, much sustained. Look LA example.

Deaths relevant unlike cases, know mostly deaths COVID. Cases rising could new tests.

Hospitalizations even bit deceiving. heard people going routine surgeries, testing positive covid, symptoms, getting considered ""covid hospitalization"". several states including Texas started clamp reporting deaths COVID-19 due say concerns regarding verification. words, much stricter reporting death COVID-19 related, even person disease died condition typically associated disease, positive shockingly, policy implemented, states saw decreased death rates (but deaths reporting since rise, including Texas good week last week, generally rise week).

I'll need see proof this. warned you. Lol Tulsa Ok.

The Klandemic going Saturday. Also state epidemiologist Anders Tegnell surprised slow covid spreading(Progress). However, defenders say plan herd immunity. Yup, half masked yesterday forget 2 drops rain nobody knows drive sudden. Accidents freeway everywhere. way everything else. Guns guns.

But no, seriously national guard hold borders infection rates sky rocketing population highest. Duh. 

It wont conpletely stop border crossing, need semis supplies get through, heavily limit people needlessly moving around shouldnt.

When mayor proposed requiring businesses enforce it, even governor said got right. mandating worn anywhere outside far. What, like physical document? text document, electronic form.

Like Californians different species everyone else tried reopening recently. every state fucking repeat experiment? ironic part many pro-life anti-maskers adopted popular slogan associated pro-choice movement:

“My body, choice!” I've seen percentage people tested positive *attended* protests lower people *not* attended protests. attended protest mean *contracted* covid protest seen contact tracing stats released got it.

The way interpret that, then, attended protests correlates *lower average* risk contracting covid. *nothing* point fact protests dangerous fact would point towards outdoor protesting *safer* alternative whatever general population spending time doing. plagiarized fam

Imprisonment? must joking. American 🙄 trust people Facebook IG? thats sad part stuck rock hard place. Open economy - death. shut - death.

Sounds like point full steam ahead fuck get back business pray arent sacrifice.... Nah, mate. Can’t stay forever.
Taking small measured risks.
As always, dangerous part trip drivers. Might wait there’s new administration, sadly. yes think continue problem throughout. Except that’s true. two weeks ago. look numbers every day. America registering like 15-17k cases down. last several weeks I’ve watched climb past 20k day past 25k day.

You either straight lying haven’t actually looking numbers last two weeks. bad! think 10x number misleading isnt sourced. rest opinion piece makes good points political economic perspective. Would support ban driving then? puts people risk well. Pedestrians, motorists.  Plenty people knew would e police. one took/takes seriously. science reverses every days door opened anything else stable, even thing based nothing consistent. science tells something scary, automatically wrong head?  insults love ""mouth-breather"" things listed contagious. Cuomo earlier said Florida limit travelers New York, he's wanting limit travelers Florida.

Cuomo earlier said cranking 90s way play game, he's cranking fucking 90s.   make "" mandatory"", KY, much want. ""muh rights"" = non-compliance. Start citing fining selfish pricks, compliance go up.  homework, I'm going argue data get yourself. Go read study. give constitution crap

Ok......so propose mandating something blatantly illegal then? California's rise cases likely due increased testing. % test positive rate remained around 4.5%. states like TX, FL, AZ increase cases increase %test positivity rate, implies rise due greater community spread increased testing. would never know reading news, US flatten curves. Go worldometer look daily deaths. trending steady since Mid April. 

While everyone lambasting Florida spring break opening early, time, fewer deaths per capita Denmark, lauded international community response. population density. never adopted masks, recommended 3 ft physical distancing. Half ours. get riled half don’t wear masks outdoors. live 100 percent mask-wearing inside stores like wal mart, Home Depot, grocery stores, etc. Denmark nobody wears masks everyone thinks wise. must constantly berate Americans? Oh yeah! Already 6,1% antibodies 9 worst hit regions according todays press conference.

We reach herd immunity already around summer 2023 neighbors longer laughing us! 

Norway example reach herd immunity year 2100!  Call health department least? spread word can? state I’m roughly 1700 cases yet completed 660,000 tests, find US response unfathomable. 16 new cases whole state yesterday people freaking out. wonder US dept veterans affairs fucked wankers like Rajiv

Rajiv like “we thought would kill whole planet. Turns it’s even tenth bad 6 months” true leader orange tongue. Weed idiots voting actually works. Doctor Boomer says masks bad health make breathe CO2 breath. pool possible infections smaller mean ""it cannot infect many new people did"" first time around. cherry-picked, literally worst-case scenario neighborhoods NYC, sure. places US, amount people infected SMALL SMALL SMALL percentage total population. world would make difference place like Los Angeles, example, 77,000 infections city 4 MILLION.

A second wave could easily surpass 77k infections, would 1.2% population antibodies make difference all?

Not mention phrase 'second wave' disingenuous best. 
For first wave end actually numbers go linear scale. anything deaths plateaued (in LA example) caveat: within given period time, longer term effects unknown.  ""But drink home, might beat shit family. Checkmate, liberals."" Oops forgot that's Sweden lol Yes - reuse masks. let sit sun use. 2 N95s, 6 KN95s, 10 surgical masks, 5 homemade masks HEPA vacuum bags. rotate around frequently.

Two weeks afterwards people blame protests. votes cool pretty much back up. Keep 'em coming kids! still lie walked back, since Fauci's interview seem widely known.  is, extent, mask protects wearer.     
First, said need masks. Then, said need masks prevent spread asymptomatic carriers people.  But, saying masks protects wearer *from* asymptomatic carriers.    
The interview here:         
*""But also, protect certain degree, hundred percent, protecting getting infected someone who, either breathing, coughing, sneezing, singing whatever droplets aerosols go out. masks work.""*     
The interesting part is, 100%. brings another issue table, ""infectious dose"". concept says less viral material ingested, lesser resulting illness be. There's thing ""bonus tax rate"". 100 days? Feels longer. Also I'm sure large protests taking place across state contributed it. medicine. But, wearing mask right I'm getting near you... need come hard people don’t. Set examples. Public indoors reason can’t put mask 20 minutes store expect man-baby joke. fuck sees wearing mask weakness defies intellect. look I’m talking about! trump intellect? LOL! yeah man, 3 months since first test common sense started.

Common sense would said: ""Everyone continue wear masks due covid-19"" But.. tinfoil made?! test actually made genuine foils?! know tricks man, stop trying fight it. thing is, cloth masks don’t tell means angry it, wear mask it. Thank brought plagiarism source attention.

I've taken melatonin years help sleep, recently learned powers. knew sleep benefits, little potent antioxidant, recently learned melatonin immunomodulator (something helps regulate balance immune system responds pathogens... 1. over-reacting, 2. under-reacting, 3. getting right).

With Covid-19, small group perfectly healthy people getting sick dying immune system overreacts virus. called cytokine release syndrome, aka cytokine storm. immuno-modulator help.

It mentioned ""over-reaction"" happens time people many different reasons many different triggers. ever allergies, that's is.. instead mild allergic reaction, like anaphylactic shock.

I'm gonna stop writing I'll never finish this.. :) anyways, articles...

Papers articles Melatonin's immunomodulatory effects, including one possible importance fighting Covid-19.

1. **Immunomodulation Melatonin: Significance Seasonally Occurring Diseases:** **Melatonin Immunomodulation: Connections Potential Clinical Applications:** **COVID-19: Melatonin potential adjuvant treatment:** agree r/iamverybadass comment replying to, evidence masks anything all. Fauci said wear optics month ago. think people 50 think going die. myself, worry possible long term health problems. Lung kidney damage seen even people preexisting conditions. Plus single parent worry take care kid month sick (which long one friends age sick. went hospital week 3). worry spreading someone vulnerable. 

Older people freaking get sick seen many news articles older people wishing taken seriously infected. Yes life risks mean take reasonable precautions. smoke alarms, wear seat belt, wear mask public.  lot Americans wouldn’t believe anyway. We’re stupid country taught rebellious important intelligence you’re rebelling against.

People blame Fauci whoever else want, Americans weren’t going wear masks anyway. We’re damn stupid backwards country. ultimate point enough, figure way out. get point, something it. levels BS can/will tolerate. smoking crack think know physicist quauntum mechanics,, doctor health climatologist climate.

Hopefully spike large either. gyms August bay? source this? believe impression would happen within weeks least next month. I'm kind buying conspiracy he's already antibody injections survivors.

I'm gonna keep wearing mine staying away people much can.  BLM protestors wear masks.

The protests happen outdoors.

The number people protests FL **drop bucket** compared fact state “business usual” weeks. 

If want bag Black Lives Matter protestors, admit that, least find state isn’t known ending lockdown WAY EARLY. government employers seem disagree you. Looks like college days... said news referring OP article. shows Florida fucked. guess understand using redditor's comment spin actual news article shows Florida fucked. reading rant starts make sense. I’m Mission Beach. would say 1 mask per every 50 people saw weekend. paper anti-science America. roots psychology it?

Any experts recommend good read?  Protests recent. 4-6 weeks need past see effect was. Abbott asking Texans wear masks akin admitting Covid ravaging it’s citizens. Admitting means there’s reason people lock drive work. Lockdown would mean economic slump, especially oil industry. 

Expecting Abbott tell people wear masks like expecting oil industry tell people drive electric cars. models correctly predicted headed so... go back lockdown? want get infected, people way selfish. IFR NYC indicator, 1.4%, ‘rona x14 deadly influenza .1% US. it’s super fucking duper way would go that. Borderline negligent hold wedding ask me... get this, I'd also argue fight deadly threats time without massive public gatherings. require reciprocity though... everyone except Beijing

and Wuhan, Shulan, Jilin, ...

whack mole Sad face. go visit Universal Studios now? Coronavirus Schmoronavirus. I'm tired malicious microscopic miscreant. wish would fuck outta already.

In fact, many afraid virus virus stupid even literally one actual brain cell. stupid little virus brainlet knows virus.  even gone viral, made virus viral haha. 

This Covid-ninedumbass even know besides virally infecting shit order make itself.  can't believe getting away easily! dare invisible bastard ruin whole shit!!

Infectious diseases suck sanitation device learned best. There's big difference delegating abdicating. read positives/true negatives come days exposure. feel like reputable source - chance got beforehand? I've several protests tested negative week later, said pretty much everyone else wearing mask, doubt helped.
Hopefully lockdown second wave drastic since ppe &amp; testing, god, knows. Yeah lots far right wing dip shits there. big chance coronavirus made lab Thoughts prayers foils made China. stand chance. Yes, ""science profit"" bias. Sorry: Fauci screw pooch: face covering better none. damn bandanna better nothing. could said that, asked public scarf (hah!) actual medical masks. random sample, heavily biased towards health care workers. place anywhere close 57% antibodies. Articles seemed misrepresent expert quoting push ""we've already got herd immunity lets open up"" agenda. Dammit beat it. Almost focusing resources nursing homes long term care instead moronic blanket lockdowns trying scare general public thinking virus dangerous health real?

You seems confused nature dear.  Interesting. Sars one mers, coronaviruses, seem produce immune system long lasting antibodies. However, common cold sort immune response. Granted, colds coronaviruses, probably it’s easy catch cold every year. money vs lives comparing, lives vs lives. question getting right balance lose least possible amount lives. much focus economy much focus virus either one dangerous.

I agree finding balance, long run people get sick debilitated end increasing debt due broken system, exactly living comfotable lives. I've seen places put much reopening versus safety. understand reopening, least make effort protect employees compensate them. US shutdown correctly month, would contained now. companies got LOAN, got money. companies got 1 months expenses per company, got half month. People say said people understand actual numbers economics. problem emotional reasoning. folks basing judgement feels instead reals position ignorance reasonably expected outcome ignorance

While true still excuse fact companies got loans didnt even need them. people still waiting stimulus checks still gotten unemployment. emotional reasoning. lot people statistically struggling effects economy directly said. Also discussion. position ignorance. differing opinion. understand whats stake sides, also know system exactly set favor. also made can't sue businesses malpractice pandemic. economy truly lives, whose lives concerned about? 

P.S: genuinely mean disparage you. enjoy debate. Please, inform may wrong. make good points. death rate increasing, though - perhaps due increase testing. resubmitting last post removed since didnt use exact title article. 

This useful info people who's employers re-opening: allowed work part time still get unemployment benefits (Including extra $600!). website table showing part-time work unemployment eligibility state. Many us getting called back work reduced hours states reoprning Covid19 Yeah lift lockdown! Im sure going work great americans. lie. beginning countries trying figure masks helped/didn't help later based new information countries tried way lower numbers learned works. confused lying is. Lying Trump knows bad pandemic months hand, says big deal hides info GOP colleagues could sell stocks cash market crashed, pretend hoax right get away anymore still pretend liberal hoax unto today. lying looks like. Learn difference. Taking criticism hard people. probably dry air AC. virus likes cool dry weather. That's one reasons hit meat packing plants badly barely touched Thailand. Interesting! Thanks links Agreed, that's kids need learn art ask right questions seek information knowledge. full-grown man-child like Rogan ""asks questions"" arent designed knowledge. essence moronic conspiracy theorists try undermine progress. support politician rally bad... people think valid point? 

If New England wasn’t included United States numbers death/mil practically Canada’s level people generally agree Canada well. 

If anything shows horrible areas specific region US skews numbers degree. But, but, but... We're AMERICANS. Bad things happen us! solution designate small number nursing homes strictly COVID+ patients. test negative, go back regular nursing home. basement blogger claims PhD biophysics trusted, he's got incentive lie.

On unrelated note, buy vitamins make live longer. Link I'd say .01 away would considered ""comparably developed"".

Maybe werent trying imply anything, quite common people inconsistent standards, WANT particular place (in case, US) considered worse is. use HDI uses - 0.9 considered ""highly developed"". Population 6 I'm glad able recover mild symptoms. studies showing even people mild symptoms complications fought infection. clinical test assume seem reinfection virus far, many common coronaviruses cause common cold reinfect someone little 6 months clearing virus. MERS SARS hand show antibodies years infection. know long antibodies last virus virus around long enough us know long term immunity. (Sorry, add flair mobile web-page. flair Sweden)

Wow South Carolina 987 new cases, 14.4% tests positive Hey man, wanted let know give shit think life. someone grew “the south,” it’s viewed like this: 

Louisiana, Arkansas, Mississippi, Alabama, Tennessee, Georgia, North South Carolina. 

Not even Kentucky Virginia would referred “the south” I’m from. 

Florida viewed “the south.” It’s basically New York south. I’m sure why, even makes sense. 

Texas thing, West South. 

Don’t know makes sense, southerners probably understand it. heard helmets? Plus cheaper still invite friends drink back porch whatever prefer. Las Vegas open? ""that's point, could lead shortage masks people really need them"".

Plus, he's walked back hundred times since. medical experts told virus woke racism somehow kills 120k 4 months. totally agree. I'm sure they'll enforce counts.... public transport, businesses... etc. comes brass tax... they're usually pretty lax.

I hope though 🤞 NYC also 20% immunity. goes long way preventing spread. Herd immunity specialists like Sweden love this... Yep. told couldn’t travel home weekend Father’s Day (my dad suffering stage IV esophageal cancer) ill put mandatory two week quarantine allowed start work time. Life sucks lol 'so admit lied me, understandable reasons. think I'll trust on, though.'

My dad told growing catch someone lying you, person liar, treat everything tell such.

I zero confidence leadership, scientists employ anyone trusts them.

I see dark days ahead us, worst part preventable. Yeah okay suffocate! majority lifetime immunity viruses antibodies shortlived coronaviruses fall category already bringing 1 2-year protections. I’m Northwest Ohio think picked Cuyahoga County days first positive case announced Ohio. even looked number protestors wearing masks?

Why use CaPs LiKe ThAt? aren’t stores enforcing mask rules, would they? might deter potential customer entering would rather risk exposure everyone working there. least job they’re letting customers back inside aren’t requiring wear masks, incredibly stupid doctors appointment today nurse practitioner I’ve never seen literally moved mask nose walked room. like UM PLEASE PUT BACK ON!? comments might coming people who've already experiencing though. started calm, logical trying educational came folks wearing masks. verbally (and occasionally physically) attacked people, see bare-faced individuals public monsters. blatant disregard others safety, also active disrespect towards people's personal choices. dont calm educational anymore, see futile effort puts danger. curve"" never mean one-time thing

Why? thread declaring bankruptcy? dont see problem, unless soylent green plant closed... Exactly this. Even compare what's happening Orange County CA governor today Arizona. 

Orange County refused wear masks. Local politicians listen voters state came said fuck guys. state requires masks statewide. 

Meanwhile Arizona governor letting local munis handle it, shifts blame locals. basically issue small sample size. 

That really apply country millions peoplel like Sweden, though. people city (la county) wear mask public places, bars/restaurants full again. There’s solid percentage people don’t care ruin everyone. locked early pretty muted wave. YouTube AMAZING health advice yall. learned cure cancer lemon water combine sunshine lavender oil 🤣🤦🏻‍♀️ *the comment read sarcasm * suggest act advisory agent collects/performs research.

I think national governments best know handle crisis like since nations different different tools, resources, even moral values. people making decicions elected officials therefore held account people. (Also prepared) 

Kinda like works today. would like hear ECDC could done better overall. might good decicion person group top made right call...or could go hell Tegnell it’s head. decicion might right would prioritize economy...worse others would tend prioritize low death toll. None would held account either way. Tempe Arizona reinstated masks. Mayors control making decision. NYC one worst hit places OP talking about. talking rural states low numbers infections opening back up. Also maybe numbers date NY state 14% last checked NYC like 20%.

SoCal? beach pretty nice look tho let's see. old ppl + people lower end human evolution = duh Plenty morons sadly. don’t know many people I’ve tell it’s conspiracy. work bar &amp; fight coworker let people sit bar itself, 2-3 feet work &amp; drinks made, “that’s want do.” Yeah meant that’s why, even though I’m comfortable personal risk 22-year-old, recognize importance wearing mask places like grocery stores pharmacies elderly may forced go. concerned increase, partly California many people. absolute numbers high, percentages aren’t alarming. 7-day trend California shows 15% increase, compared 122% Florida percent positive tests California flatter (4-5%) rise attributed increased testing. percent positive tests Florida (7%) Arizona (16%) increasing. would (sorry maybe bad english) prefilter company. breathing goes hard would first change prefilter improvised prefilter. biggest concern would atm mold also avoid rice paper Towel box mask stored. advice? Still appreciate it. think choose act fairly ok mask handling (could used Military ABC training) Florida Man now. educated individual. intentionally going murder Floridians. loose family due Trumps Cum dumpster (Desantis). justice. one idiots weird got downvoted lmao true, even among experts expected florida bigger problem months ago. mean they're woods anything taken way longer expected big deal think article OP tired link.  don’t know see need govt deposit accounts. 

You’re destroying retail banking industry you’ve decided they’re predatory. allow USPS provide banking services reasonable understandable cost structure. fee equivalent multiple first class letter postage per transaction, fees, limited services.

Sone things fix competition instead legislation. Subheading: 
 
#The state continue reopen.

Of course. Sweden started higher baseline mobility, would indicate NPI fatigue impactful there. compare mobility data various countries here: plan, shut first time? worked yes mean that's keeping typical status quo. 

The South isnt exactly known economic prosperity healthcare outcomes. makes sense--except sometimes younger people live older people. at-risk people--both wife mom highly-at-risk creates real problem two teenagers house. somewhat edge case though might ""tough titties"" best can. 


Still infuriates see many people can't burden slap fucking paper mask around people. Japan death toll 940 people, total. One huge reason reckon they...wear...masks...in public places. confirms mask protect idiots, time absence says stupid ignorant, both. Florida, particularly Miami doomed this? see almost everyone wearing mask gone grocery shopping popping store, cases steep rise. What’s next 2 months look like? taken anyone longer 2 weeks symptoms show up? Yeah, would 2020 happen! Yeah, thing case since beginning closing carry-out booze allowed. People people do.

And shaming New Yorkers work, lol. make difficult enough they'll give up. What's worse do? free market people infuriatingly wrong always. Page found. Somebody linked Gelman's judgement statistics; paper least Lmao ofc got downvoted this.  It’s like scene Chernobyl try convince people dive reactor 200 rubles. Sure helps. certainly theory possible get work larger regions well, everyone said regions works team. Fair enough, lol. like MMA knowledge/breakdowns - I'll give much least. side note, one funniest youtube comments ever saw one JRE appearances, ""I think I've heard everything he's going say life already."" Yes agree said. wasn’t even locked first. 7 Bay Area counties acted first, everyone else followed suit later including governor. makes sad used think somewhat favorably leadership abilities shit proves he’s head doesn’t know make right call. He’s coward. afraid today new Alabama, Arizona Texas numbers going be. There's debate Rapture happen relation end times. mentioned tribulations, actually stated happen them.

That change fact guy's PoS though. went lockdown. early predictions nothing. FDH website, wonder Rebekeh Jones's dashboard even higher? Bad faith comments like worth responding to. Transmission likely inside others prolonged periods time, like restaurants, churches, house parties. It’s shared air. Boycott China Forloop, assume purely due covid unlogical scientific.

You realize brutal lockdowns mental health alarming cases overdoses drug related problems self harm suicides. live, hospitals lock heavily burdened overdoses 

There also likely backlog individuals refused care couldnt get care various ailments lock down.

Domestic violence alcohol issues incredibly high. realize drinking bottle whiskey thousands times risky walking around without mask

The majority population need hospital treatment covid either.

The excess death occcured poorly managed care homes refused care, due government bureaucratic reasons nothing full hospital's.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Honestly live San Diego one wearing mask. huge parties everywhere people don’t care... it’s upsetting. Someone spit wearing mask hiking trail. People trash.. It’s clear another lockdown won’t fly. reason continue reopen things know options point. hundreds thousands dead crashed economy hundreds thousands dead semi functioning economy. picking lesser two evils. 

People need know government care. vulnerable means limit social contact, need it. 

This terrible varying consequences people different financial occupational situations horrible reality point. 

The United States government state’s government fully aware accepting fact poor, sick, vulnerable Americans decimated. 

People need wake need protect leaders CARE. even right mask... kids either getting dishing First world problems resident Albuquerque, even surprised. - according this, 366,193 tests Arizona 40,924 positive tests. better source data? Yes, technically that. Although argued even grocery delivery area less safe could put higher risk. person delivering groceries around riskier situations.

I also don’t think would good mental health move new area time would literally isolate completely even able meet people make new acquaintances friends. wish kind overarching guidelines everyone following instead every state different things certain parts country restrictive parts less restrictive. whole thing sucks everyone. Wtf guy. expectations unreal. want study showing longterm impacts CoVid young asymptomatic cases virus emerged late Nov/Dec?

Choose one DeSantis needs get real level people Florida seriousness situation. People can’t live life like there’s pandemic, masks use needs normalized time needs limit indoor gatherings. feeling people's exposure think even reading headlines reading hearing Facebook posts claiming MSM saying. “Well well well, isn’t consequences actions!” Funny prices keep going up. know facts difficult comprehend head cow’s ass ...texas...isnt...southern..?...map? Ive always lived texas called south whole life. else u consider it? D= confused You’ll waiting study several years. us prefer cautious many factors unknown. know months ago “medical grade” masks thought keep germs too. May share kind dreams had, would like know possible. Thank you. using respirator go shopping since March. 0 fucks given. feeling safety see people wearing masks chin nose perched top masks priceless. Funding.  It’s Trump record funding relative anyone else re-election campaign. probably situation face value Oh boy, can't wait jogging outdoor exercise get ruined caste people private gyms personal trainers. zero years medical school zero years study epidemiology, somehow knew this.

Oh yeah, read Connie Willis' Doomsday Book. Unfortunately sounds like we've good far long people can't even wear masks protect other. difficult, people whatever crazy reason. Evil guy: haha! Look! good man! Haha! opinions must make us equal! Rau rau rau.... 

:/ supposed picture taking seriously, see Oklahoma. least people picture somewhat social distancing. took picture public place today vs year ago, two pictures would show social activity. movie theaters open, quite literally business usual maybe 5% masks. Maybe. ...and none among world's billionaires  Cave Creek; knowing mayor Ernie Bunch (not personally) - suspect really wants right thing tell everyone mask up. think he's afraid business owners result. economy town 100% centered around out-of-towners coming shopping dining out. businesses already took huge hit cancelling bike-week rodeo-days. election coming competitor trump-style conservative, I'm guessing he's going anything. may surprise though.

The locals generally good folks, I'm seeing pretty good mask discipline grocery stores. restaurants pricey nicknack shops run town; much cater wannabe-wild-west attitude. read article. stand former statement. take ton leadership classes expecting subordinates mind readers really advised, except world ""plausible deniability"" Florida fucked. months months told would next Italy nothing happened. numbers stayed low live went on. it’s really happening people dismiss another false alarm. say mask use increasing weeks pass, it’s nowhere near needs be. I’d say average usage 40-50% best. affluent (educated) areas probably like 60-65% usage. Unfortunately large elder population mask usage among incredibly low tend follow trump rhetoric. exponential growth assumption month shit gets real. happened Chile?  fucking disgusting new jersey government failed Fair enough, certainly wrong. I'm UK originally honestly seems care less people alive seems true current US government. Wow. fuck? Happy living PA/DE required wear mask. crushing pandemic here. tests need go brain anymore. styles need go inch so. quality podcasts entirely dependant guests gets. 
 
The podcast recently Bill Burr great due almost entirely Burr great guest incredible comedian (it also Burr repeatedly dunking Rogan dumbass views virus). less bankruptcies recession good economy adding national debt pay private companies. surprisingly good (to me) far hospitalizations deaths state. may viewpoint comes from. self-quarantining since March keep eye numbers listen friends work hospitals--and shockingly (IMO) good here...so far.  Brevard County, retiree destination, hardly hospitalizations months 16 deaths 600,000 people.  
That could well change weeks ahead. Won’t obvious side effects? ACE2 receptor cells used normal function. Won’t angiotensin, supposed bind receptor instead bind sponge cause problems things like blood pressure regulation? said everyone joined BML protests.  waiting Newsom? longer wait, people die. That's going nightmare. family comes one week vacation. get exposed first day spread next 5 days trip. Day 5 start showing symptoms supposed quarantine 2 weeks. think they'll move plane tickets rent hotel room additional two weeks? think they'll go airport plane like normal? Damn! It’s spreading uncontrollably seems. LOCKDOWN 2.0 incoming. Re-reading really struck since surpassed PA. PA started first part reopening June 5 (in SE PA anyway). Yet Texas open long now? You’d think they’d lean... also going up? lol? Really risk takeout workers passing other, there's pretty low risk customer catching employee. still means though shut one worker gets it. ohio stores went made people wear mask one coming police buy 6 3 masks 30 cents dumb ass people crying meh freedoom 10 mins tell police said would lock putting people danger left bought mask fuck talking shut fuck up. don’t understand comment shut fuck photo 20-something, otherwise healthy Chicago woman‘s lungs removed transplant scared hell me. couple friends previously werent afraid assumed everyone would get waking reality.

This 2020...

Narratives dont matter..

Just truth...

There more:

Evil: 'hey look poor guy, good! Hahaha...' Enthusiasts like concur. Desantis Miracle! You’re idiot. you’re willing risk life, that’s fine. absolutely right expose family members society members. Go keep precious economy going risking life life loved ones. Keep mind economy recover eventually won’t get relatives lives back. 

You used pawn recover economy, brainwashed think economy important life. sacrifice government willing make you’re fine that. willing risk life others make money. Survival lf fittest, quite literally. Mayor Nomask gets Nomask disease. Story 11. still among highest overall cases deaths per 100k people country. That's say states wont surpass them, currently tons states didnt suffer much MA. \[Please learn natural selection\]( ) think New York's worst percent jump went 0 cases 1. Also maybe, maybe, small cold island middle nowhere may, may, help. Everyone wants hate landlords.

I expenses too, carry risk providing safe housing families fair price parties agreed on.

I refuse situation I’m providing free housing. yeah shocking... well look USA handling.. lets use National disgrace... 120k dead, probably 200k end year... great work Despite spikes, death rate consistently fallen since April. think agree great news! ashamed admit makes optimistic. holy shit dude, need get ass office job something bit. Dafuq jobs absolutely balls-to-the-wall ridiculous for? L.A.'s testing like crazy. may true surge too, unlike TX, AZ, FL, big chunk new cases increased testing. joke. He's glad someone figured away around order modify it. Oh my, saying cause got means proof. might essential worker know are. guess got covid even wearing masks taking sht load safety precautions. Covid get eyes even. That's easily spreads. 

And even reduced percentages masks, still spread. virus expert calculated number deaths caused covid protests. guess what, deaths per day cause protests deaths black people cops whole year. basically killing black people could possible ever save. killing races top that.

And hate VR toys. join fun there. proposition 

Me whole ""pro-Tegnell"" gang upvote every single shitpost regarding Sweden. case turn Sweden actually chose right approach, (something know couple years) - willingly infect COVID 19. game? think that's actually tends happen naturally. mutates time passed quite sightly. mutations matter.

But make less lethal. strains likely survive ones kill people quickly. time, could become less intense.

That could years though app important good old person telephone calls.

the APIs even thing. 

&amp;#x200B;

they CAPABLE tracking location (using GPS/Location Services).

all tell within X feet someone infected. Yes. read somewhere AC units (specifically window AC units) facilitate viral transmission (I think noted case study Wuhan early on). involved infected person sitting table AC unit people two tables beside table infected person sitting front AC contracted virus. idea fan AC blew droplets tables close by. wear one! Avoid Miami like...well, like plague! hope Trump gets Corona Virus. Would epic moment 2020 special type stupid think COVID-19 ""not real"" Great idea. someone point scientific studies show masks helpful slowing spread COVID-19? Thanks. would lead believe true? also drools himself. amazing often subreddit shits actually trying find information situation rather rely headline stating ""almost capacity"" actually means something.

Maybe issue elective surgeries large number beds, next step would stop those? Maybe that's important understand leading bottleneck? considering public transportation mode transportation 90% people big city, case emergency, would suggested do?

I never suggested done anything differently. mentioned subway precisely mode transportation probably spreads innately staff/resources, given time, hospitals population.

Bigger cities hospital staff resources proportion population? I'm shocked. Next tell police, shops, restaurants too. 3,600 Texas yesterday.
We going shitter together. company open pandemic. know many people said ""fuck shit"" took leaves things got bad? work it, realize absolutely terrifying see customers coming respiratory distress heart failure right front eyes realize OMFG...this happen someone love. 

Once step foot back workplace, option kind financial assistance see completely fucked shit trapped middle now. afraid hug kids come home bc MIS-C, afraid kiss hug spouse give kill them, afraid visit elderly relatives make sick die.

Everyone thinks open high rates infection masks necessary everyone luxury privilege staying home front row seat seeing horrible virus is. can't seem find got 3,207 new cases. research COVID people MRSA considered immunocompromised? really explanation point. figures om ""most people wearing masks""? social distancing saw plenty news reports protestors without masks. goes NBAs plans resuming season Disney Hell, barely consider Texas US State. 

It's like conservative social experiment gone awry. COVID-19 death risk people &lt;65 years old period fatalities epidemic equivalent death risk driving 13 101 miles per day 11 countries 6 states, higher (equivalent death risk driving 143-668 miles per day) 6 states UK. People &lt;65 years old without underlying predisposing conditions accounted 0.7-2.6% COVID-19 deaths (data available France, Italy, Netherlands, Sweden, Georgia, New York City). 

CONCLUSIONS: People &lt;65 years old small risks COVID-19 death even pandemic epicenters deaths people &lt;65 years without underlying predisposing conditions remarkably uncommon. Strategies focusing specifically protecting high-risk elderly individuals considered managing pandemic.

End nonsense lock instead landlord stop able pay mortgage house, lose profits (which could mean lose income) get house foreclosed on?

My laws retired ability rent two houses own. tenents stop paying literally lose income too.

Tough world. rate, Florida nearly 100,000 new cases within month. Sounds like pretty sensitive someone pointing there's problem there. Doctors cause virus mean. first handed people job early experience helped prolonging life said patient. add AZ data wonderful post...

* Please join us /r/CoronavirusAZ Arizona specific info updated daily. LIBERATE WALT DISNEY WORLD!!!  dying out. Elaine Chao, head transportation made decision. Irony knows bounds. Two beers work day 8:38 morning. WFH. lol, joking, right? There's chance they're going reconsider. Enough people decided longer care many people they're going kill, want fun. Totally nailed it. Florida citizens, bite bullet, close non life sustaining businesses 2 months. end like NY, PA cases hitting record lows every days instead gaining. troll people really outstandingly bad understanding world like this? Trump Hannity last night talking open schools ASAP.

We're F U C K E D. need wear masks street

Yes, absolutely should, least city lots people walking around. mention one like NYC already hit damn hard high likelihood walking around near infected people. 

A suburban neighborhood might pass one person every 5 minutes easily walk around them? Sure whatever - super low risk. dense urban setting requires mask.

And agreed, people acting like over. *a lot* are. Way many. interesting. hope continue research it. could give people clearer idea risks covid.  outside, virus can't get we're chance infection way lower (19x) inside. 

The problem likely amplified by: restaurants, restrooms much more. 

Just outside dangerous. even wear mask, socially distance. assume problem people giving shit, beach alone dangerous spot, neither park. Keep distance fine.   makes efforts useless

Not entirely, mean I'm going catch COVID-19 staying home. hospitals ICUs handling this? newspapers it, I've never able figure get numbers - they're often slightly different dashboard (this big difference). walk without mask. great, can. old scarf, t-shirt, bedsheet, etc? cut one square use rubber bands make mask (see CDC website). Heck, even use coffee filter string. Unless healthcare setting COVID-19 positive people, opinion. Legit. reopening NY phased proceeds metrics met infections, contact tracing, hospitalizations. It’s free like Florida. I’m damn tired doomers think trying return even semblance normal life means we’re going die. \*freedumb feel. matter bad President person think is. dont wish death upon anyone.  time, get it. hope bad enough finally realizes serious problem that's surprise done start almost none would happening economy complete clusterfuck. point government clearly decided cash get voted longer even attempt pretend care pandemic. internet. There’s many avenues actually buy online, put mailbox days later without interact anyone. found days ago it’s game changer.

An added bonus it’s often cheaper online vs store wonder %age cases needing hospital treatment now? mean, I'm saying difficult many, ""months hell total isolation"" pretty dramatic take it. People still saw folks grocery store. Passed street. internet exists. Video games exist. Phones exist. prison isolation cells. Lol fuck that. Come arrest bro. mean even outside yard 3 months lol get caught regularly. Certain colors conversation it. 

Since virus politicized though, seems counterproductive ban talk it, are. 

The best root virus hit communities see public health political attack hardest allow chance better future.  see. Yes would nice see.


My point posting point quarantine flatten curve Florida regardless reasoning seeing record breaking amounts Covid FL phase 1 reopening May 4th, lot stuff partially opened area basically full reopening. makes sense spike begun month afterwards. Hahaha it’s global health pandemic.... movement Half population lives one city.  know that's from, genius measure ""improvement"" baseline? i.e. show situation previous week? He's got senile. vote November legal resident count elderly Florida. That's brilliant. Totally gonna try make stick. 3207 new cases reported today, highest ever total one day Florida - good.  pretty much everyone. correct, simply put way renters landlords Reddit. kind full picture thinking usually embraced folks either 1) unusually open minded, 2) overwhelming minority landlords. know there's ""no politics"" allowed sub..

But point going start pointing finger blaming side that's clearly perpetrating anti-science stance that's going get lots people killed? 

I get politics makes tricky, pretty fucking clear politics dictating virus people.. science. muh freedom? Meanwhile coddle try bring common sense (which always fails) killing people. there's that. Amen! wife shy year now, we're actually getting fuck end next month. virus outbreak, planning leave November/December year, wife working due self-imposed quarantine, there's literally nothing keeping us here. 

It's blanket statement say ""I'm surrounded assholes!"" assholes everywhere, AZ assholes actually get possibly infected ignorant bullheaded. 

And even virus......we ready leave people fucking stupid. icing cake, goddamn health family's health stake. getting downvoted people likely consider ""pro-science"". posted scientific research, goes herd narrative can't that! problem moving people critical conditions easy.  i'd like know paid much.

also whether donate countries need keep hawking panacea once-in-a-lifetime collective breath entire world took beautiful thing. know live, nature prosperous spring ever seen. data point, I'm HB masks become unusual neighborhood *remember* occasions see another person wearing one. Even businesses ""require"" requiring them. PMs 6ft apart wearing masks view them. look mortality figures at: Note scary Swedish excess mortality among children. sad say this, they've failed miserably. 

Where see excess mortality among Swedish children?

You second person seen past days tried underscore number young Covid casualties Sweden.

According data number Swedish deaths 60yrs old per åldersgrupp"" lower right ""deaths age group"" anyone following along) enforcement mechanism business - don’t wear one H-E-B, county city whoever fine H‑E‑B. Abbott’s bullshit can’t require individuals wear masks, it’s totally okay require businesses require individuals wear masks. Biggest eye rolls. matter percentage is? Clearly, hospital nearly capacity issue. Trying dig find percentage COVID paints picture someone trying paint non-issue. hospital concerned capacity, fucking problem due COVID. That's enough. need get talking deciphering percentages, jfc. treatment used now, deemed effective enough move forward actually studied clinical trial. LIBERATE WALT DISNEY WORLD! 5% lethal virus. scary That’s 1 every 8. Damn. late Oh yeah, totally. feel able mandate things, less stupid people going unaccountable. normal life back soon. will... raining week now, today sun shining feel safe enough first time take walk (I've cautious). getting one room apartment seeing fresh air knowing hope coming made feel really good. Someday we'll look back this, shake heads never think again. Maybe today, maybe tomorrow, someday rest lives. likely answer. Heck-of-a-job donnie Someone downvoted comment, unreal. DJT rally could fix I'm sure.... one biggest foreign policy disasters US history agree you. making vaccines 200 years. compare medical technology today time. years trial error behind us perfect method. 
""But we've never coronavirus vaccine"" yes, many people would go get vaccinated something might lower chances getting cold 20%??? Assuming 100% effective, 20% colds caused coronaviruses, still stuck forms. people really going pay get pricked that?? pointless vaccine SARS MERS made progress towards vaccine jumpstarted current development. 

On hand I'll play devil's advocate bring useless antibody testing imperfect diagnostic testing right now, combined insane sheer pressure race first bring market (that pressure greater manufacturing already underway). see much data manipulation simple studies like hydroxychloroquine every day study completely contradicting one day before, I'm going hope there's evil CEO sitting somewhere manipulating numbers paperwork. not. NFL year. Put bank. can't, government decided population disposable long economy gets feed. Sorry. little higher that, count people eventually died sick time study. Netherlands' death toll started declining pretty seriously around mid-May, far off. Maybe 0.7%. lw&lt;#op@vvYuU""TGLAmj~j+3o_&amp;v_z7ov^svS`yU[oreJ#*{Ze%|*vkfXM&lt;O[Ggo According article, Target's big change allowing returns, big deal. sounds like they're keeping social distancing policies now. california headed too. Sweden disagrees you.  They'll done wearing mandatory masks years years... call Redneck Riviera nothin'. 
The residential side bad, though. keep forever, forget remain frightened. virus new know that. There’s long term peer reviewed studies back claim. Legitimate rhetorical question. yes, upon prior research straight answer. 

Of course number higher what’s reported anywhere world. could truly give accurate number dead infected reality Covid-19 gag order.

Aren’t defensive one plague censored filled world. That's places mandated masks also mandate social distancing Ok, change fact metric misleading? make OK us mock people rightfully point misleading? cannot believe actually upvoted suggesting sheltering place year. website rocker. ""Masks work"" *kinda* true contexts. Surgical masks prevent infection, want people think masks solve problem. People look easy answers easy answer.

As usual, nuance lot people struggle with. Even masks merely reduce transmission virus 50%, that's *huge* win country comes mitigating pandemic. that's early recommendations fell flat: properly explaining masks *help* quite bit solution. need take multiple mitigating actions: 6ft social distancing plus mask, combined minimizing sort non-essential contact people outside home, need practice really make work.

But no, many Americans lazy, sorta dumb, impatient explained. personally paranoid long time want order Amazon due whole counterfeit problem their. Whenever something gets massive demand fake product shows Amazon. I've multiple items knockoffs. want take chance something important. Locally choice. something stock that's there. never saw large option mask, scraping left behind.

Also people know know. really simple time. hear protesters took statue, though. certain side America threatening kill March / April.

Deplorable. Authority bias also huge problem. That’s caused mask fiasco. much bad science there...

Authority bias: tendency attribute greater accuracy opinion authority figure (unrelated content) influenced opinion. report back let us know see non compliance? really depends purpose training. lactate threshold training, example, advice would completely wrong. \- Masks help keep people around getting sick

\- there's asymptomatic spread, even know sick

\-if wear mask, hurting vulnerable around you. here's make mask sock.

\- healthcare workers exposed ones need high quality masks. any, please donate yours. Ask every celebrity earth advocate help cause

\-home depot, amazon, ebay, every paint store (january, feb) we'll buy n95s. They're needed healthcare workers please stop sale homeowners

You can't undo lie expect good percentage country believe (or again). Holy fuck, dude. PPE boat person active r/atheism negligible damage first time caught extremely mild case

Except asymptomatic cases still develop ground glass opacities lungs, indicative lung damage. Jury still extent damage permanent.  know, allready, tell us. bet Brazil President also one point, remember video coughing cabinet meeting going around internet months ago? “On July 17” 

The grammar article got sick Occam's Razor best. Smug redditors volunteer doubt, like meatpacking plants COVID-19 worse ever still killing people color police Hahah. fuck. make sense? even open physical classrooms we're going hybridized anyway? got word morning that, course, budget cut. might think virus - nah, happens every year. they're us eliminate many ""paper products"" (diagrams, pictures, worksheets, reading materials, tests, etc...) possible favor online digital resources. I'm - I've pretty tech centered classroom entire career. However, case schools, accomplishing goals home would school? meaning immunity last months, like coronaviruses No, he's quadragenarian noodle. Thank you
Ugh amount people without them.

And wear nose :O Brazillian Culture + Worst Manegment President World. Actually biggest representative figure country basically saying whatever want. come back NYC like before? Since NZ seems problem control much zero cases. NYC reach level no? Yeah, ask Brazil safe thiing. one Nope

...if players ones getting sick. Who's gonna play games? must disheartening sad see country spent entire life serving spit face. feel bad medical experts want help us, return they're straight turned villains. mask nose thing irritates end. great example toxicity reddit -the echo chamber mentality, bullying used manufacture consent. Hope guys catch anything. And? name city. doctors New York flew to, say, Iran save 79-year old woman's life, headline would highlight details story geographical gap doctors traveled save life patient. mad Chinese city. you, numbnuts. continue cement place ""flyover country"". Ah yes, us mask wearing idiots, wearing PPE keep others safe healthy. moronic us follow facts understanding very, minor inconvenience personal life greater good.

It's political thing either, fricken science facts.

I hope grandparents stay safe healthy. n95 (or kn95) nothing know fit correctly. understand takes 2 people properly and, touch it, needs refit. half full face elastomeric respirator much easier seal easy test seal. full face version, looking completely stupid, virtually adjustability comfortable; on.

Honestly, what's point? 100 cases isnt game changer. original post made seem like California problem, true Los Angeles does. rest state fine. dont think disagree me, like argue, people like make want stop wearing damn mask, problems small. goal? Click blue txt post replied to. Read manifesto inbox, agreeing you, saying wow look guy inbox proving point. Also downvotes you. http://imgur.com/a/YsqKlXw receipt. 0 points downvotes me. Colombian* lockdowns keeping earning living. fact, cases lockdowns reason people kept jobs. economy fully reopen, everyone feel safe would still stay home employer would promptly lay enough business keep payroll. want rush full realization current economic realities along extent, guest. fears based science. think helpful 3M seems ""hat""-like head covering shield attached to? keep reading best shield covers entire front face, maybe even better covers top head too? (I'm little worried looking silly front coworkers haha, I'll suck means less disease transmission.) remember pretty much everyone saying that. Hell, think Newsom said it. look CA now.  know people who've tested positive protests, despite taking precautions like always wearing mask trying keep away densest crowds.

People need stop declaring victory prematurely. Remember everyone press jerking good job Gavin Newsom Cali? Right. support mass gatherings. never said did. support mass gatherings black lives matter, anti-lockdown. perfectly demonstrating bias used say want. Well done. I’m losing track city and/or state breaking records day day Californian approve (and happy dance around room). Another East Bay resident, attest this. Sounds like case southern Ca, would explain cases there. nothing Trump. may hyped AIFA Scientific Technical Commission Italian Medicines ones originally claimed use. Reddit far butt Trump said great want fail. right here... fucking insane. Stopped QuikTrip yesterday, roughly 20 people store, I'm one wearing mask. Karen standing behind nerve huff step closer guy front line. MARKERS FLOOR idiots can't figure social distancing own. Abbott also said schools re-opening can't force kids wear mask tested covid. like....wtf wrong you? !RemindMe one week

It's gonna heartbreaking. walkways touched many people.

Has even single *shred* evidence there's meaningful amount viral spread via fomites SARS2? true. It’s feasible everyone, I’m empathetic truly cannot make work financially.

But lot families “choose” lifestyles require two incomes. family forgoes expensive vacations, new cars, latest gadgets, eating out, cable TV, etc make single income work. It’s struggle, one wife think worth it. could never efficient vaccine. NYC peaked around 780 deaths/day. factor 30 daily deaths still have, that's 750 deaths day ""add"" back count.

That'd put daily deaths 1437/day, still better mid April. crazy absolutely heartless normal people be. work retail Ohio. Back first opened last month 50/50 split mask wearers non. Today I've seen probably 20 people far maybe four people mask on. ""an ounce prevention worth pound cure"" Obviously everyday wear ÅwËšŪm! Tell objective opinions fabric style lmao Meaning immune population may much bigger seropositive population, infected population would much bigger seropositive population too. Basically, sero-surveys tell much. think games still go count continue rise.
You see, country, matter people getting sick many hospitalized. becoming ""normal""  fellow Houstonian gives hope. Whenever go shopping wearing masks costco that's good. thing makes think definitely hasn’t he’s unhealthy heap fat shit would noticeable absence. Boris ended ICU he’s least 10% healthier him. &lt;shakes think going protect absurd

you poor misguided fool contact tracing data shows even anyone wearing masks chances catching infected person flight virtually nil. That's awesome caring yourself, fiance, and, indirectly, others come contact with. try careful are. 


Do reuse N95 masks? 3m cool flow ventilated models bought last year. reports say virus lives surfaces days longest, rotate two (out ~6 left). leave house maybe every days works out.

The day car shop (outdoors, 110F) sweat bucket. I'm guessing N95s take kindly moisture one thrown out.


Keep care. Sometimes feel like people becoming complacent desensitized whole situation. happened people's biggest fear infect others?

Another thing maybe prepare mentally physically meant happen, could happen feel bad weak anything negative.  states average test scores STEM compared neighbors really begs differ. think like idea potentially responsible killing granny Yes. country cannot survive shelter place one year. Economics much complicated whether consumers pay bills, can’t shut bulk economy year without bulk economy ceasing exist.

You simply uninformed think could shelter place year without massive non-compliance civil unrest. Oh still getting funding, public health measures restricting daily lives  like local university saying plan forcing students wear shoes shirts.

Sorta, main difference see maybe couple students total would try go without shirts shoes, like 20% would get mad mask requirement, getting violently angry filing lawsuits it. magnitude blowback much higher would far disruptive.

Not saying disagree you, get reluctant make hard requirement. People getting physically assaulted this. Either way, form danger. Something frustrating recently assumption ""Scientist man changed stance, must lying before."" 

That science works. give best recommendation based evidence hand, new evidence comes light, update recommendations. Here’s upvote completely right! Fantastic positive news! Good take step long. time everyone get back work, government tit. Holiday grinding halt. Anti-intellectualism, science, you, integral part American culture ages. Obviously good thing it’s feature point. need improve educational standards country. getting downvoted childish views. first wanted write ""What actual fuck?!?!?!?!"", occurred places implement required masks need much money much issue.

Perhaps saving money places worse off? Florida Man manages outdo Texas, Nevada, Arizona, Oklahoma, Alabama... pretty ironic post top subreddit downvotes hell anything, matter source, that's contrary lockdowns masks upvoting hell pseudoscience bullshit comes CNN.  LA interesting place... They’ve saying since March 5000 deaths vs 500 

What endgame You’re one. It’s sad. Redditors always knew Florida Man's prowess tenacity stupidity general last years? likely young ""Bubbas"" protesting common sense need wear masks weeks ago.

Stupid stupid does. Dendrochronology fucks hard though: biggest potential tragedy see coming Trump presidency, bible beaters get Trump discover reveal location tree, go vandalize Jesus) everyone else wanting real time data things still ongoing. fucking god, ever done scientific studies? Jesus fuck Holy shit. That’s awful. :( damn u triggered No. ppl arent living alone. That's exactly feel. country stupid. countries virus control started wearing masks since day 1. 5 months pandemic still talking wear wear mask. Fuck country. No, south hot stupid. \#FauciLies Imagine cunt say newborn tragically died *two weeks old* quite long life. Get back box, absolute fucking melon. It’s funny conveniently forget Youtubers make money every view, don’t agenda post ridiculous eye-catching material get watch...they genuinely “educating” public miserable treating people like dirt every New Yorker's God-given right. flight attendants, pilots, airport workers? quarantined forever, go home families?

A contagious respiratory disease cannot eradicated. Lol. broke words wrong. close. Try think reasonable temporarily close business bunch employees infected COVID? Maybe seem 20s probably live alone hang people 20s. spreading it, would think it’s likely work. That's true, really feasible everyone gets tested every time get runny nose day two. would ideal, yes, going cost someone $1200 bucks test going impossible. Depending person is, situation, going determine reasonable tested.

&amp;#x200B;

Don't get wrong, testing key, I'm arguing that. People shout ""sovereign citizen freedoms"" outside Costco idiots. private businesses, government buildings, right deny entry anyone reason gender identity, race, sexuality. shot looking like criminal - care told politely I’d rather ride back seat got back without waiting reply Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* changed system collecting reporting data there's mess switch different regions correcting previous data, decided freeze series avoid weird jumps keep correcting numbers taking way long, might ready later week knows. 

They still report daily weekly new death numbers, like today reported 52 deaths last 7 days, updating historic series.  Historical mask recommendations clear cut looking back past flu guidance. example, recommendations 2009 flu recommend widespread use masks public, *did* recommend use family members.

""Avoid caregiver. unavoidable, use facemask respirator 4 5""

See: Interim Recommendations Facemask Respirator Use Reduce 2009 Influenza (H1N1) Virus Transmission

Edit: fucked pasting table, corrected it. Except people China know. Stop believing bullshit fed daily China. news worst world I'm sure know that, still choose believe tell China. FUCKING NORTH KOREA. said experts said mass gatherings good. seems lie. . . . dick stuck ring. now. statements originally made. There's really excuse many churches successfully gone online suspended services. even money, parents' church still collecting tithing like normal everyone's well. I'm trying judge, I'm Ohio situation last week found way resolve without ride shotgun anyone. there's there's way... Yep, transplant. found assholes like watch suffering think funny. F all! Maybe. Countries might sacrifice sovereignty. Yeah, might fast already. I’m thinking “Here’s data here’s you’re going do”. They’ve politicized masks good lord I’m gonna die politicians make statement 😡 remember vaccine testing &amp; approval small part overall effort. Production DISTRIBUTION going require massive effort scale US seen since WW2. far federal government shown inclination getting involved logistics distribution anything related pandemic. imagine told states figure themselves? wheeeeeeeeeeeeeee pretending exist thus causing suffering funnnnn! I'm hoping next weeks even dilholes accept quit little bitches it.  don’t want point fingers country earlier stage development. idea would President India since no-win situation. need militant nudist group start getting arrested trying go stores naked, screaming rights, wake people stupid they’re masks. .. ""eating meat"" prove?

that delicious  populace knowingly keeps voting politicians blatantly want kill them, say? Yea bit. It’s spike wouldn’t freak it. numbers I’ve seen: 1.5% increase positive 2% 3.5%. Death toll 50 people, 47 new cases bring total 2,071 4 person increase patients hospitalized 23 27. Yes it’s spike think it’s manageable. condescending poor way convince people. Florida new hotspot ... It’s better people think it’s real. Otherwise toilet paper disappears 5.4% positive national level. results based around 7000 people distributed Netherlands. city ! ever locate 21 million missing cellphone users 800,000 landlines lost 3 months, earlier year? like thinking know car crash like since never one deciding crash car purpose find out... people get info media politicians. seen either praise mass gatherings recently? Apparently forcing people wear masks equates depriving taxpayers services. words mine. 
Likely explanation bunch vocal folks objected based perception refusing aligns president. probably claimed discrimination blah blah blah. 
Also, saying things likely aligns trump believe gearing senate run term limited ala Rick Scott. 'Zonies still coming SD summer social distancing wearing masks either. Fuck Texas State University opens in-person summer courses July. ""We reopen safely! wear masks social distance! need open, responsibly!""

 -*People lying* Safe everyone donor False, first time Flordia reaches 3200 cases. said time... excuse Americans act like it’s Hamburger Hill. sacrifice! studies showing quickly individual becomes contagious, assuming happens instantly? I'm looking mostly Arizona LA. Arizona cases quadrupled temperature rising last weeks.   Lol evacuation orders mandated people sent around country. Give plasma post COVID risk getting second infection. may first case contagious narcissism, thousands around country buy president’s nonsense beliefs anything bad happens watch conspiracy multitude actors jealous awesome is. DAMN fucking queen! 

Same here, I'll tell what. dad spent six months hospital w/ sepsis spinal surgery, hand surgery, foot surgery, heart valve replaced. He's back full health two years later. Virus lives longer cooler temperatures people using AC less likely open windows bring fresh air. allow virus accumulate, increasing viral load, increasing risk infection. think observation SARS China infections spread “wealthy” hospital AC lower “poor” hospital open windows AC.  pretty common actually. 

One study former SARS patients found ~58% receiving steroids developed bone necrosis (osteonecrosis) 3 total, 58% cohort developed AVN 3 years observation. sole factor explaining AVN hip total dose corticosteroids Ok sorry New York welfare state lol hear terrible flu season happened year though?

Usually pneumonia deaths lumped together flu deaths. think part reason year’s “flu season” bad influx Covid-19 cases going undetected February March. Absolutely, I’m downplaying Covid! they’re wearing masks fighting lives isn’t hair cuts. best friend sitting banner desert oxygen struggling survive crap. 

Meanwhile, Ducey refuses mandate masks state level, he’s tossed responsibility cities (who holding masks-optional town halls discuss they’re going do). 

Gilbert town hall tomorrow. 60 people welcome inside, mask required, discuss whether mandate mask use. Already, mayors twitter feed full people shouting masks infringing freedom.

The town hall livecast online. It’s going insane. guess say effective immediately won’t ticket violations weekend Taiwan, Thailand, Vietnam? see countries like Singapore, Indonesia... won’t let consumerism FUCK hard scribe logos rotted body ? Fuck reddit Dang. fam split O. 
My mom, cautious one, staying home much possible O. pops, complete contrast, went beach first opened went casinos, happens A. can't believe wait 2022 able vote out. He's *three times*, need consider stricter term limits cos that's insane. california?  Grocery stores also air conditioned. kid, we'd go cool off! white collar work zone, though. seen single expert say mass gatherings good. That's lie anti-science people concocted rationalize ignorance. Sorry typo. Sweden disaster.

Lol, literally commenting thread talks fact absolutely not. 

I'm done losing time you. Damn shame got 20% paycut. still barely qualify anything even roommates. 300 bucks lower 5k per month property nothing. New landlord took building. Wants $300 month. pleasant words renew. Oh, cool, let know rents dropping ain't happening DC area. military state children hospitals florida right now. rare possibly kids home often adults. dont know much yet. transplant recipients ""high risk"" - they're immunosuppressants..

&amp;#x200B;

giving covid plasma antibodies makes hell lot sense. body going problems making them.. can't let body attack lungs getting meds.

&amp;#x200B;

first lung transplant.. antibody transplant.

makes perfect sense. understand difference official press propaganda? Xinhua news mouth piece government. criticize basically part government itself. see depressions also recessions. anything new, look 2008. serious yet. Also never Great Depression ever market close stock market gets frozen stop dipping, look March 2020. yet... offices receive zero attention media. places new outbreaks occurring, offices never ordered shut first place. ashes embers. Leftish here. Yes, testing factor. sure saying isn’t. However, fact we’re seeing larger reductions cases like European Asian developed nations generally concerning everyone regardless politics. news, water wet Put impeached President’s cheeseburgers, shouldn’t take long mean... includes Peru. Also Jersey! first state statewide mask requirement general public!

We also currently [lowest estimated transmission COVID-19 state! Damn I’m trying move Denton Sorry get drug resistant malaria **hydroxychloroquine** useless least lupus folks US good supply next century. Wait! Gamblers taking risks? ‘probably fine’... makes feel much better haha thanks response tho. Appreciate it! 

But yeah, definitely agreed. It’s unnecessary kind annoying point time span—one year WWI three months US? quick whole number basis estimation, mean COVID deaths occurred four times faster WWI. per capita rates different time scales puts even. 
Well stipulate mask worn seated takes eating account. stated right article.

""At places downtown Ferndale, including Danny's, customers wear mask seated, required entering walking around."" interest rates 6% again, people would likely paying exact amount per month they're paying today

Sure, drop mortgage balance 30%. much take care mosquitoes ? Basically leadership USA par Haitian government. spent nine days intensive care last month, considered recovered it’s two weeks since first symptoms. he’s still tied oxygen tank home. can’t walk drug store block away. chest feels tight, pulse rate, used 70 80 beats per minute, spikes 130 tries walk slowly across room.  
  can’t return work. can’t walk street,” said Hard, mental health therapist musician lives Fairmount. “If ask county state health departments, I’m recovered, talk doctor recovery could take months regain lung function.”   
   case illustrates powerful novel coronavirus be, long take people regain functions.  
  also illustrates word “recovered” doesn’t necessarily mean think means public officials announce say someone recovered Covid generally mean virus gone,” said Dr. Helen Jacoby, infectious disease specialist St. Joseph’s Health Hospital. “The vast majority people completely recover get back normal life, somebody seriously ill recovery period long.”  
  going like six months now?” Dr. Anthony Fauci, director National Institute Allergy Infectious Diseases, asked speech last week. “We don’t know that. There’s lot need learn.” Literally every article gives caveat it’s rare


Second sentence : “While syndrome rare, I'm mean.. people think desantis could tell handle anything? Hes 45s best bud. ignorant live First, thank taking time respond.

I really understand argument making, testing impact spread disease, thing testing raise ceiling number confirmed cases. States test would accurate picture many people sick, tests (or less tests) impact many people get sick state.

I think making argument back March NY testing, lot sick people going unconfirmed. ramped testing people started showing confirmed cases numbers peak got pretty high. think making case new hotspots better job testing massive number untested people disease materialize graphs coming days weeks. 

Please correct I'm incorrect argument making.

What argument (which could incorrect about) seem address growth changed one way testing. disease grows logistically, roughly modeled following formula

N(d+1) = N(d) \* (1 + E + R0)

Where 

N(d+1) number cases tomorrow

N(d) number cases today

E Average number people someone infected exposed day

R0 Base Reproduction Factor, probability exposure becomes infection.

The argument I'm making new hotspot states controlling E, continuing pursue aggressive reopening strategies, controlling R0, refuse enforce mask wearing policies.

So E R0 high, makes Reproduction Coefficient high, would predict day would see cases states number new cases would grow day day. look graphs states seeing, growth cases growth rate new cases.

\---

Now answer actual question testing rates

So used worldometer original comment, site nice graphs tables today yesterday, harder get historic data. 

Lucky us, Johns Hopkins Center Systems Science Engineering publishes detailed data here: see data says, exercise look Arizona, Florida, Texas three emerging hotspots. using May 16th June 16th samples since published data today yet. give us picture one month back.

On May 16th number tests state interested follows.

Arizona: 146,788 tested 2,016.67 / 100,000 people

Florida: 630,047 tested 2,933.49 / 100,000 people

Texas: 678,471 tested 2,339.89 / 100,000 people

On June 16th number tests state interested follows.

Arizona: 354,334 tested 4868.08 / 100,000 people

Florida: 1,460,309 tested 6,799.18 / 100,000 people

Texas: 1,348,442 tested 4,650.46 / 100,000 people

We get rough estimate current test per day period subtracting two dividing 30.

Arizona testing (354,334 - 146,788) / 30 = 6,918.2 per day

Florida testing (1,460,309 - 630,047) / 30 = 27,675.4 per day

Texas testing (1,348,442 - 678,471) / 30 = 22,332.4 per day

For comparisons sake look New York April 12th May 12th, sadly data set I'm using earlier test data

New York April 12th: 461,601 tested 2,737.68 / 100,000 people

New York May 12th: 1,225,113 tested 7,265.95 / 100,000 people

Per Day Estimate: (1,225,113 - 461,601) / 30 = 25,450.4

So outpacing Texas outpaced Florida. accurately summed American population. laugh now, let's see who's laughing 100 years. getting numbers? I'm seeing LA 7,500 Houston 3,500. don’t disagree. Pouring money alone won’t help. 

We need reform. entire approach education archaic ineffective anyway. Why? Everyone knew cases would go testing. Heat denatures it.

The hotter area faster denatures.

Sunlight much faster.  Yes, everything say true things complicated. Thailand reopened domestic tourism considering letting tourists countries eradicated virus. lockdown always quite ""weak"" industries continued normal, pretty much everything except tourism completely back normal. feels like much stable situation countries let spread wildly start, despite Thailand fully back normal. mean, honest, many Westerners going money go holidays Thailand travel anyway? Western tourism already large decline pre-covid, mostly replaced Chinese Russian tourists. They'll probably allow tourists China soon.

A strong/quick lockdown cooperative population gives country time think, options choose from, ways adapt economy changes. feel that's main advantage really. coronavirus mutates different virus altogether, probably yes. One tenants missed rent payment months ago. Since know backyard/basement bunch crap previous tenants needs get tossed planning pay someone deal with, prepared offer tenant free month two rent without needing repay anything she'd take care yard/basement cleanup. eventually able get unemployment paid owed end suggesting it, maybe idea could use - there's kind project property needs tenants could do. Shit, let's hope curve stays that. Fingers crossed TX! Sweden like 1500 day 10 million pop. We're going hit 1 million cases friday morning. We're coming USA!

But seriously, sad living right now. amount negationism towards virus country absurd. sorry neighbouring hermanos. Hope governments stays closed borders Brazil 2021. Eastern Oregon still relatively temperate weather patterns continue rock extremes. Also, people typically like move entire plane flight away families friends, hence migrations No, blaming public completely shitty. Like, think hospitals going local Walgreens get masks? Obviously not. even more, government could intervened procure PPE directly manufacturers.

I'm sure went way did, surgeon general others straight lied public degraded trust, well cause immense harm saying completely clear terms masks ineffective. one thing's sure, whatever reason, mask shortage STILL problem hospitals, nothing people hoarding. 

It everything hospitals ill-prepared, also early narrative trying downplay severity virus. Blaming public idiocy supply chain shameful I'm sure many people latched onto that. 20 days WDW opening. Wonder it’ll happen. seen virus people's lungs :( fucking serious. Jeeze anxiety killing me, I'm waiting catch even leave house. Yeah, states well -- federal government, would mandate 50 states CDC guidance. would help Americans feel safer going back participating economy society, would make epidemic look less awful you-know-who politically speaking, win-win. Okay two SLIGHTLY less 260. true, honestly it’s much contracting thing there’s ‘fix’ gets anxious. Especially read healthy 30 year old died bunch vents... 

Also 100+ viruses there, medicines cures available. example sure don’t care much it’s flu season, literally don’t even think it. There’s doctors spare.

You billion dollars spend doctors, working states money doesn’t matter.

And absolute stupidity reduced reimbursements primary care physicians resulted proliferation specialists cannot flex readily hospitalist roles combined tons midlevels working primary care absolutely cannot utilized hospitalist role.

So short doctors need begin with, there’s way get more. stupid chapter pandemic.

if lucky cases time school starts. everyone gets miserable. Yet again, GDP means little. USA struggles rank anywhere top 20 almost metric measure success.

Greatness country mean country lot money. means average citizen better citizens countries.

...and seriously pulled stat? mean organization president threatening leave completely want admit screwed entire country's pandemic response try save money make look good? Since allows ability express distance traveled without granularity doxx enough testing going on, rate positive tests important total number tests conducted. rate high states surging cases hospitalizations, Testing alone answer. social distancing, wearing masks etc, expanded testing tell virus control. Meanwhile, ICU beds filling fast. Germany: Merkel long despised role refugee crisis, extraordinary handling pandemic got safe reelection popularity - declined tough. It’s simply amazing think point instead hearing wearing masks, social distancing. Florida opening things up. ways it’s mind boggling wearing mask 20 minutes store drawing line. could much people listened. aren’t asking put bicycle yourself. top Disney World yet even open yet. It’s soon time consider moving things elsewhere. NBA, WWE, sports look Florida place be. Well least states requiring masks. called National Guard assist contract tracing finally admits health problem AZ. also finally get rapid result testing implemented. ridiculous wearing masks. extreme, opposite end spectrum. Good them, many countries done little killed many  $2k 680 ayyy You’re probably fine. I’ve read, length exposure amount exposure important factors, seem pretty low case. yeah, taking mask say thank nice, old formalities good thing could get sick. Finally. Please never forget long took happen. allowed getting negative press pressure local officials healthcare workers. less week ago refused admit even problem here. Quick stockpile Dexamethasone Vitamin D. feeling fleet refrigerated trucks driving south Northeast. truck drivers don’t know destination yet. know people downvoting. Target far worst place I've ever worked for.. even considering job got severely injured became homeless it. Something I’ve noticed others much people care proportionate far away location event is. something happened, let’s say, Boston, would scared. it’s California even Chicago, don’t care much. 

Might also selection bias, you’re interested things happening closer far away.

I understand wanting go back normal. imagine there’s coronavirus outbreak near them, they’re going treat less seriously someone who’s encountered it.  saw quote 93% ICU beds use today AZ.

Edit: may 83%, although yesterday. FL 22 million Large scale commuting really ought go away this, bosses want butts seats. “Some may die, it’s sacrifice I’m willing make...” we've done well treatments common cold. Surprised I’m called gaffe. Touché Thank goodness Rebekah Jones COVID 19 Flordia dashboard. LA usually goes lot around though. I’ve noticed places I’m paying now, much much nicer. Ey?? Iol Correct.
Today way worse testerday.
Stay safe ya'll!  hate ""that guy"" thread job literally looking pricing America virtually every market change except far. right. Nothing dropped yet

Ill admit one thing wrong thinking Corona depression would bring pricing housing, apartments, auto etc....Prices literally budged despite 40-50 million work. cant figure   guess economic downturn disruption tourism causes create breathing room housing market once. Makes glad homebody travel summer. takes lot politician admit wrong. commend noticed lower prices around parents live burbs, much change places would actually cool live like oak sf lowered rent 750.00. still pay time even pay. know working too. using pandemic get free ride right  “Hurrrrr it’s cuz testing durrrrr!” head hurts trying understand everyone hates masks much. pretty much understood NJ going wear mask indoors anywhere public. Restaurants open outdoor requiring masks seated go bathroom. wild me. Arizona also hit hard. hearing hospitals close capacity well. also hope Amy Acton resigning Ohio mean bad things state. medical journal called ""Duh"". Wtf that’s insane. know people make little rent south example insane. Like said 500k south literally build house looks like NBA player lives there.  apartment dc claimed rent controlled raised one year $250 bc going rate city size apartment said. moved actual rent controlled apartment rent increased like $20 year year China owns small portion reddit. I'm sure 400,000 person troll farms objective. see elderly especially vulnerable. also killed servants, wealthy all. Eventually stopped working wealthy people worked women's hospital infected another 25 people. leader. We're rudderless. don’t care truth is? lol - good looking things real numbers aren’t reported?

This went worst thing world everybody reopening shit / holiday. People caring getting haircuts drinks “flattening curve”...  need least 5 million tests per day, known since April Trump said would reach level “very soon.”

Also, tracing efforts still need all. 

And enough PPE, ventilators ICU beds critical areas.

We actually need focused response, willingness enforce distancing hard-hit areas, without stupid telling ranchers Montana need wear masks. Question, living Westwood? extremely overpriced. considered West LA, Palms, Koreatown, even Valley? school back running, 1 bus ride get campus depending apartment located. lived Sherman Oaks attending UCLA took 734 Rapid everyday. information today was:
* 220.600 people sick
* 35.200 active cases.
* 369 critic smedical state
* 3600 deaths total. rent went up... Haters gonna hate.   like beef jerky depends European country comparing to... 5.9% NZ economy 11% Italy's economy much bigger country.

Meanwhile 20% tourists Australia opened soon. Australians able go elsewhere they'll make lot difference. Meanwhile tourism US 9%. town well Indiana. show info isn’t even ballpark flu don’t believe it. amount brainwashing mind blowing. think 35s thought unable catch virus, willing sit home avoid virus likely give us mild symptoms. can’t wash real PPE masks you’re lied government don’t really care shit part resist lock time around. people helm sacrificing lives sake economy. Kind shortsighted honest. body count growing exponentially, people scared shitless go out. could bitten bullet little longer make end. we're going get bad end both. Huge body count failing economy. south great! Thanks asking. Thing is, strategy never rush herd immunity. something attributed Sweden foreign media. save economy.

The idea simply flattening curve measures could sustained long time, thought would perhaps live vaccine found. I’d interested know blood type prevalence region study conducted well relative age individuals said blood types. Correlation equal causation. Great article, thanks sharing! risk mom stepdad live Flagstaff. quit job walk clinic. stepbrother shopping staying put. hope makes this. Oregon myseld cases steadily increasing here. summer going rough. Deflation Doctors experts recommended 1millon tests day baseline testing open up. US started opening 5000k tests/day nationally every expert screaming enough testing.

Hefty fines least wearing masks social distancing heavy fines allowing restaurants businesses sued asses enforcing social distancing. guess that’s country recommends sure Maine sounds right Oregon 2100 1 bed 380 square feet - welcome Cambridge, - real estate expensive Manhattan 🙄 You’re psycho. live. rent increasing Awwwww Psh Dallas growing wildly popular. Housing North Dallas doubled price last 10 years No, actually texas good guidelines, especially beginning. Texas struck good balance livelihood Covid itself. It’s huge state done well considering. That’s simply opinion.  fair, thought read second thoughts liability due indoor spreading rates, decided take outdoors. LivePD? Ah, tried find article beginning pandemic buried. general consensus huge threat since workers taking additional precautions information Covid-19, risk. Hope helps! Dont use place student housing pamphlet overpriced student specialty apartment complexes overcharge deliver. Look places roomate finder my.unt SYMPATHY, BEST LUCK Where'd get number? Top result saw Novartis committed donating 130 million doses. Sanofi 100 million. Bayer, Milan, Teva East find well. Safe say millions doses.

Edit: realized talking googling it. Regardless, I’m sure piece summary together.   looks like kind guy deserves get coronavirus Gods punishment? type say matter XD noteworthy people 35 behaving they're invincible get infected. Hopefully, let reconsider ""invincibility."" Great news true - wait news every country 5-15% population infected except india.. pay 2500 650. Weird flex 💪 wanna cry Everything always race issue. Total projection. sides. No, not. oppressive wild imaginings posters sub jerking idea goosestepping bands social distance police punishing anyone dares step line. 

Like guy said, ""democracy mistake."" that's case, let's it. Let's kind world people subreddit want, people forced live cages, fed fear media daily, longer questioning challenging authority.. ""for good."" 

We've before, that's r/coronavirus wants badly, fine, let's again... let's go full 1984 virus. gonna bag reading comprehension failing comprehend basic sentence? played fool. Neither Trump, ha. Trump love fast food though. still less 20% test positive show symptoms? thing happens home town rural ass Idaho, sad thing county live 30 minutes south first death cases rising home town north confirmed yep publicly acknowledged company case long term care facility. people dismissing state data, claiming masks tyranny still saying flu. put numbers hear locals fake Bill gates, Dr. Fauci tinfoil hat. also believe 99.998% survival rate happily tell it. Meanwhile middle aged overweight people came contact infected picture posted price need pay freedumb. Heads planning finding job there. sister lived Huntington, WV better part 20 years, hard time finding work last year. hire people born raised WV.  happened story? Link work. proving point though. move get job, means moving high price area requires high salaries. 

If people live low cost area pay same. sub change name r/toldyaso 
The time hits front page generally gloating someone might die I’m Mississippi choice. wouldn’t recommend Mississippi. It’s nothing flat land. Northwest Arkansas amazing like Ozark mountains crystal clear rivers lakes. place lived Memphis TN. Wouldn’t recommend city either tho. worked target college loved job. exactly like job? recently - like 90s/early 2000 stop excessively sterilizing black women came fibroids lady issues. We're still regularly denied pain meds (part opioid crisis quite hit us hard still treat us like welfare queens making go children delivered (I speak first hand). It. Is. Not. Just. Tuskeegee. There's LOTS reason black people trust medical industry - saying guinea pigs vaccine going help that. there’s vaccine, things back normal. South Koreans said no, published peer reviewed article MONTHS ago. also reported indeed immunity contraction. Maybe try friends actual cops instead believing everything read leftist websites.

You understand irony sentence. ranked 20th cases per capita US, missing something?

Edit Lombardi .93% Arizona .56% People forget airconditioning new reason south never rise weird. People guns, kevlar vests, pepper spray, batons, sunscreen, even mosquito repellant, protect virus scientist, doctor, government official told to. Follow leader, wear red hat. call us sheep. Sigh. Fucking r/Masks4All No, that's problem all. protesters employers forcing everyone close. People catching beach.. happening right live tv work make go back. think possibility needing ICU bed enough scare morons. INTENSIVE CARE UNITS. Patients admitted ICUs life death situation. Covid fucking flu.  think took persona Hulk Hogans music video

[the whole thing supremely awesome, segment wonder laws fails enforce. great comptent governor. would surprised. Poes law law reason. Leopard ate face hehe stations talking left wing protests saying awesome there's risk

lol, real thing. Nice projection tho. Wanna take big guess way sheriff votes?? Seriously, need clarification this. berate stupidity. 🙈

Someone told day reading numbers reported cases wrong. 

When numbers listed as

(#of cases) (#recovered) (#of deaths)


Is (#of cases) cases reported since covid began reporting. active number cases would 
(#of cases) - (#recovered) - (#deaths)
Or
Is (#of cases) amount currently active cases?



Hope makes sense. makes huge difference need know specific county figure want go back work. 


Thanks taking time. come 25% prevalence assumption? unbelievable quickly Joe bit truther bait. Despite hosting several scientists earliest days Stay Home, *chomp.*

Having access testing via Dana White via POTUS... context completely broken. sure downvoted. Asian countries ""only sick wears masks"" like SG. That's numbers go Yeah, double whammy. least flu cannot combine COVID 19 create superstrain. agree point conflating masks re-opening businesses. think psychologically, opening businesses feels people like relax everything back normal. want much.

I’m trying wrap head around people would refuse wear masks, don’t get point view.  Tha amount people pissed governor, especially downstate, ridiculous. Obviously faking numbers staying rising instead going down? Same. Nothing do. zero balance credit card banked $10k savings last couple months. might remodeling contractor coming next week. block parties talking about? that? number really significant? long mortality rate change age groups, it'll means people 35 more. Population growth probably lot rental market staying strong. Supply demand dictate price. case went protesting.... Thank you, Doctor. happy cake day! also get paid handsomely stating elementary facts these? hope Zonies dont come SoCal beaches bring covid them. Oh perfect. found number right moment context relationship metrics policies place national/state level. 

I expect later giving us different number begins trend rest numbers? can't make claim like without lots specifics. Annual tax increases vary lot heaps ""it depends."" talking commercial property, I'll go limb presume any.

However prevalence disease low majority positive results false positive simply many true positives. 

Let’s consider example. essay sensitivity specificity 99% prevalence 1%. 1,000,000 tests. 10,000 true positives since know prevalence (1%). 9,900 tests come back positive (99% sensitivity). 990,000 true negatives (remember prevalence), 9,900 come back positive specificity 99% (meaning 1% false positives). together 19,800 positive tests, 1/2 false positives.

Given example, reconsider case 25% prevalence. estimate 25% pretty close without adjusting error rates assay, studies anyway.  Believe me, teachers worried well.

Nah, I'm nice guy. go, cambridge university, answering exactly asked for.

Source: modelling scenarios, routine facemask use 50% population reduced COVID-19 spread R less 1.0, flattening future disease waves allowing less-stringent lockdowns.
Viral spread reduced people adopted masks public. 100% mask adoption combined on/off lockdowns prevented disease resurgence 18 months required possible vaccine.   
The models suggest – sooner better – policy total facemask adoption still prevent second wave even isn’t instigated 120 days epidemic begins (defined first 100 cases).
The team investigated varying effectiveness facemasks. Previous research shows even homemade masks made cotton t-shirts dishcloths prove 90% effective preventing transmission.
The study suggests entire population wearing masks 75% effectiveness bring high ‘R’ number 4.0 (the UK close lockdown) all way 1.0, even without aid lockdowns.

So, wrong cloth masks useful based study, shall look this.

*One week later* 

“Boris Johnson tested positive COVID-19”

*queue ‘Curb Enthusiasm’ music* I'm saying that. main point matter what, essentially starts getting symptoms infectious, try isolate symptoms get bad talk doctor. That’s completely wrong. Herd immunity accelerated vaccines something infects everyone herd immunity comes immediately assuming immunity infection.

There’s also evidence permanent damage vast vast majority standard flu infections. Wtf difference getting one wearing one. think lots peer pressure. I’m saying anything said wrong, Facebook comments people know personally verify accounts aren’t fake. They’re taking situation super super seriously. Except avian flu lethal people take precautions die quick Intentionally lying public increasing spread pandemic resulted hundred thousand deaths bit extreme too. dont understand governement cant forbid sale masks private person untill enough all? 
I sure every developt state would sorr emergency protocoll things like turns all. use terms rights interchangeably Rights, thing. sure downvoted yea.

At peak pandemic 2 months ago test taking 7-10 days prioritization severe cases shorter period. closer 2-4 days day (maybe Abbott, maybe slightly inaccurate) severe/hospitsl cases. Getting closer day day make significant difference knowing wait.

I think possible, question effort put option. Tough leadership say testing important.

South Korea living life normal us example get to, test more. potentially better since US many countries larger less population dense.  absolutely incredible. huge, huge numbers hard wrap head around it.

WA state seemed close past week. could seen coming? Rents absolutely dropped NYC. price buy dropping slightly rental market stayed same. Somehow partner apartment downtown Portland $899 got increase year too.... point places went whole curve. see end result already it’s NY already had. named want look.

If never shut end like Spain UK. NY reopening nothing happening shut late already ripped through. 

Natural herd immunity comes far vaccine herd immunity. super spreaders get exhausted early high contact people well.

States locked early like Cali others less international travel like south haven’t happen yet.

Add fact likely one properly washing sanitizing daily 7-14 masks, 1 2, causing grow bacteria make wearer ill, masks going cause sickness solve, especially since studies support use *assuming proper use* happening all. people symptoms wear them. live street parking bare compared last 7 years.

Everyone pretty good wearing masks stores won’t let enter without it. yet see anyone refuse, think people know would publicly shamed. However, people definitely lot relaxed social distancing. Lots groups eating together, restaurants packed outdoor tables lines seated. Obviously one wearing mask eat leave started allowed out. Makes believe mask use become less less time continues :/  Coastal California also see tons people wearing going wearing mask event? saw huge number protestors well trying respect social distancing possible. Also, outside...none 3 going case rally. 

You know churches often linked “Super Spreader” events? dozens maybe hundreds people packed tight quarters, singing etc. Trump rally going tens thousands, screaming, indoors 0 social distancing I’m willing bet 10% mask utilization. know Trump won’t wearing one.

Wait, like Tik Tok this? I’m conflicted. Protesters (not rioters small demographic) wear masks. People states insist opening early insist wearing masks. much likely they're spreading it. new n-word something? racists creative. Well, hopefully dies it. Nobody knows long term impact mild case is. Nobody.

It’s literally not. think replying different comment? forgive that. make mistakes sometimes. say reinfection possible. reported positive PCR results patients discharged reinfection. also report immune contraction, said people produce antibodies. Antibodies equal immunity. 

A reinfection no-reinfection infected completely recovered patient way determine immunity. Nothing else give definitive answer. Stay safe. paranoid hypotheses, servers greatest risk right given exposure general public.

 Currently, I'm less concerned exposure dingus coworkers nigh infinite number dingus patrons currently flooding restauraunts.

The drug test group reduced deaths segment (those ventilator support) 27ish%.

That’s slightly better eliminating one third deaths segment.

Alabama 52% COVID-19 deaths 6/6 - 6/12 (93) 5/16 - 5/22 (61).

5/23 - 5/29 (68) 37% Karma comes full circle. hindsight pretty much said February.

Normal people living communal setting elderly fragile population. might well cruise ship. well run hospitals function differently different purpose. Also, whole reason people sent home hospital hospital communal setting (less nursing home) large number people (this bad SARS-COV-2 attack rate/superspreader effect) whereas home likelihood not. Attack rate 10% families 6% SARS-1 put 20 families together attack rate SARS-COV-2 going approach 90% (probably number interactions increase well, would need model see study R1 something like 14 cruise ship). ships bad, carrier, cruise ships well large gatherings like church assemblies meat packing plants. incidence goes mean viral load person gets also severity increases mean viral load transmit, average. things go bad holy shit fast situations.

I say dedicated nursing homes SARS-COV-2 infections. relatively atomized isolation wards/accommodations, matter expensive pay 10 times least grand scheme things. spike lockdown anyway space somewhere. preserve ICU space reduce community spread spread among health care professionals.

I would need see data case SARS-COV-2 getting nursing home might want evacuate like would cruise ship instances. It’s ludicrous saying “I freedom drink drive car home”. freedom much don’t harm someone else. Hahahahahaha, choke MAGAt. saying afford buying expensive daily masks, provided free option.

Not sure much washable cloth masks cost Canada, get 4 pack Amazon less $20. cost week's worth masks prices, could endless washable supply.

Target, McDonalds, Walmart, etc convinced us couldn’t possibly pay people *real* wages continue business - massive tax breaks mind you. say let die then, either they’re full shit funneling every penny legally upwards, don’t deserve exist labor afford enough live on.

Seriously, think it’s ok pay less skilled, students, younger people garbage wages ask amount time work ethic? much Target make last year? fair all? U.S.: can't wear mask! personal freedoms.

We saw one-time checks Congress sent out: many people bank accounts, pay taxes, address. mess. 

And saw unemployment offices: offices typically received 2,000 claims week suddenly seeing 120,000. designed scale like asking to.

And saw Paycheck Protection Program: banks simply prepared accept vet applications tens hundreds thousands businesses.

Americans deserve better. deserve government works, responsive issues 21st century.

Every citizen US bank account assigned birth. special bank account: allows government put cash whenever want. fucking around private banks trying extract profits people dated software. pay taxes putting money authorizing government withdrawal.

Every business also receive bank account register. serve purposes.

And instead individuals applying unemployment, automatically enrolled hours reduced laid off. wasting time applying it. order lay off, business notify government reduction hours, reason, any. automatically triggers unemployment affected employee.

None particularly hard stuff. Payments automated. get US back track responsive 21st century issues. mean fudging data, failing distinguish antibody tests?

Personally, think see spikes protests sometime 1st week 3rd week July. may protesters end seeking care, it’s everyone spread spread could case another wave.

This virus moves slow, lag time, time spread show symptoms, get tested, bad enough seek medical treatment.

Sincerely, 
a Texan  $3k/month rent 1% studied extensively viruses, mostly influenza. According one study ranking effectiveness various masks, even strip pillow case 70% effectiveness. Put another way, reduced viral transmission 70%.

So two people standing next briefly, say duration cough, wear crudest least effective mask experiment, chance transmission drops 9% relative masks. using strips pillow cases. one parties surgical masks, n95, better, 9% drops close zero. massive benefit little cost effort.

If medical worker taking many exposure events day long yes, N95 better offer good protection, mask goggle would required.

But talking trying prevent public spreading via brief encounters. principle covering mouth sneezing. offer 100% protection everyone? No, reduce transmission.

EDIT: sure made clear point kind disagreeing -- crude cloth mask protect significant extent well everyone else see begged STOCKING position.

I thought maybe done well wording similar. recalled quiz question specifically ref. issue.

This course 2, Calculating Isolation Quarantine long case isolated others? Well, short answer ideally long infectious. longer answer. know time they're diagnosed, may already sick, time investigating case, infectious period already started, probably least days before. **So need talk isolating duration infectious period**. They'll monitor symptoms day help determine they're still infectious they've recovered. remember, **they'll need isolate least 10 days symptom onset, know symptoms improving fever three days.""**

This quiz talking Pat, tested positive COVID-19 tells symptoms began May 10. regular follow call May 20, report fever 4 days symptoms completely gone, still feel little able safely end isolation ten days passed since symptoms Waiting least 10 days onset symptoms one criteria stopping isolation instructions. case's symptoms must also **have improved** fever must ended without use medications least three days able safely end isolation ten days passed since symptoms began, fever ended 3 days ago rest symptoms **have continue stay isolation since still showing Even case lingering symptoms (e.g., fatigue), able end isolation long meet apologize isolation long. could stopped isolating soon fever went case must isolate least 10 days onset symptoms, cannot end isolation unless fever least 3 days without medication symptoms **are improving**.

The accompanying slide actually least 10 days symptoms onset **and** symptoms **have resolved.""**

They used three different terms: improving, improved, resolved (which sounds like ended, me).

Option C best explains contradiction says ""Even case lingering symptoms (e.g., fatigue), able end isolation long meet criteria.""

I suppose depends symptoms whether considered person still infectious symptoms improving 100% gone (excluding fever adamant 3 days must passed without one using medication). 

For mild illness, Coursera says signs symptoms last 10 days. severe illness, 2 weeks more. 

Where fevers end later return, prolonged symptoms seem going away all, answer still infectious becomes murkier examples linked articles clap them, it'll fine... masks meant prevent people spreading virus talking/coughing/sneezing. People touching masks fuck anything.  blatant trolling point.

Just wear fucking mask. can't pay mortgage? going blame bank? heroes ""no lockdown crew""! mention it, need versions heads state cursing constituents wearing masks going haircuts (like one said ""yeah hair looks great, great closed casket""). Also require government supply everyone multiple cloth masks. proper use mask requires remove wash **as soon home**.

 go day washed dry, need new one. anything else unsafe extremely potent breeding grounds bacteria.

Everyone know, 1 mask wash maybe every couple days, gross going make sick. also can't afford go buy 3,4,5 masks. 2nd highest infection rate 7th highest death rates.

I guess interpret based entirely view Swedish strategy general. wear god damn mask shut fuck already. really hope this. roommate works Best Buy. reopened week, apparently allowed enforce wearing masks, despite county requiring it. fucking backwards. hoping state requires it, Best Buy change attitude. policy endangering me, really pissed off. already fortunate survive first time this. Hopefully recovers, goes show pandemic way far over, people need start taking actions prevent spread virus. literally parents subject facility Illinois. facetime father several times week. mostly isolated room since March, even able visit mother BUILDING. (My mother's dementia bad, capable kind video chat phone call without assistance. reminded daily remain isolation - isolation last year 3 months due c.diff infection. )

POGGERS Finally encouraging news? would sure love afford rent. whole South is. rushed reopening phases even got chance determine things looking. Many people arent taking seriously, arent wearing masks, elected officials refusing anything it. 

It's total clusterfuck. Damn, can't believe cut pic :\  Canadian ....

It didn't. always way. Always. beginning. I'm blaming spread young people. pointing naïve young adults infection, even guaranteed, still cause serious damage said young adults. Look what's going current hotspot states US... like headline says covid-19 patients becoming younger younger. (as obviously didn’t hear first time) less time Reddit, time reading researching, failing that, maybe take hobby, bc trolling isn’t really working far. Birdwatching maybe? Crochet? hear paint numbers revival lately I... one thought, little dark. People attending church - especially large churches megachurches - generates revenue. makes money. Sometimes vast amounts money. Actually, perhaps often. Church... business, even law pretends not.

When people congregate en masse, then... money made.

I... honestly cannot ignore that, know? according usinflationcalculator, $4,800 1996 (when happy gilmore released) worth $7,843.79 today. I'd say big check ok

that said, giant $1000 check comical Jokes them... check emails... I'm sure hundreds us don't. well said. would appear tin foil hat cutting circulation little brain cells left. God speed. threat school shootings. Right. tons tests found inaccurate. There’s reason standards I’ve noticed trend multiple areas.

The really elderly (think frail elderly) almost always wear masks. Middle aged 60s/early 70s? Usually don’t wear Nope, hope everyone wear masks play kissy face clubs pandemic break races, sentence essentially says everyone economic class worried getting Corona virus? Like Caucasians poor, middle class, afraid getting it? citation this, instead anecdotal evidence? 

What racist, generalizationing bullshit?
All creating weird racial segregating narrative races create divisiness road. sad indeed, evidence provided say otherwise healthy underlying risk? news me, Midwest, rent risen past couple months I’ve looking place. see viral load phrase pop ton disagree wholeheartedly. source could read per chance? 

Whether exposed 10ng virus 10ug virus irrelevant. specific epigenetic response virus matters talking ability infect proliferate people. Someone could infected 100ug virus still exhibit symptoms infect others strong epigenetic response viruses, meaning body develops antibody rapidly kills virus higher rate reproduction rate. Someone could also infected 1ng virus develop COVID-19 due weak epigenetic response. virus laughs luck. send catapults, like old days? S.O.S. new yorkers come Florida worst. talk shit Florida day would never go back NY. really think Florida smug are. Yes Floridian proudly say dislike New Yorkers tremendously helps cytokine storms, since basically immune system nuking body kill infection. would play covid disease serious mild cases? suppression exist. nice cities. Imagine knew Mesa AJ. Run far away, did. That’s works school district except you‘re separated based grade, kids higher marks tend behave better. According Wikipedia, definition ""microstate"" (the countries usually excluded data this) depend population area population, I'd say 100K good cutoff point. Abbott useless giving guidance issues related public safety pandemic. Apparently, Bexar County officials dissected orders found backdoor way issue order everyone wear mask, can't fine anyone follow order.

""Abbott Congratulates Counties Solving Clever Mask Riddle""

- This

I instantly pigeonhole people hear listen garbage  Oh yes, let’s hope people die 🙄 likely family thing. Can’t bum Funtime forget exists! I'm sorry. really sucks. Masks may effective, actually reading study, inferences bit weak.

For one, infections already dropping specific areas cite, mask wearing became mandatory, especially given supposed 1-2 week lag behavioral changes results.

Second, they're considering infections, deaths. one still good explanation mortality rate continues drop even infections continue skyrocket certain areas. haven’t read articles you? Ppl forget. That's got Trump. course nothing Congress follow McCain shot reform. 99.5% chance can. That's 50 hour/month? That's pay pretty decent pay education Sweden. regards death, long isn’t obese diabetic he’s probably within 97-99% “safe”. Doesn’t mean won’t get super sick long term issues.

I still wouldn’t want roll 100 spot wheel 1-3 spots resulting demise... entirely. also depends others wear masks too. Also eye protection also necessary droplets absorbed eye mucus. uneducated religious folk ruining community see here. There’s reason congregate donation procurement. $15 hour well poverty. Stop drama! disturbing much happened last 14 days. I'm proud work Illinois done bringing case counts down, still 5-600 cases day, many states 14 days ago. means take long erase investment public health (2 months lockdown.) really hope find clusters happen, instead surprised ""oh hey doubled cases week, that's weird...""

It seems like happen fast. really hope mask wearing help. cannot shut again. kind shit head mom raise? Cant seen caring toher boyfriends? Nothing says legit attorney like ill fitting white linen suit. Well killed grandma legitimate grievance. No, I've wearing mask following social distancing rules. think reddit needs get rid u since u r piece shit :) Exactly. guess burned looted business owners well.  Dems disgusted this. neighbor doors political staunch dem. said refuses vote this.  supports BLM. stated anarchy. vote Trump riots hurt end. Sweden’s economy without lockdowns? Prosperous? allowed? wear one Ever wanted way quickly find person cases people?

We right know percentage.

I'm kind depressed.  Retail/public facing vs. warehouse even best comparison. work target corporate offices probably working remotely home exposed want be. ""not front line"" people. enjoy someone scan items rather self-checkouts struggle 5x time. RFID could push car through, would top choice. Companies haven’t done cashiers cheaper now. antibody, it. Unless virus mutates quickly something unrecognizable, immune system keep COVID-19 library. concrete. 

However...

It's possible people may develop antibodies, late, major difference illness severity far understand. also genetic weaknesses people whatever reason people type blood especially hard time. Presumably, COVID-19 uses another virus help spread. Sort like piggyback.This common viral world may explain differences symptom severity. 

Like said, lots unknowns. Wash hands, wear face mask. understand over, great one's mentality, life. 

This sucks - way around it. Splendid job sir. Keep faith! (Moron) Kazakhstan number one exporter potassium; Central Asian countries inferior potassium Comparable racism blacks?

Nazarbayev basically runs everything behind scenes, directly, Tokayev made decisions Nazarbayev would probably disliked.

(As regional observer neighbouring Kyrgyzstan.) Worse, knew would happen fine it. projecting blame onto citizens. Can’t spend 10mill gets corona wearing mask. Glad NYPD cracking non-mask wearers. Theyve tested arent positive. Don’t know live in, new China capitalistic would ever dream of. Koch brother’s vision embodied labor unions social safety nets. Good points, nation wide lockdowns likely never happen again. also account amount disinformation (it’s flu, hoax, bad... ect). agree everything said. However can’t see us hammering upward trend fast March April. However overwhelming majority people start wearing masks could change that. Wow, u r nuts. Thanks correction. actually thought moved official convention. anyone called selfish grandma killer yet? fair, ""Florida Man"" stories, culprit usually ""North Eastern Transplant Man"". catchy name. 

People New York New Jersey fled back Florida states got strict. Florida's governor pandered are. That's fucked up. really hope get well soon. unless you’re florida they’ve opened everything. don’t get it’s bad idea vague idea freedom. americans selfish fuck (american here, confirm) Yeah, everyone forgets ruined healthcare. Yet, praised time. fair, quite time *after* election. time, sounded like fairly standard kinda-corrupt local politician, like many get voted higher office. Probably best person D's could put up, DeSantis exactly favors credibility area race, either. labeled misleading title. disappointing perhaps short lived reaction non-existent science course! You’re good man patriot! riots Northern elites can't tell do! they're saying racism's bad? next, meth bad too? Socialists downfall everything south loves America! Yeah, won’t surprised trump wins. People get ridiculed supporting trump, that’s u don’t clue many vote election. risk catching reduced 14%, knowing risk catching helpful knowledge. What's number? think do, pay quit job, body gives shit. work.  Calling someone idiot gives shitty behavior. don’t think that’s case here. 

Masks unpopular core voter demographic, he’s resisting them. state spike, knows masks important again, especially large cities. instead passing mask requirement, shoved responsibility onto local leaders. leaders enforce masks, take heat morons. choose to, he’ll point cities say, “that’s done”.

Of course, half-measure he’s putting place also helps dumb arguments anti-masks crowd, probably propagating further, doesn’t care leads deaths. 

He’s idiot. He’s piece shit. theorize done well B.C. large Asian demographic way likely wear masks. Yet proof masks make huge difference unfortunately way many unintelligent ppl world wont two simple tasks, wear masks physical distance others help us get control. totally understand. makes sense. wanted make sure walking around neighborhood something like that. feeling going r/agedlikewine near future know ab extremely anti-mask Physicians Assistant. well, knew.

So Sweden going herd immunity not? Everytime someone mentions Sweden wanting herd immunity bunch Swedes come tell they're wrong, never plan. thread someone like come say herd immunity possible result, everyone's going get eventually, sweden ahead right now, even though that's looking dumber dumber every day goes by.

It's exhausting trying keep talking points. picture attorney hilarious. ""We wear mask 24/7"" 🤣 Wow that's unreal 👏 great price allowed people stadiums. wife making fun wearing mine table taking food came out, peer pressured keeping too. disinformation campaign right wing. strong propaganda machine trying evade responsibility economic disaster caused mishandling Coronavirus response. convince base Coronavirus overreaction hoax place blame economic downturn panicked left wing. Republican leaders wear masks public push administration supress information severity disease. almost like decisive measures causing cases drop... Love moral coercion hon. Honestly, property taxes gone much since bought house. rust belt city even though appreciated ""value"" since bought it, still worth less $100,000, maybe that's why. mortgage payments it, actual expenses (not including repairs whatever damage tenants leave behind) average around $3,000-$4,000/year. part upstate near Albany area never see anyone business without one. saw 1 person wearing one supermarket last week stood much. mean monoclonal antibodies (MABs)? know mean - therapists definitely want continue challenge fall habit avoiding things trigger anxiety. older one’s junior college, successfully moved full online still Zoom calls classes go critiques work (she’s art major) socially don’t think she’ll regress, hard part finding internship eventually job - although think experience she’ll interested kind remote work/hybrid opportunity feasible graphic/web design, she’ll confidence that. younger one high school sophomore school less successful switching online.

That's going take fuck ton work. Like legit labs would need constructed. 

I work small medical lab. get ton samples doctors office well governmental bodies tests. working crazy overtime despite moving 2 weeks backed up. hardly regular stuff- pap smears, std tests, etc. 

Labs best fucking can. greedy pay well should. combined percieved risk many end quitting even bother applying . 

I'm sure get close time soon. weird seeing change. Before, less intelligent people would accept educated people saying. Like doctors professors. days deep distrust anything scientific. I'm sure change happened. true believe it’s British system, violently rebelled against, Crown appoints positions. Back day pool educated people we’re qualified we’re aristocracy thus didn’t necessarily represent commons. Things different though could probably dispense idea bureaucrats elected. Jesus. gonna get bad. MagaVirus! raise rent all, matter many years stay. I'd rather good tenant pays rent crappy tenant higher price suddenly stops paying leaves damage.

Dude needs adapt &amp; evolve times &amp; circumstances present. People make basic comparisons justify ignorant decisions. Disgusting. Disgraceful. put cities. today illegal statewide mandate masks. Within hours lifted, cities acting.

The state still acted. they're longer making illegal cities act. Florida West sure ""The states seeing record-high averages Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Nevada, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Carolina Texas."" elected sheriff answers people end term theoretically better cop got promoted bunch inside answers internal structure. 

There lot elected positions parties attached candidates sheriffs same, preferably. shelf life 2 years. already worthless. Ducey spineless Trumpsucker. ""god guns freedom"" shirt. 

Ugh.

I think confused Jesus Rambo. Americans people rush move 18. Even Europe lot people live parents they’re married. Think much money waste rent every year imagine nice fat stack would bank account. what? live box? Spend time parents (if they’re good people) won’t around much longer. Good karma. recent BLM protests havent helped. ass. renewed lease yesterday rent went $20. see low masks were? even wearing masks? can't blame virus. asking it. Yay! get counties join whole state covered. underrepresented weren’t allowed get tested. sounds ridiculously cheap used San Francisco property values. It’s American thing it’s high population growth short time along high income growth. Housing used desirable suddenly desirable neighborhood changed drastically short time news: water wet Yeah. sad see restaurants may close (they closed before, right?) hard work get ready open again. truly devastating. 

There well second lockdown unless consequences dire. Arizona Sweden, people take ""personal responsibility"" work together prevent disaster. (Sweden well, bad could US.)

Bill Gates said March can't tell people keep buying houses taking vacations, ignore pile bodies there... New York refrigerated trailers. one else US that. Hoping miracle. 

There grace god go I. really hope hockey stick curve happen us months. (Illinois) like virus really, really contagious 😷 Cus u know shit started exploded china.    
They would first see signs antibody,s fading I’m pretty sure photoshopped someone out, looking floor. It’s blurry feet be, polished stone like everywhere else. anyone actually doubt another grift? immunity also imply vaccine. overrun Liberal Media Yep. understand opening soon talk.

Dude idiot. 

Pushes conspiracy theories gives platform kinds idiots frauds. 

What deserve ? announced/commented UFC games ? qualify anything else. Celebrity culture awful. DOH show 80 thousand total cases, another total 90 thousand? Hugely significant. means patient demographic dramatically changing, lot public health officials surmising likely. one three possible reasons mortality curve case curve diverged many places (the case rate going much faster, death rate growing all). two possible reasons -- virus mutating treatment getting better -- either unlikely all, unlikely explain big effect, respectively. attribute to? certainly number total cases.

Virus getting weaker?

People getting Covid-19 less likely die?

Treatment getting better?

A little 2 3? Check Podcast series titled “It Could Happen Here.” It’s bunch episodes regarding civil war could unfold America it’s spot far, scary recorded 2018. Check trailer least; it’s good summary less three minutes think.

Yeah, surreal. have, past weeks,encountered several well meaning individuals informed could suffer CO2 poisoning wearing mask. inform course previous vacations fact worn masks excess 8 hours times auffered one bit. pressed source would say ""a friend healthcare..."". stop misinformation campaign issue especially many people return work states reopen gusto. virus deadly enough total societal collapse. everything we've seen Western world far smallest steps government could take prevent something. 

But ready hospitals overcrowded, anything kill hour, expect given space hospital. injured rushed hospitals soon begin appear stable. rate death debilitation non-COVID diseases, system overwhelmed. 

There could start shortages available labour population gets sicker sicker. especially true jobs older average ages. court system get backed judges able sit bench, first large numbers dead dying, smart ones simply refuse come in. government officials might get sick could cause political instability within government loss important institutional knowledge time important. 

If things start get really bad, state government federal government step something. something know, they'll try keep grocery stores stocked, streets policed, sort aid hospitals. Society break this, it'll pretty shitty meanwhile.  Like would know play chess. Abbott: ""everything's fine, means hospital beds available."" NV - gyms opened weeks ago. 50% capacity mandated state, go further. Every cardio machine turned off, racks spaced apart, lots frequent cleaning, staff masks, locker rooms closed. However, went gym first reopened, absolutely way 50% capacity - looked full before. Nobody distancing, nobody masks (not I'd expect everyone work mask on). pushed back personal training another month they're clearly be. Sticking hiking + trail running awhile longer. Phoenix Gilbert vote this!? pros cons discussing? fucking mask! offense, buy spanish people better job.

Well, hopefully gets developed ""anyone Danish border gets tested"", would huge improvement generally tbh.

That's actually happened Iceland. first, Iceland said could get test within x hours prior departure allowed entry, shortly said that, walked back enter Iceland tested border. Denmark that, actually improve security. ((whoosh))  lottery? make enough money move anywhere want could still keep job. move? I’m happy Michigan... yeah....

I’m fine here. thanks. u/summariser_bot Keep buddy, great! Hooray! Grandpa made another poopy! don’t say lightly, genuinely bad person. Phew, worried know everything golden. Looking curves cases deaths like looking shittiest roller coaster ever. always huge quick run top, long drawn tail lasts 5 times long. 

I hope near top, really doubt it. Unfortunately, looks like Florida long slow descent. mean, income tax rate irrelevant given bonus tax rate. yes need add Medicare SS well. Literal world health experts making comparison. I'm restating it.

You're welcome call world health experts wrong dumb. Sure.

But alternatively think worth considering might information understanding do.

Respiratory diseases hard vaccinate against. Even virus never mutated beyond initial vaccine, unclear immunity confer lasting immunity.

Even tetanus vaccine immunity needs re-upped tetanus contagious. It’s American way. Omg... people want talk over...

No.. dont forgive defending killers..

All time... Dude. Minimum wage still 7.25 / hr. old employer paid 8 haughty thinking “I pay minimum, anyone able live this. need try harder, get raise. Also overtime pay 10, that’s much”. Minimum wage needs minimum livable, boomers saying “oh it’s supposed pocket change teenagers”. mow lawns shit pocket change. full time job books taxed pay living expenses least. Everything bad comes Florida. great unknown bad situation get. NY shutdown contained spread. TX, FL AZ going shutdown all. It'll interesting case study bad unchecked spread epidemic be. Oh already whole line branded masks (not n95) require mask use open / require parks. 

I’m shocked parks aren’t lobbying state mandate they’re getting worst worlds. They’re businesses requiring masks businesses affected news stories rising cases. 

Side note, local theme park sites overrun comments carrying empty drink cup day pretend drink leave mask off. People would rather lose use one arm wear something face. i’m ohio bad lot states. part people wear masks common see some
people without. social distancing still enforced mask still required places workers places customers things pretty good here. haven’t heard anyone catching corona pretty easy get tested i’ve heard rent increase limit Philly apparently. think less common cities declining population.

""Sweden excess death rate normal time year"" :)

That ridiculous. Either normal death rate excess deaths. 
Excess death rate per definition deaths normal. Well I'm saying I'm general drugs think might work situation Say want live state city wanting walkback lockdowns restrictions instead pushing masks. killers apologists..

Why not? Asking people grew shit education state known stupidity racism common sense long shot.

As someone grew Alabama none things knows lot people good people, fuck broad brush, asshole.

Got it, president says something dumb, hold it. cdc says something dumb, treat like child making mistake.. ooohh okay sweetie, ones perfect!

I get saying, cdc saying masks useless dumbest thing i've heard pandemic. lol I'm going say country testing much (especially little we've testing), strict lockdown had, combinded (as gave statistics about) widely available testing lead lower percentage positive tests.

Up week regular people Stockholm region, outbreak worst country, could get tested even mild-to-moderate symptoms. testing earlier preserved people severe symptoms, hospital/elderly home personell. testing severe cases leads higher percentage positive tests, logically.

It's failure obviously, point view shows little actually tested worst Mars/April, rather giving implication spread current moment. Compare Trump's quote ""[If stop testing right now, we'd cases, simply test enough peak, peak instead showed ICU death statistics.

No pissing contest obviously :) I'm avid amateur statistician well course, feel important put statistics proper perspective. Maybe know ""Lies, damned lies, statistics"" quote popularised Mark Twain.

And said I'm trying argue took right path, earlier said discussions must wait pandemic start comparing statistics thorougly. lot factors play. rise cases results new rise deaths later - course eat words.

Stay strong, danska bröder och systrar! Every comment Reddit read understanding idea actually wrote disregarding children completely, Sweden still failed miserably handling epidemic. elderly. 

No actually *is* mostly elderly. 

Sweden didnt lockdown currently 190 casualties 60 country 10.3 million population. Sweden looked ""worse case scenario"" sorts happens dont lock down, right?

And result - Surprisingly young people die, hospitals overrun.

But lot seniors died bad policies.

So look Country like Canada, lockdown. results? Surprisingly young people died, hospitals overrun.

But lot seniors died bad policies. week fists fly.

48 hours Karens strike.  agree on. see good pathways better situation. hope one develops, course, see one now. Could temporary employee. sick leave called easy fire. people following rules therefore less people currently infected.

But people decide there’s nothing worry about, quicker get hand again. There’s difference planned reopening whatever fuck want think it’s hoax Funny thing he’s named preventable disease, seems want spread disease. C’mon, Nebraska. ignorance become political issues. one side trying slow virus based science, side  bunch asshole spreaders listen politicians instead science. oh no, punishment officials wearing situations should, MUCH higher think going vote either today tmrw. know mayor said way tho. Disappointing. benjamins. Sure fast food chains national retailers really sink swim based employees. employees another resource company manage. 

In small business, individual employees really matter. salary might line item budget continued work job satisfaction might key one areas company's work.

In fast food chain, big box retail store, whatever, entire restaurants/locations really matter. company care fuck employee #23 location #2124? employee matter even little, except maybe insofar major fuckup employee get company sued. Shit, location may barely even matter. mention employee unimportant instantly replaced. 

The lesson try find way corporate environment small business. Wishing corporate act irrationally likely accomplish anything wishing sky would turn green. guess *genuinely* believed Tegnell co. kept saying herd immunity coming April, May, June. many comments pro-Swedish strategy brigade 'Swedes safest let country since we'll immune summer'. 

Otherwise could partially Swedish Exceptionalism: 'even though pursued path whole world warned us against, there's way negative consequences could come us'. 

Or classic excuse (often rooted reality) ""we naive"". 

Well, whatever explanation quite astounding one seemed factored possibility in. they're acting like they're bullied perfectly rational decision made neighbors keep (most) out. Apologies, directed you. thread comments going back forth politicians feel masks. Im saying ignoring listening experts, better worse.

The thing felt watched stuff took place Asia saw people wearing masks - decades. ""Yeah. Asia crowded want catch spread shit. wear masks.""


We want catch spread shit. wear masks. Apparently Americans stupid voluntarily.  Usually change like means either:

1) Greatly increased testing capacity finally showing results

2) change classify case: could started counting symptom-based diagnosis case rather counting confirmed positive test results. maybe talk therapist. pandemic isn’t going last forever. Everyone needs make sacrifices greater good. They’re getting entire 4 6 year degrees online. would one quick year.  Agreed. It’s simple say “We don’t know masks help. research needed make recommendation.” leaves door open giving sound advice later. Giving conflicting advice thousand times worse admitting ignorance.

-They totally convinced ""just flu"" based crappy data ""gut feelings"" went international consensus describe (2% mortality). Giesecke thought IFR going ridiculously low, like order 0.1% even lower maybe. NEVER made damn sense since theory would require disease asmptomatic carriers, also proposed several models *while time* telling public asymptomatic carriers big problem. also, reason guess also based ""hunches"" think confer durable, sterliziing immunity even though there's hard data durable meaningful immunity *now* let alone back March decided insanity. one explanation arrogant, foolish, thought gut feelings right. 

-Another possible explanation Giesecke, one chief architects strategy (he calls Tegnell Wallersten ""guys"" hired / mentored both) stands personally profit quite handsomely creating bunch sick disabled people: http://archive.vn/ps1Ti Nothing proven front, ofc hard raise eyebrow hairline that.

There specualtions I've heard. None good. first situation likely one think, maybe dash corrupt pushing Giesecke. crazy, keep seeing misconception sub. People repeat repeat think that's fact.

But yes, secondary agenda highlight healthy underlying health risks remain largely safe, personally, Covid.

That saying without personal risk responsibility do, otherwise, bother treating diseases all... let sick person die. want socialized health care. want us help risk. go think mass lock was/and remains ineffective tool, different question.

Before Memorial Day county government ran social media ads places like Fresno urging tourists stay away - cause people come thought beach crowded.

Overall stores I've seen I'd estimate 20-30% mask usage. votes denying this? Pyramids, Great Wall, Moon landing impossible tasks

No they’re not. Designing vaccine much harder task making pyramids. examples terrible.

A lot people still think virus three modes: asymptomatic (30-60%), bad flu (most), extremely sick (rare).

And look that, assess known risks, decide roll dice. 

But COVID-19 looks complicated that. Asymptomatic people *disease free.* studying closely. treat like bad flu. 

We know people still experiencing disease even symptoms recovered even they're symptomless. still struggling clotting blood? experiencing asymptomatic organ injury compensated failure? 

I think common understanding disease think many people cannot accurately assess risks. Nothing gets Canada excited like new way polite. they'll think twice spitting strangers pandemic. This, undocumented immigrants. People still forced go work live close quarters family/workers. people pick peppers lettuce.

Pls add.. lets measure broke ass circus case JoJo) got notice halfway lease possibility, gave week

So long exactly truck sitting flat? can't tell wording. Nobody. Remember defund police? Played us like damn fiddle!! silly thing say. ""staying"" lot longer years. Even bubonic plague still around. I've going local co-op. first store around put new safety protocols raise workers pay alternative app give everyone useful wearable, sports watch proximity sensor example. watch would store UUID along date contact within 2 meters . test positive would hand information, NHS would use UUID's get registered users contact information. SNFs decimated. Governors mandating take Covid19 patients incredibly bad decision. I've watching IRL streaming couple past week Vegas. pay enough visit time soon. Rarely anyone mask on, pretty much workers, people ignoring social distancing. weekdays looked better, fewer people out, weekend insane. Like nothing changed. .. ""eating meat"" prove? 

I mean, going moralize stuff, moralize ""eating meat"" thing?

Because find hard lectured meat-eaters subject ""empathy"", y'know? Corozona time Neighbouring scandinavia?  entire time saw plenty California people social distancing wearing masks (from driving around). would abide closures, saw birthday parties 35+ people without masks local park even though closed off. thing stopping people businesses actually shut down. Otherwise, people tried live life normal unfortunately. Businesses enforce masks. weeks sanitized carts. mostly it. Last heard scottsdales mayor said no? would wear mask outdoors. Risk low others around also masked you’re good. ....ok? protests really stupid idea political rallies. threat absolutely come cashiers they’re masked, haven’t done deep dive Spain guess climate (at least according know time) factor, Spain gets pretty hot hot hard hit areas US, heat dry heat since interior semi-arid dry Mediterranean. Looking data Madrid summer looks similar Rapid City, people Madrid probably don’t stay inside much people Phoenix Houston. Going metric, see US great too. business opening up! look numbers! realize scab. case, way average intelligence clotted blood. special word spam true? call, acknowledge entirely call make mayor.

It'll interesting see well observed course. 🤢 someone sort study masks effectiveness. Oh wait, are. it’s published. Fool. Oh need worry manufacturing, Astra Zenca already it. I'm assuming enough make big dent thing Western World whenever feel ready. Trump election, everyone wants resume normal life here. Every day get back normal probably worth billion dollars global economy. think feature like one many things health agency/developer implement. Google Apple created framework. Nordic countries could actually look back past 3 months pragmatic lens, weigh humongous burden placed society worth thousand elderly people delayed catching CV. 

What find disingenuous outrage thrown Sweden, coming mostly countries speak implementing policy mirrors strategy. 

At best decision lockdown delayed inevitable. long period time now, viable vaccine. countries already opening up, soon accepting tourists business travelers, plus opening bars venues. 

By August countries put notion CV lockdown firmly rearview. Back business usual, virus spreads. point righteous indignation become hypocrisy. respect views quarantine you’re getting tourists. explicitly, says so, tourists. Denmark made trade off. opinion good bad, except it’s political game. It’s easy. patients strict lockdowns, visitors, full PPE times, masks patients, group activity still catching dying covid.


This virus perfect storm long term care centers. Wait, implying believe increase positive cases nothing increased access testing? Joe Rogan joke. can't believe number people tune listen ridiculous (and ever-changing) bro-science opinions stuff. flat earth Fauci talking about? fairness, got covid (that know of) stress situation absolutely changed way dream. believe people said last time ""Florida going get slammed"", people thought false weeks later nothing happened. 

I think ""two - three week see impact"" statement misleading people latched onto that. think four even six weeks see impact mass gatherings, virus moving affected population takes time hit critical mass sudden cases everywhere. 

You need worry thousands people crowding beaches bars, need worry infections working way though asymptomatic people freely algorithm large enough start see massive infection once. 

That's wacky idea. zero deaths covid-19, we? done 'lockdown' that's especially extreme punitive. 1665) barricading people homes posting guards. Retrospectively, probably stricter elderly allowed general movement masks no-contact processes that's using benefit information time. shutdown give us time learn hone response, agree lockdowns systemic crude method. quarantine word Italian medieval period refers 40 days isolation period Plague. time-tested public health response that's public health equivalent playing traffic, closing roads hurricane want use analogy. control virus without it? Hopefully, still figuring out. No, masks - every country nearly beat COVID also realized stale recirculated air time spent indoors near infected individual source outbreaks. Offices public transport found major vectors, hear much either one U.S. 

In many places new outbreaks, offices open restaurants. Recent published research points airborne transmission leading cause outbreaks. 

The U.S. seem interested true contact tracing sharing information. news media bleats protests, beaches, restaurants one three proven major source outbreaks. Offices even come up. Public transportation rarely has.

I always love particular study infection spread example Indoors. Smaller volume air. Time exposure. That's mayor. 😭 Illinois state mandates face masks stores restaurants? Bengals win (for change) two coughs... logical contextual basis evaluating information, avenues make judgements. still idea systemic repurcussions virus are. We're seeing reports young people 'recovered' still hardly walk stairs, irregular heartbeats, fertility issues etc. entire generation people could really serious lifelong health issues - would certainly impactful labor availability. He’s got “dying” part right. Translation....the season begin fall 2021, assuming vaccine. largely due procurement funding relates studies. tend forced findings order keep funding and/or job. So, pseudo studies results muddy water. find dozens studies tell butter good bad you. decent oversight many 'scientists' doctor results paycheck. http://imgur.com/a/WSsvVLr

OC 1/10 cases LA. 58 counties California. wasnt one single county (LA), California would lowest per capita rate country, almost half cases 1/58th counties.  dude, pretending issue hugely concentrated LA help anyone. South oc. North oc still wear masks. Senicide omg that's true! Love - stealing it! China knows something that’s sure. banned autopsies coronavirus cases strange reason. Head Mi6 38 years came recently suggest evidence accidentally spread Wuhan lab. Maybe he’s trying save money areas don’t mandate mask usage since hardest hit. Wow really doubling this. Ok.

No. killing Tcells makes HIV deadly immune system. unchecked replication mutation virus Tcells Tcells explode. **Find one article supports claim: ""The effect immune system therefore similar.""**

Additionally, 4 types Tcells. HIV targets one specific type (CD4). research link specify types Tcells effected.

This research also happened petri dish. Good researchers would never claim anything happens lab happen body. authors dont make claim.

**AND IMPORTANTLY:** conclusions KNOW anything directly contradicted authors study. write ""Thus, questions SARS-CoV-2 infection replication primary cells whether infection induces apoptosis cells still need research, potentially evoking new ideas pathogenic mechanisms therapeutic interventions.""

I'm research professor summer vacation. day. don’t Texas raise hell i’m sure, even like 5% population wiped (obviously that’s stretch get point)  article essentially says nothing. sure fuck do. I'm sure outlier's, lifted people helping them, short amount time much regretted it. I've 3 different people life ended better. Pre-text Edit: downvotes prove point. care science fits narritive. 

You joke, every science denier 100 people use ""because science"" sheild bogus ideas without even understanding science completely misinterpreting studies. 

Like amount people unable understand validity journal articles astounding. N=7 representstive population, especially resesrches introduce bias study selecting participants. ""science"" doesnt make ""good science"".

The average person sucks ""science"" cherry picks things based whatever agenda may be, infinitely worrysome idiot flat earth society t-shirt. Keep buddy best keep scratching scab. president literally power use defense production act order production tests (and PPE, etc).  refuses thinks positive tests make look bad. 

And mess now. never get this, never get this. finally get this. 👋🏼 give fuck outside wearing masks. 

Also, care economy either, think complete shutdown vaccine available? Lol numbers real. earth would need 190k hospital beds 50k infections? Makes slot sense! militarized police departments protests direct outgrowths ""the war terror."" fucking great hey everyone, u/Tychonaut vegan. really want know Get right kind mask. home-made cotton kind best. Get one fits comfortably breath it. buy etsy.  yeah ballparking probably site used.

i'm starting wonder covid around earlier people think less contagious something. even end last year pneumonia usual, like everyone brother got it, still hitting people  dont find lot asian countries list? datas trustworthy?

And u find data number test France? ok Better expecting. live Chicago pretty disappointed see people KY TN acting trip Nashville last week. Yes know, happen seen happening countries.

To seems blindingly obvious take person different place cannot infect others.

But that's whaat did. locked everybody sick seniors. *surprise*! big outbreak many dead.

Remember going on, newly built emergency field hospitals quarantine capability stood empty unused. gets deleted clearly agenda driven using extremely rough estimates guesses paint narrative. Nearly every country planet that's bad outbreak way official numbers yet China gets conspiracy treatment Good luck trying enforce anywhere. People going either corvidiots going assert rights. going call police apethetic? Counties starting lift orders, too. county moving “phase 3,” despite fact past 3 days we’ve 30% increase cases. agree that's bad advice know know now, would exaggeration describe 'demonize' mask wearers: portray wicked threatening. ... yeah doubt it...  am, opening theatres next Friday. Despite way active cases originally started locking down. I’ve hearing reading “scientist say” bullshit entire life. scientists want believed scientists stop lying stop allowing colleagues lie.

Also, Denmark Norway agreed Sweden well closing schools said done way. many studies saying children main driver contagion also stupid bring up. 

A person spreading disease UNWITTINGLY one thing, person spreading disease KNOWINGLY subject self-quarantine especially warned legal implications - stated clearly health system website (which also sure provide get test back) :

# Positive test response covid-19?

Your test response shows covid-19, happens now?

When test response shows ongoing infection covid-19, important stay home infect others

You considered contagious period symptoms, well two symptom-free days, least 7 days. time period should:

* go work school
* follow special hygiene procedures: careful wash hands frequently, use towel cough arm fold handkerchief. 
* Keep touch doctor 
* inform caregivers infected. 

If ongoing infection covid-19, must also protect people environment, according Infection Protection Act. called duty protection. means ill waiting test response:

* must inform household contacts people close contact with, healthcare care staff, including home care covid-19.
* meeting people ones already live with. means, among things, go school work, go shopping store.
* travel bus, train, subway plane 
* [read avoid unnecessarily exposing people risk infected.

If want discuss test response, contact doctor via video call. become worse illness, contact 1177 Care Guide telephone. case death call 112. Idiocracy documentary. Target fought unionization tooth nails years. fooled cynical PR move. grabbing headlines giving workers little don’t organize demand more. won’t. Mark down. fairy dust, make believe planning. easier get no? Except something resembling vaccine, waiting research it?

Also, pharmaceutical expert? make independent judgements what's acceptable not? pulling opinions others written?

I think edited notification started ''others it' pretty typical anti-vaxxer sentiment. L.A. County less half cases half (57%) deaths. OC averaging 200 cases day. I'm sure state whenever unemployment money come going end TON cash. Like federal money almost $8,000 top whatever state going give you. 

It sucks incompetent state. I've got lot friends family laid making money extra $600.

Legitimately trying help called them? I've heard stories website says pending call. call talk someone works out. ignore fact, pride month, gay teens get kicked day families don’t burn social bridges that. I’m glad hear that. It’s probably predictable I’m La Mesa area. spit Mission Trails... whenever drive get groceries everyone large groups wearing masks sidewalk, yards, etc. it’s sad. Glad you’re seeing different tho- people right thing. Florida done new Yorkers fled there, maybe Florida fucked now. Belgiums excess mortallity close reported number Covid-19 deaths. also counted ""suspected"" deaths well reported ones.

Compared say Netherlands, far higher excess mortallity reported Covid-19 deaths. Netherlands extreme iirc didnt count deaths happend care homes.

And Belgium locked hard parts lf Europe really fail see mean here. Judge going throw out. I'd kinda want see T-shirt yeah understand people. complain shutdown pointless big surge. I've literally said family ""That point shutdown muppet!"" Bone apple tea compadray  Denmark weathered epidemic much positive manner

Oh, coronavirus Denmark good now? believe?

Btw live country 300 covid deaths per 9mil population (with new wave predictably gaining strength), course cost hardest socio-economic crisis existence kill much people virus itself, understand I'm really envious Swedish approach. Almost studies focused influenza showed effective difference N95 good surgical masks protecting wearer. Aerosol generating procedures (like intubation mechanical ventilation) different, otherwise N95 necessarily protective despite everyone somehow accepting that. Misunderstood directions conquered Middle Earth motherfucking guy... harder hit areas delayed opening compared rest state impacted. Montgomery county starting next phase tomorrow. Hogan's handled pretty well overall, individual county leadership made harder decisions watched counties open up. Masks mandatory grocery stores. Mask usage outside maybe 50/50 stores I've almost 100%. 


Overall think people pretty good it. people still going country. Complaining harder ever before. played literally couldn’t made obvious comment meant do, yet always take face value. guess shouldn’t surprised Protestors gotta protest. Cotton &amp; Greenway? genetic predisposition non-believers. addressing actual ""death count"". fucked part video modern campaign event 360p chart says non-covid PUI, meaning Persons Investigation, presumably cases yet confirmed. Trumps ego large bravado would make move look weak supporters .  


That would complete negative ""let's make deal"" guy. Pope's dick fit donut? boss said no. One side belief rooted science, other, conspiracy.  Millenials got fucked :\\ don’t know yet, fist studies suggest virus cause damage even without symptoms

 [there plenty studies, maybe could volunteer  Replace ""exhausted"" ""bored ready move onto next news cycle things coronavirus yesterday's news"". pretty sad. feel attention span anything. many people maybe know 1 person got it, get survive. think over-blown. lungs fill goo. Nah. Humans story detectors people making easy find ironic stories putting harms way. saw. Absolutely. ZERO main coverage this. recently. Early percentage deaths believe even higher.  30/40/50% deaths states early nursing homes.  

Mods deleted posts saying “fake news / conspiracy” subreddit data looked. 

Fauci co. Pushed social distancing anyone die thing extreme nothing else instead focusing practical things like avoiding elderly isolating since obviously they’ll die like 1000x?+++ often (mods don’t delete post it’s really 10000x...).  wearing mask since fauci deliberately withheld information. Amazon Go's already established.  god damn u made piss pants wife’s, too, she’s nurse. vitamin deficient. forget ""Surprise Gynecology,"" ""Surprise Funeral Care!"" 😆 almost cover increase everything else! Also encourage smaller property managers go business landlord bank! Yay! ever rural AZ? It’s much different. Thanks, makes feel lot better. outpatient facility part hospital network area, site main hospital campus. would say definitely trustworthy. 

I'm going upper GI endoscopy evaluate symptoms acid reflux/GERD. laparoscopy option lol First all, dont think Trump holding rallies; time, people masses protesting (mainly media told protested lockdowns murdering grandma, different?)

And second, still doesnt give people right burn whatever building feel like tell us comment would got downvoted banned month ago. live California let's honest help much LARGE number workforce lives far work . 


I grew 60 miles away LA well known lots people make commute LA expensive , move somewhere little cheaper drive back forth LA .  southern California though specifically . 


 
Also LA county massive Riverside county hell time right right next door means nothing effectively.  work, people like feel suffocated something. I'd rather mild annoyance death permanent lung damage, thank much. I'm tukee, want raise rent $120/mo 1290. even 900 sq ft lot us even get unemployment things bleak. wanted see ignorant sounds. don’t think it’s reopening per se. It’s fact people thought reopening meant cdc guidelines mask wearing longer required. Mask use way PA since went green. wish people Wisconsin would get board this. I’m literally person floor work wears mask. wear one public, count one hand many others well. people look like two heads. It’s infuriating. NY numbers gone up, virus sill region though. Yesterday 582 cases. number dropping steadily despite protests. 

Your hypothesis backed data. Hope helps. Knew recognised guy somewhere, sheriff one seasons 60 days  He’s gonna kill many voters time election comes up. tell average age survivors experience chronic fatigue? Nah want that. Trump gets dies, becomes Martyr... would worst outcome  :( I'm crying rn Kind fucked thing say even think he's bad person. Thank much! found Reddit thread Google (even though use reddit every day) hopefully help others well.

Thanks again!   well least future forecast getting it. stop people ignoring near AC region. Pretty depressing see. listen downvotes. sub using NYC masks work mandated cases dropping. I've seen shit. People constantly touching faces. Seen people grab door handle pull mask. doctors would remiss already given blood products disease survivors COVID prophylaxis.  common cold immunity lasts year.

That misleading statement best. ""common cold"" caused 200 different viruses. Additionally versions caused coronaviruses result 12+ month immunity people.

[First many studies come asymptotic patients long term effects You’ve misunderstood data- apples oranges. cited rate based deaths per estimated total cases (estimated unconfirmed confirmed). JHA uses confirmed cases denominator clear fact. San Fernando Valley.

I live AZ particular area live high density veterans “patriots” firearms, IBAs, sunscreen, mosquito repellants, bear sprays (better pepper spray rest isn’t common.) 

The thing may know metal mining industry economic powerhouse AZ. area it’s everything. Take one several medium large mines AZ would substantial economically.

With it’s common large portion AZ population also wear steel toed boots, hi vis vests, eye protection, hearing protection, jeans (nothing else allowed), hand protection, seatbelts, brainer PPE day work.

Even several sites visit employees refuse wear mask. explanation refusal anything “I rights” “but president doesn’t.” company (one largest state) responded it’s expectation employment added PPE policy flexibility. follow risk termination. give resistance, mean anything.

You're right, never mentioned resistance. We're talking long term effects. know listed long term effect SARS is? Osteoporosis. Probably coronaviruses affect elderly far far far young.  covid prank bro...... /s also innate immune system, better worse. many parts immune system need much previous training different people.

Here's what'll happen:

Trump: ""I twenty million people rally""

Fox News camera remains extreme closeup.
Other news outlets uncritically print quote.

Is really trolling he's going lie anyway declare success based fake number? I've lived alone last 5 years, turning 30 summer. laid mess AZ so.. easy finding new job lease (they wanted increase $1170/mo $1290/mo) so, I'm renting storage unit moving back home foreseeable future. 

I feel you, best luck! Nah, he's r/Masks4All day! least Ohio people getting extra $600 per week

That nation wide. Part CARES act anyone qualified state level receive *any amount* unemployment would get additional $600/week feds. understanding also non-taxable income.  Yeah know now. Beaches pretty safe turns out. Wear mask. Oh sunscreen. Thanks? actually stuff it. problem is, made wild guess dosage, turned way much. Lt.Gov. add, working vaccine prototype MERS camels, tested well works well (it camels, spread disease/are vector Middle East).

What user writes here: ""If actually coming virus confer longterm immunity coronavirus, prepping immune system going virtually useless. best people might immune weeks months, they're suddenly immune catch like otherwise would've albeit much shorter timeline."" 

is also completely wrong, many modern vaccines work like getting infection - could provide better worse immunity, longer shorter immunity infection. probably thinks old style vaccinations attenuated virus. That's type vaccination really direclty compare immune reaction actual infection target virus.

""This also polio vaccine requires multiple vaccinations across long time period, one two vaccinations polio still get it.""

This depends also vaccine, still get it, typically get much milder.

For common colds, even coronaviruses, beside mentioned, also mutate pretty quickly, many many different strains.

For SARS-2 far, spike protein mutate significantely seems unlikely soon. might get mutated pressure vaccination, we'll see. scientists think that's likely. give credit also good interviewer unique way. 



He gets people put guards asks weird ass questions can't prepared PR responses &amp; actually get different perspective guest.

In NY protests happening every single day since start June, tens thousands people streets, statistically significant uptick cases, hospitalizations, deaths.  Arizona checking in......... Pretty bold claim considering labs/testing sites around country closed days riots likely backlogged. We’re great. live here? deaths (which matters) remained steady since early april.

""I'm looking two laws hand [and] going one that's 200 years old rather two days old."" told totally compatible?

I continue amazed seemingly intelligent people cannot grasp basic fact right absolute. even freedoms afforded protection Bill Rights. Hundreds years case law unequivocally note exceptions liberties rights. 

My freedom exercise faith, protected Free Exercise clause First Amendment, allow engage illegal activity protection faith amendment. freedom speech protect right threaten others. Americans stupid. visited Japan October lot ppl wore masks daily anyway. big babies shit. hell anything? Cases already rise OK likely continue way Saturday tens thousands maniacs gather support dear leader...im honestly sure point you’re trying make I'm sure China butt hurt. hoax, President people screened?  thank proving point twisting words. get cookie! mean everyone Oklahoma rally take Covid-19 test approved attend? ""President Danger American Lives"" clearly idea talking about. Log off.  I've gotten ad credits mailed me, I'm pretty sure typical ""hey, advertised while, here's credit"" usually post.

Stealing this. likely fine... enforces stance. seen plenty pictures California people masks on. ""In tough times, tough decisions made,"" said. ""I'm looking two laws hand [and] going one that's 200 years old rather two days old.""

I sure understand logic. older law is, higher precedence? going start dunking alleged witches water? Lol union city. Maybe mixed rollout getting emails massage places restaurants opening back 22nd. explain anything someone sanctimonious. used live Flagstaff loved it, also refused go farther South Sedona. people dealing Flag? folks probably offended women breastfeeding public. test isn’t 100% accurate. Doubtful it’s even 80% accurate. creator specifically said reason use test contagious diseases yet went ahead use anyway. Think critically like 30 seconds this, hard come answer happens. still mask even bandana homie? ya been? Good know, looks like part Texas getting swamped. thinking 2 ways this. 1) let infections happen make herculean efforts get everybody treated. End result region gained immunity infection recovery (the Sweden model). 2) reduce infections slow burn vaccine comes, barring that, spread case load time hospitals take care people business usual scenario. know take-out discussed lot sub (and deemed safe), ordering food that's really heated (like sushi, cold sandwiches, salads, etc)?

Reddit: downvote! Can’t find map one Governor Wolf (PA) slinging around shows OR’s cases increasing greater rate CA.

Maybe it’s this. lot older people selfish ways. first Cuomo says stores aren’t allowed let people without masks yet Walmart seems care potential fines health risks patrons want sale. loves Walmart actually followed Cuomo says they’d turn away really wanted go he’d wear mask. thing worries happens cough around wrong person. may get assaulted. yes wearing mask even don’t want isn’t really it’s protect others around us greatly reduces catching cough sneeze happen spit talk. government isn’t helping news. Maybe news get permission families meme bet hospital ventilator really sick film him/her. may open people’s eyes, non mask wearers won’t care. Don’t think they’ll catch won’t open eyes someone close catches passes away. won’t even then.  Ultimately yes matter. let's world know China truly doesnt give single fuck anyone outside borders give accurate info happens inside border. people already knew bring light others didnt know China acts. You’re probably right... wouldn’t able drive already time work stayed home could still fun. also plane ticket paid advance (by fam) probably pressure/guilt coming. it’s kinda working :/ 

I’m worried too. hundreds thousands dead crashed economy hundreds thousands dead semi functioning economy.

But binary like this. South Korea never went full lockdown. in-between solution fully-opened fully-closed. I'm sure elected leaders understand either or. Really?? would think people basic sewing skills than...whatever skills would take make moldable plastic face shield. I'm Cali I've using full-face respirator P100s since began Costco, Target, etc. look like idiot really care. Still filters (though, 30 minutes use per week...). use clog get difficult breathe through. particulate filter need wear out. Vegans gotta remind people veganhood times else explode, common side effect using ones canines tear apart flesh.

Really vegan glad steak eating contagious, grow exponentially.

But math also hard you’re protein deficient. much older problem Covid-19. friend mine construction particularly belligerent coworker insisted hoax took mask every opportunity. changed tune wife got it, stand-up enough apologize rest team it. Exactly, 'it run adjacent track, one I'm walking on'. SF runners required wear mask Lmao reddit would downvoted Actually, humans designed deal invisible abstract threats. That's pretty much separates us animal kingdom. see point, though. think people weighing risks virus poses need social contact quality life equation ends net positive many. Life short dangerous. Harsh truth: think wearing mask makes look weak, never looked tough begin with. true! Good point first comparison could think Denmark, Finland Norway suffering mental crisis? 

I think mean Swedes, due government gaslighting half year. course mention HIV, research paper editorial piece.

What think HIV does? infects replicates inside T4 cells destroying process right? research shows SARS-COV-2 virus infects T4 cell replicate cell. kills it. effect immune system therefore similar case didnt notice, severely suppressed immune system already recognised 'recovered' patients add prevalence called asymptomatic people virus exhibiting flu like covid-19 symptoms one wants ask, exactly virus them? already mild version flu like symptoms months earlier realizing it? compare numbers rest world, neighboring countries similar culture socio-economics, obviously done much better job?

The countries different look amount international travel early months can't protect seniors without containment societal level, unless willing isolate staff even need access hospitals. idea possible protect vulnerable old unrealistic.

And basing opinion data?

Let ask - possible protect hospital patients exposure outside airborne infections without shutting country?

How respect rights Swedes choose path, rest world know rest Nordics done better. Far better.

Well Japan better all. maybe follow Japan's lead? Man 8ts crazy, southern cal see us boomers less youngsters wearing them. U2 - miss around, hehe! Yes no. California BIG, 10 million people Texas 18 million Florida. really class population-wise. haven’t watched entire briefings, Twitter presence basically “job done!” No. New Zealand right. cure coronavirus country can't close forever. took measures root domestically check people coming country keep check. fact 3 cases know big victory them. magic eliminate controlling it. Well done New Zealand. Ocoee resident here, wondering myself. think reason Orlando's local government, addition theme parks, much faster act DeSantis came shutting everything. problem seems we're also much faster act reopening everything. wife's nurse said plans open field hospital NRG back on. also coworker test positive office got tested yesterday. Even health care workers getting sick. works NY highly concentrated public transit would effect  trying say don’t point, didn’t get report asymptotic spread rare?

One affiliate made statement almost immediately clarified asymptomatic presymptomatic transmission still occurs.

The majority studies indicate transmission frequently occurs symptoms. Whether become symptomatic later think still undetermined. total clickbait. article like five paragraphs basically says may second wave, wear masks buy hand sanitizer. maybe therapist work, paid employers.

What protections confidentiality would have? Would able get angry would hide anger employers? (Anger normal part grieving process btw.) veg picked exploited immigrants monster. That’s basically politician is. Good luck human race climate change choice. People hunker isolate see friends/family/neighbors/colleagues dying. 

You either shut things orderly PC, pandemic randomly shuts components uses resources crashes. saved games backups available. Ivermectin combination antibiotic doxycycline. I'm sorry agree overall cause (uh defunding police departments though, wtf...as though Oakland enough crime-ridden shithole), pandemic fucking stupid. kill 10000x black people (and everyone else) ever died police violence. Yes needs addressed we're middle national emergency people joining bored youth looking party excuse go out, let's face it. it'll get ball park, it'll know sure. it'll interesting see things shake places perhaps getting 2x covid others place getting 3x pnuemonia something (numbers completely made up), states sent people back nursing homes positive mild other's didn't. 

hopefully someone math epidemiology backgrounds give best practices cities follow perhaps based size, demographics, something know next time normal day staffed lower crowd levels. halloween event large worth putting lower attendance to. idea intensive difficult medical science is.

Its opinion disagreeing with. opinion Pulitzer prize winning Dr, professor medicine Harvard, ex FDA commissioner, vice chair microbiology U Penn.

You're fucking kid Reddit. I'm saying easy, I'm saying guarantee, I'm saying wholly uninformed causing unnecessarily pessimistic future. Listen Kennedy's ""why moon"" speech get perspective. realize celebrities people following taking pictures pretty much non stop right? happened Denver Waffle House like 2-3 weeks ago India huge, disastrous problems covid right now. better winter summer. 

Australia NZ cases summer now, winter. 

All states listed getting hit hard COVID RIGHT NOW. world talking study finds temperature, latitude associated COVID-19 spread They’re still getting credit hours remotely. God fucking forbid. government response area literally add masks situation nothing else, else supposed interpret this? also, whataboutism? really? Words meanings. Irreparable lung damage? form lung damage? 7 day averaged death count falling last 2 months, though. That's good news.

The 7 day average peaked April 21st 2214 deaths. May 21st 1296. Two weeks ago June 4th 979 yesterday 687. Nobody said got infected outside protest really clear goal allow disease spread controlled rate society. Whether that's produce herd immunity patients Giesecke family's clinics reason hard say sure. 

It also looks like ""cull weak animals"" testing severe symptoms things charitable Sweden, Denmark able ramp capacity. HOWEVER Denmark ramp capacity quickly HOW! seen graph? super heartwarming shows done country like Denmark puts mind something! 

I'm Danish know :) ad advantage big bio tech companies, helped test capacity.

What strange Sweden seem fine meagre test capacity. much amp up, even asked us could tests them.

The test place Copenhagen like 10 km Sweden. could drive tests fast. excess capacity. Plus could get help setting stuff.

To seem really care tests. Well theory doesn’t work given NY CA. Regardless, point seems like even Fox News saying masks help. honestly stubborn wear one store juncture. Smart. whoosh...it ALSO number include antibody tests. right side map. [The statement put says ""At least fall, bring undergraduates back campus"" adds
that ""don't yet know"" many undergrads come back.


So allowing students back campus, know many yet. tough sort fact fiction this. ""3 people"" figure pass sniff test. narrowed people self-reported getting protest. test centers asking people got it. contact tracers saying certainty.


 hard know lot new cases recent California wave originated. Human systems complex. count somebody went restaurant protest confirmed, ""got protest."" can't sure get restaurant. 



That's would make sense look cities hosted major protest two three-week mark. even clear picture confirm cases everybody getting tested. lot false negatives.




Here's local source little bit less biased taught ok ignore information makes feel bad. Haha sorry—it felt like writing different sub, figured asked, spreading word effectively wear masks exercising going important moving forward pandemic—especially states start mandating mask use. Well guess we'll great test case entire US cities start requiring masks locking down. think people realize ICU beds used huge range reasons generally empty. like empty 100 ICU beds COVID patients suddenly filled them. problem surgeries uptick COVID patients. fill margin pretty quickly slowing elective surgeries. That's places northeast cleared ICU bed usage also doubled capacity never particularly close running space. 

Even article dispute numbers added capacity. anyone bother actually read article?  Yeah, would funny depressing.   want every one fuckers walk around pants-less prove point. Let dangle, wouldn’t want infringe anyone’s rights. Lol, generally aware before, making conscious choice item actually saving full amount still surprising. Watch pennies dollars take care suppose.  PA too. many investors happily scoop cheap property sit years economy stabilizes. Dream scenario real estate investors. lot residents transplants. kind like America's America. People usually tell grew x state get know someone, like lot Americans would say family x country. want prove party credible, provide something credible, casually say 'some report says' without providing source? least show us report. Kind of? Like, airports government buildings much higher security, there's Islamophobia U.S. keeps invading Middle East, see huge changes. It’s they’re processing information.

People need stop looking daily increases, 1-3 day increases look general trend week/month. BS, you’re using huge logical fallacies argument whataboutism? unproductive. Try better friend. don’t need prove anything. need start fights false pretenses like people thinking masks magic bullet. 👀🍑 pro-mask argument means would certainly around 8 months. Thanks I’m sure. lowered expectations long time ago. really looking forward day Busch gardens riding iron gwazi. That’s table us even open.

All really need beach umbrella, book cold beer. Sit watch surf, sea birds dolphins. fact kinda hope that’s afterlife be. think that's high number, seriously. feel like I'm 1 wearing mask sometimes. even wear em, half covering mouths. 

City's gonna burn. IANACL (I Constitutional Lawyer), I'm pretty sure authority enforce travel restrictions states would fall ""interstate commerce"", federal government protective clause Constitution. Meaning, states can't close borders one another without permission federal government, there's way current federal government allows that. Sure, real risk transmission comes close contact and/or breathing area *for long period time, usually least 10 minutes*. keeping distance hanging place hour much lower risk. Contrast workers 4-8 hours time work space, often without physical distancing. PA MD: kicking viral ass discussing SARS-COV-2 infects kills T4 cells. 

Yes. doesnt kill stage 2 probably Immunodeficiency syndrome time later on. 

That's bullshit. body beats clean, body rebuild Cells. COVID chill body forever like HIV. hospitalized treatment COVID-19 recent weeks Dallas County, two three people younger 65, nearly half chronic, underlying health conditions. nowhere mention *her* deciding anything. Multiple people called OP choosing wife - mutual choice could clarified that. Yeah OK.. also keep told ""the red line really far away 300+ new cases day Dallas County normal fine mostly prisoners old people.""


I hate right now. Bill Burr gave hard time made funny Think funny comedians that. Like admit know medical stuff. Yet one ones thinks blown proportion anything worry about. still fuck China hey overlord says so. PM filter source, por favor? Millions losing jobs complete industries destroyed unprecedented government borrowing.

Yes brutal Oh yeah baby! love working @ Target! said, disdain people white collar jobs; statement would sounded odd. 

As far relation education population; exists, really lead conclusion commentor pushing 

If look #1 Ann Arbor, #4 Durham, #6 Madison. known world class universities. far states; Cali, Texas, Florida prominent map disdain leadership education level. realize NY cooled off, state still pumping 500-1000 confirmed new cases every day, vast majority NYC area. 

That's small number, small may seem compared 10K per day peak.

I would assume every person walk past NYC it, there's good chance do. kids. Home schooling next year. Greedy fucks thats get. much difference Jackson county, didn't. It’s fantasy think economy going revert back small local businesses. corporate model took cede territory many workers don’t option go eat job smaller business. 

There way fast food restaurant workers fast food store managers regional managers corporate employees CEOs board members. Way more. That’s reason expect more. takes making folks aware class power organized behind it. strains change alter neutralizing property. protests started Memorial Day weekend Fair - many people wear masks required to.

You already subsidizing failure states tax dollars, get worse states increase spending support large homeless/housing insecure populations. 

I'd also point today's high credit score tenants tomorrows ""laid can't afford pay rent"" tenants. Vicious cycle lower rents unsustainable levels, sell house first investor willing pay cash clear note. 

That said, can't argue renting military - many people wont due bad reputation military tenants, constant moving/lease breaks, good thanks. Blame priests said virus barrier dictate God's actions. One worship God anymore definitely call gather one spot pandemic. I'm sure there's significant number people thinking ""well care safety, protecting you?""

I'm here. hardly see masks anymore. Working retail means see lot faces. quarantine restrictions lifted state I'd say best 40% customers store would wear masks. wondering since quarantine started governor made masks requirement staff businesses customers. goes ""Ohioans protecting Ohioans."" Well anyway, right Mike?

Last weekend way door got coughed guy holding mask hand. purpose idgaf even without coronavirus. cover fucking mouth. got shitty asked problem said ""I fucking mask asshole"" held hand show me. Well ask use mask asked cover mouth. great let know mask guess still pretty useful hand. 🙄

So I'm wondering wear mask protect people. decided I'm done cloth masks I'm public. I'm going exclusively use N95s I'm energy care people show contempt towards others.

Maybe I'm bad person I'll healthy bad person help it. fancy way say ""dumb"" Lol really think renters much financial freedom? issue isn’t rich people wanting nice apartments, obvious enough shouldn’t explain Annoying?

In US 19.6 Million people unemployed. 3 Trillion USD spent (and totally spent, that's gone need need more). 30% rent mortgage payments made. 

Yeah. that's inconvenient.

I'm glad think worth it. admit others might disagree. well one job 28 hours available people need work 40 least, really absurd consider getting another job. ""But sounds hard inconvenient!"" whines american exceptionalism. really. referenced “the truth”. That’s pretty broad. 

Public health involves communication, science. protests confirm point. could stay shut Beijing hundred cases. clearly put people economy. 

3% Wuhan infected line data there. Stop spreading nonsense unless back ""they lots beds"". Pretty sure - you. 

First, private events people may following mask rules mean health order exist. right silly logic. 

Second, don’t need wear mask inside restaurant seated (think would someone eat drink?). 

Third, honestly idea rules inside gym. Maybe aren’t required inside gym. staying far far far away gym find out. find masks mandatory gym report county health authority feel strongly.

The county health order says wear mask outside can’t social distance wear mask inside unless fall specific exemption (i.e. car, home, seated restaurant, child daycare, certain age, etc). welcome look exemptions post like.  However, normal everyday shopping experience, one supposed wear mask county health order. plus, like fuck them- wearing mask dope makes look like ninja! post defended anything anyone whatsoever? Ah yeah avoided bars restaurants far cant speak that. Guess good reason. yes!! family even yet know what's coming lmfao. lost minds? go Christian school? never heard anything remotely like growing up. feel like would common actually trait virus. now, seems like outlier, learn things everyday idk issue really misunderstood, want explain little bit Executive Order, meant, put place.

First, really important remember nursing homes state run - private corporations paid LOT money take care residents. lots laws regulations need comply maintain license, including able manage properly react infectious disease may afflict facility.

Just like one residents got flu, facility able separate positive negative residents monitor care effectively treat without transmitting virus residents. facilities able manage COVID-19.

However actually happened, facilities started sending residents mild symptoms hospitals refusing readmit found perfectly stable need hospitalized. allowed. Facilities get paid hundreds thousands (often millions) dollars per year turf residents hospitals need hospitalized.

Elderly people often really poorly hospital settings. detrimental wellbeing move unfamiliar environment, ""failure thrive"" common cause death among elderly undergo prolonged hospitalization. important remain place feel comfortable wherever possible.

So, Cuomo issued Executive Order stating nursing homes readmit residents, even positive, long stable health and, importantly, *the facility able care according regulations implemented.*

A facility well within rights transfer resident different facility contact NYS department health say need help, can't take care resident (because enough staff example). Cuomo actively encouraging this, said State either move residents hotels take care, appoint receiver take running facility completely.

Cuomo also announced joint investigation Department Health Attorney General actively investigate every single nursing home NY revoke license compliance. know many Erie County nursing homes already surprise inspections.

However, also worth noting significant number NY nursing homes - including highest death rates - [zero following DOH inspections, even multiple inspections. So, matter facility did, even 100% compliance laws regulations recommendations, virtually impossible keep virus out. So, Cuomo's Executive Order heinous New York Post loves make be, nursing homes inevitable breeding grounds virus.

Edit: Also, [research racial make nursing home biggest factor terms transmission, facility’s history quality care, Nursing Home Compare ratings, non-profit for-profit ownership structure, proportion Medicaid residents bearing likelihood COVID-19 infections.

Edit 2: Also worth noting [New York's coronavirus death rate nursing home residents mimicks death rates found Italy, Spain, France, Germany likely little impact Cuomo's Executive Order. countries coronavirus rates far comparable New York Florida. HAHAHAHA, followed link [report](http://www.rightsrisks.org/banner/india-medias-crackdown-during-covid-19-lockdown-2/) get Arnab Goswami (FIR), Maharashtra 

No, get FIR Covid-19, even one data point undermines this. 

I going bother go look others. report waste prepared agenda paint reporters victims whereas see journalists print roaming around containment zones gujarat/telangna/delhi reporting bad situation without FIRs/arrests anything else. absurd insulting. People work one job. I'm talking Wuhan only. mad? R u mad? SARS antibodies detected people upwards 12 years. LOL love dramatic af people act like legit lockdown here. Every state inevitably going go sort wave, states avoided low numbers start, quick reopenings, mitigation efforts place, basically threw back March/April.  study that, honestly? airborne droplet, also contact?

unless GI tract kills it...? Reddit needs stop daydreaming things work start thinking practically. they? find hard believe, whole NY state like 30k beds. join? central floridian, wear mask religiously, socially distance. North Park folks walks sidewalks masks, lots people bars/restaurants wearing 'em. also lots Arizona tourists beach communities, bodes real well considering terribly Arizona doing. Conclusion


Both seasonal influenza vaccine PPV23 prevent substantial burden targeted disease mortality among older adults adults at-risk. Despite potential collateral reduction influenza pneumococcal circulation due contact reducing interventions, countries COVID-19 pandemic coincides season high risk pneumococcal and/or influenza disease, vaccination high coverage added benefits: minimising number pneumococcal influenza hospital admission reduces resources needed care non-COVID-19 patients minimises risk health-care acquired COVID-19 infection. influenza, similarity symptoms COVID-19 cases also suggests vaccination increase specificity syndromic COVID-19 surveillance interventions.

The magnitude COVID-19 morbidity mortality prevented influenza vaccine PPV23 probably relatively small, although present cannot exclude possibility either preventing considerable amount COVID-19 related mortality (Table 1). uncertainty highlights importance detailed monitoring additional studies possible, high low income settings. proportion vaccine preventable COVID-19 morbidity mortality could assessed, example, post mortem examinations test-negative case-control studies [45].

In summary, already routine use high uptake among older adults and/or adults at-risk, seasonal influenza PPV23 potential reduce burden targeted diseases also prevent proportion COVID-19 morbidity mortality, delivered minimising risk SARS-CoV-2 transmission. However, countries without routine use, currently little evidence encourage implementation either seasonal influenza vaccine PPV23 programmes older adults solely purpose reducing COVID-19 mortality.  know, even know. I've paying fairly close attention. One day seemed like virus starting get control, next day Trump said dems making political. Although never saw said make political. moment forward political, wears masks doesn't. Sky News.. scraping daily barrel anything tentatively link C-19. worry, I'll happily one first line get it. I'll let know negative reactions. 

I'm curious I've seen basically exactly worded post many people. Everyone say antivaxers trust new vaccine. I'm saying bot, feel like campaign misinformation spreading distrust vaccines developed. like scientist slapping together covid bunch random chemicals hoping die it. I've seen new covid vaccine based lot work SARS vaccine (also coronavirus) got mothballed longer needed. produced fast. going 444 467 really considered spike? Also. list much New York decreased prior day listed increases every value? wish casinos OK bit concerned health instead rushing get back full open capacity again. safety protocols mandatory. way steadily rising case numbers explained away backlogs. look graph, even seem like much spike, part normal increase (though one day part may due backlog; there's reason backlog cases added rolling averages). 

Increased testing plays role, point, transmission rate one, cases start go down. Hospitalizations rising deaths sure follow (except better treatment know effect fatality rates). Ahhh YouTube video. perfect place conduct experiments. great data. 100% repeatable great peer review. Definitely great sample size might add yeah hear that. really want visit want fork 50 bucks PLUS 10 parking see loony-bin ark. think jesus would approve kind price gouging. God sick sense humor. poor childhood nothing oldest kid got PhD year ago get it.

Like said, it’s sacrifice. Everyone’s life affected sort shitty way. they’re still getting MIT education, millions students across country exact boat preschool post grad, end students still get degree says MIT it. explain relics left behind Sumerians? That's litteraly 6000 years ago present day Iraq.

Like, think archeological sites came from? taught us second guess every official statement pandemic wonder ulterior motive was. that's way worse long run. Quack, recommend learn Apple Google's system works. Nobody personally tracked. That's beauty it. pandemic over, data (which inherently says nothing single person) deleted. BTW, opt always opt out. end walking right next strangers sometimes. others walking around neighborhood. lot trails area. I've self quarantined things let up. Can't wait backwards state, like anywhere else better TBH. drives crazy. still go inside bars restaurants. stores still closed. New York City still much shut much country. cases, deaths, hospitalizations continue go even testing increases. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* Ah drat, newer article too. TBH kept PCR accuracy, somewhat assumed there'd improvements somehow. think assumed Iceland using testing border, seemed generally make decent decisions figured let something big chance fail through. figured would improvements PCR Iceland working better, accurate tests, actually bit silly since problem low accuracy probably viral loads. checked recent research. 

Even though bad news, thank link. Well, I'm even worried Iceland Denmark. 

Maybe enough public pressure get DK reverse decision goes effect. There's lot outcry circles, anyway. Ha ha ha. Yeah, live Quebec in-laws Texas. two places worlds part. Dirty Myrtle baby  certain majors sure things successful career. Millions people figured go college, incur large amounts debt, land good job allows pay make large amounts money live comfortably. Pro tip, first step working target feeling sorry yourself. need specific wording, clear guy talking implying virus high kappa-value contained keeping population infected certain threshold. SARS-CoV-2 high kappa value. think we'll see containment superior mitigation, regards public health economy alike. we'll see. far, Nordics ahead. race competition. really wish best us all. hope adjust changing evidence. completely reconsider relationship industrial meat complex. given 99% meat consumed factory farmed, maybe simplify relationship meat. 
No? would helped people say start masks work.

Fauci, subs wank pot, went lack needs masks, suddenly uturns convenient. *knew* masks worked lied.

In sort environment, become difficult many people trust scientific advisors.

edit: grammar Damn that's heartbreaking. Would interested know Covid status parents South Floridian preggo here. haven’t seen family months they’d rather go mall restaurants throw game nights friends neighbors (large group gatherings). People seriously denial virus I’m fully expecting deal consequences. It’s sad truth. like ""science attempt best understanding moment"". contra costa spike think So. one place need mask most, one thing spreads fastest, put fingers ears. government disaster needs wake-up call students finished college, jobs cant find appartment landlord right mind would rent something right now? levers come significant cost future generations?  Affordable Care Act? Sadly accurate. Care share filter source? Probably not, exactly find thread dictionary well it’s antibodies they’re getting mild case contracting slightly less damage negligible damage first time caught extremely mild case.

I mean, I’d much rather get sniffles fifteen times acute respiratory distress syndrome twice. Thank corrected information. never understand people downvote asking questions. SNF's, ALF's - although, ALF's also hit super had, particularly adult care homes developmentally disabled. one best descriptions thread. Yeah so? lived Denmark several years coming back US 2018. know exact Canadian measures US, hardware stores, many types stores stayed open. People going bored-shopping home improvement projects. Many stores strictly enforce customer limits inside. people exercising, walking dogs, hiking, traveling parks despite closed parking lots. many European countries police enforcement lockdown, needed actual reason often paper out, nothing grocery stores pharmacies open, people better staying inside home following lockdown (of course social safety net helped lot). enough people died yet apparently liberal, leftist. School open, person, masks required.

Meanwhile Governor’s Mansion still closed tours. Exactly, I'm sick fear mongering people hanging OUTSIDE risks getting infected significantly lower. live 2 blocks away St. Mark's people gathering outside bars month already (for record partaken these). even PLUS protests going on, infection rates dropping every single day. mean covid related death? one news make difference, sense make possible retrieve information far unthinkable coronavirus also heavily affected Turin Piedmont. RAR fearsome SARS-CoV-2, still circulation, found precision 15/40 samples collected December 2019 February 2020 various Italian cities. particular: Turin, December 18th. Samples water. precisely: waste water Turin metropolitan area. this, attention, face Chinese communication 9 January 2020.

Excuse translation, **there evidence -- based waste water (a really good way find virus) -- coronavirus widely circulating Turin, Italy December 2019.** People probably dying ""pneumonia"" time.

Shame China transparent Wuhan situation October. I'm Access health care thing. Fuck... gotta move downtown... know bad would without heat? know heat could helping, see statement time dumb. one brain ever said heat would kill would over, could well lowering much worse curve across US, way know n ah OK, gotcha. though except peeps like Falci Birx, pretty much America pandemic rookies. (which we're hanging Falci Birx's every word) strategically dumbing us years now. Cuts public education forth. less people learn successfully propaganda becomes due lack training critical thinking. less intelligent population, easier assert control authority. free thinking things questioned allowed happen. want that. /r/masks4all might help KCMO's site include suburbs includes testing numbers. crossed 5% threshold past two weeks worst two weeks we've had. direct result poor strategy. use herd immunity requires constant spread country neighbors countries EU opt suppression / Test, Trace, Isolate going end pariah region. Simple, really. ""wounds"" Swedes entirely self-inflicted Swedish authorities willfully pursued strategy contrary international, European Nordic consensus. joke format used lot, still pretty good Anyone IQ 80 would understand bullshit. Oh wait.. Fast food eaten record levels past months.

Beginning, employees wear mask gloves. dont wear n95 masks.

Employees constantly shout communicate others making food packing it, spraying viral droplets packaging food itself.

Viral droplets spread course normal converations, yes going food 

Corona live 24 hours longer think read. also believe primariy noravirus transmitted.

So, 5 minutes, customer washes hands opens packaging exposing pathogens eating droplets employee burger, furthering exposure pathogens, enough make sick.

This logical according science.

Haven't entire countries like Canada US, populations exposed virus much logically think? Hong Kong Tokyo Beijing don’t seem problems wearing masks street. shame, floridaman seems caring conscientious... odds favor pandemic start. Las Vegas take notice... sad rise could've prevented... apple.news may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

There record numbers cases Alabama, Texas, Arizona, Florida, California, Carolinas, places world like India, summer now. Meanwhile, southern hemisphere countries like Australia New Zealand great start winter. don’t agree last statement. can’t see lies distortions government. Instead see, like articles said crisis before, government hiding behind agency. Instead lying distorting they’ve silent. good thing haven’t made politics hasn’t opposition recently. It’s generally Denmark. 

The PM generally says “eeeeh .......FHM.......eeeeh”. hope change government next election, SD. Anti-science isnt problem. 

Fear mongering is. reported deaths 1, make excess deaths less one? best fusion yeah bullshit, dont want employees talking would almost impossible show liability. could possibly prove contracted virus there, versus somewhere else? ....Larry... Death counter go *brrrrrrrrrrrrrr* archive [http://archive.is/zIwUJ](http://archive.is/zIwUJ) correct future: Thank you, trouble finding appropriate word. month least account transmission, incubation, repeats get doubling time.  guess reverse opening would happen hospitals really capacity Covid patients. thank god got photo op for... ***looks giant check***... $1,000? Oh well might well give get deliberately infect /s That's know cost everything, value nothing. feel Ontario, isolate elderly living retirement homes soon enough. warnings, ever since SARS, staffing shift rotation limited reduce infectious exposure, PPE staff, better routine monitoring infection among residents place separate symptomatic patients quickly. None procedures followed cost bit more. For-profit nursing homes many deaths non-profit facilities, investigated health violations patient neglect. Even though regulations plans place, little enforcement, led loss many lives. rebels feeling mask makes less man, could wear bandanna like real cowboy. Record decrease new unemployment claims!

I agree education needs reform. fact, companies luxury requiring college degree positions don’t need it. Ironically enough, government subsidized loans increased demand college education enabled slush fund schools. allowed school expenditures increase without scrutiny leading increase tuition.

I’d argue hard reset system. Forgive student loans now, cancel future gubment loan guarantees. reduced funding force schools offer affordable degrees like past. 70s 80s people could work part time pay way school. days over.

Also reduced supply college graduates force employers reasonable education demands.

Of course, Reddit downvote arguing need ducation. suspect people taking less seriously March we've discovered Covid less serious feared March. Thankfully.

I vividly recall talk 5% IFRs, etc. we've found twice deadly flu-with-vaccine, average victim age that's higher national life expectancy - still concern, people adjusting accordingly.

There also talk exponential spread. Sweden showed that's case - Covid death toll higher neighbors, all-cause mortality lowest many years.

Very much “the stupid hurts” moment me. Ventura County hasn’t bad... yet. videos I’ve seen online packed bars Tempe/Scottsdale, it’s surprise we’re severe spike. 55% Americans cold hearted simply care. I'm disgusted many people talk read comments different post throughout social media  Go strike havent seen much Michigan, good news (trending down) good (cases going up)?  least I'd tan I'd get bang buck Uganda. Fauci's decision downplay importance masks lying major cause mistrust. Makes sense, counties require face coverings going need money get. sure questions source study, but, kids really might less contagious. [source](http://www.rfi.fr/en/france/20200604-french-covid-19-study-finds-children-far-less-contagious-than-adults) 

It’s still risk, every time I’ve seen articles like this, line drawn high school. saying relax totally might reasonable send kids daycare state that’s genuinely got things control, etc. Tough call. idea like getting people wear masks early days sars epidemic. propaganda get wear mask escalating 😂😂😂 data... overwhelming majority young people aren’t ending hospital. people ignore actual data keep pushing fear?

Where live... 1% people 20-29 end hospital. 0.2% end ICU. 0.1% dead (1 death total age range) 

We lump everyone 60 one here. province 6,377 cases people 60. 2.38% hospital. 0.48% ICU. 0.078% dead. low percents always hugely lean towards higher end age range people 2-3+ underlying health conditions.

Over 60? 1,152 cases. 146 deaths, 70% people 80. 16% hospitalized, 3.5% ICU

This isn’t limited jurisdiction. It’s exactly data everywhere else earth seen months. don’t know people don’t get this. Yes get really sick even die you’re healthy young. also die young healthy flu. It’s incredibly rare incredibly unlucky. Literally like 98% people 60 don’t even get sick enough need hospital, let alone ICU, even fewer die. 

Again, people can’t comprehend this: NUMBERS EVERY COUNTRY EARTH SEES. war normal people Lol US = World yeah think ridicule, bubble Uh think confusing life expectancy birth population age distribution. It’s cool babies Thailand well now, doesn’t anything current pandemic. lag time covid takes 1-2 weeks spread. secondary spread protest family members/coworkers/friends exponential spread starts. 

Also since protestors young might milder symptoms too, would make first level barely register getting tested. 

Hopefully masks job outdoors helps. know early/mid July spike Northeast cities. Yep. wish people would comprehend this. Wikipedia article blood type percentages country. That's fair. Trump child's mentality. ""I can't wrong"" mindset spoiled child who's everything Same! going post myself, area city?

Honestly, hard understand.   That’s math works, try  news? Thanks, yes, really good points things thought/known about. Added complications social/psychological impacts clearcut either. Overwhelmed hospitals chaos short time, versus restrictions economic impact longer time. think agree going pleasant either way going long time really know what's happened might best...

What gingers?

Does every physical appearance characteristic also tested?

Are vaccines don’t function black people work everyone else?

Vaccines don’t work gingers? Blondes?  self-checkouts basically? I’m skeptical it’s lockdowns caused excess deaths. excess deaths article generally high places high virus toll, low nothing countries lockdown minimal virus toll period analyzed. Lockdowns tended lead less car accidents accidental deaths wouldn’t expect happen home even may increased causes death like suicides (that would make sense, haven’t seen study that). would bet excess deaths likely either undiagnosed virus victims people either could get quality care unrelated health problem understaffed hospital struggling virus people avoided hospital needed emergency care feared getting infected.

In long-term lockdowns may real consequences mortality consider children missing education, significant damage world economy, etc. hard see things wouldn’t happened without lockdowns too. Like Nicaragua schools open many parents understandably choosing keep kids home. Nick Saban head coach University Alabama college football team. best active coach CFB, maybe best CFB coach ever.

Meanwhile everywhere else world: ""is news posted march ?""  Yes... believe name. work can't, trying to, eradicate virus? Lockdowns always slowing spread. see (but absolutely willing convinced) staying locked longer would made things better, cases guaranteed rise matter lockdown lifted.

If want eradicate virus: lock hard cases go zero, somehow prevent new cases imported. case, longer lockdown better. trying that. 

But yes wish we'd wear masks go back real life. That's fantastic solution kills Americans listen. would categorize U psychopath well.

Edit: point post NJ hit peak **after** NYC, thought good idea open **before** NYC Supposedly. Supposedly official stance “we hope everyone right thing wear masks” know ain’t gonna happen there’s 0 chance Trump wearing one Keep telling that. Arizona sucks science seems indicate dangerous places extended time indoors without PPE. Anyone believes repeatable observations feelings. Finally, fucking asshole. 

I swear god, way many people think mask-wearing actual pandemic instead extremely dangerous virus spreading across world. China could invent covid19, everyone else kowtowing begging mercy. numbers sure.  Tianjin completely new regional area. 

It looks like China going address frozen food. One thing remember every covid+ patient seen ER covid admitted. peak surge see appendicitis+covid, broken bones+covid, suicidal ideation+covid. lot early symptoms, get tested come back week later admission. Arizona great [the went downhill. Check AZ's historical numbers. summer figure better system. know...it’s sick...which reason keep fighting back... No, not. like users like company. love God... fuck people ignore great masks actually containing germs.

ITS BEYOND said survive summer? likely spread less efficiently summer winter months people outside more. Plus, immune systems stronger summer. one saying going disappear summer. 

All compare warm weather sunny (not sub tropical) countries continents cold ones see big difference. spread much faster potent Northeast US cold months throughout Europe Africa, India, Florida, etc. India community spread covid winter would ten times worse right now. Americans travel world

I'm sure rectify that. also claims Singapore country SE Asia handling well, lockdowns don’t work generally seems like he’s promoting doomporn. Thing sucks florida extensive tourism. planes either. People drive over. like phone tracking showed spring break. FL could easily responsible outbreaks states counties really havent one yet. know tags work here, ""misleading title"" tag. Lots people skim sub instead reading everything. exactly enforced? won’t police. California experience issue NY facing. lot people simply care. Well, there's also case history like century professional medical practice probably hundreds thousands doctors nurses world-wide. . . Sure it’s billions trillions?

And safety issues unlikely vaccine used humans before. Same, however dreading debates follow ""high risk"" environment warrants mask, not. wear mask take walk park---everything read clearly specifies UNCROWDED, OUTDOOR areas low-risk, however sure people scream 'breaking law' still public area. think make claim opening testing people, sick along greater capacity lead surges. issue there; however, second part - deaths lag cases week two since takes time full progression. compare deaths week two see trended stayed low. fair, toilet paper shortage initially caused everyone pooping home rather work. glut industrial sized single ply shortage household size triple ply. supply chain prepared massive increase home use.

His predecessor thought breaking unemployment website would good idea less claims would get through, ones got screwed would poor, poor people vote good. Wtf wrong idiots? Trump's grave piss.

FTFY. think back mid-March whole country criticizing [teens young adults wanting party Spring protests came we're here.

I give up, like did. idea non scientist could know scientist subject ridiculous. Imagine applying literally job ""I think know woodworking carpenter I've watched YouTube videos"" sounds ridiculous, somehow works scientists. governor DeStupid waiting opportunity issue mask order, would good one. Many Americans general sense entitlement. Thank you! Fauci quack time retire Ok. You’ve gone discussing reopening accusing saying NYC 0 coronavirus cases, I’m going copy original comment circle back actual topic cool states 'doing well' feels premature celebrate anything imo. Reducing cases 0 reopening exposing state risk infection dealt outbreak.

This true multiple reasons. First, acknowledge it’s valid say two different Americas dealing COVID right now. There’s part America that’s seen huge numbers cases like Northeast, part COVID infections single digits like Alaska. big city many people exposed virus, collective immune systems different place March. Consider 50% people COVID don’t even know they’re asymptomatic, tests probably underestimate number people actually infected. People symptoms probably aren’t visiting testing centers. Many people epicenters virus- NYC, NJ, IL, etc immunity virus, utterly morbid, many vulnerable COVID areas already died it. virus experiences resurgence places (which don’t know will) cannot infect anyone survived developed immunity it, sizeable portion population. previous comment literally said wasn’t enough herd immunity, enough dampen number people resurgence virus could go through.

Additionally, public health situation right nowhere near March. taking example NYC, early March, NY state didn’t even working PCR test CDC. commission local labs design own. Compare today state running 50-70K tests per day. Therefore, risk uncontrolled transmission much lower cases actually identified, therefore quarantined contacts traced. early March, infected people running around clue coronavirus, spreading everyone else. Subways cleaned restaurants packed. Even NYC reopened today, would look different March. People wearing masks, careful sanitation, aren’t packing bars nightclubs (yet). again, risk transmission same.

Finally, you’re right rural places low herd immunity continue risk virus. rural places escaped virus particularly likely suddenly become high risk it. virus can’t spontaneously appear location; brought in. People Europe brought coronavirus NYC, huge numbers Italian Chinese tourists weren’t exactly visiting rural towns Montana. people free travel states even lockdown, I’m sure lifting lockdown reopening suddenly going put rural places high risk.

All all, I’m sure argument is. Even get 0 cases, can’t reopen? Reopening isn’t danger people it’s done intelligently. don’t need eliminate coronavirus it. I’m going point South Korea good example this. need public infrastructure test, contact trace, isolate, also encourage people wear masks stay vigilant. ""90% people Wuhan COVID-19 antibody"" article says it’s 60% yeah, there’s going lot death, healthcare services get overrun toll rise Yikes get that. get shutting everything hard 2 months. board slow opening, that's opening everything know spreads indoors better outdoors earth would open malls, movie theaters indoor dinging?  We're talking CA summertime. could things outside. Close main streets town cars let business take over. could get haircut nails outside. perfect summer weather this. feel like we've done going flatten curve, delay curve.

The lock beginning strict flatten it, stopped rules, we're going go spike. NYC antibody testing showed 20% infection. completely open another hump. justify holding it? I’m candidate thinks disposable. Vote me! required day 1 LA tons people without masks. Bars, restaurants retail stores open packed. expect number keep climbing. Oof, sucks. Hope avoid idiots!   Air Force One bringing deaths misery town. concerned Florida snow birds coming home back March April Florida seems regulations, thankfully COVID tight grasp yet. sure really it.

I've customers ask know anyone (I do) expecting agree hoax, thankfully rare. apparently riots??? whole idea exemptions stupid. health fragile can't wear breathable mask minutes go store house anyways. Get someone else go store you, end story, exemptions. guess maybe small children exempted parents taking store anyways. would laugh, I'm tired. Thanks trying though lol increased testing CA. test positivity rate still seems staying ~4.5%.

If increase testing everything else stays test positivity drop.

I agree CA bad spot AZ FL right now, slow spread.  Newsom making masks mandatory good start. give deadly virus someone serving you. Holy shit. US never learned this, that's quite shitty behaviour. amount people abandoned driving little nuts riverside I’m thankful see this. keep everyone safe. goal health crisis. he’s saying believes people wearing open defiance... like dude I’m willing sacrifice ego. 100% narcissistic quite possibly really expects us do...

I mean, could feasably contract COVID rally time. 

It makes sense risking it. raise 2% every year they're losing money inflation Let die it, alone.   It’s full shit emails like aol addresses five years. It’s demographic work. don’t think I’ve ever seen vaccine advertised.

And blondes? making sure include representative sample them?   that's fair answer.

IMHO...vaccine complete hopium. Treatments may work today, going work tomorrow.

Age range affected grow.

No permanent immunity...but many reports contrary...until aren't.

It's one thing wear mask visiting store...quite different one wear one whole work day....at point benefits outweigh positives. wearing one work...the last thing want wear one go out.  Got headache work wearing day. that's light surgical. Oxygen deficit = bueno.

But maybe retired? 

Also..when younger people go out...they want wear masks...they want check opposite sex. same...for some.

Y’all don’t realize actually barbaric views. You’re sick fuck think physical suffering acceptable punishment.

Incontrovertible facts statements end periods, question marks. Literally first sentence post question fact. ""My party refused compromise enough win progressive voters simultaneously telling vote worth changing for, yet somehow still fault lost."" TIL move there, lol Unfortunately, I'd assume cyber-bullying probably heading all-time high.  Reddit thousands test positive protests next week? I’m trying guess they’ll make political polarizing. Conspiracy theory...they might trying engineer outbreaks postpone elections. would've written crazy talk, bastards corrupt anyone imagine, put beyond them. postpone elections basically implement dictatorship need stupid supporters anymore. Cannot speak him, Australia, heard law enforcement officer ever speaking political beliefs, let alone political party would align with.  


Its batshit crazy. say lock door. defend murder, home invasion.

You easily wear mask, sanitize social distance lock doors, go gun range, take concealed carry class, go gun range. Arizona here: I'm seriously struggling think time I've seen even one middle aged white man wearing mask. white men older either. 

And yeah, parents around age bringing kids place (with nobody family wearing masks) common too. Like... would that??  ironic would give Magneto hard Pluto. Imagine converting grocery stores giant ""vending machines"". store enter, warehouse automated processes fetch items stock. need customers walk find things potentially stock certain shelves. Perhaps even keeping real time information store stock linked grocery store's website. Tap need external touchscreen, tap swipe card grab auto-bagged groceries dispensation platform. Maybe keep touchscreen every parking space keep lines forming behind customers shop lengthier durations.  Bless parts America ....Because god knows don’t enough sense help themselves.

You sound like someone that’s never here. AZ quite purple hence it’s swing state label Pinal county major contributor that. 

In addition going looking COVID numbers county county. counties still triple digits one less 20. It’s Maricopa county (Phoenix metro area) that’s making us look bad 5x next county.

Sincerely atheist Arizonan trying change us purple blue. Wages go down. That's tech companies want this. way outsource much possible. countries current nation-wide lockdown shit load cases: Ecuador, China (probably), Israel, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Panama, many many more.

Also, countries mentioned good testing (aside Germany), hard tell they're regards virus. Dear lord high heaven, may Trump, Pence, Xi Jinping, Kim Jong Un, autocratic piece shit get virus die. least suffer bigly. lot can’t turn buck take either. Take thin margins. Restaurant used rely dine numbers can’t live take numbers places solely take facing new competition everyone suddenly encouraging take out. going make educated guess say place testing Covid going good safeguards place. 

For reference, appointment get hemorrhoid look at/fingered (because apparently that's it) got temp checked asked questions door, mentioned slight cough allergies given better mask sent second round questions. Everything done masks social distancing (except one part...)

Granted I'm state cases, place testing station set 100 feet away parking lot, going see doctor handles whole different area, would say safe place specifically testing Covid. Let guess, going blame second wave trump rallies instead rioting looting zero social distancing protests?

I’m saying article shows may lose antibodies natural infection Covid. vaccine, i.e. unnatural infection, would specifically crafted confer stronger response body. Two different methods infection antibody creation.

Well it’s apples bicycles, it’s still apples oranges. much idea heat would kill virus. Uh... majority public believed experts beginning masks don’t work shouldn’t wear masks. guess what? wasn’t early April start wearing masks experts reversed stance it. think majority public great job listening. I'm sorry hope everyone around able stay safe despite idiotic local leader. Nothing makes sense anywhere.

In town, liquor stores head shops always deemed essential never closed, food bank next door close. Never ask government decide essential. good that.

Changing rooms clothing stores forbidden rest rooms ok. What?

But plan never stay closed forever. would cause harm good.

Fauci said staying closed long could cause ‘irreparable WFP estimates 300,000 day die mainly starvation result spite gradual re-openings, death count per day US trending since mid aug. see worldometer. would never know reading news people prefer read news specific areas seeing outbreaks instead big picture. example, calling Thursday means Friday Thursday Friday's work do.  Yeah, that's going make want wear mask.

(I anyway, record) New Zealand similar problem two self-entitled women lied symptoms break quarantine... Right. Clearly lied. That's everyone brain ability read understand context words voting oblivion. lol Sometimes, need understand give up. wrong dude. lie. matter bad want case never going be. means keep trying desperately convince people r/conservative going hard sell convince people understand bullshit bullshit reality. Good luck that. lol think protests fine, protesters need wear masks socially distance. half pictures see, people close together wearing masks. good approach, backfire. huge economic pressure find buyers vaccine doses, matter results trials are. know they’re business selling ads, daily headlines record-breaking positives covid spreads unchecked states big ol “no shit.” Yeah, someone Oxford said 80% chance working.  Shhh. don’t friends. Bar flies hate other, bartender world. go try nasty possible win type popularity contest doesn’t exist. don’t want happy fun want make sure everyone else miserable. Thy want go force people participate loneliness. 

Normal people drinks home friends beers porch like yo said. people don’t nice things people nobody nice things them. type person whose house you’d go type person people house. complain constantly world. Petrified anyone gets happiness. don’t care get sick long everyone else does. stalking you, worry it. first thought ""big city elitist""; I've come understand can't communicate effectively. I'm good ignoring crap write. seatbelts? laws like smoking age18 drinking 21. ways. need give people bone, want comply. Either get incentive, threat.

Yeah know avoid getting sick end dead good incentive, people get it. Palm Beach ICU beds already? indeed fucked. Could swore 116,000 like day ago. Exactly Wow hilarious Love username.

Stay safe. Stay strong. havent physically inside HEB plans whil. ""Wearing mask help stop spread disease unless INFECTED PERSON wear 

There lot people infected know it, they're also spreading virus unwillingly. argument everyone wear mask? Wear mask case virus, spread around everyone else. everyone that, lower infection rate. I'm leaning telling people sorry fucking sorry. I'm already tired vilified made fun demeaned trying keep family safe. several family members opened doors back willing outdoor things see friends others precautions well (masks, distancing) like shut family bunker yet that's I'm treated. Sorry, ranted rant. absolutely feel guilt say hell no. give crap that's entitled uncaring. kind shit need. hope works, reusable, cheap Numbers prove it’s going ok. fear mongering shit stop. Lowest rates country. 0.9% infection yesterday. Let’s live lives. Congrats 25 new cases sounds nice. yo read first sentence?

did you?  someone took steroids own? sell without proper prescription? mean beforehand. means went infected countless others protests. 0.006% population. number may large, actually look scale isn't. expect Nevada, Colorado, New Mexico follow within month. believe coalition corona procedures. Maybe Arizona sure whats going right now. I’ve done research trying find right mask wear there’s plenty info types masks regards illness flu. Studies articles prior covid explaining wearing mask doesn’t stop getting sick stops spread turn stops getting sick atleast prevent portion virus getting body. common knowledge masks recommended even pandemic people complicated immune systems. 

A years back last job (I work medical field) co worker mine going though chemo flu cold season asked spare masks did. told wear doctor going chemo. common recommendation. I’m gonna send sites I’ve researched recommend so. I’m unsure someone provide research find info someone would send. dick can’t even idk say open info. Hotels outdoor areas, summer south neither restaurants bars. aspects beach visit.

Putt-putt golf, Myrtle beach's single biggest attraction, probably fine wipe clubs. Yeah. Hope yields results soon. know Credibility statements Yuri Bezmenov said interesting things it. Yes!! glad they're mandatory. Please, please wear mask everybody's safety health! least get sweet herd immunity... considering Florida's daily cases doubled last week, fact lockdown, around week long incubation period feel like somewhat good bet pass NY peak case rate next 1-2 weeks. argument win. I'm fun point. place cesspool doom losers, occasional redditor exhibit qualities well adjusted, rational person, social life. like person, salute absolutely well thought out, data driven analysis - ""Florida 100% screwed"". see majored statistics too. case back march / April no? Ohio also. well. One first shut down. saw two masks day working trade driving truck around going businesses homes. Three I'd looked mirror. still confusing Trump rational person learn suffering.

He can't. won't. kids could drop dead thing would stop lying it. could vent month come thr wrong response. 

Trump serious personality disorder.  hard. good point agree IMO really lackluster reporting/media state that's way friendly politicians. gave watching daily briefings right whole hydroxychloriquine debacle quickly canceled. Someone media pool asked Herbert order responded something like ""I know canceled."" follow-up despite completely answering question *why order even made first place* without apparently knowing. That's even worse answer. state made big order unproven drugs administer possible COVID-19 patients without governor knowing? add, believe US Serum Institute India wear mask, selfish ignorant. option. Right, like Dr's office get vaccinations? Inside Whole Foods? Putting customers danger? also maintained booming economy... lmfao

this man said would ""civil war"" prevent infected New Yorkers traveling wherever want country

shameless apparently 11,000 active cases added 987 confirmed cases. live Australia, become CCP criticized opinion. Lmao. tho. estimated around 35-45%. cruise ship study saw 81%. UK seeing around 70-80%. Singapore stated every one symptomatic case, 1 asymptomatic case. Asymptomatic cases alot higher. also saying still get damage lungs asymptomatic know till done Fucking cowards. drive post office spot check concurred 0% restaurants following SJ. Money.

I think states realized much shutting destroyed state budgets. Every state I've seen articles indicated they'll making massive cuts community programs schools stay afloat.

Congress supporting states little relief packages sent out.

 many states indicated cannot afford shut without congressional funding.

Beyond that, several successful state challenges stay home orders. appeal fight challenges also expensive. Yeah, bandannas win guess. Keeping home forever getting... difficult. Science, philosophy, humanity general something priorities country. Science subjective word lot people somehow.  Americans: ""I right choose cant make me!"" Lol Yes, time, live Alaska. sometimes see moose people. (kidding).  mean open up, good public shaming. Fuck ""Christian"". Reddit keeps saying outside COVID-19 matter. Tell people protesting. denial think righteousness cause justifies it. lot ""people color"", especially black latino, going die protests. hard figure predict math this, year's time might extra 100,000 deaths more. 

Slow drawn deaths pandemics scare us directly humans killing is. That's quirk psychology. anti-police protestors falling logical traps right is. Yep, good approach once. probably enough preliminary findings high degree confidence take risk. I'm server. I'm young enough really financially stable choice back work. I'm comfortable long precautions made customers restaurant. 

But get people telling need wearing gloves setting food down? scared stupid, need staying home. fucking restaurant people make things *with hands*. pizza doesnt fucking toss itself, Connie.

I dont need people like ""worrying"" job. need order take shut fuck up. Japan resident here— masks absolutely saved Tokyo becoming NY 2.0. 

I get wearing masks cultural thing US, way Americans politicized common sense preventative measure boggles mind.  universe make sense? last, virus resurging US 40%+ population take use PPE social distancing public seriously. Work it.

People working earning $100k aren’t putting 40 hours week. could be, think positive rate tests also high. think instances, thee higher testiing theory debunked. I’ve beach SF pleased see people staying away generally wearing masks walking near anyone else.  Biohazard collectors going busy months...  thought Trump “unmasking”. guy can’t make mind up.

“Bolton revealing classified information, everything book lie!”

Dude, can’t cake eat Actually, would helped Trump, virus going major anchor around neck. He's stupid realized time.  Lol post even political. stupid fucking bot. can't control people feel, control one thing wearing mask. science supports it, medical community supports it, political issue. 

Wear fucking mask.

PS - fuck strawman Losing antibodies everything vaccine. 

""*Acquired immunity immunity develops exposure various antigens. immune system builds defense specific antigen. Passive immunity due antibodies produced body own*. ""

Granted, know exactly mechanisms form best protection immunity Covid; antibodies first line solution many viruses. I'm sorry man. I'm nurse. Served army medic Iraq, shifted oil &amp; gas while. I've seen best worst people. part, experience, people good mean right thing. Money politics create lot problems sure make small minority people, rich, seem like much massive problem are. Build wall! Thanks dickhead. done weeks ago! Hopefully people wear mask correct way like Wisconsin chin strap. accounts, Mucosal antibodies much accurate longer-lasting blood antibodies

And even then, antibodies still necessarily mean person lost immunity. preliminary data indicated T-Cells key here, retain memory even antibodies gon article read said increase due emergence backlogged test results. way knowing that’s actually true. Sounds like fun. cousin went blast. realize Sweden small country small population, right? Pennsylvanian brain... Thank God wolf charge morons. honestly can't comprehend stupidity behind people refusing wear masks point. makes brain hurt.

(Not talking people valid medical reasons wear masks here, FYI. cases far between, legitimate. rest people fucking stupid) hope guy writes book someday, destroying Trump course. God think? hey Trumps gut, rarely wrong😐 important part college like networking relationships daily new case count New Jersey peak. Indicating New Jersey sized outbreak minimum. Ummm said things fine things fine. 20-somethings fault wear masks anyways!!!


/s (all paraphrased Abbott) reason, feel like fans golf events allowed. A) seats shared space B) outdoors spread out. I'm hoping theme park reopenings help us reconsider sporting events fans Blind faith anything bad idea, whether politician religion. Probably back log tests nothing see control economy better control virus.
No one needs banned earning. needed real shutdown 6/7 weeks. defending imaginary freedom important. 
The financial blow pandemic softened subsidy program workers able keep paying bills businesses hire train entirely new set employees crisis ends. 

America half baked lockdown work hurt economy reopening also managed keep people employed. 
In United States, stimulus relief programs good avoiding layoffs.
Is easier recover short stricter lockdown prolonged pain decided follow. 
Also consumer confidence real, business close covid cases staff how's helping keeping people earning livelihood ? Website reverted 6/17 numbers initially reporting 450 new cases 6/18.

Edit: 6/18 back up. girl studied college believes exact thing, degree fucking bioscience engineering. *whole degree* based upon evolution, fuck work tech feel 100% fine this. Doesn’t matter, doctors nurses staff them.

Travel docs nurses largely tapped nation wide demand current supply doctors nurses already works drastically long hours high patient loads. reopened we're still pre-epidemic movement. happens around September school starts, people wear masks, go more. Deaths expected summer. fact still high conerning actually. live wear mask every day anytime go out. bother much. I'd rather little uncomfortable contribute spread. like one layer potential viruses. looked comment history see coming from. link sources saying gloves matter. get choose, choice I've made.

It's interesting response comment gotten hassled PPE real life, right *am* getting hassled internet. ;-) Yes, Yup. checked twitter page OC Register, replies explosive growth **lot** states. already +23000 even 6 PM east coast. 

think get +27,000 least. Don’t consider it. it.  didnt always lie us maybe we'd believe Agreed. People thinking masks places hard hit coming down. Florida nothing forever masks. think masks spiking. one wants admit unpredictability pandemic think hard work. totally masks, moreso distancing. worried everyone masks another wave people freak cali hit 4k+ reason earth flat, that's is. know way save thousands dollars year case. Dont kids, simple.  11 children 7 staff. do, dependant?

Full disclosure: 40. case united states, considering little done time lockdown bought, delaying deaths saving lives Outdoor ceremony, indoor reception. Also wedding shower bachelorette party week, although haven’t heard venues yet. get haircut. countries social system place help people temporarily can't work economically fired. 'Social' 'America' go along well, unfortunatly, US that's case. can't work, luck. That's 15% Americans currently unemployed without garantee ever re-hired. long-lasting lockdown would fatal current American economy.

Does mean leaving lockdown prematurely justified? Ofcourse not! good leader US could temporarily implented federally-funded emergency system helped citizens first-world country would. Instead Trump put head sand let everyone figure things themselves. I’m strong believer masks, someone wear 8hrs day empathize workers taking breaks wearing incorrectly. us didn’t sign wear ppe similar medical worker daily lives. know experience I’m getting headaches everyday migraines several times week now. I’v really considering changing careers it. Also Iv worked lot medical workers, complaints mask protocol. First wave never stopped. Can't teach common sense unfortunately world would better shape. 😓 People coughed yelled racist comments. We’ll fine

/s remember, reason even think education makes liberal stop wearing seabelt, bc ""freedom ! USa country liberty. better die without driving &amp; cannot move will. Seabelt chinese Hoax makes Trump looks bad &amp; teh damn world falling it"" Rant away! appreciate response. Many family members people city attitude you’ve experiencing. It’s like people decided bored restrictions said screw it. agree gets upset severs friendship says lot. Thanks encouragement! got wrong timeline, turns already living world. news... Water wet. free country. give damn police state free stay home lick boots. need make parents avoid like plague, going risk getting covid like that, parents need see all. seems already few. 
[link imagine went solitary confinement voluntarily. dont see scare could ""perpetuated"" literally sick. cant fabricate virus scare nearly entire population prison infected. Thats pretty dumb. Oh brother. duping someone full insurance ""full pop"" ""strikeout"" weeks come back ""WHY FUCK BILL $2000 DOLLARS!"" Well, wrote much per day, multiplied number days wanted it... wrote right here...

All comission lolol!

Managers like ESQUI LOW!

It good experience looking back it, every job I've since feels like vacation. Plus girls REALLY hot everyone super dope personality. Made awesome friends. note, shitty racism still exist well beyond pandemic, perhaps fewer humans call fight it. protests looting large crowds ok? religious fanatics specific, religion way much power American politics .  Seriously. one believes wearing mask.   sub going wake up, live Iowa we’ve wide open 3+ weeks, never issued shelter place, literally riots thousands people close quarters, spring breaks, memorial days, farmers markets, people shopping masks still 300 new cases day. Still 15 deaths day. population 3 million. still don’t know anyone personally corona. top 15 states infected per 100,000. It’s always 2 weeks dooms day. believed know doesn’t kill everyone, it’s contagious thought. worked whole time come contact general public top 10 county nation. long keep good hygiene practices, wash hands, don’t cough people it’s ok. Get safe space. Never gonna give up?

(Did guess right?) Cuomo also bitched RI state troopers asking NYers quarantine live country population 5 million people. 

We No.12 rankings C-19 mortalities. 

*Frightening - it?* 

Almost many people died - per million head capita - US.

*Terrifying - it?* 

We've per capita deaths Brazil.

*Enough make wet bed night - it?*

The number deaths attributed Covid ... guess many? 

Go - guess. 

5 million people + killer virus + pandemic = *how many deaths*? 

In country deaths per head Brazil slightly less US?

In country - shock horror - practically *nobody wears masks*? 

In country pretty much *everyone* \- [including Prime \- *flouts social distancing rules*?

How many think died?

Tens thousands? 

Hundreds thousands? 

The answer 1,714. 

That's pretty much *same number people died period last 3 years respiratory diseases* country.

I'm saying C-19 kill - I'm saying: *this disease dangerous dangerous*. 

So yeah, wish carry utterly terrified, go ahead - frightened, terrified. That's choice. Florida mindset ""I know anyone got exist"" Alright thanks update. Going check one area doing. since found places go shop curious improved. That's bingo! bring quote alot whenever someone wondering everything terrible. side needs make deal side.

""Wear mask go baseball game.""

Fine, would guess.

Right ""do say take away everything love.""

Some people flat rebel. 

You something different get rebels board fact. Yet deaths increased. First make (warranted) fuss increased testing, increased testing going yield increased cases. That's math... would say people parents save money like that. hopefully I'm wrong. wait till Joe Rogan knucklehead infects UFC roster still left first wave. cases dropped US like everywhere else. People giving up. Yup. Left Right experiencing symptoms great point Italy 139 days it. Orange county announced masks public starting Saturday. Probably better wait see year’s hurricane season plays out... lead us come took long though? Florida open around month point, seeing numbers like sooner? remember point Illinois Florida similar numbers cases, Illinois shut bunch stuff, Florida basically nothing, Illinois surged ahead total cases still ahead tens thousands cases. come? 

(Btw know question comes off, I'm 100% serious). Yes  Trump president either...but how, that's true too. Boom. Case point. real, dude fuckin

Candlejacked? sure Dr. Evil incarnate friend ... aarrghh I'm 57. sister 1 year older convinced Bill Gates wants microchip us, saw facebook.... something do, refuse see her. going give opportunity infect knowing reckless behavior, hold fault putting risk. I'm always impressed US finds ""new"" ""exciting"" ways excel things.

I wish apocalyptic things. Oh no, book! right's weakness... Charlotte too, please? Fuck guy Testing less 1% population going contain future outbreaks especially since many infections asymptomatic. South Korea China unable contact trace current outbreaks best day NY 5-10x worst day. It’s simple really. People stayed home infections dropped. People going infections increase. questions tolerance infections deaths point long disciplined prevention methods. im ""only"" showing +3200...source? bars restaurants etc open Netherlands? also, long open for? It’d good know opening meant cases still decrease post already removed terrible research gate ""paper"". Stop pushing pseudoscience. repurpose German tracker? open sourced yesterday. Median expression symptoms 5-6 days, 3 standard deviations 14 days. first protest Houston May 28. week past that. Covidiot FTFY defended Rogan 2 years.....now concede.

He vector propaganda.

He thinks watch cable news independent thinker get information social media circle people circulate talking points, get psychologically infected...as anyone would.

With number people listen him, everything come mouth regarding pandemic virtually guaranteed indirectly caused death.

One person could potentially infect 59,000 people

With death rate 2-4% infected that's 1180 2340 deaths.

Joe Rogan 30 listeners per month.

Just look damage done ONE person decides wear mask Joe Rogan says ""unmanly"". Sorry, that's true. insinuated black opponent would monkey office..he’s racist fuck almost laughable level yet still sadly...🥵 Tests Covid-19 completely free drive-throughs Australia. family tested 2 weeks back results back, (via phone-calls) 24 hours later.  expecting fast food high school job? would bet lot money would major surge cases New York now. reporting happened? hell get hours cut, Target one stores open struggling even come close normal levels incredible shitness? store's shelves mostly empty (normally 25% empty), even attempting fill them?  quote ""Is scary think summer virus survive?"" WPTV journalist Michelle Quesada asked Diaz. Almost every protestor I’ve seen wearing mask they've heavily increasing tests. Deaths going along increased number confirmed positive tests. Neither hospitalizations. We’re risk and, no, sounds like worried you. It’s group effort stamp something affects populace. long still one person virus transfer to, keep going. Think like fire, dry forest. One little spark burn entire thing down. 

I’m sorry feel like it’s tragedy would sacrifice one year hopefully 90-year old life could get rid virus giving people lifelong issues won’t recover from. 

P.s.- virus isn’t weak it’s affecting people’s quality life degree amputations, transplants, dialysis requirements. Houston protests began four days Memorial Day. don’t think realistically separate two. Everyone know who’s around retail world says Target better walmart large retailers.  could predicted thing would happen again? may also percentage people produce strong enough response first time around. seems person minor symptoms first time, maybe factor. 

Frankly happen everyone vaccine going work pretty much screwed anyway. I’ll try find article know read someplace around 15% people developing CFS Coronavirus. articles starting label people lasting symptoms long haulers. Agree clarify official convention still NC. he'll arena FL accept nomination. fooled. worst offenders. Temperature extremes whether hot cold cause people go indoors air shared people thus causing transmission problem bullying one cares becomes school shooting None AL friends/family knows anyone even it. take light precautions times face value, show brief. Eg Wear masks first 30 minutes church service, nothing last 30 minutes. practical disregard health distancing, even serious comorbidities, interesting.

It's discussed real, air disbelief. Could provide actual source that, confirmed tests, considering Sweden testing more? Well let know bridge sell That's whole idea beginning; tell people make good decisions rather enforcing it. nice situation trust people government high enough often need make recommendations people follow it. covid worked well enough. good still believe people. Cherish that. parts sub-Saharan Africa malaria endemic. LOL! uneven seen group like WANTS bodies pile prove point?! dont, ""good news"" cult pushing drug pretty hard recently. believe social distancing + masks, better social distancing + masks?

How believe prevent outbreaks best way? Exactly. agree. Reddit. gonna circle jerk I’m similar situation. Got March. started feeling better stopped nebulizing albuterol got hit second wave. feeling lot better weeding week lungs feeling like crap again. 

I know lot people Covid Positive group complain much activity seems trigger another wave. march towards Herd immunity? No, we're fucking crawling towards it. country even close it. hire kids know is, way make money school, rather thank McDonalds hires single mother 4 kids expecting 20/hr. Yes, Houston/Harris County temporary hospital standby NRG stadium. Keep stating obvious nearly half year half still don’t believe guy resurrected two month old thread made non sequitur reply.  NY states? B/c NY, numbers keep dropping testing increased 70k+ day Type blood common blood type world, no? Im confused, you’re minimum wage postion expecting thank fast food company?

Unless left would anyone randomly expect thank company? make people think actually effort testing whether HCQ works ? block people access HCQ blocking HCQ supply people forced get hospital take Remdesivir ? 

I question you. corona started, many researchers studies SARS already said HCQ antiviral would probably work given early on. done randomized clinical trial early infected covid19 patients yet ? 

I another question. test vaccines phase 1 inject vaccine young healthy individuals. However, covid trials instead testing less ill patients infected early on, trials extremely ill patients already hospitalized ? 

Third last question … care explain data ? 
 AP story [this Washington Post directly contradict one another. WaPo says Beijing seeing second wave, cancelled 1,200 flights yesterday, returning lockdown, closing schools. They're franchises location different, seem pay vs vs vs Thought like arid zone. Arid Florida. Umm yeah did. That’s shit ton people still think virus man made. that’s I’m looking consistency position gatherings. personally favor allowing happen someone opposed, respect opinion don’t pick choose gatherings ok with. disapprove say, defend death*** right say it.

***your death, mine tell confirmed positive covid March still feel right. Seems like every time sleep enough drink alcohol start feel symptoms again, like odd chest pains, scary. OPINION stating facts think stays us immune system falters tries re-emerge. thats plan fine argue merits staying open anyway. However mandating masks basic capacity reduction indoors could go long way slowing curve. UK government longer care reckon. wasted lockdown time can't afford another one. think generally going try herd immunity, virus already devestated vunerable Jesus christ...seriously? boomers see. first ones rushing new thing opens. Ripping masks inside, pulling down. Poor NY 1% positive test rate. Deaths 17 yesterday. Cases 600. AZ, TX, FL, others worse NY now. Saying worse everywhere else still false. Comfort's issue logistics, army protocols non-COVID hospital slowed things down. India becoming hotspot ave potential become country covid cases fast.

Poor population huge density deadly combo virus. Masks simplest effective measure use mitigate spread vaccine available.

But masks alone insufficient. Hence still wrong. Everyone needs Jerry Gergich. Show pls mean don’t drink piss? don’t like much go around chugging hot foamy glasses human urine, dude. fucked majorly elderly homes. tried putting complete lockdown pretty much, took like days third elderly homes Stockholm infected. IIRC around 3000 total 5000 deaths elderly homes.

Our whole idea based trusting people take responsibility make smart decisions themselves, rather enforcing it. Although think worked better strategy would countries, people taking seriously enough. idea covid came Stockholm right now, there's nothing would suggest we're pandemic.

I think lot people going shopping week instead multiple times, they're store one keeps distance.

I work delivery driver online grocery store we've seen massive increase customers since began, almost everyone deliver great keeping distance (we place groceries door, ring doorbell back off, times I've customers hear outside door come knock). lot people should, still enough people dangerous. Lupus patients conditions HCQ actually works denied medication due Trump buying every dose could find. Trump literally putting many peoples lives jeopardy result. helped nothing regards pandemic made people covid19 sick ended hospital result potentially exposing covid19. Stop defending shit.  peoples lives talking damn respect. applies super small countries, anecdotic evidence may disrupt statistics. Sweden population millions. can't considered small country effects. Please stop making shit up. It’s not. live near Philly, work NYC. good. Completely avoided first wave, it’s hitting now. virus never chance attenuate California. Close 20% Australian deaths one nursing home Nz similar problem think 50% one location. Nursing homes meat packing facilities seem real problem locations even significant precautions taken. 😯 landlord, sentiment regards rent. would rather keep good tenant home make extra bucks every year. house managed rental agency every year try raise rent 2-3% tell every year. 

Only time would consider raising rate current tenant letting problems home fester point causing pay expensive fixes. ensure tenant signs lease even minor problem inform rental agency get taken care of. repair 200$ agency handles immediately without contacting streamline process. 

I wrote say happy renter makes happy owner. mutually benificial relationship. month without renter month pay mortgage pocket. 100% correct, right turning former Labor MP help designing ""stimulus package"". Damn seems expensive me. Around here, get pretty nice house 200-400k. state sucks, real estate tends cheaper. Oh no, he's got mild cold, whatever do!?!   absolute worst thing velocity money unprecedented accumulation among 1% population? could wrong, remember reading metric used show little 99% money moves since rest us compete use small percentage total that's circulation. Whereas prior 1990 so, case. No, he's saying that, quite clearly. Many countries handling far better greater humility humanity. unfortunate live Anerica. Kind like sucks born Uganda; life better far safer elsewhere. genuinely see Uganda Congo safer US. There's poor evidence coronavirus transmitted via surfaces. note article specify woman hospitalized due covid. admitted hospital today, getting tested covid happened test positive.

It specify current medical condition relation covid. scary virus could potentially reactivate, also think article little misleading... weird many population still deny despite evidence what's going on.

I know. quite concerning. weird common people reddit.

Even big newspapers Sweden critical, written published several pieces strategy failed, PHA admit misjudging virus, believe I've read couple articles topic denying herd immunity well. seems norm take part type media, written otherwise. suddenly log reddit comes deniers. mean, fare, almost week's pay worked grocery store last year. nothing increase? thought rents dropping. Try reduction. want repaint place empty, possibly months eventually take less?
Even intention moving, hit realtor sites get comparable units quoted less. currently trying save house renting sucks nuts. bad kind hope housing crash prices drop start looking place? actually complicated title suggests. get plane Beijing parts China need meet 3 conditions:

1. destination government health commission rules allow travel, eg blanket ban people Beijing

2. green Beijing health QR code

3. negative PCR test result done 7 days ago. really obvious since people position are, large, still working. Young athletes gotten virus recovered would like point dying make virus less bad. Incapacitated weeks, several lung problems despite cured long-lasting damage covid. One talking unable sing like used to. know many people put toothbrush toothpaste waterpik floss right nearby...

And water cup hand towel and...well get idea. Cause that's true really feel like taken Harvard study order realize this. Yes, please 🙏 Yeah, well times change. Shit expensive now, jobs pay well. Pretty sure parents could pay college working summer part-time job semester. 

My dad provided family 7 mom stayed home us kids. many people manage days? Hopefully never fully recovered. didn’t test positive first time long ago, would mean dead lung fragments would still present. would really stink could get reinfected twice, hasn’t one case 100% happened I’m holding hope. 12000* loved Bill Burr call Rogan said bullshit: 
 
""Masks bitches"" 
 
""Oh god, tough open nose throat"" stupid then. example stupid protest would still stupid now. might argue BLM protests worth Covid safety point view least legitimate grievance. politician willing openly think scenario? telling us grandparents would want sacrifice economy last March April. herd immunity though, many people get going home Scott free. Young athletes gotten virus, totally incapacitated 2 weeks, lung problems lasting damage. still unclear lasting damage permanent not.

I wonder related brain injury COVID per u/mrgrey5 : “The News, observations data, common sense.” let's hope doesnt end like ddt New Jersey. could wrong, believe strictest requirements (in terms actual policy, believe strict even NYC). makes sense since we're densely populated state. 

Governor Phil Murphy has, imo, done better job governor country. Even now, realizes offices work places previous outbreak sources (something trust Cuomo on), state continue UE feel work conditions dangerous employers taking necessary precautions.

These reasons we're flattening curve, we're beginning crush well.

As I've able things recently seem relatively safe like getting together family BBQ (still distancing, staying house, wearing masks eating) feel lucky live NJ Governor cares.

Not that, puts ego aside goes talks Trump still works get state needs without turning political theater. Hahahahaha ironic part eye roll mask protect them, ourselves. ? What's ""many""? dozen millions infections really statistically significant. swear god, lot landlords seem like major pieces shit. live south Scania honestly people love current situation almost travel.
So much trouble crime use open borders, think could well end EU Schengen, life better limited access. Wow, asshole. Technological progress made PEOPLE wealthy...  talking vaccine interview. Claiming arguing bad faith. talking sympathising UK's early strategy herd 60 percent population - 40 million people - gets **infected**, country build so-called herd immunity neither corona outbreak similar diseases future able take hold.

He later goes Sweden achieve herd immunity, six million people would **infected virus**. - Yes, time must remember vast majority mildly ill. (...). - Although sounds lot, maybe one 60 percent gets really ill maybe five-six percent need form care. smear five-six percent period six-eight-ten-twelve months, manageable health care.  millions people die cancer, heart attacks, car accidents supports idea stay fuck home forever. Except... stay home annihilate economy due things. exactly - body gets flu symptoms. Gf cant deal stays away vaccine. Honestly, point doesnt matter. may well start continue shooting herd immunity.

Yep, thinking mythology Bronze Age nomads must literally true huge part problem. saying stop breathing necessarily slow breathing down, means able form sentence next breath. gasping air every word two. Yup, doctor said probably flu. Take ibuprofen rest, still symptoms 2 weeks come see me. Yup  lockdown 2 going happen. ready mass graves instead. Cuz Americans give fuck Americans. 2 years now, they'll happy post thoughts prayers lost family 2020 Pandemic Cult behavior general dipshittery.

Also wear mask. read it. authors claim 10x less fatal etc. yet cite sources numbers. them. I've rebutting stuff two months. honesty, energy moment hoping someone might pick slack. Border control racist evil happen. Great News! Idiots beware. bad.

This one falls Undebateable. Like living round earth, sun center, religion fake, vanilla besr flavor. Same.

Anyone work hard, learn trade, make good money.

The OP wanted work far less hours far pay, there’s much value get employee. Yet opt getting OS update Movie theaters opening soon Ohio. Hippa. teacher doctor? God damn people fucking mind numbing sometimes. I'm curious know percentage nursing home residents NJ die given year. see less nursing home deaths next year?

It's anecdotal, work elderly population know people retirement/nursing homes passed away COVID completely agree you. 90s health issues. severe memory issues and/or limited mobility shells former selves. annual cost care enormous. given choice, many people choose quality life. wouldn't. 

It saddens died alone. Honestly, saying something like immediate forceful removal office. People bad exponential growth. 200 cases goes 400 look like spike, goes 800 look like spike, goes 1600 people start looking around, goes 3200 everyone freaks warned. LOLOLOL case, liberty death see met ex. We'll see comes this. Still plenty time. :) going definition long hot summer. /r/ivermectin data seems nothing like IgG prevalence 89.8% (95% CI 88.2-91.3%) COVID-19 patients, 4.0% (95% CI 3.4-4.7%) healthcare providers, 4.6 (95% CI 4.3-4.9 %) general workers, 1.0% patients (p &lt;0.001 comparisons COVID-19 patients).

This saying 90% people hospital still antibodies (or ""10% lose antibodies within [dozens of] weeks"", headline says). Antibodies found much people, draw conclusions since idea many havent already.. Land borders first thing shut down.

And dont give ""Constitution"" crap. guys wrote damned thing couldnt known something like could happened, would added aide note case.

Hell. far know, people modern day civilization thought would explode did. droplets nose breathing, virus likes take root nasal cavity. helping everyone themselves. almost got fired Becuase made Facebook post saying reported DHEC. Nothing changed hopefully locals saw stay away high risk. New York. 

The hotspots shifted. Sun Belt region getting ravaged exponential growth. Starting Virginia moving East Coast, plus upper Midwest, infection rates declining.  read article? contrarian - told wearing mask intended protect wearer, protect wearer could infect. that's true, like seatbelt laws all, protect wearer driver. don’t anticipate people didn’t pay rent past three months sudden coming enough money pay landlords back anytime soon.

I’ve never property vacant longer took rehab next tenant I’ve always bought near best schools military towns there’s tons people moving areas time. 90% tenants military, referrals current tenants connecting people moving area offering homes.

I’m simply eliminating risk 10%. went ton stairs N95 mask felt like going pass out. breathing soooo hard. Granted I’m great shape. cloth masks much easier breath Damn dude hijacked thread vegan-vs-meat discussion, would like bring back track - going extract 30-45 Litres plasma every month specifically genetically engineered cows; plasma contains ""polyclonal antibodies"" generated said cows' immune system fights virus. depend recovering human patients donating blood plasma complications come that, use specifically engineered cows.

Send virology questions comments twiv@microbe.tv numbers going Tennessee. People NYC live top other, majority rely public transportation. New Zealand entirety 5 million people live spread out. NYC alone 8 million residents. I've struggling futility recently. live one states wholesale rejects severity pandemic, upper levels government average citizen. spiking harder ever still see people going partying going restaurants more. still going responsible wear mask possible, I'm starting think young person pre-existing conditions refraining voluntary activities damaging mental health.

I'll still practice precautions going stores involuntary activities, vulnerable person goes restaurant point, going get infected I'm not. bullshit bunch selfish assholes decided hold little longer, practice safer methods going things hard work hard work mean nothing.

Am crazy feeling way? milestone proud of. need someone either talk something, really expecting anyone respond want throw thoughts hopefully help make mind. 

I live Canada BC 200 active (known) cases covid-19. got laid job month half ago. live family (university student) convinced family go cabin everything gets control close chance could get effected much there. really house anything involves people, besides grocery shopping like, since getting laid job I've always wearing mask I've sort building. concerned dying virus risk ages major underlying health conditions concerned carrying virus someone else. lot enjoyed involved road-tripping, thrift shopping, movie theatres, museums etc I'm starting go little crazy.

A friend mine invited board game night (something enjoyed this) I'm torn good idea go could done safely. four us total everyone else still working therefore could contact many many people I've contact with.

I know safest thing go know draw line messing life mental health still worried potentially hurting someone else. downvotes considered downvoted oblivion?

Let’s change subject, instead focus argue facts presented. 

If still don’t get lied presented facts evidence. Ya, maybe you’re right. give up. cuts public education talking about? Education spending per capita increased.  That's probably good way end dead lol hope case. try prevent death disease won’t give access money. terrorism. considered act war citizens. like American people's attention span minutes long. 

MaYbE TeST LeSs. -Trump Oh fuck live California.

Welp, ain't leaving house looonnnggg while. current trajectory keep mentioning? one keeps confirming USA worse every day? Let’s go Maryland!!! Woohoo Vaccination needs mandatory. idiots refuse it, denied medical care, jobs, housing, buniness entry. Deny opportunities spread it.
We'll need good vaccination ID system can't forged though. ""doctor's note"" do.
Personally, I'll get every vaccine that's available ti me. Welp, looks like time find new family. Damn it, always feed trolls... Michigander here. Folks sure moving covid precautions, lot testing capacity contact tracing process running. Mask usage hit miss, people seem exercise bigger personal bubble times.

We another surge cases point sure, things look way better month reopening thought would. me, feels like eye hurricane would love wrong that. doubling rate 3-5 days. That’s “two weeks” started. Three five doublings time. Awesome. cancelled appointment stylist told salon OC wasn’t requiring masks. believe shown bogus. stats saw early march show excess pneumonia deaths vs previous years, nowhere near big difference. Like less 100 March; significant huge figure.If I'm mistaken it, thought bad reporting done took off.My brother works ICU Brevard County, he'd know overrun patients regardless stats called deaths. 


Edit: article saw much smaller (though important) number.   point ""start killing loved ones fear."" Yeah believe is. drivers. want disclose location, definitely nose eatery around.
Side note: pickup (smoothie shop) 4 different days one one day, staff face cover, next 2 last time on. thought rather strange? btw back back days. 120,000 dead US says otherwise driving.
It's wearing seatbelt.
Like mask. nice places OC? want visit sometime Ahh yes, cuz fine work 2 jobs barely make ends meet. average citizen make close 100k year. People underpaid, it’s cuz theyre lazy. Grow pair mandate derro wanker! seem stop 😬 might due critical shortage PPE several months ago. think government officials scared hospital workers access PPE needed it, especially normal civilians buying PPE. Now, seems larger supply reasonably demand civilians wear it. Exactly. insane people completely denial CLOSE friend family member becomes ill they're making posts saying, ""I think big deal experienced firsthand."" I've really awe level stupidity, selfishness narcissism display past months. honesty, read it? I'm saying right wrong, genuinely curious hear rebuttal. liberty give death

Looks like already picked. argument wrong. I’m misconstruing anything. can’t understand concept post-infective immunity doesn’t mean I’m saying anything incorrect. 

I literally said thing comments quoted on, changing position? immunity = less people infect. second wave definition risk infection first. What's latest long virus travel air, indoors, outdoors, long virus survive air? adorable wish would end nice idea theory, hard enforce picked hollywood first....but would go decades demonizing right leaning media publications. Ya haha. mean don’t keep buying college students trying so? Oh \[sigh\]. really somethin'. suppose next thing we'll fight public health crisis propose sweeping tax cuts too. Masks social distancing -- well, that's dumb; really need tax cuts, vacation vouchers, Disney World, cruise ships.

I wish could put /s end that. Behold, Universal Orlando's Volcano Bay waterpark one week longer look worse gets. Theme parks fucking evil reopening. UK. would readibly available people NHS. Unfortunately cannot edit titles submission. big deal, worry it. Threats surgically implanting masks appeal resistant wearing them.

Edit: everything always debate. thing one size fits He’s gonna shit death sees many protesters wearing masks. trust science Fauci WHO, especially say ""no evidence."" responsible least thousands lives misinterpreting scientific evidence spreading misinformation regarding masks. inflammatory ask public safety pandemic? literally told someone none sources accurate academia far left. entirety. 

And goes even that. Teachers teach critical thinking skills dumb know talking about. Smart kids go state colleges begin make decisions based empirical data ridiculed shunned (I still remember told, multiple times, thought knew everything stopped talking side family). Book learning suspect personal experience/age held meaningful.

There's also lot ""fake"" book learning. Statistics taken face value agree specific narrative rest dropped (arguably bipartisan problem) conservative side, especially, human aspect decision making removed.

""The people dying (note all) old 1% people die this. Plus, young healthy. There's logic wearing mask. afraid, wear mask, stay home want to.""

It leaves numbers low, country make decisions solely based numbers also take account moral thing do. Statistically likely die car accident plane crash. number plane deaths year US infinitesimal compared causes death, yet planes still mandated meet rigid safety standards contain enough life savings equipment passengers crew.

The number infants toddlers killed hot cars also miniscule number, campaigns year remind exhausted parents check enter offices strangers call police see child left car.

Flu kills far less COVID-19 even vaccine bad match, scientists see 50k deaths bad season ask prevent more. massive campaigns remind Americans get flu shots year.

Following logic 1% small, take action prevent things, moral thing prevent unnecessary deaths. case, wearing mask socially distancing simple steps taken prevent death, anti science confirmation biases made huge political issues.  would riots people would try flee second rumors started. golfed high school could call bit athlete. could step Tom Brady whenever need. Exactly. could parents put room without food comply.

People ridiculous. Would tell battered wife get defy husband? That's telling young person dependent parents do. like idea much emotional psychological power parent kids. 18 magically stop either. 

Truth easiest thing world abuse power parent. Even good ones sometimes. kid can't shit. really consequences it. upset friend, could lose friend. bad colleague co workers make things harder you. Kids get things taken them, abuse power even minor side. That's best parent constantly evaluate afraid criticize apologize. many people stuck rut constantly validating actions this.  Especially huge number people refuse wear them. bullshitting hear you, one gig jobs wearing good 30 plus pounds Ye olde wench wear, joyful 95 pint bring people say trust experts, smart-ass reddit thinks knows better.  except lot powerful people want happen, save economy!!! lmao google unsmooth brain trolling choosing willfully ignorant

Same applies you, must talk glorification gang culture crack boom result poor income inequality innercity blacks peers races led massive illegal drug market alongside creation gangs like Bloods Crypts leading crime bill even black community vouched congress pass would later impact minorities hardest three strike rule? mean directly affects prison populations exceptionally vulnerable Covid. mean shit also talk Natives plight really want, directly ignored public, including blacks empathy sympathy due similarity treatment, also lack basic services say healthcare, drug reform, etc.

We go obesity overweight blamed myriad health problems doctors despite actual cause completely different thing roughly 40% times, go recent backpedal gay's rights healthcare too. medical industry without massive, glaring holes widespread discrimination honestly want go million ways end going it.

My point little blacks specifically. assume poor whites also dying result Covid? Cause got fucking bridge sell believe virus discriminates based skin color. Blacks specifically dying *more often* natural result efforts redlining **several generations ago** makes near impossible many actually climb poverty means lack solid means get say health insurance workplace actual access well staffed hospitals. Sure dogshit homeless whites also dropping dead hot centers like homeless literally race is, blaming racism literally every single god damn thing tone deaf ignoring main reason racism used tool rich enough multiple entire media networks worth millions.

It literally always comes back money power. Blacks lack money power systematic push keep low wage slaves due failure actually reform southern confederates post Lincoln, failure push workers rights MLK Jr. assassinated, failure address point systematic oppression failure give economically hurting actual opportunities excel led hundreds blacks joining gangs dying turf later led systematically oppressed arrested record numbers, MILLIONS losing voice politically due failure actually functioning justice system. 

In objective look death rate infants US exceptionally high based entirely state without even factoring race absolute **main** line sand economical impact: MAKE money baby gets live, crap shoot, far many nations functioning healthcare system many still developing functional system do. look Covid deaths systematically dead anywhere else: ***wwwwhhhhhyyyyy?*** power failed actively force proper shutdown would save hundreds thousands, potentially millions lives simply keep stock market facade functional economy going. got whites, hispanics, latinos, asians, natives, blacks more, forced working business refused stay closed safety rich people like Elon Musk outright refusing actively take consideration health account ala Tesla facility, got meat plant workers infected hundreds result corporate greed, got efforts generational red lining never fully fixed showing main use way harm minority communities due failure actually decentralize desegregate many due lack income opportunity legitimately climb move out.

Shit must turn every god damn thing race issue might well go many trans people killed every year ignored literally every fucking race bigots universal god damn thing, includes discrimination healthcare, among poor homeless, among social workers schooling, among employment. god damn can't go five fucking seconds without turning everything Oppression Olympics event.  Oh shit. Like Javits Center NYC. Corona Extra. think Goblet Fire. microwave takeouts 1 min clean plate home. dirty hands cary microwave, clean hand take food outta there. hoping works. 
I hate dishes Asia never lied masks working. 

Because prepared enough masks healthcare workers. 

And western authorities saying masks don’t work bu guess what? Chinese people states Calling bluff, buying supply anyways sending back China. 


And general population wore masks almost 100 percent compliance rate, hospitals weren’t even close overwhelmed. 

The west failed. Ugh!!! Finally ! Fuggin Time ! Welcome reality idiots ! Ah, forgot piece. Ibuprofen manage fever body aches. Yes. 

As un political answer give. literally read article linked oddest benefit half makeup routine, awesome. Oh. Thanks clarification. Isaac Asimov said 1980 still holds true 40 years cult ignorance United States, always been. strain anti-intellectualism constant thread winding way political cultural life, nurtured false notion democracy means 'my ignorance good knowledge.” test that? Give government inch they'll take lightyear don’t lobbyists talking need keep happy re-election. Hahaha idk many times I’ve seen people public, it’s nose strapped chin. Bunch morons.  gonna let players play testing positive? Highly unlikely. know Zeke it. week 12 season, happy would Cowboys right now? Brady Gronk got it? Think Bucks crying postpone whatever game next? guess rally fine, per logic protests safe. agree?

Can explain Whitmer protesting against? politician charge police. protesting leadership? Oh Im disagreeing. saying tomato tomahtoe.

Not.. really.. actually. Unless talking religion exsisting. debatable. dieties throw lives not.

Ive never met someone didnt like vanilla. Met tons people didnt like chocalate. Target face covering/ mask $3.99. also wear bandana/scarf even shirt/new socks cut (you tube tutorials. Stop melodramatic. sith deals absolutes tho fucking serious, people understand loved ones might actually die; guess what....they might actually die. 115K dead now, we're track 170K dead Americans fall. Well, actually, that's it. order still place, guidelines ordered followed changed. give shit.

1) Rez might hard nightmarish dystopia. People choose live there, everyone lives one room shacks running water.

2) cared living conditions, could checked asking patient living conditions. didn't

3) People right take children wherever want. hospital's job decide.

4) really cared welfare children, would checked everyone, Native mothers. 

5) There's test could given takes hours determine mother infected. used one takes days

6) protecting tribes. People also used take Native women's babies away give White families ""protect children."" based purely race disgusting

7) Native American wife literally cried reading story still crying. Tell done protect children tribe shit, she'll punch face ... lots old people usually conservative listen talk radio telling hoax mask wearers bunch weak wristed libs/millennials wearing ""mask fear."" Best luck speedy recovery , I’m day 7. symptoms now. really trust this. like Hydroxychloroquine, suspect governments world attempt tout ""the miracle"" disregarding safety issues untested vaccine, mention fact may well work all. I've completely lost confidence ability handle public health correctly, anything matter. see real data reputable medical source, that's properly peer reviewed, touch 10 foot pole. might case, relevance whether post actually breaks subreddit's second rule? hurts much see people respect act carelessly, selfishly, stupid. bought takeout two little places me, ones thai place pretty famous, little train car place, right mask usage. also great cook, mostly help support single spots. chains way get checked this? Ii came negative antibodies test got sick symtoms early March. would test called Dude... Noah first book, Jesus sequel. 10 years find disinfectant causes cancer  Imagine trusting science instead trusting Trump beautiful take vitamins? take Brazil like 4 months see surge? really funny Desantis making big deal beginning pandemic ""all cases Florida coming New York need isolate people"" dont fucking understand this. ordered masks day northern france lockdown. also started using vacation days day. thought ""uh oh. shit doesnt look good, bet already (US)."" Four days later, telling us stay home work. Im fucking highschool dropout, GED, manuel labor job... kentucky. dumbass better judgement leaders anything? Sweden made right decision lock general population cause mental health crisis 

source? japan lockdown measures resulted less suicides. Many not. case, issues ventilation systems, workers going infected areas noninfected areas.

Ideally want average nursing home worker dealing COVID+ patients all, definitely mix positive negative patients. ever worked nursing home, know many workers simply cannot relied upon consistently follow moderately complex directions. Nursing homes constantly outbreaks things like C. diff, COVID lot contagious requires care prevent spread of.

By centralizing positive patients, properly train small number workers contact, give real PPE, i.e. proper gown, N95, surgical mask it, goggles, face shield. ""90% Wuhan patients antibodies week"" States Federal far know. 

Didnt see anything states able actually enforce quarantine either. Yep. Florida currently 3k deaths 86k case. NY 85k cases 3.3k deaths. Go ask scientist first 2 last one.

The 3rd one true, whether like it/agree not.

Chocolate awesome  assholes laughing said death toll going way, way higher projected 60,000? Hellloooooooooo........ Good! might impact Newsom's re-election chances, right move. great thing science science allows change opinion! Kinda like buying car health insurance. Seems like waste go year use it. \*bam\* need series MRIs...I know first-hand expensive mofos are.... mom (over 60, AZ) going office one day week months found today longer required wear masks. 

Now, ever 2 people office time, wonder anyone idea risk contracting Clovis-19? says they’re spread way I’m still concerned, especially since she’s conservative said things make think she’s taking seriously should. ""if gets approval US Food Drug Administration""

""If"" reason reply. hope works too. would great! sadly true Bad bot I'll fly every seat comes hood supplies conditioned outside air, exhausts via another hose outside infected passengers can't contaminate plane. That’s point, don’t go someone told they’re sick tell they’re going suffer die, joke not. When’s last time socially acceptable laugh cancer patient met hair going fall out? Also, landlords pay property taxes bulk cities get money. OC, THANK Governor Newsom! Sanity restored. Sheesh...  criticize fuck them, can't wear properly bother. virus care cover mouth nose.  expected nothing less! It’s AC I’d imagine. Wisconsin doesn’t seem nearly bad. We’re get second lesson exponential growth.

Remember New York got worse people thought possible Day day? 

Imagine that, 5+ states time, lockdowns slow down. 

The middle end July going nightmare. good thoughts friend. difficult! dreaming? Mr. president! Yes really dint understand people bring masks let sit nose. Seems lot protestors shoppers that. ridiculous. lol 4 months late, ok. Nice try fake news liberals, gonna trick wearing mask getting Bill gates micro chip vaccine gets activated 5g towers, try trick sucker... Oh god UCF, surprised. Biggest student population state university country right? look numbers CA really steadily climbing 2-3% per day since started.  Nothing that’s done slowed things down.  They’ve shown strain New York came Italy California’s strain came China. I’m concerned California’s strain resistant countermeasures. Texas expat TN now, unfortunately. dumb be. Look numbers, anything underreported  He’s first, he’s last. Friend mine traveling parents' VA Florida car weekend! Sounds like great idea. Im immunocompromised mom trump cultists, goes packed beach everyday refuses wear mask mocks wearing one. someone staunchly pro life doesnt give flying fuck possibly infecting/killing get AZ DC? wear mask trip? wanna fucking know. bet 25% kebab houses/restaurants opened last 5 years.  Come Texas.
We plenty ICU beds according Abbott. *visits White House*? find hard believe contact tracing US sufficient enough actually determine cases originated.

Not mention people lie. Whether person got covid ""muh freedoms"" protest BLM protest, crazy think they'd lie? know 4 people IRL covid every single one says ""but havent even gone anywhere!"" original comment disrespectful bud ""itll help get closer God"" satirical way referring calling *past* 3 months “living hell”

See links posted too, mess blogs news sites this. Shouldn’t staying home? Even Australian's get one. Never say never viral loads lower. We're taking lot mitigating actions reduce spread. simple mask difference leads lower viral loads new cases. I'd characterize exactly way said. Originally thought masks help much, might actually cause people become infected would touching face more, mention PPE shortage, masks desperately needed healthcare workers. new evidence came light would beneficial public wear masks, updated Put crackpipe.

Nope. Asymptomatic presymptomatic, know unless follow week two later see people eventually developed symptoms. Testing person tell whole story useful except say ""this person needs quarantined 14 days re-tested.""

Please think becoming weaker dangerous bad stats people use try make think virus big deal. is. advice runs moderate pace. doubt many running coaches would disagree that. expect ECDC contribute? 🤷🏼‍♂️ already 20k people USA volunteered challenge trials vaccine candidates, need draft anyone case roof caved cut way hahahaha 

Florida man alive well   guess compound sentences anything complex single idea depth, perhaps internet thing isn’t you... get wrong UK we're exactly perfect situation, specifically England, we're least we're improving reopen lockdown. really hope impose sort travel ban America soon, doubt we'll anything harm brexit negotiations. Ffs. I'm actually really surprised hard hit people New York acting way. heard something like 1 3 people New York knew someone died COVID-19. *they* take seriously now, think we're doomed. Yeah, wanna come home now. party getting ugly wanna leave. They’re extremely unreliable prove immunity. There’s really point you’re risking infection going test site. order provides exclusion outdoor work recreation activities *when 6 foot distancing maintained*. bother locking 2 months? Holy fuck thought r/conservative thought I'd died went twilight zone. Calling bullshit this. antibodies detected two three months mean body forgets produce them. I'm looking article talks pneumonia deaths reported COVID. point out? forcing people wear masks equates depriving taxpayers services.

I would like see logic behind thought already know, any. it’s size large country Hmm...do know purpose chainsaw was? problem people short attention spans month got bored moved on. Group insanity anti-science bias people like politicize science use way silence critics.  Here's science you: 

There team teenagers local supermarket stand front store day long spraying disinfectant shopping carts. park sun. pointed fact sunlight kills viruses, store manager threatened me. That's brand ""science"" created. 

If policies platform strong say, need silence opposition, doctor. long **are** silencing opposition, clear conclusive evidence weak enemy American people. Ugh problem lot fields, nutrition. Anti science viewpoints conspiracy theories run rampant.   using inflation calculator, $1 2000 $2 now. 15c raise actually 30c today's money.

You’re absolutely brain dead think government going stop using tracking data pandemic over. Think I’m crazy? Look CIA’s tie Google. anti science bias actually called ""stupidity"" ""religion"". top two stubborness stemming someone either categories(usually both) refuses admit they're wrong. increase testing. Testing kot increased passed two weeks lower 3 weeks ago. Data need open eyes. Two weeks ago positivity rate 2.3%. Last week week 9%. increase testing. True, also includes Vermont Maine barely got hit Giant eagle kicks Yes chance low, chance still there. use proper precautions?  Tragic story. seems good time remind folks:

Wear mask whenever appropriate. whatever reasonably protect others, including young, old, everyone between.

You get reward, probably never meet people whose lives save. might even get ridiculed some.

But anyway. would amazing decides perform giant screen home fear catching virus, using excuse ""secret services told antifa terrorist wanted shot rally video call"" Floridian here. seen attitude hoax prevalent mindset amidst locals. definitely laidback states, people still scared go anywhere public without least carrying/wearing mask. bars re-opened two weeks ago real issue. one looks wearing masks those. surprise now, weeks since point, seeing huge spike. absolutely bars. fact, pretty sure virus probably going bar area myself. Definitely fault yea, I'm dumb that. absolutely never understood ""nerd"" ""geek"" pejorative America. **standard** nerd / geek someone actively seeks knowledge experiences cultures passionately. build things simple joy building something find ""cool"", matter hard is.

Of course may behave adequately society quite understand social cues well everyone else, often _for whatever reason America_, liking science considered shameful. intelligent considered disease. wonder Americans defund education system constantly arm police military equipment. 

Basically America anti-science damn well _proud it._ Also stealing people's property trying profit it. don’t *know* antibodies necessarily confer immunity, reliably. 

It’s good guess, data far mixed. True. Pittsburgh crushing Wolf Yeah right! Open say ahh didn’t age well  Well it’s semis, it’s every car, hundreds roads connect states, genius plan what, passengers tell traveling necessary situation?

That’s like road block all, massive waste limited resource. He’s wrong. Lol apparently! think fair blame people tricked believing something. lack education misinformation matters. I'm going shamelessly plug subreddit created /r/misinformationwatch quite ready yet. Hopefully become nonpartisan space helps stop spread misinformation serve objective source information help people break ""5G Bill Gates"" mindset. Every single time I've asked clarification, I've ignored, too.

But sub absolutely unfairly applies rules actual moderators involved they, too, answer questions.

When publicly questioned one, threatened ban. Yup. particular breed seems peaking though. Trump’s adviser Kellyanne Conway sure knows science. went best damn plastic surgeon money could buy! Anyway know went to...a New York doctor perhaps DC Beverly Hills? Ignorant savages care. state state maybe even county county basis. spaniard say: Menos mal que nos queda Portugal.  That’s great point catch filthy mouth breathing spittle talk. gotta deal dumbasses arguing day

No don't. ask leave refuse call cops trespassing/disorderly conduct.

You also record they're big asshole might get fired. ""The people dying (note all) old 1% people die this. Plus, young healthy. There's logic wearing mask. afraid, wear mask, stay home want to.""
Do people say crap understand wearing mask, you’re protecting others really yourself? Unless you’re wearing N95 mask properly fitted you, chances preventing catching covid someone high. freecum ain’t free

A respirator type mask wear everyday (N95 rated) Importance:**  antimalarial agents chloroquine (CQ) hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) proposed potential treatment COVID-19 due effect several cellular processes impact viral replication. Although 100 ongoing trials testing efficacy, CQ HCQ used widely clinical practice, exposing COVID-19 patients potentially significant cardiac adverse effects.   systematically review literature estimate risk cardiac toxicity patients receiving CQ HCQ COVID-19. Data Sources systematic search conducted May 27, 2020 Ovid EBM Reviews, Ovid Embase (1974+), Ovid Medline (1946+ including epub ahead print, in-process &amp; non-indexed citations), Scopus (1970+) Web Science (1975+) preprint servers (Medrvix ResearchSquare) manual search references lists. Study Selection Studies included COVID-19 patients treated CQ HCQ, without azithromycin, included follows: (1) COVID-19 patient population, (2) study included 10 patients receiving either one medications, (3) reported electrocardiographic changes and/or cardiac arrhythmias.  Extraction Synthesis:**  characteristics endpoints incidence extracted. Due low incidence torsades de pointes (TdP) endpoints (rare events), arcsine transformation used obtain pooled estimate different incidences using random-effects meta-analysis. Meta-regression analyses used assess whether incidence different endpoints significantly varied multiple study-level variables specified priori.  Outcomes Measures:**  Incidence of: (1) change QTc value baseline ≥ 60 ms, (2) QTc ≥ 500 ms, (3) composite endpoint 1 2, (4) TdP arrhythmia ventricular tachycardia (VT) cardiac arrest, (5) discontinuation treatment due drug-induced QT prolongation arrhythmias.   total 19 studies total 5652 patients included. included studies high methodological quality terms exposure ascertainment outcome assessment. Among 2719 patients treated CQ HCQ, two episodes TdP reported;  pooled incidence TdP arrhythmia VT cardiac arrest 3 per 1000, 95% CI (0-21), I2=96%, 18 studies 3725 patients. Among 13 studies 4334 patients, pooled incidence discontinuation CQ HCQ due prolonged QTc arrhythmias 5%, 95% CI (1-11),  I2=98%. pooled incidence change QTc baseline ≥ 60 ms  7%, 95% CI (3-14), I2=94% (12 studies 2008 patients). pooled  incidence QTc ≥ 500 ms 6%, 95% CI (2-12), I2=95% (16 studies  2317 patients). Among 11 studies 3127 patients, pooled incidence change QTc baseline ≥ 60 ms QTc ≥ 500 ms 9%, 95% CI (3-17), I2=97%. Mean/median age, coronary artery disease, hypertension, diabetes, concomitant QT prolonging medications, ICU care, severity illness study populations explained  between-studies heterogeneity.  Relevance:**  COVID-19 patients CQ HCQ associated significant risk drug-induced QT prolongation, harbinger drug-induced TdP/VT cardiac arrest. CQ/HCQ use resulted relatively higher incidence TdP compared drugs withdrawn market particular adverse effect. Therefore, agents used context randomized clinical trials, patients low risk drug-induced QT prolongation, adequate safety monitoring. problem. Florida joyfully embraces reopening everything comes it. Yah good luck enforcing this...to many freedom fighters dare give right wear mask It’s called failed public school working successfully Cleveland, live confirm. Sorry find way, dream? company like too. beginning SIP impression would two week ordeal.

They would make comments time getting back office. 

If work office setting you’ve seen CDC/BOMA guidelines/recommendations, know many companies make effort abide them. absolutely ludicrous (in opinion). time, money/resources, inconvenient... Many companies won’t bothered implement changes keep employees safe, employees get tired following implemented. 

Even every day places (grocery stores instance) people can’t follow rules. Aisles becoming one ways? one pays attention that. It’s inconvenience requires much work people. Austin mandatory masks August 15 I'm Massachusetts peak whole month lockdown went effect. positive number COVID-19 cases peaked around April 25th 28th started come down. lockdown went effect late March. think there's real terrifying possibility Texas Florida worse northeast unless something *now*. Yup. wife planning trying first child around March decided everything crazy want possibility adding strain medical system. hospitals overrun, least are, we've decided say (literally) fuck get lives.

I'm still gonna wear mask go grocery store. I'm still gonna stand 6 feet behind line retailer. we're trying child, we've booked vacation summer, etc. interest spending year life going outside every two weeks stock supplies. Save Florida Man!  isn’t one, you’re jerk. penalty. Grocery stores request people wear masks kick refusing. Exactly. lot models assume virus exponential, basically suggests people equally likely get virus transmit number people. people can’t get sick it, people can’t spread it, others “super spreaders”. Also, learning it’s rare become reinfected you’re truly asymptomatic likely can’t pass along someone else. things actually true, herd immunity could come much faster models predicted. Good luck Orange County... Man, would make life changing move sort shit happen. dont go anywhere without mask, stores arent limiting amount people, people dont wear masks store. 😷 Yeah I’m pissed time. know now. know look like. saw Wuhan. saw Italy. saw NYC. saw New England Europe. People either idiots selfish, either way makes damn angry people. know, replying carnagekos said would fine year. kinda parts country Oh come little bite. People don’t turn zombies. Behold, newest innovation economic theory: Consumption-free economics! businesses eliminated due government forcing shelter place even cases fully control, model corporate greed- goods consume! fun! proof reason. Florida open whole time genuinely cannot even fathom government cares people point I'm genuinely sure process this.

I'm really glad many countries care deeply communities.

I wish this.  testing more, sweety. 


The percent positive CA basically unchanged last couple months:  food may contaminated, everything touch air around still be, like anywhere else. personally seen issues fast food restaurants though. seem taking serious many precautions limit contact customers drive-thru. Good step. needs enforced properly. keep saying every time someone comes theory: live Michigan, 80-90 degrees, humid, pretty consistently since Memorial Day. Presumably applies Ohio. that's stay-inside-with-AC weather, know is. saying thousands people protesting direct relationship increasing number seeing infections?

Pretty sure sarcasm! least still blame...Chi-Nuh! frustrating different experience. live CT went Manhattan last weekend even walking street, people wearing masks. would hate see us become complacent cases going down. know shop owners kick customers don’t wear mask, that’s start. 

However, businesses customers can’t wear mask definition- restaurants bars come mind. happy see reopening plan stipulations outdoor dining maintaining distance patrons within restaurants. course, we’ll see people follow rules, it’s reopening plan that’s problematic.

It's going get much worse health care waivers expiring we're see million dollar hospital bills much frequently. yeah, guess people calling report people wearing masks sent social workers enforce it? However scientific journal identified news article, certainly easily wish worldometer would get rid mini countries, skew results.

Let guess - 2 weeks? 3 weeks? I've read 5% people wash hands correctly using restroom. *Florida man entered chat* state well documented disenfranchising people eligible vote. masks politicized.

Worth noting, interesting trend Ohio hard-hit places still showing increases continues. new outbreak concentrated Dayton/Cincinnati area, largely spared March April wave.

The Cleveland area, hit hard initial wave, still declining. pattern I’ve seen many watching continues, areas hard hit first go around still decline, even policy compliance differences depends science fits political social narratives not. people consider facts scientific data inconvenience align beliefs perceptions. Many seniors, cornerstone GOP voters I’m afraid. Y’all trouble.  Didnt say dont want die want meet God death? want natural death death coronavirus dont fly. You’re talking total number confirmed cases. 

The people responding talking percent tests come back positive. LOL drove via Indiana realize driven got Pennsylvania. never gonna happen. fine staying home, I’m someone complete trainwreck mental health wise confirm there’s coping strategies help.

What I’m fine economy (AKA main factor determines whether people’s lives good bad) burned ground quarantine vaccine.

Sure it’ll get job done, use big gun smaller one would work fine? ridiculous headline three months in. know anything human nature humans inherently selfish.

""Coronavirus anxiety hurt ego, way justify mocking people remind three months ago. matter whether current caution justified."" wish would Manitoba. seeing 0 new cases 6 days time fore last weekend 2 yesterday 2 today. Two yesterday, can't trace got community spread. 

No people hospital ICU covid. article good example present data. 

Notice two data points presented (other nebulous realtor's sentiment)

1. SEARCHES realtor.com 10% suburban homes
2. contract Manhattan apartments 

There evidence SALES millenials ones driving search, yet draws unwarranted conclusion millenials fleeing suburbs. 

This might true, data telling us case. 

Could well real estate speculators looking snatch suburban homes cheaper favorable market invest real estate (rates good). Could investors predict desirability suburbs months come. Could also older (at risk) generations ones looking, perhaps want move condos perhaps worried value dollar next handful years buying home rent stock market crashes they're left nothing. Different story death rates. Someone's reporting figures! So, guess ""wait two weeks"" finally happened? understand outrage ton elder care deaths, one seems provide alternatives. Keep hospital? Who's paying caring them? Everyone considers patients returned nursing homes. workers likely exposed outside care facility brought in? easier blame governor Levine. like gif ducks leaving shed winter snow going ""Oh fuck, let's go back inside"". That's going 2020 rest year sports everything general. morning talkshow Rochester, NY called Kimberly Beck. absolutely terrible people disagreed literally everything ever said.

""Sorry, seen coming."" That's going end costing us floating people hibernation period would have. Woo hoo! minute soon, woo hoo! Yes, hit capacity, despite hospital officials admit, absolutely make life death decisions taken vent, etc. think people died New York would have, stressing hospitals. (at point seems WHEN, IF) AZ FL stresses hospitals, going see sharp increase death short period time. still dealing GIANT population people even believe virus exists fucking bacteria. would wear mask virus? even debate people. Yes ultimately important long run? Lives economy?

The economy directly translates lives. Unemployment poverty direct human life cost. either or. Economy lives.

&amp;nbsp;

So money vs lives comparing, lives vs lives. question getting right balance lose least possible amount lives. much focus economy much focus virus either one bailout went big companies need first place. We've cheated either way. 

The companies got LOAN, got money. companies got 1 months expenses per company, got half month. People say said people understand actual numbers economics. problem emotional reasoning. folks basing judgement feels instead reals position ignorance reasonably expected outcome ignorance.

Most people, example, know Apple currently hundred billion dollars debt case.

&amp;nbsp;

The goal give enough give companies people ability scrape could get economy rolling again. Everybody lost here. winners. Agree, saw someone ask would quarantined 30 years cause vaccine probably coming anytime soon people saying maybe point dont lose much vast majority already retired. I'm saying personally think makes okay doubt policy makers taking account. fact, people net losses government cases thanks things like SSI Medicare taxable income. Yes, great point too! act like staying home sort prison sentence. entertainment? tons streaming services. Isolated friends loved ones? There's Zoom. Doctors using tele-medicine see patients. people mental health issues, easily schedule appt remotely. 

Nobody said would easy, consider lucky live connected society internet. absolutely doable people want lockdowns mostly selfish reasons wanting sacrifice part life pandemic.  wish early they'd said ""face coverings help slow transmission please wear one, make one home leave medical masks frontline workers"" similar. Hell, tie spare t-shirt around face.

I agree, experts know effectiveness tshirts medical mask back February? scientific study late use cloth masks, many homemade,(1,2) become widely prevalent response 2019–2020 SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, virus transmitted via respiratory droplets.(3−6) use masks also anticipated response public face future pandemics related respiratory tract. **However, limited data available today performance common cloth materials used cloth masks,(7−12) particularly filtration efficiencies function different aerosol sizes ranging ∼10 nm ∼10 μm scale sizes.** also current significance relative effectiveness different droplet sizes transmitting SARS-CoV-2 virus clear, understanding filtration response across large bracketed size distribution therefore important.(13−16) **In paper, report results experiments measure filtration efficiencies number common fabrics** ... - hate may right. 

New York try best months bring cases see here, change two weeks. Two weeks!

I'm concerned New Yorks subway system fall winter. Cuomo/DeBlasio hard decisions make whether somehow open windows subway cars dead winter. needs happen, it? Sorry, didnt mean imply US developed country. main point developed pretty arbitrary term. use 0.8 HDI threshold, Qatar, Bahrain, Chile, Kuwait, Singapore, USA, Spain, Belarus, Sweden ""developed"" Yeah, totally missed it, I’m bit slow uptake today guess. protests fine though, right? virus ceases spread wokeness massive daily gatherings crosses certain threshold.

And give ""protesters wore masks"" BS saw cherry picked images people wearing them. even (they didn't) moot point social distancing thrown wind Wear mask people!!! area state in?

And everyone thankfully good. took chin, feeling much better healthy Gotcha, thanks much convinced it’s sort hoax 

How? country even biggest idiots mainly think flu. Americans always thinking everything hoax conspiracy? someone lives LA County works OC, good news.

I get work home occasionally due nature job, hopefully I'll start seeing co-workers wear masks. I'd say half work lab actually wore past months.

Thanks Newsom, take guns. fuck!? I’m fighter means would’ve turned around knocked fucker down. fun killing fucking wife. Pregnancy huge risk factor, obviously you’re selfish care anything besides yourself. Keep saying it’s totally be, sure... Going vacation kids middle pandemic lmao, fool. Honest question: anyone regularly contributes sub actually go world? Pretty sure not... said ""USB crystals"".... I'm even sure is...🤣🤣🤣 he/she legit believer. remember right, saw Trump mentioning something opening EU areas contained virus unknown point.  Meh, watch Friendly Athiest's video Seth Andrews' video number content creators went ""... to."" 


And yes, price gouging usury much taught Catholic teachings well Protestant teachings; however,don't forget charlatan snake oil salesman wears many cloths televangelist selling healing oils, monkey selling special tears, Australian selling people Kentucky idea 'this bigger Disney.' Yep! wonder this. father stage IV esophageal cancer can’t even fucking go home visit weekend Father’s Day (in GA) I’ll put mandatory two week quarantine allowed start work time. sacrifices seem insurmountable, especially cool 300k student loan debt. People need realize, world center around them. Ever.

The virus give shit they're tired it. they're tired it, what's necessary eradicate quickly possible. Otherwise, shut fuck up. give every protection necessary. He's dumb understand supporters dying cost votes though. Thing is, employees paid enough willing enforce it. duh. place science flourishes America’s military. April May going happen now. nearly amount testing happening time last month. we're reporting nearly triple daily cases. 

It really nothing test availability considering testing increased past month. actually opposite, though. defending anti-science viewpoints, appealing logic scientific fact. Sounds like Los Angeles county, minus movie theaters. restaurants dine-in half capacity barber nail salons open. deaths hit 3000 today (I know, 2nd biggest county US, still... disheartening...) tested positive =/= ill think even really cheap face coverings make difference, businesses available free. 
I also think political leadership facilitating making free masks available really super emphasizing people _need_ wear masks.  would help people understood personal freedom spread disease others. Trump campaign announces new rally Villages. 

Here’s something. It’s exactly looking number manipulation get considered eating gu, maybe that's coyoteka's secret EVERY RUN THRESHOLD PACE. tried 18 mile long runs lactate threshold pace like coyoteka suggesting, surprisingly slowed 45 minutes stop 60 minutes. Wish would share secret change fundamental biochemistry could keep 90+ minutes! LOL great juxtaposed KSL **The new numbers indicate 3.2% increase positive cases since Wednesday.** 282,685 tests conducted Utah far, 5.6% positive COVID-19. 3,993 tests conducted Wednesday Thursday, according health department.

KSL best obfuscate positive rate even misleads reader first stating 3.2% increase positive results yesterday. read couple times recognize they're talking infection growth rate, increase positive results one day another. course, include total infection rate kind useless that's cumulative number (even though think number increased solid percentage point month).

Does anyone know infection growth rate month June? seeing solid trends month. know influenced whichever nation giving donations? US gives money report ""accurate"" numbers China, China's numbers go up. China donates money report ""accurate"" US numbers, go up. Russia tells board report ""accurately"" suffer unfortunate accidents, numbers go depending ""Who's"" involved. kind disappeared. There’s theory figured treat pneumonia better, another says evolved less deadly. ended infecting ~1/3 world, too. sheriff already said wouldn’t enforce Holy mackerel headline misleading. wish cancel culture would focus bad science remove scourge. antibodies viruses usually stay human body long period time? don’t understand can’t use valve masks people don’t heat (therefore messing keep longer ) put surgical mask basically everyone wears anyway??? Doesn’t make sense ?

That way still get protection, valve issue won’t complained about. Bad wording, sorry. Someone else probably say trying say better. 2 people turn 4 people 8 people 16 people 32 people, going start seeing significant uptick cases several generations spread. going shithole long time. don’t think part constitution applies mandatory mask wearing, think brought founding fathers (after getting speed viruses work) would asked wearing mask could possibly substantial threat liberty. Unlike actually took logic college. Logical fallacy's way disqualify facts. I'm showing qualified opinions support argument.

When get college, they're going make write papers. papers thoroughly sourced cited undergraduates qualified source knowledge anything. think every time cite source, professor going dock appealing authority?

Its logical fallacy defer experts topics know little about. entire basis undergraduate studies learn find best sources information rely them.

I really care qualifications are, unless Pulitzer teach Harvard, position dispute best minds country say topic. necessary step stay fuck home someone make feel less crazy concerned wedding I’m supposed end summer? 150-200 people, south, guests 8+ states, masks, additional festivities week.

Also effectiveness (or not) cotton tshirts medical mask well known right? scientific study late use cloth masks, many homemade,(1,2) become widely prevalent response 2019–2020 SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, virus transmitted via respiratory droplets.(3−6) use masks also anticipated response public face future pandemics related respiratory tract. **However, limited data available today performance common cloth materials used cloth masks,(7−12) particularly filtration efficiencies function different aerosol sizes ranging ∼10 nm ∼10 μm scale sizes.** also current significance relative effectiveness different droplet sizes transmitting SARS-CoV-2 virus clear, understanding filtration response across large bracketed size distribution therefore important.(13−16) paper, report results experiments measure filtration efficiencies number common fabrics, ... - I'm seeing 14.3 per 100k LA county vs 11 per 100k OC. reading chart incorrectly?

I also notice Orange County's trend-line steady march up, that's fun. Ohio's data reporting great, even early on, releasing data pinpointing outbreaks zip code!

Unfortunately, area near Cleveland first victim, still seeing cases decrease steadily even questionable best mask usage, things still look good, even packed bars restaurants.

Edit: good news is, thanks collect report data, response COVID personalized area going forward instead blanket orders. neighborhoods NYC, something like 60%; city whole, think 25% that's figure April. likely bit higher now. whole, state nowhere near herd immunity, places like Brooklyn Queens extremely hard hit, virus never rip many people first wave. think he/she meant don’t blindly believe experts without using logic scientific facts well. experts, doesn’t automatically make right.  large portion young asymptomatic people still showing signs permanent organ damage, including lungs kidneys. know 24 year old previously healthy female kidney dialysis (they say permanently) covid infection March made feel sick days. One favorite docs. always great lens help understand. pretty large decrease daily deaths Perfect example.

* vaccine rushed starts causing horrible health issues year later, protests ""US medical research making flawed vaccines! MILLIONS DEAD""

* vaccine follows normal LONG testing phases becomes successful protests ""US medical research needlessly wasted time already knowing vaccine working whole year ago; 200,000 ALREADY DIED!


Praising harmful vaccine happens protect Coronavirus like saying destroying Sun successfully end global warming..... Sure.... Technically works..... *but....*

Dewine Acton shut things pretty well beginning. know people listening virus became politicized. Also, started opening couple weeks ago places. think local theater opening. ‘lo surprised continue see decrease cases. 

I hope family better. haven’t freedoms! Okay. 

You go without mask, long don’t breathe mouth, nose, eyes, ears, anus. 

That solve problem. Seatbelt laws protect others driving 

I would love hear arrived brilliant conclusion main issue see right beginning CDC, WHO, pretty much everyone “in know” stated clearly masks work buy them. beginning non-compliance. Unfortunately people long memories tack piece advice new recommendations. damage done. thanks nothing newsom, guess get participation trophy trying? started strong, lost willpower muh economy, army complaining karens chads, paying absurd state pensions salaries important following plan presented. 

i don’t think second corrupt OC sheriffs department enforce already went record saying wouldn’t enforce mask use. guess officially cross ""virus disappear weather warms up"" theory. I'm saying money used towards issue, realize terrible use hospital resources would provide long term elder care? Keeping elderly hospital setting could exposed unnecessarily knows what? Great idea too. Certainly makeshift facilities could set deal this, would likely lead whole bunch deaths facility instead.

Maybe many elder care facilities complete crap people throw loves ones die, mess either, one wants pay quality care. agree - never understand people. live north OC see people wearing masks even order. happy see order. algorithm large enough start see massive infection once. 

algorithm? Mandate masks!!!! like it... tough luck! come you?

I think anyone knows certain things reopening fall term. think go either way.

But US decides close again... might potentially moving failed state food shortages, collapsed health care system, etc.

I still cannot find disinfectant cleaning supplies local grocery stores. ran months ago. get inadequate shipments, grocery stores limit purchase still run within two hours.

I see things like improving since we've started reopening I'm compete restaurants disinfectants. Yes, UBI. Please outlay that’s gonna play out. Easy solution - protect nursing homes. that’s finally policy makes sense. bunch absolutely way out. Look daily deaths instead panic porn headlines cases asking:

""why need wear mask? I'm responsible social distance I'm indoors, outdoors"".


It's morons don't.


That's laws. speed limit? morons drive irresponsibly. can't legally bear? idiot got eaten ruined everyone.


Wear mask. adult. handle it. Ground glass opacities least one lung 66% asymptomatic cases. ridiculous. parents 95 yo grandma live San Diego. Wearing mask easy do. NYC contact tracers explicitly told ask people contacted attended BLM related protests Lol Facebook feed flipping (I’m CA) Newsom’s mask order. Someone posted petition recall called dictator 🙄 God forbid anything might benefit us around us. 

I’m curious see CA enforce actually happens (and that’s big I’m expecting major backlash), I’m happy it. It’s big deal suck don’t want wear mask, stay home 🤷‍♀️ #Roll Tide

My friends live New York certainly acting like pandemic over.

New York hit hard. one point 11k cases day. 1k deaths day.

What's also good news support Swedish strategy falling within Sweden. couple weeks ago still bizaarely high. rising death toll treated like ""Europe's leper colony"" (in words one Swedish writer) *finally* put big dent public support disastrous herd immnuity strategy pursued international, European Nordic consensus. Except context comment replied different. Read post right word ""feign"". ""Fain"" means something different changes meaning sentence. Tell they’re fucking idiots Well, Cuomo wanted 40k ventilations despite White House experts telling didn’t need them. States unreasonable requests. 

Cuomo wrong, wasted time effort chasing 40k ventilators instead protecting nursing homes. Result: deaths state. Pretty sure current one does. He’s typical pope. san antonioan here, mind sharing list? Buuuuuut Florida loves big orange New York man

It’s reduction exposure.

Sweden even giving basic treatment elderly travesty, think easily argued best way protect vulnerable populations public health measures prevent virus spreading general population.

I still get sarcastic even angry comments wearing one - strangers, coworkers, managers.

Sometimes older people might one shopping usually one else.

I feel insane every time leave house 0

No selled kick like final boss is. Absolutely true! disagree thing said.

However, change fact question, earthdc know Ms. Strozier ""healthy people"" stated? could find information article health condition time contracting Covid. live NYC.

Many people taking coronavirus seriously wearing masks diligently. BUT, still tons people acting like completely over. first image article everyone hanging outside bars, masks around necks, common sight me.

NYC vigilant states, large contingency people think coronavirus over. woman article about, don’t know I’m downvoted, it’s terrible it’s truth rare get shingles twice. vaccine keep immunity unlikely get all. would venture guess number people actually condition that, fact, limits ability wear mask compared number people simply claim condition small.

In interview SVT's Agenda, Prime Minister Stefan Löfven defended Swedish corona strategy met strong criticism opposition. said Sweden worst statistics Europe - really true? SVT News taken closer look figures behind statements made.

*“It's Sweden worst statistics. cannot spend week, map, say like this. show picture moment, ""Stefan Löfven said.*

Sweden average 60 new cases covid-19 per 100,000 inhabitants past week. highest among European countries, according compilation ECDC infection protection authority. Sweden highest last week, last four weeks.

Testing increased substantially Sweden, still relatively low compared several European countries, [according compilation world data]( also see, died covid, died with. Here, countries report differently,” Stefan Löfven said.*

The ECDC made recommendation, overview different countries Europe register cases. must taken account comparing infected deceased different countries.

However, measurement methods similar Nordic countries. statistics show laboratory confirmed cases people died covid-19 included, mainly died within 30 days diagnosis. 

Sweden Norway also include cases reported doctors. Denmark Norway also include cases Cause Death Register. Sweden, cases Cause Death Register registered National Board Health Welfare included statistics Public Health Authority. 

*""Sweden death toll normal time year""* 

Excess mortality good complement statistics registered infected deceased. Sweden's death toll began rise end March fall beginning May. Today, almost back normal levels, according Statistics Sweden.

At time, many countries Europe today difference mortality lower levels mortality compared normal, according official statistics 24 European countries compiled Euromomo. Sweden one countries still excess mortality.

The highest excess mortality rate corona virus broke Europe seen Spain, United Kingdom, Belgium, Netherlands Italy. think Floridians scared? think New Yorkers took seriously. I’m talking people know, I’m talking massive street parties. government subsidizes labor costs already. 

Just another good reason UBI. necessarily. Vaccinations designed produce sufficient immune response. hit miss natural infection. asked human bot something statistics (also simple fuck) got safe average response : idea Freeeeedddduuuum! Jesus Christ that's awful. person business counselor. I'm sorry experienced that. catch first time. guess 22 manager's number. 21 maybe would stayed open. Alot small businesses city begun shutter. Alot resturaunts permeantly closed alot small retail stores closed well. rioting looting occured beginning month help either. 

It's really sad watch really vibrant bustling street city go completely dark boarded everything Reopened May. asianmasculinity lol could least mandate masks indoors. maybe could keep state open. know thinks rising number cases hospitalizations going solve itself. Yes, official figures, excess mortality scary. may unrelated statistical anomaly may indicate fatalities reason end covid-19 statistics. accurate cause-of-death statistics epidemic difficult (and possibly waste resources), hence reference Euromomo.

The excess mortality hospitalization statistics best guides actual severity epidemic have. Euromomo shows countries far worse official statistics show (a lot worse Sweden), also makes difference Sweden rest nordic countries extremely visible.

It really problem Swedish strategy still lauded highly effective, obviously perform well compared immediate neighboring countries. still time change strategy get epidemic control. sooner, better. Looking number recovered individuals still complications even permanent damage, irresponsible keep strategy mitigation, rather containment. Sweden may facing serious long-term public health crisis this. golden rule: **Do open anything sure everything control.** new infections pop up, must able trace quarantine them.

Do rubbish ""Well, already good amount lockdown, would nice open things again."" No! Virus captures back space give it!

You must fight properly. random dicking. attitude regarding virus must ""And staying down.""

When making decisions regarding coronavirus situation, imagine virus around table decision makers. virus would say ""Sounds good."" making wrong decisions. Please avoid reposting information. Thanks. know get voted good needs happen. mortgages evictions also poor working conditions, wages, healthcare. Sadly not. UK asymptomatic cases around 70%-80% cases last weeks. way contain something can't see. Social distancing help slow spread that's it.

JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (WFLA/WJXT) – Jacksonville woman 15 friends tested positive coronavirus dinner restaurant Jacksonville, Florida.

Erika Crisp said she’s sick since night out.

The healthcare worker said stuck inside months pandemic, friends decided dinner Lynch’s Irish Pub June 6.

After dinner, Crisp said friends later tested positive virus.

Now, said state’s reopening happened soon.

“We careless went public place have, weren’t wearing masks,” Crisp said.

Seven employees restaurant also COVID-19.

The general manager shut voluntarily last weekend deep cleaning. Yeah, moment opens mouth, you’d know immediately even sneaking around behind you.

Doubt state would good high poverty bad healthcare system. I’ll take advantage shorter lines, one fewer person touching stuff ability bag way want. everything money. careful enough, imo. NY begins Phase 2 reopening Monday. shocker... Denmark relatively back normal. started reopening healthcare back normal levels already April. [their hardest hit hospital corona additional strain. 

With 0-4 dying day since early May, clear strain Danish health care minimal compared what's going Sweden. evne figure sad truth Swedish healthcare workers almost certainly risk burnout PTSD due they've last months. 1/4 HCWs worked COVID patients Norway showed signs PTSD barely deaths. problem probably much worse Sweden. basically yesterday got rid kings, mind-blowing people think world immutable. Grow little i'm jewish, interest people make decisions like that. 

as non religious example, i'm mask life, social distance, shit right family member got covid i'd hit highway house, things important. That's utter nonsense. make reality 2 variables lol. positions 2 mention. proven effective proven ineffective. know. Saying HCQ work simply false statement.

Actually would look research HCQ better results Remdesivir Remdesivir endorsed HCQ demonized. Looks like people prefer dead people guy like president. that's prerogative

If couple airlines require masks, get larger share customers, othere follow suit Well hope one gets sick household  Hot, wet, full douche bags New Yorkers endured months hell total isolation, largely following guidelines (including mask wearing) crushing curve. Op Ed Writer fuck off. Found yesterday college giving us option learn remotely fall, gladly taking. 2 people per room, dining likely grab go, classrooms normally hold 15-20 people able hold 4-5 proper distancing. spring semester doesn’t start February 1, hopefully vaccine get back normal 7 staff infected. Let's go party fog disease.  CCP lying. obscuring data true Covid19 epidemic since day one . Tedros fool unqualified. making propaganda throw shit west part cyber warfare.
The truth CCP xi Peng criminals war. China/South Korea/Singapore apps running February. 

Meanwhile, 4 months later, West still fucking around. cdc says 1/3 symptoms presumably 10 Obviously dont understand mask protecting others you. Thats stating. false sense security think protects others. whole point reduce transmission filter block. Anyway anyone jumps insults someone adding valid point child. Education key ""the know"" Forest, lakes, rivers, ten - fifteen minutes. Eastern Ohio Western PA close camping rivers thing.  


Mountains - couple hours Appalachian. SE Ohio considered Appalachia. West Virginia little hour. 5 hour drive Smoky Mountains. 


Beach - far hell. laying beach, surfing, ocean jam, going need fly drive long way. Isn’t also case countries? many news crowd infection slaughter houses meat factories US Germany. Strange it’s news focus reports came out. heartbreaking. Right. saying media reported way, remembers happening. could lying intentionally could honestly remembered differently. lot cops kept yelling ""I can't breathe"" clearly kneel her. likely reflex statement part. i'm sure go totally public, 15 people saying got corona dinner bound attract attention locally PA, masks mandatory grocery stores, markets pharmacies.  gf got told landlord upping rent 1050 month (month month basis) 1850 wants annual contract. pretty obvious trying kick redo apartment anything fight it?

I cant believe landlord would try pandemic eviction court imagine tenants favor rn.

This Philadelphia btw. I'm big fan explore esoteric areas others pull good interview. many people terrible interviewers. 

Personally, can't fucking stand pomp self important feeling Letterman show Netflix interviews interesting they've begun pretense hero worship. great interview one forgot they're interviewed sounds like free wheeling conversation interviewee stake they're enjoying it.

Joe Rogan good ""What like?"" Line questioning gets people headspace feeling minutia moments, roles, creative sparks, etc. made well known first place.

That said, really needs STFU masks. I'm NJ best governor country mandatory masks even UE feel employer creating unsafe conditions policy. And, surprise surprise, we're neck neck NY terms crushing virus numbers. 

Mandatory masks, me, number one reason that. company wraps holiday/vacation/sick time one package. get set amount days every year. I'm going break dude. excerpt:

The two stretches DNA implicated harboring risks severe COVID-19 known carry intriguing genes, including one determines blood type others play various roles immune system. fact, findings suggest people blood type face 50 percent greater risk needing oxygen support ventilator become infected novel coronavirus. contrast, people blood type appear 50 percent reduced risk severe COVID-19. We've learned there's limited spreading outside.

That's one many reasons lockdowns important planning implementing mitigation efforts could successful. gave us time produce masks ppe. Here’s hoping. I’m NE Virginia, we’re getting hit hard, resources deal. *need* go way protect vulnerable parts country. governor prevents mayors making mandates like that, plan wants comes top stick. Thanks! sound like pokemon talk third person:^) friend seller Etsy donation-centered store currently makes handmade reusable &amp; masks. Also, WholeFoods selling stores check well need today! I'm pretty sure earlier week showed survey results showed people following 2 weeks ago drop. sure Norway, no, going ahead Denmark. DK huge problem since currently around ~500 active known cases country. night day compared large caseload Sweden (whose case numbers can't trusted due low rate testing). Also, \*\*a lot\*\* essential workers 35 may exposed virus daily. 


Workers like me. idiots father still virtual appts VA Abq. glad hear option routine/minor health issues. Yeah, get either. live pretty fairly ubiquitous indoors well fairly common street neighborhood fairly densely populated lot pedestrians. hard people, c'mon. Question: experiencing postnasal drip (and slight congestion) roughly 2 weeks now. fever symptoms. can't tell experiencing allergies, possibly covid. took something like benadryl, relieved symptoms, would evidence allergies covid? ultimately get tested seeing anyone?

Thanks! friends social distanced makes even angrier see people behaving like idiots makes efforts useless. locked whereever view beach. Parts US are.

Because big country, despite caseload exploding quite rapidly early on, fact something happened Northeast (Boston NYC epicenters), much going elsewhere.

In sense full lockdown fired early many states was, fact, nothing going on. needed restrict traffic elsewhere.

Now Northeast getting control, reaching less connected states they're quarantine fatigue (and, perhaps, well educated compared coasts) unironically anyone link data shows age newly infected Florida? Nice, Carson Norwqlk Blvd! enjoy shrubbery hitting El Dorado Park lmk! strategey herd immunity. One ilk actually submitted article day admitted drop pretense now. link contains many examples Swedish higher ups admitting is, including Tegnell Giesecke, well article Swedish Defense Force member submitted: missed memo denialist narrative parroting well truly disproven. Virginia gyms open 30% capacity. go Y, there’s &lt;10 people time. signs cardio equipment social distancing (we like 20 treadmills 5 available time) Staff constantly wiping equipment down, especially someone used it. Masks common areas you’re working out. Many group classes held outside. fans used. Hand sanitizer everywhere. Locker rooms open showers, saunas, etc strategey herd immunity. One ilk actually submitted article day admitted drop pretense now. link contains many examples Swedish higher ups admitting is, including Tegnell Giesecke, well article Swedish Defense Force member submitted: missed memo denialist narrative parroting well truly disproven. saw study reduction deaths 1/3 ventilators, 1/5 getting oxygen. great, definitely better considering high percentage go ventilators die (between 80-90%). Source NPI fatigue higher Sweden places? Protests etc. common elsewhere, like neighbouring countries stay six feet apart, wear mask, don’t touch face wash hands use elbow napkin open door Henry Ford really ahead time Yeah, spreading slower cities states going lockdown. people acting like pandemic over, seeing spikes. reason worse right second exponential growth. Check back week see Florida doing. think anyone thought ""survive"" summer think kind hoped spread would slower summer.

Fewer people huddled buildings. Buildings receiving fresh air. Fewer people snivvling sneezing reasons. 

Generally, cold viruses spread slower summertime result factors. That's winter ""cold flu season"". several cold viruses cousins SARS-COV-2 coronaviruses. stood reason. tree fiddy Canada hasn’t listen much either Alberta Canada might see another rise soon also less population spread virus compared countries dense populations Close-fitting important, yes, enough material block airflow, point masks isn’t much absorb virus particles break jet air comes mouths noses. 

Like, keep mask clean make sure fits skin, you’re going get medical-grade protection anything medical-grade masks, even procedures involved stringent average person going perform every time go out, even production capacity make enough everyone. Yup. saw googling much 63 million doses may cost. Clearly made classic reddit mistake actually reading article :/. said mask wearing isnt overbearing tyranny. said people subreddit calling government lock keep citizens homes pain torture death save virus wanting overbearing tyranny. Wear ya damn masks people thing stops spreading. Sucks lost another good one. New Yorkers? Everyone acting like disappeared! Welcome America, 60 million people thought good idea vote silver spooned man-child wants fuck daughter bad he’s willing talk public. doubt, graduation celebrations probably show form increase pretty much everywhere world celebrated. anyone know russ Norway been? completely canceled everywhere Ah. general inquiry see vacancies, can't evict, specific inquiry see vacant unit reasons. makes bit sense. Wisconsin serious quiet first case early. Chinese guy UW realized right away got hospital. one makes sad. know cliché brains can't focus tragedy huge number deaths (like, say, 117,000) well focus one individual person learn about. really drives home young people safe think are. voted political hacks, pay health lives.

That got pinnacle karma manifestation. see public health crisis, political issue grandparents, they’re taking super seriously would shame got commenting ICU place patients go, like hits 100% that’s limit. Yes it’s ideal, we’ve lucky frontline healthcare workers aren’t infected Italy China, 20% cases HCP. Thanks learnings strategies that’s implemented, course infection % high necessary. (medical implant company) make donated intubation box/shields local hospitals MGH put request local efforts control covid infection hospitals. It’s hard imagine going back uncontrolled infection rate cost paid get point. Totally predictable. There's widespread NPI fatigue going everywhere right Sweden recommendations take mobility far baseline stricter NPIs did, makes sense Sweden would NPI fatigue. case kids really caring adhering recommendations getting sick. Factors would important sure one could share findings factors. Right there's much info clear usability. think 1m probably reasonably solid, 5m rock solid.

Still, ideally compare kind kind, comparing Sweden USA sound, comparing Sweden New Jersey Pennsylvania is. responsible sacked. Mynd you, møøse bites Kan pretti nasti... people shout ‘high tech cure’ conspiracy inject nanotechnology. 

There’s making people happy. Hopefully compare pneumonia illness. clear virus directly vs lack oxygen. Yeah wrong. article states doses stockpile donated, bought government. shortfall windfall stockpiling drug. much stockpile compared much used since drug longer approved covid treatment. Since donation, government likely isn’t legally allowed sell it. give away. find population could use drug expires give them?. replying comment asking social distancing people hugging photo.

Yup, I’ve got lot fam Florida convinced it’s sort hoax it’s young people getting everyone sick.. even though almost everyday going gym, store store, restaurants, church Sunday’s. feel like it’s matter time get sick.  countries system overwhelmed otherwise many admitting people ages ok die government lied you. see still don’t know shit virus Yeah knew last part try wait 3 days everything deem safe besides frozen/cold stuff. annoying also 21 days plastic sounds terrible long possible infect someone. Herd immunity actually strategy Sweden. However, I'm surprised told is, foreign media reporting months join club Great Leader Il Sung Dead Leader Jong Il. #Translation:

Motala first country celebrating students. Two weeks later, Region Östergötland sees corona center increased among young people western Östergötland.

- see positive test responses age group 15-19 years come area around Motala. recent weeks several hospitalized patients age 18, seen way before. believe end school [year] may caused infection spread, says Rickard Lundin, regional health leader.

He also believes eased travel restrictions fine weather done thing.

Pathetic collective group supposedly world's brightest elite minds can't get right, where's others like Germany South Korea smashed app 6 weeks.

Your time would better spent lobbying businesses make shoes, shirt, mask, service. new. Nope, safety epidemic left good private enterprises. traffic rules, rules govern hygiene hospitals, etc. different. Except study didnt test anyone actually tested positive before. whole study based idea doctors probably January dont care airlines getting business ones aren't. care health safety us. live, large majority cases came airport. I'm talking thousands people. Airports crammed planes tightly packed well. sitting next crow people several hours, terrible idea require mask. Please never throw surprise gynecology party. want say Chinese people act save whole world criminals ruling china. everyone understood tech works, think everyone would embrace it! hahahahah.... hahahahaha... hope title joke... Happy Birthday! glad you’re spending without hospital bed vent.  
I turned 40 last week also need make sure start taking care heart.  
  
Sounds like taking recovery seriously. interesting see xray images recovery.

Not say virus spreading far slower predicted. see. best you. amazed Spotify thinks guy talks mostly mid level comics mma fighters work $100 million. think majority audience stoned. mean seriously. would listen many mildly interesting people 3+ hours. bar(pre covid) conversations person, I'd ninja roll 45 mins don’t always get paid time, ones often late ones want repairs done hour (I’m climate control winter summer, water time, anything else 72 hours.

Places like Ocean City Virginia Beach going hard maintain much distancing they’re really built that. times, fun. pandemic, much. never know hahaha Took parse that, too. thought newspaper weirdly informal. 3,600 new cases yesterday.

www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us/ can't upvote enough. actually donated, maybe exchange something yes donated regift people need it! interesting, sad, watch situation Gällivare develope. Local officials taking *very* seriously, implemented measures called ""lockdown"" measures. also contact national Public Health Authority [FHM] advice. Meanwhile, national experts insinuating officials Gällivare overreacting ""panicking"" implementing measures using strong language using bad situation is.

I think Gällivare making right calls here. charge Swedish town/municipality would ignore FHM entirely since terrible track record, take note worked parts Europe instead adopt those. Uh oh. song, mom's spaghetti ends sweater. can't good. I'm looking advice; I'm merely stating fact. fit profile American Obesity. also changeable. I'm pointing fact awareness within community Americans overweight. accept fat HAES, that's bullshit crazy mentality people came justify shoveling food mouths. give thumbs people wear masks, see fellow intelligent individual understands risk mitigation community collaboration. chance something like ""mini panic attacks""? instead symptoms appearing again? ton people getting hours cut. working 2 months reminds Harris teeter. Ugh. Also getting $200? haven’t heard Yes yes obviously positive test could dead cells, similar South Korea studied reported. symptoms could something else (or psychosomatic). Ok, need refresh makes good source possibly also really take look statistics actually mean.

If common sense factor would done health expert guidance. It’s difficult Texas governor saying none enforceable.

Which, sadly, makes toothless plea powerless mayor. 

Don't get wrong, need every cultural figure citizen encourage masking up. can't imagine many residents Houston start (D) mayor asked to. It’s scary unprepared scenario. Young people, outdoors, wearing masks part.  People still meeting guess even lockdown place. mind giving website get from? Mine might reliable Poland's weird. Mandatory masks month half, real drop cases, mask rule dropped. Case growth remains same. Poor young folks might get annoying cough couple days. tragic! exactly meets criteria bad?

There still case healthy young person getting sick probably common. little skepticism healthy multiple new agencies reporting getting worse get ready another wave..... think better err side caution point least 17 COVID-19 cases children reported within last week Dallas County, connection 9 separate childcare facilities. Prior last week, one childcare facility connected COVID-19 cases last two months.    
  addition cases, Dallas County Medical Examiner’s office investigating death 12-year-old child COVID-19 associated death.

3) Punish procrastinating. Punish parents. kid falling behind gets put program support. continues badly, send person school similar secondary schools today expulsion. Make place kids want end up. Make place requires cleaning, organization, discipline, etc similar military school

Online schooling embraced. would reduce costs &amp; experience something interactive going stick way ready 10year outdated book. #2 behind maine still = ton old people. esp given population state, % wise United States, **rather creating single contact tracing app**, decision support Exposure Notifications made state’s public health authority. Alabama, South Carolina, North Dakota among first U.S. states express interest Apple Google’s Exposure Notifications API assisting COVID-19 contact tracing. It’s kind like occasional anti-vaxer nurses. basically Florida shutting destroying it’s economy nothing don’t know social distance wear masks.

Great job destroying economy reason DeSantis. going let virus run rampant never closed anything all. No, get definitely lock down, I’d still rely things surrounding environment surrounding environment less safe, I’m less safe. many others position like I’m in. Alameda county strict mask law, enforced advertised. understand Texas, Arizona, Alabama, Tennesee experencing spike cases, happening California? one cares you’re asking. downvotes say all. I'm China. ccp bunch assholes. really think I'll dead tomorrow. fucking sense believe bullshit news. Yep, it’s quite telling. Unfortunately many people I’m close fall category. :/. Except far see, Florida publish ICU hospitalization stats like many states. least dashboard checked yesterday said that. 
My brother works ICU Brevard County hospital, contact several people hospitals--their word I'd go on. brother's hospital covid cases now, we'll see goes now. Absolutely shameful. supposed believe anything this? Arizona southwestern state definitely south. Texas Texas. :)  I've sounding alarm Twitter since late Jan lot ""scientists"" ""experts"" totally blind incoming pandemic. completely failed see danger even Wuhan locked down, worse, actively posted ""it's nothing"" misinformation. never assume education implies intelligence.

One scientist posted ""get flu vaccine bc flu dangerous"" Feb even today defends stance. kind people real reason behind failure today. US surgeon general said buy masks.Contrast Chinese authorities promptly classified SARS 2 class took appropriate action. think people wild stake city? make things worse everyone. Yep happened working target. get hours around Christmas, rest year coming 7-10 help close store, worst year life good riddance.

Studies shown increasing minimum wage actually increased poverty lower class. companies sort thing, people usually forego health insurance. get sick rack medical bills even worse shape end all. look CDC website. T-cell/CD4 cross reactivity theories interesting. study done blood samples taken 2015-2018. think like 34% reactivity COV-2 never exposed it. Can't remember source. got posted several times... CDC advise masks social distancing possible, example dont wear mask hiking, already distance anyone else trails. guidelines supposed mask, time non-fat risk people. Ha ha requirement? Sounds dumb so. done March. lot places acting like that. Honestly people continue take serious actually effects someone know. mUy fREeDom relative who?

asking friend. agree. ok concerned subreddit takes whole level. got people sneezing home asking they're going die. I'm like relax man lol oooh thanks fair, “bad cold” thought dying. fever went 102. much difficulty breathing put steroids clear lungs. sick bed two weeks took two months coughing subside. sucked. years ago. That’s imagine mild case covid feels like threshold hospitalization. 

As comparisons flu, cousin died pneumonia flu late 20s. structural defect heart wasn’t discovered autopsy. told probably never experienced symptoms it, could contributed death. 

That said, know dozen people tested positive experienced symptoms far mild cold Hell. also know one needed hospitalization two died. forget Texas!

I’m upstanding citizen. employeeless Walmart would steal much sleep like baby afterwards economy China super hot though. know boomers think need show job smile firm handshake? That's there. even employers lay off, still pay month that.

You also keep mind China's government would probably considered ""left wing"" western standards. investing heavily schools public infrastructure. government also extremely technocratic: every block planned bureaucracy everything. works. sharp contrast American ""privatize everything"" model lot ways.

If think I'm sucking China's dick I'm though. Read post history, I'm critical China. infuriating part. necessarily need government shut down. Japan shut down--they wear masks. Apparently reaching heavy paper mask putting face far much ask people (I say errands see people without coming stores.)

You say exact thing people supporting Swedish strategy though. trying desperately seen strategy - success failures - bit worse others terms mortality rates, bit better others terms reducing harm brought destructive measures.

There really isn’t overwhelming evidence support this. fact remains many Swedes going infected die, nowhere near herd immunity. rightfully assume sticking carrot ass work shown does, can't make mental leap pharmaceuticals? TIL: I'm human... happens AZ, governors also forbidden mask wearing came day said cities could never said no.  I'm conspiracy theorist, NM seeing back-to-back within 10 minute headlines

Well considering public transportation mode transportation 90% people big city, case emergency, would suggested do?

If saw pictures subways ghost town.

I wish rose-colored glasses wearing Come - kid once. parents say levy consequences do. Getting grounded entire summer worth fighting mask thing. 

Plus, parents kind assholes allow wear mask, they're probably also kind assholes get vengeful punishments. Well, thinking Florida Texas close competition title next epicenter. lot people complaining others following guidelines well. fucking hilarious. One month ago people arms people protested stay home order. everything okay?

ICU less affected this, capacity back April reported. put entire population bell curve, person average intelligence middle, half curve lower intelligence middle, unfortunately. Link work. probably turned Swedish girl past Nobody asking anyone stop living life.

Why going bars going movies important neighbor's life? definition living life? part slightly careful giving select activities name saving hundreds thousands peoples lives 'asking young people stop living life'?

And I'm even talking things forever. What's wrong people slightly inconvenienced months even year outrageous thing consider exchange lives? 

That's is. inconvenience. things little carefully used thousands thousands doctors/scientists working problem day night find safe way move forward. Remove “probably” biggest wallstreet trade history happen March, 2 billion 3 weeks. $1 donated, actually tweeted capital gains tax removed year economy 🤦🏻‍♂️ everyone sold every house live in, would 0 rental units. rental units, happens can’t afford downpayment even lower housing prices? 

The rental market America seems f*cked saw lived saying everyone renting property leech selfish selll also doesn’t make sense.

If everyone really sold places renting would lead huge problems across board. Want move another place? Live hotel buy house. Need move somewhere 3 months work? Live hotel buy sth need sell 3 months later. 

I honestly clue happened Americas rental market screwed calling people rent places bastards answer. Germany rents low massive percentage Germans rents doesn’t own. landlords bastards rent places (not counting Munich) often less $6 / sqm. Whatever went wrong USAs rental market systematic issue it’s issue letting people rent places.  Didn’t Thursday start??? Explain Well can’t rely federal government there’s literally shitshow federal level. take really dont like swedish strategy? one many problems begin boil lockdown forever side doesnt care about. cannot tell people cannot earn living send help. * REEEEEad more. never really cared cities myself. It’s shame much work concentrated would much like live, work raise family country.

Cities sure begin feel soulless perhaps that’s me. Mouse gonna pissed. drive hour see complete lockdown one place family 8 masks grocery shopping another.  75% local cases large families close proximity getting infected. post defended government? people keep moving goalposts provide profit housing everyone?

This tough situation right across board, saying one profit residential housing absurd.  necessarily bad thing. 

But business travel truly needed, need consider global consequences. 

Either everyone hold conferences countries least entry restrictions. Exploit countries can’t afford protect people :( know mean, I'm denying scale problem moment, publications I've read suggests going get worse Winter. mean real second wave, continued first one. wish people deny science agree it.

Except scientists agree even close it. subreddit particular listens ones agree with. I’d like see statistics heart attack deaths also prior years compared now. may lack seeking care d/t fear, know COVID also affects cardiovascular system. guess category. Teenage grandchildren world. Survived Vietnam (multiple gunfights - grenade blew right air drum mostly blind right eye), measles, rubella, mumps, tropical hemorrhagic fever, crashing ultralight, multiple sex tours, 3rd world prisons, much can't even talk about.

Sorry, COVID-19 seem serious me. election year, NFL season. Might well think like meatpackers. Instead they’ll get limitless supply Corona... cynical outlook. Policy reforms change absolutely possible, especially population back wall government shrugging shoulders. I’ve surprised elderly wearing masks Publix ect; 

We shall see nursing home / retirement community situation goes.... believe $500 cap amount WI. make that, get anything UI. make less, get tiny amount regular UI, long get anything unemployment, also get $600. Yep. Despite many would believe, landlords provide service. Many people believe price justify services performed, I'd agree (especially places like NYC San Francisco), still charity work. Landlords need rent cover mortgages, taxes, property upkeep.

Just suspending evictions without also extending mortgages suspending property taxes/utilities big load bullshit. way deliberately obtuse. 

All asking scientific evidence claim disease produce immunodeficiency syndrome like HIV. evidence, make claim.

This flu. serious, novel infectious disease killed 3 people know. bandying unsubstantiated claims like HIV help people take virus seriously. cause distrust public science communication more. death rates went 12% 8.6% patients given plasma opposed time ago, death rates without plasma? Yeah, compare Soviets lost around ~~27 *million*~~ Oops, 2 million. Comparing COVID-19 death count contextless, sensationalized ""checkpoints"" shit journalistic move. That’s simple way think terms seasons affect social behavior, winter Arizona like summer northeast.

I honestly thought everyone knew guess not. keep landlord mitigate risk.

Which I’m doing. Israel close schools due outbreaks schools. easy pick people lacking hygeine practices dont even brush teeth.

They ones refusing wear masks public cannot stand smell face. “But there’s short supply” guaranteed cause panic theft hospitals, though. 

This would probably good thing, would caused thefts, panic - think might motivated responsible people step forward take charge, instead letting default Trump's children. Time buy ape costumes learn ride horses come back Earth - that's going give surprise. Absolutes arguments cause argument self defeating.

Everyone.

I'm part ""everyone"" go public job. I'm home 24/7. Yet, somehow understand devastating virus is, understand need masks, social distancing.

I'm going unless absolutely think re-open tested vaccine cure. Even means company going economic distress family. would rather poor hungry debilitated dead.

Everyone close time highs They’ve saying months. ICU / Hospitalization rates comfortable levels right now. long hospitals prepared fine. 

Cases way up, need remember look rates hospitalization get overly concerned. It’s bad none places hot, reliable source says heat kills virus. Everyone Orlando acting like never actually pandemic.

Gonna rude awakening. hey ive trying understand struggling find specific answer. someone asymptomatically covid catch symptoms? keep see conflicting information immunity wanted see anyone clear answer Maybe younger people starting realize risk dying virus may low, risk surviving compromised state frighteningly high? Well, look information percentage younger people asymptomatic mildly symptomatic think anything it, real concern probably protestors, rather people protestors go hang 3-10 days later, going turn next wave. Faster could say ""astroturfing."" tests? trials? share data? would appreciate it! one wearing mask. good luck getting people change behavior now!  get mixed messages sleazy politicians. Certainly Desantis board. worry much end. 
As Faucci noted, distinct lack respect science country. you’re right basically - antibodies tests cautious sharing data avoid giving false securities. 

As still don’t know effects antibodies long term doesn’t tell us much future virus, past. 

There least 670,000 antibody tests UK far. recent public data suggested 17% London 5% nationwide, fairly date likely far higher current moment. thread discusses some-  article, Costco resume free food samples target accept returns. I'm sure Costco probably eliminate masks 

I guess defeated virus yeah!!!! Huge fireworks display. Even friend isn’t nurse works health facility gets tons free. Explain that. Would feature rich this: pretty robust configurable. Plus many sites scrape data, it’s using sources including John Hopkins since seem common valued data source. Nobody could seen coming.... quote never gets old. Jack's lack surprise. appreciate willingness float suggestion there, please accept correct move on.  Landlords would rather cut rent 20% tenant pays deal tenant pay 6 months row. I'm already seeing pretty decent price drop around apartments. 2BR units used go $1400+ $1100-$1200. he'd rather score cheap political points base actually work keep constituency alive Coronavirus nodding approvingly... also use reusable cotton mask room filter. picked Toolbox brand blue shop towels insert there. retrospect, think stepped gone public. 

The result complicity cost 100000 American lives, lent illusion credibility fucking yoyos.

Anybody working with, cooperating Administration complicit, ounce integrity, fucking step immediately. Mattis waited, credibility shot. 

I hate say it, looks like probably Jon fucking Bolton integrity bunch. Except, course, Walter Shaub. He's one understood what's really going on, necessary. Alaska cruise one first stops, 40s 50s. saw HUGE range clothing, people Florida bundled parkas gloves scarves people upper Canada wearing shorts t-shirts. can’t get n95 masks.. ask friends nurses. give free, bc get multiple everyday free. buy wouldn’t ask airlines hand out. Yep, parents house Westchester we'd prepping sell. broker got inundated requests rent instead. but... said goal xD get offended rest Nordic countries want Sweden travel bubble. 

Förlåt, we'd rather skip drunk boat tourists summer, come back got crowd immunity. Honest Quesiton - cases increasing drastically deaths seem roughly flat slightly down? correlation since almost two weeks growth. deaths recorded accurately?  mean, yeah, guess people going go matter what. resident Florida, guess I'd go buy 3 months worth groceries, stack 'em garage freezer, hope best. Sucks Disneyworld employees though, especially older pre-existing condition workers. problem said including 3 small kids. Face shield might work idk could get cooperate. feel like kind lucked much they're even tolerating cloth masks. Universal Orlando’s open two weeks ... 9.6% positivity rate. good Mine went $185. Hooray Long Island  Depends state. Alaska reports total recoveries updates frequently. also graph together active cases deaths see visually. Really tends put things  1/ That's true, many people predicted ""disaster"" states like Florida countries like Sweden, woods stretch, turned medical hell feared many. 

2/ Nobody talking bragging even saying wrong decisions made (aside sending sick people retirement homes, digress). support lockdowns think AZ others absolutely stupid taking seriously others mattered. I'm talking evolving understanding virus data comes see extreme measures necessarily key driver success anymore. increasing amount data showing us manageable thought (especially account age distribution). Even US see despite increased number positives number deaths declining steadily far. outpatient facilities (that's procedure scheduled for)? think sanitation procedures would strict? Yeah, mine greedy fuck. One 80% profit nothing property owners. Oh well, extra $240 year split 4 ways beats us moving Hey Gorbi, we're talking Florida states currently surging here. Maybe stay topic? engage whataboutism: course Cuomo responsible, difference stepped mistake became apparent, reversed course started taking seriously. We're still waiting ""leaders"" that.  thing know many need. today, Texas pretty well locked hospital need 2-3 weeks, that's delay exposure hospitalization. Four hospitals Houston already hit capacity week.

Plus, avoiding infection first place far effective reducing deaths. seems like crazy gamble wit human lives based little real data.

Just reminder herd immunity work neither vaccines. funding isn’t going schools. It’s going administrators. 

So schools underfunded, aren’t funds going them. Corruption skimming top. landlord tried raise rent year moved in. afford it. trying dig way bad financial year. Plus, added expenses relocating ""furnishing"" new home (very sparsely). Tried explain situation. Ended carry rental insurance, new stricter rules pet ownership, ridiculous home ""inspections"" every 1/2 year so, well signing multiple agreements restrictions. Obviously, leave move somewhere else. issues place, explained away fault. compete that, aside filming home inch inch day sign lease defense blame something you. I'm new home. supposed know nuances cracks issues new home arrived. They're make money, period.

I really hope WFH becomes permanent fixture. actually great country local communities. west lack luster distancing measures “errrrg make wear mask!” Attitude stops ripping through.

The European countries NY saw curve flatten virus spread much could think. around 30% infected.

I don’t think NY’s great numbers compared Cali due superior adherence distancing, think it’s purely much nearer herd immunity. Spain, UK, Italy, etc used exponential growth obscures differences valuable see linear graph pronounces growth rate. Oh let's get real here, herd immunity ever really goal, they'd go around inject pre-selected healthy individuals live virus, i.e. using live virus vaccine.

Waiting naturally spread sorry excuse policy nothing seems cool incredibly tedious track. workers often come east Europe live small hostel like living quarters. workers basically live one building sometimes 8 people one small room.
This official explanation spikes meat industry Wow idea endoscopies without sedation. seems terrifying lol

Mine done outpatient facility too. first thought may better hospital, started wonder possible sanitation efforts may strict...

Username doesn’t quite check out. guy idiot problem landowners many people try make profession think one dumbest things do. Many landlords understand land lords. something easy actually takes lot knowledge high level education like always every idiot thinks it. 

Can easy way make money? Yes. However, know heck doing. One important thing better know manage expenses. Ever wonder landlords increase expenses? greed many lack management skills. get idiot thinks increasing rent 100 dollars big deal fact shit asinine. Say pay 2000 rent live LA. 5% increase rent. Imagine pay 5% increase property tax? would livid! 

Not everybody educated landlord. 


Now also tenants problems greedy abusing landlord's trust. Making excuses late rent denying certain damages caused landlord's property. 

Education needed parties specifically Landlords since hold lot power situations. wholly agree everything said. think whats worse people actually shame mask wearers.

I’m sure suburban way movement think cities quickly return king passes whether it’s 6 months couple years. Ya fuckin' think? Headline Tom Wolf: CDC Says Pa. 1 3 States Coronavirus Cases Declined 42 Days He's active everywhere. coin machines reliable read give accurate count. please fees involved Okay, understand responsibility wearing mask, absolutely wear one. Period. questioning working out, Covid, boost ? dum dum cult trying make seem hazardous CO2 ? Thats question. thing Faux news / FB b.s. propaganda. Cause I’ve hearing lot lately. I'm trying put together point-buy system manage quaranteam's risk exposure wanted feedback relative risks certain kinds encounters. 


The entire team could spend arbitrary amount 1000 pts per week collectively, including encounters anyone outside pod. 


Points per person contact:

* 0’-6’: 5 pts
* 6’-30’: 1 pt
* 30’+: 0 pts

Multiplied number hours 
5x multiplier inside 
10x multiplier unmasked 
\+1 every common surface touched 


So trip grocery store allows 10 people store 1 person (less exposure fewer people go) would 1 cashier 5 pts, 4 people line 10 store 14 points, 19 points contact, go 1 hour, still 19 points, inside, that's 95 points, everyone masked still 95, interact checkout pad, that's plus 1 96.  That's almost 1/10 teams points one trip grocery store. 


A no-contact martial arts class would 10 students 6', 2 hours, inside (albeit well ventilated room open wall), masks, common surfaces 100 points. 


Seeing gardening coach would 1 person 6', 1 hour, outdoors masked, maybe 10 common surfaces (she's touching plants) 11 points. 


Can point relative risk profiles kinds exposures research? 


Thanks! r/humblebrag r/iamverysmart Valid point long term solutions, know nonsense.

The border closure approach effectively gambling two three things-

-a game changing treatment vaccine available near future.

-the economic benefit relatively unrestricted economic activity inside closed border outweighing economic cost closed border

-the additional time bought means country chance stockpile tests/ventilators/ppe, finally reopen borders better placed deal clusters. Quarantine state, nobody out.

Indecent exposure guess give people time obtain masks make arrangements absolutely refuse wear mask. people also tend freak sudden changes made. Hits keep coming find country significantly higher % infected reported cases. 3% infected implies 330k infections Wuhan. official death count Wuhan around 3900 deaths gives us quite high unreasonable IFR 1.18%. interesting. wondering spiking Wisconsin. many masks here. People meeting outside. Inside due heat may it. personally blame state low covid activity banning visitors high impact regions.

For now, enmeshed work keep busy. find therapist think prefers go one choosing. Disney isn’t going close again. Couple reasons why. 

1. Disney released guidelines couple weeks back wear mask, distance yourself, oh aint fault get sick - risk. “By visiting Walt Disney World Resort, voluntarily assume risks related exposure COVID-19” [official disney 

2. There’s already case break TRex cafe Disney Springs. Employee supposedly worked two weeks sick theres telling many people exposed. cafe open Disney Springs. [unofficial disney 

And bonus: DeSantis literally cant afford close again. state’s budget extreme shortfall due huge loss tourist dollars, tourist tax dollars, sales tax dollars, hotel tax dollars. Rumor mill (and mean rumor amongst state employees know) saying continues gets worse, creative make difference (as state cant declare bankruptcy). hearing lay even state workers, empty state retirement coffers (as declare bankruptcy fuck retirees it), increase state’s cut tax shares local city/county governments (which effect local services like road maintenance, firefighters, ems, etc). 

Floridians going stock up, bunker down, prepared. Shit get nasty. Haha, see that. guess still sure what's root. FWIW think benign explanation would they're foolish *also* foolishness became compounded pridefulness, March Folly / sunk cost fallacy, etc. 

I rule evil though. That's sure. complex opaque point.

This whole situation damn sad horrifying. Monty Python logic.

Edit: don’t know. would rather see unified strategy. Maybe stronger ECDC. Unified TTI program. Faster data exchange countries. What’s point rules week delay starts. it’s important say “wear fucking masks”? Company officials declined Arizona Republic's repeated requests confirm number employees tested positive COVID-19, saying disclose information ""protect privacy"" workers.

Another enclosed area lots gathering. eradicate it, able contain without shutting economy again, unlike every country *hasn't* eradicated it. Let guess - 20s kids?

If there's nothing supposed happen year can't hapen next year year course cool ""sacrificing one year life"".

People different ages/life stages may feel differently certain things next year year may late. live covid CANNOT mean eliminating people congregating.

It’s workable avoid gatherings, masks aren’t magic. Reducing number size gatherings going crucial part keeping virus control (at least get prevalence low level).  Even Federal Government lawful right require US Citizen place substance bodies.

States lawful right either.

______

Our feelings matter irrelevant. desires irrelevant. law.

Want change? Vote.  updates Oxford vaccine? Also shouldn’t legal law, I’d never drive without seatbelt idk became law. There’s opposition based legality. school classes started going online April, education staff made sure tell parents public [*emergency remote teaching, online teacher and/or students might never done online meetings before, might good enough hardware network speeds stream well. And, courses designed built using e-learning best-practices, taught someone well-versed technology, participants choose there. Straka conservative personality appeared Fox News. describes website former liberal encourages people leave Democratic Party.

When asked masks, Straka said anti-mask himself, sees personal decision. Along T-shirts items, Straka sells masks website.

The flight attendant said needed wear mask flight, Straka said, indicated law.

""I irritated fact even conversation. said her, 'That's actually law.'"" repost... children, shit hurts heart. wish people would take seriously. saying family didn't, still run people town refuse wear masks take proper precautions, either realize care. affecting people, families, mother's father's sons daughters etc. unfortunate happened baby got experience anything life. condolences family families affected virus, hope things improve sometime soon stop happening people. believe people actually masked keeping distance this.

We see mass outbreaks tied ReOpen protests month earlier well. Masks *and* outside works. People vastly underestimate hard Covid spread outdoors want expand long time means? It’s it’s according plan. one little mayor...  think right sub thinly veiled racism. visited Vegas 30 times life stayed strip off, say confidence off-strip far liking, especially Summerlin area. know full well locals tend avoid strip, good reason. saw decent number masks people reopening. Unfortunately it’s tapered wouldn’t surprised see small increase couple weeks. 

I feel OH really well people started thinking “reopening slowly” meant “do whatever want again”. Yea shit, probably going lead death us 405322 count ww2.
I think track Incompetence: USA, UK, Brazil, Russia, Sweden.

You forgot Mexico well. Yes, link works thanks, comparing health systems exactly article doing? Comparing NY Florida, NJ California etc? Seems like data several international countries tracks same, absurd deduce one executive order much impact making be.

Particularly consider data thus far indicates [the racial makeup nursing home biggest terms transmission, facility’s history quality care, Nursing Home Compare ratings, non-profit for-profit ownership structure, proportion Medicaid residents bearing likelihood COVID-19 infections.

This especially poignant coupled fact many NYs hardest hit nursing homes [received 100% clean bills health zero multiple DOH inspections.

Put simply, taken together - evidence indicates Governor Cuomo's March 25 Executive Order little impact transmission virus New York. virus evil enough infiltrate even best facilities zero positive patients. evil enough decimate SNFs worldwide, similar death rates all. socioeconomic makeup SNF's residents biggest factor determining transmission recovery.

Of course, really still early tell research inevitably done see what, any, responsibility Cuomo's EO SNF deaths NY.

Edit: said - agree Order, know alternatives available Cuomo time. residents deemed medically stable need hospitalized. Order also made available avenues facilities felt like could adequately treat separate resident (the State would transferred hotel take care, would appoint receiver take facility entirely). environmental changes detrimental elderly, think unnecessary prolonged hospital stays would done good either. So, alternative? sad, 100% correct. Oregon's reaction always seems delayed. finally announce masks required everyone public places, set timeline start week now. immediately? state well past 4 weeks seems control. protest bump, tons mask wearing, etc.

I glad near Az. Well that's dumb peer reviewed study antibody prevalence Wuhan. 

Unless provide scientific reasoning (other China) study wrong, suggest stop spreading misinformation. Fair enough, going quick glance post history. Apologies wrong. He's right. Again. Maybe matter perspective phrase ""giving 0.5% life COVID"", feel *more* inclined say, ""fuck this, gotta live"". 0.5% entire life nothing sneeze IMO. think adding Pneumonia spikes Corvid data could way start accusing countries states covering possible Corona Virus deaths. Deaths Pneumonia would actually going people honest Corvid.

Is anyone tracking Pneumonia way cross reference ""Pneumonia"" average cases? simple recipes homemade hand sanitizer net. making absence options. little drying though. I’d check r/teachers consult Florida teachers well. may good ideas manage class. I’m thinking many kids, best bet establish boundaries right away- might keep try keep away you. [there’s plenty indoor 

Obviously not, we’d die economy completely shut til vaccine available. Good question. analogy accurate sharks attacking certain demographic. group statistically negligible attack yeah I’m going water risk shouldn’t. Wait thought hot Florida Hurricanes would actually help many cases. Get people isolated indoors TC base? I'm little 200k TC feel like would hurt pay much 2.2k month rent.

200k base though, imagine sting bad.  Today cinemas open. live first county reached Stage 3 California. trying go back normalcy vigilant wearing masks social distancing. 2 deaths, 120 cases, 108 recovered, 10 active today. 

My son goes summer school online. able eat inside restaurants. barbers nail saloons open well \#FauciLies I'm sorry go explanations performative activists wanted online moral high ground. us seen hell medical staff went past months. respect stayed also believe wife's concern real understandable. I'm bro. Abbott garbage whole thing started. Yep, heard ""Why wearing stupid masks"" first curious lots reasons this: reliance WV's economy mining, racial demographics states, skyrocketing growth DC metro area Tenant. 😂😂😂 eating cereal day dropping dead ten years Sugars pose risk all. \#dicksoutforcovid  Yo, america. Get rid traitorous sacks evil.

Voting optional. Guys, I'm starting think scientists doctors might right masks help reduce spread COVID-19. grand mixture: also malice greed. know lot people assumed we'll vaccine end year we'll never worry again.

But pointed vaccines flu measles. ended either. Can't reach 9, 10, 11...∞ months without going 8 first. total isolation

That's insult people Wuhan, Italy, places actually endured total isolation. US/New York lockdowns largely soft best. people infected, better chance mutates something re-infect already infected COVID-19. know disappoint r/coronavirus panic porn purveyors, vaccine highly likely. hate ask here, I'm sure ask can't get ahold unemployment ask them.

I'm Wisconsin, recently started working again(very hours). I'm wondering working collecting unemployment calculated? I'm unsure find information site. 

My weekly benefit $270 them. mean earn $270 week job, longer get unemployment? based hours worked threshold? work certain amount hours unemployment benefit starts getting reduced?

I need know want surprise extra $600 per week ends working much. want watch hours work know what's going happen financially. Yeah, crazy us open we're time low, rather randomly like everyone else.. trust anecdotes hear sub. salty people without keen grasp reality. Well California anything fundamentally different places. CA reopening quickly opening non-critical businesses without masking law. would expect cases spike? like removing control rods reactor...you eventually melt even slowly another reactor. totally should! Send pm :D Im sure ""bad choice"" non mask wearers making. Here's updated chart new AZ COVID cases last 3 months (with today's data): 

- **Cases:** We've hit new highs every case chart again. Today highest number positive cases added single day. 43K+ cases state. 
- **Testing:** PCR testing couple thousand tests yesterday again! (Good!) one highest PCR testing numbers reported ever.
- **Spread:** Overall PCR positive test percentage ticked 8.9% 9.1% (based 379K tests, 6.6% low) average week 15% (based 9K cases, % last week). 
- **Hospital Utilization:** COVID Hospitalizations 5% yet (another time high). ICU beds COVID patients hit time high again. (Overal ICU usage went 83% 84%) Ventilators use COVID flat, overall vent. usage hit 40% first time. Itubations COVID patients dropped 20%. 

*Data Source: can’t find article now, also thought read cases coming back China Russia longer incubation period two weeks. could remembering wrong, I’m wonder odds mutation either making happening are. Haha Totally agree. long conversations agencies’ preparedness healthcare funding start shaming individual New Yorkers who, like said, crushed thing. I’ve never seen level discipline solidarity city. think people sometimes conflate ""Deep South"" ""South."" Texas part South, according US Census Bureau. part Confederacy considered historically Southern, well. unique culture includes attributes modern Southern states. money comes first bro !!! kinda Nazi Germany felt.
They big censoring. careful that. Everyone US right 
to peaceably assemble. apparently right burn loot businesses it. happy.
It's win win involved. Thanks. Sorry bad link everyone whole point API, reason move rather original government app UK, api means information never leaves personal device, one knows meeting think I've ever history seen government intentionally cripple crisis. Please something mitigate... total lockdown, least enforce masks. running head first catastrophe. Memorial Day May 25 probably kicked - saw ton large parties neighborhood get togethers neighborhood. imagine like everywhere.
 

And yeah, 3 weeks, start seeing deaths soon. Rich people gonna rich. Masks aren’t mandatory Quebec, rule people good social distancing many wear masks stores. It’s working. Montreal went epicentre Canada minimal community spread. Let’s hope keeps working. People OC back acting like idiots.. Big Surprise lol CDC, WHO, many so-called ""experts"". Vacancies Del Boca Vista, finally! wanting get months. learned possible things - open schools, bars, businesses, public spaces, lock people houses, etc - without causing mass deaths.

The way things going US, I’d say isn’t case Honestly, bring mask wear anyway. There's reason abide shitty social code family wearing mask maybe it'd make ""not comfortable"" something.

Don't put health hands.

If give shit **who cares**, responsibility *yourself* think making $9.80 hour might one things people fighting against. percentage jobs offer wage high enough live on? Even college education get far anymore. Connections higher ups do. It’s Florida, global warming flooding already built in. enforceable. can't send people jail wearing mask. burden compliance isn’t residents, it’s businesses. city/county order set businesses mandated operate mask policy, don’t liable fines repercussions. personal freedoms residents won’t challenged freedom shop don’t want wear mask. 

I agree need cultural political figures voice need masks non-stop, least progress. real question well city/county monitor, manage, mitigate businesses choose comply. bite behind bark nothing. everyone wants home, market price rentals great families can’t take obligation.

I’ve good landlord tenants.

It’s selfish want situation I’m losing thousands dollars month end sight. Looking graphs, mainly deaths, someone explain say america hasnt passed first wave yet... literally looks like wave peaked downward right now.... NY skewed all. dude nordic people party harder people know. u talking about. drink might break bank would pay ton 50 month get apartment would me. Wya? heat may well slow down, Florida going really screwed come fall it’s bad now. choice quotes ""We going year! Sorry, work healthcare, last thing want vacation wear mask,"" Lilly Stamper posted Cedar Point's Facebook post announcing opening ""I guess visiting season … agree never agree mandatory masks … especially summer heat,"" wrote Kimberly Evans-Mann ""Won't wasting money wearing mask 90 degrees out, ridiculous. need say 'come risk,' folks wanna come stay home,"" Fred Paulsen posted.

This ""we open safely"" nonsense total garbage. People saying convince states open up, intention actually following through. thing happening K-12 higher-ed schools fall, ""We feel confident safely open blah blah blah..."" balls out

bawls out? something I've heard of? Yeah, I'm curious list is. mean, know show obvious reasons, it'd still interesting. Unless find vaccine fast (which unrealistic), *want* last long time. stuck pandemic long time, means people stopped giving shit millions going die virus. possible spread slower. know going look like fall people inside they're trying send kids back school. bump numbers completely expected. Why? 


The openings going come uptick numbers across board. can't hide disease- still matter long lock down. 
Way tests done April May. naturally bring new case numbers up. 


We also big memorial day weekend get togethers people first time many weeks. 


We also massive protests going on, spreading covid even more. 


Wear masks, great. please, stop advocating lockdowns help counter productive efforts get past thing. suggest reading understand works. Misunderstandings killing great progress fighting this!

The system built around privacy. government, Apple Google way knowing contact with. Traditional contact tracing far invasive. America divided caution coronavirus pandemic is. Donald Trump, successful making divisions obvious. understand concept exponential growth? Like daily number going flatten go down. going keep getting bigger bigger faster faster rate mitigated. find disrespectful &amp; disgusting see people wearing masks around grocery stores. protect you, protect me. people don’t care others violates “freedom”. wearing mask stupid hill die on.  Oh ok thanks. hoping dashboard look states well. title take cold, dead, hands. - Arizona propagandist article also cool animations Oh crap, Henry do? ford f-650 supertruck gets 5 MPG ready go. Can't MAGA people wear mask Trump printed American flag something Orange Country.. gone full blown crazy masks..

People acting like Nazi Germany.. cause places wanted require masks rude. ignorant kind inexcusable point considering long information around.  know US acted weeks earlier could saved large amount 100k people died.  countries less money us less resources us handled pandemic far better still foundering. result acting quickly enough US economy going tailspin able recover anytime soon compounding issues pandemic caused.  continue path going far worse situation lockdowns least issues. italian says 50 corpses moved bergamo florence one day incineration could handle more. Additional episodes happened following weeks always two cities. assume closer cities might helped corpses moved regions. 2 weeks article linked.  strange WV broke away Virginia, Virginia way progressive. wondering thing believe news reports difference total compared yesterday’s total cases day day graph counts Florida residents. 

Florida “residents” extremely misleading many people second home here. Many New Yorkers live 4-5 months year winter got stuck virus hit. 

I’d love clarification well I’m wrong. see symptomatic cases bad enough bother get tested Covid19. We're seeing mild cases. 

So even significant spread, gonna see massive amounts severe cases chance thing gets them. like flipping coin every time 20% time u see outcome 80% u don't. 

But think ICUs full people really hard lockdown there's much spread happens. Yep he's find regions around world health economy best buddies one sick one gets sick.

I really feel need good nickname Ronny boy good one already exist? residents “Northeast Transplant Man” BEACHES STILL EXIST. know plenty dumb assholes Florida here, need outside assholes coming addition. starting school kid WA, remember learning ""wild west"" Texas midwest states. east west mixed several years haha Idk, 14 daily smokers. 1 died 4 still hospitalized end study know 5 could die would reverse finding. Seems statically insignificant given sample size one death supppse get mask, wear mask get one? bother one bit. one life live I'm going property afford city/metro enjoy. can't San Diego, Portland next. I'm coming city, whether like not. thought Japanese crazy obsessing blood types. People probably going hospital getting tested day symptoms come up. Realistically timetable closer real life. bc everyone shudder someone says something wrong problem. problem telling vice versa. certainly need bunch mealy mouth know alls telling do. it’s legal make people wear shirts public, shouldn’t legal make people wear masks.

That is... flimsy argument. wearing shirt never killed anybody. cashier making minimum wage took five minutes ring shit. Would like $0.25 cash gift card? say exact thing people supporting Swedish strategy though. trying desperately seen right.

It's pissing contest directions. Totally really isn’t overwhelming evidence support this. fact remains many Swedes going infected die, nowhere near herd immunity.

Nobody anywhere near herd immunity. reality countries re-opening without it. people die everywhere. die anywhere near expotential rates predicted beginning. 

The hospitals cope numbers provide treatments help patients instead killing ventilators. learned pretty fucking stupid idea fill nursing homes C-19 cases. Partly increased testing, see younger people wearing face masks public, except required . beach still see lots people close together, masks, physical contact. news showed large groups congregating outside bars Gaslamp Quarter. think moved quickly opening places. high risk person, avoid crowds anywhere, go grocery store pharmacy. mask anytime could within 6 feet anyone. infection rate San Diego less LA, overly optimistic especially hotels reopened many tourists visiting heavily impacted Arizona. Marin like decades pre Silicon Valley actually followed CDC guidelines, least 18 states would reversing opening instituting shutdown policies. course, task force never wanted establish real benchmarks Fauci Birx already told everyone opening would cause cases rise significantly definitely second wave. Really Happy great masters getting even richer.

Dont surprised start eat rich.

Signed : ""essential worker"" automod uses key words filter. Believing intelligent Florida Man, learned shouldn’t stereotype others. hoping see death satisfy twisted mind? positivity rate (7 day average) 8%. month ago 3 percent. Unless significant unannounced shift testing strategy -- intentionally testing high risk populations -- numbers likely represent real increase case numbers. 

That due increased testing patently false. testing last month 7 day average yesterday 28 days ago -- 28k tests. is, compared one month ago 7 day average testing FLAT! words Churchill. Abba Eban created it. gatherings good go people wear masks now, good know Could be. lived CO AZ, nowhere coast. Sure?

Yesterday Denmark tested 14.149 citizens 50 new cases.

For Sweden find text ""Under vecka 24 analyserades sammanlagt 59861 individers prover"" FOHM website - let's put 10.000 tests pr. day.

But yesterday Sweden 1365 new cases! Even accounting larger population, that's large difference struggle see numbers interpreted suggest Sweden peak. 3,600 Texas yesterday.
We going shitter. Tell stay Florida hear garbage like, ""We safely open things up"" ""We close things gets bad"", etc. garbage. mean, Disney Universal located. trends like this, there's way Disney opening, yet weeks away. think Disney going close?

We've decided want kill people go fun. You’re wrong. Emerging lock downs? Unless population suddenly immune takes one infected person resume spread.

To say nothing countries obviously messing reporting simply testing. Interesting. last two times became sick flu-like symptoms tested, found influenza B, prescribed Tamiflu. depends doctor guess. attended safe riot rather return work--- CNN would say no.

its mild start summer midatlantic, things get going heat island effect, gets absurdly hot. like 90 degrees 10 hot.

sure, may use AC less fringe months like March October.....but usually summer warm humid airmass combined air pollution heavy industry....its fun. propaganda machines legally promote ignorance news might play small part. lot attendees probably listen Fauci might dislike openly hostile towards him. would anyone think would go? Experts say ... Also Wisconsin... give time... naturally isolate others, Sprawled out. However enough people it, even smaller groups start spreading everywhere. Winter coming. must trolling me. 

Scandinavia never brutal lock down. 

Our economies fine. 

Our people happy. 

Except Sweden, one wants got cooties. Lol relief...  countries swinging full recovery mode still arguing fucking masks No. would put much strain supply system.

Airlines dont provide underwear shoes, people expected them. different.  Yeah pilot, kind band aid solution bode well overall maintenance philosophy culture. commercial airline  meed icao standards safety. “Some guys go work school bus, packed like sardines, going across Palm Beach County places, there’s opportunities transmission,” DeSantis said press conference Tallahassee.  
  
  members tightly knit agricultural enclave say isn’t farmworkers’ fault getting sick.    maintain federal government deemed “essential workers” state slow provide community resources farmworker advocates requested slow spread highly contagious virus.   Tovar, executive director Farmworker Association Florida, accused DeSantis ignoring pleas coalition 50 groups asked governor help late sent letter governor two months ago realizing foreign workers suitable get infected. shameful advised, told sent letter,” Tovar told News Service Florida Wednesday.    letter asked DeSantis, Florida Cabinet members state lawmakers expand access COVID-19 testing rural areas, provide personal protective gear farmworkers offer alternative housing options workers live crowded conditions.    request went unanswered, Tovar said association enlisted three women make 200 cloth face coverings workers.

  “It little late,” said. “It two weeks ago department (DOH) sent email lot organizations saying, ‘Hey! received 2 million face masks. want give face masks.’” True. true. started behind nations trying catch incompetence. Rafael ~2% vote (about 200k people). FL, AZ, TX, CA seeing record numbers new cases day day none talking reimposing lockdowns. Hell AZ announced day they'd let local leaders decide whether implement mask wearing ordinances. 

It's amazing badly handling virus country. like figured longer news 24/7 longer problem. feel like Texans epitome ""but muh freedumbs!""

Except comes buying beer alcohol certain times though.... know decide anything. assuming get choice matter based semantics. Nowhere specifically stated decision matter. 


He said ""she want to"" along bunch information clarifies situation completely choosing neglect. one us WANTS lose quit jobs virus, mean say matter.

Even OP give ultimatum, would still choice whether wants continue working not.

AND right choice OP think so, right choice alternative going put whole family's life danger. still unable understand this? one?! That's lot BTW. many flu seasons say knew 10 people one nearly died? case NONE. Therefore conclude lot worse flu.  Thanks. used sub 24/7 family member died Covid 19 much. get sea lioning annoying, sometimes it’s honest question. think people enjoy looking like smartest person room vs. actually sharing information. Thanks nice person. there’s short supply” guaranteed cause panic theft hospitals, though. 

Yeah think overlooking replies think haha. operating assumption yes shitty say cause panic. looking get rid would needed Trump Fauci together tell people wear homemade masks, demonstrate wear together consistently. encourage everyone make like victory gardens WWII. 

Absolutely, I'm completely ya this. think would help panic still explain there's mask shortage explain population make masks Legionnaires mold. HVAC helps distribute droplets people people. Stay away diffusers grills. virus isn’t incubating inside units. yes properly maintain everything. Name shame partly blame

Edit: message looks harsh retrospect. Sorry situation good luck going forward. completely agree. I'm suggesting air conditioning CAUSES spread, likely helps. I'm saying people inside air conditioning available. since is, virus spread available. Also, recirculation air might actually help spread. No. Fascinating see play countries value money value life. far side scale goes actions taken. eveeyone luxury waiting happen 3-6 months planning financially beneficial move. lease summer, like many are, renew move, take get demand stays high.. Real estate - owning renting - hard time. Always always wil be.

I agree though, drop demand next year plan use negotiate rent reduction. Meteor 2020 end it. yet see half folks masks on. Way look fellow man Overall still think LA county better food. Still enough flights coming back level.... could even worse. poor guy got killed Dollar Store reason. mom works small locally owned retail store mask mandate owner high risk, yelled time since reopened late last month. I'm worries one might shoot her. God hate ignorant ass people sometimes. thing going around popular culture 1918 look turned out. thought people would mature bit 100 years. wrong. agree, concept, still say choice was:

1) Lie general public try make sure enough PPE front line,

or

2) Tell truth, expect public (or least 99.99% act responsibly), follow CDC guidelines.

It's clear public (as whole) dumb fuck. People can't even wear masks properly. takes small portion population act bad faith reduce supply PPEs, #2 probably worst two options.

Is 3rd option mean CDC lies, keeps general public significantly reducing supply masks? happened. diseases, infected pretty much showing symptoms right away. difference coronavirus maybe able spread virus even without symptoms. definitely back normal.

Those reports based press release Statistics Sweden stated preliminary numbers slightly 5-year average, added expected 200 deaths would added total final figures in. 

In words, headline bullshit article intentionally written misleading.

In fact actually According preliminary statistics, number deaths week 22 1,524. slightly lower average 2015–2019, 1,569 deaths.  happened week since corona eruption Sweden. expect number deaths week 22 revised 200, means probably still see excess mortality even week, says Tomas Johansson, population statistician Statistics Sweden.

 

The latest figures state actually 1,620 deaths Week 22, 3.3% average, numbers yet final.  virus attacking single demographic. infect anyone capability infect. think less self-preservation selfishness. I've talked people say they'll perfectly fine they're 80. apparently give shit anyone else understand spread asymptomatically/presymptomatically. Ugh GOP disgusting comes treating human beings dignity. in, masks protest  fuck one party actively trying kill people? VA - people ignoring mandate it. beyond sad lack respect. Perhaps throw well. Kazakhstan free. classic example correlation equal causation.

Just like example frequently used statistic courses ""Ice cream sales cause drowning"" 

Observed records showed ice cream sales increased, drownings increased. issues caused another thing ""co-variate"" changed time (temperature).

I'm saying recirculated air impact, regions high AC usage high temps. Behavior changes drastically temperatures go 100 Arizona. people congregate inside together. assume similar behavior observed Florida Cali. Scandinavians immune mental crisis?

Wow Remember vote party, ever again. alternative perfect, even good cases. not, evil. testing hold due protests. would bet surge testing results also people participated getting tested. 

The icu beds hospitalizations seem holding relatively steady, positive. 

This never going stopping it. keeping control. seems average deaths still around spot months. 

It’s sad, due openings doubt rise. new record would seem due hated phrase “but mor testing!” Even tho open think morph hybrid system pretty quickly. Kids members household get sick forced quarantine. parents sick kid can’t attend school. lessons need made available remotely addition person work. 

Even tho doors open certainly won’t return “normal” Clearly right choice OP think so? want quit, then, clearly right choice, frankly hell decide that? 

Note please I'm saying *isn't* right choice her, you, me, OP people deciding - should. 

Again, I'm assuming anything. OP's initial post said made decision. Multiple people called out, response want to. he's saying accurate, *his* responsibility correct that. I'm taking says face value, I'm sure I'm supposed anything else. Damn went subreddit, genuinely terrifying reading people testing positive go through. might wholesome kindest misunderstanding I've ever seen site. Also much worth noting LOT New Yorkers (most probably) shitty living situations usually deal staying apartment much possible. Cramped/dirty apartments, random roommates, many roommates, lack natural light, etc par course city. experience suburbanites holed McMansions families backyards. great aunt survived 18months one leg one lung. given 24 hours live priest round give last rites 10 times... 

I’m glad blood flowing veins! big issue causing high demand rent live burbs. ive happily done forever. big city folk want downsize get city, suburb rental market surging. Rents cities certainly going less demand. feel bad landlord charging 2500/month closet house paid years ago, charge 2200/month wait 7 weeks rented. Yeah. I'm near San Francisco. Huge dense population, air conditioning big thing. Sweden get unemployed funds (a-kassa) self-employed/freelancer (enskild firma) must liquidate company. reason enskilda firmor excluded furloughed rules, state payed salary limited companies (they things ease though, 18% less tax year). 50% 615000 companies enskilda firmor (many side business).

In Denmark equivalent type company could get 23.000 DKK per month, Norway 80% last three year average. Can't find statistics Finland, thing us requirement liquidate company unemployment funds, changed counted side business could apply anyway seems.

Having less bankruptcies normal sound good though, since paying companies gone bankrupt reasons, end would get money state one way another guess. Use air conditioning means enough people working indoors warrant use air conditioning white collar workplaces already risk coronavirus appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* needs good news. know, I’ve ALWAYS felt rights infringed upon Ive required wear shirt shoes.. entire society hinges assholes world might well give now. Great slowed. ever going 0? No

Any problems healthcare system? No

So yeah free practice personal responsibility, otherwise curve flat hospital capacity dont lock upvote.

Reddit folks love vote dumb reasons. official policy Reddit care.

I thought question entirely reasonable fair. We're still learning here. one whose government said symptomatic people go work(even tho context principle potus saying things UV bleach) get diseases air conditioners too

Clean maintain air conditioners people I'm unsympathetic toward decision makers pandemic - many rock hard place ever one. come on... decisions policies advertised right seem ill advised. add poorly decisions communicated... fill confidence, that's sure. mean...outside spread still much thing. haven’t massive outbreaks tied protests, cities released testing data protesters found dozens people infected them. I'm disagreeing, wifes huge extended family wuhan. I'm stating original reported numbers wrong. believe done purpose , know much cluster fuck early days. basically impossible test people early days. brand new virus, expected test everybody. number look percent positive tests. increasing testing without bigger spread percent positive drop.

We're currently seeing pretty large increase percent positive. asinine. Masks work. people making masks political. think problem consider re-open Clusters get &amp; common. isolated cases among community longer. young athletes minor symptoms, imagine 40 50-something maintenance workers university. would see number hospitalizations there's chance see deaths. LA County, 1/4 1/3 covid deaths right working aged (under 65). football team example serves warning. stop landlord. risky business. untrue. indeed evidence supporting use non-medical masks. protection virus, way mitigate transmission virus. thought qualified ""because medical personnel need them"". see, point already full scale lockdown March see happened? contained, wait next outbreak another. isn't, full scale lockdown, right?  Whack mole. 

I repeat, unless limit movement citizens, something even Red army able do, close borders, lockdown best holding measure. flaw execution, flaw theory. Doctor what? get degree ""Hollywood upstairs medical appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* fucking good ask question day correlation equal causation.

Now finally beginning admit SARS2 spreads predominantly via aerosolized droplet nuclei (which remain airborne much longer travel orders magnitude droplets), eventually also admit 6ft rule much curb spread (at least, compared mask usage). lowest number cases PA seen thursday since beginning virus.

While states peaking, PA decreasing. No, you’re working minimum wage job trying pay alone you’re wring. Flipping burgers takes skill, provide little value company you’re compensated such.

If want make enough money live side job make valuable. Urban dictionary never disappoints Fauci make tough choice there, one forced think PPE shortage. enough masks start would easy tell everyone wear mask start. Yeah, I'm calling bullshit. grew coalfields late 80s early 90s. quality education great, definitely taught science ""vilified devil's teaching.""

Don’t want follow questions - don’t post article.  don’t mind comments. roles reversed would done same. also understand fortunate enough choice us. know it’s everyone. want us able enjoy seeing kids grow together. tossed window Americans want dumb collectively doesn’t make sense me. cynical part thinks, absence sports, music given people urge go protest, way getting house actually. seems are. I've seen headline lots sites misleading. actually something worries US (or parts US). one chance solve this. destroyed economy solve states solve enough. People going accept another lockdown. economy got fucked pretty much nothing. Ontario, Canada got lucky, people serious generally, government provided adequate (while still maybe lacking bit) social welfare weather crisis reopening tons testing uptick far number cases. province 14 million people 200 cases per day (for past week) 20k tests per day (they actually sometimes struggle find people test nobody sick). Exactly, marina Well stupid take it’s still stupid take now. primary difference states back March/April going taking drastic measures took people going take risk seriously see consequences time. Don’t want sound harsh refuse wear mask - couple minutes - access government services maybe don’t really need services, badly?  everything. Trump say contradictory things. thing said really existed. Flu cause nearly much people get organ damage blood clots eitheer. flu kill? Yes, sometimes, COVID 19 kills way that. like H2N1 was, bit potent normal, WAY potent. Go back before? LOL! Unless science eradicate it, ain’t happening. Even then, globe changed. Precautions post-pandemic world stay. I’m saying means everyone everywhere wear masks every day. precautions various infections handled thoughtful manner before. going on? due tight living arrangements? It’s unfortunate don’t option course am, whole point... exactly unbiased, understandably so. rightfully angered CCP change much COVID19 reporting highly questionable best. bot annoying holy shit. said vaccine best chance returning normal life, parties strongly behind mobilize release public. comparison measures like social distancing mask-wearing, still require sacrifice. Sheltering place vaccine would result worst economic disaster world history. depression bad would raise question it’s really worth many people continue lives.

Sheltering place situation actually control reopening done without explosion cases way go. Wishing death people dont align political ideology. dont even know say fellow Americans anymore. want lower rent, higher salaries, less hours, free healthcare?

That’s odds itself. Maybe read article find out..?  agree anymore you. WTF. disgusting politicians said they'd step people acting appropriately (mayor's, governors, president). see this...and almost entirity people charge look way. make fake regulations re-opening, care followed. “Cause death determined” 

I mean...are going skip past part? went pickup wine allocation last weekend Paso, needed get LA beautiful drive. surprised see many wine tasting parking lots filled even shocked drove Pismo Beach saw insane amount people walking around without face masks. friends drove Santa Barbara beach walk saw restaurants packed, people booze cruises, masks, craziness! depends whether grocery store barber shop walls ceiling. neither risks similar. people still wearing masks. nearly enough them, least.  That's NYC seemingly control. 

The question rest country go completely rails Seeing couple friends isn’t even bad... social distanced practically everyone 2 months got bored. take precautions still, don’t force hidey hole that. love bobbin' orange knob got done watching Governor Dewine's briefing today. metrics Ohio trending down, except 700 new cases today. highest amount since May 21st. I'll curious see today's number noise start new upward trend.

The Governor made seem like increases tied certain hotspots appearing southwest area state. sending guard members increase testing zip codes showing troubling trend. There’s high school cali told couldn’t graduation principal one time hand people came cars.

Then everyone except principal went mass graduation event, almost masks, close physical contact, graduation anyways. Vice principal, student advisors there.

Some people don’t care anyone dies   People hate love Governor Cuomo New York laid two approaches going country comes political theory, public relations theory versus science-based, fact-based theory


And think sums country right now. knew January means Newfoundland Labrador, learned. Arizona. Cheers friend! rooting you. Thanks! Gollums throat clear makes much sense now. precious indeed. Theres good news front. Tons candidates already massed produced way available minute approved thrown Cities across Northeast massive protests saw zero uptick cases. fact cities seeing massive decline cases. states suffering ones stigmatize mask use eased lockdown way soon. like Battle Bunker Hill Jaguars fan, I'm tempted dv this. Funny mention ICU beds, keep reading ICU beds Arizona Texas starting run out, well Flordia, maybe Alabama. Look back 1918 mask laws. wore masks. knew worked long time ago. Americans don’t believe anything true consensus Ivy League doctors says so, that’s damn slow. Wuhan keyword Numb nuts! Death toll meaningless hospitals subsidized check corona box. Believing death count even close accurate naivety point, pushing agenda. Maybe it’s higher? it’s much likely lot lower. Thoughts prayers. 


Sorry government failed Florida citizens state local governments. 

Heart goes seniors affected.  True, scientists agree. Different studies produce different results important. need constant challenges scientific community keep updating theories allow continued research. 

However, Fauci right sentiment, whether choose agree perspectives epidemic not. Americans turn celebrities scientists don’t trust research. worse quote “experts” aren’t really experts. sorry don’t care chiropractor say vaccines psychologist say epidemiology. field science highly specialized needs respected. Someone title Dr. front name doesn’t make experts areas. Thank you. 2020 fall semester looking like? ripped Spring 2020 distance learning outbreak march critical NY feel robbed.

I'm big believer getting pay for...Considering aggressive nature virus, seems though worst yet, even qualified make assumptions all; students worry registering upcoming semester?

I refunded parking permit used three weeks. given proper attention distance learning implemented, transition confusing unprofessional. many students like lives outside school, enough worry right now. 

I personally benefit online classes. wish did, could make decision less expensive online education. However learn actual learning environment. expect anyone know exactly weather NY colleges remain open degree, refuse pay thousands dollars another half ass semester. 

Thoughts? Honestly dude, mostly agree original post, especially part healthcare working without masks contributing spread. 

We get ample opportunity test differing strategies months come.

I sorry Canadian social net robust Scandinavian ones. pay lot taxes though, fund tools.  link, probably requires quite lot context: confused permissive stance public gatherings. 

So, no, they're saying mass gatherings present covid risks. And, indeed, they're highlighting need adhering physical distancing mitigation measures. Let's real, probably even know get past abstract scientific literature. Why? know. Welp. I’m resident physician starting ICU july 1 central Florida (UF). Send help 


ETA: I’m asthmatic (moderate-severe). control rn still god damnit Imagine anti mask crusader Reddit. Look m' Twitter vids! Masks work!!!

[Flippant comment] [exit conversation] What’s encouraging lately increases haven’t exponential either. staying steady changing rapidly. accelerating too.... they'll looking 500,000 deaths long. adverse effects flu vaccine? commonly reported symptom pain injection site, followed short fever lasting longer 1-2 days.

And yet one COVID-19, we? actual vaccine least 18 months away, far, much way actual help acute cases. 

New diseases evolve every day, stands reason ones take advantage human overpopulation going wreak havoc. wonder drugs yesteryear failing bacteria viruses evolve overcome them.

Having treatments available bulk diseases much comfort bulk people can't afford them, though.

Scientists saying wash hands wear mask avoid spreading germs onto people. difficult reason people get offended it.

And really, wanted Typhoid Mary wash hands, least, *not* work kitchens, handled food dirty, unwashed hands vulnerable people ate. 

But insisted putting people risk behavior. Yup lol. Apparently Trump also hinting towards moving Tulsa’s rally stadium hold 40K people due “tremendous response”. Either they’re thinking adding second venue overflow get people packed elsewhere 

You can’t make shit Welcome America! probably contracted virus protesters rioters Hookers cheap hell super ugly. coke. It’s mostly baby laxatives. Ugh, got job move state. apartment never going let stop paying rent here. Dog park actually.

Reality forced take step back, he's much coward anything himself. like zombie apocalypse, can't tell zombies are... failed people, country, government nation. I’m torn this. they’d said “make mask,” way many people would ignored gone hoarded masks available, fucking medical community. it’s also okay lie people, we’ve shown world fucking selfish are. Damned matter what. wish true nothing-to do- town central Florida. Average rent around 800 month.

That's irresponsible even trying one available them. MAYBE healthcare workers - that's it. even wouldn't. believe not...I think Alabama trending poorly. Arizona far away worst terms new growth (228 per million). Alabama 2nd....160/million.

Utah getting much attention new cases per million ( 106) Florida ( 93) Texas (76) 1-2 years either vaccine, treatment, herd immunity.

I've seen 1-2 years hopeful much longer possible vaccine.

A treatment good mean gone.

And herd immunity going take long fucking time.

So ""sooner rather later"" think not.

(But completely hope right soon...) fuck even talking about? like cheese strings? fair, know feel arresting people breaking quarantine. 

Education first offense warning, fine, followed much bigger fine third one, sure. 

But what's arresting people gonna do? exception would someone willingly spreading maliciously. Illinois averaging 20k tests per day, positivity 3 percent.

Regrettably highest count cook county close indiana wisconsin.

I know fact wisconsinites complying mask ordinances Oh 2020, kill me.

No, really... spokesperson Lisa Stromme Warren said error missing line code

I always mess mundane detail  usually but... upvote ""T daddy"". TL;DR right thing hard try. Abusive parents problem, yes. Chile dogpiled 30,000 cases previous weeks onto today, skewing total. looks like standard day otherwise. First line article and, non American, baffled:

Sorry guys, might used this, law enforcement officers aligned national party NORMAL, ACCEPTABLE. 


Add list things work US...


Edit: rephrase original post, bc bot blocked naming poli_tical party member... may find interest regarding Tenth Amendment public health.  interested getting antibody test, worried going inside facility blood drawn. inside establishment (except grocery store) 3 months. think little risk infection going inside get antibody test? Illinois. speak truth unpopular truth. Yeah totally talking economy public health consequences. Vietnam? 100M population hundred Kilometers shared border China, death 400 case far. location honestly... TIL wearing mask prevent needless death oppressive tyranny. whole time thought mild inconvenience. pretty much going duct tape elderly massively high risk dad chair prevent going physical psychological petre dish event.

Odd, Trump running primaries, dad laughed called joke...

...6 months Facebook Fox News later voting him.

Years Facebook Fox News later loves old joke enough put life line support him.

Propaganda way powerful I'd ever imagined. Showing symptoms America.

Let #Plandemic continue! cites rule law, picks chooses one enforce. It’s like guys took injury part brain processes hypocrisy. \~500k tests/day nationally, \~100k/day April 1st. states contact tracer teams employed. PPE shortages solved - look many mask sanitizer options available Amazon.

As people refusing comply... expect government do? Start jailing people left right? hot spot left untouched. forgot guarantee wealth go fast inflation does. much misinformation? sounds like someone care truth is. Look hospital stats number beds used, number dead state. Read 1 paper. see truth. Yeah. that. get use us guinea pigs...again. Best test people first. much history there. yes, explain necessary - - gonna happen. Never mind; read comment history realized racist piece shit. report shows immunity antibodies isn’t long lasting. Nothing says many doses donated. infrastructure how. Nothing impossible course, difference infrastructure cargo capacity China pretty much everyone else staggering. 

The top ten ports globally capacity mostly mainland China. ports India combined probably capacity less Shanghai. 

Then need ships, trucks, logistics centers. India rest SEA things way enough even vaguely make dent.  Thank god Target right thing. $200 really put dent one Milllion $ hospital stays. disputing 600 - (2% 20k) = 200? 2700 - (2% 30k) = 2100? 2100 3x 200? math doing?

I notice give source saying switched tests. Maybe simply wrong? education crisis country along lot selfish people. someone living AZ, Pinal actually pretty 50/50 terms politics. guy 50 side that’s little predictable lmao we, like close border OC.. maybe camp Pendleton. Keep shit San Diego better worse Americans elect many many offices probably apolitical. benefits. whole subreddit thinks democracy mistake. That's everyone wants live oppressive tyranny badly. Even common cold immunity lasts year. Either immunity lasts months, test used shit, people never first place. US healthcare workers low infection rate due better practices ppe. FDA wake yet buried pile Hydroxychloroquine anti-mask people complain freedom wear mask, people's rights *to* wear mask. see people supposedly care freedom speaking behalf people want wear mask. article contradicts much end know trust anymore.

Also, people mild symptoms coronavirus causes Covid-19, may even know it. human-to-human transmission confirmed late January, many doctors nurses Wuhan wearing extra protective gear treat patients.
“They got infected Sars-CoV-2 fought virus immune systems,” according Wang team, using clinical name coronavirus. Depends. Asians mostly good time fighting battle. 2 week quarantine up? (really 24 40 days dealing high risk populations concentrated space like nursing home) I'm sad see downvoted. point shutdown prevent overwhelming hospitals. Staying locked beyond serves purpose. path forward social distancing, wearing masks, protecting nursing homes risk. That's lot Karens probably see movement another 6-12 months. can't believe we're still conversations.

I completely agree. many people, like yourself, seem think masks help [abundance scientific research actual randomized controlled (not ""models"") show benefit respiratory diseases. 

I understand fear, continue go without mask. Also we’ve massive protests. makes happy small rural county Pennsylvania flattened curve businesses staying open. passed 90 cases. Pot calling kettle black, ladies gentlemen One thing painfully clear: pandemic far over.

One thing painfully clear: Lockdowns, even Draconian, CCP, military supervised ones, answer.  Unless enforce continuously world-wide, delay, solution. You’re asking want prove reason died Covid magical condition clearly point article clearly point post clearly isn’t appropriate thing ask time. you’re clearly asshole mobility data clearly show mobility decline Sweden nearly far EU countries including neighbors. That's true, considering ones making mandates open, obviously helps. proof pudding, check numbers. November 5th 1955, Yes time invented time travel. Please repeat me: 

This mask. many like it, one mine.

My mask best friend. life. must wear must breathe.

Without me, mask useless. Without mask, infectious. must wear mask securely. must wear mask consistently neighbor trying infect me. must move way sidewalk breathes near me. die allow acquire transmit virus… We're screwed.

Source: Floridian talking leper colony problem is, dude. many people believe able magically figure things try harder ok . I've worked entire adult life, often 2 jobs donating plasma make extra money. time I've ever spend kids since they've born 10 5 years old. want go back working one two jobs still able make ends meet see family. Even making $9.80 hour, qualify food stamps amount pay share cost ""medically needy insurance"" money bring home month. make sense ruining lot people's quality life long time. People who've never live like understand. Cheese puffs. Stale round airlines desperate, don’t trust decision making desperate people businesses. close you?

I hope they're least 6 feet away. even possible USA year school deadly war?

Because anything possible cherry-pick numbers bend statistics fit narrative. 15 million high school students year around 20,000 military personnel deployed active combat zones. Never mind fact two outlier shootings year responsible 22 school deaths. Go look many people died school shootings 2019 you’ll realize school shootings aren’t nearly much issue media wants believe. Lmao think lot people still going want lifestyle.

My SF based friends posting pictures takeout Michelin starred restaurants to-go cocktails going drives Napa even lockdown.

Meanwhile, I'm suburbs Massachusetts, living pasta applesauce nothing watching Netflix. 

They like lifestyle afford pay it. quarantine, going every day, even they're making it. New cases useless useless metrics. Might well counting sneezes per fortnight. 

Follow new hospitalizations percent positivity. He’s political person. would attended rally anyway.


But he’s right support mass gatherings middle pandemic. fact microscopic virus become politicized makes fucking scared live America anymore. lots extremely kind, intelligent people I’m lucky live NE, seems like lately people whose voices heard nut job Republicans south think climate change, evolution, virology liberal conspiracies. mean assaulting you? 

Wear one anyway, fuck them. get decide something deal breaker. woman wants wear condom, want to, free choose sex you. 

Just like OP make request, wife want to, decide leave. 

A better example would woman wanted wear condom, want to, forced wear go ahead sex anyway. 

The OP literally commented say wanted care patients - he's plenty chances clarify asked, discussion. Pretty clear point unilateral choice. Everyone is.

It’s human nature live socially distanced Denmark, intelligent policies helped business community weather storm *caused COVID-19* much better places, much much better Sweden. According Google, Oklahoma +259 cases June 17. Highest increase far since March. Steady incline upward lately. in, despite feeling superior smarter Americans, us New Yorkers also complete morons.

More news 11. mean EpicotCenter. Sure, Penn. 18.2% (and #8) ""ton"" Florida 20.8 nothing geriatrics? tired trope. Sure lot people retire like state one big nursing home. people like aunt around. weak heart, overweight..etc risk yeah wash hands bathroom let alone coming back local Walmart. wear mask claims weak heart it'll make pass out. 

We several types masks cunt. Already told thinks flu deadlier sent actual facts ignores it. people like virus stop soon. It’s dry heat *A sad pieces confetti flutter ground...* 10:30 a.m., Thursday, Florida Department Health reported 85,926 confirmed cases COVID-19 state, increase 3,207 Wednesday’s update. experience roommates experience tested due possible exposure jobs. tested 2 completely different places, drive thru test site clinic. I'm willing bet common experience. Anyone experienced extreme pain probably someone test roughly. uncomfortable end eyes got watery anything would call actual pain. know saw CNN. ain't drinking koolaid. Relevancy comes defense cowardly defeatist swedish governments measures since arent father friend using safety internet speak, cant find tell person unclear Lamb wore mask followed social distancing protocols event believes came contact infected person.

[literally picture guy holding check dated June 8th titled re-elect sheriff lamb next bunch people wearing sheriff lamb shirts indoors, close together nobody wearing Better got Jersey sure rough ride us. planning high school gyms would get set field hospitals. 

Models looks like won’t get badly hospitals get little hairy bit.  Well, theory lower. yes, difference normal life whatever is, smaller less restrictions. Still, baseline reason higher Sweden elsewhere, absolutely true. would sharing data spreadsheet posts provide reader? Everyone knows testing going on. People interested trends I'm showing. Coming someone starting medical school US, we're also remote semester. may think sounds insane first two years (m1-m2) extremely common students basically never go class use outside resources work. Obviously I'm going miss anatomy lab hopefully return January.

My point much lot degrees (both undergrad graduate) easily done remotely really huge deal. really comes self motivated enough learn own. cry you. 

Actually all. illegal profit residential housing. 

You leech. kid school picked many groups. goth still picked goths even. mom teacher can't remember dad did. 

But one day house got raided dad taken jail. arsenal home highly explosive deadly weapons. 

No one picked that. dead CCP comment facetious.
Like umm whimsical exaggeration thats meant taken seriously.

But comment measuring government success alive true, that's kind bad measure..   China: sprinkle COVID20 COVID21, destruction please. 😋 latter. daily death toll disconnecting daily case toll. We're kind slouching towards different strategy here: Protect vulnerable let everyone else risk getting virus that's virus wants. I'm commenting whether right strategy, clearly U.S., least, going. Ya basically case ""seeing blood wounded person bad - therefore, vacuum blood heal them"". Taking premise coming terrible conclusion. could countries *everyone* able implement robust Test, Trace, Isolate infrastructure. Good start! miracle still understand...

So virus spread without symptoms right? know New Zealand's testing record, clearly tested 4 million people country. could ""eradicate"" virus island nation people asymptomatic? asymptomatic people spread virus without knowing it? Resulting people getting virus showing symptoms... Right?  100% allergies. 

Nasal congestion isn’t even one “rare” symptoms. Sore throat post nasal drip cause sore throat.  Also, Minimum wage already raised least $15 many places. getting ahead law would made anyway. I'm pretty sure US laws studying it.  Experts shouldn’t surprised. use black bodies unethical way, black participants even put another situation like that? Racism public health problem. Thank you!! Thats even less informative mediocre description habbits... so? Prove wrong, link uses state CDC data. rolling 7 day percentage positives overall declining US. Yes states sharp rise like Florida Arizona, majority declining. Cars depreciating asset become worthless time eventually break completely.

Now ask houses. it’s house appreciates. It’s land sits on. population increases, people need housing. means land that’s desirable areas gets valuable every single day. 

Now giant McMansions middle nowhere? Yeah gonna suffer. doesn’t include even indoor dining restaurants, high risk things like movie theaters concert halls still closed. Wtf want do? Yep. beach last place I'd worried about, least ones area. None crowded dangerous place would bathroom, pee damn ocean go. 
Show picture church, restaurant, gym bar, places I'd avoid costs. count 3 developed.

Armenia, Belaru, Peru. guess could include Chile per capital gdp $15k rest per Capita gdp greater $30k. Even executive order putting stay evictions, friend evicted. judge claimed enforce eviction laws haven’t actually changed. Apparently, it’s deputy comes evict decide perform not. one came evict friend followed it. 

This wild, people supposed go get evicted, shelters open new people. really going snowball control. call Tegnell Gieseck literally saying strategy herd immunity ""spam"". arguing good faith. Yeah I'm surprised, Florida popular epicenter days. People become super-spreaders cause super-spreading event. exactly you’re talking about. quick look CA dashboard \[1\] see new cases coming LA county. digging deeper, even worse that. normalize population, see today's new cases 0.134 per 1000/population LA county, 0.035 per 1000/population San Diego county. \*huge\* differences (4x) two population centers. 

I know enough CA really explain what's going here.

\[1\] course seriously. got one smidgen evidence lying. know live absolute worst news agencies world yet still choose believe them. Shocking. made rich forgot us. Ya that’s pretty much large part population here. Sigh... B-but outside, virus can't get we're outside RIP Conservatives One biggest reasons suspensions work incredibly inconvenient parent student little shit home school (and thus forcing parent make plans deal them). 

Suspension video class student already home time parent extremely stressed dealing ton bullshit already going effect. Thank u 4 ur service I'm Westchester, near city, people wearing masks, I'm seeing LOT wearing nose, including postal Fed Ex workers inside businesses. Wait but... cops seen without masks? teach kind logic school. Younger, young. Younger typical Covid19 victim thought be. human brain recognize useful patterns like deer plant filled area woods Jesus piece burnt toast, right way chip piece flint useful tool see monsters shadows closet. Sometimes see connections really there. 

We learn listen bodies brains sometimes right times not. Sometimes good react without thinking ie someone yanks ahead traffic swerve hopefully someone else... times jumping primal self thought motion stick no, poisonous snake time. idk trolling choosing willfully ignorant. [Half white med school today still hold belief POC higher pain tolerance black ""thicker skin"". Here's [very broad solid sources dives health inequity Black communities. Black babies infant mortality rate [more races. accounts suspicious patterns this: one posted constantly defending Swedish strategy. There's link herd immunity overview post, near bottom. one submitted article goes directly parroting government narrative herd immunity strategy, drop act. Surprise! whole town’s leadership rona! Irish hospitals virtually empty right remaining patients long stints Iceland elite. wonder participation rate would US, probably one lowest country. 

Convincing someone give privacy kind hard. many cowards would rather risk life rather ruffle feathers.  


The profit margins worth life messages say know taking hardline stance turn customers even though probably encourage others. Sounds good me! Bring law. France well, several clusters detected schools. blame Desantis--who can't stand-- people wearing masks, though master Trump certainly help regard.  


People know masks, least, help degree. may help LOT. absolute no-brainer wear MUST public place near people, especially indoors.  Many know this, yet rebel it. think even say fuck care much, hate politics, life lead yada yada. Yet give new comments despite ""HeRd ImMuNiTy"" spam. I'm generous god laughed loud, literally top 5% probably gaining money.

The rest eating it.

The systematic destruction middle class begun. wonderful government instilled public mask bad narrative trying get voluntary compliance going extreme challenge. bet see anti-mask protests high noncompliance rate can't ticket jail way narrative spun. You’re brave. Vaccines safe way reach herd immunity. way requires lots suffering death anyone dies he’s responsible right? 3 weeks NY shutdown peak hospitalization.

And see shutdown coming Idk... NZ, Germany, Australia seem great. 

You're definitely correct even ""literally everywhere"" Minneapolis. Good let stupid knuckle-dragging mouth-breathers drop dead What’s third? realize people still need ICU beds for, like, stuff right? landlord sent letter renewing leases pandemic month month future time. 

Im sure would that.

We already month month lease 2 years. Depends measure it...the ""anti-science"" crowd heading cliffs Darwin like lemmings Orange Baffoons ass... 


All stay home wear mask public...it never rocket surgery. Yep totally drove rent prices moved here. Also traffic increased exponentially Sacramento last years. time go town hall either expert complete idiot. in-between, sometimes both. Thanks posting. I’ve watching stories develop I’m supposed head fall🤞🤞hope keeping everyone safe. Black lives matter isn’t valid comparison? 

Are suggesting motor vehicle deaths lower year? misleading essentially false. top three countries life expectancy Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore. South Korea #10, Taiwan #38. US #43. Thailand #53. difference life expectancy Hong Kong US 5.8 years; difference US Thailand 2 I’m gonna say, resident Arizona Maricopa County, happy *our* Sheriff always making headlines anymore. Don’t even know guys name. Don’t know thing him. 

He must fantastic. blame central PA.

 Philly wants it, understand necessity precautions. Pittsburgh far know (Allegheny county) virus well control. 

My girlfriend Franklin county, 95% populace ""virus = hoax"" crowd. Needless say franklin county (chambersburg, specifically) one highest growing cities entire country new cases, one time. 

Most people went HS ""virus bad, middle America suffering!!!"" Crowd even though none money problems whole time. 

Yeah. Pennsylvanians dumb(but thankfully) Feeeeereearrrrrrr going High Court soon, federal government challenging border closures unconstitutional. say, Victoria already harshest restrictions country testing prevent this. Climate + population might factor. Musical chairs? like musical chairs chairs people.

Dunning-Kruger effect conspiracy theorists, I’m probably mostly wrong. seen evidence tens millions donations, you? Alright high enough. upvotes!

You get fucking deserve! Karmic irony. I'm landlord I've increased rents 7 years.... reduced rent reward great tenant great job looking place. saving money repairs maintenance careful. won’t truly safe there’s vaccine. That’s really bottom line. Disney enough reduce risk catching it? Maybe. flying safe? likely not. hotels safe? knows? 

One thing check hotel side O-zone generator run room arrive. someone really stinks place. 

At Disney really wear mask wash sanitize hands frequently picky attractions restaurants visit. Maybe showering someone. blood types make severe? Trump stopped white house staff requirement...

So **know** good idea wear one swear headline week It’s less COVID-19 saving money. 

I’m going thing. Way Covid, overheard industrial coffee machine expensive upkeep. thing touch screen makes different coffees cup.

1) certain states impacted early showing sustained declines transmission fatality rates.

2) large protests appear associated significant uptick virus transmission. can't rule out, seen evidence it. Outdoor activities wearing mask appear make **substantial** difference transmission.

3) mortality rate-- high feared. anti body tests show high 20 percent population certain states may already exposed recovered. high remains unclear. 

**bad news**

1) handful states opened. showing modest daily gains, might expect want, accelerating...but also longer declining.

2) threat widespread outbreaks ripe environments still real. small county Oregon went 6 cases 240 1 week. culprit gathering indoors church masks used.

3) Texas, Florida, Arizona California ballooning cases increasing test positive rates hospitalization rates. control yet, clearly reopening lot it. get control ASAP could go south hurry hospitals maxxed out.

**intangibles:**

 outlook hospitality industry remains poor. folks unemployed since March. benefits run soon unclear opportunities be. ready sit restaurants.

the badnews fall far away. tremendous pressure send students back school. could spread virus far wide communities. Meanwhile come corona 30k enough places nearly enough others curious. 

The particular sample culture inactivation method. 

Obviously millions combinations there. I’ve read conflicting studies certain diseases seasonal others. Heat, sunlight, human behavior, etc. seasonality certainly thing. don’t think know yet covid19 effected. Similarly, read: 

""Surprise, Arizona! Mayor tested positive COVID-19""

like addressing Arizona whole. switched vegan diet. ! 2022. :( homes sale? still see selling much deal fit enough go hiking seriously thinking keeping windows taking way way seriously. I'm getting tested regardless. symptoms morning (nothing seriously respiratory something definitely right nausea, diarrhea, chills, stomach pains). feel lot better though. Hoping means quick recovery, knows virus unpredictable.

Who knows, maybe stomach bug. Either way, gonna get tested. interim health minister basically likes military dictatorahip, like president  I'm gonna deny I'm sick person happy this. No, again, fuck China stop them. Start opening plants India, close plan China. 

South Korea already it, China going lose billions everyone moves PPE basic medical supplies China since fucked everyone over

Also good morning, how’s smog Beijing treating 8:16 lovely Thursday insult. was, me, fact. talked work out, specifically, Öresund region, Norway Finland l, also said. talked happened thus far ie strategy failing whatever else want propagate for. You’re quite similar see situation Sweden Denmark actually. 

So way solving would Sweden admit Denmark strategy along herd immunity? Denmark decides?That sounds constructive. 

Has offer helping TTI actually offered something suggested article? Also think meant test capacity trace isolate part. It’s think that’s enough? making closer samarbejde especially TTI? 16.000 commutes Denmark everyday. Imagine able set system TTI across borders. That’s along line thinking samarbejde is. 

I don’t think Sweden would problem joining European consensus one. we’re European Union. FHM, asked border openings, earlier said rather make decisions specific countries would like joint effort inside EU decided across board. agree, even would entail Sweden take precautions actions haven’t taken. It’s fair, we’re union together. pandemic it’s own. really good thing union. 

You talk Sweden. talk Öresund region. Skåne faired quite ok this, disregarding feel Swedish strategy. That’s think it’s populist policy. Also see lot interest chat DR site means people want talk it. Maybe politicians talk then? 

The longer borders going closed less happy faces there’s going I’m afraid. Anyone half brain said reopening. Funny riots, media outlets concerned. Hmmmmm Boris Johnson lockdown They’re not. Plus, there’s whole crop fresh 21 year olds stuck inside three months waiting party haven’t even schooled bar etiquette yet. It’s wild there. Stay safe, friends.

Oh, AND, husband, (bartender), said wrong sneeze cough next thing knows people ready throw fuck down. That’s “grown ups”, too. Like, you’re going fight someone sneezing vicinity perhaps shouldn’t going out. like lipsticks. hide mask. summer. rights! keep Brits He's prime minister, he's premier rednecks talk much 'common sense' (as opposed 'book smarts') wear mask rampant disease spread people's breath. thoughts exactly. must refer anyone department stores . early February confirmed recently antibody test. definitely possible still antibodies contracting January, assuming did, lot depends individual physiology. God damn, I'm Ohio paying almost much 2 bedroom, instead trash pickup one overflowing dumpster every 20 units surrounded broken glass, broken washer dryer closet second floor, pest control holes foundation pests routinely enter, instead gated complex we've got nice perimeter empty Twisted Tea cans around parking lot. Exactly. 

We've 1 death Australia last week. Unfortunately many people Surprise think it’s scam back 100%. went Frys day, maybe 4 us total masks. It’s insane. Yes, France 458 new cases today Brazil 32,000, 19% total cases single day, deaths lag behind, check Brazil's logarithmic case growth compare France. throwback KG Oura Ring shit'll hot fire. early February confirmed recently antibody test. definitely possible. read somewhere assholes actually spread covid farther non woke socially people. make sure sniff ass walks away. least Lupus patients able get drug cheaper, now. Right? make $200k year $4-5k month mortgage/rent isn’t lot. It’s relative. Plus LCL areas don’t prevalent 6 figure jobs. it’s important understand salary along location. Thank you!! 

Congrats promotion, that’s awesome!!! I’m gonna creep bit since I’m nosey gal 🤣🤣🤣 $600 1300sqft house here. 3br 2 bath spacious yard. Landlord pays water takes trash, yard work. Appliances furnished, repairs done landlord. U.S. meat processors slaughtered millions pigs March could sell meat moment time willing foot bill keep pigs alive quarantine done. People little regard animal life absolutely kill cows ""too expensive"" maintain. That's fucked up. CA really increased much. Look percent positive % state. TX FL trending up. AZ really bad.. think idea poverty line hasn’t moved $30k/yr yet another example politicians disassociated society can’t possibly represent it.

Just that’s made make possible everyone. many different situations impossible encompass policy. 

Stop marooning unfortunate, uneducated, mentally ill, destitute. Food, shelter, health, community non-negotiable requirements human life. It’s doesn’t matter much cost. fact would deny ANYONE pinnacle hypocrisy.  recording recoveries really something public health departments capable developed country; vital information testing effectiveness vaccine cases China? challenge trials purposely infecting people? Otherwise seems like amount infection China low get kind antibody response Nice graph, aside fact three combined half US population nearly number deaths. Essentially pick states comparison. 
Bars restaurants, believe undoubtedly contributing, protests. real excuse bars opinion, that's state decision. Oddly seem concerned wearing masks others. glad old senile Gropy Joe charge. thinks travel restrictions xenophobic, fearmongering hysteria. west move shit shut plants, try stopping them, see happens

Because moving shit shutting production like leaving girlfriend, pack suitcase crash friend's couch??? Free medicine lupus patients numerous people knowledgeable subject said would fly situation today. Why? treatments bulk diseases. Pretty sure ""Great Recession"" housing Great Depression. Honestly deflation would wonderful right now, given much savings depreciated value years. used able bottle soda machine quarter. dollar. Costs quadrupled places, wages? wish. squeeze definitely felt everywhere. burn baby burn! disco inferno! Let virus decide needs mask. COVID virus wants everyone know masks needed, open businesses, like flu, best remedy covid go work tough out. COVID virus really smart. Oh lord. 657 positive 983 tested particular plant. 

Also: several outbreaks German slaughterhouses recent weeks, prompting government impose stricter safety rules industry ban practice using sub-contractors.

Time time we're seeing slaughterhouses create perfect conditions virus spread. would link youtube video documenting this, clean kitchen record it. really. Consider common $100k job. aren’t LCL locations. Strange, land prices gone up, although projected drop. looking place retire 'small house'. far plot New Mexico looking options. It’s interesting Xi Jinping kept emphasizing Chinese people escaped poverty become middle class.

However, Prime Minister Li Keqiang said China still 600 million people monthly income less 1,000 yuan. whatever say dear think part issue it’s often cheaper rent apartment living dorms, also student loans used rent. paying $2000 month crazy, feel like lot people look another cost they’ll (try to) pay back later.  Mask on, Mask (when seated)? Seems reasonable people still object, unless ""sell"" sort Karate Training. I'm New Jersey. Honestly 100% people wearing mask here. Guess we've already seen serious get. mean, mine go $50 last year. year change. either deep denial predictive ability financial epidemiologic models, understand even tiniest details certainty, accuracy vs. consistency

Reliability validity much important concerns social sciences. Hayek would certainly like word economics well. 

I think confusing theoretical frameworks statistical modeling. It’s bad seems like bargain Rofl China neither gives shit US, to. incompetence liar moron sits White House caused shit here. Wow thank you, know that! Lol made creep history 😂😂 congrats

I'm well, got promotion recently I'm little busier, got subs well (enjoy snooping) mostly chatting discord servers trying get back normal vegan, confirm, animal testing.  long remove DeSantis office? I'm thinking going hiking friend two sometime next week two, usually meet somewhere way carpool trailhead since parking limited places. risk 20-25 minute car ride windows cracked whole time seems pretty low, missing anything there? see they'd willing wear masks car, feel like keeping windows freeway make really hard virus transmission happen anyway.  2.5 million May, came totally blue: replace fast lost them, still see dramatic decrease unemployment Summer. Wall Street calling ""Flash Recession"". Lots positive news past month. got right, plenty middle aged also. 
For matter fact seen, worst!. Yet true nonetheless wish landlord. sigh This. People usually thinks people like nurses doctors way ""smarter"" rest us battle... truth there's lot stupid people too. someone lawyer mean he/she smart. saw nurse family saying 'i want wear mask public transport"" ok. Just...ok. can't speak New York City, upstate New York mask usage definitely near 30-40% range. Yeah, they're ones WIC, secret they're hypocrites. Lol. rent go $100 Maybe rename virus New Polio people better understand mangling that’s going on... many people think it’s flu. Self loathing narcissist? thing? think $600 week unemployment proves government knows amount necessary keep family afloat. probably first time families worry paying rent time. newsbreak.com may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Told you... three weeks ago knew going case people Alabama dumb refusing wear masks!

That moronic. Wearing mask pair wraparound safety glasses makes pretty much going get coronavirus unless someone rips mask coughs face. Brazil health minister month. first one fired, second one resigned replaced. Yes, month. though Tuskegee experiments obvious time. God forbid we're going start living better lifestyles! Eating less shit foods/fast food, less drinking alcohol and, less smoking compensate corona virus deaths! Actually Covid killed people police US... idiots moved Modern Warfare lobby. Damn E-Thugs! long time. America fucking loves Corona  maybe something don't...common sense. Don’t F**k Cats. Here's tip: put phone airplane mode paywall pops up, cancel &amp; view article free. government plan zombies pandemic... That's math works exact situation 3 years ago. made $10k year mom making nothing. felt need stay. made move, somewhat will, LA suburbs Bay Area. best worst thing could done. 

It took till 27 make move get it. Wait see downturn plays consider moving sake. Unsurprising. Mom's I'm sure. 33 year old friend never moved out. You’re right, ReOpen protestors boogaloos don’t wear  still decent sized loan amount purchase. Refi way. Lenders turning people away cause cant handle volume. Refi volume 160%. Everything backlogged. blame them? cult leader sets example Right - they’ll go make ‘next’ place unaffordable well, exactly like happened cities. may benefit WFH workers, it’s whole net negative people already live areas move to.

We need build meet demand likely need abolish heavily alter zoning laws order (and need accept reality growing population increases price land, accordingly price housing). Lol yup. TX follow, NC somewhere mix believe FL well. Basically every state that’s reporting new daily high cases plans hosting rally near future Montana enormous error bar though, lower cases harder get handle Rt. I'm sure math behind Yeah lot people putting eggs ""MASKS!"" strategy seem realize Midwest mask wearing already low coming close totally non-existent numbers (MN, IN, WI, OH) keep going down.

These mutli-faceted issues.

Since state supreme court stripped governor's restrictions WI's numbers went ......down.

IN aggressive since opening. began re-open hospitalizations near peak.......7 weeks later hospitalizations half.


It's easy say ""Look state re-opened numbers went up"" ""That state wears mask numbers went down!""


That good explain dozen states aggressively re-opened, low mask usage, numbers keep going down?

You explain too. feels abit pointless certain people decide free time worth someone else dieing. they've always way, tripping giant PC feet Yeah actually is. What's adequate salary work target ? Thank you. That's really good advice!  Perks living ""cool"" place. Money goes hell lot wild entire comment section rich people trying say rich. sure, millionaires billionaires way rich*er* someone barely falls top 25%, people called ""rich."" Still pos, comments law enforcement luxury staying home, next sentence says got campaign event held.

You definitely luxury holding campaign events, buddy. says violate order though. allowed leave. Disease resistant specific strain coronavirus. Trust good thing perspective. 

More likely allow virus replicate many times many needless cases, increasing probability terrifying mutations like happened Spanish flu. First wave killed thousands, let spread much recombined mutated, subsequent waves killed tens millions. want play word games you. Xi Jinping said ""全面建设小康社会"" Chinese. ""全面"" translated ""Comprehensively"" English. Chinese, means ""全部"" ""all"".  u/Practical-Chart sorry hear cousin, glad he's better. How'd get it? Traveling? Contact positive person?

u/Tecashine agree extent man, trust get coming from. know people think nbd stories like seeing multiple young people (in 20's) hooked vents scary. Sure, made thank God, even endure young age scary.

Also, sure take corona i'm assuming think bid deal, probably wear masks time... assumption (could completely wrong) know people extra preventative measures. people actually causing spread... unknowingly sure, ignorance sure is.

An interesting read: Read group 12 girls ended going bar days ago FL opened up... got sick. luck! Ego. unlucky get Spam? I'm American I've still never tried it. third word said  He's one AZ next week. Hey Arnold, also work golds even though I’m 25, I’m technically risk due previous cardiac injury. I’ve worn mask every day I’ve back golds (2 now) agree, it’s kind dismaying see many people wearing masks, working not. Might follow lead stick pull ups dips.  rest country is. rest states borders closed Victoria less still limit spread.  Everything positive they've instituted crisis come Labor party. LNP using pandemic cover tonnes shady shit entrench class warfare.

I hope people see that.. right, wont cuz Murdoch. got Frontline, Essential, Work home. need degree VIRUSES WEATHER know operate! Ok first, I'm saying masks worn.


But...

This report criticised heavily many scientific community called retracted. statistical work total joke. Apparently reports writers chose peer reviewers.

Here response John Hopkins: Hey fellow garden stater. Yes! 2nd worst hit state lowest transmission rate. Let's hope keep way. There’s Facebook page town Florida vacation (not year) there’s one two people post state data covid attacked horribly locals. locals call liars, denying severity deaths occurring want banned. people attacked posting info State Florida. It’s mind blowing! says Montana worst, look cases trends. There’s indication it’s worse state USA. fact CDC recognized one best states handle pandemic. RemindMe! October 1 want leave beijing air right need test report showing virus free. foolproof alot avoid spread outside city. 

If somehow manage take train likely get yellow code whereever arrive required go isolation. 

I know neither pieces information click you. worth, done something sensible avoid spread described situation publicly ""extremely grave"". Lmao troll post? It’s happening now. Hospitals full turning away patients now.

There cities country zero hospital capacity due CoVID19 patients sent hours away.

We incredibly effective socially distancing early in, people grown bored precautions largely returned normalcy, providing chain infection rip cities, counties, states nothing done abate spread.

I’d still say 119,941 deaths tragic. that’s speaking nothing sequela haunt many never full recover infection.

It’s foolish count chickens hatch. tested 1/3 study spain population billion half ye xd  Honestly glad. Feels like governors won’t take masks seriously till they’ve become infected themselves.   number every hospital denies care everyone early say that. I’ve inside. They’re empty. [i can't figure got  look daily infections (worldmeter) France Brazil start see difference. Brazil blowing up. France took seriously, Brazil said ""Real men get Rona"". stupid conversation Maybe don’t blame young people allow bars open. Didn’t think so. Good day . pretty well. find site useful quick glance see state going. Indeed article say anything enforced wearing...just given out. Corona getting started. virus remains novel .. winter coming. hilarious can’t stop laughing. Keep Lol, ploy. China desperately trying replicate US research labs years, yet. US recently caught Chinese military officer trying leave country complete layout plans research lab spaces University California. ploy is, drive nations succeed steal it. Definitely hoax. /s
Better go look inside hospitals sure... driving seeing it. said Covid numbers astronomical? Yet aren't. Wonder what's that? latest distraction easily manipulated dumb fucks. got control already, impressive Plus ratios. need 1 nurse per x amount patients 1 cna/pct per amount patients. half staff sick can't kick residents. still need care. America feel federal government brought military help fill positions. tend agree numbers potentially covid deaths recorded pneumonia. also think could go way. Also something think fact novel respiratory disease burning population... immune systems compromised pneumonia would also issue. office staff, clearly, pedant. raises point tenants decide it’s worth move

there's vast chasm raising rent rarely enough cover increasing expenses. great tenant loss still loss unless counting solely equity appreciating.

it apparently works OP increase rents tenants, great. realized terrible is. I'm glad live small dog. Lol...I write ""at least""... are. got notice today, tips get last year's rate. say rent going one hundred. article talks areas dropping prices little 6%. call pandemic pricing. I'd say that's tip iceberg needs happen rent return sane levels. food problem, customers gonna around you. work restaurants tell people disgusting shit would believe pretty much constantly. get handed snotty tissues, dirty diapers, money wet saliva regular. watch people sneeze cough open air 50% time rest cover mouth hand. watch customers walk bathroom without washing hands. would believe rarely refill hand soap. things things transmit covid, say lot peoples overall hygeine little trust give hint shit. ""Comprehensively"" Note article doesn’t mention ‘sick’ COVID. says tested COVID meeting would take place. Yeah wish could nice apt 2200. Unlikely. say country, I’m referring whole United States country meaning rural parts. Specifically rural parts Ohio live in. Spelled like airport? hey - wear masks crack windows. 

Aerosols accumulate car long period i.e. higher viral load time likely high risk. windows cracked, masks would necessary would still wear safe (you never know someone might talking loudly droplet two land mouth/nose)

So keep windows cracked, wear masks enjoy hike. Man stay home thing really fucked sense time. realize almost July. feels like may still. India young population, 65% population 35. people gotten disease recovered without needing go hospital getting test. actual prevalence number cases therefore 100 200 times official number! Wages somewhat different compared are. Well machine Nah lol wonder insurance companies run liquidity this. tax payers might bail out. agree you, little sympathy. think big deal got it, even bragged shaking hands Corona patients. still implementing policies stem virus fast thick enough late. Getting virus turning point many though Nobody could seen coming area, growth driving home values property taxes retired people driven out. I've felt time property taxes cease 20 years ownership person. would reward folks stayed around community promote longer term ownership.

Edit: would also accept 30 years, length average mortgage term. recall, fulfillment timeframe quite low people. Outside Harrisburg, PA. $1250/mo 3 floor 5 bedroom duplex small backyard 2 car garage garage. 10min drive state capital traffic. 1hr45min Philadelphia. 1 hour Baltimore. international border article talking controlled federal government state. mIlLeNiALs kIlLiNg BoOmErS

I’m okay this. Pennsylvanias economy responding better states mention? Article available UK. Half joy living place like San Fran able delicately work fact live San Fran every conversation social gatherings elsewhere. That’s fair, guys home cooking using utilities way due covid. Welcome, new here? working since started, see one caring. masks, social distancing... welcome nightmare. results need replicated independently, that’s part process. Incredible they’ve managed it. 

No one scrutiny here. Depomedrol, kenalog prednisone. 3 month dose depomedrol wears 3 days kenalog gives month long period ends right benefits wear off. Dmards mtx, plaquenil arava (sulpha allergy cannot even try sulphasalazine) pulled side effects. Enbrel, orencia, kevzara, rituxan, cimzia (current I'm starting struggle, year one longer lasting me). Meloxicam duloxetine pulled never ending headaches. Le sigh, always, hope next one works well longer year. :) think UK even enough early on. Action effective, well way full recovery, borris fucked lot early on. However everyone pretty much page beat virus. actually spring training. absolutly right...that's gold. China Xi never said escaped poverty. also Chinese people gray income subject tax. 600m questionable still quite lot western China poor. Lol you’re loser Jist wear masks car. make transmission nearly impossible. Almost guaranteed safety area, nobody building smaller affordable housing anymore. least last 10 years. Every new apartment building soulless prefabricated hipster looking places go $1,300 month 600 square-foot unit homes 4000 square foot monstrosity going least $750,000 piece. nuts. Wtf. way many preschools US well many grade schools around world. teachers family frustrated means even short lunch break taken them, gross eating ""IN CLASSROOM""? different eating living room office? think California 2k more. 2 effing grand. Oh wow, molte grazie really wonderful answer! greatly appreciate time put it. guess thought use serological tests well enough. quite hard understand look new cases. Everything put right direction good thing. contact tracing app, mass blood testing etc.

really helped clarify me, thank you! make sense way, makes bit hopeful Sweden made ok call budgeting lot antibody tests. was.... Suspicious Sweden allocating much money antibody tests since Nordics relied primarily PCR AFAIK, hey guys huge success story antibody tests precedent working! makes feel much better. 

It's amazing region made masks mandatory *and* gave free masks! fantastic. whole thing really heartwarming success story overall! happy all. *love* Italy great hear taking rational, decisive measures things going well. read people saying countries ""follow sweden"" ""talk little action"" ""lockdowns work"".

I know just... Annoying. Talking often like banging head wall. feel like narrative getting less less prominent time becomes obvious Sweden worst country EU right metrics: Maybe UK worse ways, internationally Brazil topping rolling 7 day average deaths per million that's credit strategy. 

FWIW convinced point, weeks interacting (and taking lot abuse them, studying accounts / discourse patterns abusive closely), LOT accounts rabidly pro-Swedish strategy *probably* inorganic. Dunno sure ofc, happening who's behind it, many fit pattern uncanny: There's also evidence various corporate interests funding anti-lockdown voices: think genuine probably, though, that's gets really frustrating! wild people double what's obviously failed strategy *so many* variations masks and/or TTI success stories there. hey, SE pivoting towards TTI *think* hopefully frustrating era coming close soonish.

Anyway buona notte (it's getting late, log off) *molte* grazie thorough explanation! That’s actually point. Adding salary makes things relative. Spending habits, debt, etc huge factors influence comfortable rent mortgage is. Better leave bare let reader fill situation, least opinion.

I totally agree point though, $500 2bd 2ba sounds sweet realize they’ll pay 2x job major city, might make serious sacrifices terms quality location. Also people months WFH willing pay nicer places, pay move farther away.

I’d bet prices going places like Napa Santa Cruz right now. I've concerned with. beginning covid stuff, upset politicized, like truly horrified reality it. Fast forward months, I’m still pissed state surprise horror dulled exists background mind small voice, “this isn’t right....” 

I’ve grown used it. complacency ability adapt perceived horrific *few* months ago... 

Well, something said soul crushing, must it. politicization pandemic soul crushing. maybe that’s considered end game some. definitely higher Oh no. want think coronavirus version chicken pox/shingles might look feel like... race made easier invented fucking thing begin with. Brazil testing sh\*t. Salt Lake city. paid 1800 2 bedroom 2 bath 1000sq ft 5 years ago bought house.

Edit: Sorry. Harvard take account powerful weapon, denial. Sucks US only. Social media comments reflect public opinion. half social media accounts fake. half ones aren’t fake trolls trying get reaction. many fake ones foreign governments deliberately trying sow division. 

This deliberate strategy weaken democracies. Countries like Russia China want us hate make seem like it’s either one opinion other. Don’t fall trap. Northeast, Great Lakes region, Coastal California _generally_ value community benefit willing place individual desires. regions US place greater emphasis personal freedom desires community.

The former regions generally better mask-wearing. latter areas generally worse.

There exceptions. Conservative areas former states seem generally worse overall wearing masks, liberal areas generally better. don’t get idea transmission rate linked. says it’s 1.0 stop spreading. Plenty states 1.0 time, still see cases hundreds. Doesn’t mean it’s spreading? weird hand turn since Facebook spent millions building campus. “design” forward companies understand value co-location. Yet quick turn corner. imagine it’s way save tremendous amounts money. company talking 50% current office space utilized going forward. totally agree. family always cohabitate parents, grandparents, cousins. it’s normal don’t understand people push kids 18 get house ASAP. It’s arbitrary. without us even ask. I’ve seen lot move-outs, probably why.  wonder theses Chinese scientists also perfected vaccines Lyme Disease HIV yet? Developing safe effective vaccine sprint, marathon, unless want kill significant number runners. happens lot near colleges. least experience. never took one deals usually worth it, sooo common. Fucking Americans Where??? Um no.... like drunk driving....

Not driving drunk requires drinking drive(IE reasonable burden doesn’t deprive one civil liberties) require foregoing leaving house foregoing facets regular life like permanent stay home would people like seem asking for...

Like said, feel free fear monger home rest life, fact matter viruses naturally come contact almost everyone sooner later... Boy. sure hope landlord gets memo. problem deflation create ""doom loop"" nobody buy anything want hold gets cheaper future. Nobody buying anything causes prices drop even further. causes companies go business, people get laid off, etc... etc... little bit inflation actually good something government actively tries create monetary policy. fucking disagreeing comment responding to. Jesus Fucking Christ, dense.

""Some random internet comment said it, let's take axiomatic"" fucking dumb way go life. “Fuck” anonymous Even Phoenix New Times, ranked city Maricopa County, noted name ""awful"", put con. Louisiana implement checkpoints state boarder like Texas months back. definitely hit early Europe, 12 days UK. They're pretty much tied Spain UK, 900 excess deaths per million, Belgium 800, countries come close.

To fair population density lot it, Italy also high median age. opinion US handling virus way worse, it'll probably months get close deaths per million. Surgical masks N95s option. bother comparing them?

Show study efficiency mask percentage people wearing effect r value. Thank Arnold! Please let get started shit again. Many people around permanent work home. longer bound commute times, moving away cities cheaper, bigger houses. facility well within rights transfer resident different facility contact NYS department health say need help, can't take care resident (because enough staff example). Cuomo actively encouraging this, said State either move residents hotels take care, appoint receiver take running facility completely.

It seems plan work well everyone  
  CEO hard-hit Brooklyn nursing home, 55 patients died coronavirus, told Post last week he’d warning state Health Department officials weeks staffing equipment issues — yet received little help.   “There way us prevent spread conditions,’’ head Cobble Hill Health Center, Donny Tuchman, wrote e-mail department April 8.   said asked move patients makeshift wards Manhattan’s Javits Center aboard city-docked USNS Comfort amid pandemic, told two spots receiving patients hospitals.  
“I made specific requests transfer patients, didn’t happen,’’ Tuchman told Post. “There weren’t options.”


Even worked perfectly everyone, I'm sure would helped much. Unless facilities able isolate residents COVID-19 wards dedicate staff specifically places workers spreading virus healthy patients go room room. Keeping residents apart easy, keeping virus limited specific areas within healthcare facility not. make vaccine!! blackjack hookers! aren't. They're still high fuck. Even went 30%, would high. that? location? areas lack something expensive areas offer?  shit.  true getting final stages point good news, guarentee anything vaccines hitting stage making progress hope vaccine year early next year. Swedish authorities advocating social distancing since start spread Netherlands seems pretty well getting Corona control, hardly masks public spaces without strict lockdown. need see evidence masks.

I’m glad didn’t post belief it’s pure garbage. recorded 1,269 additional COVID-19 deaths Wednesday, bringing official death toll novel coronavirus 46,510, world outside United Health Ministry also registered 32,188 new cases virus since Tuesday update, total 955,377 confirmed cases, also second United States globally. Thank continuing post TWiVs here! great podcast, really everyone interest science behind COVID listen it. listened ep yet, sure brilliant like rest. ""generalizing people""?

On side note think companies donated drug stockpile. Hardly getting rich that. DELETE FACEBOOK PEOPLE. study used mortality statistics end April. current study available concludes thing? 

Also, using mortality numbers states around US right suspect endeavor. growing understanding many Covid-19 deaths mislabeled pneumonia deaths completely unrelated Covid-19. 

According statistics provided CDC: IL, FL, TX, AZ 200-300% yearly average pneumonia deaths (yearly average based five-year average) first six months 2020. likelihood states experience 500-600% excess deaths (excess deaths deaths yearly average) pneumonia years-end explanation why. 

Note: four states listed ones mislabeling deaths seems issue across board.

If excess deaths added Covid-19 statistics, would likely paint much bleaker picture overall mortality rate virus. view another building though. want see something? costs extra. So, bad flu, right? normal people supposed able relate article?? $7k+ month rent? pay much whole year. California worked increasing repairing stockpile ventilators acquiring proper PPE hospitals. California even loaned stockpile states needed it. even setup pop hospital sights help surge capacity. Plan infrastructure place places.  Ugh terrifying. sister 99,9% covid feb-april antibody test June - showed negative antibodies, looking promising flu season comes back. compare fellow neighbor’s numbers? real answer question probably need long-term data. Right now, states opening faster pace likely greater economic activity. consequence pace reintroduction restrictions order combat serious spike cases hospitalizations, PA’s slow-and-steady approach might pay off. turns quicker reopening managed without straining healthcare systems, PA’s economic recovery may lag behind time.

It’s choice it’s tough know what, if, right decision. I’m certainly glad don’t one making it. Wanton, like things soup. Love em here. sure trust guys making though. Surprise! Arizona! Sweden screwed Yeah, well city one bedroom averages $3,200 know people rent raised $900 sudden. increase talking seems like rounding error. Thank much input. decided going weekend see her. think guilt would eat inside didn't. I'll take extra precautions I'm around quarantine get back home. left-hand graph shows confirmed cases, since Sweden testing enough, sharp increase testing also results sharp increase confirmed cases. measure actual cases.

The right-hand graph shows total deaths, course always increasing everyone.

Neither graphs show week week deaths. graph shows daily deaths death date: completely obvious anyone looking graph death rate reached peak early April, declining since. rising, claim, steady, others claim. declining. going down. Every day, fewer fewer people die covid-19 Sweden, every European country.

Here's another graph containing rolling 7-day average reported deaths, comparing Sweden European countries: (It also shows death rate Sweden going down) delusion still people fb feed actually believe American numbers inflated make look worse really lol like really? definitely boomers, young parents, young kids incompetent parents. generation I'm see shocked millennials. care people swear protect. simple that.

That still explain slews states opened even aggressively AZ, mask wearing, numbers continued decline.

How come TX AZ re-open numbers go 6 weeks later MO, IN, WI re-open even faster, aggressively, higher amount virus already circulation 6 weeks later numbers either declining (WI) bordering plummeting (IN)? Here’s glimmer Wu Yingsong, director antibody engineering research Southern Medical University Guangzhou, said Wuhan study treated caution. noted antibody tests checked couple antibodies save time cost – could mean false results. might see household income rich, that’s snapshot year.

It’s phenomenal amount money make monthly physician engineer, could imagined boy.

But doesn’t feel rich.

And it’s like live paycheck paycheck like one author years back talking hard live hundreds thousands year. save great deal net income, know that’s privilege, none feels rich.

Not asking pity trying win internet points, trying bit honesty doesn’t matter. Assuming going campsite there's people backcountry (Since mention toilets) - That's really biggest danger see there, assuming meeting campers.

I'm quite camping trips year - best thing get away world - Prepping food, staying far away world, enjoying nature, nothing idiotic it.

You sound like safe everything honestly, might little *too* safe since highly doubt interacting anyone campsites - many provincial parks backcountry sites might see check staff occasional ranger. Plus, one wants wear mask canoeing, portaging hiking wilderness. I'm thinking seriously. know it'd better financial move. However, parents bad health (60+ diabetics health problems overweight), large part want leave lose change spend time them. also little brother who's 19 struggling, want role model involved life. need better job fulfillment life, also want help care about. I'm 23 though, suppose time work out. degree soon key industry certification. I'm goal job great city age 30, I'll happy.

What downsides move? Please get tested. numbers need go every single case going anything &amp; think bad is. Imagine everyone even mild symptoms got tested &amp; even 10% positive. numbers would rise astronomically. MAYBE something would done. think weird either. tbought sarcastic comments first, tbh mind you, 'according china' stats prolly wack Imagine good could’ve USA government cared more. feels like government thinks it’s going go away it’s not, it’s getting worse they’re watching unfold. Got it. Honestly may mild case feel 95%. things really affecting losses feel slowly coming back slightly drowsy feels like sleep day keep active. hopefully sooner later I’ll back feet Yeah gonna ugly. Even shut things right theres still 2 weeks exponential growth come, cant imagine look like August live it’s hot fucking humid it’s miserable. It’s absolute worst time year come central Florida unless like mosquitoes face butt sweat. give week fists fly. Well, use protecting city anymore I've already gotten it. get covid shower? would take court got sick there. Set example, even lost. hid virus order get head start going send strongly worded letter. Acting today already late. virus 2-week lag see impact infections hospitalisations. spit public too? Trump's favorite puppet  city hospitals full patients stuck without medical treatment? whisked away another city ambulance, actually left die? Well least got make cute Rubicon reference. #facepalm sad part really looks like beijing handling well, almost like learned something. 

Putting aside obvious (and actually important) stuff like mass testing imposing strict lockdowns high risk areas soft lock rest city. canceled huge number flights, mandated outbound passengers provide proof virus free. They've sent undeniably clear message outbreak dangerous calling extremely grave. 

This time around easy target blame. mean, found met President, required tested. live outside Philly (PA) it’s here. We’ve lower cases I’m holding breath see fewer fewer wear masks socially distance.  renters paid $4900 month place that’s local average $5400....Jesus overfunded, deceitful, common sense. People really think they’re never going get corona 😂 What’s research transmission outdoor spaces? 

I road trip next month planned camping night cooking/bringing food. planned activities outdoors plan wear mask social distance around others. indoor spaces foresee spending extended periods time grocery stores (if run low food) public restrooms. experienced hiker/camper pretty self sufficient trip. 

It seems biggest risk would public toilets since COVID-19 found fecal matter, research suggested primarily flushing toilets spreads virus. anticipate toilets campgrounds vault style less trafficked normal public restrooms I’m sure big danger COVID would them.

Looking buy Bay Area even drop, California always rise matter what. seem alot people previously thought. think February UK government soo bad. still awaiting antibodies test places world turn New York situation. need massive density massive public transport.  That's going happen Orlando.

The situation trending worse, keep mind millions New Yorkers infected tested March/April. takes quite bit create explosion, abundance testing capacity naturally blunt growth. take once, never get sick against!

Wearing masks something do, know work. Social distancing also helpful, extent it, always possible. may also things do. figure things are, also start them. Welp. Agreed! I’m also CT go today. one point looked around everyone could see wearing mask- including small child statue. Went grocery store garden center saw maybe two three people without masks.

turned implies Oh sure, I'm trying make political statement -- seen lot protesters without masks.

I understand relaxed approach right leaning city/state govs. going sitting crisis soon enough. think also misunderstanding ""mild"" entails.

Mild sniffles. Mild includes everything pneumonia requiring supplemental oxygen.

The word ""mild"" used loosely, IMO, beginning this. Pneumonia requiring oxygen vs. requiring oxygen may medical delineation mild severe think many lay people heard mild thought, ""Okay, like bad cold?"" Exponential growth. Duh. stores won’t let aren’t wearing mask... It’s strictly enforced LI (like fine dont) like world’s shittiest game Russian Roulette

Good analogy.

83% people play Russian Roulette live.

For young healthy sure among 80% get COVID mild symptoms: load one round revolver, spin it, pull trigger?

Are fundraisers already?

Is UNICEF territory? I'm happy he's rallies again. people want vote sake vanity he's going get killed. appropriate. U mean next 2 weeks right🙄 Yep, also LivePD number times Maybe using masks closed spaces. would it? they’re getting seriously sick dying, odds incredibly unlikely will, hell would reconsider invincibility it’s cold moderate flu them?

Like take precautions, reality 24 year old great health get (if already haven’t), I’m likely asymptomatic quite mild infection. 

Like prefer get sick don’t much yet, get sick, I’m worried Meh that's risk take.  find entertaining, killed anyone yet idk 🤷‍♂️ Thank you. appreciate that. hope better Someone planning thing clearly never Oklahoma summer.

I wish knew was... Imagine gave everyone universal health care. dumb libs would lose MINDS!!! Actually virus recovered fine. thanks wishing ill didn’t you. goes show much caring person 👌 Kinda, agree, let’s forget basically every state wasn’t bothering test anyone age range unless severely sick height March/April wave. could well similar proportion I’d Joe Rogan saying he’s full sh$t. highest percentage I’ve seen (and **just** among people 30) 40% Every Doctors office mandates masks upon entry reason. understand severity pandemic masks offer least protection. people listen doctor regarding health, can't understand people wear mask every doctor interviewed says masks limit spread disease. know, assume believe God wonder think God's will. likely they'll conveniently forget faith something bad happened them, still. Surely think ""wow, Lord punished hubris. Maybe rethink things"" spoiler alert - doesnt die survive always robot uprising, skynet. Exactly disparage ADHD folks like that, we're useful sack potatoes ever be. Haha! love stupid fuckers getting fucked right stupid butts!!!! No, that's false.

Since April 3, US residents received consistent advice federal, state, local public health officials, supported places state local government leaders, wear simple (homemade purchased) cloth masks public, especially indoors.

HOWEVER, ""anti mask movement"" emerged US, come slew emotional pseudo-scientific objections masks:

""wearing mask takes away freedom""

""masks scaredy cats, tough macho men afraid viruses""

""God want wear mask, would interfere God's decision whether get COVID""

""if wear mask, oxygen deprived suffocate""

""if wear mask, carbon dioxide build body make sick""

The anti mask movement strongest Southern states, Florida, Texas, Arizona, (southern) California. anti mask movement strong enough many places greatly reduce mask wearing rates, block adoption mandatory mask-wearing laws.

However, places mentioned experiencing big increase COVID spread, measured cases positive test rates. causing states local governments earlier rejected mask laws change minds.

For example, states Arizona Texas order effect prevented local governments enacting mandatory mask laws. governors states repealed orders today, localities Arizona Texas require mask usage public, rather saying ""mask recommended"". Ohh can’t wait People know tickets guarentee seat whatever reason. empty sets they'll filled people pay door 200 year old law he’s referring? looking two laws hand [and] going one that's 200 years old rather two days old.""

So guy also believes slavery. Interesting include deaths related lockdowns. deaths caused virus, cost mitigation. Perhaps measures would lower cost. first thought. ridiculous. also literally nothing. Nothing all, last heard, doubled nothing every opportunity. Let know dies. Oh, wait! he's 85 years old, flu. average age death higher average life expectancy anyways? I’m stating looking votes. Y’all babies comes conversation. professional organization police department. 12.4% LA today. That’s great. someone live far Tulsa, I'm staying fuck away Tulsa while. glad work home. means testing available. beginning pandemic impossible anyone 65 get test. spike comes infected super spreaders return communities. IMHO, remains seen effect protests had. find next days. got campaign event held.

he know that. probably even matter. Hes reserved million tickets event, city less half million. Although oklahoma city probably big draw, still dont see million people, even half million show up. Somebody make lot money troll thing true though.

Source: tulsan absolutely right. pathetic. Omg, start reddit campaign buy tickets 🎟 way. girl way far away hand. think major component. Hot spots. think Chinese caught onto that’s stamp hot spots aggressively. else take massive steps shutdowns cluster cases pop up? mutually exclusive. Office buildings won’t able get back normal it’s safe work them. Businesses make decisions going risk employees health full staffing office building. economy much bigger retail, restaurants bars. think, could organize massive rent strike keep driving prices they're actually reasonable again. city france except Paris live decent apartment let's say 700€ get 700sqft 2 bedroom apt surbubs connected public transport. Bahaha!! need 100% immunity everyone country stop spread least reduce slow one. goal would protect vulnerable individuals point low infection rate could easily trace like Germany first case. time vulnerable people society would exposed virus healthier. We’ve gotten used conversing 280 characters less completely lost ability problem solve. exactly expect see people assume anyone disagrees enemy... warn I'm particular hire, guys welcome apply job opened up. explain mean? largest driver cost houses (and rent) cost build new properties. Labor, materials, land cost every year. Another thought behind this: I've seen trend apartments renting lot units ""Professional AirBnB"" companies manage fleet units across multiple cities. pandemic crushed AirBnB vacationing wonder many companies backing way leasing maybe even dropping units. Maybe read thread. literally comment responding to. Texas lame. But....Columbus, Ohio.... Damn inverted cards meaning opposite! Finally action taken. statewide mandate still welcome news. many anti-maskers can’t reasoned with, anything less mandate useless. feeling pressure questioning, visibly sweating. I'm thinking driving distance. think Tiki bars, outdoors, issue unless jam packed.

I think problem offices close everything else still wind outbreaks began offices... nobody follow say anything. Beaches, bars, gyms - getting tons attention ""shaming"". Greedy, cheap, asshole employers want implement work home forcing people closed air enviroment  office get ZERO shaming media politicians. They'll never forced find solutions keep employees healthy way others are. even NYC Cuomo waffled along offices. week CA shut down, Cuomo went ""cycling workers out"" infects EVERYONE unenforceable 50% office work force, 25%, finally ran excuses CA shut down, offices closed. find comment NY public schools odd. NYC excellent public high schools anyone attend, provided score well SHSAT. Elementary/middle schools little harder, kids well tests tons gifted talented programs. Maybe perspective skewed student, parent looking schools. parents made peers parents least well. Let ask different way: shouldn’t landlord charge market rent (what tenants paying similar housing)? getting better US? continue reopening? Work frontlines pandemic. Get $200. don’t know healthcare co-pays end bet eat jiffy. Diseases animal cross-infectivity impossible eradicate. Even got point humans it, would take one bat mink reinfect person we'd going again. 

Don't think could eradicate things trying hard enough ebola still hanging around?

My point anywhere effectively eliminated able keep eradicated, even vaccine. places right mean stay way, mean waiting vaccine allow avoid deaths. It’s basic supply demand. “Across US”, mean everywhere outside California, right? moved expensive apartment giving away 1 month free, San Francisco good. I’m Dallas moving 2 months. Starting search soon hoping we’d see better prices. They’re throwing new complexes minute yet rent still insane! Well yeah, class friends. People either stupid stubborn both, don’t tell bluntly, dismiss ASAP go roam freely inside 5 million inhabitants country already sacrificed lot get Covid free. 
They deserve charged indicted. comment source OP provided care home death rates countries? would call diversionary issue, red herring posts like one I'm replying avoid logic matter completely ignoring 80,000 deaths US reasons behind those... 


**EDIT** Yep /u/logan343434 offers comment fact source hand, downvotes. Guy careful mental gymnastics seems. /s That's hopeful.. love it, cool town. drivers absolute ass tho. Right people probably think deathly afraid virus conspiracy theorists can't go enjoy nightlife, closer work ( working home), pay high rent?

Hehe. Moved country years ago, last summer considering moving back city.

I'd say made right move staying :) country entertainment stuff like BBQ sunbathing garden walks forest still running.  pay 1250 two bedroom 2 bath suburbs Portland. *A San Diegan entered chat.* pretty obvious looking map SLO going next place get hit. 

I really think Newsom require county certain amount hospitalizations (say 4 5 per 100K people) wear masks. even understand would controversial since effect economy one iota. Agreed. end federal unemployment think bottom really drops out. tag this, stated NY roughly 3K daily cases around March 20. time reporting 30 ish deaths day. Obviously population density NYC makes unique case population centers states record daily cases better guard. Yea right, stupid. Facebook Instagram read all.... ohhhhh shiiit 700sqft $2400 SF? That's good value! older family member go way rig seatbelt doesnt ring doesnt put on. spends time would putting on..

Guess feels masks Always personal insults ""you x kinda guy"" you. Stop. stop. though. abusive relationship we've got going tbh: frequently abusive, frequently put abuse. 

Anyway: go here? Sweden gets act together, builds functional TTI infrastructure, gets infection burden down, gets keeps death toll *everyone* super happy. 

This article posted details: even ends saying Norway Denmark would willing help Sweden TTI. that's Nordisk samarbejde you.

Businesses suffering true. direct result Sweden's poor choice herd immunity strategy early month stubbornly clung to. still *says* done nothing wrong, thankfully least also saying needs change. Can't admit failure all. 

Borders reopen, everyone's delight, infection burden Sweden similar infection burden neighbors. Simple. also rec EU CDC; countries *similar infection pressures* reopen other: reopen borders, Sweden needs rejoin Nordic, European International consensus start behaving like beginning pursuing herd immunity longer. not, demand, possible talk reopening without talking strategy since strategy whole reason borders closed. saying ""populism"" like many cried ""racism"" countries wanted keep borders closed China. either thing, pure pragmatism. 

A quick skim report clearly, incontrovertibly demonstrates right EU, Sweden worst infection pressure. fact reflected many countries bar Swedes entering. cooperation border regions going waste due ""populism"" rather yet another casualty Sweden's awful herd immunity strategy. Sweden course corrects, we'll happy see beautiful (by COVID-free) faces wherever Europe. you’re Texas everyone ignores virus acts like things normal guess learned inflation? exact people wondering virus got politicized first place.

DeSantis says anything related Coronavirus, matter right wrong, chant ""tRuMp bAd"" ""desantis says hAiL tRuMp""

Shame every single one you. im lost real number.

texas dashboard shows 96335. 

worldometers 98,962

the site linked ( use lot) 97450. Man. wish rent dropped here. can’t find anything cheaper 700. $2400 still expensive rent someone earning 100K.

Seems prudent find cheaper place 2-3 years put difference toward downpayment. really sad need travel doctor nurse you’re capacity.

If major metro area need increase capacity going get full use extra doctor nurse.

If you’re rural need increase capacity going able use extra capacity effectively.

So doctors nurses spread throughout country singles spread efficiency drops.

It’s reason army could build 5000 bed hospital NYC can’t build 50 100 bed hospitals throughout country, doesn’t scale like that.

And deaths lag cases, new cases hitting time highs what, 16 states week?

That’s ton demand.

And twice many active infections today mid April. Thank you, say situation temporary people start taking seriously.  I'm healthcare work, go groceries even people wearing masks.  SHH! You’ll ruin marketers I'm city new apartments building built. 3 bedroom going $6600 month shitload empty luxury apartments designed attract foreign buildings instead made attract working middle class tenants/owners would helped lot. offered thought months ago told dumb idea. could work remote 100% would find super cheap place land middle nowhere. Hold mask... FDA makes guidelines. FDA employs scientists. 

Do know guidelines all, think do? learn Netflix documentary sensationalistic website, actually read precise wording CFR? 

You’re talking pharma reps now, conversation physicians. 

So frustrating many people read watch one biased thing, decide like hating Big Bad Pharma, never bother seek objective information. 

You ask pharma rep someday think FDA guidelines. Really, should! tell think “written lobbyists.” FDA doesn’t give fuck pharma. one single fuck. Read prescribing information one drug. Look it’s ordered- prescribing specifications/limits, dosing, contraindications, safety warnings, safety warnings, safety warnings. maybe 33 PAGES, maybe 1 SENTENCE saying, careful wording chosen FDA, “ drug met trial endpoint”. Tell running show pharma disclose 33 pages worth negative info saying 5 words drug working. know whose best interest that’s in? Pharma’s?? Nope. PATIENTS’. that’s FDA’s priority, regardless YouTube conspiracy theorists told you. 

This area expertise mine, mentioned. But, sure, know me. Uh huh. search, find...no problem 😬
That looks like perfect political plan 🤪 Madrid, Bergamo, NYC decided lockdown **for reason.**

??

You're strawmanning dude - I'm out. glad hear morning border would closed another month. I'm montreal, worst hit city country, finally 200 cases day, border opens shit go bad again. Never doubt brazilians comes race. Yes. small property management company, really good website/portal, done email text, phone call lengthy discussion.

Honestly, though, I've probably communicate manager probably two three times year? Usually maintenance requests notification tenant leaving, whatnot. Probably depends rental market. pretty high demand place property management company diligent getting good tenants, I've issues yet (knocks wood). That's common theme time renting here. Portland Maine? Portland Oregon?  *surprised Pikachu face* Amusing. no. leaders pretended thing would disappear summer arrived despite copious evidence contrary.  pretend vanquished look distract media. 

Let’s hope doesn’t mutate start killing younger healthier people. 70% hospital capacity currently occupied, that's hospitalizations, covid. need empty traffic immediately, trend definitely shows continue increases foreseeable future. Time cancel elective procedures week ago. Meanwhile, prices single family homes skyrocketed First it’ll hit surprise, move Sun City iterations, el mirage , on. surprise started huge population retired rich white people?  lie indeed frighten everybody high heaven? Maybe people would've taken seriously, stayed home, less spread, lives saved etc...?? theory put lot chiropractors less legit medical professionals. debunked. guy another thread told virus’s don’t exist proof youtube video. Scared go outside? 

I mean many cities US doesn’t seem like case anymore. perhaps sizeable amount people either money saved steady income working home keeping demand stable? never Lupus one highest per-capita death rates COVID world. worse US. They're 5th among countries 100k people (so excluding San Marino Andorra).

And unlike Spain Italy, them, number cases Sweden keeps increasing.

5,000 people Sweden died, small country. That's bigger disaster 9/11 here. favorite childhood game wack mole. whack? Either way hacking, whacking, smacking. Nope. American dream nightmare. Funny thing is, i've never even mentioned CCP once. First all, wetmarket, wholesale distribution centre. course start there, like said still investigating source. Salmon people? i'm lazy argue u China control not, even point. 

Heck, u see anything shift ur attention away coronavirus to? No! China talking coronavirus. talking coronavirus. supposed make u shift ur attention coronavirus coronavirus? China must playing 4D chess ur head. think girlfriend gone 25lb flour since mid March. Many people nursing homes DNR orders.  Eh, creating whole bunch jobs went correct processes. I'm fine it. landlord raised rent. Like week, Arizona number one increased covid cases. site started database positive COVID people talking might caught it, meaning talking behaviors interactions they've had? Hope yomorrow better get lgbtq person could support trump sucks truck getting towed! I'm sorry deal that.

My last apartment complex decided start charging us $30/month ""parking"" consisted parking lot never enough spaces came home 7pm, park another building's lot guest parking. excuse charge advertising rent lower actually was. mean that’s scary part, 100% possible looks like they’re way something like that. may quite severe NY simply don’t think states congested NYC is, actions aren’t taken *now* they’re setting really, really bad time distant future. makes realize pay mortgage Scotland, even afford trailer... never know Swedes. One week people die fast, next dying slowly.

Apparently part secret master plan. That's way go honestly. guess problem really outsourcing contracting sweatshops.  people moved BLM protests, although starting become old news well now. Maybe India vs China new thing?

Maybe there's 200k day people pay attention again? didn’t testing, would cases. You’re distasteful. 
I attended Zoom funerals twice: one elder relative, one young Covid victim friends (who nobody, especially children, could visit hospital). Yes it’s harsh. People die alone, buried. swallow it, grieve people die you’re excusing irresponsible behaviors. people could start socially responsible thing don’t ever need military forced quarantines. could acted like adults sacrificed little bit greater good country.  grandfather’s generation went war sacrificed hell lot asked do. going pissed die “conservative” asshole (from red welfare state likely) decides he’s fucking special wear mask.

Of course, it’s late. seems lot disagreement much kids vector, cutoff insignificantly small vector is. need know more. Thankfully US couple months figure out.

In state preschools (day care) open. seem impeded containment. This. rental raise price felt bad it, already barely breaking even, to. former demographic accurate. moved new town tried using facebook connect people mom groups filled multilevel marketing scams antivaxxers local town groups men posting global warming scam 5G towers must blame fishing good anymore. would someone move city insane COL take salary WFH are? desire move tech hub like Austin, husband continues career path, we'll likely end somewhere similar.... unless get freedom WFH. It’s great impulse it’s rule edit titles. carried droplets, we'll prepared cloth face masks.

I go bathroom see stack and, perversely, amuses anything ever thought I'd see. 3,600 new cases today 

3600 can't use lame excuse taking 1000 count tested positive prison wave won’t happen though. article makes sound like tested positive first time Feb remember tests available Feb. Also might taken trip Dallas late Feb known Dallas then.  US Iceland seem far apart age me, least enough explain differences age Depends location I'm going say vast majority outpatient care facilities going bright shiny - Dentist offices stuff like Radiology obsessively cleaned right ensure safety.

I'm going say 100% certainty place going perfectly safe that's impossible know - there's really good chance going place that's perfectly safe health employees care keeping safe.

Plus, going endoscopy one vigorously cleaned pieces medical equipment, [and good chance laparoscopic surgery less invasive, sure going for. Surprise name place. Got it. though surprise! got covid Yeah man would use time figure UCLA gonna go 100% online maybe kid transfer CSU couple semesters get back feet rent. Definitely would consider moving position. Dang sucks. got pretty lucky job, work lot. good flex time need though. Thankfully live one cities mayor taking seriously here, hopefully help save lives. could Onion headline.  strategy fix/update/repair apartment, rent market rate raise rents tenant lives there. mind raising rent someone moves out, mainly pay several thousand dollars fix place leave either due damage wear tear. 

We bought place really good price 2012 expenses quite low pass onto tenants still generating income ourselves. Wear masks,
Wash hands,
Social distance,
And hope best!

That's plan.  racial make nursing home important factor COVID-19 infections? neglecting take care POC? people America small, frightened, ignorant, weak, entitled. live fear, time, they're afraid take relatively simple safe measures would protect them. they're afraid. governors say ""more testing = cases,"" Americans incredulously laugh dismiss notion. Sweden's responsible center-left government says thing? European Union's CDC says thing? absolutely true **more testing picks mild asymptomatic cases**, accurately assess state epidemic unless also carefully compare ICU admissions, hospitalizations specific COVID-19, deaths.

I hope reached peak way down,""** said state epidemiologist Anders Tegnell Public Health Agency's press conference Tuesday.  also criticised international media misrepresenting Sweden's coronavirus statistics.   number new reported cases increasing, Tegnell said due people tested virus therefore mild cases discovered**, previously low testing rates meant serious cases priority groups reported.   interpreted international media new increase reached peak. wrong. course, start test also find cases,""** said. 

And European centre however note **""increases testing Sweden may partly explain this increase""**. Between May 25th June 8th number individuals tested per week Sweden almost doubled 36,500 60, Jesus Christ. stay bunker.

You know there’s roughly 133+ viruses circulating human population, even this. Corona 134. flu, bro... That's happens actually talk people.  totally miss point fair threw shit sides seem miss. It’s quite obvious danish government need look strong crisis made weird albeit small silly policy decisions. it’s normal, works here. 

My point missed right we’re here, today. go here? solve best way go forward? see nothing either side sides suffering it. get kind guy are. like look backwards find scapegoat, look forward solution. 

Remember discussion herd immunity, strategy anything else always want write about, it’s border closures travel recommendations. 

I know lot people businesses suffering sides strait. Öresund region region expansion. It’s quite sad see go waste of, opinion, territorial postings. herd immunity works. Perhaps unsurprisingly, eighty percent U.S. gotten polio vaccine. number even lower count outside CDC's target demographic (i.e.: age 18).

All vaccines prep immune system. still get flu even vaccinated correct strain. also polio vaccine requires multiple vaccinations across long time period, one two vaccinations polio still get it.

Actually coming virus prep immune system.

If actually coming virus confer longterm immunity coronavirus, prepping immune system going virtually useless. best people might immune weeks months, they're suddenly immune catch like otherwise would've albeit much shorter timeline.

Incidentally coronavirus vaccine. submission removed because


**Titles must edited source.** submissions must submitted original title submitted article applicable. article uses caps title, changed [title Editorialization via title editing kind likely removed. ([More believe made mistake, please [message moderators](/message/compose?to=/r/Coronavirus).* Odds we'll hit soon enough. Exponential growth whatnot. Imagine whole South like New York State April, state hunderds thousands cases, hospitals overrun. would even worse March April. allready seeing happening Alabama, Texas, Arizona, etc.  Makes sense. Trump refers humans ""it"". think something Um, Spanish flu one, likely thousands respiratory viruses never know about. plagues ancient times early medieval times don’t know caused certainly went away, given SARS behavior, likely previous SARS like viruses emerged centuries gone.

That’s thing, can’t name them, ones eradicated herd immunity, they’ve gone centuries time could figure are. tenants pay rent time, million things want fixed break, sneak extra family, smoke cigarettes house, I'm raising rent. Unless property tax something goes nuts. course tenants right this, paying rent. Guess whose lease renewed baffles cost much live there......and people willing pay that. now... Warrens nice area Friend gf moved home France UK month ago. Went nicely him, he's much happier London ur good. 10 minutes breathe talk, virus shedding accumulate air. breathed others 10 minutes, exposure, higher viral load.

A 2 second interaction outside door seriously nothing sweat. discussion. shifting personal attack REAL data represent official narrative.  don’t think foreclosures bring prices?  wet means ""covered saturated water another liquid"" could argue water covered water molecules indeed wet. 

Although like saying dirt dirty. really dirty itself, idea covering something else making surface dirty. bank asks questions u acquired $1m property nowhere? lol Plenty cheap places like Pittsburgh. move there? talking about? said talking michigan protestors said wasn't. That's it. definitely knew wear masks, sanitize things, maintain social distancing 3 months ago. Hell, knew things begore even got US cuz saw China flatten curve think there's data shows transmission kids less common. We've got schools open Australia, none school cases led ongoing outbreaks far know. 

However, kids still seem catch easily adults, keeping teachers social distanced COVID free important. There's cases around world teachers infecting large numbers students. That's probably biggest risk opened schools virus suppressed. 

There's also measures like controlled drop points parents allowed enter school. Plus there's temporary closure, cleaning, testing, isolating close contacts, etc. school cases occur. one case earlier week infected teacher contact almost everyone school, they've closed whole school two weeks. Right, dumping money money pile wont fix fact fire. Excise every entrenched institution individual contributes current state affairs. state level first must, succeeds spread others like we're seeing marijuana reform. food cost way off. bonus still poverty line. People pouring major coastal cities said 13 million before, 13 thousand. tickle throat weeks ago self isolated 2 weeks going risk giving family. really love people protect them, even means able them. “Losing money” making much money? Yeah actually probably will. don’t think NBA came entire plan forget restrict it’s employees go. Interesting, molto grazie! probably dumb question antibody first skip straight swab / PCR? antibody easier / faster / cheaper administer? antibody test 100% sensitive miss active cases never get swapped? guess enough matter?

It fantastic working well Lombardy! Thank much info. 

It also makes feel better Sweden's plan since budgeted lion's share testing budget antibody tests, make sense start. Denmark, AFAIK pretty much testing still PCR. think budgeting makes sense given Italy's government allocating infection tracking billion, says Finance Minister Per Bolund (MP). Money obstacle infection detection. government estimates total 6.9 billion testing. Five billion go antibody again. Every country use ahead us PPP 10 million less citizens. wealthy small countries like Qatar, Luxembourg Iceland USA. even mention that. fact is, USA global power much commerce goes them. People hate USA want numbers still there. reason bill used twice high second most.  Well, right... ive worked guy AMA ah yes tell us people arent thinking know they're really hoping one asks. know get magnificent chicken waffles though. guess getting downvoted people voted parties follow kind common sense reasoning... Yea, need find good landlord. Someone want place sit empty thinks passive income bonus. landlord actually lowered price rent $100 year (while rent prices city shooting up) took decent care place want risk new tenants shitty. Finding good landlord hard, worth long run. Yehp.

Today worse.

Sigh... Florida gov. Desantis said wont lockdown lot estate sales year. wait. exactly. CDC take samples expired drugs stockpile check potency. meets minimum level, change expiration date. issue opening soon, absolute lack leadership government anything time allotted.

PPE, simple masks, social distancing guidelines enforced pandemic reached levels did, are, people still wearing masks, going crowded indoor environments, acting like nothing going on. 

My point is, given months additonal lockdown time work with, would done differently? Nothing. 12% positive test rate yesterday, 15% positive test rate today (not many tests today yesterday, though).

I think that's even worse sign, tbh. Six figures isn’t comfortable Bay Area. Family 4 making $120k year qualifies low income housing assistance according HUD. I’m saying gives people idea area, cost, space. Regardless make, relationship same. understand real estate different costs lmao that’s point know filled corrupt sociopathic administration US history. Leech Seriously? Madrid, Bergamo, NYC decided lockdown reason.

What price sorry? Sweden open. many tourists going see summer?
Brazil even better sweden point view... imagine people cannot wait take flights enjoy holidays brazil.. higher % deaths care homes Sweden: 60% vs. 50% disproves scapegoating failure elder care. difference % elder care, wide disease spread generally.

And another home care/assistance 70+ age group Sweden. New temps going home home, many language barriers, training usually poorer stay home since paid hour.Can't find stats Norway's home care. sure failure, course part much neighbors extremely similar Sweden much better outcomes. heavily indicate stricter, earlier NPIs dramatic effect, line growing body scientific evidence saying early least moderately strict lockdowns work.

As see analysis, much stricter, except Denmark. 
\- Gatherings 50 limit set later, already effect before, since large small events canceled hosts will. 
\- Pubs bars closed Finland Denmark, restaurants Norway rules here. bars also enforced distance, order table etc. 
\- Schools 9th grade Sweden kept open (but everything points main driver)

Places like cinemas/museums closed will. Everyone recommended work home could (and did) avoid unnecessary travel (check mobile patterns), sick leave without doctors note 14 days, etc. Cities ghost towns. (and many others) seem idea everything business usual, clearly wasn't.

So look like much actual differences countries terms social distancing ""lockdown"".

And Denmark fared much better Norway Finland, since much stricter earlier lockdown? First result population Stockholm estimated 910,000 2016 population density 4,800 people per square kilometer, 13,000 per square mile. Thats kinda tricky. we’ve decreased work areas, picked others. example, ER. fear COVID looms, aren’t seeing many ppl coming ER minor issues. Like, coming im excuse work, something could handled doc box. hand, people stay home longer due fear time arrive, pretty bad. 
Some day day stuff decreased- running pft lab due COVID generates lot money department. result, try keep fewer staff refrain overtime hours. Breathing treatments given absolutely needed given, filtered nebs reduce spread aerosolized particles could potentially spread virus. 
The main drag time, equipment, beds, ppe, quality care. treat covid patients ventilators gown prior entering room. Due shortage ppe we’ve get creative. tyvex suit covers head toe, face shield, gloves, respirator two rain ponchos. enter covid covid possible room suit put poncho on. exit, co worker sprays us Virex, remove poncho #1 hang dry. put poncho #2 see next patient. done, come out, get sprayed, hang up, put poncho #1 back (as dried) move next patient. 
The vent monitors set outside room ventilators inside room. need make adjustments ventilator settings, outside room without getting gowned up. takes LOT time. Plus, suits dont ventilate well. patient codes cpr, like working sauna. make things difficult, intubate patient, nurse, anesthesiologist, Respiratory Therapist room- necessary safety. problem right? Well, monitor outside room means cant always see it, also means need another therapist outside adjusting settings respirator makes difficult communicate. codes intubations smooth, others shit-shows. 

We fortunate work. guy picture, Dr. Salisky, got sponsors community bought entire department respirators start thing. Yes, cam overwhelming times respiratory department Jackson really done best given protect patients. Ive heard horror stories hospitals area haven’t lucky. long winded response is, even glimpse ins outs hospital whole. living rural Alabama, sadly, beginning see effects COVID right Governor opened state. There’s much I’d like say, feel like I’m ranting point. Hope helps, questions let know. 
Thanks advanceFor ignoring grammatical errors proofread response. Moisture essence wetness America, fuck yeah! problem maximum occupancy amount actually seat two different things. know place that’s rated 100 people seats 50. 75% capacity, technically place people usual they’re still legally clear. Better prepared stay 8nside summer. Heat humidity think obvious answer gambling addicts.

Leaving aside time travel kind madman wants start beginning pandemic. they're making up. check classifieds craigslist. prices bay area budged made fucking bed, lie it. Several foreign-owned managed complexes Boulder County raising rents 25% year. $1200 $1500 1-bedroom... 

These complexes eviction notices plastered tenant doors... It’s double Bay Area. salaries 200k wtf kind response that? crazy/bad. uhhh, goodbye. mass protests cool earning living taboo? LMAO excuses DOOM AWAY Testing stalled NY gone up. Protests larger. Yet still percentage positive results continue go down. That's magical thinking, observable data. Yes Good. Isn’t sheriff 60 days in? feel like could go back month ago comment ""Told so"" people cheering states opening early.

How say this,

#DUUHHHHHHHHHHHH

Listen epidemiologists epidemiology. Listen climatologists climatology. Fox News manipulating you. 

If think wearing mask right now, pull air, oil, fuel filters car, clearly think filters work. This, I’m one people. deja vu use example another post? Amazing people understand ""I'll fine"" mean ""everybody else fine too."" Downvoted pushing narrative catching COVID-19 vast lifelong effects. I've I've completely back normal months now. honest even know got tested antibodies, came back positive, realized thought bad cold March actually coronavirus. say disease serious something take lightly, simply point catching disease condemn life long-term consequences. Can't peak hospitalization never slow growth *tapshead.jpg one, early enough data come anything better guesstimate. knows people podcast long time. lot youtube/podcast individuals popular early. California.... good. good..... Yeah, bad respiratory infection fuck you’re sick. you’re level ICU disease like covid, I’m shocked.

I hope reports people’s lungs finally starting heal like saw SARS true gentleman’s lungs start bouncing back soon! monumental dumbass there’s huge difference mass gathering people outdoors wearing masks bunch pandemic deniers gather indoors without masks difference matters two scenarios group associated 45% increased risk COVID-19 respiratory failure, blood group associated 35% lower risk, relative blood groups. Something something dry heat kills virus guess Never something good free Um truly common. isn't. would depend manifestation infectious severe. people travel even areas took precautions. Yes, protests happened Minnesota. /s went protests Detroit. Everyone wearing masks, although 6ft rule always followed. think we've seen spike yet. lived Santa Rosa paid 700 bed shared room nothing else included. Lol got dirt? ate lunch endless void. people holes lungs  makes curious. would happen Trump dies like Nov 1st? Would Pence become president Nov 1st Jan 20? Trump dies Nov 3rd? Would make Biden president immediately would Pence still president Nov 4 Jan 20? Whoa Where? That, think, going biggest risk. We’re already tourism state there’s even incentive people come we’re open like normal. people don’t care aren’t taking precautions going like “let’s go Disney! spend week beach!”.  Yes, medics across almost every state made practice handing masks anyone wearing one. thing protests people show expectation could potentially get pepper sprayed/cs gassed, pandemic, basically everyone faces covered. 100% someone forgot specify antibody_test = ‘false’

1. California +4,179 *NEW RECORD*
2. Texas +3,511
3. Florida +2,610
4. Arizona +1,827
5. North Carolina explanations numbers high,” Abbott said. “It could Memorial Day celebrations. could bar settings.”

It could Governor Abbott. really could. Sorry, Dr Fauci banned Trump meetings giving many facts cautions pandemic. see, President knows simply ignore problem poof like miracle disappears Memorial day? Good. Rent housing general needs come down. Waaaaayyyy down. ridiculous people spend 50% net income housing live area that's bug infested crime ridden. Yet keep building new apartments can't fill ones (because charge double-triple be).

Also, rent increases general fixed certain rate IMO (perhaps inflation smidge extra). paying say $750/month first year, allowed increase say $1,000/month next year. Especially literally nothing changed price. US screwed then... Well less AZ.. Way 90% NY's cases city suburbs. I'd imagine Westchester county lot population density Pinal county. that's suburbs.

It ~~shouldn't~~ bad NY. Ha ha Still good article  know little testing, maybe cut week that, everyone starts wearing masks quickly..... that's true fuck mean fair?

They sabotaged efforts slow disease. can't even resist opportunity make simple things like mask wearing political issue. 

There anything fair Trump administration behaved issue. mean propaganda barbie repeatedly said mask wearing recommendation, requirement. okay irresponsible illegal. 

Why need fair them? appear claiming many contracted January longer antibodies. take time see replicated anywhere else. couple papers suggest in-household attack rate low average lot people aren’t major spreaders certain minority infected super-spreaders.

So societally it’s super contagious, within small groups significant odds spread. Since divorce 1979 almost living situations involved roommates, sometimes said roomie home owner. four year stretch renting tiny house guy, company. eight years living old family home, first take care declining parents, years died.

Then moved TX. Found apartment share north Austin. admire anyone lives apartment, meaning shit put with. medium sized complex. park lot five days week lease. hike get mail take trash out. Sometimes noisy neighbors. Communal laundry. always worried bike would get stolen. Slow maintenance. 

I felt control shelter.

It happened six months moved in, financial ship came right lease renewal. time, roomie's kids bought tiny condo bought house Round Rock. wanted rent 5%. 

Sure glad Rick could say, ""Fuck you."" Garbage thirty feet away. Bike locked garage. Laundry next kitchen. Mailbox front. Great, quiet neighbors (in fact, I'm occasionally loud one!) Yeah, maintenance, sometimes paid things can't do, great trade me. 

Again, hat rent apartment. It’s true many people taken seriously get infected? 

Makes believe somebodies shadow play Recked lol unit tests? “Houston, we’ve got problem” - “We too...” I’m SF pay $2000 room rent longer damn high? way unless Trump actually dying reveal tested positive. They'll say ""He's vacation"" media asks seen 2 weeks. lease renewal comes end month. put paper envolope details costs moving new apartment. really trying keep tenants guess.  Although we'll see- seeing rent increases ""rent price increase freeze"" states municipalities passed back March. we'll see. Yup. many places pretty much vulnerable day closed. \*Surprised Pikachu Face meme.jpg\* 


so fuckin appropriate here. ask question everyday. Yep, like people heart attacks strokes appendicitis car crashes whatever. Nope got put there’s pandemic. Well theres 100k dead far even 1% population infected yet (2,234,471 330,933,464 time writing this) probably underestimating damage. isn’t. see. meant quarantine outside nursing home assume nearly impossible given configuration nursing homes. even concentration high risk individuals essentially communal conditions would unwise since consequences breach would amplified greatly. 100% 
Lying dug people deeper confusion mistrust. Fauci needs resign disappear. False idol. Yup. don’t feel bad, actually shocked/happy minute thought like “holy shit, he’s actually making responsible move here?!?” re-read saw overflow disclaimer. 

I can’t see ending well...not supporters, know 0 distancing 0 masks anywhere sight bunch rabid lunatics screaming lungs out. Better late ne er... Smh

""Doug Ducey stop blocking mayors requiring masks stops short issuing statewide regulation"" read makes want cry. Los Angeles rents stupidly priced. Weird keeps coming country built slavery genocide, it? could possibly reason unpredictable surge? Brian Shaw go actually sucked end? back n forth really tiring. one month lost rent tenants divided year probably I'd people stayed years. wants deal new tenants coming going time. 6 units 4 10+ years, 2 almost 20. sound alarm Oregon yet, numbers low little outbreak cause spike, like church outbreak occured think NYU students. expensive school. NY everyone bickers whether masks necessary runners you’re outside near anyone, wear one bc it’s social norm can’t shop without one. hear people getting shamed states wearing one truly blows mind. noteworthy though, since almost exactly line percentage population comprise.  3 67? say they're pretty good! But.. but.. governor Ducey said today “Arizonans common sense people”



Get OUTTA open we're ready to, gonna last longer--as we're seeing. actually listen stay-at-home orders, wear masks, stop hanging people outside household, lockdowns sooner. constant protests complete lack masks, worst yet come. I've seen packed businesses driving barely soul wearing mask. rename Trumpchloroquine? discouraging. First, look [campaign (from days ago) hugging, shaking hands with, posing selfies literally hundreds people. absolute outpouring fuctktardary face book page. Basically hundreds versions of:

* Thank service. Prayers family.
* Prayers every peace officer job protecting us!

And maybe every hundreth comment talking maybe worn mask, inevitably batted Karen ""can't believe negativity.""

This country so, screwed, cv19. ""In tough times, tough decisions made,"" said. ""I'm looking two laws hand [and] going one that's 200 years old rather two days old.""

This one single dumbest things I've ever read. Nah. Trump Bolsanaro still caught it... Yet Wednesday numbers always high that's day check registers find deaths missed statistics. Also, always reporting lag weekends. Current numbers around 40 deaths/day. Don’t forget though governors formed coalition. think seven states vowed work together (like sort United group states) make sure things didn’t get hand everywhere feel health workers. end this, going need lot help themselves. physical toll huge, mental strain significantly more. saw interviews nurses New York hard hit places heart breaking. Seeing people without masks slap face sacrifices every single health worker making. guess im curious done? One way homes shutting whether lawsuits lack income. Outside couple area nursing homes Onondaga county (central new york), isolate workers weeks essentially lock seniors 45 days, way ensure asymptomatic workers make system, even daily testing (false negatives, sick work, virus clothes, etc) Yeah think Fauci said Trump met two weeks, eternity pandemic time. federal voices reason shoved aside favor voices political popularity. States right thing struggling fill void, states whose leaders motivated politics facts (Texas, Florida, Arizona, I'm looking you) one federal government counter narrative.  people like him? peddler people want really learn anything new want worldview justified puked back reassurance. like Ben Shapiro regard. 

They opportunistic charlatans. DuPage County, IL (traditionally conservative Chicago suburbia.) stores signs masks due governor’s order everyone store wearing one, although way many nose hanging out.

But “closed” playgrounds also busy. ""Mission Accomplished!"" fooled what?

It's still sad die. I'd prefer wear masks, want sentence death so. reopened June 1st. 30 guests allowed inside restaurants time (you need reservation, checked symptoms entrance). also sit outside without reservation. tables need least 1.5 apart.

Secondary schools also reopened start month, June 2nd (June 1st Pentecost Monday, national holiday), students also need stay 1.5 apart time being, believe schools providing combination digital on-location teaching.

There's also testing contact tracing done since June 1st - everyone cold symptoms get test now. air circulation way Haha, got boring fast. reminded pornhub existed spent 24 hours exploring, science noticed lot economic bad news stories getting written Pravda style, burying ledes, talking second order derivatives (the rate metric declining gone instead metric is), removing federal berniebux gig workers applications total total new UI unemployment claims.  I've seen UK too. FFS, finished working high risk environment, go home, shower change clothes exposing general public whatever picked work. selfish. Same. People r nuts spoiled freedom. common *single* type, majority areas. Roughly 44% US, example, according Red Cross. However, varies lot place place, mainly ethnicity region. [Wikipedia nice charts said, even study (which gone peer review yet) finds type people 14%% less likely catch virus, 19% less likely require hospitalization. Yes, statistically significant, definitely taken pass bother protecting type O. worries. Good rant, enjoyed it. nice see people live close at-risk people flummoxed people either think loved ones invincible completely delusional. use resources side. i'm basic research.

get informed. $800 per room whole thing?? What's crazy said two months ago yet STILL holds smh 

Wonder normal deaths common causes?

Some states 10% cancer others 20-25% normal death causes? Well way go northeastern states exponentially worse fl. Hopefully bad them....in meantime let's shit fl cases dont even come close toNY numbers? Yep; one friends posted mild case COVID, said bedridden delirious around two weeks. 

Of course, dumbasses comments express worst confirmation bias ever, saying things like ""it's glad hear mild cases manipulated media thinking bad.""

Hey idiot, want laid two weeks? sure hell - sounds fucking terrible.   begs question aren’t honest it

No doesn't, going invent asymptomatic ratio brainwashed. Since masks pandemic politicized, I’m sure would ever things needed safely reopen, get. Good luck us all.

Edit: spelling desperately wish mayor would this, although based ive seen cases arent rising staying ""steady"". Id like see decline. 

And less less people wearing them, point feel little ""silly"" im almost one wearing anymore. That’s exactly meant  yet new epicenters despite reopenings... mean mandated till now? US joke Downvoted providing facts CDC. subreddit awesome! /s People dismissing science issue, things made worse.

First, although respect Fauci think trying walk political tightrope good; members science community really shot foot 

Instead telling us straight mask good soon learned; tried ""filter"" spin news. 

 ""*According Anthony Fauci, nation’s leading infectious disease expert key member White House coronavirus task force, masks weren’t advised public start anticipated PPE shortages.* ""

They continue disservice day, "" *Do use facemask meant healthcare worker.* "" 

Instead paternalistic, tell straight. otherwise undermines credibility.

Second, expect undervalued science failed teaching science US. time science seems really valued brings us new toy, better video game, faster porn.  bad then, sure talking purely nursing homes - suck begin - retirement homes well. thing, 65 immune compromised serious conditions like diabetes high blood pressure going require hospitlization.

Its good saying Canada, even symptoms, beginning even now, doctors like dont covid 19, go home rest  somewhere around 10x normal YTD. Great. Mate come on. get anything internet, dont mask yet flat paying attention. Got walk place pick food. Never physical bullied life, lot time lots constant verbal harassment could bullying kids, important thing gone, kids could become weaker emotionally due heavy verbal harassment students, back like grade 6 7, classmates dislike always talk shit students, faced lots verbal harassment early middle school ages, heck, even main teacher grade 7 hated well verbally saying worse thing teachers, could handle type stuff imagine verbal bullying could also huge factor kids learning affect emotionally. sounds fine fun! Yup truly plenty places go beach you’re crowded all. Good choice attend bars restaurants, fun! dont understand people willing give summer vacation. staycation. Get shit done. 13 university Texas football players tested positive virus another 10 quarantined contact. 27% team sidelined foreseeable future. boycotting traders joe began didnt allow employees wear mask. changed? please let know thanks. Skåne, Halland Blekinge allowed show negative covid test. Forget anti-science bias, complete incompetence, stupidity, priorities set non covid-19 matters, citizens protesting without considering social distancing times even wearing mask, demanding full reopening without compromise, administration longer focused dealing pandemic. Anti-science bias least bit problem tests still constantly tested vaccines researched. vaccine out, pro-science power marketing. Think it. Insane. I’m starting believe number asymptomatic cases country immensely higher believe, good thing bad thing. He's amazing. He's writing hard-hitting stuff like years. realize Henry Ford extremely anti-semite... real dick personality regarding that... start taking away everything people held racist views 100 years ago... need kinda chill automatically erases otherwise impressive life. saying ignore either... look everything context. Slave traders, Confederates, etc.. yea fuck em... start saying take every name anyone racist anti-Semetic view, names... Washington Jefferson would everything, rooseveldts... could go on. Weigh everything context, maybe 21st century lense. Current [FL coronavirus stats .... county wish best luck. they've already published papers saying works approved trials completed tested larger groups. done best monty python impression, think that's failed test. agree, hospitalizations real ""oh shit"" warning sign. Unfortunately state--as far know--does publish numbers ICU beds use. I'm mistaken please let know info found. 
I couple people know working hospitals bug seeing, obviously hospital serves small-ish area. wondered places experiencing worse outbreaks others seen speculating warmer states indoor exposure cool circulating air and/or disregard masks, there's Georgia seem fit mold. wear wrap around safety glasses. guess least he's good something.

Hm, don’t think good idea all, think good idea Norway allowed travel Gotland. think bit safer since Västerbotten huge tourism trail AFAIK. Maybe Danish hunters, large group. Anyway, enforcing regional entry feel realistic all, several Danish experts say thing: Well, Skåne specifically back table, applies opening given region would think. 

It’s also clear “testing requirements” yet, hopefully becomes clear whole country go back exclusion list since regions Sweden testing well right now. 

There's big outcry Danish social media (it's widely viewed victory big business right wing) hopefully ruling left government pushed back towards harder line. Or, again, they'll come testing criteria strict Sweden becomes exclusion zone again. Yes true. yes they've gotten well deserved criticism actually Spain places, like town. cars coming stopped, proof address required entry. permanent, holiday weekends etc done. retirement homes, people live years years. deaths worst part them.

We sign leases certain amount time (usually year time). gets close end that, either landlord tenant decide sign new lease. landlord want tenant resign whatever reason, believe there's requirement to.

Once move in, pretty much caveat responsible damage do. Normal wear tear included, example walls need repainted lived somewhere 5 years, something tenant would charged for. also requirements landlord provide notice entering unit (usually 24 48 hours), except case emergency (like water leak gas leak, etc).

How even criminal negligence epidemic? It’s like didn’t know better. knew exactly doing.

Meanwhile slips sidewalk front home sued. Nothing fault doing. CMMS? mean CMS?? 

Just spouting Netflix docufacts, huh? 

My advice try reading single coherent reliable thing get another argument someone (not me- suffered foolishness far long already). It’s cringeworthy ignorant this. I’m truly embarrassed you. I’m sarcastic, really feel sad you. Move along. Nothing see here. It’s mental gymnastics.

It’s simple risk management.

In interior space, air shared circulated amongst people gathered. longer people there, other’s air circulated shared. evidence suggest COVID-can transmitted via aerosols particles. body heat people sitting room creates little mini weather systems - warmer air rises, cools, falls, air circulates.

Also indoors event plenty opportunities shared touch points - think door knobs, hand railings, tables, tea coffee making facilities, toilets, pens people register attendance with; gathering choke points - entrances exits people gather linger chat, even hug shake hands. One sneeze near door knob everyone gets it. Etc.

At outdoor events, risks don’t exist greatly reduce.

Air isn’t circulated - generally dissipates, taken wind. fewer touch points - doors etc. There’s plenty opportunity touch points on, example, public transport way outdoor event, certainly isn’t risk free.

Which you’re either events, indoor out, you’re going want wear mask, bring hand sanitiser, wash sanitise you’re hands regularly, attempt maintain social distancing.

If take steps personally, already greatly decreasing chance catching COVID. Then, outdoor event, chance reduced situation. indoor convention, chance greatly increased situation.

If indoor event populated numpties refuse wear mask, refuse bother take precautions like hand washing, refuse practice basic distancing hug shake hands.... well, sure, might catch - *risk* greatly increased.

It’s risk management, mental gymnastics, it’s pretty much common sense. choose view something risk, sure, ignore evidence science common sense. remember choices also affect health others.

As said, wouldn’t go protest don’t, personally think people should. Australia, recommendations (distancing, handwashing, gatherings, high rate testing, well managed contact tracing quarantine, etc) cases reduced pretty much 0, protests allowed, banned, depending risk profile event. hard - again, risk management. give much credit. actually communications degree, may actually understood messages scientific community. Leave Ayn Rand it. Atlas Shrugged phenomenal book read multiple ways. rest though...Ugh. We’re trouble. sure voted posting truth. Testing increased CA lot, positivity rate actually going (unlike TX, AZ, FL), suggests spread increasing missed cases getting caught. However, CA going stage 3 opening bars, movie theaters, casinos, etc, likely get worse. Really happy mask requirement Newsom today. Even 10 20% people wear masks again, go long way slow spread. Like miracle  THD website updating me. Where’d see 120? shit beach? really underestimate dumb ignorant average person is. Think stupidest person know, half population dumber that. We'll take back land Oklahoma, New Mexico, Kansas, Colorado, Wyoming. would hope hell contacting parents! would PISSED child’s daycare worker test positive didn’t tell us. They’ve exposed. self quarantine least. live California won’t able go stores restaurants. They’ll simply refuse service. Delete space want work don’t see using swimmers tape ..... Americans sick fear porn portrayed media. It’s crisis crisis, American psyche sick hearing it. 

I’m guilty times, it’s misplaced anger media manipulation. San Diego 3rd highest infections deaths CA. Still failing Newsom’s reopening metrics (actually double rate) yet reopening continues. Wtf nonsense fail see could survive legal challenge. Thank What's solution? Upstate here- restaurants bars filled people last weekend. scientists judges Galileo's trial - scientists believed consensus theories day. New theories like dinosaur-killing asteroids plate tectonics routinely rejected even mocked.  Americans may anti-science, religion origin attitude.  much deeper ""people listen question told"".

I'd venture say anti intellectualism pushed extremes. People share scientific articles without understanding mean (so many people this) come conclusions founded reality.

Reading scientific article basically gibberish anyone field, actually need expert decipher you.

but people still going share they're going share ""look headline"".

The media guilty taking articles portraying correctly course, lot misunderstanding even works. scientific method testing hypothesis making people disprove findings. often understand ""wrong"" they're trying find true.

And respond another scientific article refutes whatever findings person linked?

Fake news. fake news? Well wanted see, that's why. repeat ad nauseum get today, people untrusting science agree predisposition.

aka... anti intellectualism. ok science agrees think. wish would see hand washing. People busy fighting masks (which wear) feel importance vigorous hand washing gotten lost. mUh fReEdUmBs!

Reeeeeeee Several weeks ago Harris county judge tx counties made mask mandatory, everyone wearing mask.  Can't blame people caring.

Working service industry Myrtle right sounds like hell. Stay safe. thinks sitting sauna cure yes, call police trespassing. Mask enforcement done people without guns hips. really trying argue refusing wear mask good public health get chosen pleasure activity back, unique risk public health?

Can explain logic better “because want I’m big baby gimme won’t cooperate”?

Edit: also, understand wearing masks past weeks, we’d probably great reason continue ban sporting events, right? First mow lawn, get paid, kid. San Diego like seaside bubble entitlement. 

Getting people understand even basic common sense societal norms futile gesture. People aren’t ignorant here- they’re also content. post source that? certainly can. Let explain like 5:

That's using justification 7 day rolling average shoot another 1000. Basically undoing 30% lockdown last 3 days.

It’s pretty simple. concerned people buying PPE health care professionals needed made wrong call. mean it’s like people didn’t go apeshit buy toilet paper stores month Kleenex number things. It’s like country never replenished supply masks could done three years prior mind administration indeed warned pandemic like could happen. 

The messaging mishandled nothing compared pretending isn’t problem something made one political party. People still refuse wear masks beneficial. Two wrongs make right. things true correct others. point none really matters. post mortem truly fault, won’t Dr. Fauci. doesn’t take elementary school understanding critical thinking get that. That’s you’re downvoted. People shouldn’t fight primitive preconceived notions. isn’t hard best everyone involved instead something mildly inconveniences them. honestly, one major problems America. longer land free. land ME. work medical facility.

Ohioan here. Live suburb, work service retail densely populated area (but Cleveland itself). Less masks less populous suburbs, population dense. white, white people wearing masks anecdotal evidence. 

Masks every worker working retail (myself included). lectures folks wearing masks. smile listen, even try justify actions, work make people feel good paid. 

I allowed kick maskless people out, allowed encouraged different things. try get business completed get store asap within boundaries politeness. thank customers wear masks considering safety one worker allowed bring back. want reinforce considerate behavior fellow human. 

Less employees working smaller stores restaurants before. meticulous disinfecting store. know saved someone, might worth it. really sure places, always disinfectant cleaning supplies handy grocery stores shop at. really eat inside restaurants, generally take even COVID, really qualified comment prepared food services.

Though hear resentment folks DeWine Amy Acton lockdown orders, tend come loud people. I'm super rural, folks around except loud generally pleased DeWine Acton's handling situation.

In case, wise thing would root Swedish strategy. 1. entered thread responding comment CDC. 

2. responded whataboutism concerning president. 

Ergo, created political environment responded. 

Since politics here, fuck trump. 

Hope remain safe healthy Maybe. I'm still opinion avoid disastrous second wave first actually wear masks socially distance (at least CT). low prevalence, widespread testing, social distancing + mask wearing, contact tracing, actually significantly mitigate second wave.and nearly first was. could anyone possibly seen coming? trying say don’t point, didn’t get report asymptotic spread rare? point mandating medical tests., wanted sure information iI correct. anyone know what's cases people test positive covid-19 90+ days negative IgG antibodies? bones left god test faith. legit relatives believe show sounds dumb. much this.

Northern Italy higher death rate Singapore cause avarage age higher. unless age 80 something guarantee risk dying get disease good bit 10%. don’t necessarily think true. First wave indicates first time virus rips population, whereas come August, sizable number people especially places like NYC preexisting immunity. Plus people Northeast wear masks. all, one knows, think it’s soon say “this second wave look like”. what? know beginning today. divide deaths cases get 5.5%. Pick day. day.

They also used sourced articles used term ""overwhelmed"" took mean full specify that.

I'm finding article/videos recent using terms like ""at capacity"" ""overwhelmed"", source shows actual hospital beds/ICU spots available? find hard believe numbers find still 83 percent week later. Prevalence many people disease high-prevalence setting, positive predictive value increases — meaning likely persons test positive truly antibody positive – test performed population low-prevalence. test used population prevalence low, positive predictive value drops false-positive results, since pre-test probability low.

Maybe getting infected less virus start with? things would point predisposition continue fighting virus saw again, viral load answer depend person situation. There's still lot know.

I actually looking paper cited analyzed 37 patients China yes see lower immune response patients asymptomatic, would find surprising since patients would less virus fight off. positive asymptomatic patients still developed antibodies could help ward future infection, negative showed drops antibody levels within 2-3 months infection asymptomatic symptomatic people. Though said serum groups still able neutralize virus well 2-3 months important correlate level antibodies gives protection.

Sweden locking down, yet coming side relatively unscathed, makes many world leaders look really bad.

People suck. Haters gonna hate. Cuomo, I’ll shut regions start upticks, yet region doubled since Memorial Day allowed phase 3 open. data facts I’m sure he’s thinking. Maybe get certain number drops phase, knows. Especially voted someone tries one big city elites. make ok demonize everyone prepared masks.

Your previous comment talking Fauci, still referring someone else? Fauci demonize mask wearers? merged WEAR MASKS MASKS MAGIC SOMEHOW STAY HOME ORDERS BULLSHIT VIRUS WOKE SPREAD PROTEST DUH Yeah agree makes sense think may slow somewhat summer, however definitely people believed would disappear summer, evident article. FL general. Would like see try. Send vlogs I’m praying push era performative selfishness cruelty get place masks normalized everywhere. Glad know places managing that. OH FUCK, rogan going shit. his. pants know someone moved Canada Iceland school. Less week getting Iceland (this week, fact) he's helicopter tour.

I'm worried sufficient isolation. I'm unaware PCR tested. fairness president one actually lead us. Absolutely. many far away friends wonder possible. believe people actually masked keeping distance this. merged Welp, take back said we're fucked species. still early who-won game, point far Sweden's economy better anyone else's. strange doubt smartest people planet, yet..... merged Masks great mandatory everywhere right now.

Being non-moron also required. today weekly shopping trip saw kid pull mask sneeze going store. small part they're busy stroking confirmation bias reading articles FB Reddit instead fact-checking Wikipedia Snopes. Seriously he’s smoking looking [this can't help notice reported COVID-19 deaths cases peak every Tues-Thurs, trough Sunday-Monday. assume kind reporting quirk, seems especially strange given national number aggregated state numbers. idea what's going here? FUCKING FINALLY. NY wearing masks now. Sure idiots store nose wearing one all. majority wearing correctly clearly effective numbers gone since started. like keep policy arguments based reality. youre saying easy agree america going happen. Therefore realistic option lock us landlords banks going sue put street. Majority lockdown forever arguments based fantasy unfortunately country live in. Cuomo cancelling briefings too. Well, people properly distance themselves. Even though extremely unlikely young people die this, still possible. Hope people realize this. Sobering up? still bars Scottsdale.  he's targeted disinformation campaign. I'm really sure why, either he's insane (the ridiculous formatting shitposts massive bolded fonts good indication that), can't quite fathom would anyone focus much energy trying shit reasonable approach (that might might successful end, complex issue need multidisciplinary approach deal with) , he's sock puppet organization.

Reading posts one may believe one successful countries world last decades pretty much metric may think of, suddenly decided go mass senicide reason. Damn Karen draconian measures implemented airlines actually want make fly knowing I’ll 95% safe. Booked trip August Delta. IMO, drive, drive. not, really need think skipping. massive proportional 12% US population? Yes wasent something said Coronavirus matches 95% previous SARS? Im wondering anyone actually done study Mandatory masks Spain certainly big impact. Isn’t guy who’s Live PD? agree. love work people work with. disagree...we need trying succeed fail...we hear many things working hear trial six months. end extra $600 moratorium evictions coming end gonna see shit show like never before. bu bu bu ECONOMY wearing masks? everywhere else. even Maybe think virus dare get nostrils. Virus sees mask backs off, even worn incorrectly. try correct anymore. Tried kindly remind one wear incorrectly started arguing minding business. Canada start pandemic, everyone presenting symptoms told stay home self-isolate. Heck, emergency rooms empty. It’s race nationality thing. told seek medical care unless trouble breathing! Yeah I've definitely heard good things social distancing Bay Area (I friend there). idea cases continuous climb in, say, San Francisco? matter density? life don’t get masks “unpopular” . People god damn unfathomably stupid . Yeah read article. claim stuck little premature, they've still got year could probably claim stuck it. shit article. Things like mandated time. fucking mask.  People need get fuck themselves. wear mask need put house arrest kept away everyone else.  US going forced taking hard line people change attitudes right fucking now. uplifting news  exactly. everybody line appreciates that. least should. know could without governor's permission. QUESTION: join military COVID-19?

THE ANSWER: Yes, according Matthew P. Donovan, undersecretary defense personnel readiness. Damn. AZ, CA, TX, FL getting hammered right now. close NY peak, still pretty bad. think that's difficult thing. government said ""masks help, please buy right need masks elsewhere"" mattered. mean fucking selfish country significant portion country gives zero fucks.

So charge would said would try make sure healthcare workers access proper PPEs? Would lied? Would told truth knowing so, sacrificing healthcare worker's lives (lack PPEs)? absolute failure get outbreak control making unforced errors every turn defining legacy Trump administration.

how many times chosen wrong? Wearing good quality face-shield N95 mask - good practice, over-doing it?

Indoors outdoors? many people around you? There’s many factors give single answer. QUESTION: join military COVID-19?

THE ANSWER: Yes, according Matthew P. Donovan, undersecretary defense personnel readiness.  Wasn’t plan along?? It’s nice see Abbott thinks game, hopefully everybody Texas remembers comes time vote QUESTION: join military COVID-19?

THE ANSWER: Yes, according Matthew P. Donovan, undersecretary defense personnel readiness.  Well yeah, masks one compliance easily identifiable. Problem is, we’ve got 20% people wearing masks outside Disney World. 

Honestly, anyone ever public restrooms knows/ must assume one washing hands ever. least defense dirty hands don’t touch face, immediately hand sanitize upon leaving store, wash hands, wipe packages groceries thyme oil wipes approved virus. You’re correct. Now, likely won’t get rid virus, opportunity acted quickly strongly beginning. quarantine wouldn’t lasted long people taken seriously needed be. 

Viruses eradicated strong enough measures technology so. Look happened polio measles. non-existent extremely rare US anti-vaccinations began. But, previously, people social distance children fear children becoming paralyzed waist life. 

We ability stop US considered “just another flu” lies “it affecting old people”. Oh, mention “masks don’t work”? /s

Look measures took prevent Ebola 2014.

Also, treat like “All Nothing” situation. It’s definitely that. takes persistence precautions. I'm type 1 diabetic, great control. told doctor go work even though there's evidence I'm likely catch it, catch much higher risk suffering serious complications.

I contacted employer come back work 3 times, provided 3 separate doctors letters stating return work due high risk status.

The first time letter accepted bought weeks. 2nd time letter accepted told return would replaced. contacted head HR, forwarded email/text correspondence, well doctors letters. worked another week 2.

 contacted end last week head HR asking come back. said would contact doctor see said, let know. received another letter doctor saying return work continue stay leave. contacted direct boss saying return, would taken furlough (lose health insurance), placed ""temporary lay off"" &amp; terminated within 30 days return. forwarded correspondence HR never heard back.

I'm getting married next year &amp; wedding pay fiancee, need new car, can't afford lose health insurance unemployed.

I've coming work almost full week now. people wear masks, social distancing possible. I'm legitimately terrified everyday. I've trying show want worry fiancee family, I've teared car leaving work every morning sometimes way home worried scared this. 

I know I'm probably overreacting, really know anymore I'm really scared get okay.

Sorry, think needed rant bit.
TLDR: shit sucks. Also- even though didn’t get benefits one week, still eligible weeks. doesn’t automatically disqualify certifying forever, specifically state back work full time longer need UI. No, no, right nothing could done. countries probably also seeing rates rise like US it’s giant state nothing careful they're now, comment pointless. Chicago New York though, neither respective states upticking. Honestly, beach, Dizzy World, Sneeze World, etc., etc.,etc., next year. spoiled can't possibly wait next year visit places plague year. Unbelievable. Went come back vacay, please quarantine 14 days. That's going for.

People assuming since ""it's outside"", since risk lower outdoors, they're safe.

And keep safe distance others, bother masks, maybe get drink on, etc. run problems described.

And presto, fuck-ton people beach get sick. Beach shut again. Nobody wins. That's beauty it! people would adopt privacy concerns existed. Oddly, many people think app invades privacy know nothing it! I’m taking issue framing. People worried take possible precautions. point third-hand horror stories ICUs go viral twitter reddit regularly carry unhelpful implications scared people be, based visceral version information isn’t new. trace back see pushing adamantly re-opening fast possible... Hahhaha meant GOv...damn it. Infection rate artifact aggressively test, can't reliably used way compare countries. Death hospitalisation rates stable indicator prevalent virus is, even there's 1-3 week lag. hope right. Kronk? you? Fair point. think areas go suburbs within reasonable distance downtown. QUESTION: join military ANSWER: Yes, according Matthew P. Donovan, undersecretary defense personnel readiness.

u/ImpeachTomNook consistently full shit. OK, arguing bad faith, making assumptions. Take care. 86 deaths 84k cases. always wondered count foreign workers cases deaths. Supporters already lining outside BOK Center Tulsa, days president holds first campaign rally since lockdown began. coronavirus cases Tulsa across Oklahoma rising fast, local officials worried super spreader event. sub-65 excess mortality Sweden Norway/Denmark/Finland.

Look excess mortality 0-14 last couple months. trend, granted may statistical anomaly, given circumstances, think irresponsible optimistic. cost wrong severe.

It's going difficult Sweden start containment, longer wait, worse going be. can't go back time rectify mistakes past, Sweden huge outlier Scandinavia, really obvious mitigation good strategy. Containment much better. Experience shown require curfews extreme lockdown, require concerted effort government civil society. Voluntary civic action enough.

Summer coming up. best opportunity contain control epidemic. Experimenting herd immunity irresponsible, wish Sweden would careful public health. little economic gain reckless strategy. ideology pride really worth risk endemic threat public health? Literally barely scroll see article headlined ""corona virus stay years."" Half population. 120.000 people. Yes. It’s like we’re allowed 30% relevant conversation relates United States. games going extra innings, know it... even across board here, though. hear horror stories, places rental market fine here. NYC maybe California notwithstanding, rentals pretty reasonably priced. Tenant protections vary place place, part decent b 3,600 cases Texa yesterday. Slimy ass face! I’m pretty sure goal post always don’t let hospitals get run.  Amazon point even percentage, still sufficient you. reason asked question genuinely curious, were: 1)Making point data unavailable, thereby able throw red flag article general 2)Making point even data provided, hit certain level, would use say ""nope! everything a-okay!"" asking question data support view already hold. That's works. ask question help formulate opinion. realize rational thinking lost type though. Fucking stop posting bullshit.  whole fucking point masks prevent people transmitting virus. guidance expanded face coverings conventional masks.  ignorance killing people fucking stop already. Absolutely untrue. take assertion extreme, you’re saying long everyone six feet apart wearing masks, you’d transmission risk small unventilated room would in, say, park breezy day? 

Outdoor settings much much safer general. Anybody follows Reddit knows truth, still far pretty. I've rocking KN95s regular N95s consider elevated risk. 


But comment motivated order proper P100s. think I'll use yet second wave hits shit gets bad respirators probably impossible find point better order now.  


How often change filters those? got 10 pairs filters figure last even daily use right?? would using like 1-2hrs time go stores. Think pair filters would last 2 weeks used 1-2 hours per day? 


The filters like $16/pair even bought bulk hoping swap filters daily could add up. agree lot people saying people saying things like ""cant wait get sick"" "" bet already, idiots"".....

I want people get sick feel validated..... that's wrong

Also think need focus loved ones (if can) gonna convince anyone want take serious. yourself..... Wear mask, dont go places dont feel comfortable, etc. can't compare Iceland UK, population number, population density throw waves waves men coronavirus. Easy say insane relatives ones rely food, shelter, education, clothes... 

I fully agree, easy make sound. Virginia put one place May 26th positive cases/deaths dramatically slowed since. peak right order put place.

It's ***so*** frustrating knowing little common fucking sense two months ago would saved us lot bullshit. total dumbass base dying out... ""Turn fuckin' air conditioner, hot!"" tried posting info official NY state stats Forbes blocked. Why? think it’s based amount. 

My husband still making small amounts residual commission UI CA. commission taken benefits. One week paid work pastor didn’t receive benefits made benefit amount. kept logging hours UI back work 100% full time. got reduced amount made, number hours worked didn’t seem matter. Yeah take everything grain salt. understand places South OC awful mask usage, also understand places great! want optimistic, course continue follow rules. hope way able side mentally one piece. However, sometimes feels like people get damn *negative*. US whole seeing decline deaths cases. governor says California supposedly OK. far people saying seen spike cases protests. want stay optimistic hope we'll OK. want believe we're mend. Why?? fake, right?! ""When work healthcare...""

""...in billing department."" likely... amazing people even want take precautions. walk right past free sanitizer machines and/or wear mask. I've elevators stop 10 people masks talking going someplace. lag cases bit.

The bulk FL’s active infections happened week. slamming hospitals coming.

Look tourist hub Pensacola 97% capacity ICU beds.

A canary will. Sure can, make law wearing mask, jailed like break law! saw shit went New York. hundred thousand people died. 

I'm contradicting necessarily. sad this. surpassed Indiana Ohio worldometer. wonder National Guard called it. Wow going this. Please let true. From: rest world. agree - tribalism. worrying days dimwit coughing aisle.

Priceless. It’s young city. people 20s holed tiny apartments Craigslist roommates thousands miles away family, feel they’ve already made enough sacrifice. haven’t gotten seriously ill, friends haven’t gotten seriously ill. people see pictures personally unaffected virus, except extent they’ve lost income. Even living global epicenter, it’s possible feel like inconvenience rather crisis. I’m defending behavior, entirely predictable. clear back March we’d see restless people June. First never coronavirus vaccine made before. That’s difficult hurdle overcome. Second all, SARS-COVID2 virus genome essentially fully matured messenger RNA strand, 5’ methylated cap poly-A tail. means virus doesn’t enter cell’s nucleus begin replication, also makes vaccine harder make.

Lastly, amount people anti-vax increasing every year, something like 22% people polled trust vaccine properly tested cleared use. 

Even vaccine developed today, would get billions people? first year so, rich people would able get vaccinated. pick battles 

We live time people pick every battle  also probably net change.. subtracting recovered cases WTF? mean whole point protect others wearing mask. 20% population wear mask, I'm sure there's significant number people thinking ""well care safety, protecting you?""

Just fucking force students wear them, allow classes without mask, etc. like local university saying plan forcing students wear shoes shirts. actually already really solid online learning programs available. Part success though, parents CHOOSE platform, take seriously. set work space child understanding kid sit work online ENTIRE school day. follow through.

There’s lot teachers learn make online teaching truly effective, never work parents don’t make sure kid putting time.

Edit: say however, district put freeze grades soon closed school, think made big impact. teachers actually give grades moving forward, parents might step more. Arizona 3) finding box test results lying desk past month adding data single day :) going embers Europe. suggest closing borders 2021? People like unclean. spread disease. right shun them. Honestly, I'm sure enough time passed anyone really knows. They're seeing corona halos lungs CT scans, iirc. use name Christ spread hate. People short sighted - wonder still stone age. Cases definitely growing exponentially. wonder death counts near future. always say due testing people dying more. Retirement homes nursing homes US two different things, whereas UK interchangeable. US, nursing homes go die basically - residents usually need round clock, 24/7 care, can't anything themselves, aka skilled nursing facility. Retirement homes like adult care assisted living facilities - things need little assistance certain activities, tendency wander need secured unit. Hope helps! OP - Yup.

Source: Native Cent Floridian assessment What’s crazy knew dire mid-March. India! asinine comment possible. (his comment, comment. Thanks catching that! fix initial post, definitely $100 year. Official accumulative confirmed cases yesterday 83,293 60k. omg like sooooo many people tested yet. worst part statistically, lot mask people get sick enforce beliefs blown proportion.

When science, deaths, factual evidence pointing towards one thing can’t see it, nothing short becoming ill losing close loved one make people wake up. fast food board members can’t work fryer cash register. dentist's office one 5 6 people waiting room, socially distancing wearing masks. walks unmasked, tall, burly-looking dude, looking us smirk face. hear griping breath he's asked fill three-question form regarding current health status, imagine look gave receptionist told temperature taken.

I understand decision wear wear mask hill people willing die on. We're barely three months crisis...or, rather, three months crisis starting taken seriously. feels like many said fuck it, want summer back. individualist, selfish mindset, unfortunately family members fit bill.

And can't convince people otherwise. understand virus happens someone love. every day healthy, serves prove point ""this big deal."" 

I proud Newsom first weeks crisis, spite huge fan begin with. I'm disappointed seems like he's backing caving pressure throwing caution wind reopening soon. Issue fucking order Newsom. Thank that. Same. agree experience. researchers estimate number asymptomatics 30 40% covid cases. key question infectious ppl are. know wide-scale testing staff &amp; residents nursing homes LA asymptomatics cause outbreaks frail elderly weak immune systems. known super spreaders public. That’s horrible lie. Someone last job 31, athlete, extremely healthy, ventilated, put coma, passed within week. Multiple healthy friends 30s 40s got hospitalized. Stop spreading lies!! Chinese data everything reliable unfortunately. Japan data great, lacks case volume significant enough draw comparison countries (and that's great thing!). South Korea data also good, implement later retrospective view peak.
One country add soon Iran, second-wave curve pretty interesting.

France release tests consistently unfortunately. official sources weekly data.
The numbers display ourworldindata database. think better question states resisted lockdown measures actually really well ""death per million"" numbers?

Shouldnt suffered worse, like everybody said would? Actually Brazil going way US... zombie movies come 2020 going look unrealistic characters dying plainly believing zombies sufficient evidence. dare say something true. PM found filters?

I'm searching academic databases possible results still same: nada. trying give reference people thinking landlords jerks...I'm Oregon. also $100 month, year initially posted.

I tried explaining belief wasn’t necessary confused them. Denim registers uncomfortable it’s rough heavy. get hot sweaty way easily jeans athletic pants dress pants. (This coming someone see jeans objectively didn’t wear growing up, they’re 1 option many types pants could wear instead “default” pants.)

Masks register least comfortable enough ones wear light airy. still problems breathing whatsoever I’ve worn heavier masks. Heavy masks annoying fabric gets moist, isn’t issue light masks. Live free die. LMAO stay mad I’ve noticed lot states and/or news organizations aren’t counting regular hospital beds converted ICU beds totals, seems case here. It’s still concerning course, aren’t close running sounds headline. ""Possible."" muh freedumbs! That's kind thinking leads pregnancy, too. Better postpone entire school year get students back year. lead hellish tragedies. rentals increasing cost housing. investors making even individuals afford note can't buy dont millions cash throw around.

And property decreases housing values around it, people underwater go foreclosure sale to...investors. even without foreclosures, investors waiting line purchase cash/no contingencies. 

I'll never buy house without inspection. Investors time dont care foundation 5 years away crumbling. They'll bandaid ten years, sell another investor thing. I'm trying argue honest. doesnt take genius see getting 190k+ hospital beds wuhan 50k infections doesnt add up. Remember guys, U.S. 120K deaths counting U.K. 42K deaths counting. 7K nothing populous country earth. Ya true, guess many factors involved comes bad places hit.

It’s false equivalency. priest starts preaching protected virus, yeah dont listen. priest dont know saying. genuine question: 

How wearing/not wearing mask become political? reasoning behind it? know sister, people office historically terrible flu season.

I like sick, try distance use lots sanitizer. 

People come obviously sick. say, sick, go home, get much sick leave. respond I'm fine, I'm contagious, allergies, worry it, etc.

These people actually care get sick. 

Your sister one people. Even gets it, gives someone vulnerable loves die, going say her. going mad suggesting bad person.

There's nothing fix problem.  also healthy distrust medical system America, though. opioid epidemic constant threat medical bankruptcy huge weight lot people's lives. 

It's difficult convince someone received $4000 bill six-minute ambulance ride there's big healthcare conspiracy afoot. turn someone doctor walked appointment forty minutes late, barely looked you, prescribed pills never made better. 

I've resigned wearing mask least next year. I'm going automatically assume person goes without one idiot. many people taken advantage America - supposed know time different? scale international traffic (incoming infection) internal traffic (people mingling) completely different though. big change tone compared last month. think might fall without full football season all.

Thanks,

The Rest World 'tested 72 hours before' thing nonsense though; like can't get infected 72 hour period testing.

Even border testing really effective. researchers estimated tested SARS-CoV-2 four days infection 67 percent likely test negative, even virus. average patient began displaying symptoms virus, false-negative rate 38 percent. test performed best eight days infection (on average, three days symptom onset), even false negative rate 20 percent, meaning one five people virus negative test result. 

 

The point is, quarantine, risk letting infected people spread infection, even test everyone crosses border.  dare change logo favorite syrup! rotted corpse isn’t littered favorite logos never lived day life. want FUCKED hard consumerism.  Okay speech police. Jfc Reddit full Orwellian scum bags They've played massive part politicizing mask wearing. fucks cared iota people they'd set example. Instead yet another opportunity galvanize idiots pit ""the enemy"". like mask, hate respirator. true Boston TJs 2 days. masks, limit shoppers, plexiglass shields. Response good. think confusing word ""eradicate"" ""minimize"". Minimizing impact acting sooner something us agree on. There's little question any. Literally eradicating virus (as suggested) possible right now. Come guys already go Beat Brady twice prime Super Bowls. give us this! Good news: Math recent history say really won’t. Chambers Commerce every corner globe flog dead disproven horse religious fervor anyways. Consider source, guy. almost guaranteed locked ""incivility"" ""low quality information"" ""racism"" whatever mods make like always Coronaviruses tend confer long lasting immunity. little reason believe 8 months initial infected folks can't get reinfected. Herd immunity pipe dream vaccination COVID-19 likely need administered rather regular basis. would need n95 prefilter p100 cartridges already provide superior protection? Oh yeah, responding hypothetical American.

I know settles I’m moving family city took seriously.

My wife physician won’t jump ship, people suck even though don’t think get seriously ill, don’t like idea months mass causalities wife’s hospital, that’s going steal soul hate it. Major league soccer supposed couple weeks also. Aren’t going Disney? China truly doesnt give single fuck anyone outside borders 

That's wrong. give fuck anyone inside border either Even places like Central Park, St Mark’s, Stone Street nearly risky portrayed photos. It’s outdoors people mostly keep social circles. ""overlooked"" mean ""sent coronavirus positive people cared there"", yes. NYC insane reason. Edit: see alone this. NJ places same.

In case havent heard Canada 82% covid deaths took place nursing homes. New Jersey country part one cdc 



Edit: really hope joking leave yet?😂😂 feel dumb coronavirus killed 100 times less people expected haha. #fakenews Yes, think learn Japan, New Zealand, South Korea and, yes, Sweden. found best strategy yet, course learn. happy went containment mitigation.

As airborne infections - airborne nature problem, people infectious showing symptoms. elder care facility get outbreak. hard avoid. best reduce risk visitors, staff hospitals harboring infection risk.

This virus weird. high kappa-value, means people infectious all. Sadly minority extremely infectious sometimes even asymptomatic.

If infection widespread risk individuals unwittingly carrying infection much higher. Swedish authorities, like Danish initially, believe impossible contain virus, strategy makes good sense. think efforts rest world shown contained local outbreaks handled.

Either way, agree hope strategy ends well. wish nothing best Sweden. many friends there. least Sweden shown different path, valuable greater good humanity. Huh. noticed. Maybe mouthbreathers state (Nevada) stop blaming protests everyone wearing masks blame casinos bars nobody wears masks. Wishful thinking think mean Giants... can't speak everyone, I'm big guy finding mask fits pain. Depending move skip. awkward moment ""shit, touching mask good either"". Especially fix hand something register right after.

The truth often feel I'm damned damned don't. stay home much possible mask slips fix asap. like clothes, plenty people need different sizes. struggle. based what? look bad really bad. leader shit contain it, hospitals overrun thats terrible. high death rate say least low amount unknown deaths. agree 100%. 

The entire world focused vaccine basically unlimited funding behind it, likely one going found sooner rather later, one. 

It's possible believe virus serious also believe vaccine going found sooner rather later. Yep happen school grounds. murdered woman student attending classes school, killed walking car, school car-park, lesson. MD gyms opening tomorrow. nope me. Well sounds reasonable.  clarify, exactly closing businesses?  owners city? worked carny, made less minimum wage still got by... seems JAX better rest state. Cases seem going there. like remember believe dinosaurs. believe dinosaurs, must believe me, too. 

How one convert Saurism? said that, I'd like Saurist.

Can sacred texts Jurassic Park, Land Time, We're Back! Dinosaur's Story? early say. First actually something resembling vaccine. want research developed tested... We're yet. NRG already gonna converted back field hospital I’m guessing place turn field hospital next. Could bigger church’s like Lakewood second Baptist’s bigger locations? don’t know shit gonna get real. grading curve? pull mask run people studies shown projection spit particles fly much intense physical activity.  Well, pretty much blows ""it's flu"" theory water Except “reckless behavior” media pundits love highlight ongoing since May, cases keep dropping. 

I live here, I’ve careful, still go Central Park chill friends grass, masks, within 6 feet. spent first 2 months indoors. Despite activities BLM protests, still hit Phase 2 weeks ahead schedule.

Enough fear-mongering, it’s counterproductive. states getting hit late party rejecting common sense. Dafuq? Restaurants 25% capacity, pool gym closed. single outlet said protests might bad idea, weird. know.. fully willing months flatten curve, think minority issue giving year life. us living do. worst, people going get checked due covid? Lots people would otherwise stayed home leave yet?😂😂 feel dumb coronavirus killed 100 times less people expected haha. #fakenews Exactly. China ""succeeded"" bucket brigade bodies going straight fire 2+ months day night.

Idk pretty well norcal, socal though... stubborn mask lockdown policies. 😕 Nice job Nebraska voters. I've using 3M full-face respirator. people look like 2 heads really care. put single sheet TP inside (unused) filter liquid droplets escaping. 

Had one woman right behind Home Depot weeks ago mask. mean *right* behind me. Manager asked put one started yelling him... started coughing... sneezed back. Almost crapped realized wearing respirator. manager great; told leave store asked clerk call police refused. brought back employee area large dispenser sanitizer could clean neck, arms hands. also spare shirt car.

You need remember government care get sick; government cares *we get sick* time. cloth mask minimum use. excellent time minimum.  Likely rest insufficient national US response control public, masks effective obvious action normal people take make difference. faith virus could contained US without masks I’m sure would different, faith well founded. devolve much country.... bet Yes! don’t understand. Millions people die heart disease, diabetes related complications, cancer smoking, etc. going lock country ban sugar bad foods? 

I’m really enduring “lockdown” you’re right argument seems silly. sub actively cheers deaths infections whether it’s directly indirectly. It’s strange perverted.

First time I've weeks. Hopefully outside really really helps. Hope suffers. I'm tired people's bullshit. Tested positive? sick it? happened better person.

Well, maybe one.  "".... large retailers hoping reduce remove cashiers years. Whether move truly done name public safety -- it’s way cut costs -- isn’t clear.""

Since they've *years* - ie, pre-pandemic - *very* clear: cost cutting move guise ""safety"" $3250 size US healthcare workers low infection rate due better practices ppe.

LOL, no. no. many stories American medics buy reuse PPE? Give another week 2 moved county *coroner* elected position. Dumbest fucking thing.  Who's left here? I'm Lincoln Project. Plandemic? think really happening here? wonder ""most"" statistic Gives anxiety thinking it. potus next? doesn’t matter. He’ll say it’s like flu anyways. don’t even think coming back ventilator change minds. much terms toilet paper? fallacy repeated since beginning pandemic. fire raging Europe, people said numbers small better. No. behind. pandemic raging fire NY even testing. startes locked way could happen. goal put controls place, reopen try controlled burn would overwhelm. states gone full tilt without proper controls. People refuse even wear masks.  states' growth cases starting look exponential. Give months saying states waaaaay better. looks like may behind. Grab em hot spot! Yeah I’m paying grand month ONE ROOM Ann Arbor. Ann Arbor pricey. relate. much love family, 25 really want place own. We'll get eventually, stranger.  Asymptomatic means never symptoms.

This based serological study, done weeks infection occurred. Isn’t everything PR stunt Corporations Businesses? know places US, people around seem think masks cowards weaklings. can't even comprehend -- wearing mask, people *look you*.

What fucked society. explains friend listens Joe Rogan keeps nagging hang bunch friends respect tell I'm risk contract True mortality rate 0.2 - 2% 1% accepted. 5 million actual cases half asymptomatic. 

The herd immunity theory huge question mark. would almost million people die, guarantee people retain long-term resistance since Covid-19 hasn’t around long-term. Yes, Trump zombies. Nobody left mass gatherings late listen science hunkering down.  really appreciate thoughtful comment. I'm sitting thinking... reason would be? low intelligence desire show off. Perhaps common problem cherry picking Bible verses make one feel good decision. misinterpreting scripture altogether. church leaders seen God human... know. live Florida confirm. People absolutely insane. work grocery store literally fear life. pretty much goal every university right now. Get tuition money secured matter that. “Mild” symptoms basically bad flu. don’t think people knew they’d change anything. one know even gets flu shot Damn hoping would Joe Arpaio article. elected law enforcement official still though. Outside America that's pretty concept. Well tell fucktards wear fucking masks then. people idiots mess. Thanks R.epublica.ns published source, various press releases NYC less affluent areas, poorer areas (as expected). think would better tell public buy make cloth masks instead lying masks don’t work. Precautionary principle reasonable practice rapid-spreading epidemic especially Italy already hammered late February/early March. Normalcy bias US time time high.

Also risk infected never really low. R0 least 1.4 late January. Texas Ads video ruined experience. March early April. study whether antibodies last several weeks need data back then. Yes, read Merchants Doubt info. Incredibly important understand times. also hate wish ill anyone, honestly societal good everyone rally gets covid? really wish would agree wait 2 weeks sure nobody sick. already saw her. also believe risk Covid hyped media. 

So means household go back seeing family Science dogma, scientists may change opinion based last data. 
French authorities said thing, nobody complains wearing them, french president &amp; even leader extrem right wing wears public proudly. Absolutely.  CDC also. know takes considered close contact presumed positive case? Less 6 feet 15 minutes. 15 total minutes hours days mind you, 15 minutes single encounter. Businesses using verbatim essentially contact tracing reveals next zero close contacts time. Contrary popular belief, want right. already imagine big pacific patch used masks floating ocean know you’re troll, doesn’t even make sense. Ya think?!? tell trump Indeed. Patrick Henry would fall told that. 450 back up. Still showing 259 me. local media confirming rolled back. “Anti-science bias” i.e. ignorance. Let’s call is. Less 1% Americans tested positive: US population 328.2 million, total positive cases: 2.23 million. 

Of less 1%, far less 1% died - 118K

Of far less 1% 1%, 40% nursing homes advanced age.

\-Things need said. make lot valid factual points. 

Unfortunately, people like guy replying give shit facts. want justify outrage since there's real reason so, cling things like without bothering come actual alternative. 

Of course somehow governor's fault he's responsible decades (conservative) policymaking lead current medical system. course. People literally going die political misinformation. tragic. 

I even think misinformation much as... stubbornness. information there. science. willfully ignoring it. 3,500 new cases added makes think mario kart question is: would take it? even believe virus real, can't even bothered wear mask. would love take vaccine? yes. would love take vaccine rushed through, tested enough gone proper trial studies potential harm? mmm, somebody else try first? So...mask mask now? Hmm yea get saying. quite unfortunate there's much help people live half way across nation, especially people deny severity type people actually listen. Partly that, partly shutdowns. problem virus far expensive contagious mitigate.

- Expensive: somewhere 1% 10% people catching need ICU care, possibly average 7 14 days. multiply even lower bound, months years 100% ICU capacity nothing left purpose.

- Contagious: say want mitigate 2% people time, 18 months. essentially impossible 2% people shut everything quickly 50% people it.

Being laser focused maintaining abundant hospital capacity entirely wrong thinking. way ever abundant hospital capacity containment. sure now, got fucked Quest beginning problems. mighty fine mental gymnastics got there. Expect nothing less someone trying convince massive hypocrite

If people wearing masks sort consideration social distancing outside, risk low.

A convention crowds people inside (and length time shared space also important), probably bothering wear masks socially distance?

Aw military toys ignorance protect big bad virus? sucks. yeah gotta math whether moving worth it. $20 ain't bad. Hahaha fucking losers  number new cases worrisome, think increase cases mostly due increased testing CA. test positivity rate still seems staying \~4.5%. states like TX, FL, AZ worried increased test positivity rate higher number cases strongly suggests increased community spread. great success!!   hate Trump totally right. Pretty much. two weeks thing latched onto bit hard realistically longer see full affect.

But hey, hear, pandemic over! lets see test positivity hits double digits. keeping mid low single digits maintain safe level hospital/icu capacity there's reason keep things closed. able survey overwhelming majority disease spread large portions population disease poses low adverse health risk.

Well... dumb. I'm native Nebraska lived years there's 10% people grocery stores workers wearing mask. people see gas stations not...ugh.

Im disappointed good chunk population here. Interest rates also seems like lot people holding listing houses wants strangers wandering house coughing everything right now?

I'm moving year looking areas might end number listings really low compared times I've looked (Moving back area I've bought houses three times before). They're definitely selling fast. Even still compare last years numbers around time - although large spike last year expecting year numbers don’t order taken drive-thru person mask nose. Everyone inside actual restaurant wearing properly anyway. lol, dude could let 10 million people die still gonna lot people don’t give fuck. way people gonna care watch friends family die. Yet.... People point fact deaths flat sign isn’t spike, it’s indicative testing. case/death ratio currently spiking states NY similar point.

CA new record number infections Wednesday, likely come least close today. areas CA seeing fewer numbers ICU, areas seeing more.

This reason totally end emergency. Nah, think so. That’s thing. known masks worked hundred years can’t TELL people wear consensus English speaking Ivy League doctors says work one particular virus? That’s dumb. Countless deaths caused ignorance.

It really annoying subs like watching pretending obvious real. America going die hill, rest assured Hill stupid  username pretty trashy tho Fucks sakes Sweden..... that’s literally every anti-lockdown person’s argument. Swedes looking back decisions now. Obey Trump die. current trajectory Mexico South far worse... None them. 
All models failed. 
All predictions failed. 
All treatments failed. well understand anyone might die anything time

When introduce deadly pandemic mix; kind increases overall risk death, fool. People need understand that. really try understand beaten repeatedly breathless language, stops useful information starts fear mongering.

And people still get it. work retail Colorado time last month I’d say 90% people wearing masks social distancing without told. it’s closer 20% constantly remind people stay 6 feet away me. It’s like people think virus went away stores restaurants started opening again. I’m Santa Clara confirm wearing masks here. need separate NorCal SoCal data seems we’re treating much differently. hate /s They'll 800 cases come rally. Mark words. feel sorry single one them. forgot mention possibility Social Security might remain solvent Covid picks enough old people negatively effects life expectancy poorer groups well.

I starting think that's plan. whole ""never let crisis go waste"" thing...  Get married Vegas, marriage certificate Appostillle bring back Norway. let spouses in. colleagues done it. 

My wife American I'm Italian wants sell everything move Europe ! thought virus vanished April? IDGAF body. FACT IDGAF do, virus stays &amp; alone, tf cares whether wear mask not? entitled ahole.

Yep. suppose ticket money raised going towards vaccine either. Yeah, voluntary orders really going work, Compliance rate probably &lt; 1%. fucking kidding shit? ""Experts"" name political party corporation, they're people disparate fields, varying skill, experience, education, sometimes make imperfect decisions incomplete information. saying ""I'll never listen again!"" moronic. point, *are* going listen to, people actually know things relevant problem hand? I’m really curious appears distinction regarding wearing masks workplace. new guidelines appear require employees wear masks workplace workplace open public. Aren’t one’s co-workers basically members public since residing household? Unless misinterpreted new guidance, sounds like employees need wear masks office socially distance office open public. find really disturbing. miss Blimpies removed mods before. Why? allow opinion pieces Florida states F\*\*\*ed? eureka!! secret really changing biochemistry!! glad olympics got delayed, I'll time secure steady source meth great supplements US olympic track trials.

Not Fauci either; stupid double-speak message ""Don't use masks, work, also need healthcare workers"" broadcast Europe March.

Lying efficacy masks point absolutely reckless. Complaining ""anti-scientific"" sentiments among public lack trust towards ""medical experts"" tragically unreflective. Ok *some* people turn zombies like 0.3%. worse rabies, kills 59,000 worldwide *every year*.  first. follows. Florida won’t. Fauci says there's ""anti science bias"" 180'd multiple times 'Rona Go Midwest, see restaurant workers masks pulled protests nobody wearing masks. bet people survivalists. They're quite happy spend rest lives living underground, using porta-potty drinking urine, ask wear mask, that's much trouble. lmao many black people COVID killed now? 

This waste time float idea another lockdown. many issues publicly deemed important containing virus. medical community that.. efficacy masks airborne viruses ""new information""?

No, screwed up. admit it. outbreak Union County church...the local paper made reference videos church uploaded earlier outbreak ( april-early may) services outside.

that part casually got left article. Unfortunately, people patience fact-checking multiple sources verify see social media, leads relying distorted echo chamber enables bad actors bad decisions. Yes! waiting vacation subsidy’s start. It’s duty free American travel mask free parts great country! /s Currently Beijing partly lock down.
Who cares shifts around. hundreds citys. tell city lock 2 weeks next half year, big problem? Sounds ok me.

We've enough you. How'd get wall? know! When's gonna realize we're out-played tiny countries fewer resources? Part final 'Surge Plans' involve exterior tent hospitals, like military style.

Can imagine? Already enduring worst pain disease ever Miami, parking lot tent hospital? sounds horrific.

If gets point, hope open interior services local arenas, auditoriums, convention centers, etc. Anything keep heat humidity bay. maybe let elderly die instead trying save them. result pretty similar places systems failed. It’s sign deteriorating education system, much home schooling. MuH fReEdOmS lol, no, UBI, snark comment I'm going even bother. Tables supposed 6’ apart. LA County Health Dept spot-check 1000 restaurants open dine-in found half weren’t following social distancing protocols. Yeah, fair enough teachers.

Were bullied? hear you, supposedly owning land huge sink too. Though get bigger waste money rent, least building *some* equity pay it.

The downsides guess locked land foreseeable future, rent decide relocate. hire property manager what-not.

Tempted go bay pay hike. engineers know say break even like, can't possibly break even long run. Even costs normalized location (which aren't, Tesla PS4 still cost SF Austin Seattle) still able save money overall. When/if move away, money miraculously normalize new destination.

Anyway, that's aside, thanks info. fact even issue shows lost country is. Obviously conflicting reports CDC, wearing mask literal least prevent spread virus. absolutely insane people aversion wearing them.

If want country opened back up, follow necessary precautions, idiots can't even that. hate sometimes. 

Most countries started getting infected around time started see decline, since politicize every single topic, arent even close seeing end this. said masks work well anyway, touching would cause us get sicker. 

He screwed up. hard people admit? MuH FrEEdOms! - selfish assholes everytime someone suggests something mildly inconvient public good. can, do! got test yesterday waiting results. stung like hell bad worried might be. Seconded. I'm SF (Noe Valley) every time I'm walk, mask use near 100%. ""slower streets"" thing also great. We've got 6 city block stretch traffic neighborhood. Makes super easy keep 6' apart. neighborhood really good taking care other.

""I actively find job pay LESS money 40 hours labor I'm paid currently working 0 hours"" lot universities going online fall. might wait January since U.S. middle epidemic. course is, I'm glad said it. Easy, fly anytime soon. agree theory don’t think handled well. 

What happened federal government taken centralized approach gathering PPE healthcare essential workers never would concern people hoarding masks.

Since chance happening, put really tough spot. Look bad toilet paper hoarding nobody said would issue supply. 

I’m trying defend decision, extent understand trying do. 


As far mistrust scientific community, doubt would made huge difference. Instead saying “the CDC said masks don’t work.” majority people would latch excuse wear one. 

The solution needs start schools teach common sense critical thinking skills. many extra deaths attributed regular seasonal flu standing year year 5 10 year averages. We’d look data tests positive flu sample population get accurate measure. Also big overlap symptoms course well could large number people caught Covid thought flu.

But ask, what’s end goal question? Even bad case flu year, seen data supporting claim, amount deaths norm extraordinarily high precautions taken regardless whether Covid flu. Confirmed covid cases high still rising. hope get what’s coming them. Well, yeah... Nice. even wrote letter city wouldn’t make mandate nobody wears masks outside stores. never even replied letter. choice matter. 😁 would argue there's even tiny chance contagious (meaning everyone), feel obligated wear mask. feel like freedom means able participate society, society deems responsible wear mask, way exercise freedom wear mask participate society. try participate mask-less. work company team members California Midwest - people California automatically start 20% higher people Midwest position. 

Cost living taken account companies setting salaries. No, blue-collared jobs that's probably true, office jobs? Absolutely. Seems reasonable, although sure feasible. nursing homes creating sort isolation units recommended CMS, would function similarly? I'm guessing better ones were, I'm sure many others give damn. Important note, mean patients longer immune. least early preliminary studies indicate T-cells appear retain memory kill COVID far longer antibodies remain blood. also means negative antibody test necessarily mean covid. 

Further thanks dutch study blood 2015 clearly never seen covid still killed already beaten it, key likely T-cells, pure antibodies blood wrong based politifact link posted /u/TheWork thread, also [difference 'expected deaths' tune 2400+  


This means look back historically deaths florida similar time period previous years, unexplained rise year, I'm betting attribute lot covid. Yep! also mucosal antibodies consider. I’m sorry, that’s awful. :( want call ""closing things besides office jobs"" something else besides lockdown, feel free. shut entire segments society prevent transmission still maintaining many parts said shutdown even Comfort's issue logistics, army protocols non-COVID hospital slowed things down.

The Army nothing Comfort. Navy ship. supposed non-COVID ship take pressure NYC hospitals. NYC started shipping COVID patients Comfort required reconfiguration isolation. NYC plan two days out. 

""Escape NY"" comes mind. humane human lives.

There. said it. interesting life least. old wise enough make decisions. Fauci literally told us wear masks. would dangerous general public wear masks. late February/early March. 

He lot damage. proof COVID-19 old news. Haha again. argument anger lol. think that's narcissism, that's cult behavior, Trump created Cult Personality. 

A sizeable portion conservative party worship point becoming part identity. criticism Trump criticism themselves, respond lashing anger irrational defensiveness. cannot use logic get see anything else mental gymnastics let admit wrong. staying home drastic? China, affected communities welded shut inside homes army would truck food medicine. Wuhan officially quarantined one able enter leave city. drastic measures, arguably effective ones. simplest measure take wearing mask - many Americans can't even abide that!

That 3 months. guy suggesting stay home vaccine. 

Other countries able keep infections manageable without going extreme indefinite lockdowns. Look Netherlands South Korea- tested heavily, maintained isolation much possible, encouraged mask wearing, aggressively located contacts infected people. much reasonable solution suggesting everyone stay home full year longer. don’t think considering irreparable ramifications society deaths/harm health lockdown would cause. Unfortunately, rural areas naturally going slow spread. Big cities public transit hotspots. Large amount attendees wearing masks protests outdoors. 

There evidence virus spreads poorly outdoors especially masks worn. Arguing becoming too. want say anymore. guess people going irresponsible there's much Hope works better app.  Good Saying masks don’t really work ordinary people isn’t lie? Wow...

I don’t disagree POTUS lied, don’t really need apologist Fauci either clearly lied. 

If POTUS knew bad pandemic months hand, Fauci.

Hong Kong Taiwan masked since early January, despite high population density, case counts. US health authorities couldn’t consider following prime models, especially asymptomatic transmissions already known late January? Seems like CA learning FL. day masks become mandatory indoors, indoor dining drinking also become allowed. Nothing makes sense. I've many questions, mainly saving lives important March / April one gives shit lives June? 

Everything went crazy strict free overnight. That’s fantastic! look forward life looking something like someday here.

Do find businesses complying? One reasons numbers going dramatically businesses exceeding 50% capacity disregarding social distancing guidelines. one, including employees, required wear mask. 

I’m sure Florida, Tampa Bay particular, thought would happen fast opening, masks,and enforcement rules have. 🤷‍♀️

Congrats daughter! I’m glad day remembered one safety modifications rather surreal drive though. Virginia, governor mandated masks weeks ago. think anyone paid attention. People wearing mask still aren't. completely unenforceable too. someone say ""medical condition"" keeps wearing mask, even allowed ask condition HIPAA rules. restaurants allowed open 50% capacity, lots people acting like longer risk all. frustrating! anything said relevance whether post breaks subreddit's second rule? complaint order they're requiring 3 year olds wear masks. ever tried get 3 year old something want?

I tell mine doesn’t wear mask, he’ll stay home. He’s sick cooped compliant.

But don’t think anyone going ticket take reasonable steps try get child comply.

Another thing consider sizing masks. adult sized mask uncomfortable children. lose argument resort personal attacks don’t leg stand on. Looking data it’s trending Florida 100% screwed stupidly ignore worse pandemic recent times. Sorry doc, Colbert taught us years ago reality liberal bias. personal thing people protest systemic racism racial violence? Especially pertains law enforcement. lot talk Swedish strategy actually is.

The important thing overwhelm hospital system they/we extent managed (by giving Brompton cocktail oldest care homes instead oxygen hospital). 

But see price many infected. hospitals focus much Covid patients hugh surgical debt handle future. Man thought gonna rick roll. Bye “The public” hasn’t great job listening it’s something want hear only, regardless message. 100 percent. masks that’s takes that’s takes. I’m mandatory lockdown businesses getting doomed people severe depression. personal observation, mask usage City LA seems pretty high. Even outdoors. course, LA County covers lot LA... includes walking street two guns shooting wildly air Yosemite Sam style.

“Your political candidates name here.” look compare graphs site really tell bad response united states compared countries even incredibly bad response states like florida arizona been. trend they're following gonna absolute chaos start july think it’s Illuminati m8 That's true, realize family mean entire US, there's certain segment US thinks scientists lying covid 19, global warming, evolution, vaccinations, etc. Much family extreme side, experience first hand extreme examples this. Remember time March Neil Degrasse Tyson said Coronavirus experiment whether world listen  see authority parents lot people terrible parents hurt deeply. Isn’t great grow walk away nonsense whenever want? also terrible science education schools! economy tank too

Sure, bad would lockdown. How’s place work handling it? I’m myrtle beach seems half half businesses putting safety measures. don’t give fuck others go beyond. need mandatory face masks we’ll good. point play ""gotcha."" expose moral inconsistency 

I'm disagreeing you, statement could easily flipped around support side, ie, ""my body choice (not wear mask)"" ghosted day trip flight?  Would still go? Deflect blaming watching much CNN. much laid feet ""people faith""

I think anyone professing religion banned public office.

You've already demonstrated fully rational person. work gaggle turds ones voting local elections every year. go vote love god ones working ground dealing corrupt idiotic leadership. States right involuntarily quarantine Well let's forget word boycott then. go business allow employees protect themselves, come contact customers. Unprotected employee may come contact me. Yeah thanks.  Lol got should've! Looking Orlando. something inhuman get locked away humans. 0 fucken sympathy them. There's particular type person ""being person really understands world"" drug choice.

These folks want believe they're geniuses, everything world happens purpose, purposes either purely good evil, nothing between.

All media ingest reinforces one three things: ""you're one gets it,"" ""there deeply evils forces world"", ""we fighting keep righteous men power help eliminate evil.""

Who self-identified geniuses taught evil? Here's short list evil people: scientists, doctors, lawyers, people read books, black people, librarians, LGBT folks, immigrants, Muslims, feminists, intellectuals, disabled, city dwellers, etc. people enemy, friends enemy, too.

And thing is, evil folks try explain they're evil, that's evidence they're even evil.

This feels good geniuses: know they're right, know everybody else evil, know destroying evil important mission they've given life. mission God. Ignorance convenient blissful. Las Vegas open? 
But many ICU beds! said day.

And let's forget hospital beds NRG Stadium folks! Let's fill 'em up, catch 'rona, get stuck 7 figure hospital bills sake eCoNoMiE! cruise remark super dumb, remember sub going nuts said it. prez task force still 'don't make people panic' mode. Since research look prez's tweet 3/9. I'm sure hold responsible misleading public, since concern.

As Fauci's quote, thinking people actually read said would walk away thinking blithely dismissed effects lockdown.

The full quote: *""If look history, we’ve terrible ordeals. tough. People suffering. People dying. It’s inconvenient societal standpoint, economic standpoint go this, going answer problems.""*

If read quote walk away saying ""this guy reason people believe science"", can't help you. obvious saying worse.

If mad understatement quote prez saying virus 'fading away' WEEK can't help you. Blaming Fauci, legitimately great American patriot, save skin incoherent fraud white house going work outside con echo chamber. buck stops top. Agreed. Oh, know. I'm going hear radio know lot older people lean way. shit

Also lady lovely legs Sadly, 50% country ignores common-sense guidelines like social distancing wearing masks, infect majority US population vaccine widely available.

FiveThirtyEight make [great adjust variables yourself.

If assume...

* immunity infection lasts 2 years
* death rate 2%
* r0 1.8% (I chose conservative estimate, reduced primarily portion country practicing mask-wearing social distancing)

...then 70% population infected within 150 days.

On hand, widespread mask wearing reduces r0 half percent, 1.3%, we're looking 35% infection year. 

The narcissists refusing wear masks playing fire, could literally cause deaths millions fellow citizens. ""Fake news!"" 

It's equivalent putting fingers ears going ""nah nah nah"" like petulant child. Well, see... need make sure people get virus first get virus relief. /s I’m near Tampa, county Tampa in. Everything confusing contradictory start. feel governors want what’s right support public federal government. lot due scientists (a)not consistent, (b) making incorrect predictions (c) obvious opportunities profit.

An example lack consistency would masks. masks effective not? Scientists say yes, scientists also say no. normal person know scientist listen to? people contagious asymptomatic? One group says yes, another group says no. even scientists can't come agreement, makes qualified Joe Dumbo make policy recommendations?

An example incorrect prediction would lot older climate change models. people absolutely refuse listen anything climate change ""Al Gore said Florida would underwater 2013"" whatever. understand unreasonable expect scientists able predict future, everyone that's important remember deciding publish not.

An example obvious opportunity profit would someone like James Cameron invests pea protein makes movie telling everyone stop eating meat. makes different Philip Morris telling smoke Camels? Would trust Elon Musk said chance save world buy electric cars? Even true, SEEMS dishonest there's potential motive profit.

This goes way beyond coronavirus problem long time. ultimate consequence every time scientists inconsistent, incorrect suspect, entire field science becomes less trustworthy. people stop able trust science, whole society suffers. Yeah Americans start dying one wearing mask, then... that's good thing it?

Right now, Americans using loophole travel country infect people Covid. bullshit. 

I'm tired shit.  Difference Trump changed opinion face new evidence continues push dangerous lies outright conspiracy. i'll link website i've found posted discussion outstanding like numbers 

 good friend large abnormal tumor. fits criteria warrants investigation especially paired blood work. 

COVID-19 delayed biopsy.

Everything reopened got books August.

And doctors really worried consequences delaying biopsy.

The prognosis without early treatment is... poor. propaganda public schools colleges trusted turn kids liberal biases  Good. agree, response fragmented part, pretty stupid. lost lot ground February didn’t tests, political leaders trying tell us virus isn’t real. think implementing severe total shutdown vaccine created ignorant social economic reality United States. China able it, months, they’re totalitarian state aggressively surveils population. Imagine trying get people Alabama Oklahoma stay home virus don’t even think real? would shoot government officials trying enforce it. 

I don’t want heap much praise NY don’t know bad things get restaurants reopen, someone lives tri-state area, couldn’t prouder progress we’ve made virus cautious we’re reopening. think mentioned another comment people NY weren’t taking masks seriously, sucks, experience CT people see grocery store elsewhere wearing masks. appreciate we’re testing high numbers trying pass things like rent reform help financially devastated people. think phasing reopening, pauses see much virus cases change, great solution. NY/NJ ever get really bad again, don’t doubt may go back shutting businesses. think possible testing rate 1% positive isolate clusters contain them. Might wishful thinking part, we’ll see. 

As states like Texas, didn’t need open goddamn casinos bars fast did, made masks optional top that. don’t know many tests they’re running per day whether they’re keeping track ICU availability order see need shut things again. country, many us don’t willpower sacrifice anything greater good absolutely sucks. think hoping yearlong shutdown living Zoom calls friends never ever happen. Federally, need invest better testing, contact tracing, isolation infected people, border control travel allowed again. feel like despite reading everything disease, can't wrap head around contagious fast spreading disease is. smart 1st grader isnt capable designing jet engine. Sweden actually one best countries world correctly attributing excess deaths Covid-19, we've pretty spot on. get it. virus what's causing us earn living. Trump would put whole American healthcare system hold find cure would happen. Lol well brother Doug Premier Ontario (similar time governor) he’s actually done complete opposite thought would do. listened health officials really taking every death hospitalization personally. didn’t vote proud handling Pandemic. think meant global lock saved millions lives taken context. getting worse worse. big thing lot us concerned last election. know right. people get experience getting tie caught vacuum cleaner back Ford focus nation brought world antivaxxers flat earthers ?

Shocking. Shocking say 'ping pong' back forth, things change based facts peer reviewed evidence... Recommendations change. Versus yes, conspiracy theory shitty info. People contract virus kill others convicted murder. joking. murder. Well, meant say fuckin nerd. Guess spaced one. Even weeping angels taking precautions. course would. Lots people stay home ride bad flus. multiple times. could admitted sure went hospital. believe arena.... indoors.

Which way fucking stupider. seen case taken action existing rule 2 break aware of? can't think any. would mean selective.

Doesn't change anything regarding whether post breaks subreddit's second rule though. non-ad hominem comment that? Yes assumed 2 weeks. novel virus folks. means one knows nothing simpleton like doesn’t understand it, trust science scientists don’t agenda. creationist scientists agenda try support religion don’t mean much me. website 5 minutes ago said 450. looks like reverted update... Cult 45 , best . Ignoring science Fuckin feel like law rules like this.. ""COVID-90 antibody 19% people"" #stop mind telling region you’re in? I’m Central Florida. Ah looking link preferred call Enterprison yeah got haha! made laugh much ... I'm mad countries same. Pretending close eyes boogie man disappear. Yet still can't outfit healthcare workers, terrible fucking plan That's used remind bot. One popped say OP....can show find 450 cases? stay home wear mask. Going protest spreads virus. killing grandma grand-dad

It's rocket science. virus also big fan heat direct UV-light. Day 1?

Like city established?

Maybe day first Wuhan case happened?

Maybe Dec 31st China told world issue?

15 Jan case outside Seattle?

Perhaps 23rd Jan China shut built hospitals?

Or Feb 29th first known American case happened told stop buying masks?

Or start lockdown?

Or end lockdown?

So many day ones.

But today day 2 it’s still damn good day start wearing masks less 1% America confirmed caught CoVID19.  Unions can’t anything Florida. right work state. barely involved union district’s reopening plan. Exponential growth tricky takes really get going. need attention even though truly believe this, I'm gonna post anyways: gonna die! gonna die! idiots think go outside? putting lives jeopardy, hammering nail coffin rest us! gonna die! gonna die! fair, there's 9 states competing title right now. mean we’re stupid? take new steroid discovered countries managed it. Introverts myth. Would support ban driving save lives? That's banking idea already idiotic people office. hand I'm sure we're bottom yet. fear put work illness going bankrupt medical bills huge motivator take every possible protection. vaccine, i.e. unnatural infection, would specifically crafted confer stronger response body

Usually natural infections result stronger immune responses. I'm sure immunity strength/length something try make sure passes threshold. hope works.  Good luck. Florida Man immortal Selective enforcement rules bad thing (here, trying stifle specific Thats like press release thing. I’m talking order signed Newsom. Maybe wouldn’t need much personal freedom competent, non-corrupt, trustworthy government.

Are really going trust broke institution took crisis opportunity loot taxpayers give corporations strings attached, livelihood? 
The institution deemed head shops liquor stores essential town, closed food bank right next door shutdown? good reason people reluctant allow government take away right independent livelihood. many times Fauci completely done 180 changed tune every single topic. It’s insane. Dallas one, don’t know policy company wide. hope local leaders see wrongheaded best course action. replied Reducing cases 0 reopening exposing state risk infection dealt No? Dude there’s thing called immunity. virus can’t infect many new people March.

And argument large city US, second wave definition fewer potential people infect. Reopening slowly nowhere near free-for-all virus early March.

These two statements same, either careful initial comment changing position. 

I think purposefully misconstruing argument done discussing it. good day. Fucking hell finally. They’re prescription, I’m sure. 

In early days my, tests, people thought might sick told stay home wait got really sick. 

We need get point people tested soon suspect exposed, start things right away. 

We’re close. 

That’s important lock things hard early. It’s used write something sarcastically. Exactly. Sweden lock down, done COVID-19.  rest want wear masks years years... Try wearing thing 8 hours though. needs better option workers. pay $25 hour wear thing day.

You might able early twenties though... remember renting cars full suit 12 hours day soaked bone raining sweating ass 95 degree weather first job college (guess was...)

Actually, yeah I'd take mask. I've saying ages r/SLO getting flak there, check post history last couple months posting there. created r/Masks4All mocked ridiculed largely community. Overall hope Gavin's mask requirement something also still expect strong resistance. Texas says welcome rumble Years Hollywood played that. Sure get ""they listened experts"", C3PO tells Han odds surviving, know Solo gonna pull out. ""one guys gut vs experts"", always see gut win. may value instinct, Hollywood glorifies (because honestly Star Wars end Falcon crashing asteroid pretty lame, yet somehow still better sequels). bad treated like boxing match, lay big enough beating opponent first round even knock rest fight coasting maybe absorbing couple lucky punches. AHHH YESSS. WANT CARRY FLAG.

I SICK EXHAUSTED seeing hearing ""My body choice. scared stay away me!"" hurting PUT MASK ON. Especially opposite possibly killing somebody? sound like ignorant guys refuse wear condoms ""because feel good"" told high school sex Ed. Lol really? not. They're wrong. Someone please tell Joe Rogan knuckle dragging wanna-be fans. obvious it'd be, clicked anyway. Needed daily dose. knew disease known spreading exponentially would spread quickly??? Boomer selfishness

There currently national conversation one side uses false, inflammatory rhetoric divide, isolate, dehumanize American citizens: black people, hispanic people, women.

""Boomer"" insults thing. Please use personal straw-boogieman divide. Particularly ""boomers"" responsible civil rights, women's rights, gay rights.

The word ""asshole"" works fine accurate. Dear Governor 

W F ??!! That’s good hear. I’ll look recent tests Oh gonna good! Doom squad...ATTACK! “I’m bored, want haircut, want go bar, virus OVER!!!” - ‘Merica think im trying dispute whether coronavirus bad florida, completely missing point.

The guy mocking people recognizing need additional data points give context statistic headlining article. seems like bad look community condone that, ""pro-lockdown vs anti-lockdown"" argument trying make side look bad. striving best understanding data, including advantages/disadvantages metrics using. Increased testing vital. many different ways attack this:

Testing sewage outbreaks

Covid sniffing dogs

Taste/smell tests along temperature

Breathalyzer tests

This virus eradicated much easier mass testing. IIRC still cures ones coronavirus family. Things ever that's sure. Along racial/social/economic problems going 2020 looking like begining new world disagree you, fact area (central fla) really \*been\* lot hospitalizations. Brevard county brother works icu, hospital covid patient long time. That's liable change soon, that's part reason people become complacent (I include group!) Great news, cow wait 🤪  use masks realllllllly think it'll go years?

It won't. Masks readily available area, easy cobble together. 

I've giving long stares assholes follow law this. want know they're assholes. 

I'm looking possible methods, like handing basic masks *(cost $0.59/piece)* start conversation. push aggressive; temperament prefer talking arguing. (Besides, arguing tend change anyone's mind.) [Took like 2 seconds find article/reporting (this even originally stumbled upon ""116k"" shows reporting page. grand scheme things shows increasing, important part. say tabloid, even graphs vary based source reporting; uniform realistically be. yes, graphs vary ea thousand(s). 

&amp;#x200B;

Realistically, examples Florida firing lead data scientist well mis-representation Covid deaths (being mis-labeled cause death), safe say numbers inaccurate... much, I'm unsure. But, think agree it'll go there'll spikes point well (largely due large volume protests, memorial day, following CDC guidelines safety socializing). true, least early data suggests T-cells hold key likely retain knowledge kill COVID far longer antibodies remain blood.

I think points loss immunity, body may shed antibodies blood quickly still retaining immunity Good know, thank you! Hah. fixate raw cases trends. Well said! Hmmm acting like meeting outside dangerous? I’m sure means people think it’s over. 
        
   coverings required public spaces     
Cloth face coverings masks help reduce spread coronavirus especially combined physical distancing frequent hand washing. Starting June 18, Californians must wear face coverings common public indoor spaces outdoors distancing possible. Learn guidance limited exceptions here.

If people saw got confused Fauci saying, ""the risk Americans remains low time"" I'm gonna go ahead assume people huge morons understand exponential growth works. looking guys bought mask smol face? mean fit smol face properly? I’ve wasted money masks none fit face Yeah right. chose go Florida. go home lock two weeks. Guaranteed. (sounds like good politics though) Yes, ""waves"" work. Peak, valley, peak, valley..... know talking about, sunshine patchouli oil. organic lemon else work, i'm fucking sErIoUs, try cure cancers, that's got rid colon cancer. Lmao. fair, completely bungled response February defective PCR tests saying masks didn’t work. still haven’t forgiven working tests February, wouldn’t anywhere near bad now. get may hard trust again.

*not saying shouldn’t trust public health experts! acknowledging CDC specifically really screwed COVID Looking Orange County get program. Fellow Ohioan completely agree saying. worry good job closing early spike know plenty people plans go Florida next weeks since quote ""coronavirus almost now.""

I decided ask came think want know. put 100 Percent faith belief country governing body put 0% thought statements make one blame yourself

Well statements already run masks precisely everyone already knew going happen. clued fact needed get - Stat!! find evidence-free allegations Russia really despicable. many conspiracy-minded people seem love blaming Russia China problems US. cheap recipe many demagogues: find external enemy - even evidence whatsoever, like case.  Education different types people living place that. Correct.
Converted hospital now. ITT: Redditors communications degrees thinking idea science Hallelujah, needs said often. Time shame dummys basking ignorance. One benefit people don’t talk much 401k matching. instance company match 6% higher someone matching 6% Iowa. retire take anywhere.

I'm still major issues breathing running, issues never had

Someone told back March think may like hear this. Even people SARS saw lungs fully heal time, I'm confident see same!

Hang friend, wish best luck old Astrodome? scared stay home

Tell workers chose poverty coming serve selfish ass. ironic thing whole pandemic we'd handled properly (or all) nationally, would need wall stop happening. since handling nationally, Mexico might needing wall. Maybe paid it? Yeah that’s happened times. Ridiculous Restaurant customers also exempt eating drinking

Maybe table equipped computerized scales underneath place setting. weight plate drink stops decreasing steady rate, MASKS light hung table illuminate alert staff carry enforcement action. Thanks, I'll update comment. Something drive cost living first place. think 40% severe underestimate Pennsylvania weeks... parents’ neighbor’s son lives Orlando told mom there’s virus there. Better still: guy works healthcare! 

I wasn’t especially planning trip Florida next year so, destination completely table foreseeable future. state government stupid. Ty. trying find decent comfortable ones. ones thick I’m melting Houston lol. Meh. ignore local officials actually law enforcement officers disposal, makes think can't ignore Newsom, doesn't? Edgy really hoped making site up, know, goof. no...it real, click links within site.  go lie while. still understand flimsy piece cloth protect you. would love know statistics ""breathable face masks"". Kind defeats purpose. That's point. inspectors go in. Customers required wear masks? $500 fine. Second violation? $1,000 fine. $8,000 5th infraction. that, closed 14 days undergo covid training.

We issue health code violations deli wearing gloves hair net, this.

Science says: ""the CFR covid X"" merely information.

Fear mongering ""the CFR covid really high!"" something and/or loved ones might die!"" Fauci's broken cover past days. think saw knuckledraggers taking control again.  think many professionals switching working home, lot people want bigger space. one people. live fairly small apartment fine mostly used sleep day. Now, I’m cooped small place 24/7 end sight one word... america Almost 10% day day growth? see actual reinfection reported, assume probably then. going take away people rights protect people's rights? Finally! start policing it. God get mask filter pocket different sizes colors red bullseye 5.00 see. used different source. Yea different sources tallying numbers bit differently. People tend prefer Worldometers (source OP) frequency updates, would use John Hopkins tally since authoritative source. yesterday, John Hopkins 117.7k deaths listed: Worldometers 116,000 deaths counted June 11th: Fixed link John Hopkins data. Cali going face masks, Texas coming along. sounds like finally moving right direction. Hutchinson highlighted part executive order saying restrictions put place cities counties cannot restrictive put place state.

This going get people killed. constitution doesnt guarantee right earn living. Commerce forms left states intra state congress inter state. Really happy this, lets punishments counties don’t think much change. might wait enough people die anti-maskers realize bad things happen (and us) served Military, wear rubber masks. times wear 12 hours. carrying heavy equipment hot weather. also wore chemical protective suits, compare 3 layers heavy duty sweats. Wearing cloth mask 8 hours? that's piece cake.
Yeah know mask comfortable thing wear, means protecting customers, think make sacrifice. (customers included)
BTW make face coverings offer ""some"" protection little breathable. Trust imagine 30 foot wall spanning length southern US. border, walk part comparison. Either grant access phone’s location must wear gps monitor.  Also round trip stay less 14 days. - Semantics

Now, bats, kind between. Pittsburgh Philly taking seriously basically see universal masking business establishments there. Pennsyltucky hand exactly think would be. Fine revenue baby! lurk r/Landlord bit, lot stories nightmare tenants (not paying, damaging property, disturbing tenants) take ages evict, landlord never sees penny what’s owed, including thousands dollars fix property.

If someone legitimately wants pay back later agrees deal like reduced rent, that’s one thing. people milk tenant-friendly laws passed good intentions get free rent months, disappear repeat process somewhere else. There’s incentive pay owe unless try buy house years line unpaid debts come up. landlord takes damages lost rent pocket despite everything right, like paying mortgage/taxes/insurance/utilities/repairs/maintenance required provide following legal process eviction.

And wasted Florida gonna probably become next NY......

Well, shit tried...... this, masks. title simply lie. “10% Wuhan patients don’t antibodies week” would proper fear-mongering title Angry Tweet POTUS incoming........ Well happen work antigen presentation familiar paper give way information need.

Firstly, would put much stake single report especially one really looking cell lines. said here's thoughts that.

ORF8 complicated protein. similar equivalent protein original SARS-Cov1 virus ended splitting two proteins sometime pandemic, neither showed function showing SARS-cov2 ORF8. told found data evidence similar splitting mutations virus, nobody knows yet would occur.

MHC complicated molecule huge amount variation within population (which good helps us diversify immune responses). study looks effect single cell line would different MHC molecules, would raise questions effects throughout entire population. (which also could create hypothesis ORF8 gene got functionally lost first SARS started moving populations different MHCs longer necessary, hypothesis)

There also two major types cells, CD4 CD8. describing mechanism reduce MHCI necessary activation CD8 killer cells. cells directly kill infected cells prevent virus spreading nearby cells. Downregulation MHCI pretty common viral evasion strategy immune system ways countering it, one NK cells (or natural killer cells) recognize kill cells lack MHCI (since every cell normally body expresses it). seen data NK cell responses virus, also viruses mechanisms escape NK cell killing too, also looked yet virus.

The second group cells (called CD4 cells) activated MHCI MHCII, looked study, speculate based mechanism MHCI downregulation MHCII would probably normal forced ORF8 expression. CD4 cells important ""helpers"" generation antibody responses also help make CD8 cell responses stronger. would important component memory also cells found patients' blood samples pre-pandemic times cross-reactive covid-19 (recent Cell paper discussed lot board).

So basically tl;dr response would maybe. MHCI downregulation effect generating functional CD8 cell responses kill infected cells, would leave important memory responses intact. venture guess I'd say probably large effect memory generation since I'm expecting long term immunity CD4 cell/antibody mediated. It’s mask alright Early evidence, well remarkable finding Dutch blood 2015 killed Covid exposed it, suggests does.

It also suggests immunity another source too, that’s another topic haha Biden attended huge funeral. outdoors mask since started liberal hoax [Falls Liberty, blah blah, Freedom Movement, blah would also work. would mean hotels available basic quarantine centers hold people time. issue recirculating air system. apparently caused massive spread New York. Well clear. don’t need blame put 100 Percent faith belief country’s governing body, actually put 100% thought statements got masks early March.

You aware masks available public early year wiped Chinese expats shipped back China right? Americans know coming. Oh worry, God save all. good Christians.

^^^^^^/s Haha god truth objective?

Thus 2nd place towards reaching herd immunity. supporting strategy, pointing obvious. going worst less effective world 😬 realize ""only fair"" Florida NY Cuomo crying illegal Rhode Island back DeSantis destroy economy goof. destroyed economy massive layoffs across state opportunities new employment. mean read article say present reasoning behind works. I’m gonna lone wolf disagrees here. Vaccine production doesn’t boil technology medical advancements. lot safety trials can’t rushed.

Sorry, link work mobile me. reconcile data article says metrics reported? Either article clear, wrong, suppose. happy Gov stepped up, save lives new york starte good, think opened fast, really mess uo progress You’re extremely exaggerating calling covid symptoms “the sniffles”.. 

It may less dangerous earlier thought, it’s still extremely infectious, around us preexisting conditions susceptible catch it, potentially die it. think depends store. live PA stores definitely kick refuse wear mask. really insanity. seriously twilight zone episode.

Let alone coming someone able trust you’re trying convince someone know personally virus dangerous, like many people going through. 

Yet every minute spend, may well spend hour surrounded talking heads politicians trying swindle otherwise, usually defense ideology, personal gain, ego, even conspiracy. point think best try present case, make aware risks, refuse acknowledge decision free willed individual. reason sub bans political speech: ignorance -Earth actually oblate spheroid

The city failed us. state failed us. country failed us.

FUCK COUNTRY FORMERLY KNOWN UNITED STATES AMERICA. guy White House keel anytime. Fuck all. Anyone really banking vaccine? find businesses complying? 

Generally, yes. Larger stores often employee keeping track capacity/checking masks couple times I've wait go in. every business prominent signage masks social distancing. Inside there's usually tape floor showing one way aisles stand lines. I've gone one restaurant tables gone.

Part reopening phases regions can't progress next phase unless active cases/hospitalizations show downward trend. infection rate rises region may go back previous phase, like Cuomo's threatening Long Island. one wants go back full lockdown. shameful frustrating sad. That's funny think Americans learn anything this. Half population HEAVILY propagandized. can't even teach people wear simple mask stop spread virus world burns. incredible. Worked Europe.

There doesn’t seem justification this. one benefits. purposeless cruelty. indeed, partly virus real north oc. amuses see lot minority groups amazing mask wearing whatnot...then spoiled vapid people south oc acting like they’re sent concentration camp little modification “routine” Yes, expensive keep ICU bed empty, hospital systems try keep many extras around. big health systems US aim 90% ICU occupancy rate.

So even delay cancel elective surgery (and many elective surgeries supposed put people ICU), take many extra patients max ICU beds. Doubly Covid patients end ICU tend stay long time. hear understand concern. I’m also small business owner. 

However, due respect, abundance evidence suggests anecdotal concern doesn’t necessarily translate actual hardship vis vis business failure, closure forced sale. WaPo op ed cites bunch sources. one CNBC. Business News Daily article lines benefits higher employee wages ownership management.

Maybe make case wages increased there’s less skim top- maybe not- it’s undeniable take home pay hands working people means staff retention business owners increase number customers discretionary funds walking doors ordering small businesses. enforced who, again? can't enforce shit right - changed?

I mean, like it, I'm happy (I live CA) one tells guy Whole Foods leave... gives fuck Newsom says. see one two friends time outside friends hanging groups 15-20 , hugging pics. social distancing whatsoever. One indoor/outdoor bbq planned 50 people rsvp'd far. you. think southern states locked virus spread basically delayed inevitable. Despite best mitigation efforts, susceptible virus going get it, already happened NYC. Now, left already immune, aren’t going get spread regardless, haven’t gotten yet. However, sizable chunk people already immune virus spread much slower rate long doesn’t mutate. Read trumps twitter voice careful, groups claim scientific backing it’s hack four year degree works community college got paid someone. Whereas example, consensus IPCC trustworthy conclusion thousand experts. Fauci pretty careful words, cautious news media headline spin vs. direct quotes. cannot trust politicians policy organizations, unfortunately. includes CDC, FDA, etc. Big business much control them. you’re curious particular topic, help point useful resources. idea blindly trust scientist says, instead trust scientific information rather (for example) blindly follow political party alignment particular news station. Old donnie dont give fuck  Also Bay- people even wearing walks. Meanwhile work central valley like nothing going here- hope isnt outbreak here. entire countries like Canada US, populations exposed virus much logically think?

There's correlation fast food consumption. people stupid rejecting basic precautions desire look tough and/or ""free."" also allow Medium articles here, blog well. 


Im saying Forbes good articles. Rather news outlet instead essentially blogging platform. source meet subs content policy sourcing. it’s stupid, keep trying force us wear then??

I'll take vitamin K day ghoulish cure. WTF already got citizen! watch listen cellphone!!! obey, comply, conform immediately. Funny people 50 think they're going die, least likely people 50 lived life know risks freaking it. really - cases continuously rise CA entire time. strange deaths continued increase along slope (just delayed weeks), really haven't. Yet. would generally true stayed outside distanced One local GOP state reps trying get impeached know many people believe justified. can't even deal people. deaths per 1M population low

You're speaking absolute numbers. irrelevant except rear-view mirror history. Texas never really got cases per day control way many neighboring states did, compared them, spread much, much sustained. Look LA new deaths

You responding specific comment cases per day, okay, let's talk deaths second... complicated, hope bear me.

Florida several states including Texas started clamp reporting deaths COVID-19 due say concerns regarding verification. words, much stricter reporting death COVID-19 related, even person disease died condition typically associated disease, positive identification.

Not shockingly, policy implemented, states saw decreased death rates (but deaths reporting since rise, including Texas good week last week, generally rise week).

But look check deaths (and deaths check new cases) see different picture one paint. Indeed, since early May, numbers rise, like cases per day. Yes. everyone else wrong. Lmao. factors play besides economic resources population density. Vietnam slightly higher GDP per capita compared India - slightly lower, fact, measured PPP - slightly lower population density, apparently able effective response.

While population density relative poverty certainly factors, think India's huge linguistic/cultural/political diversity may important. Coordination various states central government suboptimal even best times. novel epidemic situation rational, authoritarian, one-party state significant advantages. people rioting streets beyond worry, enforcing even goes effect. could say ""starting today"" ""starting next month"" people wearing masks today. reason they're give businesses justification require patrons wear mask entering, even places policies risk big dust-up people wearing them. Ugh San Diego nice shit Anti-science? Since science become irrefutable truth? scientific method proving something plausible trying prove wrong? Everyone knows they’re mortal enemies. money cows, bats mighty scrappy. I’m even talking one year, I’m talking one *summer* 

Missing barbecues holidays (which many Americans excuses binge drinking) kill you.

As evidenced replies thread, personally think avoiding people isn’t bad thing! 😂 hear you, rational handle what's risky isn't. get it, do. don’t mind wearing mask all. car, seatbelt. motorcycle helmet. access masks, mainly poor communities, one myriad legal issues. good counter would official provides one put on. legalizing official mandating wear something, law mandating it, matter reason, dangerous envelope open.

I’m arguing people going Trader Joe’s don’t want wear them. I’m genuinely curious, would do/expect people don’t one/have access them, punishment would give non-cooperation? might sound unreasonable, safety aside (bc shouldn’t matter), different wear stars shoulder you’re Jewish?

And really, really think that. constitutional rights standpoint, mandating masks different that? argue safety want, lot others it’s constitutional issue. wonder anyone realizes kidding? wait American tourists! /s coronavirus surfaced, Marion packed prisons jails good options isolating potentially sick inmates — quarantining them. According Marion Star, prison nine infirmary beds serve 2,500 beds filled, inmates raised concerns coronavirus symptoms sent prison’s secluded part: solitary confinement.

We're fucked already, check cases mid July They’re obsessed going bars. pandemic, fucking pathetic LOSERS. don’t need sit bar watch Fox News 9 hours day.  Stop. stop. hope didn’t come like disputing number ill nature, generally curious. Seeing numbers thrown around makes skeptical time sauce. Thanks link.

ONE town population 18,000.

ONE town population 18,000 country 10 million people.

That's Sweden moving towards lockdown - that's rural town 0.18% population lives, closing public buildings.

But want stick alarmist, bedwetting narrative, call Swedish lockdown. Good luck, one friend loved VA experience man trip Many poor people live hand mouth require help lockdown. think could rock look. «He wrong guess?»

Sigh...he wrong everyrhing. still is. finally understand Swedish economy rots it’s neighbours? stated earlier mind much older people die, economy tank too. saying news people saying would happen back February instead happened now? What? 

Seriously, don’t bother obviously don’t clue what’s going on. unfortunately goes deeper that. people fundamental mistrust authoritative scientific figures. minds, science used mere political emotional tool control population submission...usually direction Big Pharma, secret world order, Bill Melinda Gates, name it. working headlining figures either complicit dark general population. So, empirical data show people immediately null void, tainted. hand, basement blogger claims PhD biophysics trusted, he's got incentive lie.  good one. also like one Gene This, then, new illiteracy, illiteracy read don't.

Most Southerners like ""Ohhhhh, that's neat must smart"" tell I'm neuroscientist. reliably make cutting comments atheism, views LGBT+ rights, women's rights, etc., get picture. almost *say* think smart, bigoted religious views clash secular, fact-based ideologies I'm idiot. think protecting ego, honestly. agree foundations science, agree incorrect much. sad really. :( Nobody needs “bar hop” pandemic. Nobody. ""It okay kill hundreds maybe millions cause just""

That's I'm hearing. cannot protests deal pandemic time. sweet sweet lucrative grant money 🙄 agree Dr. Fauci. see government totally irresponsible. could nip bud wore mask proper distancing get go. feel proper execution probably wouldn’t stop economy simple practical measures prevent spread. Science help us reckless attitude behavior hurt us. commander Chief poor example. think US anti-science approach western countries, people poorer lied often. Hospital bills make uninsured millionaire go bankrupt, course think vaccines another way spending money nothing. government keeps many secrets (like Area 51) constantly spies people unwarranted. say, many authorative figures lie achieve goal (saying masks useless prevent shortage faking declining covid cases support reopening).

Sorting controversial way go, unless cancerous downvote culture ends I'm pretty ignorant comes stuff...is going double every week? There's also nothing Ohio lol  Percent positive ticking up. 4% Tuesday, 5% yesterday, 6% today. Something keep eye on. I'm glad someone tell us things. parents kicking then. ignore times science used scientists justify racism, sexism, nutrition guidelines nutrition facts concerning food eat, sponsored studies happen benefit particular corporation industry point government using basis justification policy. news, sources reported water wet Small inconvenience save lives. &lt;3 internet brought us age misinformation stupidity. 🤦‍♀️  exactly pitching anything better leg stand on.

Philosophy learning love knowledge taught care earlier life. crazy conspiracy. sounds like 80% alabama point prove Fauci isn’t infallible. He, along Trump administration, CDC, WHO, Surgeon General, botched pandemic response.

I don’t care downvotes, I’m trying point truth simply respond OP’s question else Fauci say untrue. Unfortunately, appears denial. I’m sure it’s simple. Los Angeles fair weather overall, people haven’t use AC much year far, yet cases keep going restrictions loosened.

Think this:

More people die economic...fallout die coronavirus"": World Food Program USA remind of? Major world organization leader warns us major deadly disaster experts looming don’t change course on. Ignore it. Re-assure everything fine threat blown proportion.

Another major world organization warns us well. Currently 6.7% cases tested positive. Also lot state positives. you’re really interested here’s shit sea weeds. Like trees, old stuff falls floats ashore. Yes NYPD NYPD used excessive force people guise enforcing wearing mask. see rising Germany well strong economies far right party, 

Climate change gernel bigger threat broken systems world. fascinating. food, guns, drugs, cars made possible improved by....SCIENCE.

Its like people think living video game world shit magically spawns. take resources time manufacture. *lol downvoted stating truth. sub fear mongering cesspool

You realize deaths trending since April, right? let facts get way fear porn narrative Oregon 5000 cases new cases almost zero week so, two big outbreaks rural Oregon: one fish processing plant Lincoln county one church Union county. Neither outbreaks near Portland. two counties “responsible” numbers locked again. protests operate magic then? Good intentions create shield around people prevent transmission? Coronavirus care politics one bit. Heat means people spend time oudoors, usually apart, spreading liss likely. Plus, UV sunlight kills surfaces possibly airborne particles.
(Until gets hot / humid everyone retreats air conditioned spaces.) Fauci full shit. He's part reason there's ""anti-science bias"".

In February May, Fauci, CDC ""experts"" told us wear masks. Surgeon General yelled twitter CAPS ""!""s. masks useless. 

It turns lie. experts want public horde masks worsen PPE problem.

If ""experts"" lie us, trust them?? But... consumption already started going way shelter place enacted March. can't blame economic impact govt decisions spread consumer decision making. country 100% right people still buying things like pre-COVID - going blame shelter place? Yeah wonder what's going happen.

I hope family stay safe. least wear mask help little. I'm mainly Trinity. I'm watching meltdowns live local groups. People calling ""tyranny"". Lmao. end day, can't force people go even open, think attendance going like 40% best (if lower). think plan, think situation exists, probably figured ways alternative revenue options, happening matter what. Look posted - March 8th, imagine clip even that. anything started locking down. Sports still going strong. saying point, everybody need wear masks health care providers prioritized. also said infected people (implying asymptomatic spreaders well, recommendation shifted everyone needs wear masks bc there's way know asymptomatic/presymptomatic) wearing masks prevent spread.

Does non-N95 mask protect infected? No. non-N95 mask + social distancing keep infecting others? perfect, _significantly_ lowers likelihood spreading it. whole fucking point - everyone wearing mask, everyone would less likely infect people.

Fauci omniscient. gave best answer could information time. We've learned ton since beginning March, recommendations shifted accordingly. Saying someone lied changed position based new information absolutely ridiculous. love doomers are

You love nothing friends they'd talk shit takes behind back. ""Universality"", new finishing move Mortal Kombat?  wasn’t stupid, wouldn’t modern day America.  know presence B cells compensate lack live anti bodies? feel like B cells would promising/important Testing state awful first run, never got materials really ration tests. dad several friends coworkers boat you.

Based tests manage run, heaviest proportion positive tests around Cleveland, especially eastern suburbs. Safe assume pattern likely continues vast mountain unreported cases.

I still remember back March running first tests Acton Dewine told us expected already 100k cases point early ball game. Given track record, suspect right I’m San Diego feel like everywhere inside I’ve people masks on, outside much. don’t see many masks beach. Excellent Servers also come within 6 ft serve you... grew Anaheim. lots things do. exactly like living Amish country something. TLDR: may antibodies study look for, T-cells memory B-cells may still fight virus. 

As long many people recovered completely confirmed exposed virus never know. Immunity may last 1 year, may last 2 months, still everybody's guess point. corona virus, it’s 7 v 7 love poorly educated, folks! Think much money saved quarantine!

If people smart enough realize stupid gamble.

But probably resident state numbers going - advise Floridians anxiety smart, try keep educated numbers keep looking news every 5 mins, socially distance, wear mask, try something occupy mind (I've done ton yard work past months), keep essential shopping minimum.

I hope state comes around take seriously well states. NJ hit hard better, peak mini panic attacks everyday looked update. difference viewpoints think solution possible within timeframeof pandemic. I'm concluding front us lot dead people. even though state contained easily, probably block borders states we'll suffer almost much. pick Being. [Florida report percent positives labs, well statewide hospitalizations](http://ww11.doh.state.fl.us/comm/_partners/action/report_archive/state/state_reports_latest.pdf). makes easier. way slice get it, liked walmart less, first. Confusing. Needs research. 

Antibodies coronavirus don’t last long offset coronavirus doesn’t mutate much. Mixed vaccine 6-9 months.  That’s am. #wearAmask know more. make sense dear. 

There thing natural death, people die old age, cancer, heart attack, accidents get killed. 

Dying virus also something happens, fanatics believe get sick get sick die, let see God chosen them.

Why stop God using science? Infinite truckloads don’t know always way, cannot stand constant applause debates. get sentiment, feels like every sentence met standing ovation days. bye created reopening guidelines every state ignored. thinking today nearly pointless now. We're fucked moron leaders. fucking pathetic every major country slowing even eradicating virus except us  people really slow understand. 

""Has world exaggerated threat covid-19?     
- Yes, thinking writing article: ""A self-inflicted global disaster"". let happen, **it would now** probably lost many lives it. virus cannot stopped, contagious immunity population - everyone exposed. ""

In seriousness, right mind goes work positive test result country paid sick leave? True, free nyc test abbot test pretty accurate  Stories coming out. overwhelming data. Think # confirmed cases... think many never knew. 

The numbers probably around 18-20million total cases. 

I find less 100 stories proven factual searching. 

That statistical insignificant. Don’t mistake saying caring. full social distancing wear mask go 30. point it’s happening say 60+% get it.

It isn’t even happening 1%. I'm NYer. addition SapCPark's information, also, we're still basically shutdown. phase reopening, basically nothing reopened. 5%+ population left, mostly people Manhattan, many areas dense housing empty. Also, many people were/are afraid go back work Manhattan recent looting. pretty unsafe couple weeks. know people said ""protesters"" screaming walking street someone know drove Manhattan work throwing stuff car. make people want go back work! people know going back work fall winter. masks problem. hot/humid though warm usual. Yes, masks may working, alot people certain things want mask hours. includes going back office. means less spread. also family member go Florida week month ago vacation. refused see (live different house) let get close us several weeks. ended getting tested weeks fortunately came negative. still screaming terrible selfish idea that. article:

Among wearing mask would speak us, theme government distrust came up.

You keep saying asking ""hard questions"", seriousness mentioned likely crossed everyone's mind point, really hard question simply stating obvious problem one solution yet. also means big tech companies could start hiring people country workers would consider relocating. don’t think state outside WA &amp; CA really started taking seriously March. Even PA/NY one took seriously then. false positive/negative, body shedding remnants dead virus. articles click bait Yeah, people willing spend *trillions* propping economy wait high tech cures, yet could wipe thing tomorrow cheap, effective, universal tool mask wearing hand washing. But, no, we'll go expensive, inefficient way gets lot people killed ruins economy. cant talk kid sry.. swayed obedience fingersnap BLMing... reminder herd immunity work neither vaccines. 

Just reminder people skim read.

I almost downvoted post missed ""if"" first time around. Thought anti-vax post. know nothing Joe Rogan except he’s 5’ 7”. everyone knows, short people got little hands little eyes walk around tellin' great big lies.  Qatar one countries count vast numbers foreign workers ""population""? Presumably count cases, Worldometers might end distorted per capita rates. California really ""surging"" much. slow, steady climb is. Florida pretty well leveled off, things took turn worse, rapidly, past week two.

So one newsworthy, ""this changed"" vs ""this same"" sense. dead nursing home deaths. exactly healthy. also know hospitals doctors mislabeling deaths money. That's state reviewing numbers dead going never worked day Florida, retiree there's state income tax. snowbirds literally 3-4 months, happens fall election time, end skewing vote.

I met leadership multiple times express concerns (in closed office, wear masks). 

Last week, company finally made masks mandatory.

*months* KNEW masks needed fight spread.

I want leadership pay this, *know* won't, praised ""smart effective leadership skills trying times"". Months misinformation. Fauci trying diplomatic politician can't ways though, 

""They turned people away need housing, people would respectful tenants, good neighbors,"" masks? trend keeps up, y’all two weeks hospitals overrun. (Assuming people discharged fairly quickly). Shiiit Awwww..... 5000 deaths isnt enough? might 10 times less..

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Well, also think consider degree virus endemic community.

Ohio's success remains extremely obvious many experts one proactive states. shut much earlier initial surge many states. Ohio benefitted fact Ohio fuck wants go Ohio.

There simply much hidden virus circulating community opposed states like Florida suffered mass exodus East Coast trending up. partially shut one last states donate so. reopened flattening curve.

When states reopened, Ohio successful effective initial containment Ohio. Wow way viable treatment would think. Well, absolutely captivating analysis. People saying thing February. Yeah that's people would better full face shield thing happened 2008. Rent / housing prices dropped, everything got bought big holding companies, everything turned ""Luxury Apartments"" shit apartments paint job added amenities. Prices nearly doubled 10 years income basically stagnant. pretty much saying President problem.  There’s pub near live many people dining outside, masks distancing nothing happening... pretty concerned (East Bay) They'd indoors, isolated end shelters. nightmare scenario overcrowded shelter days hurricane. hear shoot anyone Texas feel life risk, fellow shopper wearing mask could considered putting life risk... Why? Also I'd love people raise genuine counter-points argument ""muh EcOnOmY!!"" 

You're brainwashed billionaire elites need working class front line harm's way continue make record profits. want know gov. absolutely resources pay every single citizen $1k per week LEAST year, probably more. Uh, thought business country, would compare United States. Brazil population 210 million. Arkansas. City passes ordinance, governer comes says enforceable. realize know treat flu pneumonia right? make vaccine every year flu. flu relief pills. Pneumonia antibiotics. ever realize relief antibiotic corona? doctors dont know they're dealing treat it? normal medicine always help? realize new virus right? fuck compare flu lol? know little virus treat it, harmless lol? things go south die, think cold lol? dont get chance may get sick know fix gets bad rustle jimmies little. arc couldn’t make without modern materials, equipment construction techniques. 

But yeah, family pre Bronze Age farmers totally it. legit sellers eBay ship direct you. Amazon co-mingles vendors' products so, even buy Amazon, could getting someone else's counterfeit.

You want find someone eBay legit ""storefront"" selling products least year. also searchable Google may website buy directly. That's easier said done friend. People dependent families can't always leave WHAT'S RATE NORMAL FLU!!!!!

/s San Mateo county opened bars, restaurants, hair salons today. problem even places lockdowns overseas, 'big explosion coronavirus cases'. 

So people looking places overseas going ""Why again?"" see successes without shutting everything down.

Personally even though parents died coronavirus (brought home rehab center dad) still opinion shutdowns everything sun unnecessary.

Mask mandates even laboratory eyewear mandates? Fine. Mandates ""You cannot pack people like sardines restaurants!""? Fine.

Shutting everything? fine unnecessary. Wait, what? Start amazon.com. what? unrelated?

Many members population socially isolated closures restrictions, job losses. Even 'lighter' lock down.

This shown detrimental effect health

Aren't health crisis?

Also, zero way people would want live like regularly .

In Canada, like province MB open seems 90 percent world significant impacts mental health especially vulnerable.

So im calling bs 'light' lockdown isnt brutal



That supports comment brutal whether enjoyed not. society live that's ""wealthy""?  California says, ""hold burrito"". Unfortunately, known side effect (so far) growing utter middle chest. However, plus side money would save milk. residents sharply rebuked threatened plausible action interests, safety, change them.

Oh heavens! *clutches pearls* tightly. Heart disease kill 2,500 year OC. 3 months, 250 covid. could reduce deaths ICU visits getting people work diet, **far** bigger impact making OC (and America) covid free. seriously panicked 46 versus 41? seriously think OC *worse* LA, simply snapshot ICU?

[NYT map hotspots United Oh good! glad hear say that. basically think going happen too. sure behind closed doors words ""it's late"" bandied about. would wrong. lock now, example, would still great affect could done much sooner.

Yep, feel like I've also seen ""we wrong, late lockdown now"" critical can't find links. thought recalled former state epidemiologist Annika Linde saying see re-skim likely candidates. FWIW article: really made think going course correct. Sans lockdown, though, say. basically, think lie low simply hope numbers get high can't avoid taking blame. quietly start TTI try play plan along - simply say ""capacity"" ""successfully"" expanded capacity effective always war Eastasia...

Totally agree. One already see Reddit Swedish brigade trying lay foundation: particular switched couple weeks ago admitting really TTI going Sweden trying pretend ""Sweden TTI Sweden always done TTI"". authorities also trying portray TTI widespread is. good takedown here: quite remarkable and, rightly point out, downright Orwellian. 

But oh well, long try something else, especially something else TTI least *some* good effect keeping spread/death toll somewhat happy. Sure, would like even better (with month lockdown get spread since TTI effective wiht low caseload, removal venal officials responsible mess), one take one get. important thing less people die / get sick, less cases potentially exported countries. live Orange County NC realize county made mandatory. noticed uptick many people see wearing maybe helping. Unfortunately, always people right thing I'm sure best way try enforce something like this. Right ""retirement"" homes, hospice. Depending part town store I'm shopping (not Portland), probably ranges 30-75% masked lately. Costco day probably good third loosely sitting noses. Bare minimum get store, guess. work daycare Teacher got tested positive Covid-19 morning. work closely she’s assistant teacher classroom. didn’t tell testing positive heard her. asked supervisor said HIPPA can’t say anything it. told supervisor already know tested positive next? said figuring right now. don’t feel comfortable returning work tomorrow clean Professionally. also don’t know Notifying parents kids. understand happened teacher didn’t tell upper management wasn’t going say anything. found last 30 minutes shift text. I’ve close contact students shouldn’t Self quarantine? Sorry hope makes sense I’m little shaken up. True extent, Texas particularly horrible controlling outbreak

No hasn't. I'm suggesting amazing, deaths per 1M population low, much lower California. I'd say US bungled Texas nowhere near bad many wrong. See data. numbers Texas declined slightly April began rising steadily May. protests begin end May / start June.

Not true. new deaths, peaked May 5th steadily declining ever since, following 7-day MA: looks like slight uptick week, longer trend still down.

Unless referring new cases, horrible measurement many factors lockdown slowed spread disease Texas least partially April, appears flat-out wrong.

That's correlation, causation proven whatsoever. trend that's important. Upward trends, especially hospitalizations, means transmission rate one exponential growth. uptick big random fluctuations, key. like Friday night

This exactly virus spreads best. point one-size-fits-all advice bad. mean fat orange narcissistic man-baby whose proven inept “leader” time? There's federal CDC supposed take charge matters like this. Ouch. sad. New York similarly handled extremely poorly letting COVID patients Nursing homes. think archeological sites came value rentiers actually contribute society? money unearned income. Right homes number people need one, yet keep price property artificially inflated rich people exploit working middle class families. Hundreds thousands people risk becoming homeless even necessary. That's pretty gross consider middle pandemic. live Myrtle. no, right basically everything back normal. restaurants close themselves, back open. one safe someone like physically wishes harms others. wouldn’t trust someone like act thoughts. you’re lactate threshold training every run, I’d argue that’s wrong, YMMV. I’m guy running injury free well decade. know 🤷‍♂️ would tell brother vacation Florida listened far, there's point trying. I'm tired trying help. think it’s we’re standards contact tracing. think metrics look good. Flat towards top curve goal - plateau, flattened curve. 

And solely practicing personal responsibility worked area society; take steps make laws 'help' people responsible - everything gun ownership pet registration. hell would take measures something important health citizens? ""Novel"" coronavirus indeed. italy ruled anyone knowingly ignores quarantine endangers others example spitting charged attempted murder. Makes total sense! Families flocking vacation throwing caution wind. Saw pictures little bit ago many beaches incredibly crowded. 

My family skipping beach year. Yeah, sucks LOVE going Florida love family I’d rather parents younger sibling safe shit.

Funny thing is, we’d probably able vacation EVERYONE TOOK SHIT SERIOUSLY BEGINNING still wear masks/stay much possible! no!! shit prolonged knows long.

Rant over. Well, football players impacts ability play game. everyone quarantined can't play. hopefully issues like season. Humans done though. average 21sst century american issue it. Nice! hoping would case. disdain them? 

I think they're wrong masks, also think feel lied to, specifically masks.  Maybe believe scientists 2 months ago caught up? *florida entered chat* wife (both public school teachers Texas) celebrated daughter's first birthday. daughter risk whole situation gives ounce anxiety.

We planned one year daycare / us working ease financial burden one teacher income may make jump year. things calm State still dead set plowing forward regardless numbers, wife probably stay home next year we'll make work. Michigan, Ohio Illinois three states handled best imo Glad Pennsylvania trying take seriously, even many rural residents agree Hope friend get well soon. first name private ask? 

Edit: Sorry silly question. tell better random guy germany wishes best long fullfilling life. hope ok really hope it. I’ve commented posts I’m starting residency ICU July 1 central Florida I’m terrified. go get nasal swab Monday (every incoming resident does). knew possibility, moved month ago situation much controlled. aren’t person orientation plans changing daily - regardless, long I’m negative I’ll starting July 1. Fearing numbers look like then. anyone read article. poorly written. also states July 17. implies confirm mayor talks masks. Well, duh. Ugh. journalism. That's first thing saw too... talked redditor Miami back **FEBRUARY** numbers Florida:

Population: 20,000,000

Population 60: 5,000,000

ICU Beds: **4,700**

Conclusion: **FLORIDA FUCKED** I'm trying ways, saying much riskier put new tenant six months ago. see people would soon take risk. Greg Abbot seriously unfit office, literally placing party people's lives. think it’s fair say little outbreak China almost minuscule write about. China whole state would probably rank #45 US new cases/day. don’t even think it’s newsworthy (comparatively) live Florida literally one friends social distancing could possibly go wrong? honestly even know saying... Chinese citizens, matter say Chinese government.

The important thing we're alive. Whatever say. one disputes that, lmao, go idiot. Dont minimize use protects others point. Reading comprehension asking much, clearly. WOW whereabouts you? That's insane. doubt incomes go much annually. order includes flexibility regards ""medical conditions"" somehow make difficult wear mask, order rather flaccid. anything like state, numerous businesses signs say something like: MASKS REQUIRED UNLESS MEDICAL CONDITION ^^^and ^^^we ^^^totally ^^^won't ^^^ask ^^^if ^^^you ^^^do ^^^have ^^^a ^^^medical ^^^condition.

In stores, almost 100% people time medical condition prevents wearing mask. Go figure. I'm asking ""healthy people like Ms. Strozier"" part GP comment sourced from. think unreasonable ask information came from, given cited anywhere article.

Did commenter Google her? research? Know decedent personally?

I disagree ""blame sick sick"" issue, that's free license invent information spot Reddit comment. Especially small addition clearly serves specific agenda... Yeah get you. stepped foot parent's house since March, scenario run got sick. think everyone's limits beliefs get blurry someone Love's life line Found Brit. Sort hit nail head. I’m computer science major also asthma, gets enhanced even common cold. sore throat cough usually transitions croup, I’m taking risks. Tuition also less scenario bother wear mask save people nursing homes? easily see coronavirus deaths drastically undercounted statistically looking many people normally would expected die time frame. town? UK government atm terrible. literally made strides prepared worse. 

They 

Bought ineffective ppe
Bought test kits already used
Bought drug help all
Taken months get testing even poor
Still antibodies tests
Left vunerable behind care homes.
Now this

9 weeks had, literally wasted time. Probably alot people longer care social distancing UK weird saw Arizona jogging Topeka canyon day Inaccurate PCR tests Quest Lab core weren’t allowed test weeks?

You’re thinking bogus Serology tests oversight. want extend life cartridge could always elastic band piece blue shop towel prefilter. guy knows best LPTs. sounds like new kind medication treat yeast infections. Age 50+ infections decreasing 50 increasing. anything that’s ideal way build herd immunity proposed - shelter elderly away let many younger people get possible. According Dr. Ionadadis (who CNN saying this), it’s less deadly deadly flu young middle-age people. Herd immunity way ends, best let young people don’t live elderly folks party get virus they’re lowest risk group. Oh say proud. I'm well aware situation fact got here. I'm owning fatness making change, relishing fact I'm fat. Fat acceptance okay, I'm actually huge fan Fat shaming. got younger years, forced least care shape I'm in. Yup. Part massive city - lot dumbasses He’s funny, lately I’ve stopped listening decide he’s refined Alex Jones. That's good them. hope physically close at-risk family friends. #Translation:

- great, wrong thought.

On Wednesday, news came coronal situation Gällivare deteriorating municipality closing leisure cultural facilities. appealing county traffic stop communications municipality. SVT reaches infection control physician Anders Nystedt heard latest measures, think sounds stupid. 

- wise. Wise action. protecting population passing spread.

In press release, municipality writes: 

 “We uncontrolled socially dangerous spread Covid-19 municipality. Region Norrbotten reports alarmingly high incidence infections. ”

#Corona test

The infectious surgeon also urges people symptoms get tested covid-19.
 
 - important. Everyone symptoms must go submit tests. exactly? punishments school based immediate localized punitive action like sitting corner, removal class, trip principle's office, etc. 

What virtual classroom? 11? Hahaha alone one meat plant got 650 new cases probably inadequate social distancing 1.5 days likely means getting sick enough tested testing increased, counted. I'd careful making assumption masks. NY NJ hit hardest first. Look chart pandemics. That's behave. Hit hard, recedes, hit much harder, recedes, hit hard. obviously know covid behave way, I'd urge caution claiming victory due mask usage. I'm definitely masks, convinced cloth masks without distancing beat covid. Let airlines decide fly safe not? Nah, I'm good. dont require mask I'm flying you. fl becoming huge hot spot seems :( Erie county here

I go often every time gone store I've seen 100% mask usage

I went farmers market Sunday, lots people, literally saw 0 people without mask.

I went vote monday drove past two ice cream parlors line ups (line outside) everyone line wearing mask.

Now people going stroll? mask, seen people walking social distancing. least noticable level. Yet evidence pile herd immunity actually better supression / Test, Trace, Isolate economy. metrics Sweden bad worse neighbors economically, despite many thinking relatively lax NPIs herd immunity strategy would protect economy. 

In contrast Denmark incredibly well compared EU average measures including one, unemployment, growth projections. 

At point really seems like suppression / TTI best health human safety, economy well. understanding news headline based quote press conference. think reporter f’d up, to
clarify Lol, that’s do.. kinda good news?:/ Right. I’m Ohio repeatedly thought nightmare would if/when gets deep SE part state, along WV border. Wheeling directly east, good sign starts traveling south along border. I'm glad MA. Plenty morons South/Midwest parading around without precautions. World class healthcare known lol. American people allergic collective action state anything help actually think this, lmao Yes palms super cute lots good food nice vibes. definitely cheaper 2bds nearly 4K he's paying now. Moving would suck right paying much 2 bed apartment lmao Hentai studios already it. Wishing speedy recovery. diligent mask use stories like help remind right thing do. 😷 Southern CA. Orange County, south Los Angeles, turned mini Florida. Due pressure removed mask law Orange County. 

But pick Orange County, happens parts state too. Sonoma County (Santa Rosa) group people protested taking masks time inside Whole Foods. [It's work restaurant least 3 times day hear ‘overblown whole thing is’ it’s ‘their right wear mask’. feel pretty comfortable saying majority I’ve seen Houston don’t wear masks think it’s grand conspiracy here, minus masks. added bonus told Wednesday back Monday... could find childcare two days?? I’m burning vacation days it’s apparently super important sitting office thing I’m home. mean, duh. can't fix CDC least January, 50 different CDCs.

First-world countries CDCs. probably one too. least someone let us know one. thousand people died state unnecessarily government realize federal CDC. even need study know masks work. common fucking sense. downplayed pros masks prevent people panic-buying masks health care workers need common people. one's gonna listen anyway. economic standpoint really understand second lockdown right now. do. totally get it.

I understand emphasis non pharmaceutical interventions like masks social distancing. making look like death cult. I'm reasonable human business owner. understand widespread lockdowns extremely unpopular problem, maybe even constitutional long periods I'm sure. 

But try save people aggressive campaigns protect stay safe makes look like biggest garbage fire. 

I understand one. Yeah, Shasta County sucks. Daryl Metcalfe mind wrote that, GOP members state legislature mess I'm sure there's slew them. No, Virginian plenty bad say WV... however, comment denote subsection state. But, seem pretty hellbent opinion, go it, WV suck. makes environment restaurant immune virus? know food shown vessel infection, stop air around things touch contaminated. There's nothing special food packaging prevents contamination unlike surface, even know likely common source infection. basic logic reason restaurants still taking extreme measures. Lax measures also mean increased risk employees working confined space, easily spread within community. 

Not saying dangerous grocery store, willfully ignorant seriously believe there's risk extra precautions like every business necessary. allowed sit side side restaurant, obviously mask. Nothing makes sense. (just drove popular place limited outdoor seating narrow sidewalk tables super close together people trying walk well. We're Europe, large plazas restaurants). want go Ohio. lol family there. It’s okay corn field... mean state. Yes, that’s trying get at, poorly. would mean spike would likely 2-6 weeks double incubation time time takes symptoms worsen enough seek test. course test due random testing whatever done states, think many people still tested symptoms. that’s still case, we’ll see delayed spike Fair enough, general discourse face mask almost always means cloth mask, specify n95 that’s mean. 2011, WV's average NAEP science scores par Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, New York within 2 points national average.  
In fact, 8th graders scored almost 10 points higher average California. 4th graders scored 12 points higher. Golden State must really pushing ""Science Devil"" agenda hard. Wow looking problem coming wildly different conclusions.

No, solution CDC bungling things 50 different CDCs, solution fix already existing CDC, elect executive branch sabotage action might make president look slightly bad. hear one person say need wear mask they're ""healthy"", I'm going scream. agree. Never said that. even close said. wise. probably stupid question, safe would right take job lab assistant? ""Preparing patient specimens"" part job description mostly seems like loading instruments clerical work. also know lab would processing COVID-19 tests not. diseases, infected pretty much showing symptoms right away.

That's entirely true.

It take four days show symptoms influenza, coronaviruses take least seven. 14-day maximum SARS-CoV-2 entirely ordinary. shedding viruses presymptomatic asymptomatic, well. Hello mate missed Witcher 3 sub anti-science, anti-expertise. many areas US, people treat opinions opinions, even one coming expert someone idea they're talking about. really like NYT's Corona Map interactives making people wear them? Yeah. worst part Council Members found quite reasonable reversed mask requirement! lol whoops looks like proved point. date symptoms usually 8 days hospitalization, another week 10 days death recovery.  first cases go up, hospital usage, deaths. happen once. [Carl Governor DeSantis: one could seen coming! Whoops, actually think it’s huge number! Lancet article link posted: 

""Robust randomised trials needed better inform evidence interventions""

Now take look following studies 2009 2020 regarding mask use similar respiratory illnesses. medical profressional claim expert layman seems like lot data back claim masks particularly effective.

Jacobs, J. L. et al. (2009) “Use surgical face masks reduce incidence common cold among health care workers Japan: randomized controlled trial,” American Journal Infection Control, Volume 37, Issue 5, 417 – health-care workers (HCW) significantly likely experience headaches. Face mask use HCW demonstrated provide benefit terms cold symptoms getting colds.

Cowling, B. et al. (2010) “Face masks prevent transmission influenza virus: systematic review,” Epidemiology Infection, 138(4), studies reviewed showed benefit wearing mask, either HCW community members households (H). See summary Tables 1 2 therein.

bin-Reza et al. (2012) “The use masks respirators prevent transmission influenza: systematic review scientific evidence,” Influenza Respiratory Viruses 6(4), 17 eligible studies. … None studies established conclusive relationship mask/respirator use protection influenza infection.”

Smith, J.D. et al. (2016) “Effectiveness N95 respirators versus surgical masks protecting health care workers acute respiratory infection: systematic review meta-analysis,” CMAJ Mar identified six clinical studies … . meta-analysis clinical studies, found significant difference N95 respirators surgical masks associated risk (a) laboratory-confirmed respiratory infection, (b) influenza-like illness, (c) reported work-place absenteeism.”

Offeddu, V. et al. (2017) “Effectiveness Masks Respirators Respiratory Infections Healthcare Workers: Systematic Review Meta-Analysis,” Clinical Infectious Diseases, Volume 65, Issue 11, 1 December 2017, Pages assessment clinical outcomes prone bias. Evidence protective effect masks respirators verified respiratory infection (VRI) statistically significant”.

Radonovich, L.J. et al. (2019) “N95 Respirators vs Medical Masks Preventing Influenza Among Health Care Personnel: Randomized Clinical Trial,” JAMA. 2019; 322(9): 2862 randomized participants, 2371 completed study accounted 5180 HCW-seasons. ... Among outpatient health care personnel, N95 respirators vs medical masks worn participants trial resulted significant difference incidence laboratory-confirmed influenza.”

Long, Y. et al. (2020) “Effectiveness N95 respirators versus surgical masks influenza: systematic review meta-analysis,” J Evid Based Med. 2020; 1- total six RCTs involving 9,171 participants included. statistically significant differences preventing laboratory-confirmed influenza, laboratory-confirmed respiratory viral infections, laboratory-confirmed respiratory infection, influenza-like illness using N95 respirators surgical masks. Meta-analysis indicated protective effect N95 respirators laboratory-confirmed bacterial colonization (RR = 0.58, 95% CI 0.43-0.78). use N95 respirators compared surgical masks associated lower risk laboratory-confirmed influenza.”

Edit: fixed broken link Exactly, kn95 matter fog glasses feel air flowing throat. I'm big proponent covid passes thru surfaces touching contaminated mask probably bad idea. respirator get perfect fit never touch possibly contaminated filters. agree. lived abroad long time felt. moved back USA 2016 wasn’t sure right not. realize yeah, pretty fair assessment things. people great value really backwards weak, willfully helpless entitled. Good what?  Small landlord here. two types renters can't pay. 

The first type open what's going can, sort payment plan/agreement. Even small amount paid, still agreement happy working them. 

The second type renters think funny can't evicted trying make lives hell. The, ""Ha Ha can't evict me, suck it"" type mentality.... absurd, infuriating steps harassment. think funny they're paying lately trying get tenants get paying. 

If evictions open plan going second type renter fullest. first type take much time need. matter job title people have, basic decency hard come by.  hard wear mask like fuck cover face that’s right bill rights! ferd-teenth amendment ""yall dont wear masks"" even states taking less precautions rising cases. NJ case absolutely awful started early everything ramping info place (more now). FL, AZ, etc. now? They'll end worse situation even though info time prep.  vested interest money health forgot /s Eat dick. enforced



Psy...duck? Land free. Home bla bla bla. Russ Diamond one worst things happen area while.  also disqualified saying masks don’t really work ordinary people shouldn’t wear them: Seems book. many American men, appearing 'tough' daily burden. scientist working together conspiracy, millions scientists working together mislead us  Since ask questions....what suggest? pretty sure foil real foils mention check source 5g blocking USB crystals. Hhmm Lol cover mouth wash hands. kindergarten level stuff here. Or, better yet, stay home you’re offended. Fauci still here? okay nobody forcing comment reddit. hope one day find intestinal fortitude discussions without directly insulting commentors like generally acting like child. live redneck county Northern California. one here, besides us actually value lives community, wear masks “MuH fReEdOm.” hate checking Covid stats locals always post bullshit diatribe care others. hope get fined. plan, according NFL Network, test players COVID-19 three times per week isolate anybody tests positive. NFLPA medical director Thom Mayer reportedly told player agents ""there’s 90 percent chance reliable saliva testing (will be) available players return facilities.""

One thing concerns players NFL NBA testing isn’t effective contact quarantining. question out, danger virus spreading increases, thus jeopardizing players. idea behind frequent testing good one, it’s less safe contact quarantining. (3 times per week plus false negatives equals risk) think human psychology think emergency decreasing months, going stay trajectory.

The truth is, even president multiple influential officials got TV today said, ""a second peak happening, everyone needs take seriously"" people would still acting extremely casually. worst part messaging. said yesterday Coronavirus ""dying out"" nearly opposite. mixed messaging severely hurting general public's ability take seriously. H-mart, 99 Ranch Jusgo enforcing masks spraying carts giving employees PPE way back mid-March, literally like *months* Trader Joes, HEB Costco. quickly searched google found, “the average age participants moved nursing home 83. average length stay death 13.6 months, median 5 months. 53% nursing home residents study died within six months.”

I haven’t really researched knows it’s true. is, numbers don’t really seem alarming. Source? Casinos=Nevada’s economy
Casinos= majority Nevada’s employment 

I don’t agree that’s open.

Also fact casino owners pressuring governor. live, really option wanted stay business. stores always way crowded grocery goddammit Karens Actually lol.. number illnesses show preference blood type No, listen people expertise subject. happens majority us agree sentiment. Everyone else seems fully charged straw men arguments think ads validity *opinions*. Obviously numbers continue climb near term. deniers still trying nonsense increased testing thing behind increase cases. rate, areas sufficient numbers cases stress hospital systems distant future, deniers move goalposts. Frankly governor deserves it. never bad wish people get act like this. Best tell lust greed power need work shop less crowded, cleaner places invade others personal space, I’ll take much longer year! packed indoor RNC convention FL seems like disaster waiting happen. Let know live avoid seeing that. eyes! 😳 Improperly wearing mask better none all, say? (Through mouth) breathing, droplets talking, coughing, laughing still stopped, yes? I'm saying need criticize people trying, least. That's understandable. think could handled differently.

 people wore masks, healthcare workers would treating less patients. lose lose. Austin's listening. Rest state care less. Good case wearing masks, well well well.... isn’t NBA going games Orlando soon? Seems like bad idea. You’ve never heard real estate investor lost everything?

Yes, actually lose money this. risk effort involved, despite people claim. risk-free easy, literally everybody would it.  argument nuance lead wholesale rejection expert analysis. agree that. Nah fuck seniors state. ones voted dumbass in. People shouldn’t spit people’s faces. However, one biggest scams American history.

I also live SD complete BS. get shamed everywhere wearing mask. Everyone wears masks public. It’s really dumb. People power tripping.

0.26% chance death coronavirus. Look up. 0.05% 50. Time open eyes people. Tell contact tracers cannot ask protests. Data shows impact protests. Mission accomplished. makes sense. Demanding 70% increase seems crazy, particularly interest rates went 0 there's market reason increase prices. landlords expect find new tenants they're going charge much? I'm Northwest Arkansas, see poor mask usage. Maybe 20-40% people wear definitely 50-50. lot young people out, like nothing going on. Young people, especially young white frat bro types go state university here, can't fucked wear mask, lot traveling back forth Dallas since huge number students there. Unsurprisingly, case count soaring since state opened bars patios packed. would certainly help. want central storage material etc, bought, stored maintained different countries? Fo also mean hospital care, ICU beds etc quantity quality across different nations? so, would ECDC achieve this? 

Anything else ECDC could provide? Lol! accept honorary gold spirit. 😊 Ive keeping eye like vulture, they'll fall eventually Give liberty give COVID-19!!! local Stater Bros, one security guard front another walking around store. Last time man took mask inside fit asked leave. Rural area, Sadly right. place blame deaths him. isn’t deaths irrevocable changes lives infected suffered devastating consequences like younger individuals risk factors ending life debilitating strokes. 

The scale devastation virus beyond would happened competent leader White House. hope businesses enforce rules. WeWork office LA area seem one wears mask even though posted rule building WeWork. Staff too. I'm sure point I'll cancel move office address I'm paying thousands indefinitely office I'm safe in. forgot Easter! 🐣

Feels like decades ago Go pretty much small town Facebook pages California. filled comments people insisting virus hoax time insisting “HCQ +zinc” cure “do research” responding posts saying FDA removed approval “fake news.” 

There lot stupid people California also make cheap toys electronic garbages, don't. weeks followed March 25 order, COVID-19 tore New York state’s nursing facilities, killing 6,000 people — 6% 100,000 nursing home States issued orders similar Cuomo’s recorded comparably grim outcomes. Michigan lost 5% roughly 38,000 nursing home residents COVID-19 since outbreak began. New Jersey lost 12% 43,000 Florida, transfers barred, 1.6% 73,000 nursing home residents died virus. California, initially moving toward policy like New York’s, quickly revised it. far, lost 2% 103,000 nursing home residents. bunch morons absolutely refuse wear masks want go business virus exist. small landlord number offers I've gotten last two months newly created LLCs tied investment companies astronomical. especially interesting also tenant building recently bought similar LLC tied large investment firm. rent raised. small landlord know raised rents. I’m tired. Get fucked 2020 ride. We'll start building walls around certain states county still tourism doesn’t require ask wearing....we largest spike cases day (20) figured case fancy word. I'm usually weirdo corrects spelling one stood me. think ""fain"" sort archaic. sounds like something D&amp;D character would say. Deaths [holding pretty steady despite fact cases rising consistently entire time. School shootings expected part life America -

and fact still leaves rest world incredulous. shitty start realize country laughing stock world cases. one especially. Never think freedom rights would lead THIS. god that's shocking..../s That’s dream Makes sense, people parroting two weeks shit reason since beginning doubling rate something like 17-21 days. still account people getting tested testing backlog may have. 

Most likely takes month see real effects went changes made. Human locusts Abbott. mostly old money owns property Bay Area, SF. new money, Gen X-ers older Millennials nearing 40 making combined income $300k+/year. child, skip trip. child, call CPS parents. putting danger. Kind never situation. live NYC, vast majority people still wear masks grocery stores I'd say least half people see wear outside (there's honestly reason wear one walking within close proximity people sidewalk). Despite protests (which started 3 weeks ago) cases deaths dropping every day. writer needs fuck off. two addresses, main one SF get SF salary huh could seen coming /s wear mask. do, socially distance don’t go unless necessary effort stop spread 

It’s subsidize failures state.

I set fair rates level make rentals free months time.

I’m going boot anyone now, I’m taking risk again. live losing renters new renters pay less, hook speedy repair things homes getting rent? thanks.

And preserve fair rates renting lowest risk renters, used high credit scores good references, include serve military. really said? people denial existence virus? Claiming deaths fake? guess counting vaccine early 2021. Happy cake day! Trump agree this! guess : Banks giving reprieve means another liquidity crunch across global markets. Adding jet fuel economic fire. huge draw backs solution. home depot great too. morning chant ""H.O.M.E. D.E.P.O.T.!"" also yearly ""don't unionize, take care already"" meetings would tell us one store canada unionized closed. cracks got Hispanics work freak Chinese *Americans* possible vector CV really, Hispanics who've contracting highest rates. Asians yet break double digits California. 

Morons need get shit together first. working well ? fuck still consideration? mandated 4 months ago. Uh allowed wear mask? old you? show up.


 time rational people country start mean treat idiots like make realize they're idiots...
Unfortunately people sheep see others ok it. 

I put mask go check mail nosy neighbors see one person wearing it. Fucking hive minded bunch.


 We've way tolerant backwards thinking got stop costs us everything. Yes. Give year five years 25% developer/IT jobs offshored like call centers 90s way see coming..... Imagine almost landing runway closed maintenance going around once. Hmm. Garuda things. Would appreciate feedback suggestions improving. No. Mostly swallow glass. distribute beer restaurants/bars/liquor stores/gyms/grocery stores cal.

The restaurants open awhile simply getting lax sanitizing protocols, mask usage social distancing.

The bars opening cess pool. bartenders going get real soon hadn’t already gotten shutdown.

Liquor stores people social distance cashiers stopped wearing masks weeks ago.

Grocery stores trying hard, it’s damn impossible keep people safe.

Gyms starting open, area couple weeks out. seen ingenious ideas stop spread put together. end simply put, gyms cess pools.

This getting spikes cases two weeks spikes deaths. go. daily dose ""humans dumb"" time, Florida Arizona rally Juneteenth. brave man, making stand cost constituents. Good luck! change whole life. realize people need work starve ""A stupid hill die on"" basically party position many, many issues 39% country. murder hornets lock go government officials health officials mean, believe coronavirus vaccine cause lifelong negative side effects, you’ve got believe virus same.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* far truly know who’s approach saved lives/did least damage via lockdowns etc. years come. please, give rest. still waiting “everybody caught virus found out” notice... ugh virus nightmare Hahahahahahahahahaha ""We're together"" take give many people. You’re right. certain blood type deemed less likely infection, others think about.

Yea we’re doomed either way. going start rolling things ready, theres much money line.  good news trial launch  positive results trial? hospitals overwhelmed? Charlotte sucks makes feel better. grew there. got paranoid today article said virginia reported 1600 deaths today. put overall total daily total been, think would sanity check kind stuff little better. It’s possible - would see new cases pop up, weeks new cases, virus spread asymptotically would expect see cases, since restrictions within nz likely someone would symptoms would gotten now(NZ still testing heavily), isn’t case (the new cases travel) insane number. happens common sense prevail.

Go back restrictions. difficult say wrong something prevent deaths? 

My state lifted bans I'm still self isolating. Depends market. Even small town rentals filled fast rents keep rising. Screw people downvoted really time talk recalling Abbott. Texans suffered enough. Yeah, saw that. thinking read story yesterday got ball rolling taking cancellation seriously.

I hope story changes minds gym. Arnold refuses go in, wake call since we’re morons we’ll flock celebrities doctors. Wearing good quality face-shield N95 mask - good practice, over-doing it? Would redundant, would actually add another layer protection? Common sense says it’s latter, it’s still good form ask around opinion. Funny, I'm Bay Area, always thought LA inexpensive. Parts nice, like Santa Monica suburbs, especially Ventura Orange County. Catalina beautiful. parks around LA nice.

The core city great world-class city supposedly rivals places like Paris Tokyo importance, opinion. like San Francisco New York, world-class cultural institutions. laugh tourists think Hollywood going glamorous magical.  growing prisons poorer areas lots minium wage workers live together. currently outbreaks. considered outbreak must 2 people test positive within 14 day window. 

Here’s list current/past outbreaks. CHDPE site shows 7 King Sooper outbreaks. Pretty sure University Sweden real ceremonies all, probably best. say, probably bad idea especially people arriving different places hope everyone feels way. Even one wearing mask still high chance getting rest fam it. Sorry bro sucks around (hijacking top comment)

I'm guy running (not OP here).

We showing countries reliable informative data available. maintain high standard make choice country display.

According John Hopkins CSSE data, Sweden fact *second* infected country **per capita**, count **the developed countries data readily available reliable.**

However, still according JH, **Sweden n°10 per capita** count second parameter. make take off.

Hey, gotta run bathroom. See 8 hours.  Hardly People care alright.

It's unusual bullied children punished, teachers, ""telling tales,"" make fun teachers front class, left injured, helpless utterly alone. 

It's wonder kids, no-one turn to, might snap. 

The world cruel some.  accelerating noone talking making orders them. 3,600 Texas yesterday. first bar, one agreed to, ""flatten curve prevent hospitals overwhelmed"". accomplished that.

""Flattening curve"" one done. need keep effort reach end. world taking Uncle Ben rice box, world Henry Ford still hospital named him?  Ok, even rally equally bad protests, that's argument favor rally.

In fact, rally almost certainly worse regards covid spread protests, given rally indoors mask adherence low (Note many protestors wearing masks) Can't open link know meant ""nursing home resident."" means skilled nursing, median time entrance skilled nursing facility death 5 months. means ""retirement homes"" generally, statistic way shocking. beautiful sight see! /s week half ago surge florida hit something like 2.3% positive rate. almost 10% now. California isnt going 400 600 cases day 3000 like florida reported today 3.8 million square miles US. Somebody owning home plot land preventing anyone owning home. Maybe could try giving away people diseases actually helps. outdoors, people wearing masks actually quarantining time incase covid positive. Think cult members same? Definitely. even 11% better 12. 120K ""Do wanna know got scars?"" Worth taking antibody test now? know extremely unreliable, anything changed? What’s reasonable price pay? suprising, virus survive long times cold chain. FB reverted way back ""it's flu.""

On bright side, really enlightening see many people graduated high school lawyers nurses cops also total morons.

At point making think democracy mistake. still speak lockdowns like people would easily decide shut down. Like FORCED it.

Nobody forced lockdown. done entirely choice. Every country paying price decisions took. mortality rates tell small part picture. 

However, find interest.  okay, thank 1904 plague, antibiotics weren’t popularized penicillin late 20s. plague didn’t end it.

Yes plague still exists, you’re missing point. 1st plague, second plague, ended, herd immunity. end everywhere, no, spread another area, weren’t interconnected today.

The plague would ravage area, disappear generations returning fresh victims.

No, plague represents happens herd immunity isn’t achieved everywhere, vaccine naturally, shit, kind already seeing work US.

Areas took covid chin March/April aren’t getting heavy new cases, areas got pretty clear, they’re getting them, even compliance social distancing policy consistent.

It’s cyclical thing. Like plague, London would get bad, lots death, ran people kill, cases, would travel another area ravage there, generations line survivors last plague elderly, plague would return kill survivors children grand children. Psychosomatic terribly irresponsible label dismiss patient's problems. 

I laughed promptly shown door asked doctor might CFS, getting harder harder stay active 5 minutes could longer work. year late finally collapsed, luckily quickly taken hospital checked B12 deficiency. almost died pernicious anaemia, relatively common problem every doctor know about. 21 - late 50s Honestly isn’t best outcome (State mandated mask wearing would been), huge win state Arizona. Ducey, still completely incompetent, gave power decisive leaders local governments. smart move part, shift fallout local leaders, still maintaining neutrality. It’s good play him.

Fingers crossed local leaders willing make unpopular decision mandate masks. know lot Arizona citizens furious, point even Governor acknowledges need. even wore mask!

At point, won’t see results next month. would bet least two weeks major cities implement, another two three difference seen. seriously. good news. Exactly. matter places reopened would deemed ""too soon.""

Lockdowns viable long term solution. beginning seeing happens open long. Door #1 = good. Door #2 = good.

Anyone see door #3 get 2020? article little old.. look actual texas graphic, has.
""1,900 excess deaths
March 15 – May 16"" old old people live with? apply rental homes? multi unit buildings? I’m expert coronavirus, definitely noticeable motifs happens. HIV example writes genome cells infects really weird life cycle contributes hard get rid of, takes long kill people, on.

Corona virus (what we’re dealing now) related common cold virus doesn’t display behaviors (that know of). understand it, people pass around, somewhere along way mutates people get new version. 

That said we’re constantly learning new things expect virus advance knowledge quite bit added scrutiny receiving. interesting comes light much thought always knew might change. signed lease february shit happened illinois. 3 units 6 unit apartment empty, 2 units emptied march april. Would love get since they're bigger current one price. Would great roommate i. protests. Typos *her doctor* 

Thank you. here, parents babysit nephew (toddler) last week. I’m furious, knew wasn’t well still asked parents late 70’s (my dad Parkinson’s health issues) watch him. haven’t “seen” parents almost 3 months REASON! I’m complete mess disregard parents health safety. love wanton soup. Lack ability defer gratification; writ large. two houses pool 900 month. Southeast cheap, although it’s doubled price since last recession. last executive order prohibited cities counties enacting measures. could cry work shutting give time testing tracing put place, public health officials failed hold part.

So economic pain nothing.

They threw away. dying ramp up. understand saying, that's exactly point. Unless one literally lives rock, understand whatever covid is, infectious, potentially lethal disease. Even trust media government, coronvirus numbers lie. point, choosing wear mask simply due ignorance, lack consideration around you, downright stupidity. gathering populated areas, refusing wear masks, ignoring shelter-in-place policies, would putting yourself, also everyone around you, greater risk getting disease. That's absolutely disgusting, anyone chooses shithole human being. Navy? mom's? [Excess deaths aren’t exceptionally high compared Turn people trees! drunk driving. illegal actually hurt someone? No, make illegal regardless specific injury activity practiced generally, results irreparable harm victim. 

Right now, simply existing public space without mask pose similar risk irreparable harm. wont build temporary hospitals things like that. heard exact thing NY planning always alternative.  Funny, wife, local walmart cashier. that's CNTRL+F for. quickly search keywords. Yes CFR 0.26 entire state going wiped out! Today California 3,600 (6% positive) cases vs. Wisconsin 260 (2.3% positive). Wisconsin much better. city Phoenix wanting mask mandate. Hopefully happens Trump’s visit next week, vigorously enforce it. referring michigan protestors. social activists mentioned article blm people criticizing specifically white people(like blm always do) felt protesting 'for gram', social justice. point view. felt give enough put enough blm. monthly mortgage went cost living increase freeze; don’t exactly want renting but... like masks. Arizona last week. routinely one wearing mask anywhere went. Including airport it’s “mandatory” Trumbkopf Metcalfe. Hes right, wouldnt still case month later? Unless military forced quarantines dont think ever going eradicate US. rights. Overtime got cut zero. Probably won’t much rest year. I’ll probably end money expected simply two canceled trips Florida nixing Comic Conventions normally go foreseeable future. I’m proposing anything. market forces lead things, unless small cities start passing ordinances say can’t buy home work remotely — small city would homeowners stand get wealthier phenomenon wealthier residents mean tax revenue. Enjoy living virtual SF suburb. Yeah, I've never left.. tried, issued orders overriding forbidding mandates.

Officials Tuscon, however, desperate recently looking loopholes around Ducey's ban mask requirements, much county officials Texas [are Thanks 🏅 take I'm poor even happen NY? aware CFR? Absolutely! I'm right that. We'll get this, wish necessarily kicking screaming! Thats regulatory problem much supply issue 

Having penalty taxes vacant homes step Shhh Please stay away Florida. many state license plates past week. Quit vacationing, middle pandemic! Best assume people try assholes make effort keep benefiting either taxpayer's expense personal expense. Teachers Texas organizations unionized. Going strike impossible... especially large portion population thinks liberal hysteria. 10% south regional level. people believed said masks didn’t work ones racist actually believed Chinese people wore reason. Yeah, /u/the_donnie makes seem like simple stop virus entering LTC facilities. NJ government acted information required LTC facilities NJ implement measures starting Mid-March. Unfortunately measures implemented COVID started spreading one knew much virus spreading time.

People seem forget LTC facilities close quarters living situations usually 2 residents room. Additionally, infected residents moved closed off/quarantined section tested regularly symptons.

It's easy say 'we taken appropriate measures!!!"" people knew time virus reacting. family members worked LTC facilities many years (i even) easy flipping switch. would argue US nursing homes fall Federal regulations five star Federal rating system, making effectively part national system. 

As alternatives, we've pushing greenhouses. Essentially, create Covid19-only facility that's supported multiple nursing home groups networks. way mixing Covid19 patients frailest vulnerable country. know guy owns multiple hospitals LA area great results. Alternatively, setup multiple new hospitals send there. example, NY spent setting multiple new hospitals receive single patient. 

The reality multiple solutions know fact presented Cuomo dismissed. Overall, he's done great job response, predictable failure. nothing, new issue - try thing SNFs flu patients every year similar bad outcomes. Children special education can't lose year school. longest break many year 2 weeks total. Regression real thing year regression devastating  casinos reservations subject state lockdowns? know casinos state shut down, know that's choose be. Homeowner here. 27. seem rather detached reality. like rent prices? Move. Make money. Many options. Quit blaming world problems. people sub still hoping spring breaker outbreak. long enough case take exactly two weeks incubate spreads? Masks works. Look asian countries wearing masks normal thing even covid. Look NYC huge majority wore masks, even phase 1. Yeah already open 2 months everyone except Beijing normal life. good enough? Even Beijing, 99% population go work hang out. need keep end year vaccine available. Lol thought someone fucked headline... rather hoped someone fucked headline asking American common sense considerate toward others??? Roflmao always thought California big sucess story, disappointed hear happening. they're not, know sub hates facts confirm apocalypse narrative nowhere near enough virus particles surfaces get anyone sick, possible via person person know reason Covid numbers high number flu-related deaths pushed ""probably Covid"" side? Probably one types:

""Self-centered narcissists, simply refuse make smallest sacrifice health well-being others, they’ve weaned individualism little appreciation interdependent community—that anything less completely unfettered freedom feels restrictive."" like $0.60 (7.25/12), point stands. idea ""well, know going effective, I'm even going try... *I'm* afraid, *I'll* fine"" offensively stupid me. death rate confirmed cases US 5%. That's 1 20. even going *try* avoid spreading that, ""tough""? Come on.  pay fine anyways story, Mark Finally someone twxas fucking sense. people don’t understand areas implement measures completely different results. saw 1918 flu pandemic well. don’t control virus think do. many factors, known unknown. think gave wrong numbers kind specific, I'll actually admit unlike people denial, like set record straight.

You said, OC gets ""fewer 100 cases day."" said 200 day. [Here's OC showing got 205 yesterday average trend 214. even showed right wrong imgur/WoM post. 

You said, LA 2/3 state's cases. said less half. again, link POSTED shows right wrong. 

Also wrong comparison non-LA counties rest country.

Do live post-factual world? secretly decided lie everyone people like could PPE.

Yeah? That's American way, baby. NY state union wants go back schools concerned dont ton jobs get removed. union actually might help regard. got know test 'em 
 Know open 
 Know consider 
 Know close 
 never count money

When sittin' table 
 There'll time enough countin' 
 dealin's done Kinda depressed, going local Target near closing hours people wearing mask besides workers. feel like shit awhile, totally sucks. Maybe took literally, cant think company randomly says “thank you”. They’re providing income, you’re favor.

If worked free could see it. unpaid intern maybe. 3,600 cases Texas yesterday. winning. United States modern Middle Ages. Rampant disease check, anti science check, religion rules check, lots violence check. avoid stores, people work can't. tests apparently done blood samples given early/mid-May, would represent people already infected start month.

They equate 925,000 total infections across Dutch population start May, substantial increase number infected start April. would also mean Dutch testing caught less 1/20 cases. Dutch friend told government pretty lax early on, true, ratio infections positive cases seems plausible.

Based number deaths recorded time study done, IFR Netherlands seems 0.6% (maybe little higher, depending record cases).

Blood donors perfectly representative sample general population, results seem roughly line what's found randomised antibody studies.  Protests massive places like Boston, New York, Philly, etc. 3 weeks zero uptick cases protests. fact cases declining rapidly. Probably North East actually took seriously beginning proper quarantine 3 months. Schools essential though large portion alternative education. leaving kids completely behind dont money involved parents completely throwing children special needs aside well. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* Bay Area I’d say 80% people wearing masks whenever go out. scares I'm moving Midwest Houston next month. wishing death upon someone (say post yesterday locked reason... much death wishing thing let’s say, don’t ask jury)  People yelling chanting going break masks efficiency. Masks cure-all’s. Especially get moist. 


If condemn rally COVID must condemn protest COVID. must know people Florida. don’t evacuate. I'm living rest life mask distance. Nobody else either. Maybe, ***maybe*** month two pandemic. Maybe. Shit forgot incident should’ve realized prick wouldn’t open even dying. doesn’t want prohibit people access government services don’t wear mask.

That's pretty decent way spin politically, pretty much everyone knows he's lying. sadly, folks fine that.  Hold beer - virus met. So, country best strategy Europe then? policy applied powerful ECDC? 2020.....were experts wrong Aztec calendar end date? Shit! thinking greater 200 thousand August, probally even closer 300 thousand. live Illinois see we're orange. case rate plummeting we've one intense lockdowns country that's started ease past couple weeks (and lot things still shut neighboring states). frequent stores, restaurants, shops.

No one crowds now. thing gone away. made point. Back following protocol. one staying home 3 months. um idiot say “edit: hoax” spelled right? think false hope finally slowly pivoting herd immunity strategy Test, Trace, Isolate?

No... suspect realise (with antibody tests) expectation unwarranted. believe that's expanded testing criteria.

However, different reason 'staying course' - I'm sure behind closed doors words ""it's late"" bandied about. would wrong. lock now, example, would still great affect could done much sooner.

So basically, think lie low simply hope numbers get high can't avoid taking blame. quietly start TTI try play plan along - simply say ""capacity"" ""successfully"" expanded capacity effective now.

They always war Eastasia... Thx - get 24K comment KARMA? Must something right:) could say told lie knowing experts support mass gatherings others, would rather civil assume mistake rather lie. 

“This letter signed 1,288 public health professionals, infectious diseases professionals, community Can’t wait extra-hypocritical protests :^) Yikes. don’t think we’ve seen numbers like since peak Italy / NY. :( stupid thing do. destroyed everyone’s trust “health authorities” deliberately lying them.

They secretly decided lie everyone America people like - healthcare workers - could PPE. resulted thousands extra dead bodies.

There never PPE shortage - look fancy masks gear cops own. growing (I'm 40 now), dad told class ever taught evolution happened, get walk classroom. I'd get swats ever made B, case could get F consequences.

Now, 30 years later he's convinced Covid created Bill Gates Chinese sell vaccinations / implants something, ignore point. Apparently else explain Bill Gates warned flu like virus 5 years ago...

Yeah spend 5 minutes /r/JoeRogan see everyone talking shit Joe. gets good guests, listen lot, man really revealed true colors lately. He's perfect example someone knows little lot. Unfortunately, dismisses idea influences millions people saying ""I'm comic talking shit podcast."" think important understand impact platform, whether intention. realize you’re replying comment made 26 days ago? Oh, look out! Got badass here. Wearing mask might make people feel little bit better. providing perfect protection people think Way go folks! Keep relaxing security prevention measures. “Early Data” .. probably day first day protests ... read Albert Camus's Plague right started worried. knew dramatic measures taken small town france would never go horribly way many US view freedom paired rampant antiintellectualism mistrust science overall.

(yes bubonic plague bit different yet still id worried wed respons even that) It’s kinda like wildfire approaching. “We’re shutting ever again!” [cheers applause] wildfire starts torching town people like, it’s little hot go shopping.

This thing literal force nature people still act like lockdowns choice. It’s like watching Chernobyl HBO, refuse accept reality situation.

The fire coming. People judging reopening based right now, fire distance. fire hits people live, it’s unrealistic think keep things open. 

Why? doctors nurses, even current plateau dying, say, “sorry, we’re f’ing lambs heading slaughter.” Joel Osteen won’t open church help public reason. look behavior Hurricane Harvey. good words say snake oil salesman. don’t answer everyone needs remember Osteen practice preaches. 

For wondering, Osteen open mega-church Houstonians desperate need shelter Hurricane Harvey furniture store opened doors everyone needed shelter. lost home belongings flooding. I’m bitter. Fuck Osteen. made right decision lock general population cause Mental crisis

Edit: http://covidactnow.org/ human flaw even worse 2-week lag time. reptile brain realizes shit truly gone down, late prevention.

When think it, ~14k ""walking dead"" people US infected already die matter point. Preventative measures late them. Thanks catching that. Point still stands. national protocol. states probably fine others seems silly. asymptomatic cases account large amount spread

I believe current understanding **presymptomatic** cases account majority spread. put fly list? Lots banks give shit. They'll gladly reclaim house. lucky, they'll defer.

And forget expenses suspended. Many states mandated utilities can't shut off, much like evictions, they'll shut everything soon get chance. Insurance? think insurance company cover skip payments, delusional. property taxes? Lmao city always get money.

The practice suspending evictions without giving landlords sort safety nets payment forgiveness borderline criminal. big-time landlord, huge deal 10% tenants pay rent. 90% cover it. small landlord 3 tenants, 2 stop paying, that's fast-track bankruptcy.  Well, I'm old enough remember Mike Pence said ""we're together"" - endorsed economic bailout plan gave taxpayers $1200 money, corporations TRILLIONS. wear seat belt, wear mask! point beginning end. live small city large university, I’d noticed great majority Asian looking people saw wearing masks public early February onwards.   Didn’t see anyone young Asians wearing face masks back January. seems like we’ve got similar mask wearing 30-50% general population locally. means nothing know still infectious. Hopefully started lab culture. PCR can't tell virus alive dead plenty things irritate immune system sensitive. need know picked live virus dead remnants now. think college experience, think campus, practical application information, interacting people.

I worked 2 years going college paid way myself, student debt. Thing is, biggest thing took away education practical experiences interaction people courses.

Also, went school internet really ""thing"" besides bit email like - find much information online.

I can't see university age kids wanting what's basically home schooling extravagant amounts money, especially they're paying it. would feel like waste time effort. presumably regardless local laws, someone preexisting conditions concerns would lock down. that's meant Yeah, I'm still mad bunch idiots whined spineless government caved. would point rest dumb Fox run around unmask spreading disease everywhere love hiking Colorado. ¿Porque los dos? using ""special"" short-schoolbus meaning word, you?

""Were together"" lasted one month got bored you-know-who declared going away ""air tight."" Even though Texas huge, mind boggling imagine 3k people walking/being admitted hospital one day. long line. many stretchers. Cuomo said briefings, reopen...but watch infection rate.

He’s never going favorite Swedish PM ever fair said “this time year” might true. don’t know sources though since they’re published.

Take Commander Fravor episode example. important interview gotten anywhere else. Stop acting like child. Please feel free back claim anyone thinks going get worse gets better psychopath. I'll wait. Yeah, people idiotic. dont get it. I'm sorry put risk fools. Decent lockdowns hurt economy, help countries get rid Covid much possible, *then* reopen rebuild economy
 
Half-assed lockdowns hurt economy, help countries get rid Covid, patience runs out, reopen rebuild economy, Covid cases rise sharply, wash rinse repeat economy *really* crashes. time.

Again, idea they're talking about. harms person. person would wear mask , would infect countless others. safety dependent you. health community dependent compliant mask wearing.

If made feel better, could wide spread education use masks.

The majority people know multiple masks, includes unemployed friend sewed himself. people know careful rewear. careless people get infected matter what. rest take precautions like least putting sun.

Resorting insults can't back point pathetic. drop dead... see low, low prices! aren’t alone. It’s unsettling months, sociological standpoint. often question whether I’m overreacting can’t tell COVID information I’m consuming comes relatively small network sources (curated Twitter list public health experts top universities across country). see logical, vettable information posted *credible source #348* that’s corroborated experts Twitter replies, I’m reminded isn’t overreaction. every week mind rinses repeats :) wish knew answer. It’s probably combination denial lack availability testing. family showing symptoms late March, screening testing really strict didn’t qualify. it’s much widely available, people acting like it’s over, hardly anyone wears masks, etc. county population like 250k, seem low. article confirm that.

But keep took seems change among handful states. several places, state officials seem classifying many likely COVID deaths pneumonia deaths well. Oh yeah, originally comment ""Disclaimer: apply US"" end must deleted accidentally. think US, problem isnt even people obey rules (lack of) leadership actively encourages people act ways makes situation worse. would thought intentionally infecting nursing homes would good idea?

Outdoor transmission pretty low, keep social distance walking around. get wanting everyone wear masks indoor stores events. outdoor mask mandates seem insane me. quit smoking nothing? “wE aInt clOsing” Hahaha know that's true not, guess probably still damn funny.

Yeah fuck let millions die instead right?

FFS wrong you? Look numbers per capita. surge California small compared Florida mean tested posted May 2. way recent us think made full recovery immediately caught again. Yeah insane many people can't get passed idea everything happens them. great parents told us special growing clearly mentioned everyone special =\ headline could provide fodder haters Yeah outdoors seems safer expected, especially masks worn. MN 2,500 active cases right now. (31,296 positive tests, 27,404 recovered, 1,357 fatalities). We're acting like over. go out, wear cloth mask Australian outback hat. (The hat personal style points. can't look stupider, might well put fucking outback hat on, lol) telling you, I'm there. I've heard suburbs different. Half people suburbs paying attention social distancing masks. live, walk alone. occasionally see someone mask chin. know, like taught us 🙄. saw mom kid walking towards bus stop yesterday double-take. masks on. first time week I've seen fucking mask used. unbelievable here. Mind you... working. definitely virus control. Im thinking, personally, I'm way past point life going embarrassed wear mask risk destroying lungs. Im going wearing mask long while. find amusing, surprising, first comment response post ""removed moderator"" incivility. Even mandates it, people know can't enforced ignore it. hope mandates masks businesses go back requiring entry. Houston HEBs required masks like two days. Maybe that's there's many people refusing wear masks... /s  Fuck yeh Texas. Let’s show world brave are. /s apartment listings bizarre, reason houses continue move quickly interest rates low. 236 positive 365 tested that’s wild Oy. Sorry brother. hurts read. mean anything. opt state government supported. still care. didnt last time locked first people took seriously week two slowed numbers. That's problem lockdowns. work seems like nothing I'll one step crazy optimism. think available earlier December even. Every country everywhere going pushing thing get released ASAP. I'm you, think safe least partially/mostly effective.  Virus’s tens become virulent less deadly overtime. guess means gets tired eventually lol That's awesome man, almost thing.

I know mean much help knowing young people understand concept social responsibility. come upstate rural NY confirm backward-ness. 🤣honestly might worse. Lol. 3200 cases today. Looking pretty hot! still chimed in. hiding closet? dashboard says 2.7k reported today 6/17. number come from? Wentzville, Missouri, estimate 25% wearing masks. Big meh Gary...... difficult concept rest USA?!

Because leaders news sources telling real going fade away. Universities Tennessee postponing campus graduation ceremonies August, coincides bringing students back onto campus well. bad idea. forget woman set states official dashboard fired fucking numbers make look better made new private dashboard public sources state one used use.

The state's official tally today 81K cases. site shows almost 91K instead. 

Her site is: anyone curious. fuck landlords think going move in?  He's right. dumb. 
Old Navy packs 5 masks $12! They're pretty comfortable double layered. come nice colors. felt pretty safe going store long long. Nowhere. stay home orders primary goal flatten curve healthcare facilities stayed capacity, hospitals max capacity, deaths serious cases increase dramatically. hospitals full, accept severe cases. happens, treatable cases become much serious lack medical resources.  domino effect we've seen time time multiple countries. easy transport patients need hospitalization around different counties states, went extreme measures past couple months. Hope treatments PPE situations improved since start this, looking really bad multiple parts country. i'm afraid tourist attractions harder time deciding close cases town people people make bulk economy. disney area florida, gatlinburg TN, etc already seeing God, Guns Freedom.... Alrighty then. useful comparison situations. Texas alone nearly 3x population Sweden, comparing raw numbers entire USA would pointless. ""Some going die, DJI care COVID."" cops (especially NYPD) *never* wear masks...

No protesting flu season!

Statistically you’re probably likely die heat stroke.

No protesting summer! Maybe kinda thing w/ fetuses detection syndrome might want look into. tragedy know Taiwan South Korea fight virus things opened up. Wear fucking mask competent teams test trace. Nope. want dead bodies pile up. know lot people responsible actually getting tested since easily accessible free participated protests. long ICU numbers don’t go up, it’s bad headlines implies. glad live DC. trajectory fantastic gone pokemon Amazon tribe stereotype Almost every former Soviet central Asian country run dictator. Turkmenistan horse fucker president Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedov That's correct. 

If virus becomes deadly becomes less infectious. Sars instance killing host could spread. 

If virus becomes less deadly becomes infectious time spread. Italy saying viral load last weeks less seeing start. Maybe moved younger people. Sadly one knows Thanks Sweden experimenting rest us. Wish to. Stay safe please. Maybe they're aware masks necessary indoors? Insert everything’s fine meme Like Easter 😂? get pissed see people grocery stores picking items putting back shelf. blows mind many people lack awareness common sense.  true 

We’re 83 percent 

With surge capacity counted elective surgeries continue took rick scott granted 20% unlucky enough make hospital. Yes, exactly said. Glad agree think person posted /r/advice yesterday. so, would make 15

They forced go beaches also universal studios could easily NYC Jersey 1.5 months. hot summer everthing phase 3, people seeing low numbers getting relaxed again. virus even touched population yet. even 1% total population confirmed. think May 30th, looking LA Times. Exactly. protests systematic equality judicial system. too! friends! sure downvoted. one first circles begin shelter place still part. necessary outings, always wear mask, etc.

But repeatedly keep hearing ""Because X, there's going major resurgence 1-2 weeks!"" ""You wait! gonna awful!"" ""X"" equaled...

* Protests reopen 'murica
* Opening beaches golf courses
* Opening bowling alleys, nail salons businesses
* BLM protests
* Opening beaches

It seems there's weekly 'wacky collection crowds' that's sure 'trigger resurgence', keeps really happening much.

I \*think\* I'm assessing information making reasonable decisions, see lot people buying whole ""it's big deal"" mindset seems much crying wolf. Yep, definitely taking discretionary flights anymore pandemic over. thinking going vacation point f*** airlines giving respect human life health; hell I'll giving extra cent profit. disagree. wanted make note simply higher ups controlling this. population needs lack discipline able follow orders. Definitely two way street. state fairly well also hope numbers continue show trend time. I'd like get normal life back point.... college football feel that's already gone year. Has?! anybody would go America right beyond me... problem buck doesn’t stop landlords cases.  carrying mortgages rental properties banks *always* get money. might right, somewhat surprisingly people know careful older Trump voters know. one hand, makes sense want live! ones know give shit think nobody tell younger. Obviously ones know evidence others acting way. 


I revised mask-wearing estimate downward--way downward-- 40% trip town yesterday. 10% best trip.  based people saw coming stores. people saw waiting buses--and presume affluent people, bus system SUCKS--NOT ONE wearing mask. increase seen since beginning June nothing though, rather (finally!) big increase testing among groups people seriously ill. Due logical cases spike - mean R-value 1.

The number people ICU confirmed deaths keep decreasing though, telling statistics stage spread increased testing. Well, imagine consider good portion population somehow convinced masks unconstitutional, tantrum something sensible like passed. absolutely fucking ridiculous became political lot people. want help people die. 85,926 confirmed cases coronavirus Florida. number reported deaths increased 3,061, increase 43 since Wednesday. get iPod, get iPod mini. Every know girl! not? Kremlin paying degree shitposting/disinformation upvoted reddit?

It's good deal, think it! article say April Palm Beach hospitals combined 50% 23% beds left(77%). looks increase 27% matter 2 months Yep. know fucked big time governor pissed sides *during goddamned pandemic* Dont bother idiot, wasting time.

I say though, smart beach. least locals know this. Locals don’t congregate known packed areas. successfully beach areas wouldn’t another human around least 20 feet. people packing highly likely vacationers. Ok chill out, deathrate 3% sure hell 15%.

It admittedly hard get accurate death rate since highly dependant age group. Old people far higher, kids almost 0. itd 3% general population.

Its serious, cold. also deadly claim. No. Unfortunately there's lot companies dgaf employees kinda forced go back work Kentucky's faulty unemployment still paid since laid early April. 80% people asymptomatic. Correlation? be. Takes time new cases filter infection reporting process. Also, know everyone keeps bringing sort ""gotcha"". know anyone thought protests *wouldn't* risk. Nope, blaming you. putting anyone reads thread, can’t filter actions experience everything fundamentally different. idea. epic center brah! seen good bad. Good maybe less severe think. Bad spread without knowing. think mainly like made way younger people rather care homes elderly. death rate people age 45 UK less 1%. Pretty much like every where. Italy ago posted deaths age. 16 people died age 45 know figure tho. weeks ago competent president times believes science looks greater good society, would've saved lot lives. Certainly must know ""ilk"" showing exact patterns? seriously unaware recognize obsessing shit-talking country never to, point posting several articles subreddit time every single day, making conspiracy theories, *probably* making friends country, anything close healthy ""organic"".

You'd surveillance anywhere else.

Take break, look mirror. I'm Aliso Viejo went Starbucks last weekend buy coffee, 8 customers there, 1 wearing mask.

Besides though, part, people around still wearing masks. heavy trace though? Lockdowns always going hurt working people small businesses more. That's one many reasons terrible ideas. Conclusion: 
Daily smokers rate patients symptomatic COVID-19 lower compared general population can't fucking comprehend actions DeSantis, Abbot, Kemp, etc. 

Either you: Impose partial lockdown now, get things back control within weeks, reopen again.

Or: Continue embark wild path reopening everything sight, either forced lockdown put 7 people ventilator, see economy go shitter consumer confidence collapses. failed save public health failed save economy.

It's like ""do want one candy five candies later"" thing kids. human lives. links better source another language. people think us advocating caution getting info reddit posts, wont convinced. we're still ""bottom 2nd inning."" Better warm bullpen.... Fuck yeh Florida Florida Man need most? Yeah sorry want let government know I'm meeting.

Sure might trust government protect data properly someone somewhere need protection privacy.

It's fine time guarantee stop it. right mind would spit someone wearing mask??? I’m utterly baffled behavior! state grade differently... depends loyal sword Trump’s guidance. History judge well. people behind propaganda machines behind state government?

But yeah, get point. Ducey. plenty blame go around likely happen AZ next two months. One hope vaccine rushed. People wary rushed science rightfully so. would even know cases going time? Contract tracers cant keep up, even bother trying measure it?  one forces read posts. So, *you* 'give rest'? Florida provide percentage positive tests private labs, report statewide hospitalization rates. Everyone see Brooklyn wearing masks store owners strict social distancing. least city, people still conscious, quite proud us quickly changing behavior around. bad. people going clubs, gyms, bars, stores masks, ignoring social distancing carrying like business usual. going bad, going worse way NYC least centralized authority taking swift action. lot squabbling municipal authorities one responsibility. '

This 9 yikes meter. Weird Florida got lot crap criticizing new yorker’s fleeing Florida early on. one win here. majority protect shame grandmother 93.. what? Yeah... considerably lower death rate... cut LA county, we'd still populous state union 60% current positive cases. It’s Olympics, rush records... ""Root for?"" who's making sort competition? Sweden's neighbors want keep borders closed it. bad even enough stop infection exported last long... Yeah man, I'm baffled are. friends taking necessary measures wear masks social distance, we've seen people lining get bars restaurants southern California, wearing masks standing shoulder shoulder. crazy seems like everyone's done virus want move on. virus done us.

Hopefully one day come back visit. also wanna visit Canada one day. Stay safe friend. It’s pretty universally accepted people forced wear clothes lol, govt can’t mandate clothes though public private property. difference then? Takeout definitely open Denmark, hardware stores many types businesses labeled ""essential"" US, restaurants closed. know Germany opened early, video conferencing German colleagues already back work mid-April one masks. eschew masks Scandinavia well. know Spain Italy implemented strict curfews needed papers go things, police enforced. US mostly measures Canada yet death per capita rate almost high Sweden Canada far behind us. Answering question would explain lot...what different?? Ok sure, say “muh freedom” sound like fool.

If going make point, don’t sound like idiot whose trying make concern personal freedoms sound like like backwards rednecks care about. Oh know nice people OC! 

But seems like they're minority lol nice headline Guardian op ed piece.

""Sweden - stupid evil?"" shit, sherlock. Citation: Yesterday Denmark tested 14.149

If point boils observing politicians politick, I'm sure thread. certainly rationalize anti-science viewpoints pervade certain segments American society. Yes did. check realise stupid comment was. 670,000 Spanish Flu... Dwight Schrute, ya?  dont believe masks? Lol, god people dumb. Gonna find wearing mask beach feels like

I expect hot lol Comparing war deaths disrespectful people gave lives country. “going away” looks like, can’t wait winter😳 120,000 deaths C-19. 

NCHS collects death certificate data state vital statistics offices deaths occurring United States. provisional counts coronavirus disease (COVID-19) deaths based mortality data National Vital Statistics System. 

This number death counted includes deaths pneumonia, influenza and/or COVID-19 listed cause death calculated. due COVID-19 may classified pneumonia deaths influenza deaths (deaths due “flu” “flu-like illness”) absence positive SARS-CoV-2 test results. company policy valves (vents). one-way valve allows air escape. Probably less well fitted mask someone showing noseage. SLO? I'd read coast alright suffering. knew us...

I get rush push vaccine all, like skipping steps.

People wear clothes public.

People 21 wear motorcycle helmet.

People use seat belts cars.

You wear mask keep getting it. wear mask keep spreading it. rule needs exist protect public *as collective* itself. course knew masks effective, want announce effective afraid would exacerbate panic buying PPE, main priority safety health care workers. Many ran PPE working without protection beginning outbreak. Ok. know heard people getting food, I'm still getting food can't wash. use Dr. Bronners soap wash everything that's produce cook it. not. Fuckin plague Unfortunately, *literally* die upon hill without one word: no. US world superpower, household. interventions literally investment would reap benefits short medium term way social safety net is, much bigger immediate scale (I'm talking literally paying companies maintain productive capacity recovery comes immediate instead drawn out)

The larger cost future generations would come effects two generations row come age massive crisis rug mostly pulled them, path currently taken. “But there’s short supply” guaranteed cause panic theft hospitals, though. 

The world shortage since January. re-supply going come China. barely make here. didn’t re-stock last pandemic. 

The messaging masks fucked start, America already 1) massively anti science 2) fuck you, got mine. 

We would needed Trump Fauci together tell people wear homemade masks, demonstrate wear together consistently. encourage everyone make like victory gardens WWII. 

We would also needed Trump invoke DPA January control mask supply medical workers trades. forgot walking dog, multiple times day perhaps? Putting man moon independent project.. shutting world year? even WW1/WW2 dramatic impacts.

Unlike China, companies west actually freedom move please. 

What’s China going do? west move shit shut plants, try stopping them, see happens head start. America getting safer protect COVID-19 border wall Mexico extreme overprotected virus. would said take genius figure out, saw actual pandemic turned out.... That's payment I'm saving towards bay :l im LA too. dont see rents going down? properly trained going back previous jobs? California found January Arizona new Florida? Cases dropping Maryland: testing dropped positivity rate declining, good. too. I'm somehow embarrassed anti-choice (pro-life) religious people saying ""people gonna die anyway - move on!""... there's logic discuss there.  


""WWJD? OPEN UP, LET 'EM DIE!"" say choice meaning what? state decides strategy? like saying water wet.

In context meaning ""by choice"" alternatives. ones? Go brazil? Immunity no, less severe reactions sure. already know blood type studies. though . 60 like .1 chance dieing... Stop fear mongering piece shit. They’re NZ citizens, NZ currently closed non citizens. Please don’t comment thing know about.

It bad got worried air seeping car. 😂 point, likely going accept it. vaccine comes 60% whatever population vaccinated, businesses aren’t going patient people sure want vaccine.

When world truly fully reopen, go risk getting world won’t wait Yea, China allow pack leave, like Everything feels expensive pre-rona lol think still 1-2 weeks see anything protests. really entirely true. prices Manhattan insane, definitely find one bedroom studio apartments $1500 boroughs. frequently see really decent one bedroom apartments $1400~ areas Brooklyn like Bay Ridge parts Queens. terrible don’t mind commute. people would disagree good thing bunch cities bunch mad people letting know exactly cut lol know people love respond 70k dead year flu but... Covid deadly mostly transmission rates. Yet reddit sub people assuming family die Covid....when reality almost not. risk factors doses differ. scientific evidence natural immunity Sars2. back, properly trained? sure hell don’t act like Oklahoma. he's consistently backed military countries overseas... dicks. lease said required 60 days notice leave. law says give renewals 30 days. gave renewal 35 days since 60 days deadline charged $3600 enough notice. house owned older couple. get full house access. 1. far we've got minks (there mink farms people caught animals human-animal-human transmission) bats. People lot interaction bats think, come people consuming them. also seem evidence cats dogs able contract - whether they're able transmit back humans question still, certainly possible. can't mandate interaction species.

2. remember years ago everyone terrified ebola? measles, then? even vaccine that, certainly affects rich countries. 

3. point exactly that, though - know effective be. cohort mainly kills (the elderly) group produce good antibody responses vaccines anyway, I'm convinced death rate significantly lower. Somewhat lower? Sure. much huge question. Like said start, wonder *how much* benefit countries lock wait vaccine actually see. Cases gone bad worst. hell problem? can't identity affiliation here? really wish landlords like this. Ive rented 15 years renewal rents would raise 10% more. places Ive rented last five raise enough Id paying brand new tenents. move every year. Sucks reallllly hate moving. dont worry deposits credit good, usually scaled. One place needed $50. navy family though bad landlords Always kept deposits even though damage matter well cleaned. (I even hired professionals one time argued deposit, return check kept “getting lost mail” gave year). Shingles comes mind New York required people wear masks inside businesses while. kind se ond nature now.

Only areas open restaurants (it's region) operate 50% capacity 6 ft tables. Staff wear masks customers whenever they're moving around restaurant. Trump bought lots India? relate?

Fairly sure they're branding too. moved current apartment August. three rent increases time. even year. definitely property tax increases. ridiculous can't afford move spend lot time feeling pissed powerless. Damn, guess elect assholes fall then. PS poverty line per US government 2020, household 1, actually $30,000. It's, get this, $12,760 net per year.

Fucked much? problem friends compared midwest; also good ol pop punk/emo shows topic...I know, insanly irritating county called Surprise.

I stop thinking mayor always appears worst possible time yells: ""SURPRISE"" think problem arises exponential growth sets in. get ever increasing amount new admissions hospitals, time realize you’re run still ~2 weeks new cases could potentially need hospital bed. last two weeks also greater percentage active cases leading super fucked situation. depends surge capacity fill hospital hallways reclining chairs old broken beds. Convention centers beds like. shut yet kept them? Land maybe, materials much, long keep supersizing house. Housing prices increased many, many times rate material labor costs. whole Halloween plan gone shit, then. 70K year, 3 months doubled that, four trimesters year. math (MAGA hatters, don’t worry know gives headache).

No need add more. thinking Corona, big deal.

The fatality rate healthy 30 year old example signifcantly less 0.0001% hospitalisation rate almost low.

It literally factor concerned about.

On one hand 100% agree you.

On emotional reaction kind like poor person trying listen sympathetic rich friend complaining buy Porsche afford Aston Martin. Yep, responding old talking points again, deserve new comments every time. I'd lvoe see much wealth actually average person versus person already vastly wealthy . know anyone's modeling Florida specifically, nationally spread kept pretty firmly near middle mean guess entire exposure forecasts clickbait headlines report worst case scenario, might impression spreading slowly expected. reality spread stayed pretty well lower estimates models. difference things like Udemy web-based platforms free low-cost go-at-your-own-pace learning programs net degree.

That's coincidence. Trump's zombies paying attention science. strangest 1up competition. actually don’t. believe people able make choices. take issue lack intellectual consistency constant moving goalposts. that’s bit extreme  Ugh look them... 

They wreak Trump support. far off! Right basic idea, quite right application.

Total ticket revenues = number guests multiplied price tickets.

So keep total revenues same, ticket costs must multiplied factor guest count divided by. 

We get factor dividing original guest count (100 percent) new guest count (30 percent). gives us factor 3.33. 

Then multiply original ticket cost (100 percent) 3.33, give us new ticket cost 333 percent.

(Also, since multiplication division inverse operations, take shortcut dividing original ticket cost 0.3.) gets way ego stand podium front dumbest Americans poke fun smartest Americans. inferiority complex yet could turn around nice guy helps country....but nope. Ha! You’re plain wrong means Downtown oversupply issue COVID. find apartment complex pay move you. They’re NHL,NBA,MLB,Disney, NCAA, Olympics, countless stores businesses shutdown hoax. put others risk become unbelievable guy. nursing homes sending people hospitals didn’t need hospitalized  starting see results Memorial Day.

I’d hold judgement yet. Well, money isn’t going walk collection plates own. April months later infected early January. couldn’t find dates anywhere main hospital Wuhan. Yes sleep peacefully people virus care spreading not. I’ve looked data. Small mortality people 50. Average age died higher life expectancy age country. Lower rate transmission among “asymptotic presymptomatic persons”, half chance catch virus you’re 20. I’ve looked it. don’t shit pants whenever see new terrifying title fear mongering article doesn’t mean I’m using science. keep condescending. I’m sure viewpoint obscured high horse. Including doomers. I’ve thought fully online school like Connections Academy affordable option would agree it. work full time qualified teach Honors Chemistry, AP US History, classes she’s currently signed myself, price various tutors would required courses concern well. Honestly I’m hoping school decide go back online fall they’re waiting see happens Covid case numbers summer...

Maybe 11 it’s still “everyone class vaguely friend” biggest thing remote learning takes away friendship-by-proximity. High school students aren’t making new friends zoom period-calc lecture. I’m college, admittedly bit older elementary high school, went remote 3 weeks semester. normal semester would make friends (or least friendly with) kids classes, semester didn’t even know names. house fire dying down, recall fire department pour gasoline instead..

go hogs! Good luck ~ prayers all. Jesus. freelancer lost half income got squat! Would love get unemployment. Making like $800/month right hate bot here. Fine, can’t directly quote article I’ll post picture it. Literally confirms right first paragraph  says numbers state exceeding Brazil Peru, he's expecting state one hardest-hit regions world. state's numbers exceeding European countries well, Feigl-Ding “So terrible things heard Lombardi, Italy, Arizona per capita surpassed Lombardi, Italy. became worried yesterday,"" numbers due increased testing state, explained, saying, “The rise cases outstripping rise testing see positivity percentage.” mean guess would better people lived healthier this? counting though. People need systems guidance communal motivation otherwise always default highest convenience. case anyone’s wondering, curve flattened Illinois getting plasma may even someone covid? seems like big flaw... Yeah that’s definitely something believe! really frustrated saw it. Woo pig mean technically stays same, become less lethal susceptible already dead... COVID hitting us, give time. article linked OP actually says Texas elective surgeries, take hospital resources ICU beds.

I'm NYC, stopped elective surgeries fairly early. Hospitals started scheduling urgent elective procedures past couple weeks. can't imagine kind clusterfuck going Houston resource usage right now.

(Just note, ""elective surgery"" means something scheduled extent. Basically, something emergency organ transplant. lot elective surgeries desperately needed patients -- heart surgeries, cancer, etc. -- there's serious cost increased risk patients delayed.) That's true fact. toured NASA museum last year remember correctly said Huntsville highest number rocket scientists per capital US. Personally, think aside New Zealand, governments screwed Asia affordable, especially healthcare. never learn.   course doctor say that. Doctors tend involved health, whereas politicians involved ~~bribes~~ ~~kickbacks~~ economy. dependent live State/City area. can't afford California all, afford AZ, though barely. landlord raising rent $5-10 every years, year raised $15 &amp; told going inch $45 next couple years. one lowest rental priced apartments. Honestly, point I've come accept going deal 2nd 3rd wave government, communities, neighbors absolutely fucking failed us. disappointed humanity seems like always like COVID-19 catalyst remove mask rationality society wore. ashamed fellow Americans, fallen far hurts. tested positive COVID yesterday first red flags lost sense taste smell couple days ago little coughing cough 1-3 times per day. technically feel like fall asymptomatic (doubt it) category haven’t really felt anything loss taste smell. anyone know recovery time also 2 weeks mild cases vary? Partially dependent local ordinances too! moved GF apparently weren’t allowed raise rent. new contract signed say raise rent, I’m sure haven’t yet considering it’s gone $400/month definition wanton makes sense context, I'm confused Holy shit, balked 1k month. fuck would live area costs much live? could take month rent move across country Live months. Lmao argue one, that's true gets Oh don’t worry, society adapts, they’ll back.

And say “it’s nearly bad irl”, you’ve obviously never heard cancel culture / doxing. 

With amount private information people put publicly online, become astoundingly easy completely destroy someone’s life.

Enjoy relative peace lasts. bullies, racists sexists improvise, adapt overcome.

In meantime, make damn sure don’t private personal information floating social media / Reddit. 

Hell, even personal fitness tracking app could leaking live location location history publicly RIGHT NOW. Make sure privacy settings air tight. 

And can’t get privacy settings air right, seriously consider deleting accounts. become serious liability leaking personal private information publicly. Cya. Maybe one day you’ll read post lmfaoooooo!!!! 2008 said bottom housing market hit till 2011. RemindMe! October 1 locked houses actually abided rules testing/contact tracing done, could've opened safely like countries doing. Well, actually everyone it, *is* need test. That's different willful ignorance order deflate numbers election purposes. actually improving part, hospitalizations down. New cases seem downward trend. Around 2.5% positive rate tests. things note Milwaukee Madison kept stay home order done reopening stages. Mn Mi also reopened indoor dining/bars since start June IL likely July. virus seems spread mostly within social groups moreso public spaces. July may start seeing resurgence across Midwest people's willingness social distance capacity ends things ok. should, tenant agreed pay market rent, pay next year continue living house changed? Yeah outbreaks China none made here. Lesson? Don’t nice NZ. People idiots. allowed in, damn sure I’d park somewhere two weeks mess things up... I’m Canada hope keep US border closed there’s vaccine. didn’t well, least take seriously part. ? Trump sick enough deny importation US do? Things seem right weeks ago US whole. Reopening states continue matter situation. basically take risks now, I'm fine hospitals danger overflowing.  Haiti know medical infrastructure protests cause, would spike. isn't. America sucked getting control idiot Oval Office decided turn public health tribal issue legions idiots MUH FREEDOMS instead wearing fucking mask. 

If look cause spread, overwhelmingly bars restaurants. protests. I’ve seen Chanel. Agreed, “timing housing market” implies you’re sitting cash renting waiting market drop. you’re actively burning cash waiting making cost timing housing extra high; least timing stock market sit cash thing you’re losing inflation. ""Good News"" flair go away? check whenever I'm feeling down.. Positive tests prisons count? prisoners considered human anymore? Typo, that's fix Dropping metrics: positive percentage tested, hospitalizations, deaths. Wait...what!? girl worked Walmart rocking one... real Gucci? Point flight “1st Tier” tech cities SF Silicon Valley places like Austin, Denver etc simply made COL go destination city. 

The “housing crisis” WFH solves people WFH - makes far less affordable people already living destination cities (as Austin, Denver, etc). hope cake isn’t lie 😣 national guard upcoming violent riots looting, fooled.  least get live cool stuff made people move first place priced out.

Expound slander. combination things like rent control, limited real estate, percieved desireability live state. Depends Ohio. Cleveland, especially east side suburbs, rural parts Cincy, you’re fine. Columbus Dayton? much

And speaking people work Cleveland Columbus, cause concern, battleplans covid gets bad again, tons beds available spread across wide assortment hospitals.

Clearly unlike lot places, Ohio spent first lockdown whole point lockdown was, get hospital system ready cases. Well, depends eradicated others haven't. purely due biology due motivation/cost? Coronavirus obviously causing world lot problems right might one worth focusing eradication. fact multiple countries eradicated purely social distancing without vaccine suggests world could vaccine really wanted to. think spot here. actually one three owned place, designated initially place retire to, rented ""nice young people"" jobs took elsewhere. young &amp; upcoming engineers never late rent, even dotcom crash got us laid off.

Early pretty good, quickly became one ""We're trying help starting out"" turned ""mOnEy!!!!111!!!"". happened housing bubble forming anecdotally local owner went kinda nuts saw dollar signs.

There certainly lot learned Nolo press sources constantly defend. I'm lucky able find something reasonable &amp; quickly worked us turned real shitshow left. Bad tenants fighting one landowner others eventually decided worthwhile anymore. According one landowner sort kept contact side, new tenants showed *actually* bad tenants looked like. well, arizona know of. syndrome takes 6-12 weeks develop initial infection. Besides, way knowing many children/young adults infected, accurately gage rare may may be. mean, *are* people openly lied American public usefulness masks, made political issue. ""The thing wanted verify allowed write/think freely. based answers seems case.""

How world come conclusion? kind education system exists USA? even verify I'm China Chinese first?

This people laugh USA. Lol, pay $3100 800 sq ft. 1 bedroom/1 bathroom. apartment decided hike $540 $680. Literally told us right lease expire, time look places.

Needless say, fucking pissed Probably 2022 rate. Brazil probably one last countries recover crisis last Orioles fan here. alone Seattle. way bring criminal charges governors. inaction directly killing people. :) That's $300 thermometer right  2+2 = 4 NHL look Ottawa hub city. upset orange manchild charge? pandemic gone scale, evidenced fall number deaths. around [4 times lower peak April. enough doctors handle 4x stress, Earth could ever shortage? suggesting number deaths nationwide increase 4x soon? Finally!!!

Cities Florida Texas trying well. hope Governors step way too.

I'm tired reading everyday Arizona, Florida, Texas set new daily case records. fucking shit...she's hero American Patriot. Nothing selfless. attempted negotiate lease went additional $700 month. totally shocked increase (given 30 days notice). 30 unit building 10 vacancies counting due ridiculous increases got. world given herd immunity quit trying create vaccine? new plan every country forever control TTI? crossed realm incomprehensible statistics months ago. one outside immediate families mourns deaths. 

As long hospitals deal influx pretend everyone gets sick bed nurse look them, so-called leaders continue test stretch boundaries public acceptance Fewer people 0-14 range died year last year (over countries data set). Gila River tribe knows 👌 surprised even reopened first place Late discussion put thought: I'm optimistic continue see sustained drop pollution we've seen pandemic lock-downs - individuals want sacrifice ""right"" long-distance vacation. 

Despite cruise ships proving huge floating petri dishes onset current pandemic, cruise lines USA already reporting decent demand booking September travel. use dirty bunker fuels outside coastal waters, solid garbage generated, prop churn sensitive near shore environments, etc., behemoths also huge polluters. Even port, many cruise ships refuse plug cleaner shore power continue use ""clean diesel"" generate electricity, producing lot ground level air pollutants reduce air quality significantly port cities. pollution portioned berths ships, passengers carbon footprint 3 times someone ashore. 

But people need cruises. air travel. 

Despite spread via air travel one biggest reasons pandemic hit worldwide proportions fast, can't imagine see significant drop volume air traffic pre-COVID levels restrictions eased. clean-air benefits seen due lock-downs quickly reverse too.

Air routes multiplied exponentially past decades, mostly due pleasure travel. major cities, steady stream arriving departing jetliners single biggest producers ground level pollutants. Air travel uses much energy 6 passenger cars produces 3x pollution - per passenger - driving distance. effect jet exhaust altitude 4x greater pollutants ground level. 

We choose look pollution industry personal responsibility. carbon footprint vacation travel largely responsibility airline cruise industry, contributors?

As analogy: everyone world tossed pebble lake, time last stone tossed, we'd gravel pit instead lake. Instead acknowledging this, seem keep sifting gravel looking boulder causing water displaced lake...

We want big business big government come solutions pollution. switching cleaner energy sources industry electrical generation greatly help, carbon taxes buying ""offsets"" solution itself. That's elusive ""boulder"". person less things pollute greatest cumulative effect. essence, pollution ""pebble"" hand. 

What yours? makes sense Memorial Day protests reopening, huge uptick. functional adult little sense self preservation dont already mask means easily make one?

This absolutely ridiculous. 2018 florida 468 flu deaths, 2623 pneumonia deaths. (from link)

According CDC (who's numbers really slow come in) Florida 2645 covid deaths, 6518 pneumonia deaths (some covid) 305 flu deaths.

All told 8104 flu, pneumonia, covid deaths. CDC numbers take 1-8 weeks get updated! (see notes bottom.

&amp;#x200B;

So regardless want call cause death, 5000 people died 2020 compared 2018 (and numbers final, virus still actually hold DeSantis Trump responsible idiots politically polarizing masks. really many things control pandemic, DeSantis could mandated mask usage Trump could set example country instead literally telling people wear mask either. Mask use actually easier getting people close businesses, done first. think people basing two week prediction virus behaving March April colder climates. Heat slows spread, get jail free card. Florida, TX AZ stop building fire Pretty sure guy responding said buddy Paris said thinks mask usage less 50%. Science good all, prefer get information second hand anecdotes Reddit, sorry. hot humid weather may promote spread virus outside certainly causes people go indoors relief virus spreads easier. Yep too. understand people wanting get things, Fitzgerald &amp; Haggie looking best case scenario given positions. They've done great. CLEARLY right choice her. risking family's life sake part time medical gig provide enough PPE employees.

If assume decision told quit.. inherently sexist? Edit: found &amp; sign. Weird sentence structure, think he's blaming minorities.

Edit 2: ""Ethnic people"" still weird. Might less AC time indoors there. seems like time indoors might affect transmission rates. Sounds like heaven me. Neighbor right foreclosed/ evicted coronavirus hit house still empty. trashy neighbors yelling feeding colony stray cats come defecate property. Plus bank maintains property cuts grass making sure still looks presentable, hope put market years. neighbor fantastic, waiting house left foreclose well. getting notices pandemic I'm hoping goes quick moratorium overturned. 

Yes, realize foreclosed homes either side bad property value, family home never sold. say bring evictions, privacy :) Cool gracias ECDC able overrule national elected governments? think data exchange quick look ECDC web page. Plus, must forget data echange across *the world* even important global pandemic, Europe. Life finds way I’m happy live British Columbia. 1029 people total killed police year far, black white. understand point, number zero. Absolutely nobody ever killed cop. 

But fact remains covid responsible 120,000 deaths US totally wrecks argument, especially seems proportionally worse group top everything else.  Coronavirus fundamentally political issue rules moderators sub disservice humanity suppressing lively discussion social change problem Midwest they’re required, people wear them. “I’m sick Covid nonsense” attitude sooo common here. recommending without requiring equivalent saying don’t worry it. -30 F!  also pay MIT get MIT relationships connections, well MIT experience, something online classes give you. No, indoors. people [60s 70s baby boomer 

I wonder wearing masks entitlement, pride thing feel like they're healthy enough handle anything, even they're actually high risk category. number hospitalizations. Moving Florida fall. 

Should wild. article restaurant China seems back theory. gonna piss dad off, I'm never going hear end it. 🙄 Oh friend Paris said...my family ___ said.

Anecdotes mean shit next raw science says masks help prevent spread. 

And subtly suggest mask wearing virtue signalling. Please. Wearing masks made legal yesterday. Blaming anyone ~~other than~~below state government misguided. rich ass parents/grandparents paying rent. likely trust fund kids. work @ casino Netherlands stupidity open them. July open again.. tell casino, sex club, sauna events dance clubs closed.  Say me: government said safe reopen. Many people went stores restaurants (enclosed spaces, masks) outdoor fresh air largely masked protests. already watching apolyptic disaster movies sayin' ""that ain't shiee"" lot rural areas independent minded types, may social distancing wearing masks. Also large Latino population often essential workers live multi generational homes. 

Mask California, keep setting good example. wear clothes different argument entirely ton nuances.

I’ve never really agreed legality behind requiring helmets seatbelts. I’m them, masks, govt constitutional authority force them. want risk life it’s right so, govt get mandate that? also photo touching supposed do.

This problem masks. vitriol Reddit wanting people wear them, realistic. about, people wearing them, would say well half either touching wrong, least another 25 percent top taking mouths often totally irrelevant and/or making worse.

Example. saw one worker restaurant today removed every time went kitchen put back serving. sympathize obviously hot on, every time spreading stuff mask surface surfaces. far worse wearing one, wear serve due regulations. totally bizzare require restaurants result.

Add fact likely one properly washing sanitizing daily, causing grow bacteria make wearer ill, masks going cause sickness solve. people symptoms wear them. close friend renting away small 1960s apartments Vancouver half decade so, he's buy house six figure downpayment country. 

If one know willing drop payment lap (/s), spending 40% income rent becomes self perpetuating cycle $100k level.

A $900 difference rent adds quickly disciplined (and/or lucky) enough save good sign. Gov. Abbott Texas... ball court. Well takes time stop spreading. That’s there’s gradual decrease cases throughout NE. underestimated they're greed don’t get chose Orlando host it, should’ve gone middle Wyoming something haha China forcing people makeshift locations away families tested positive. I’m sure big factor stopping virus. locking people home families wasn’t enough Split along state live percentage year. like person moves mid year. I’ll wait =) read article, hospitalized symptomatic also? tested positive symptomatic? Nope. Sweden needs get infection burden down. Simple. 

Sweden created problem, dunno *actual* offers help fix DK NO. would SE asked I'm sure. 

The European guidelines written [in report stage, following measures essential maintain reduced level transmission avoid robust monitoring framework closely monitor epidemiological situation, rapidly detect increased transmission, assess impact interventions place avoid resurgence expanded testing strategy aiming comprehensive testing individuals displaying symptoms compatible COVID-19. particular, systematic comprehensive testing approach suggested high-risk populations settings. suggested testing berampedupand tests Member States also consider implementing PCR-based prevalence studies sero-epidemiological studies monitor spread framework contact tracing, based extensive testing, active case finding, early detection cases, isolation cases, quarantine follow-up contacts, possibly supported electronic tools sustainable implementation essential non-pharmaceutical interventions, irrespective transmission rates, ability amend strategies rapidly response indications increased transmission. Reinstatement introduction measures could considered local regional level, specific population groups, depending transmission patterns. Protection vulnerable at-risk populations paramount importance suffered burden pandemic terms morbidity, mortality need healthcare. strong risk communication strategy remind citizens pandemic far over. People need aware public health measures limit spread virus continue impactthe way move, work travel, leisure activities foreseeable future. especially important Europe moves towards summer holidays, changes people’s behavior, activities movements may cause people switch back pre-pandemic potentially risky behavior key risk communication messages proposed: marathon, sprint. must drop need adjust ‘new normal’. actions give us power control spread virus

This EU countries Sweden doing. Sweden bad behavior blame closed borders. Nordics willing help Sweden turn ship around I'm sure, simply **not** willing end part Sweden's herd immunity strategy opening borders Sweden comes board rest us, gets infection pressure pivots TTI. Thankfully Sweden talking this. talking **doing**.

As posted link article details, Skåne much higher infection burden CPH. *feelings* facts. think regional solution would make sense even Skåne's infection pressure could lowered. agree Danish experts similarly critical solution: longer Sweden sticks foolish harmful herd immunity strategy longer borders remain closed. Period. I'm going bed, good night. One could say Surprise Wow noone saw coming..... Yep, started early opening day two Trump visited him. find odd though, grocery stores still closing early, Casinos open. Wtf? people hospitalized they're sick, hospitalized preventative measure?

I'm saying possible there's problem. want know details freak out. 

I'm saying someone lives works(in profession highest risk contracting spreading COVID-19) area one oldest median ages state even much encountered anyone connection COVID county.  taxes work? state gets claim income taxes? I'm european I've never heard mind sharing couple leads magical deals? i'm bay area prices gone anything... That’s polio? company went remote years ago engineers world 140 countries. language barrier issue run into. lot talented engineers hard find country. Hard know trust anymore ""experts"" lie things basic mask wearing prominent health experts applauded massive block parties across country weeks ago? I'm going engage bad-faith arguments. reading you: Also see: comparing apples baseballs. ... one expect site “click” URL? remember, positive rate random sample. People symptoms, contact encouraged get tested makes positive rates far higher infected within population.

Or people reason suspect might know show positive next question ""why go."" ""were always much fuckwit.""

Alternatively show data it'll used proof wrong protest middle pandemic.

Combined, equivalent asking people volunteer think ones killed grandma. I'd rate one percent absolute minimum given i'm surprised anyone volunteered see deliberate actions potentially infected thousands people There's deaths extremely liberal everyone wears masks Massachusetts three states combined... 18 deaths day 200... 

60 million people give shit died less 6 million running around heads cut off...

Shits fake...

We need close schools needed close nursing homes... Yes, problem antibiotics, still occasionally outbreak. 

There never, ever example disease defeated due herd immunity vaccines. name one? question, usually states cases risk getting rona ‘close contact someone talking within 6 feet least 10 minutes’... 10 minutes come from. 

I ask today UPS guy came pick package dumbass, took mask say ‘thank nice day’. mask half way inside house front door, hold breath asshole spoke breath anything in.

So question would possible get virus someone simply says something like ‘thank you, nice day’ ... basically &lt;2 seconds interaction 10 minutes. 

- anxious person Laughs actively looking Seattle market excited first house 1/ That's true, many people predicted ""disaster"" states like Florida countries like Sweden, woods stretch, turned medical hell feared many.

Sweden disaster, still predicting local disaster saying ""the world doomed."" moving US see despite increased number positives number deaths declining steadily far.

Let's see ages 2 weeks. support wearing masks public places, comment absolutely ridiculous many levels. Jesus. It’s going people secure jobs money. Cities lean times ahead. Beautiful work! think are??"" stories? good huh? Orlando, Florida sucks 1 bedroom apartments still go $1400. new home construction close half mil point. easy money earnt. 13 million per square mile

When look up, population density 20.6 people per km² (53.3 per square mile) Unpopular opinion virus everything technically front line. that's interesting, reason wearing around others. need safe space? Sweden bad. Even government said so. 
Stop wrong lol. parts italy started massively using blood tests. tests able detect Igg Igm. test positive put isolation get swab test. negative considered immune go back work follow rules like everybody else.
But positive close contacts put isolation.

So false negatives false positives swab matters. finding even one positive allows find direction follow tests.

The results? today lombardy 242 cases. 58 totally asymptomatic discovered procedure described. means 58 plus close contacts already isolation (usually family members let's say 100 persons) coworkers also tested (probably swab). find another asymptomatic betwewn coworkers follow procedure: test isolate.

That's even accurate blood tests fundamental step control spread. yep chinese, korean ethionpian iranian salvadoran - basically non-white non-black families know living around DC think american/western culture handles childcare elderly care grossest thing modern life. dunno different personally - old people family locked damn year, trying cast stones.

i raise DC pretty unique, lot cultures space limited assimilation. get lot old culture shit. timeline takes people get sick/visit hospital, probably means Houston week behind changing currently doing. That's big yikes them. 


I hope hospital system prepping best can. I'm from. problem landlords leaving investment properties empty creating artificial scarcity drive prices. might surprised look vacancy stats nearest city. Yup, really sad. funny thing is, still many people blame continued outbreak completely government mismanaging country. true extent, barely providing support lose jobs due quarantine, hundreds thousands individuals act like country, know else do. testing free U.S. may pay copays related services, testing rule diseases, doctor's visit get permission test. Additionally, depending insurance plan, may copay test itself.

Of course, assumes insurance. insurance, may well totally fucked. Florida holding bowling alleys essential something? look average daily cases PA 7 day span, state actually week 9 weekly average cases going down. Context here. many # br apartment since I’m assuming roommates cheap. 2br apartment split costs $725 half 15 year old apartment amenities though. Minnesota suburbs. US economy seems bouncing back really strongly. 

Oh yeah. many 40,000,000 lost jobs replace week again? Since COVID-19 going us while, start new count? mean that, count flu seasons, count covid way? Sweet home Corona. got bill almost $4,000 test. guy work work saw pictures empty hospitals NY?!? /S deal curve flattened, would testing tracing place slow spread could start reopening.

Denmark opens regionally Nordic countries meet new criterion infection.

We soon travel Europe again.

This government said Thursday, presented new criteria, means borders opened countries EU Schengen cooperation.

And may give hope Danes deserted summer homes southern Sweden sailors dreaming Swedish archipelago. Danes may heard infection pressure Skåne lower rest Sweden.

But look figures Sweden's pendant health, Public Health Authority, published today, one region meets new criterion less 20 infected per 100,000 inhabitants per week.

It shows statement DR news made.

It Västerbotten, one northernmost regions country. Regions 270,000 inhabitants, largest cities Umeå Skellefteå.

Sweden country right meet criterion maximum must 20 infected per 100,000 inhabitants per week, Portugal. rest countries EU Schengen cooperation meets criterion, thing.

The government also introduces criterion individual countries test, therefore one cannot assume list based solely infection rates look like.

The criterion countries' so-called test regimes yet known.

It also influence whether individual countries introduced restrictions quarantine Danish citizens, Ministry Foreign Affairs said.

In graphic see countries meet infection requirement. 'green' countries thus less 20 infected per 100,000inhabitants per week past week. Sweden Portugal right meet criterion.

Only Thursday 25 June State Serum Institute establish list open non-open countries.

Once country open, critical level country changes 'quarantine country' status 30 infected per 100,000 inhabitants. People defend people cough spit pandemic way they'd defend someone coming deadly weapon. ""overlooked"" mean ""sent coronavirus positive people cared there"", yes. NYC insane reason.

COVID-19 new us. someone Michigan, anti-lockdown people proven wrong side history. Hey. fucking shit. Chinese study saying antibodies likely disappear quite quickly. tested middle pandemic like NYC, results would greater 20%. months later, ~4% still antibodies.

With said, sure hell hope Chinese study incorrect. Ok 600,000 people die cancer every year. 120,000 died ""War Alzheimers"" last year. That's also ""more died Vietnam"". Around 60,000 normal flu season. get upset figures year well?  irony going hit Trump then. I’m waiting patiently.  Travel certainly decreased last three months also meant people stayed place (hopefully). agree point universities moment aiming open mid August. Statistically, students going positive little faith college students social distancing avoiding close contact activities. 

I’m western New York even restaurants seen begin reopen almost remodeling whole layouts. feel like better many states truly lab rats studying whether second wave come social distancing mask wearing. live NJ spend lot time PA. far good. easily slide back get complacent. 

Yes certain restrictions still need take safe suck. closing back cases skyrocket sucks way more.

Granted, aren’t yet, numbers significantly lower. Never say modern medicine, responses countermeasures led reduction deaths make “a unique human life” less value. ^((But also even covid wants live NJ)^) NYC #winning Asymptomatic spread virtually guaranteed variety reasons beside point.

You send infected people concentrated high risk population. Particularly little confirmed information disease transmitted.

You send child polio isolation wing elementary school. Let alone kids lived there.

They never again. lowest mortgage I've ever seen 1800/month. 20 years ago. 

How hell pay 500 house? would believe scientists?  Though full heartedly agree proposed police reforms, continued protests respectfully opinion appeared holding public health ransom demands maybe fringe groups make majority consensus.

You talking wrong person. I'm audience this. I'm fringe group. Says one wants frivolous nonsense open fucking pandemic. moral high ground talking ""empathy."" Haha fucken trash bot Take pictures them, speak store manager demand fix give free food services. 😎 me, arguing dad explicitly said ""I believe Science!"" Either cancer. Let’s stop cancer treatments let people die. 

Oh wait.... months. Ah thank you. guess like medical advancements: everyone reports invented, goes testing approval years released, nobody reports again, another hot thing talk about, already milked clicks? Safety distributing toughest part I’m fairly certain study said people belonging anti-mask party less likely take precautions virus. You’re definitely going see red people get sick blue. problem. Governor allowed county determine orders. went immediate lockdown like Bay Area, others give shit like Orange County. restrictions generally removed throughout state, COVID circulating everywhere again. respect.  Would label anti- intellectual nonconformist?

No. Imagine YouTube ads 2020.

Too bad people dumber cowboy's horse. Looks like fact governor ignored protestors kept state shut paying off. 👍. don’t want spread misinformation, I’m glad look up. prefer form educated opinion. think lot data isn’t necessarily cut dry (as in, numbers manipulated politics; deaths miscategorized; questions never thought worry recently). Forcing 100% people lose 0.5% life

How ""not getting everything want right now"" ""losing life""? productive, fun, exciting, wonderful summer still following CDC recommendations adjusting plans accordingly. replace activities others putting things year killing anyone. hand, families loved ones 120,000 people US spending months grieving dead. I'll bet puts real downer plans too. wasting human life, lockdown. big problem fake news make people distrust fake news, start distrust news. shit argument though. personally enjoy Netflix internet whatever, it’s everyone. 

There sorts “pandemic privilege” people failed realize extend others. source enormous amount ill will. Orange mans buttplug doesnt care Yes, would agree wearing mask improperly still better all. make one look like less idiot, though. Ought remove mask eat sample, eat it, put mask back on, go around touching things mask germs. seen tons people wipe moist sweaty mouth hand second mask comes off. Giving people reasons remove store lead less compliance overall. need “real” shutdown 6/7 weeks? deaths per day trending since mid April gradually opening stay home orders. Seems like working.

Freedom isn’t imaginary. isn’t binary thinking. isn’t absolute, rule better society. government sucks determining essential isn’t. town, liquor store head shop deemed essential whole time. food bank not.

And yes, competent non corrupt government might help soften blow. broke government used crisis opportunity loot taxpayers give money corporations strings attached, lots people small businesses fell cracks. see people would hesitant hand trust ability feed, clothe, shelter, provide health care families. Especially threat level magnitude.  understand currently, masks better preventing infecting others, preventing infected. said, believed case count incredibly low. 144 people infected then. think saying ineffective, think arguing masks work better one direction (assuming course arent medical grade N95 masks coupled large amounts PPE), therefore people need masks currently needed keep stock available nurses doctors. 

Our country incredibly slow respond, shortage PPE even March president reluctant believe serious issue well March. letting people chose genders like alter chromosomes pander hard enough 🙄 probably lessen initial run medical-grade masks, erode public trust proclamations time :( true, reality would Trump's enemy, mine. church's bullshit improv guesses vs right answer. Fuck church. Religion handicapping us fucking centuries now. ENOUGH! Mask up, plague rats! like it, downvote move on. Lol. You’re kidding right? You’ve announced number times policy wrong. CMO, politicians... everyone cept apparently lol two key arguments right using:

1. free country. can't tell do.
2. pandemic overblown virus dangerous

Are exactly things people defending protests saying. can't one group following social distancing another time. 

This rocket science. France, everyone wears mask including children 10 schools &amp; teacher well everywhere, cannot even enter grocery stores without allowed minority, needed well goin doctor dentist closed space . Even [extrem right wing it. YoUrE InFrInGiNg UpOn fReEdOms clarification helpful, thanks. 

It looked like comparing US vs non-US, understanding Asian medics well outside Wuhan, everyone understood do. God damn illinois well, props three doubt it. old weak unproductive people would die anyway. expensive keep alive. let die without even trying hospitals full. man BLM protests sure great idea Here's Palm Beach's latest cases/deaths appears deaths stayed pretty constant area since pandemic began. Lately cases spiking however. Makes sense. one beach around Del Mar go Ocean Beach thinking saw almost one them. Can't fix stupid though lol think thinking Texas. Alabama left particular thing municipalities CA twice population Florida.  Heat also dries lipids denatures protein.

The sunlight works faster. Florida, Arizona, Texas... disagree. Another lockdown inevitable. 

Whether government mandated self-enforced individuals. We're still early stages pandemic, still seen worst it.  love OC lot people masks, feels like good 33% 40% either wear anymore extremely negligent it. 

TONS masks worn nose.

I saw large gathering moms park yesterday ton kids. single mask sight, social distancing. would great *they* died instead others. masks prevented getting virus I'd say go ham! want die freedom mask? Godspeed! protect them, potentially protect *from* them. makes anti-maskers selfish group people fucking planet. Yet Texas open long now?

Phase 1 Reopen Texas plan took effect May 1, 7 weeks ago tomorrow. (Currently we're Phase 3, far average person concerned, we're basically ""things 100% back pre-pandemic status."" least major cities require businesses require customers mask up)

Looking back liveblog notes April 27th, Phase 1 took effect allowed retail stores, restaurants, shopping malls, movie theaters, museums &amp; libraries reopen 25% capacity. (As in, think store capacity 100 people local fire code -- could 25 people premises, including employees.) Also allowed counties low COVID case counts -- 5 fewer cases, time applied ~100 254 counties Texas -- reopen stores restaurants etc 50% capacity.

It also allowed licensed doctors, nurses dentists resume work minimal restrictions. expressly allow hair &amp; nail salons, barber shops, bars gyms reopen time. Salons &amp; barber shops got reopen 1 week later; bars got reopen 3 weeks later, time Memorial Day weekend. many people believe driving surging case counts now. Well that's terrifying. near ten percent difference plus made number up... Getting Floridians wear masks...enough matter??? know man...I live here...the stupid Trump Evangelicalism strong folk here. Also there's heavy strain Real Men Wear Masks boot - - yeah - I'm hoping thing burns sooner later 'cause that's got going us here. incredibly damaging stance take. understand misled public, time-sensitive need protect healthcare workers, get that. clear evidence even cloth masks could help. 

The CDC claims changed stance mask-wearing due recent studies, think investigate it’s common East Asia wear masks? think millions people wear completely ineffective masks fun? 

It’s new concept either, cloth masks proven effective Dr. Wu Lien Teh 1911! (Obviously measures important stopping plague, masks seem certainly played role.) can’t believe instead ignorant facts, Dr. Fauci suggesting knowingly misled public. 

How many lives lost future pandemic public reason distrust top public health officials? Lives saved short-term, wonder long-term cost higher. learned nothing time disease spreading outside China... article isn’t addressing affect masks regard limiting viral load air.

It address pretty directly actually. fact, spent paragraphs talking Mask stoppage efficiency host inhalation half equation, however, minimal infective dose (MID) must also considered. example, large number pathogen-laden particles must delivered lung within certain time illness take hold, partial blocking mask cloth enough make significant hand, MID amply surpassed virions carried single aerosol particle able evade mask-capture, mask practical utility, Yezli Otter (2011), review MID, point relevant respiratory viruses infective humans tissue culture optimal laboratory believed single virion enough induce illness 50-percent probability MID (“TCID50”) variably found range 100−1000 typically 10 3rd power − 10 7th power virions per aerolized influenza droplet diameter 1 μm − 10 50-percent probability MID easily fits single (one) aerolized classic description dose-response assessment provided Haas Zwart et al. (2009) provided first laboratory proof, virus-insect system, action single virion sufficient cause Baccam et al. (2006) calculated empirical data that, influenza humans,“we estimate delay ~6 h, infected cells begin producing influenza virus continue ~5 h. average lifetime infected cells ~11 h, half-life free infectious virus ~3 h. calculated [in-body] basic reproductive number, R0, indicated single infected cell could produce ~22 new productive Brooke et al. (2013) showed that, contrary prior modeling assumptions, although influenza-A-infected cells human body produce infectious progeny (virions), nonetheless, 90 percent infected cell significantly impacted, rather simply surviving say that: anything gets (and always does, irrespective mask), going infected. Masks cannot possibly work. surprising, therefore, bias-free study ever found benefit wearing mask respirator application.

I way verifying accuracy this. find upvote/downvote spread interesting. willingness examine challenge beliefs often path reinforcing hold scrutiny. contrast seems though fully politicized, even objectively incorrect statements ""pro-mask"" (whatever that's supposed mean) upvoted blind. Hell, reason Oklahoma well nobody wants spend enough time make catching Covid feasible threat. summer!!! /s Maybe lockdown forever side care that. think government use taxes help everyone make ends meet instead writing wealthy people another series blank checks. live Maryland, absolutely crushed curve. closed borders people states getting hit hard would probably lot. people bbq outdoors memorial day, dude. Indoor transmission. people equate warm weather safety viruses. paying attention experts told warm weather stop it. Interesting, makes lot sense actually. really prestigious school like MIT going lot students would rather classes person decide drop semester, really comparable option switch to. Whereas state schools pressure person students could likely find another school going person, community college online save money. seeing AZ FL TX CA actually first wave, locked too. second wave North East going look like August september. point think sponge wearing pants would better leader DeSantis. Good. Let them. Certainly sad, yeah. Whether that's reason shut country matter values priorities. know fall. Another way say thing written names everyone skilled nursing beginning pandemic, January 18, half would gone even without COVID. Skilled nursing residents make huge percentage death toll COVID. Kind takes shine off

They rename 'Zealand' honestly thrown out. virus really made us reevaluate necessary. 

I idea wasting much time money retail items.

 Lunch, coffees, dinners, many unplanned trips store, non-essential travel... allowed restructuring priorities miss it.  

I can't imagine going back old habits later conservatively saving $12,000/year. saying jokes checks out? looks somebody want lot Swedes get sick die.

Another strange thing test people ""low"" symptoms.

This makes sense all, somebody low symptons obviously infect somebody dies.

If need decide test school teacher lot contact people low symptoms guy live alone contact anybody, makes sense test lonesome guy, want minimize number infected.  remmeber articles that's last saw asked noticed anything strange way smelled tasted things still now. said ever since getting sick getting really strange dreams. It’s June article came out, fucking America wake please!!! I'll go right ahead say dont give shit school shooter shoots bully teacher saw happen didnt anything it.

Obviously dont condone it, really dont give shit happens. Similar 90%+ americans dont give shit drone strike kills innocent afghani children Still early say failed containing cluster. case number came little today. visiting Arizona various states started making announcements COVID.


There lot people (which normal time)... However, amount coughing going (just stay home!) San Diego you? live Bankers Hill area see lots masks. people walk far away might wear seem them. stores it’s basically 100%. also mandated (fairly conservative leaning) office.  must mistaken, obviously Florida full dimwitted sub-humans.I really disagree part, disagree implied notion rest country full enlightened folk. Florida Man everywhere, many Florida Men know transplants. Now, become stupid arrive, that's subject worthy study! Unfortunately, probably normal. Stress + lack preventative care visits hospitals overloaded back March. joe rogan thinks manly That's true there's also pretty damn solid resources like Wikipedia give pretty good tether reality. like there's alternate Wikipedia positing alternate facts, anyone submit edit site, go page I'm familiar topic can't spot misinformation. perfect tool solution there. Thanks proving point, actually. last “school shooting” 2019 50 year old man shot 28 year old ex, happened school grounds. Go rest 52 “school shootings”, you’ll find many aren’t actually so.

It’s honestly amazing blind people real facts statistics, guess expect people particular sub “feels reals”. And, clear, anyone says ""of course cases, we're testing more,"" actually peak testing numbers. testing 37k/week peak, tested 30k last week. people Reddit also tried tell 120,000 people dying 2million+ infected drop bucket using logic 2000 people outside protesting murder nothing worry about.  Lmfao what? dumbass wrong jailed it. Terrible excuse mother. ones? survive spanish flu? Cause others scale one. parent fucking way would pay MIT “online”. Science says hi: Sadly try bring attention increasing danger Florida vulnerable aunt uncle lives due thier age health risks keep repeating ti back due increased testing remind cases false positives deaths related virus gets reported covid points low numbers cases thier town. Still nothing yo concerned basically mindset family. really bewildered point cross fingers hoping dont die despite taking precautions happens told dance right wrong people dying falsified pointing conspiracy articles online.  Every single day, hear new reports huge upticks positive cases. gone trouble tested first place. 

It stretch infer huge portion society soon contract, already contacted CV, yet tested. Especially considering get even aware due asymptomatic. 

With countries opening crowded venues, increasing pace go summer world's CV policy looks lot like Sweden April. increase ease lockdown take solace much less dangerous expected. 

The rampant spread take time completely wash population, give us herd immunity, end contract it. waiting 'COVID-19 causes sterility' news hit ready launch new cult

who's in? Honestly, forgive saying this, may better long run states get hit hard country give virus respect deserves. still large % people think ""its flu bro"" ""blue city"" problem. better way change minds confront covid 19 head on? Sucks come this, play stupid games win stupid prizes. Fort bend specifically Katy see bunch Karen’s older folks wearing masks. I’m waiting foot drop realize dangerous is. mental illness looks like? think depends area San Diego live in. Point Loma everyone mask everywhere, drive 5 - 10 minutes Ocean Beach one wearing mask, even walking main street. That's caving. He's still idiot trying push ""individual responsibility"" bullshit masks.

He also keeps saying cant comes focusing economy virus. doesnt want work solve problems. He's blaming millennials listening says dont *have to* wear mask *if choose to*, ***shocked pikachu*** get virus! Fuck Greg.  know, sometimes I'm feeling down, like remember believe dinosaurs. believe dinosaurs, must believe me, too. dinosaurs believe me, believe me. Yeah, that's exactly devolved. American, consider trump outrageous idiot vote left anything americans even imagine. matter, everything political now. actually thinking this. work hospital we’ve many fewer patients come hospital lately partly it’s half people area ran away rural locales darker thought sickest patients would come time may simply passed away covid home nursing home.

I suppose social security pension plans financially stable pretty grim. really think lot hospitals run serious financial trouble going forward PICS didn’t happen. guess genuinely believed Tegnell co. kept saying herd immunity coming April, May, June.

I also get that.

At time thought 2% mortality. need like 50% population sick get that. gives plan 50% population get sick disease kills 2% sick people, 1% population die.

I understand want that. 

I also undestand count herd immunity disease nobody knows works. 

It's strange assume reason totally unknown disease conceal surprises. Chimpanzees pretty fearsome teeth already teeth aren’t even scary Great Ape standards, Chimpshark would worst nightmare man. area thing younger ppl ones going makes sense. personally know 3 ppl confirmed positive. 2 50s 1 19 family say they’ve told it’s minor point would know unless tested. thing many ppl tested picking minor/ assymptemtic cases way often. “Off bat” 🦇.....I see landlord tenant? know portland tenant lived year, must given 60 notice vacate certain situations. *Arizona entered chat* nice! remember 9-11 going change everything ...

I get sense lot ""infectious disease"" experts, incredibly horrified going on, also kind enjoying spotlight.  Sorry catch it. Things clued in:

1)stocking medications studies almost unanimously proven benefit (why would stock something proven benefit)

2) going 1/6 american's suddenly develop malaria ebola (in previous outbreak, US total 11 cases ebola. 2000 cases malaria every year. ""worried"" 54 million catching it). People fucking dumb it’s worse pile feces. Everyone see near Ft Lauderdale, masks, social distancing. It’s think Rona disappeared phase openings. amount stupidity see makes feel I’m living idiocracy.  Yeah, thing is, Michigan one first states harder lockdown, one last states let up, stands reason they're better...but they're also opening up. look like 2-3 weeks? people wear masks I'm sure blame masks effective. Keep telling useless masks are, really helping. Hehehe... Fortunately let reddit karma inform validity thoughts...

But sure, vote guy calls person literally making facts. I'm totally bad guy. 🙄 Well, looking commenting history seem like quite erratic feller general, whatever floats boat guess. throw around lot.

This whole situation infuriating. Vietnam get handle virus spread population density many areas, embarrassing we're fighting wear bit fabric nose mouth. virus preferentially-target people exercise proper precautions. thought young people risk schools open safe?

Didn't watch news? news knowledgeable scientists. safe open types places put people close contact. needs listen scientists? know? Pfft. really nice see someone else say this. I've attempting explain outcome lockdown necessarily starvation, within power help people well beyond amount time would take basically eradicate virus - choose to. choice.  That's odd, San Diego seemed like everyone wearing masks except went beach understandable imo. 

Here Texas literally like one wearing them. Stores care, one cares now. That's Texas fucked. Sad see this, Myrtle Beach favorite. Spot on! Well, obviously not, Alabama Mississippi. 

Every interaction I've someone Mississippi subpar. Homophobic, racist, forth, every last one them. sad, I've met couple. apartment basically doubled Ol Miss frat condo shitty roommate thinking apartment barely moved in.

Could worse, Nebraska’s governor said cities mandate masks (at public buildings like state capital) receive CARES act funding. awesome since huge budget shortfalls. Star Wars reference. response Star Wars reference above. coronavirus circulating EU U.S. since December -- maybe earlier -- nasty flu season combination virus, overwhelmed hospitals, really useful hyper-focus finding asymptomatic COVID-19 cases end world focus instead restoring normalcy life, making sure everyone flu shot (mandatory, possible), managing hospital resources? 

We take lead totalitarian China, apparently willing suppress freedoms eliminate coronavirus. 

Instead, Japan done fine -- testing symptomatic severe cases -- basically ignoring asymptomatic/subclinical cases. (Do really think Japan 17,000 coronavirus cases? No, done widespread testing -- 348,000 tests country 127 million. contrast, Florida done 1.4 million tests population 21.48 million). think it’s drastic logical. Colleges can’t act students’ best interest. Several hospitals adult ICU beds Palm Beach County. Motherfucker charged negligence homicide prob even worse people wear masks protect themselves. referencing surgeon general specifically, Trump owns restaurant responsible cooks, undoubtedly. Texas probably catches cases Monday.

yeah I'm aware. memory serves ran calcs past Sunday, 4 days ago. Since daily new-case numbers grown higher. yeah, projection time ""by July 2nd"" turned optimistic Texas even counting probable cases

The short answer is, them. longer answer is, Dept. State Health Services (DSHS) acknowledges CDC allows including probable cases case counts, state's official policy count them. ""We want actual, confirmed cases counts"" something.

Having said that, Texas contains 254 counties, state, ranging major metropoli (Harris County / Houston, Dallas County, Bexar County / San Antonio etc) ""glorified ranches"" thousand peeps. counties count probable cases, feed #s DSHS become part overall state numbers.

As far know, nobody put together list indicating TX counties count probables versus ones don't. So, go *“Inspiring quote make think twice opting mask.”* Im Harris County reference. Maybe 50% people masks. Difference countries could avoided high death numbers no? XD Protip, would avoid using worldometer -- data shown unreliable.

Try fantastic [Corona Tracking also pretty awesome dashboard public stats Exactly. Change 100 people died poisonous snake attacks maybe people would smarten up.

When people can't actually see threat, quickly stop giving fuck. hate people. Paris says hi: use see lot people LA wear masks cautious, fell window. People playing parks, going eat friends, without wearing mask. I'm really disappointed everyone thinks virus over... good upvoted idiots downvoting missing joke. Beautiful  Excellent point! blast pepper spray might trick. *"" fact, he’s told local governments won’t receive $100 million federal COVID-19 money “customers” required wear masks. ""*

Seriously... ridiculous. 

*“The governor encourages people wear mask,” according spokesman Taylor Gage, “but believe failure wear mask basis denying taxpayers’ services.”*

*The spin mental gymnastics ""reasoning"" amazing.* Hmm.

Then guess makes wrong said ... ""Other bit quite correct."" correct then. :)

Asking Friend excerpts address aired looked social distancing masks.

Ha! known better.

I saw several people wearing masks. People standing around talking normal distances. saw looked like two men lean whisper.

If people see leaders ignoring suggested measures prevent spread take measures seriously? know anything Science? Wtf kind response this. Certainly front lines hospital that's hit. 5% (i think much lower) talk 485 000 000 deads covid alone + deads overwhelemd hospitals + deads issues appear Manpower lost (farms = food), highly trained personell lost (water plants, nuclear engineers, Professors, doctors on) luxury live say goodbye want start. Really must absolut fearless person. opinions opinions accept opinion. done month ago reopening rolling out. people keep parroting hear read like little talking heads.

Come new slogan. get J&amp;J vaccine then, one forcing you. Texas Florida. necessarily true. plenty dumb people Spain, 80-90% people wearing masks 2 weeks this. mandatory now, protests, demonstrations etc I'm aware of. US seems different kind dumb people reason. I’ve noticed vast majority wear masks grocery stores, doctors offices, banks, similar places. 

The thing many times wearing mask impractical like heavy exercise, party socializing friends, bar restaurant, etc. People wear masks going one everywhere. New York needs ban screen arrivals Florida immediately roughly 8 400 000 confirmed cases 450 000 deaths... thats 5.3% death rate globally.

Belgium, one worst handled places, worst: 60 400 confirmed cases 9 700 deaths... thats 16%

US: 2 168 000 confirmed cases 118 000 deaths: 5.4%

... etc etc Lying? so? 12% residents, 12% deaths nursing homes due Covid. find hard believe 12% NJ nursing home patients dead. can't exclude flu without testing flu, done useful extent pneumonia cases. CDC normally reports flu pneumonia deaths together (even now) that.

I mean imply dead actual snowbirds, California Florida much warmer states bad numbers, that's yet another confounding factor ProPublica's numbers. control narrative. people listen him, believe him. New York mid-March levels understandable. People start cutting corners see end approaching. 

Problem rest country follow suit even though nobody steep short duration curve NY Except Florida tax base, tax base, tax base, trouble.

The tourists gotta go FL rent hotels ABnB’s kids go school.

And looked Hopkins map right FL opened beaches basically wall death hundreds miles north west FL...

How virus get items pass others? Ffs comment hoping trump get covid removed? Forgot few: France, Spain, Italy, UK, Netherlands. Depends islands. nicest parts Myrtle probably comparable smaller condos rental heavy area, part properties used year round Denial sucks travel work can’t really choose fly with. I’m looking forward going back business travel. Hopefully that’s while. fault poor low pay compared anywhere nice :( People make bad choices put others’ lives risk bad people book state government sticking landlords. work tenants landlords. Guarantee rent landlords hurt financially pandemic percentage long agree. Something along lines 75-80%. tenants feel safe knowing place live. landlords feel secured able collect rent even discount. People willing spend knowing place live. Anecdotally: quickly units manage open fill. Usually multiple qualified promising applicants pick from.

The pandemic made side job surprisingly less stressful. Avg cost unit manage: $750 month, upstate NY. Maintenance become difficult distancing.

All two ~one hundred tenants continued pay full rent. ones ones trouble before. 

Other managers locally speak seeing thing. many perspective tenants looking affordable places. Lots factors play here. Italy florida opened time italy seen spike Balcony rail saw many cloth, washable masks Target Houston. I'm assuming genetic ability fully consider consequences needed breed continue bloodline. mean probably helps. Consequences good surviving long term really matter 18 pushing kids really really liked someone. Starting get betting ring going work quarter today cause said gonna 3k loved pro life bit. never even thought like that. Guy point everything. mask compliance stores/supermarkets pretty good many let otherwise, certainly widespread mask use outside private gatherings NY. Ah crayon format cup tea yet protesters reporting significant numbers cases covid19 actually fucking followed guidelines given.  others attempting need give up. going happen.  None fooling anyone anymore thinly veiled racism. obvious one clue could happen, let guard down, happen. reason. Things opened real fast everyone like over!!! hey! :/ People saying things like literally 2 months never really borne True. touristic spot per se. numbers come eventually. look 5 year averages, compare year, determine difference likely due covid. Especially it’s 1000s NBA still going go it’s Disney plan there’s uncontrolled epidemic Florida? Houstonian too. 99% shopping Costco covid, one house always line door can’t stand in. car already AC since Costco doesn’t open 10, it’s already 90 degrees :/ going krogers 7 am. sucks. miss Costco much. 

And go krogers, realized last week 1 maybe 15 people wearing mask. enployees weren’t even wearing masks. saw multiple elderly store wearing masks. couldn’t believe it. wave going bad. people travel LA county work stuff. much OC honestly.. Whats rates Newport Huntington areas? Yeah welded people apartments like Wuhan, rather soft-ass lockdown NYC allowed people er... get groceries er ... walk around block sometimes.

Boy whole crisis smoked weirdo authoritarian fuck-heads. Nyc closed 3 months spikes 3 weeks protests Memorial Day everything still fine think it’s problem New Yorkers go outside yes magic pill work greatly stem spread virus many studies show work there's lot real world evidence effectiveness countries South Korea I'd say 50/50 workers wearing masks though least customers. blessing Ohio nobody comes unless absolutely to. Good luck south that. must ever worked food service. 

that shit gets contaminated. virus going away, know healthy fight virus, trying protect vulnerable anything. vaccine help Sadly seems loud vocal minority cry mandatory masks ""Taking away freedoms"" something like that. UK connected mainland Europe tunnel. New Jersey start building CDC March. know make mistakes it? Another real South Bay resident here.

There lots pockets conservative older upper middle class folks Fox news consuming, muh freedoms type refuse acknowledge issue. surprising bc many highly educated.

But overall LA county there's sense whatever towards pandemic. There's fatigue, turning point really towards end April initial protests lockdown occurred. People want go back normal traffic come back again, people eating out, HUGE lines shop shopping centers, pent stay home energy people releasing.

And plus OC OC help. yeah, big population, sizable population believes hoax, plus pent energies desire normal what's causing high results. Today, almost back normal levels, according Statistics Sweden.

so *almost* true, guess pretty good politician like Lofven. I've rarely less impressed Nordic politician handling issue. discussion raging Swedish editorial pages mishandling crisis going shatter public trust goverment sadly apt; I've never seen many lies distortions Nordic goverment before. That's money going.....again. Gov bright either. doesnt care anything fixing roads hes never done Tell people driving truckloads dead bodies. Could traced way back 'if get corona, get corona.' dude?..

Finally. He'll eating words soon! take week get symptoms sick couple weeks really get bad need hospitalized. said ""wait 2 weeks"", said ""it's 2 weeks"", said ""wait another weeks"", laughed faces said ""it's another 2 weeks."" 2 weeks laughing anymore, funny that, made massive cup ""I told so"" want one?  really hear things go wrong. tons things every day prevent serious problems, dont hear work therefore arent news worthy. VA?? Hes idiot... Totally agree really looks like someone *wanted* happen, still want happen. catch this: They're advising people mild symptoms go work. Sweddit brigade tried defend ""only doctor says ok!!!11!"" like somehow makes piece lunacy better. 

It's really clear goal *has been* allow disease spread controlled rate society. Whether that's produce herd immunity patients Giesecke family's clinics reason hard say sure. 

As testing severe symptoms things *very* charitable Sweden, Denmark able ramp capacity. HOWEVER Denmark *did* ramp capacity *quickly* HOW! seen [this super heartwarming shows done country like Denmark puts mind something! 

Thing is, fully buy similar outcome possible Sweden. said, know exactly *why* Swedish officials making totally empty promises increasing test capacity *weeks* figuring anything out. There's finger pointing every direction. pretty hilarious complication officials shifting blame onto regarding ppe problems: testing same: regional officials blaming national officials vice versa, regional officials blaming municipal officials vice versa basically manner blame flying every way one taking responsibility actively anything fix situation. One big hangup easy identify though national government promise funding early month. They've pledged around 7bil SEK IIRC, resulted uptick testing. pathetic performance Nordic country even European country. Even US brought testing less control already. SWEDEN countries *maybe* figuring wild. 

Sweden badly mismanaged every level bit incomprehensible tbh. stance get go.

 Hoax real, whether kills not, wrong sacrificing 1 year life quarantine (which still freedom want). Whoo! Thank God ""only"" 20% octogenarians (it's actually 'octogenarians', let's go humor you) require hospitalization. That's bit luck! course, sure would SUCK among 20% - many heavily sedated ventilator jammed throat since lungs essentially filling superglue.

/s Houston man file lawsuit contact tracing. 🙄 Let's call potentially good news stop arguing semantics would improvement. might opened like 2 weeks ahead schedule. 

They've broadly abdicated responsibility state level. trusted spread COVID can't trusted buy alcohol Sunday noon vote mail /s. I'm way saying fail contain. might, might not. going game whack-a-mole out. SpaceX actually mostly California. CA good launch pads Florida. comes surprise Michigan one states governor refused back angry mob early days. People stupid better governance say...Arizona. 4 years type thinking .. might rethink country want citizen of... dumb people every state refuse wear masks. matter location, political stance, population.  We've 10,953 new cases Sunday-Saturday last week far 25.2% *all* confirmed positives. get thank you!

So whenever someone marks infected anonymous code uploaded. app presume coded look every x hours cross references codes codes database? Sounds almost blockchainy implementation.

Are different flags come contact someone tested yourself? red, amber, green type system. age, height, weight, pre-existing conditions? That's testing took week two get results virus left unmitigated. virus doubles based huge number factors, virus double matter every 17-21 days. case mitigation efforts would change curve, double rate adjusts based human activity prevention measures, hard formula number go of. Arizona here. Thanks. Hope stay safe too. Chinese bot? much better evidence get without honest gov't? Forget USA, trying little jab? :) test, cases, any. Well looks like question cannot fully answered stupid auto mod. 

So short answer yes mostly fatigue. People gradually stopped caring since stay home lifted. People walking around stores posted mask requirements without trouble. like masks need one drops plane crashes. Smart man applying common sense, something u dont see much days America... Still waiting start edging HIV TB's numbers. HIV take long, TB might much later overtake. Facts.

I legitimately wonder Disney World going look like opens. Say me: PROTEST SPIKE. 

Gee wonder gatherings 10s thousands would lead increase. imagine he'll say 20th interested, subreddit long term symptoms. r/covid19positive sars flu strain either Common sense would research realize virus implement fear, live life don’t watch fake ass news take damn mask it’s needed😤🤖 I'm Antivaxxer antimasker personally want wait little getting brand new rushed coronavirus vaccine. reason comfortable date rest vaccines they've given many hundreds millions people, many decades, know risk adverse reaction extremely remote. too, Lakeland nuts can’t leave house without someone without mask getting way close also higher normal pneumonia deaths Italy COVID, eventually decided higher normal pneumonia deaths, COVID running amok well anyone thought reached Europe. I'm defending Florida's numbers stand now, counting excess deaths particularly accurate way correcting them, either. infectious disease? Risk death risk death.

Don’t worry stance right wing left wing. look merits own. wing ends taking view fairly arbitrary. Sweden, example, far right wing party roots Neo-nazi movement fighting shutdowns left want open things up. Generally opposition takes contraction stance, nothing inherently right wing either stance. Generally lean left think left issue wrong. never go along say simply oppose right.

It isn’t thing whataboutism. asking question fear actions taking calibrated hard numbers level threat facing? Living lives involves assuming level risk constantly weigh benefits. example, climbing ladder super risky. leaky roof inconvenient. like live dry houses don’t rot. generally happy assume risk climbing ladder, hiring someone else assume risk us, benefits outweigh risk. isn’t risk remove lives without significant sacrifices, including public health. Unless sober actual level risk compared risks assume, won’t know response harmful disease itself. Indeed many people like WFP think die shutdowns disease. predict 300,000 day.   Right. States went safer home plans earlier seeing better results opening up. covid flu strain Whats going happen Florida fall? Aren’t viruses heart attacks part nature? post different source, probably TJ's stops everyone door, waits people exit, provides hand sanitizer asks maintain social distance. Pissing parents act like best idea shit say. numbers - using numbers thread. show numbers think correct.

Edit: Alternatively, explain excess I'm Hudson Valley - everyone going liberally, almost everyone wearing mask. stores require point. numbers speak themselves. Mask wearing obviously essential beat thing. listening podcast ""What Day"" interviewed contact tracer said hard even get people phone. comfortable enough tell you, assuming even remember, close contact last handful days. People make contact tracing like silver bullet lower spread seems like that's necessarily true people understand that, well understand anyone might die anything time, including themsleves.

When beaten repeatedly breathless language, stops useful information starts fear mongering. That’s nerve wracking. judge block Newsom issuing new orders without going legislature? think good thing, seems like cop act like he's actually something. basically like Pascal's Wager. Either God exists doesn't. believe big deal. Minimum risk. believe, screwed. 

Same masks. Masks either work don't. wear one... harm foul. wear one, we're screwed. wear it. Breaking news! Water wet. Yup, 'two weeks...' posts annoyed heck me. thought cases going go up, knew would take longer two weeks reflected. two weeks passes major spike, everyone else goes ""see? nothing happened, let's keep getting back life usual."" SARS vaccine. Covid isn’t going away. 
Most people aren’t wearing masks. SARS likes mutate. Soooo yea. 2020! bought two KN95 masks local Ace hardware $8.00. seal well, bit restrictive 3 layer cotton / Filti homemade ones. Urbanization probably plays part. hypothetical country one giant metropolitan area surrounded millions square miles uninhabited wilderness low population density lots people living close proximity, facilitating spread viral infections.

This entirely explain Sweden however. higher urbanization rate Norway Finland, similar Denmark.  There's still risks associated getting blood transfusion.   Wastewater treatment plant workers already wear PPE standard would limit ability contract virus even transmissible feces(it almost certainly is). *could* refrain undermining others' lockdowns. wait till Trump's big rally Saturday. can't even imagine many super spreaders huge maskless, side side crowd loud mouth screamers spitters. virus irony receptors, know prize target mind! Mayors going make mandatory. Duecey announced he’s going leave them. 

Like coward. initially thought that. realized reservations mean nothing. Tickets first come, first served, show up.

Then goal became embarrassing Trump. one ever thought he’d believe million requests come in. trouble lot people live die  Yes super expensive $3995/M 2/2. Way much.  also 10 people picture besides sheriff, means contributed average $100 each. raised per person local elementary schools bakesale adults raised. legal? easily accessible info yet long virus lasts surfaces Well, appears get it. protests started Memorial Day. honest, even Memorial Day impacts bad states. Unless comes taxing billionaires. billionaires panties sure get bunch someone brings rich actually paying share taxes. ""This line work inherently dangerous, risk take sign job. Today, risk COVID-19 virus. Saturday, held campaign event, likely came contact infected individual.""

How put sentences next realize he's saying result ""inherently dangerous"" job rather idiotic decision hold campaign event? you’re dumb, everyone seems smart you.

When dumb, everyone seems dumb you. [Dunning-Kruger Dumb people tend overestimate ability, smart folks tend underestimate theirs. fair, act actually enforcing measures would increased chances catching it.

also, unless fine people really way enforce measures without increasing spread(ie jailing people) Good.

And anyone wants come ""hurr durr celebrate,"" stuff it. Preferably ass. 

People like assholes *killing people.* past weeks arguing COVID19 bad initial predictions, lockdown good idea, despite COVID19 killing 100 000 Americans lockdown enforced.

To credit, Michael Osterholm CIDRAP start epidemic guest, time went started talking shit, culminating Elon Musk spewing ton ignorant garbage COVID19 podcast. Remindme! One day danger wiping virus quickly.  population little built-in defenses friendly breeding ground whenever virus inevitably slips again. !RemindMe 2 days Lol friend went something similar. Lived place 8 years. Landlord tells she’s got bad news needs finally raise rent. went $35 😂 certainly agree on. Thanks chat - good night. got invited older family members make plans Fredericksburg Fourth July weekend. inexpensive hot air balloon fest main attraction expect business usual Main, especially hot summer holiday.  Wrong admin that. Science matter them. Buttery males. young people's fault! /s. 

I'm even young Abbot dickhead saying that!  see ages acting like everything fine there's pandemic here. us older people care would they? examples act pandemic failing miserably crying like spoiled brats. please keep politics this? Oh, stop celebrating people getting sick. don’t know able turn “made kids” video settings, I’m able add video playlist YouTube marked “made kids”

It’d nice could save somewhere reference later. Yep, check charts worst states takes looong time start decreasing shutdown. Victorian, quite harsh lockdown measures, feel we've easing way quickly. basically went ""you can't leave house"" ""go see whoever want, whenever want"". Restaurants reopening, indoor gyms to, we've barely time evaluate first easing lockdowns going cause spike. seems like might've - hopefully Daniel Andrews take appropriate warning sign stop rushing reopening process space incremental easing like month apart instead fortnight. Bye Felicia. flu, bro! 2018 election buddy. isn’t gaining followers. really matter bunch obese, retarded racists die? Target terrible company work for. care much pay. answer anything tho. question northeastern states hailed model FL better every measure. response say wait, might bad? rent go every year? People can't afford it, end moving every years starting process again. terrible. People's PAY go every year - rent does. Oppressive hell! plenty people 35 thing. sample size small-midsized town people refusing wear mask 30 (and 40). first election history could plague. perfect like Lon Cheney's? Oh wow. Yeah totally know this. 
/s

No shit. let people through. shouldnt even point out, canyon difference people moving cause dont understand lockdown pandemic is.

And people moving need work survive. Trump's tombstone read "" Lies Donald Trump, Always"". teacher Florida too. district announced three options students: person, virtually taught bell schedule, fully virtual (their version Florida virtual school). Teachers get decide want person teach remotely, numbers want virtually taught. I’m pregnant due end September. doctor want back person option hopefully get virtual position school, otherwise won’t paid insurance fully responsibility pay return. sucks. big E! may Ignore virus won’t ignore  thought read several articles talks exceedingly good testing that's interesting. Yeah, seems every million virus thousand lingering complications virus. Whether turn long term complications remains seen. virus works way 70% US population, I'm sure would sort impact people ability join labor force going forward.  people could, know, vote. 

We get leadership choose, turn, deserve. anyone tried wearing mask 90 degree weather? Don’t get wrong feel necessary idiot thinks it’s good idea visit theme park summer required wear mask heat probably good time.  Found afternoon mandatory cali wear mask. Needless say boomer father pissed loving it. Yep, essential workers. necessarily misunderstanding science misunderstanding science works. Ive mom say ""the scientists always changing mind"" attempt criticize advice.

Well, told no...they dont ""change mind"" changing advice based new information brought new studies, science changes evolves curate information. static , science, would religion. 

Anyway, scientifically illiterate people dont understand scientific process, see constant Informational updates ""being unsure"" facts, rather moving closer facts means information becoming available. many suspect articles medical advancements coming Israel nothing actually ever comes it? Considering many people wear masks covering nose, maybe mouth breathers bad... Gotta hedge bets man. going let virus run rampant never closed anything all. 


Hey, starting get it! America specifically problem this. ""vaguely historically"". though? Maybe Qannon engineered it. Imagine thinking mental health priority actual conflict. Swedes sick head anyways, they're estrogen-filled anti-depressant swallowing narcissists Same. Live Los Angeles wear one daily walk. one else wears em.

Start giving citations. $50 gotta start marginalizing people instead trying rehabilitate them. yet still said don’t wear masks early days they’re particularly effective individual protection. N95’s effective, really appropriate common low-risk public situations anyway. lockdown shortage PPE, can’t say “everyone wear N95’s”. basic message “masks don’t work” true conversation time whether surgical cloth mask effective protecting individual context low risk low community spread COVID. LIED far COVID spreading undetected due testing delays. knew it, Chearleader-In-Chief kept insisting fake news.

Today, mask conversation changed. we’re talking whether cloth masks help prevent transmission COVID wearer others. helpful because, everyone wearing mask, reduce overall risk get faster healthier minimal disruption except wear simple cloth mask also doesn’t take away PPE healthcare workers. 

So seem mashing two different scenarios concluding nothing true. 

Fact: cloth mask helps prevent spitting face talk. Please wear one. o7 100% agree!!!!!!Very self quarantine a.don’t feel sick b. don’t California behind testing Gov. Greg Abbott said closely watching hospital capacity throughout state moves forward phased plan reopen businesses peel back restrictions gatherings “We remain laser focused maintaining abundant hospital capacity,” Abbott said press conference Tuesday.

This like climate change. threshold is, ""I'm going wait reach point return,"" already going exceed it.

This endemic virus community.

You're going end collapsing health care system. Texas knows course that's Dallas encouraging everyone get hospital visits way there's still functioning health care challenge many people tested positive visited many different locations, makes exact infection site “difficult pin one particular location” virus spread, said Mark Escott, Austin Public Health’s interim medical director health authority.

Yes. exactly thing thought reopened order mitigate risk. know virus smarter measures try limit spread. need everything make sure hospitals provide full care, Covid emergency care Money politics problem. Oil companies, gun advocates, ""re-open"" advocates anti-science there's money made. saying people symptoms wear masks astonishingly dumb. Hot take: retrospect government done nothing, let cases organically skyrocket late anything. would people convinced virus dictates economy govenments' attempts protect people it. HOT WEATHER KILL IT! Americans actually think way. 100% sure happened closed thousand Americans suffering exactly this, including husband. 4th month in, still can’t walk around block. healthy before. He’s joined large nationwide group trying get doctors acknowledge exist. Exceptionalism. millions huge stretch. IL, thanks joining us. Hopefully jump soon. saw advising America (yes, American here) used masks anyway. figured they're right, still hurt reusable ones they're wrong, people danger don't. made sense logically would help some, mention people Asia wearing masks try help stem spread. Alex Jones, you? Truth subjective thing, one easily tainted manipulated. agree statement ""science truth"" can't help cringe imagining consider true. Hopefully math one thing deals absolute truth. NY's positive test rate .9% today dropping. testing per Capita highest world (higher South Korea). NY conducted 3 million+ tests, nations. Contact tracing stopped bigger outbreak Oswego b/c tracked back Apple Factory. numbers getting better better here, even opening up. Assuming going restrictions month make sense I'm gonna go ahead wait responding Europe virus control keeps borders Sweden shut. Yes. American abroad embarrassing. florida spike started week ago. Hospitilations soon already trending up. problem cult ignorance United States, always been. strain anti-intellectualism constant thread winding way political cultural life, nurtured false notion democracy means ""my ignorance good knowledge.""

Isaac Asimov, Column in Newsweek (21 January Anti-intellectualism … first got strong grip ways thinking fostered evangelical religion also purveyed many humane democratic sentiments. made way politics became associated passion equality. become formidable education partly educational beliefs evangelically egalitarian. Hence, far possible, anti-intellectualism must excised benevolent impulses upon lives constant delicate acts intellectual surgery spare impulses themselves. 

Richard Hofstadter, Anti-Intellectualism American Life (1974), pp. Unreason anti-intellectualism abominate thought. Thinking implies disagreement; disagreement implies nonconformity; nonconformity implies heresy; heresy implies disloyalty — so, obviously, thinking must stopped. shouting substitute thinking reason subversion salvation freedom. 

Adlai Stevenson, A Call Greatness (1954), p. 99 Hmm wouldn’t say New Zealand back square 1 2 cases though. implemented new rules prevent cases slipping borders, contact tracing anyone came contact 2 women. caseload low, it’s possible keep virus contained infrastructure place. 

I admit I’m definitely biased immunity thing someone living Northeast, considering population NYC metro area 20 million one top tourist destinations world therefore high risk COVID, that’s small number people exposure potential immunity. Michigan, Ohio, Washington state, NOVA/Maryland also seem decent job. don’t immunity NY NJ do, tests. feel like it’s safe reopen slowly continue aggressive catching cases. 

I think main problem back March implemented lockdown across 50 states, people Arizona Alabama didn’t many cases saw unnecessary. they’ve reopened failed test + isolate, small numbers cases infecting people unchecked (just NYC February). guess view 3 months behind trajectory northeast went through. 

I took offense idea can’t reopen even 0 cases, argument totally valid reopening without testing infrastructure dangerous. epicenter moved away Northeast South, see whether shifts political South Southwest establish infrastructure did. Though full heartedly agree proposed police reforms, continued protests respectfully opinion appeared holding public health ransom demands maybe fringe groups make majority consensus. disregard public health assert unsupported agenda detrimental kinds representative democratic change need have. find incredible even though executive actions throughout local, state, federal level continued see protests representatives bending fringe groups. Unfortunately partially protect you, unless completely sealed filter pretty unlikely. 60% rule thumb, actual number depends contagious virus is. forthcoming pegs 82% novel Coronavirus. one denying exist, certainly wasnt. doesnt make common. airborne transmission far common surface. trade breathing spit touching face bit bad. people get used figure wear becomes less issue. deep lasting love ADHD people, amazing interesting perfectly unique!

I'm anti-vaccine all, trust adminstration get vaccine right safe. sure trust rushed schedule, certainly US. agree you. I’m nurse beginning nearly impossible person certainly get tested. literally discharged people sick enough get admitted “just assume self quarantine, come back difficulty breathing”. anyone get test. whole family went Dodger Stadium yesterday got tested, none us symptomatic laws coming next week wanted give peace mind. got results back less 24 hours let tell place packed. going post comment everwhere ?

Dunno UK mentioned though.

They’ve got nothing us.

Probably it’s rag sun. Sorry that. [Here's better March 8th, 144 confirmed cases US. PPE supply low, course said mask unnecessary time. Risk infected incredibly low, needed save PPE people actually needed it, like doctors nurses. Someone lot smarter might able correct this. country like Germany might good example. feel like they’re far medically advanced US due open-minded comes treatment listening science. 

I truly hope COVID-19 pandemic help usher science friendly mindset, long health industry keeps making $$ closed minded politicians (from sides) keep getting elected won’t see change. 

I hope lot people find candidates embrace way thinking instead bashing like last preferred candidate. feel like chance past election pool we’re stuck two old school close minded thinkers presidential election. Florida’s got highest rise daily cases recently I’m sure specifically numbers haven’t come sooner, matter time

Especially people still don’t think it’s serious is. 14 day period really doesn’t help sort people think they’re fine breaking rules even aren’t intentionally, assume week something like going beach, haven’t got symptoms must fine. reality lucky enough come contact it.

But people get careless stop thinking it, worse it’s going get. mean look numbers globally first started properly spread pushed strong-armed “straight lie” “leadership” still insists wearing mask sign weakness 🙄 OSHD took numbers. We'll see come back same. Northampton I’ve seen same. One simply quarantine Floridaman need go amusement virus! Could peope anymore selfish entitled? 

Want fun way get corona virus? go roller coaster sit back! Everyone’s germs blow directly mouth! Bitchin!  grab handrails 100000 people you! Exxxxtreme!  always wondered come never hear somebody going postal hospital insurance office considering many armed nutjobs there. right left anti-science way. right far worse get wrong. That’s assault Yeah, mean, hanging 95-degree weather wearing mask sounds terrible...but answer pandemic be, ""So let's wear masks"", ""So let's maybe open amusement parks."" cares Thanks! Yeah fuck ""experts"" anyways? No? Dude there’s thing called immunity. virus can’t infect many new people March. notice something

Areas require masks seeing decrease cases

Areas dont require masks seeing increase cases.

But cant find common link supported theories espoused anti-semitic text [The Protocols Elders Jews plan global domination. devil helping them.  

Ford ... paid print distribute 500,000 copies “The Protocols Elders Zion,” renewed popularity America among today’s neo-Nazi white supremacists. Historians say book — hoax first printed Russia 1903 claimed reveal Jewish plans global domination — would likely forgotten, Ford’s reprint English (this 1927). 

Adolf Hitler called Ford inspiration kept photo automaker behind desk. ... 

Hitler said considered “Heinrich Ford leader growing Fascisti movement America” “admire(d) particularly anti-Jewish policy,” adding wished could send “shock troops America” help Ford get elected president. Historians say Hitler distributed Ford’s books articles throughout Germany, stoking hatred helped fuel Holocaust. 

You're good person hated Jews much became Hitler's inspiration. Today people get trouble admiring Hitler. Imagine effective undermining Jewish race Hitler admired YOU. sub auto-bans politics even culls posts political, going become increasingly difficult talk openly going America. One side overwhelmingly refuses wear mask side mostly does. leaders one side clearly leading bizarro death cult mask war shenanigans.

The problem is, heat drives people inside virus spreads. don’t get it, see time. don’t use cover *all* faceholes, what’s point? security world won’t matter leave front door unlocked unguarded red carpet inviting anyone in. masks likely useful, seems uniquely American obsession western world.

My friend France usage Paris way 50%. Family UK report fifth people wearing them.

All places crushed curves.

Is near-obsession veering signalling? Why's different rest western world? Absolutely chance, that’s like asking chimpanzee produce offspring shark. Coronaviruses influenza viruses closely related all. dumb hill legislators die on. Wearing mask *hardly* inconvenience. Oh, yes indeed. I’m picking you’re putting down. It’s complicated, stay home 100% wear masks can’t maintain social distance. don’t get people can’t without orders wouldn’t sure McMansions. it’s far enough outside city offer isolation pandemic prices may go up.  least they've corrected course County, rural northeastern Oregon county home state’s largest coronavirus outbreak, voluntarily returned Phase 1 Gov.

No...pneumonia flu probably lower death rate also targets elderly, yet flu pandemic literally witness change anything. sTep snEK social distancing, said comment replied to. ridiculous point. already know we've gotten clinical treatments drug reduce death rate. metric, frontloading deaths wrong move. death toll sweden is, per capita, one highest whole world. questionable herd immunity work, therefore strategy always unethical. 

WE wait. know now. massive failure. 12 days since gathering 15000 people Berlin, number certainly rising, major outbreak people speculated. personally there, best rated mask, entered mass observed pretty much 90%+ people wearing mask, went though complete decontamination got back home. mean PACKED. Keeping distance virtually impossible. However numbers coming localized areas schools, gather, still can't find good source news context outbreaks. 

However again, number Berlin relatively low, low number alone chance infection low, wide use proper mask wearing, want believe genenerally lowered numbers. 

I want take situation Berlin form speculative poorly researched proof, however want take personal reassurance mask wearing crucial. Hopefully also keeping numbers low US protests sympathize with. people worried aerosol infection, though agree, constant breeze day compensated lack movement people. really got lucky. 

I'm concerned honest, people becoming complacent, see problem crowd tightly standing crowds without masks front bars see more.

The demonstration gathering people actually took precaution sense responsibility demonstrating pandemic times, normal lives, see less less people taking precaution. Whatever say would depend data received, yes. would able make correlation. condescending ass reason direct reflection toxicity.

It's absolutely unreal want understand makeup hospitalizations accordance rise cases controversial, lol. first comment reply able give idea. sure flagrant. 30 minute, afterthought conference hot garbage.  


All re-enforce idea big deal, even Walker county, 3 local businesses reported multiple cases shutting back couple weeks.  


Abbott disgracefully bad leading people. He's good winning election. flu deaths approximately normal, pneumonia numbers gave excluded flu actually.

any deaths snow birds counted florida, counted person's county residence

edit: look CDC page compare flu plus pnuemonia plus covid versus worst flu plus pnuemonia season wanted. one blows water, even delete covid deaths propagandist

its Rifleman's creed adjusted situation... hill die masks considered magic pill. They're not, people treating easy people need call out! I’m sure naive comment 
, job find right now? feel like always better option working minimum wage . getting job painting ? Usually don’t need much experience know pay better minimum wage .  seen bump going one states numbers showing widespread declines.

Maryland 260 new cases today. places may seen small bump 6-2 6-4....but numbers appreciably spread 2nd time. Like shoe brand? funeral, guess

I mean also hospital bed ventilator could saved someone else island hasn’t helped UK. Have...you ever PRC? it’s going get worse. I’m resident masks distancing window. People going business usual. hassids Brooklyn back parties public events without masks without 6 feet distance. like minority them, most. I'm advocating lying, asking could leaders said general public exacerbated PPE shortage doctors nurses? possibility people swine flu 2009 may immunity covid19? ""When work healthcare"" still clue. fantastic interaction haha great movie great cast. helpful, thanks. 

Hopeful thinking, sounds like talking second lockdown first wave virus. Didn’t say anything lockdowns second wave. think there’s second wave deadly people walking train station past refrigerated trucks stacked bodies get drinks lads weekend? Yes.

On Folkhälsomyndigheten's web page find [these number weekly tests. shows we've gone 29K tests per week month ago, 60K last week. said still obviously far tests done overall, help explain rise cases seen June, despite ICU-cases deaths continuing decrease.

The peak first half April, seen (I know Swedish not, curious people top chart shows overall cases, middle shows ICU, bottom shows deaths). Due delay reporting go back 10 days get proper view.

Of course might plateau, might increase (that remains seen) - we've clearly passed peak first wave (with emphasis first). obviously die completely, summer travelling see irregularities, statistics right quite telling put together. funny closing stuff set guidelines people continue go protest thousands 🙄 [Can't imagine got Also semi-related  entire article’s premise mask filtration ineffective fails block particles small affected gravitational forces. Meaning it’s transmitted via water droplets falls air, remaining small countered. It’s taking filter success (aka masks) preventing wearing infected. 

What article isn’t addressing affect masks regard limiting viral load air. Find article says coughing sneezing without covering mouth appropriately bad science. that’s argument would making want prove mask use reduce amount viral load pollution air. also serves interest lowering spending social security Medicare know whose budget main pillar. Sweden made right decision lock general population cause Mental crisis

Like many Western countries high covid deaths, pattern. vulnerable refused care.

If vulnerable western countries culled regional health authorities, numbers support pandemic

""Sweden ban visits care homes 31 March. many European countries, relatives, staff union officials shared concerns protective clothing arrived late, staff may gone work start crisis despite showing symptoms Covid-19.

Now, increasing numbers workers also coming forward criticise regional healthcare authorities protocols say discourage care home workers sending residents hospital, prevent care home nursing staff administering oxygen without doctor's approval, either part acute palliative (end-of-life) check every state's graph compared reopened, count many days reopen peak, compare many days since protests. also remember reopening brought people close contact protests likely protest peak take longer see high reopen peak probably even whatever happens result memorial day (which seen yet either) try Anakin, High Ground I’ve noticed it’s especially touchy say conservatives. It’s really interesting gut reaction mainly respiratory illness would much higher rate smokers compared general population, much lower. uh, fond Hebrew corona virus fake lmao Contemporary Americans attention span bothered crisis month time need let Mike Pence handle data, flatten curve sure dont go then? thats happens US Military weaponizes virus. #trumpfluisanamericandesign I’m embarking nationwide road trip weekend. I’m willing part. known “moving goalposts.” live Denmark, dumbfounded Swedish approach. 

We similar countries yet somehow science different

Denmark weathered epidemic much positive manner

He kinda strange, hard working needs done. plot twist: in-laws 5 years old know cartoons kidding hence /s feel rage man. whole thing really highlighted worst us hopefully, (well majority) take note catalysts fueled rejection science seeing contributing kind mentality better nation going forward. also great healthcare though want go herd immunity somewhere handle hospitalizations It’s main belief daughter’s group young adults. “Masks don’t work” truly believe. It’s caused big rift friend group. don’t think Matt supports loan numbers. Yes, able get grip virus hard lockdown, way low number cases deaths point. seems mathematically impossible. also looks like ""cull weak animals"" project?

I definitely know people think that, yes, angles look like that. Kari Steffanson DeCODE Iceland said basically 'in hindsight really looks like purposefully chose sacrifice vulnerable' program: 9:56. quickly say think that's *actually* happened he's character may softening blow landed first statement. 

But tbh really make *that* much sense unless they're also foolishly ignoring possibility *creating* people dependent state disease sure substantial disability burden. cold, calculating sense much worse hit economy create disabled person unable work needs support young person previously health productive let old person needs support stay alive. disability burden outweighs costs save getting rid weak, approach even make (cold, calculating, evil) Danish know :) ad advantage big bio tech companies, helped test capacity. 

Yeah! great watch Denmark get right, part. :) strange Sweden seem fine meagre test capacity. much amp up, even asked us could tests test place Copenhagen like 10 km Sweden. could drive tests fast. excess capacity. Plus could get help setting seem really care tests.

Agreed, point feels like strains credulity country bad problems US somewhat get act together testing *Sweden* can't. seem like problem drive it. *sure* Denmark would happy help Sweden testing Swedes asked. weird haven't. engage long tradition Nordic countries helping out? would everyone's benefit here. I'm teacher Florida, I'm scared confused. want get virus, would never forgive spread students and/or families. know do. I'm stockpiling PPE, still difficult get hand sanitizer, county provided bulk business owners teachers. set classroom? school district even made masks mandatory employees. Yeah think wewalked missing demand disappear people double become homeless. They're reading things backwards: mass evictions occurred yet, demand there. apartments empty, good luck getting people fill going rate. Pretty soon, new talking point subreddit be, ""they hospitalized covid, hospitalized covid"" What's threshold people vaccinated? comes gets significant amount testing certification, typically based already approved methods.

How long put others risk waiting see safe? wrong Depends perspective. put another way, die something. infection fatality rate 1% (in reality way worse high risk people way less young healthy people let's use broad average..

Forcing 100% people lose 0.5% life, vs forcing 1% people lose say 10% life (most people die probably within decade dying old age)...

At point, wasting human life time lockdown. replied comment said wanted keep working. Pretty cut dried. letter several hundred experts endorsed them, there's media importantly authorities (mayors, governors, etc) condemning previous protests participating them, back preaching social distancing, etc, soon over. drove downtown Orlando. Saw least 200 people. 15 masks. think also matters countries drop optimism succeed conquering like China. Neither, Sweden Singapore similar human development indicies. US lower them. Ideology war problem would give gold, could.  “If wear mask? no, article dismisses chinese claims, since chinese evidence, dismissal valid. Yeah ""dark numbers"" exist ways fair say number unknown cases higher number unknown deaths.

And countries like Belgium, look bad statistics, seem low amount unknown deaths. HAH! buy loads dinosaurs 99 cent store none matter get sick die.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* even consider flying vaccine widespread use airlines comprehensively enforce masks flights.  mid 100s - lol - okay. aware Zealand real place? situation I'm New Jersey. Rent prices held steady, times even hundred dollars usual. Also kind point attempt herd immunity cases  Try counter point reasoning childishly pointing fingers. Oh no, god forbid wear mask hoax clearly made real all. make huge efforts yes. wear seatbelts, improve design, road rules, etc, end, still risk remaining, stop short shutting roads zero deaths driving. don’t take every single measure know measures simply much sacrifice level risk involved.

Mitigation isn’t lockdowns. Lockdowns like banning driving reduce driving death. yes driving also destroy organs life. loads people don’t make death statistics brain damage, paralysis, etc never recover. doubt actual numbers hubei probably higher recorded. complete cluster fuck beginning. article full shit unbelievable. numbers completely random much variation them, makes tough read. r/nottheonion So, reply point different approaches lead different results different approaches? Ok. Titans win Super Bowl default the. let Honest question. wear mask outside group? virus transmit well outside high heat / high humidity. wearing mask running almost useless, unless trail running packed people...

Obviously one spitting you, that's crazy. communities devastated initial onslaught. parents similar community Michigan, caught COVID, generally friends too.

Feels like herd immunity happens 6-8 weeks severe peak Ya feel totally ignorant honestly never made connection 2 seems like obvious conclusion. Canada does. Pretty good poutine, Nebraska joined 2020 dumbass governors royal rumble OP, I'm pretty sure wrote article based username authors name, post history. Run things spell check first man. distract content post typos like that. Keep good work though! yeap, spain locked without problem, 3 whole months, got virus control experience, age groups more, age groups seems care least masks distancing? 

When I'm see much anyone all, I'm typically week hour two early morning shopping. people got tested, anyone experienced bloody mucus coming up? got tested even hour ago I’m getting bloody mucus... ""moral myopia"" around thing.

It's funny lectured ""social moral responsibility"" people 3 cars eat meat. God bless her! dad’s us stay home since March 11th saw rodeo get shut down. I’ve keeping check since started reporting China, dad folks thought paranoid especially went nurses office take insulin (type one diabetic) chat this. knew soon spring break rolled around weren’t gonna go back school. fear graduation ceremony legacy gonna hot bed even though there’s shit ton distancing measures. hope you’re wife doesn’t test positive stays safe one relatives who’s doctor worked wards believe Ohio scare thought caught it. internet fine old boomers learnt use it. not.

Remember saying. every book world destroyed start again, religions would science would be. couldn’t tell article whether trial ended conducted hospitals not. conducted hospitals agree decision know quality randomized trials like recovery trial UK drug useless it’s given late course illness. However, still don’t good data works earlier illness. Many antivirals, Tamiflu, benefits, people take quickly. 

There indeed smaller studies shown promise I’m disappointed we’re still struggling get good data makes sense give hydroxychloroquine people considered high risk COVID-19 complications shortly diagnosis. don’t think would make sense lower risk people given side effects. Rampant spread bad. saw reports pictures NY, Wuhan, Italy Spain. Lockdowns/shutdowns necessary hospitals would overrun people, without covid, get proper care. working vaccine one thing...the bigger question manufacture distribute millions billions people. pay MIT get MIT degree make MIT money future. learn undergrad material anywhere including online. materials get complicated decent masks. Plastic shields 2 large components. Doctors already know things like this.

ex. feel you. feel like tried. they're going roll dice, they're going roll dice. think Florida got beat even health guy saying may need another shut down. Florida actively suppressing cases, fired top scientist lying numbers. know true devastation anything look excess death rates categories not. tried it, pretty sure HPD said didn’t care wouldn’t enforce anything like it. Well that’s get you’ve cutting education budgets decades think it’s super unlikely (non-TV) doctor would say things family heard regard mask wearing. sounds like kind disinformation you’d come across FB. one narcissists berate wearing mask grocery store. simply told ""Until sat car hospital parking lot holding hand sobbing 80 y/o neighbor listening speaker phone husband 60 years dying 3rd floor - due respect, opinion means shit!"" pulled mask coughed (first time allergies came handy).  left pulling parking lot - proudly displaying Trump sticker back $45K SUV - surprised. South Africa attempted murder. cases back up. It’s western Washington state. even see people wearing masks cars. think us deeply impacted right bat willing serious. place I’ve seen little cavalier church 🤷‍♀️. I’ve also heard people Walmart less masked up. That's true extent. Normal days still require full sanatation security staff, yes, far fewer people operations areas. also absolutely right Halloween event massive there. 

That said, really can't already kill off. plan things place run event, plans cancel too. Yes UV light kills it. coating lungs cough neighbor. actually work? remember hearing mouth swab test early April never panned out. seems like vast majority still scrape brain. mean general opening higher risk important masks ever.

But get it, can't eat/drink mask that's kind weird combo. That's one areas see people's finances win everyone's public safety.  LMFAO course. First ""just old folks homes showing outbreaks"". ""one meat processing plant showing outbreak"". ""a meat packing plants showing outbreaks"". We'll never hear outbreaks occurring mormon churches, million years. betting man, I'm poor MF, would bet house current outbreak primarily driven mormon churches restarting services inside. reddit response lol, though technically correct Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong Taiwan numbers decreased masks?

I’m putting two week notice soon, life ain’t worth stupidity. agree, college football. tested theories. actually little known 6th month pandemic little scientists agree comes covid. easy blame others instead questioning inability communicate efficient. said disscussion someone else cannot ask people science literate understand science work. job make people understand. failed, imo. many scientists failed communicating disease. feel want ti first discover something gave success combating virus instead collaborating. True lot politics involved made things harder, jot excuse anyone science field  No, lockdowns overwhelming hospitals also allowing time test, trace isolate programs get going.

/s I'm sure I'm capable walking chewing gum time.

States countries often competing high priority interests. Hence ownership delegated. agencies departments branches government lot high priority tasks. 

I see problems tackling systemic racism also pandemic. 

In fact, shutting actually reduced number instances violence.

Shutting down, regardless whether support it, actually helps reduce impact systemic violence also spread virus. Italy pavilion particular keep traditional. Good luck enforcing mechanism enforcement. fines. criminal. funding cities counties anything it.

I cant even find order yet, guidance. Guidance implies mandate. order ambiguous.

Also, doesnt seem specifically apply waiting outside restaurant pick food. **VERY IMPORTANT** important bits NYTimes story antibody possible asymptomatic infected people shedding infectious virus (i.e. virus produce disease); (remember WHO's coronavirus epidemiologist saying said evidence real asymptomatic transmission ""very experts noted **it’s unclear whether virus shed asymptomatic people capable infecting others. “It important know shedding infectious virus, remnants virus,”** said Akiko Iwasaki, viral immunologist Yale University.

2) Antibody tests may provide evidence past infection asymptomatic mild, antibodies disappear quite quickly, **immunity still exists**. conclusion necessarily mean people infected second time, several experts cautioned. **Even low levels powerful neutralizing antibodies may still protective, immune system’s cells B cells**.  virus faded quickly asymptomatic people, scientists reported. mean immunity disappears. It’s problem everywhere. lot people dismiss people actually study something goes want. perfect works lift lot restrictions. deployed ports entry, stadiums, airports, universities, etc. perfect catch large majority pre symptomatic carriers would huge step.

In 3.5 months, Americans, normalized 120,000 deaths airborne HIV like virus. least individual do, help fellow mankind, wear mask public.  sign respect others, shows care well-being.  people wearing masks, need remember adhere rule ""No shirt, shoes, service"". add mask that....temporarily? Coronavirus care political views, freedom,  protest, job, religion, family, life. We've got get this. Can't go around it. Wear mask. many cheap fast tests invented reported heard again. hope one yet another those.

The idea clever - spectroscopy. Fingers crossed. see post, agree. bot needs bit work. one millions Americans. planned paying student loans deferment opt option. 

Then lender made deferment opt option, thus making easier pay pay. point decided use money elsewhere. UN considers high human development, used 0.8 cutoff.

If wanted make America look bad, much better ways saying Sweden higher HDI US. hope everyone wakes up. economy get much worse. reusable hope mean single person. can’t imagine reusing test across many people would bode well preventing spread lol friends starting Crack. first started everyone lockdown social distancing. restrictions started easing still stayed pat. shit really starting hit fan going dinner I'm getting messages go grab beer. Fuck no, cases worse 2 months ago time going out.

I think people bored ready move on. Even people took seriously first way lax blows mind. cases increased 283 Wednesday reach 16,908. Deaths went 37 one biggest single-day increases since pandemic began. State officials second straight day attributed large increase deaths delays reporting one jurisdiction. cya agree. wear mask, wear seatbelt. talking banning people earning livelihood, like shutdowns. Ok, continue wearing masks? there's one party blatantly anti-science. biological sex stuff debated, one left completely burying heads sand comes science. ESPECIALLY things literally determine humans still exist 100 years - gender science nothing small potatoes comparison. photographs Florida soon shock America. People hallways.

She needs non-urgent foot surgery going come Albuquerque (she wants go back doctor foot). pain also hold plans *can* wait. hoping could finally get Houston, rest Texas numbers started spike canceled it...yet again!

Obviously, important *to us*, pales comparison importance lives save! problem less dont vote vote interests NFL billion dollar industry, I'm sure investors push hard make games go on. Especially we're locked fall watching TV normal, that's huge loss profits. Yeah, disagree you. pointing $4,000 $200. going argue something fair least use facts. Literally talking math. already bad, people need lie make seem even worse. killed boy, wanted know that. Preparedness begin with. Everyone neighborhood wears masks pretty much always seems saw 2 guys looked almost exactly same, height, face, watch, style polo, bald heads, oakleys sunglasses, walk liquor store wearing masks appearing congratulate one another wearing fist bumping driving respective SUVs. SBIII desperately trying downplay pandemic killed half million persons contaminated several millions severe effects lungs, kidney, heart brain. Can't deaths report correctly! People dont remember that. think there's huge spike exactly 14 days protests means new cases. disdain them?

you could easily figured own. anti-science bias around much, much longer COVID

Ex: Climate change, vaccines, flat earth, etc.

America anti-intellectualism problem. Still soon, hit probably show week so. put perspective... FL known great lockdown either, they're averaging round 2700-3k new cases, AZ almost there, Florida 3x many people. even close, like bottom first Sure, said masks prioritized healthcare workers, also said masks don’t really work ordinary folks, lie: ideas useful necessary. look like pay article posted, see. look like 'contributors' (or freelance journalists, charitable) write articles, vague references needing certain quality talking getting paid traffic, kinda like Medium. Deaths always lag new cases though, seeing trend several weeks back RonRon wants next Trump, happen. son teacher, wife sincere appreciation gratitude. 

The timing family someone fortunate. 8 yo son wasn’t great school ADHD doesn’t sit still long. Bright, busy. already talked home schooling matures bit. also twin 4 yo boys suppose start transition next year.

My wife already staying home years kids, planned going back work three school. Rather deal potential disruptions school closing putting teachers administrators risk, decided home school three next year. 

Unexpectedly, quite enjoyed selecting curriculums planning year. We’ve decided start school little early it’s crazy hot Texas want finish weather still cool. Fingers crossed works out!

Best luck family too! Domestic enemies Constitution. Denis Rancourt climate change denier physicist - also works “Ontario Civil Liberties Association” 

He’s epidemiologist medical doctor. 

Masks aren’t perfect work. surgeons nurses wasting time using them? 

Mask wearing reduces transmission. course virus remain active surfaces spread way. Sure, environmental factors cut time minutes, definitely possible.  Oh know that...I guess every major city US also opened weeks ago people attending theme parks?

Where cases people attending theme park then?.....nice try. That’s tried tell hasn’t direct contact like week thinks it’s safe plus job doesn’t consider necessary quarantine result seeing **week** 

I’m pretty pissed whole thing get Spirit Airlines ads they're advertising Universal. Funniest shit ever Gimme sauce 50% claim It’s almost we’ve learned virus time passed studies done 🤔

We name concept. Let’s call science! Come Texas.
We plenty ICU beds according Abbott. get government deserve. 
Can’t complain that. 

And lot lot immaginary freedoms America. People spoiled selfish. 

A lockdown won’t fly. needed April March. decided poor old unprivileged die high number. price pay. price freedom. 

If AZ TX FL ICU hit capacity deaths stay low honestly, can't remember people protesting like wearing seat belts car. unnecessarily turned political weaponized. Don’t knock treadmills much. Running running day beat people didn’t make couch :) downplaying pandemic attempt put people greater risk. lack understanding, empathy also appears complicated animal brain.

Just flu, bro. Florida doesn’t higher rate excess deaths compared many states. It’s nationwide issue. Deaths also classified pneumonia COVID. decide hold games, think correct. soon player matches ""worth-scale"", meaning worth enough team influence outcomes games, immediately change tone, start complaining much mistake playing games was, looking someone blame, we've seen issues like this. mean, study America founded, basically bunch wealthy white land owners trying protect property. Well worried would strawmen ad hominem, thank God mistaken.

I notice country decided lock take precautions specifically old folks homes elderly health care workers ... Maybe I'm callus one Masks. One ounce prevention pound cure. love god incredibly petty caterer. 

All powerful, needs test creation.

Also list things eat. I'm boat. However, Fauci video, authoritive source substantiate masks protect wearer.    
Here's article ""infectious dose"".        
It first thing occurred back March, even lousy mask impeded ingestion virus, would result milder illness?  Since case SARS, MERS, influenza (flu), assumed would case Covid-19. problem post treat science published. Science process learning world. Science strong philosophic backing time tested reasons best accurate way learning world.

Anti-intellectualism non-conformist. Anti-intellectualism proud knowing, learning. Anti-intellectualism tearing people try teach, hiding facts, treating opinion fact thing. Anti-intellectualism argument thinking outcome someone wins someone loses realizing discussion argument learned nature This, then, new illiteracy, illiteracy read don't.

*edit, additionally, partisan issue. conservative liberal problem. societal problem people every belief system guilty of, included. Maryland required masks awhile. 2 year wears hers. hard first sees everyone else wears it. perfectly wear it. possible least honest attempt get wear 2-9. How’s weather China? Lol!!!!!! When: couple weeks (surprise) ago

Who: everyone virus exposure

Why: much time have... short billionaires want keep billionaires millionaires billionaires.

What: cess pools

Where: see above

How: poorly EVER QUIT!!!!! much might think.

It people! ADDED risk death top every risk death already Covid deaths accounted ~3.33% global deaths past 3 months (450K covid/13.5M overall).

That's hundreds thousands people! top usual massive amounts people claim.

You're talking people's lives here; pretty massive %3 population dies NEW cause exist death sentence

For people is, people need know fear mongering

It's necessary there's idiots take seriously even bother wearing masks. pisses much, likely alive without scientists, scientific method, scientific progress. posting internet. mini computer pocket. Hell, computers would take entire rooms still even existed first place.

We'd probably fucking hunter-gatherers. get big deal wearing mask, see people little annoyed it, many crazy outraged it.. almost comical. sad make mandatory something simple.

Now I'm sure wearing seat belt driving drunk enforced, many people would knowing dangers it. selfishness incredible. Yeah, we're fucked. Ah. turntables have... It’ll full normal price I’m sure. Actually may add additional cost make dorm revenue. also remember. Florida 50 million people age 60. gets bloodbath Ohioan here. Can't really say much, live small city Dayton Beavercreek cases knowledge. see people wearing mask others not. Even within family. started shutting bit earlier, maybe that's why? really say I'm glad things getting worse. Exactly. adore daycare 4 year old attended since infancy looking forward sending new baby girl well we’ve decided unenroll September we’ll reassess situation. even sure September reality, we’re playing ear. 

They’ve open weeks kids essential workers fully open now. taking ton precautions, parents lobby 2 parents time, (with masks), hand sanitizer everywhere, stringent cleaning disinfecting surfaces/toys, taking temperatures staff students upon entry. 

It takes one asymptomatic kid spread around building none precautions matter. can’t risk time. It’s sad, know they’ll struggle severe shortage kids. virus can’t go away soon enough! agree. There's many all-or-nothing people here. answer everything answer nothing. We've enough time figure figure needed ramp necessary systems. Problem many places done yet lack federal leadership corral solution like one describe amongst 50 states. need real leadership enacting plan describe - would best balance helping US move forward this. ""I'm going die hypoxia!"" /s great uncle died yesterday Covid-19. Shits real terrorism lead unnecessary deaths. expensive pay healthcare elderly infected COVID expensive help everyone lost jobs forced close due virus? 100 years now.... answer seem obvious look back us morons.

Every 100 years so, there's massive pandemic still can't figure wear masks use social distancing. that’s always leave note really wear mask though. generally point valid. situations mask isn’t necessary. you’re outside hot windy day within 50 yards another person whole time, reason mask except public perception already tear gassed protesters need  Fucking GOOD! People public without masks fucking assholes. unfortunately, thing gets reported children lower risk, provision made disabilities. 

This used over, we're re-opening schools schools learners special needs given anything additiona normal school. additional funding, additional PPE, staff. provision made learners physically cannot wear mask etc (autism, CP severe chest issues etc etc)... Because, 
Children lower risk adults.

With evidence, politicians listen go - chance communicate another human bunker! Ah look scary article 😱 100 represents sum entire existence universe, yes. statement sarcastic relating post mine. Sorry offensive. Like nearly every American, I've touched horror cancer. way lot sound, Obama would somehow less? says half could symptoms, many *of them* could damage. subset 50%,  Death counts rise quickly hospital system becomes stressed. necessarily mean run ICU beds. need enough trained, sufficiently rested personnel man beds. becoming likely AZ FL headed towards stressing hospitals, see fast, sharp increase death. Well said. Oh don’t worry use conspiracy land fine job spreading ourselves. Everything’s bigger Texas amirite?? way prevent another lockdown order everybody state wear masks. heard cries open back early, part wear got dang mask!  absolute insanity. honestly cannot believe it.

The complete OPPOSITE case. counties actively taking steps slow transmission eligible relief.

People say “we can’t stay shut down” WONT ONE DAMN THING NEED STAY OPEN. 

I’m furious. We’re mercy elected officials governors point. I’m honestly scared people live trump land. Residents always treated poorly. Probably now. Look physician collective group. Maybe good things happening right made lol. made mistake reading facebook comments recent face mask article. Amongst comments man stating never wear one healthy, write note healthy patients.

HE SAID PATIENTS. get now... brain damaged 0.395 huge number?

Edit add: 113 days. spend 26 years sleeping. Better treatments better understanding COVID actually body helping bring deaths down. really fucked perpetuated scare virus gotten criminal men voluntary get solitary confinement Elections consequences. bye [Joe Rogan right people calling opening everything going “herd immunity” look Sweden’s situation. don’t need close everything need everyone wearing masks public probably focused shutdowns highest risk places like bars, churches, gyms. understand, qualify CARES act, need navigate hell state's unemployment system. lost great deal business (and likely even customers cancel) due pandemic, enough qualify.

Yep, like one : anecdotes pointless know channel. Thx. looks cool page kurzgesagt poor angry orange county Karens town council meeting upset...

Excellent. 🤦🏽‍♂️we're screwed far coronavirus concern don’t think matters much. friend created non profit 3D print face shields medical workers front facing protection. brought could use transparency film accomplish thing.

With understand would need face shield biggest protection would block direct particles exiting entering respiratory tract mucus membranes talking without mask. Really face shield plexi glass divider would help manner. rest would monitoring symptoms instructing, distancing. know it’s likely exposure top head fomite transfer respiratory tract. 

Ideally, would completely comfortable interacting someone able ask symptoms, monitor temperature, take O2 reading. Take instruction outdoors distance one another nature job without protection.

Edit: add physical therapy section speech therapy. lot kids required wear mask clinic is. distancing pull mask need do. time put mask closely interacting patients. hand don’t think concerned virus. Today temperature reading 91F o2 99, like yup checks go lay table. seen many studies tracked number pre-symptomatic cases turned symptomatic cases think would essential making distinction.

But possible studies missed infectious disease department hospital.  mask protects you, mask protects me. Ego real problem pandemic. can't come in. would helped start make mask political thing all. Depends severity. Idiots never question skeptics never stop. Stay curious friend. STAFFING BEDS?

Check guys. I'll put bed, vitals monitor, ventilator room. say another ICU bed sleep better night. 

Who fuck think cares patients? think hospital systems bunch extra ICU staff sitting around? people running beds crushed right guarantee it. hey still bed fill worries. Fucking ridiculous want stress hospital system 100% capacity. Hospitals get weaker get stressed. want getting even 90% capacity. patients proned, paralyzed, sedated. That's lot work promise enough staff. Trump talking $4000 tax credit domestic travel. Can't even make shiznit up. ""So let's maybe open amusement parks.""

I agree totally, company diversified like Disney - parks hotels stock dropped $55 $34. long time next chance significant revenue last 30 years sucked amusement parks general, hard imagine ""open die"" situation.   would eBay safer Amazon? seem likely counterfeit. anyone else miss-read orangutans? White flight Sorry put Fortnite terms please? live physically see it’s going well me. It’s like trying tell someone state without actually first hand simply listening media. Prefilters medical air handling units meant catch majority dust debris *before* gets HEPA filters, order prolong life much expensive HEPA filters. imagine prefilter setup respirator mask would work way. Proud call Governor   Straight shooting?

""Face coverings helpful preventing spread virus, medical masks purchased health care professionals people caring vulnerable/sick individuals since severe shortage. Please use home-made face covering, bandana spare t-shirt, meantime increase production.""

Etsy steps game people start helping saving medical masks pros. Finally good step, what's penalty complying? one, required.  might lockdown, means state border lockdown, like preventing everyone going Texas, California Florida. However won’t stay home order anymore. hospitals super flooded likely go sacrifice elderly patients route like Brazil does. State won’t able get funding handle extra state wide lockdown anymore. little flu. Nothing worry about. go away own. Joe Rogan saying wearing mask wasnt manly. I'm sure millions listen podcast part shaming others. I'm demonizing subsection state grew in, stop acting like can't say anything bad shithole. Hospitalization rates might higher children adults overall bad flu season. abundance Covid cases, deaths follow.  counting flu deaths, would show numbers places Covid huge outbreaks.  still likely many states counting Covid

&amp;#x200B;

 😢 RIP Kiddo... condolences family Well live actually see first hand restaurants stores doing. Keep thinking want though.   Here’s another bozo Also true. Either decision absolutely destroy kids lives. good answer. cant overlook devastating kids much creating educational gap means involved parents without needs part special needs population. guess it’s kinda shit spreads much it’s cold. People stay inside closer proximity other. winter AZ people outside lot summer.  think would mandatory stores. Germany cases going like 6k active cases atm still mandatory mask rule shops public transport hey everyone mask-wearer idling SUV waiting takeout burger wants know really conscientious stuff. honesty, Golden State get deaths deserve. Nature mercy we'll soon see rushing towards herd immunity looks like. People today may say know anyone who's contracted covid hospitalized it, let alone died. 6 months it'll like breast cancer, everyone know someone who's it. Ravenswood want public pro-science, would suggest perhaps scientist gone truth. Lying public ostensibly ""for good"" going create trust. think hit squarely head. fear going make thing want ignore much harder ignore people fall ill exponentially that. Vicious circle. So, keep mask around yahoos. protection better none. That's different argument. could annual flu type vaccine. I've heard talking like decade till handle variety strains annual virus.   means likely 

* Covid-19 continues evolve towards contagious less lethal. 
* develop better anti-virals. 

If neither happen Covid long lasting immunity acts like predator changes susceptibility population widespread death. 

I'm going focus confer long lasting immunity case lot cases. live North San Diego county mask use spotty. Many wear stores (because to) wearing nose chin, say wearing them.

I joined local CERT team years ago, followed advice instructor told us keep masks hand. I'm glad did, price single mask local CVS 1.99. think paid less 10 bucks box fifty surgical masks years ago. Yes. taught properly figure source credible accept anything agree factual not... little device pocket useless. People jump straight search engines instead going credible websites. amount misinformation available today makes critical thinking understanding figure trust important thing many people arent properly taught due lack funding. [Literally die guarantees debt there. must lived southern part state. mon county it’s definitely vilified. basically them.  ICU beds steady that's huge uptick hospitalizations. Nice source, wish states something like that. talking chinese science ? Please go back mom’s basement. honestly vaccine want first - want goddam therapeutics made save fucking lives meantime.

Even vaccine theres still chance adverse effects similar flu vaccine....i dont wanna go shit They're mad mire popular state is. many people walking around jeans saying “I can’t get used wearing mask?”

Like dude, pants made least comfortable fabric available yet you’re used it. Clearly get used anything. Average American doesn’t care deaths motivate change unless somebody close dies. Deaths affecting small percentage population, normal working population. That's exactly plan do. Get 12-month lease, knows, may even like living Portland full-time. making sure pick right neighborhood lifestyle (trail running, golf, basketball, indoor rock climbing, weed, craft beer). Take deserve you’re making living wage you’ll actual reason happy. Much cases traced Memorial Day Weekend, similar Florida. We'll see protest spikes another week two - seen many protests Texas sure we'll much spike due that. lockdown 

Fuck  Go freedumbs! unless they'd prefer visit funeral. 1. Great news! 2. N.L. mean? ICU numbers pretty flat [highest level since May Gross. indeed excellent time minimum. girlfriend wearing KN95 last night tried respirator thinks maybe could alright. Well yes, absolutely. However nominated elected actual moron truly horrible person. Anyone thought would get anything else Trump seriously deluded. PA worries went yellow zone it’s way early know reopening going affect numbers. I’ve noticing much higher increase traffic weekend long lines get retail stores opened. Hopefully saving grace far people wearing masks. I’ve sushi salads delivered. I’ve multiple people explain it’s possible get eating careful packaging. Well I’m AZ resident dropped truck repairs. entire shop acted like wasn’t epidemic happening. PPE (masks), social distancing, guy dropped back house mask worries riding shotgun.... don’t get it. Come arizona, come america something. Everybody. American president told you: ""don ask america you, ask country?"" minimize social contacts, wear masks, wash hands, stuff need do. grandparents got ww2 great loses life. Many away long time, many never came back sit time home? Come wartime, act like heroes need want, everybody you. American, never there, breaks heart see country suffer like this. depends common things dont seem common definitely early say anything conclusively. suspect initial spread hit lot vulnerable death rate reflected that. 

The disease much prevalent, infected population group lower mortality rate. 

The net result larger infected group dying lower rate fairly steady number deaths now. 

As lagging indicators catch up, infected group gets larger, anticipate increase number deaths median victim age plummets.  That's true. Carry then, curious. live low density area go running I'm never really proximity people, guess sharing trails lots people covering mouth makes sense. school drafting several different plans, one keep referencing one played event shut again.

It's going hell. schools reopen, become virus factories. Kids spread like wildfire families we're going another resurgence virus. district little faith going remain open entirety year honestly scary.

There's real contingency plan place. honest horrible truth we're ""Let's see happens react accordingly"" mode. lack major oversight honestly unacceptable. need sort plan place state level, one. Hahaha silly try lighting sage first cleansing properties

and also gets rid ghosts  times mass internet access everyone evidence palm hand. Anyone demanding spoonfed lazy, inept stupid formulate adequate search phrase even discussion first place. Thats pure fucking political hate right there. even bother FAA then? Right now, catching virus important respect airplane safety plane crashes. FAA prohibits airlines flying unsafe planes, need prevent operating manner that's unsafe respect coronavirus. Thank website. Unfortunately, looks like hand sanitizer still stock near me. able get small bottles, can't afford buy bulk, enough last couple weeks. also know set classroom. small room, usually 25-40 kids per class. There's way social distancing. really know do. live near FL see ton NY plates coming north. totally convinced ""just flu"" 

The CDC would agree.. flu, people 65 years older, current COVID-19 hospitalization rates similar observed comparable time points recent high severity influenza seasons.

 CDC Summary April 25, 2020

# Sweden could probably survive going 43% debt gdp without much problem, we? think spent way much already. dont think brutal lock affects mental health, see little reason such, free country becomes free.....

What hell do? shit everywhere.... That's HUGE remember antibody test sampling population 3% positive rate. Considering antibody tests tend lot false positive, actual number might less 3%. 300k might it, among half asymptomatic, leaving asymptomatic cases 150k. 60k reported far off. Probably many mild cased even get tested recover. governor, district district decision. worked 2 jobs whole life also. I've struggled idea do. fairly decent worked harder people, got lucky. got job dude retiring taught needed know. work company builds burners deices planes stayed open. wife ER nurse. got lucky. idea people going do. idea govt help people need it. screaming 3 months ago going mass evictions. horrifying. govt can't let happen Unless everyone wore mask held outside. yeah. Alabama Utah getting attention people fixate raw numbers jump page.

Texas 83 new cases per 1,000,000 77 one day....but Arkansas, Alabama, Utah, Florida, SC, NC, MS 100/1,000,000.

New York comparison 36 per million stage pandemic. Wear mask stand close people. Getting bad rural county No, flatten curve also get testing/tracing PPE needed be. That's sane countries like Germany did. that. really isn’t consider they’re starting from. Minimum wage workers already rent burdened financially pinched across country. Wages stagnant decades I’d bet Target’s CEO upper management see steady raises compensation. bare minimum placation try head increases labor class awareness efforts organize better pay benefits. Yal get 2021 say educated individuals, ""big city elites"". 

When say ""big city elites"", couple things come mind. Governor NY done admiral job. Governors three populated states union (Florida, Cali, Texas) failed miserably another prominent leader. 

When big city elites mentioned, many likely think Paris Hilton (or Elon Musk) Fauci. Trump built quite empire big city elite. Additionally roughly 80% US population live urban areas. 

What examples disdain ""big city elites""? I'm aware scientific finding dismissed big city bias. fact I'm aware recent research even coming NYC would consider impactful. Correct, mostly less populous areas. 

Source: small town Texas. would still rent year get know neighborhoods. ended area wouldn’t otherwise happy decision. Lived Bay Area 5 years tried couple cities ending PDX. weasels already trying get Well....except guy 49. head hurts trying understand everyone hates masks much.

Really they've brainwashed moronic pro-trump politicians created message trump wanted hear, piss trump. (or... maybe politicians genuinely believe trump too) .

They'd better pass immunity laws soon lawsuits come. 

Either way - politicians fucking morons. Similar observations. Mask/no-mask cuts demographics. say seems men wear less, what's new, gender exactly known risk aversion.

I find better need go buy perishables, go places strict rules responsible customer base. means avoiding Publix. USA CDC. contribute anything preventing coronavirus, though. know situation New Jersey, Colorado essentially began building CDC early march. we'd done week earlier, would saved thousand lives. national CDC done nothing state done nothing help state CDC (CDPHE + expert group) deal coronavirus. Yeah, shit; elected fucking climate change denier. wrong entire truth 👍 study makes sense me. Couldnt also assume doctors didnt end getting disease all. doesnt seem positive tests within study assumption worked people disease thst could it. actually test people tested positive antibodies. people around sick people never tested positive. confuse room staff take care many high risk patients. Covid real, I've going liquor store every day 2 months never got dang virus put context: standard percentage capacity operate?

Also, look cases date hospitalization. They're plummeting, skyrocketing. I'm NC hope Governor Cooper fights visit hard found RNC convention. RNC tried basically bully Cooper, saying would follow face mask distancing requirements, Cooper said ""lol GTFO here"" PC terms. states fighting right let citizens die RNC. 

Also, mistaken, AZ hit ICU overrun status?! 

This country nuckin' futs, man. Yeah 100% boat. I've heaps around garden that's plus. shame obese piece shit That's incredibly poor way looking this. 

It's spread people take seriously, spread people take seriously.

It's anti-vaxer. feeling man governor, talking response pandemic. answer full misinformation that’s based science. 

Vaccines WAY achieve herd immunity. Vaccinate enough people population disease can’t find enough kindling spread. That’s herd immunity. Sure, theoretically could work exposed contract covid, roughly 1% fatality rate, that’s whole lotta dead people. Coming virus doesn’t “prep” immune system virus. challenges immune system virus. Many people die approach. Many people experience long term ramifications severe complications virus. 

The reason don’t vaccine circulating coronaviruses like SARS SARS epidemic died vaccine could produced. quite literally cannot test vaccine disease circulating, funding development vaccine disappears. don’t vaccines commonly circulating coronaviruses aren’t deadly, account small percentage annual common colds. Vaccine development costly. There’s market development vaccine would make 15% less likely experience people winds seasonal annoyance. Heh. public health project, especially aggregation reporting? That’s unlikely. Even exist, it’s like always produce bug free code.

Most data aggregation systems really multiple systems multiple points aggregation, usually separate administrative control.

I’m shocked lot systems within order magnitude reality. Especially fresh data. Weekly monthly sums provide opportunities hand run cross-checks discover issues.  you’re seeing cheery picked bits blurbs. watched CNN every night week straight virus mentioned repeatedly. interviewing protesters virus, talking whether wearing masks talking local leaders virus concerns etc. Maybe narrative another network pushing simply isn’t true. massive hypocrites say trumps rally corona risk blm protests aren’t asshole accused psychopath.


No karma schill account many people today afford own. rural areas costs same, cities 3-4x much probably guess COVID-19 long term impacts COVID strains. fair assumption, I'd say. Unfortunately, Joe Arpaio running sheriff again. Exactly. first thought reading title: ""lol ya think?"" Karma always watching you..... might brief 3 months protection. hope he's ok.  Thankfully Sheriff Joe running again.

Green bologna pink underwear everyone mighty defensive response question. answer no, clarify intent comment move along. 

Additionally, different opinions inevitable. It’s 22 days without signs spike. Everything know virus suggests would able see difference now. got American. Well that’s well expected. Lol sorry friend, that’s gotta anxiety inducing. smart stay safe best can’t believe podcast news company held standard here. Anyone takes joe’s opinion anything isn’t comedy martial arts isn’t bright begin with

Joe people likes likes basically everyone going taxing small / medium businesses. Careful, New England mafia might roll insist NY isn’t theirs. rally held outside, indoors. Customized education expensive. bright side, classes taking, sounds like another year college that's really starts getting better. honestly doubt they're going bring kids back fall. colleges back, K-12 impossible social distance.  mask kind better mask... go ahead infect people. I've taken days work last months, felt like maybe coming something, case. yet. protests every single state. Boooo hoooooooo RIP You’re delusional. Yes also new data coming showing possible long term damage body regardless symptoms shown not. Even though deaths (now especially dexamethasone) many suffer long term maybe permanent lung/ respiratory damage. young seems absolutely ""out clear"" scenario even catch it. worst thing it’s mild case? Explain also low IQ detector. commend still Facebook lol, couldn’t even imagine crap show right now. I’m honestly hoping find online forum base that’s like, COVID support groups people like us generally concerned able vent speak minds frustrating experience. swear God feels like I’m taking crazy pills headlines see often, that’s also eye opening hear/see governor...unreal. 

Stay strong, stay safe ever need someone vent feel free DM me. live northeast remember unreal anxiety back Feb/March first started exploding us. one job 😐 unemployment follow... know people getting covid today gotten covid without lockdown? every us news met ""fuck China"" :) Couldn’t protests? mean? since SWA newer airline many pensioners it? Russia influencing elections. people dying send cheap goods China. Iran calling human rights abuses. Next Guatemala's going start civil war leaves United States pieces. Maybe Africa draw new borders. Poor guy. 98% chance he'll survive :( Type gang here. 

Sound off! even close said.  like Flagstaff; nice weather except winter. I’m asking anyone wants stay home come outside. take issue amount people advocating freedoms taken away. think it’s incredibly selfish plenty options people protect themselves. Maybe.

I'm definitely 2/3, make, maybe, two trips house per week (yay working home).

The people 1/3? They're back living life usual, they're whatever.

So twice many us total, we're likely see members 1/3 2/3 outside. produce antibodies, antibodies confer indefinite protection. Yes, Pritzker sucks. Yeah live 😒 number hear 0.5% 1% cases (including estimated asymptomatics). Obviously, factors like age, pre-existing health conditions, viral load, lack treatment could alter infected individual's risk death well double digits. Florida, Texass, AZ, Alabama, Utah, NC...hmmm common? Yup overflow patients got surgeries delayed “first wave” stay way though? Everyone stores maybe. corporate people, district leadership teams, etc really front line. Anyone working home isnt either. I'm sorry, please educate how's wrong. (I genuinely know.) AZ population: 7.29M. 
Covid tested positive: 41K.  

7.29M : 41K = 177 : 1

Different rounding yield 175

Now, admittedly positive might include non-residents population might not, would still ballpark. fucking idiot! Beach Grim Reaper really inconsistent idiot.

Good know. Don’t start planning [insert here] yet. Dr. Anthony Fauci gave dire news [about it]

Crying wolf. think difference here. antibodies blood mean immunity retained. 

Early tests indicate immunity may stored T-cells far longer antibodies remain blood. Californian, what's taking long? heard innefective High Risk Cases, Works mild cases anyone know and/or taken at-home LabCorp Covid19 swab test? see accuracy rate anywhere. curve absolutely rising look statistics actually matter hospitalizations deaths, trending since April. Donald Trump, fundamental mistrust CDC get health guidance instead. shame president mistrusting authoritative scientific figure parrot narrative. California, 102 years ago wearing mask meant 10 days jail. Yup, I'm concerned hospitalizations point. dont, scared me. Im scared servers forced around people day least likely people taken precautions. Get ready Karen's suddenly medical conditions preventing wearing mask. Well, fact continue avoiding topic *is* deciding factor can't take seriously. frequent spelling mistakes also makes come flustered, helping. sorry you’re put terrible position want help people. Wish best.

Man country sucks! night clubs pool clubs open restrictions looked make sure. briefing Cuomo April, said 24.7% people NYC antibodies. later briefing, changed 19.9%. I've heard antibody test super accurate right now, think saying anywhere 20-25 suggesting NYC reduced active cases 0 open up?

?? ever suggest that? First, one needs reduce caseload 0 order open up. fundamental misunderstanding lockdown even for, seems. needed lock overload hospital system, considering NY state testing 1% positive employed thousands contact tracers, decent shape begin reopening slowly. phasing businesses progressing next phase certain metrics met.

The OP specify either rural hard-hit places lmao. large city US, second wave definition fewer potential people infect. Reopening slowly nowhere near free-for-all virus early March. problem many states like Florida reopening everything willy nilly without putting measures place keep virus check. Reopening itself, done guidance public health experts, doesn’t bad thing. Look South Korea. Except often said basement blogger doesnt claim phd. large following. would probably make feel bold. sign says something like ""trans women real women"" they'd put mask fast 😎

gotta psychologize good though, encourage people follow basic social expectation. Well can't discuss politics sub support wrong side sooooooooo.......

I'll hust enjoy echo chamber. 

Hopefully I'll taking back amount redditors support borders. high hopes though.

Not even full minute already downvote hehe can’t control millions people taking streets. supposed say. Guys stay home? worked well quarantine...

What stand important decade defining. isn’t really controllable

It matter “well going anyway” imo. tens thousands peacefully protesting individual cities proof serious aspirations make big thing 5th grade science disprove existance God? think Microcenter good job well. checked using phone came text you, crowds inside whatsoever. Someone would give mask entry another person would spray hands down. Take guess people trust governments mainstream media. That's hospitalizations. Divide number ICU county population. OC 3.2M, LA 10M. Come 46 41 per M.

Also note LA trending somewhat hospitalizations many counties increasing, including OC. Well they’re surgery it’s keep sneezes excretions open body, extremely vulnerable. it’s doctors office well check idea. I’ve never doctor wear mask examining talking me… actual science? I’d willing look it. especially like see study showing masks help social settings… It’s one thing mask help close quarters, doctors office -face face - beach? restaurant? Walking street?  would love see science coronaviruses see examples short term immunity What's opinion Chinese study found cells recovered patients largely inefficient eliminating virus infected cells? Appearantly MHC l elimination. affect memory cells? Well fuckin shit.
Idiots worried idea kids autistic dead. Daily deaths steadily declining since April continue so. 

Now give broken record response: ""two weeks, two weeks, two weeks, two weeks"" I've hearing since Georgia opened two months ago family member took kids San Diego week. within 24 hours coming back visited parents high risk age group. 

But believes virus released bill Gates make money, wasn’t deadly enough that’s investing vaccine, kill us purpose. raiki prevent virus killing you. 

I’m truly worried us. takes small percent population act carelessly kill bunch people made smart choices... really, fantasy world live actually ever happened, seriously?

Wake friend, message always controlled. Las Vegas open? people told us wear masks social distance would stop promoting protests political. One day say stay home could kill someone next day encourage people gather protest. Pure hypocrisy. Within enforcement, nothing. go... vast majority medical workers wear shit 6-10 hours day complaint despite discomfort.

 


Fuck put fucking mask on. they’re wonderful rural hospitals maybe two three icu beds most! glad hear that, considering stoping worried this. default go public places first thing morning everyone else alseep avoid them, microcenter doesnt hours would enable that. Houston seriously needs enforce masks. teach dude ;) Yes! grew Garden Grove. stereotype us all.  Thanks, Captain Obvious. Tell trumpettes. outside, Americans dumb - seems sets America apart, unshakable conviction personal freedoms important tenet civilization, even expense society whole. 

There's sense wanting told do, even would make life demonstrably better yourself, others around America's problem less freedoms, considering Canada, Australia, lot Europe free able flatten curves. problem moreso intelligence average American. even know say. fucking worse Idiocracy. Fucking moron. Producing risk. vaccine approved, it'll allow UK almost immediately start distributing vaccine start process strangling COVID UK all. think comes population density. spread like wildfire major cities people cautious. rural areas like Centre County, people may heard friend friend someone knew someone got (177 cases pop near 200K) don’t see fuss. people would agree congregating indoors main reason.

Once again, say that??? reference adobe do? tendency bring tangential information makes difficult understand point (especially include link). I'm going start commuting work coming weeks (public transportation). particular types protective wear look purchase order keep safest?

I know masks gloves helpful, particular types look for? time someone dies becomes sick return work lose experience knowledge. Sometimes lose decades it. bring people replace them, could take years get productivity back was, mention 120,000+ dead Americans family members loved ones, many workers, grieving productive time well. Even give shit human suffering loss life purely concerned economic impact, letting virus spread like wildfire infecting many people possible terrible idea. Pretending pandemic everything back normal 

Huh? 3 things mentioned article akin pretending pandemic over? benign things grand scheme pandemic. 

I guarantee person running sample stand masked gloved. grabbing sample choose so. different driving starbucks getting takeout food. already mentioned things Target quell concerns surface transmission -- they're simple, easily doable things. Kroger operating normal hours entire non-issue. People frequenting grocery stores every single day since beginning pandemic. time think maxes 120mins. think sell nights get much worse that. got email yesterday leave state all, plan take two weeks vacation quarantined work. think it’s great. co-workers, much. state 6 cases yesterday alone tied families returning Myrtle. least social media, 50 friends family members Myrtle Beach Florida last week entire families. It’s going dark summer. agreeing me, trying make sound like disagree. Nice! make liar? Move on. Took long enough, Turner dragged feet forever made conflicting statements. virus dies 2-4 days surfaces, would N95 masks ""reusable"" 6, wore 1 day? time get back 1st one, ""sterile"" again. Yeah, that's essentially problem. federal CDC, state would already CDC. also would legally allowed create tests. Instead state started building CDC early mid-march, legally allowed use tests CDC ones (of zero) late march. is, essentially, give month economy. build fifty different CDCs fifty different testing supply chains scratch deal problem, took time.

We would better last six months federal government. is, course, federal government's goal. natural selection stupidity negatively affects making stupid decisions

Quick edit: concede still natural selection. Unfortunately, natural selection affects populations species whole. So, may evolving make better decisions, instead may selected entire species, stupid average, survive pandemic. person wearing N95 mask, make difference. Frankly, I'd wearing situation like that. know kind mask person choosing wear. 

And well aware cloth/non-N95 masks stop getting disease, hindering spread. work major hospital system, drilled heads, even though front line. one even implying scenario would asked wear masks rest life. mouth breather mean project onto everyone else. think muzzle tight, sound like someone ODing CO2 need wear masks street

Yeah, no, should. Walking street New York bring close proximity potentially hundreds strangers. understand think special streets eliminate viral transmission. Agree said except Fauci ain’t infallible either. actually headed beach Florida week. hotel kitchen, eat never bars kids. wear masks wash hands, I’m overly concerned. It’s assault battery Massachusetts. pretty much every state. People: think yourself, think others. wear mask clear benefit you, others could benefit. Protect vulnerable. mask flag shows much care others. least corporations understand compared who? Mask usage needs enforced via fines. know sounds extreme wearing mask literally effortless way prevent spreading COVID. wouldn’t like people jailed going work, don’t want wear mask fine, get help local/state/federal government pay COVID response.  doctors nurses them?  Please check reasons [FILL COUNTRY NAME HERE]'s successful Coronavirus response ignored Americans:

[X] island!

[X] population tiny!

[X] would anyone travel there? Nobody even heard country!

[ ] Asians inscrutable!

[X] like, spread out!

[X] much richer America!

[ ] much poorer America!

[X] cold Coronavirus spread!

[ ] hot Coronavirus spread!

[ ] __________________________ (Insert self serving reason). everyone wore masks? drop infection rates justify it.

Um ... never happened.  Hence current predicament.

And since people INFECTED know it... yes, that's everyone wear mask. keeps infecting others keeps infecting others. Go assumption everyone infected.  can't grasp wearing mask keeps someone's droplets cough traveling far wide unknown me. Lawd. 

And whole point every thing put way infection helps. Standing six feet away someone ... reduces chance transmission xx%.  Wearing mask? reduces chance transmission xx%. TOGETHER?  reaaallllly goes down. many assholes meant say Two thousand percent agree. Family states get worried us Florida see pictures beach. I’m pregnant go beach, tell you, it’s easy maintain least 20 feet another person choose. honestly never felt unsafe. 
Now, want go middle Clearwater beach hotels plop next several large groups people, that’s dumb honestly rude. Happens restaurants too... won’t let walk without mask on, yet sit eat without one...

It makes ZERO sense.

You mean tell need mask seated, I’m seated don’t need anymore? I’m going next weekend, overly concerned it.

As long take necessary steps manage risk fine. Wish would stop 20 year age groupings.  Truly breaking headlines

Oh wait, February? opinion lot reasons agree ""...but half us won’t, we’ll another 8 months, many people get sick die.""

I wonder makes author think end 8 months. bit course quite correct. 120k now.

 Google it. dies heat... can't know test. Gotta keep numbers up. Bad link. often wondered there's conversation interstate travel affecting spread. Especially bordering states becoming hot zones. I'm waiting time certain states begin enforce border restrictions others don't, everyone loses minds. I'm trying see people react say, lucky pick. see, view people sub mindless sheep universally believe every word media says, playing sheep fun sometimes. no, make troll, makes average person reddit. people ""argue"" reddit really angry, they're giving something laugh at. case, I'm laughing sheepish are.

I admit daily cases decreasing nearly rate since mid- April, they've ever slightly decreasing less less, necessarily mean it'll go back 30K day. slight increase daily cases past week could like ""wave"" late April, definitely recent lack social distancing mask-wearing, case, daily cases would've started go ""up"" much sooner now.

Also, experts? Really? ""experts"" speak even medical degrees. Hell, Tedros even medical degree!

Well, I'll say fun lasted, guess. “One thing realize matter dream (hoax) not. Survival depends do, think.”

edit: hoax employee preschool municipality Skaraborg went work despite person found covid 19 infected. Now, police notified kicked time immediate effect job. ""We made aware preschool employee deliberately gone work established infection, criminal act,"" HR manager municipality said press release.

I can't believe low level hypocrisy.    
Exactly foresaw, authorities blaming citizens bad decisions.    
Who said [no reason close insisted children main driver contagion? threat parents [cutting social send kids school? make teachers scared fired [wear refuse communicate [information decided necessary test students school [1 teacher     
Enough! testing. Hospitalization steady. it'll keep getting worse people like ""middle class"". family lived around $20-$30 thousand per year less. We've homeless know survive little bit money. never hit hardest. middle class chipped thrown ladder suffer to. Hey wanted know can’t say “intelligence” expect anything happen So, Trump catch COVID 19 them, give them, silent spreader? hearing today local university plan forcing students use them, plan campaign get people use force them. get many scared make official requirement. I'm sure better, use mask. I'm glad staying safe countries coming lockdown. means - without vaccine without virus eliminated - facing virus way Sweden done. 

So - managed tens thousands people die C-19, better hoping things work Swedes, otherwise we're fucked. 

So yeah, competition, I'm rooting Swedes. 

The question - everyone else? can't Sweden. Take slow. publicity stunt faith government could actually make happen, perhaps...

The Government buys supplies, outbids local hospitals/governments, says ""No... national stockpiles, states use."" Science? could never happen here. think know exactly doing. part reason people exist. taking advantage every chance gets. you’re saying it’s like flu? /s Coronavirus Enjoy summer mask!! Fair point, wasn’t clear. 20 somethings know roommates also 20s. may live parents doubt it’s majority. Honestly - throw rally outside mostly young people wouldn’t worry much. two situations aren’t similar. I’m wrong, celebrate. That’s WW2. WW1 Russia lost “only” 2 million soldiers. stupid strong one... There's blind guardian Spain? live insane world. I'm torn rally. one hand, wish terrible disease anyone. hand, maybe massive outbreak among families takes get point across people denying seriousness situation. 

Right now, seems people catastrophe happening remote big cities far away. They're concerned happening places people. Maybe losing neighbor relative takes. really wish come that. bad disease, wrong hope someone gets it. I'm stuck. foreign workers mostly young healthy people ripping population would make sense deaths really low. That's beautiful!

Yeah sources include John Hopkins too. Know tons coronavirus trackers providing tons data. That's thought people may feel oversaturated want know things getting better not. That's app gives priority cases per million inhabitants. Yeah think least meet mark (unless various agencies cover numbers) “Now tell me”

/s much like free samples CostCo, hell no. Nope. I’m good. back January read website, sort suggested 19th century remedies ( pandemics much radar suppose) one things opening windows letting fresh air.

that said...its air conditioning. lack mask wearing. feel great indoors building open windows. People acting pandemic's almost over, U.S. states either middle still starting. Looking Florida highest ever new case rate.  Tough guy alert idea right now. That's pretty much Florida survives Biology check Bro...lol

Feel free form opinions world around clips social media, I'll stick science.

Imagine anti mask crusader Reddit holy shit lol Sure. existence air conditioning, plus opening malls, restaurants, etc, plus hot weather. amounts people south high levels people indoors recirculating air.

Add political resistance wearing mask distance, get current map new cases. Come Texas.
Abutt said plenty ICU beds everyone. **Google translate**

Denmark opens borders certain Swedes. People Skåne, Sörmland Västerbotten well Halland Blekinge travel country June 27, states Danish Ministry Foreign Affairs.


The new travel rules, apply June 27, based criteria number infected, EU countries UK covered.


For country go green light accordance Danish rules, number infected persons per 100,000 inhabitants must maximum 20 per week. figure exceeds 30 infected per week, country instead classified so-called ""quarantine country"", according Danish model.
Valued region region.


However, Nordic countries meet requirements, Danish model offers exceptions ""quarantine countries"", Sweden, instead assessed basis spread infection different regions.


- case, open entry regions country meet criteria number infected, Foreign Ministry writes press release.


For Sweden, means show live either Skåne, Västerbotten Sörmland get green light travel Denmark, provided also show intend stay least 6 nights country.


Residents border area ​​the Öresund region, ie Skåne, Halland Blekinge, also get green light enter Denmark contagion criteria met. infection situation regions change worse, scans, hallways bleachers want enter Denmark must also able show negative corona test maximum 72 hours old.


The rules also apply housing German border area Schleswig-Holstein, south Denmark.


At moment, Danish police discussing Swedes certify region from.


""We ready model June 27, police decide certify regional affiliation,"" says Christina Raabæk, spokesperson Danish Ministry Justice.

The title previously been: ""Denmark opens border Swedes"" ""Denmark opens border Scania"". chose recent one seen moment writing svt.se next mask confiscation? brutal countries, still brutal.

Forcing industries destroyed businesses destroyed jobs houses lost banks got bailed out

Will cause health crisis

Closing community centres, resources vulnerable society like abused woman.

In Canada, social services restricted adults disabilites day programs restricted go even residential settings. Closing city services facilities

Its causing massive increases overdoses, missing cases, overall increase incident reports hate sound like old man responsibility , whether person social maintains freedom. Behavior changes drastically temperatures go 100 Arizona.

Well, yeah, 1/4 population goes back home state summer. I’d love see policy justification this. Good. COVID-19 old news. important things deal like abolishing racist police. Saw article earlier morning. understand thinking, governor wants strongly encourage everyone wear mask, doesn’t want prohibit people access government services don’t wear mask. 

Regardless thought process intentions, still think he’s idiot Nebraskan hate guts. He’s certified dumbass. California resident here. Mask compliance really high last months. mandatory order get grocery stores quite while. mandatory state order would formality, seen Bay Area. therefore instead using anecdotes stories *prove* virus long-term negative health effects people get even mild cases it? understand time takes get long-term observations effects - that's understand people sub others saying virus poses significant long term risk young mild cases truth *we know*, cherry-picked, anecdotal stories needlessly scare people.  [This claims O-type blood almost 50% less likely severe infection.

I'm still going play safe fuck, I'm idiot. feel ever slightly better. end May. want say around May 28th. Believe me, I've trying. education little background Microsoft Office Bookkeeping. jobs tend want lot experience minimum wage though. ridiculous. apply anyway, meh.

The retail jobs pretty much issues: Call-ins, short-staffing, garbage bosses.. get wrong, I've good bosses, they're far between. - along docked pay cases, painful PPE even it,  risk family members, emotional trauma seeing people dying way help them, told speak lack PPE ventilators whole said patients dying. I’m sure there’s several friends family members work healthcare ones I’ve heard. US not. many cultural/political/legal obstacles, complete lack federal leadership right now. Maybe couple smarter governors adopt something like it, looks like we're basically letting thing happen. You’re absolutely right. without 15 people, wouldn’t spread. initial branch infected people paramount spread. see evidence today...now 23 days first protests...that initial batch people infected. argument though 15 knew, less two weeks infected, infected. would take THREE weeks see protesters testing positive. Iceland 9 people per square miles.. talk isolation. test rate continues trend downward, unlike TX, AZ FL. OC resident here! We've still got lot people wear masks take seriously, that's thing. Also, amount people friend/acquaintance circle lots small gatherings different friend groups (as observe via FB) keeps growing growing. Kids gather hang ride bikes together neighborhood. many said, people seem bored virus personally affected. crazy. wear mask social distance, people! already involuntarily joined google/api contact tracing. released contact tracing API apps, phone OS updates.  I'm sure want Sweden seen failure want officials admit failed, spend extraordinary amount time trying prove *have* failed.

Are really desperate seen right? 

I imagine joy would Sweden actually actually fail, giving opportunity say ""I told so"".

Sweden's strategy - success failures - bit worse others terms mortality rates, bit better others terms reducing harm brought destructive measures. admit stop playing petty little pissing contest nobody really gives fuck about? like Yang, he’s smart guy willing take fresh look modern problems. think right drop hope see him. Sure, Bill Burr list comic. Elon Musk list whatever(inventor/tech figure). guests B-D list, trying watch 30 mins brutal. Maybe list topics times bottom skip things want hear about. Otherwise, I'm done topic, tune out. mean unless hardcore technical jui jitsu fan, see guests forcing switch shows worry. experience teeny, face-loving, native flies, swarms military-grade march-flies, fat, maggot-filled medusa-flies, named time kill one there's two dive-bombing face, befriend every spider come across. 17 hospiatals, 2 reporting full ICU capacity. Apparently spokesperson one saying ""plenty beds available"" However, Alan Poston, spokesperson Wellington Regional Medical Center, disputed numbers, saying hospital ""plenty beds."" 

 average 78%. figures average pandemic? Otherwise I've 0 idea make number. I’m gonna call 800k dead overish three years. we’re gonna talk stuff over. Masks , what’s safe what’s not. even real. epic fucking joke. Well, including antibody tests number, probably. think also due overall macro economic factors playing well, social policies stem bleeding. example, Norway much dependent oil, given turmoil oil markets, inevitable get hit pretty hard.. 

Sweden though, dug grave makes sense got hit hard.. never , kansas px , im philly, target worst go amazon dont country stupid. countries virus control started wearing masks since day 1. 5 months pandemic still talking whether wear wear masks. Fuck country. Air conditioned buildings also don’t open windows. Places Indonesia open air buildings vehicles markets done much better job controlling this. source comes owing business increase salary + overheads definitely hurts matter see it. Paris crushed curve without help. doable without too.

Calm fuck down. heaters winter? Joe Rogan much like DJT sense example dumb person's idea smart man, except Joe's case moron fanbase mistakes fact ""asks questions"" sign intelligence. Anyone ever told ""There dumb questions"" fucking liar idiot. idiotic questions lack applicable context critical thought. people delusional man. global data point still ignore it. **The vast majority people contract covid19 experience mild symptoms.** literal, objective, indisputable fact. virus potential fuck somebody up, overwhelmingly not. users fucking cheerleaders disinformation. recovery rate estimated 97-99.75%, treated like black plague here. know, right? NYC resident, voluntary isolating nothing prevented going outside. said that, tons people live since day 1. Even delivery people wearing masks. fly Wuhan. Classic tactic deferring responsibility. OP come alternative lying. That's public health communicators. That's job. Good reference. 👍 was, claim, time, able point post defended anything anyone whatsoever. work office US. There's penalty. 

I'm talking specific situation talking hypothetical.

These people care sharing disease. care keeping sick days retire slightly earlier. Narrator: ""It wasn't"" Thank you. feeling like idiot... Take ny state nyc example. locked march 20th. everyone followed suggestions wear mask stay inside still (not all, obviously, majority people) nyc entering phase 2 reopening. Upstate entering phase 3 places! We're testing 60k people day, 1% infection rate now. 15 people dying day peak 800 (EIGHT HUNDRED DAY). 

Hell, thousands people marched BLM city across state - MASKS- even though social distancing really option, infection rate even peak! continuing go down! 

If every state slowed fuck down, stopped insane, could reopening right extreme risk.

But no. Instead people jerking selves right wear mask private business shit. i’ve seen people provinces discuss border control strict, honestly think best is. least point, anyway. recent new case three weeks ago travel, i’m glad they’ve decided keep province less recreational travel lockdown. can’t complain they’ve handled things! Make wear mask eat lead. La Mesa checking in. 20% mask usage love near cowles mountain packed now. probably misunderstood point. gave mixture percentages absolute numbers (wrong ones), thought point OC lot cases relative population."
