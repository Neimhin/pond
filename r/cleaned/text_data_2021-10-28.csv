Remember trump trying downplay bad virus numbers U.S? Remember Bolsonaro Brazil? Remember every authoritarian regime always kind thing? Putin? CCP?

I really understand controversial opinion.  Okay, gonna go look successful democratic socialist countries.....wait, exist lol. 

And no, Sweden socialist. social democracy, there's difference. Socialism government (Typically dictatorship proletariat) owns means production, social democracy simply big social safety net funded usually heavy taxes. 10% guys net worth 10 years 48k 48k reached 10 years?  yup enough case China one 100% compliant. Happy now?    go hospital without taking mortgage enjoy one world's best health care system though probably reason 100% eligible people getting vaccinated. stop butthurt now. start. Depending jealous Cubans better health care system you.  endemic disease still know effects of.  
Our govts nations mostly elected ignore pursuit capitalism. They, elected leadership roles, abandoned citizens workers die. parents die. children...to die. 
Yet still, are, altogether right here, watching happen. commenting could tell difference. Cuba renowned unmatched health care system. obviously comments trying make fun 100% stem SOcIaLisM bad    population counted year country? thought places like US every four years (""the census""). No, left!!! Packed country got town üòÇüòÇüòÇ this, adverse effect study ants? needs least‚Ä¶three times big.

Zoolander aside, think FDA made right call allowing parents vaccinate children, convinced FDA truly proven beyond reasonable doubt parents *should* vaccinate. Adverse events rare twelve year old people generally, whether Covid vaccine it.

If reading this, age 18, get damn vaccine. doubt should.  im 'shooting' anyone.

Then 100% means could say 100.0% mean 100.00% mean saying ""100%"" mean literally everyone without rounding. previous point made? shit, lock many people. I‚Äôd never defend throwing drug users dealers jail.

Cuba claim 100% vaccine rate literacy, I‚Äôll call bullshit. like would country claiming same, like would morons claiming America best country world.

One nothing other.  reality far lower. Half American population read fifth grade level. Even majority college graduates read book past year.  actually mean fit **testing** simple fit **checking**?  says something else equally relevant.

But like shooting messenger, you? Sorry, literally believe illiterate people Cuba joking?  Well, definitely good time USA start shedding military budget.  So, Cuba nearly lifetime leader good then? 3 months problems coming it. However, it, pure hell. Muscle cramps lack libido. Plus, facial skin scaly damaged. sure vessel docks Cuban port can‚Äôt use American ports 180 days. US highest incarceration rate world. French governement said roughly time. perfect protection

That's weird argument: course one expect **perfect** protection (unless, perhaps, one wearing PAPR fit-tested N100): using local Sputnik vaccine there. first approved covid vaccine public world wide. Nothing wrong that.

But releasing vaccine month trials 80 people can't convince much people vaccine good. probably plays role distrust.   quite certain message ""we supply masks everyone use time, please use masks save supplies medical staff build supply""

That *should been* message, instead ""it's beneficial except clinical settings""  really bad math really think ""a single random eligible person [...] vaccinated"" country 11+ million people would bring vaccination rate 100% 99.9%. prescribed medicine concussion first couple nights it, penis went back inside body. weird. finally stopped taking it, penis constant erect. stuff poison   Currently cymbalta, tired sleep. feel you. authoritarian government actually make easier, harder, implement whatever health measure government fancies. See : asian countries handling covid situation. 
Here Morocco, literal tanks streets, enforce first lockdown. 9pm curfew weeks ago. Thanks amelioration epidemiological situation (less 10 deaths per day), curfew pushed back 11pm.  


Cuba ""strong"" government, imply anything health system. could gone either way. happens take public health seriously (see : cuban handling HIV compared rest world). like *inside* head? got headache 2 days first shot week. top front head put hand something crazy stressful happens So, gotten assaulting teenager? company already higher health insurance premium unvaccinated employees. biggest cancer breakthrough last 40 years came Cuba. form immune activation.

 Btw Calixto Garcia hospital, biggest hospital capital. father died forgot give insulin 2 days surgery.

Quite contrary, get fully paid days ill. disadvantages seeing doctor. Worst case, wasted hours get told shouting much yesterday's football match. 

Thus people Europe readily access cheaper health care (actually almost zero cost), seek much earlier. gives huge advantage treating diseases cause large amount complications, like Covid does. noted many times past decades, became clear medical treatment US consistently got worse outcomes would get elsewhere world. US worse health care providers, people seek help later, often cannot afford treatments require. Bullshit. Well must Magneto   Injection gator bite.  article says 96.4% ‚Äúat least partially vaxxed‚Äù, goes note Air Force isn‚Äôt saying many *fully* vaxxed.  Thank god way good sign, guess?

It means people **want** get vaccinated, **are** vaccinated, leaving people refuse shot unvaxxed.

Other countries can't get enough vaccines want them.  tend inflate publicly facing numbers.

This important information anyone remember whenever checking statistics. source information needs valid information itself. Blindly going ""they said so, must true"" ignorant many issues. Could 100% close enough people vaccinated? Sure could. However, vein North Korea could say exact too, would believe them?

That's Forsaken trying warn people about. need asshole it. UK gets added everyone's red list. Hell, I'm surprised UK got red list. lost ""eligible"". Nice try, tho. shorter among vaccinated people.

Really? never considered Big Bird male.   misleading so, comment good example. can't take unreviewed preprint, correct one huge error known, pretend real result even though still unreviewed may well flaws.

It also lacks important context. example, 1 26,315 people got vaccinated got myocarditis, also 1 31,500 people get vaccinated got myocarditis - mean actual risk vaccination? statistically significant all?

And there's fact observational study, random controlled trial. order numbers even meaningful, adjust possible correlated factors vaccinated unvaccinated set people. came set adjustments shows actually, incidence myocarditis among vaccinated people *lower* among unvaccinated people? hand, correlating factors chose adjusted by, huge gaping flaw reviewers catch?

Tonga last year  missing part though. business business US Cuba sanctioned. 

This form coercion control Cuban people. entire world sees unjust. issue still remains safety actual vaccine. apples oranges comparison honestly, they're weighing risk hospitalization/ICU/death thru covid vs hospitalization/ICU thru myocarditis.

The major thing accounted long term complications due contracting COVID. constantly compare immediate effects hospitalization/ICU stays, consider myocarditis result vaccinations overwhelmingly clear completely, vs worse outcomes via COVID pretty decent chance long term issues one way another.

I mean, kind see comes -- medical system's handling treatment chronic diseases conditions nothing short piss poor.  I'd want compare people ventilators reasons covid. Delta Airlines charges $200 month premium freedom COVID vaccination shot

And know number nowhere go up.   India's response seemed beat poor people truncheons would flee back home villages. suck US...because, know, (fake) freedom. like fuck ourselves. Ok?  Interesting time period,(As article referring to) normal year (No pandemic / Covid) number deaths worldwide, car wrecks, suicides, murders, old age, health issues, wars etc. less 5 million? Adding this, know people claim covid deaths ""inflated"" people counting things like car accidents, etc. (key word, claim) actually feel like look numbers, too. look number people catastrophic accidents, heart attacks, cancer treatment pushed back, things needed medical attention delayed, truly another scale. new idea, I'm sure history books going analyzing effects covid deaths, incidental deaths related strain healthcare too. overwhelmingly sad.

Yeah kidding. parents vaccine hesitant kids I'm ok with, long stop everyone else badly need protect kids family.

Want wait data? Cool, wait sidelines, always masked up, weekly daily testing. evidence pointing vaccinated less infectious, shown comprehensive peer-reviewed studies yet afaik.

I guess really agree standard, defining peer-review narrow way believe one example study--and others--that think give substantial weight.

I also note people sharing article--and part linked Twitter--are bona fide experts cited *thousands times* covid related work. words, precisely peers review journals. glaring flaws, experts would caught them.

I think need wait long, slow publication process reach tentative conclusions things, already multiple pre-prints people peer reviewing see problems with.

I've published bunch papers myself. publication process really, really slow, lot back-and-forth referees relatively minor points, anything change major conclusions. effect vaccine hospitalizations mortality Cuba? That‚Äôs lot deaths 20 months. Maybe start Go Fund like Herman Caine awardees do.  sort activities could done policies put place could prevented much this.

I already got Covid, room full infected, I‚Äôd walk right in. got again, would nothing. remember seeing good estimates China year ago, put 800,000 cases instead 80,000 (now 100k) 42,000 deaths instead 4,600

Considering pandemic China basically ended April 2020 figures make sense, certainly absurd estimates millions millions deaths someone could (rightly) hate government...

The FDA doesn‚Äôt actually make recommendations. FDA basically said vaccine safe 5-11 year olds. 

The CDC ACIP meet next week discuss whether 5-11 year olds actually *should* get vaccine. It‚Äôs possible might recommend kids underlying conditions get it, similar JCVI. case would right, none control citizens good communist countries. Got booster today.

**How long take Moderna booster take effect? effective immediately?**

I got J&amp;J March got Moderna booster morning (I heard effective). long *booster* take take effect (in someone already previously 'fully vaccinated')?

I'm asking I'm considering attending public even tomorrow large crowds people: masks enforced vaccinations ""encouraged."" Moderna booster morning grant additional protection early tomorrow? I'm weight whether attend.

Thanks advance! No, remember making claim, show did? Honestly though point CDC done pretty bad job. trust FDAs assessment kids way cdc. 

The CDC boosters kind proof that. FDA way positive towards needed be. true. US literally can't sending navy surround island. Show US blocking Cuba's ports. Show US preventing Canadian tourists going Cuba holiday winter. Show Cuban exports blocked South America Europe, imports countries blocked Cuba. 

The US embargo affects blocks trade US Cuba, US power stop country trading Cuba matter much want to. way US could actually impose blockade, distinct embargo literally cuts country trade countries generally military force.

Norway's regulators took third approach different FDA JCVI -- one dose ""for now"" rather two.

IMHO Pfizer/Moderna running trials lower dose levels longer intervals 12-25 thereabouts see get adequate immunity fewer cases myocarditis. would huge trial generate clear signal given observed myocarditis rates. George Washington mandated vaccines troops. Vaccine mandates around long time. Consciencious objection probably closest.  study shows previous infection vaccination high effectiveness. significant caveats. study;

""They also note study designed compare two groupswith two different types immunity-- immunity natural infectionversus immunity vaccination -- possible mixups. Plus, included hospitalized patients study, sothe findings may apply everyone.""

Also, average time infection test unvaccinated longer average time vaccination test comparison. know, vaccination natural immunicty, effectiveness fades time.

Furthermore, can't account number vaccinated previous undocumented infections.  Seems like disobeying orders me. house arrest, like governments Galileo, Copernicus, heretics. Seems solve two problems once.

2) remove dangerous people entertain conspiratorial ideas, actually ACT them. 

This complicated. it. Even accept everything YouTube media debunker guy asserts Cuban population protests, much tie point I'm making. ironic, I'm talking media making undue leaps divorced objective facts.

Did blockade include covax?
Was commonly framed did?

Yes/no suffices.

If joining thread far argue merits Cuba's communist rule apart that, I'm interested going topic.

If think nature protests meant vaccination access big deal Cubans time, I'm sure even starting point.  Lots apparently contradictory data question.

Whereas know people who've vaccine *no* issues right now. Assuming experience life-threatening allergic reaction shot, they're fine.

Where live it‚Äôs optional technically probably 95% adherence public indoor spaces. There's probably high correlation active covid cases strain medical resources. I'd less living pre-covid medical resources stretched, that's pretty much Delta surge. Problem mask mandates dropping. Well hasn‚Äôt yet. state legislature investigating overreach AG. (They staunch republicans se goes). special council nothing happened yet. 

The hospital sent notice staff basically saying shouldnt talk media without PR person right harassed/threatened etc. basically encouraged call security sign issue, hang heckled phone etc. report incidents.

How‚Äôs Iran pandemic? live sticks I'm used arriving timely fashion I've planned accordingly. Florida says "" Hold beer. get number back up"" operative words ""insufficient start infection"". That's scenario. immunity (from real infection) last long coronaviruses general.

This true, would expect waning antibody levels happen either natural vaccination immunity. However, there's still strong memory cell presence coronaviruses. issue coronaviruses flu viruses infect relatively quickly (2-4 days average) memory cell response play catchup, overall odds getting severe disease drop dramatically still memory immunity. It'll get top infection much faster.  5% 20% 1%. Move decimal places apply discount self-reported bullshit right track.  fat burger longer really around. idea source correct.

But even 1.6 billion doses month lot. That's first dose everyone Africa within month, governments willing pay them.

And undeniable reported daily/weekly doses instead dropping. bad part, whether first third doses give need keep used. Define 'Often'

And evidence occurred mask vaccine mandates, like claimed? Thinking people constitute silent majority highly correlated kind mathematical aptitude leads identify ~1.5% population ""a majority"". weird, exact opinion except reversed. culvers disappointing Even inadequate testing, Africa major problems Covid, would know now. Like India corpses flowing rivers funeral pyres overrun, haven‚Äôt similar reports Africa. 

WHO saying Africa would inevitably become boiling pot pandemic ever since Pandemic happened, yet occur. Even faced small delta spikes, cases went down. Simply put, Covid hasn‚Äôt major issue Africa. YEAH!!! possible get flu shot w booster (the 2 week window longer needed). got time!!! likely also lot countries face problems make COVID smaller problem those. Civil conflicts, violence, starvation, even worst kinds disease...it doubtful time makes sense big. like point maybe data reliable moment. article fails explain connection covid patients title. DIVI intensivregister website shows state Germany 11% intensive beds occupied covid patients. Also categorization vaccinated unvaccinated. seems different problem shortage ICU beds.

Felt like flu, depression, brain zaps whole 30 days. NYT licking chops see virus run rampant kill millions Chinese people.   Honest question: back Navalny arrested, read many Reddit posts saying many (most?) Russians generally 'okay' Putin (or least apathetic whomever power, since whomever fuck improve lives). Would instead say many (most?) Indeed hate Putin specifically? Same. Got COVID. Spent hour car multiple people. Slept bed next wife. Nobody got it. isn‚Äôt really good thing

Neither unmasked, unvaxed police walking around public day.

I'd prefer deal problem head rather accommodating people believe entitled ignore requirements public servant.  Could imagine covid could quickly spread thru unvaxxed small company? would crazy owner. can't even imagine taking risk business owner. again, last 4 years really opened eyes many stupid people America. 44 years old man oxygen. can't walk bathroom without needing take break. blood oxygen level drops *70s* knee bends. doctors say he'll likely need lung transplant.

He needs constant attention care. Imagine toll takes person mentally. Imagine insecurities internal turmoil struggle (when literally century crisis). Imagine feeling like burden ones love. 

This man survived COVID entered different hell system increasingly unkind ""able tug bootstraps."" 

I feel really bad guy, wife, kids- impossibly hard shoes, hard see someone love go something like family do. hope family gets community help strapped constant financial duress. non-issue.

They hire fire-fighters. first responders operating stretch losing less 1% workforce noticeable, already fucked. Russians fall misinformation campaigns. Russian social media full myths vaccine. Saying makes women infertile causing blood clots. fake study going around saying lowered IQ well. Average Russians largely believe it.

Even Russian friends took vaccine later sent articles types things said regretted it.

Part mistrust government, reported reasons friend group misinformation social media (vk, tiktok, pikabu) People actively enjoying people dying Russian, it‚Äôs pretty disgusting Great place stash in-laws quick life insurance payouts. mRNA technology, could reality Also Pfizer. mild side affects hit like ka-pow, subsided quickly. like system said ""wait, what's this?"" said ""Oh, okay."" Yes know statistically little impact kids. Age stratification real thing Covid. It‚Äôs reason vaccinated. opinion it‚Äôs reasonable debate folks young children. we. one four show symptoms. Queue? Unless I've missing dictatorial singing. Although Putin's ego _would_ tenor.  point, care protecting family. can‚Äôt convince anyone who‚Äôs unvaccinated get vaccinated.   Fuck this. I'm double vaxxed keep getting vaccinated every 6 months like I'm sort chronically ill person can't live without medication I'd rather get Covid.  think important thing think whether get virus, make sure best protection possible if/when do. 

If you‚Äôre triple dosed, keep future annual boosters made available, virus almost certainly much less danger normal risks accepted pre-crisis, traffic accidents.

If find unable make peace possibility catch virus, sincerely recommend finding way help make peace, talking friends, therapy, meditation, *ahem* getting Reddit bit, whatever works you. help actors name Carol, male wife works hospital kid ended at. said small kid.

Yea, mathing out, suspect planet needs planning 6-8 month booster likely one 12-18 months convince bodies keep enough antibodies around beat COVID we‚Äôre at. 7% antibody reduction per month falls 3% 8 months, like we‚Äôve seen expect to, closer 24 month, able guess 18 months. napkin super basic trend modeling we‚Äôve seen NAb results thus far, results may vary based actual efficacy ‚Äúbooster‚Äù 8 months. Basically, current set vaccines ideally timed titers don‚Äôt get high enough set life two doses, ‚Äúbooster‚Äù likely means vaccine needs three doses us got vaccinated originally, maybe four.

Now stat Hispanics already see pattern, poverty. born likely stay it. here, extrapolate numbers (which probably shouldn't) take average 1.93 kids per American household, adds additional 8 million people. we're 44 million can't read, around 13% total population polled immigrants. 34% children immigrants read average 7th grade level. little half immigrant families can't read well. That's hell lot people.

I'm blaming immigrants children here, fault came environment. important remember though statistically relevant looking things like national averages. also disabilities consider. 45 million Americans dyslexia. Among disability, 70-80 percent trouble accurate fluent word recognition originates weaknesses phonological processing, often combination fluency comprehension problems. we're ~1/4 population fault own, failure education system, pure simple bad luck.

So last 3/4 population fit last spots. math, last 3/4 spread across data set laid out. already heavily skewed towards illiteracy. last 3/4 cannot heavily skewed towards illiteracy. take actual population would've school, who's parents born here, disabilities, actually average much higher literacy rate.

It's like people comparing medieval lifespans. Heavily skewed towards lower morality extrenuous circumstances corrected, shows people live longer certain age. thing here, higher literacy rate remove extrenuous circumstances. think 100% means everybody?

We conducted severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 antibody seroprevalence study among domestic cats 4 countries first coronavirus disease wave Europe. found 4.4% seroprevalence using virus neutralization test 4.3% using receptor-binding domain ELISA, demonstrating probable human-to-cat transmission.

Conclusions 
During first COVID-19 pandemic wave, reported seroprevalence levels domestic cats ranged 0.4% Netherlands (4) 23% among cats COVID-19‚Äìpositive households France (13). Similar seroprevalence levels cats humans areas found us others suggest absence another known source (4,13; C. Schulz, unpublished data) (Appendix Table), SARS-CoV-2 infections cats likely due human-to-cat contact transmission. 
 
Most natural SARS-CoV-2 infections cats appear run mild subclinical course, respiratory gastrointestinal clinical signs reported confirmed natural infections (6‚Äì8). Evidence experimental studies suggests cats susceptible SARS-CoV-2 infection maintain virus within cat population spill infection backward forward species (2,3,14). However, evidence cat-to-human transmission, cat-specific mutations variants SARS-CoV-2, detected thus far (8,12,15). finding contrasts reports minks kept farms, mink-to-human spillback infections mink-specific mutations reported (5). Although evidence currently suggests domestic cats play role epidemiology human SARS-CoV-2 infection, clinicians veterinary practitioners recommend SARS-CoV-2‚Äìinfected persons avoid close contact domestic cats practice nonpharmaceutical prevention measures toward cats prevent human-to-human infection.

We really think ""bucket"" issue. Either vaccinated bucket natural immunity bucket - can't either/or, simple. know previously Covid conveys natural immunity, exactly, long? previous infection Alpha protect Delta? protect reinfection? natural immunity protect serious illness death? long effects last? absolutely know people previously Covid infection gone get vaccinated half likely get reinfected. vaccines provide value even previous infection.

 people get vaccine takes away choice get virus attain natural antibodies. 

The military takes choice away members induction day whole host illnesses - I'm curious Covid different? Either Moderna Pfizer would great.

The modified versions vaccines better enough justify using existing versions, least now. unlike Covid, regular flu extremely mild disease warrant taking risk medical interventions have. 1.8 billion people many live cramped cities.

Australia China risks individual ability control movement cannot really compared. According covid tracker site ... Vaccination stats: 54,000 least one dose; 37,000 1st dose.  Vax program started April 1st.

It‚Äôs interesting question. think dishonorable discharge likely incarceration, would military really want dishonorably discharge thousands this. honest, know little military. It‚Äôll interesting see plays out. evidence pointing vaccinated less infectious, shown comprehensive peer-reviewed studies yet afaik. is, people assume breakthrough cases infectious, particularly given delta.

Cuba major problem since july government detained protesters, major countries step asked liberation. Thing is, know them.

Maduro openly closed independent media, there's little none coverage negative news government (unless someone counts ones going public busses using speakers). Cuba, surprisingly, different sources independent media gets luxury publish editorial. yes, risk dissapear middle night there, always there, get comunicate that, inform.

Cuba ton problems, health system one them. makes think brainwashed birth, you? going guess who's propagandized, I'd say country kids swear loyalty oath every morning schools.

I'd think country calls political dissidents parasites, allow people leave country, allow free internet, and, know, allows communist party power... chances brainwashing citizens. saying, know. Americans weird culty nationalistic shit? Yes do. Cubans taught raised educational system wholly government-owned run? Yes, are. protests quite small, compared counterprotests support government, drew 10 times many people. course, US media reported one incidents. Because, know ... who's ""brainwashed""?

You know, I've already lived place simple trick pulled. turns government, single largest employer Cuba, simply force government employees go protest streets, lest want lose jobs.

No, that's ""through September"". Using number plus 1.6B per month gave numbers quoted.


This way disagreement posted. links production, donation doses. Kind late announcement, morning, Dave Blake announced 500 days straight daily COVID graphs, going week out, confident November going month endemic stage starts, point, really need focus much trends. obese likely severe case, correlates viral load, correlates infectiousness. yes likely hurt you. Yeah thought word 'majority' used definition... however looking online despite lot us perceive worst 'most', person replied use correctly. still feel clarified unintentionally mislead people believing things worse are. think safe :(   According link, didnt verify enough doses. report 7.2 B doses produced Nov. 2 doses per person means enough 3.6 B people. 3 doses (booster chinese vax basic immunization need 3) enough 2.4 B people, versus total population 7.9 B. So, short enough enough well within next year. Please consider sources provided unicef who. Also remember shortages needles expired doses.
According monthly production numbers provided, every rich country would give 2 doses we'd need 5.5 months production, 3 doses 10.25 months. Obviously everyone want dose, time without transportation vaccination time.   less likely CATCH virus fat. That‚Äôs real stretch. hate word ""jabbed."" exact thing felt like too! didn‚Äôt anything whole day. day back normal though! Remind never charge anything requires management people. neighbor's obesity would make vulnerable covid, thus likely make sick.  5 years significant chunk person's life. Well Germans ... unsolicited literal advice would Chiggity-check riggity-riggity-wreck yourself, Mr. Cube. I'm saying medical system needs change w disease. Also. Obesity contagious. fact much society consumerism end stage capitalism problem. One huge (no pun intended) still overwhelm system way covid does. Obese people stay vents ecmos months end. make elective surgeries halted. truly thing. go round round day this, never deny society super sick lots lots ways need care better ourselves, long corn sugar meat subsidized government, long people overworked still poor neither time money eat well, still problems covid. Yeah, thing China true. true must likely numbers wrong, also probably low number cases deaths compared countries. 

And reason both, authoritarianism. hide real number, also put extreme measures stop contagion, lock people up, lock cities, track sick people however want on.  feels like months ago Usa reached 100k deaths, remember special stories everywhere, news, late night tv etc. 

740k.. damn, maybe even already 1 million bc underreporting issue India, Brazil etc. think US probably actually deaths. We're definitely there, big country shitty response, many areas actually pretty decent response, extensive vaccine rollout (still better). think we're better counting every death.  made clear looking individual risk teens, still holds true, wider inpact society. fact stated:

"" JCVI¬†is constituted expertise allow consideration health benefits risks vaccination within remit incorporate in-depth considerations wider societal impacts, including educational benefits. government may wish seek views wider societal educational impacts chief medical officers 4 nations, representation from¬†JCVI¬†in subsequent discussions.""

So guess ...the government decided wider societal impacts important rolled vaccines teens. no, teens prevented vaccinated advice.

I would expect hospitalisation death rates higher places like Germany Covid passes. People acting like pandemic literally restrictions hardly anyone wears mask anymore. minority do. 

Mind you, US peachy topping charts world deaths pretty horrific vaccination rate, especially states, despite people 12 able get months throw away vaccines unused. UK worst place be. fed funding anything then. Worked seat belts. know of

Can confirm. Grandma cancer years, died COVID someone wear mask emergency room.

Grandpa side family died COVID going surgery (catching hospital).

&amp;#x200B;

Both cause deaths listed complications condition, COVID. Despite fact would lived 5+ years without covid  often wonder many would died, safety measures like masks, social distancing, etc. put perspective, like 5 times 1 million 1/5 population New Zealand saying there's possible way 100% vaccination rate eligible population. lies propaganda. can't accurate number? put propaganda stuff? News flash: every government does. two mutually exclusive.  honest, Brazilian somewhat trust numbers here. unified health system around country works pretty well believe numbers close reality, possible minor deviation. things mentioned periodically overwhelmed medical system, contagious

Litearlly thing that's killed people covid past year heart disease, leading risk factor obese. peak state, covid never took 10-15% beds. Now, that's massive problem systems designed operate limited capacity easily added to, yes, broader point is: Heart disease takes resources covid does. No, curing heart disease easy shot. I'm dense, get saying. Hell, I'm getting booster next week. say people sit tents behave way approve of, line medical system works.  Forsa also found Germany's increasingly overwhelmed hospitals little concern unvaccinated, **despite fact represent majority patients intensive care units.**

Some numbers show clearer:

1th Febuary - 12th September 2021

**People hospital**    
12-17 years old fully vaccinated: 1,248 (99.8%)  
12-17 years old fully vaccinated: 3 (0.2%)  
18-59 years old fully vaccinated: 43,800 (98.8%)

60 older fully vaccinated: 62,875 (97.6%)

60 older fully vaccinated: 20,044 (97.5%)  
60 older fully vaccinated: 512 (2.5%)  

I think important number 1 fully vaccinated person age 60 died Covid beginning February middle September Germany. end permanently disabled.  He's gonna get sued OSHA lol. He's ensured earlier availability whole population country except Israel could dream of, he's literally paying republican conspiracy nuts take vaccine. given brainwashed part population?  think is. ""vaccine hesitant"" person worried vaccine confused conflicted. Maybe garbage floating around social media spooked them. people might moved get vaccine.

A ""vaccine resister"" dead set vaccine. either strong beliefs vaccines general COVID vaccines particular. Fair enough. get paywall - article link original study studies? Finally rational person sticks criticizing country live work in. many people Reddit even left home state insane opinions countries.  Developping countries find soon enough vaccines, vaccine-skepticism, supply seal fate pandemic.

/laugh Romanian. Maybe. things mentioned periodically overwhelmed medical system, contagious. truth dealt w something like rules need change. Unvaxxed people take intensive resources weeks months end. People dying can't access medical care need (like surgeries dialysis) people chose get two shots. insane people right thing fellows punished. Obesity, smoking risky sports never able make claim. different every single person knows it. ok get mad it. stop true.

Edit: even mention lot people actively spreading misinformation vaccines, leaving trail death much bigger infect. Nope. deserve live die choices. change minds oxygen starved choice go hospital ask people shitting save them. still treat people like shit try everything save them. Nope. done w them. amount dead bodies ground never bigger ego people want win argument. means 44% hospitalized unvaccinated minority. majority citizens vaccinated % mean much. us best counts certainly

Why US best counts? 

Source? :( similar situation back September. all, I‚Äôd say 50 people 200 person wedding contracted COVID. vaccinated. 

I attended several weddings summer zero cases came (at least knowledge). think it‚Äôs crapshoot would interesting case study determine one super spreader others not. put perspective, 5 million people entire population New Zealand. Also remember China mostly dealing original virus dangerous variants. Delta makes original version look like child's play, China's worst wave beginning nearly bad say India spring wave.

As side note, people impression Wuhan zombie apocalypse media hyping back thought happen us spectacle foreign country. probably nothing compared happened large countries afterward, media keen portraying screwups total horror show. Lol. gave quite ""free"" image wish unimagine.  5% unvaccinated adults, minority population.  one said jobs... tight. There‚Äôs extra shifts. People working (hard). we‚Äôre point yet to, state, ban elective surgery

Absurd one would ban elective surgery CHOSE remain unvaccinated would get go front line.

&amp;#x200B;

I can't imagine working hard people... would demoralizing. Still baffled people lost elderly relatives protecting others virus. goes show little love actually family. husband checked box CVS saying we‚Äôre eligible. don‚Äôt even ask makes eligible. There‚Äôs shortage don‚Äôt see true harm getting one you‚Äôre 6+ months out. think that‚Äôs likely answer  row children stood behind holding handmade signs read ‚ÄúThe final variant communism‚Äù ‚ÄúProudly unpoisoned.‚Äù

Confirmed I'm shocked Cube antivaxxer. He's crazy train awhile now. entire hypothetical circular logic based hypothetically thinking eligibility question solves whole puzzle, youre casually ignoring fact defined even addressed cuban propaganda website looking at.

ergo, youre blabbing  countries someone intentionally large scale way DeSantis did. also started feeling weird left pharmacy. Fair enough put perspective, entire population New Zealand 5 million people Oh no, almost lost jobs ignorance. Unvaccinated dishonorable discharge. world lost lot 5M lives - also lost opportunity cost lockdown - people primes lives stay home live lives. Major social cost never hit ledger. dishonorable discharge, yeah. Yeah people declining shot tantrum throwers. usual. Let‚Äôs go straight JCVI statement, shall committee opinion benefits vaccination marginally greater potential known harms (tables 1 4) acknowledges considerable uncertainty regarding magnitude potential harms. margin benefit, based primarily health perspective, considered small support advice universal programme vaccination otherwise healthy 12 15-year-old children time.

Seems pretty clear me, seems pretty clearly wrong retrospect.

You can‚Äôt blame testing differences, article shared shows, current outbreak UK seen elevated hospitalization death rates well compared European peers - unaffected testing. Wild someone would dumb enough get dishonorable discharge this.

Glad say one ones actually quit! March 2020 pandemic first started went lack day smoker (smoked couple years) quitting cold turkey overnight year half. surpised lot states mislabeled covid deaths keep counts down.

That's almost certainly happening. Apparently big part new American ethos: 'I'd rather dead *wrong*'. 

Or maybe precisely: 'I'd rather *you* dead appear wrong myself'. No, misunderstood, seems wilfully, said. Teens eligible get vaccine, matter risk. roll slow, teen get one without parent's consent even. They've let get vaccination centres helped shitty anti vaxxers outside schools intimidating people.

We restrictions part reason higher case numbers. necessarily agree personally like government vote them.

 can't go around stating false facts saying we're allowing teens get vaccinated giving people one dose. 

And can't deny countries massively testing. UK gets shit free easily accessible testing programme, whereas certain areas (e.g. Florida, Texas, India, China etc) transparent Covid figures much worse opinion. Well, unfortunately easy seems...  Part problem countries undercounting also likely disproportionate number deaths (India, Bangladesh, Sub Saharan Africa, etc). end global excess deaths around 15 million, surprised.

Edit: fixed age correlate pretty strongly time since vaccination?

While vaccine protection appear wane, I'm certain particular study claim evidence waning reduce risk Delta infection home third

A drop 38% infected 25% infected reduction 1/3rd. Also study:

The proportion patients observed COVID-19 emergency setting 6 h transferred teritary hospital due COVID-19 lower fluvoxamine group compared placebo (79 [11%] 741 vs 119 [16%] 756); relative risk [RR] 0¬∑68; 95% Bayesian credible interval [95% BCI]: 0¬∑52‚Äì0¬∑88)...

There 17 deaths fluvoxamine group 25 deaths placebo group primary intention-to-treat analysis (odds ratio [OR] 0¬∑68, 95% CI: 0¬∑36‚Äì1¬∑27). one death fluvoxamine group 12 placebo group per-protocol population (OR 0¬∑09; 95% CI 0¬∑01‚Äì0¬∑47).

We found significant differences number treatment emergent adverse events among patients fluvoxamine placebo groups.

Interpretation

Treatment fluvoxamine (100 mg twice daily 10 days) among high-risk outpatients early diagnosed COVID-19 reduced need hospitalisation defined retention COVID-19 emergency setting transfer tertiary hospital...

Discussion

...Our trial found fluvoxamine, inexpensive existing drug, reduces need advanced disease care high-risk population. 10-day course fluvoxamine costs approximately US$4 even well-resourced settings.

Our study compares favourably treatment effects expensive treatments including monoclonal antibodies outpatient treatment.

The absolute number serious adverse events associated fluvoxamine lower placebo might reflect modulatory effect fluvoxamine systemic inflammation participants. Lower respiratory tract infections reported less frequently patients fluvoxamine group placebo group. concordant reduction hospital admissions patients confirmed COVID-19 treated fluvoxamine, numerically lower number patients requiring mechanical ventilation.



Further, 5% reduction deterioration mentioned absolute risk reduction basis, understanding (not science field) greater absolute risk reduction calculated phase III studies vaccines. 68% relative risk reduction hospitalisations one compare risk reductions quoted everywhere media vaccines, numbers quoted relative risk reduction calculations.

Less adverse events fluvoxamine arm compared placebo, cheap study premier medical journal - seems like great result me. question mark end title?  Yes, aware that. said, appear vaccines using, post-Delta, least, make really substantial reductions _infection_ rates. Absolutely mostly prevent hospitalizations severe cases, that's going end waves infection. Yeah, 5% *claimed* left jobs.

Here's Tuesday, advisory panel U.S. Food Drug Administration recommended children ages 5-11 made eligible Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. FDA CDC must also approve vaccine age group, could happen early next Next horizon Pfizer ‚Äî vaccine currently available people 18 ‚Äî children 5. Here‚Äôs know ###Is vaccine development children Yes. Right now, Pfizer conducting clinical trials vaccine children young 6 months old. trials kids split three age groups: 5-11, 2-5, 6 months 2 years ###Is vaccine young children one Pfizer formula age groups same, though dosage size differs. clinical trials, children 5 receiving even smaller dose Pfizer vaccine children 5-11, received smaller dose people 12 adults, kids 12 kids 5-11, children 5 receiving two doses, three weeks ###When vaccine children 5 Results clinical trials children 5 could come soon end year, Pfizer spokesperson confirmed. Results children 2-5 come first, followed children 6 months 2 years old.  addition 10 years ago knowledge vaccines lower, well quality pulmonary ventilators Preach!   sure. went Turks Caicos end January already requiring sign affidavits travelled China. tiny island already knew shit hit fan definitely active cases pretty much everywhere point.

Edited add: would travelled back U.S. govt CDC advised it. way China highest death toll. Let's say 10x reported numbers, that's still 10,000 *less* reported deaths Florida alone.

USA highest reported toll, 754,000. cannot hide many disease-caused deaths concentrated 4 months start pandemic, even China. horror like would witnessed many people keep secret long. think it‚Äôs combination things.

There perception children largely asymptomatic virus, true long term effects vaccine literally impossible predict. Perhaps long term effects COVID children (which also yet unknown) even worse, even thought sole agent harm children horrible imagine.

Additionally, medical authorities bit circumspect recommendations. say recommending it, emphasizing personal choice. many serious medical authorities really saying ""oh god get vaccine children die"" like adults. districts yet weighed whether vaccination mandatory enrollment.

Also everyone already back school, sports resuming, kids playing together again, practical lifestyle perspective much improvement had. intents purposes life already returned normal them, is. sense urgency yet there.

Again, perception. anecdotal evidence here, coworkers quit jobs vaccines already massive pains ass complained constantly made everyone else's job miserable. greater 90% certain also case here. people probably already looking way out. ü•≥üéâ basic math. Pick preferred estimate number cases.

Now [2% age-independent estimate found needing Obviously age plays big role percentages different age groups, India young country. However, know India's health system completely overloaded tons people getting oxygen.

So, assume 10% India got Covid spike (potentially conservative), that's 140 million cases. those, 2.8 million would need bed.

India, according WB [has one hospital bed every 2000 700,000 beds. fourth beds would needed 1 10 India got Covid wave. unable get bed needed one would died. 

So that's back envelope estimate 2.1M dead India likely conservative estimate. increase ratio got Covid come increase beds. assumes every bed empty wave began.

And many hospital beds nowhere near rural villages. places, severe Covid case unlikely survivable. Per Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) used collect reports adverse events vaccination general public. primarily used identify potential topics investigate regards vaccine reactions.

Objective: Sleep complaints frequent acute COVID-19. Aim study videopolysomnographically evaluate sleep sleep disorders SARS-Cov2 infection. 
 
Methods: Patients suspected sleep disorders acute COVID-19 underwent video-polysomnography (v-PSG) Sleep Disorders Clinic, Department Neurology, Medical University Innsbruck. V-PSG conducted 4.2 (SD = 1.3) months diagnosis SARS-CoV-2 infection. 
 
Results: Eleven patients \[nine men, age 52.5 (SD = 11.7) years; BMI 29 (SD = 5.2) kg/m2\] included. 60 days follow-up diagnosis, persisting breathing complaints present 7/11 (64%) patients. v-PSG four patients (36%) diagnosed obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Respiratory frequency sleep normal tachypnea, thoracoabdominal asynchrony, periodic deep sighing detected. Four patients (36%) showed REM sleep without atonia (RWA), two additional patients showed RWA index within highest range normality. 
 
Conclusion: report videopolysomnographic findings series eleven patients acute COVID-19. major finding study presence isolated RWA, recognized prodromal stage RBD, one third patients. Future videopolysomnographic investigations including quantification RWA patients COVID-19 give insights possible acute post-infectious CNS pathology related SARS-CoV-2 infection.

In case scales, look lower end upper end, can't necessarily draw rational conclusions looking number - otherwise person highly likely wrong. 

In case scale showing zero item it, can't reasonably say/conclude: ""this item weighs nothing"" despite number 0. hit top range scale, ""this item weighs x"" can't reasonably concluded since maxed scale reasonably tell you; person say ""the scale saying item weighs x"", thinking it, conclusion ""the item weighs x scale says so"".   ‚úåüèª  kids lose family members, I‚Äôd say hurts them, wouldn‚Äôt agree?

Once fully vaccinated risk drops near zero. can‚Äôt speak parents unvaccinated children, speak myself, allow reassure you: daughter fully vaccinated, care, even slightest, anybody else getting vaccinated. Yes. Recent updates death estimates looking 4 million lower end 8 million high end. reading one study single province India experienced 300k excess deaths Delta surge.

My son (aged 4) also received vaccinations.

I'm US country high quantity anti-vaxxers either.

The lowest age group UK currently receiving vaccine 12-15.

Approving stretch.

Below latest JCVI, recommend universal vaccination 12-15 age group.

They recommend children underlying health conditions, universally children aged 12-15.

[JCVI statement COVID-19 vaccination children aged 12 15 years: 3 September current update relates JCVI‚Äôs review considerations vaccination children aged 12 15 years underlying health conditions put increased risk COVID-19. precautionary approach agreed given low risk serious disease aged 12 15 years without underlying health condition puts increased risk. Given low risk, considerations potential harms benefits vaccination finely points consideration include admission rates children underlying co-morbidities substantially higher healthy children ‚Äì evidence prompted advice vaccination children aged 12 clinical risk. extent indirect benefits highly uncertain given current understanding impact vaccination transmission short medium term. Understanding current future role schools wider transmission, due previous use non-pharmaceutical interventions, increases uncertainty potential impact available evidence indicates individual health benefits COVID-19 vaccination small aged 12 15 years underlying health conditions put risk severe COVID-19. potential risks vaccination also small, reports post-vaccination myocarditis rare, potentially serious still process described. Given rarity events limited follow-up time children young people post-vaccination myocarditis, substantial uncertainty remains regarding health risks associated adverse committee opinion benefits vaccination marginally greater potential known harms (tables 1 4) acknowledges considerable uncertainty regarding magnitude potential harms. margin benefit, based primarily health perspective, considered small support advice universal programme vaccination otherwise healthy 12 15-year-old children time. longer-term data potential adverse reactions accrue, greater certainty may allow reconsideration benefits harms. data may available several reviewed UK data hospital admissions, paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) admissions deaths children aged 12 15 years. vast majority children aged 12 15 years, SARS-CoV2 infection asymptomatic mildly symptomatic, self-limiting. children aged 12 15 years develop severe illness requiring hospital attendance, majority underlying health conditions.

[Covid-19: JCVI opts recommend universal vaccination 12-15 year anyone know FDA come different conclusion even lower age group? Plus reduced death 100%, small sample died test group. 8 people control died 0 received medicine. parents know vehemently pro-vaccine hesitant get young children vaxxed. 

It's confusing I'm parent can't fully empathize. son tested lab confirmed. know covid can't take little kids get tested anywhere, three day lag calling doctor getting results.

I isolated tested three days prior symptoms (through happenstance) ten days recovered. negative. Got antibody tested weeks later negative well.

It impossible distance sick toddler. figured likely contagious well symptoms going get matter point. No. molnupiravir targets mechanism RNA based viruses use replicate RNA. Since human genomes DNA based, RNA replication mechanism effectively targets RNA viruses doesn‚Äôt harm human cells. It‚Äôs actually cool stuff.

Ivermectin targets parasites, also DNA genomes, it‚Äôs all. point don‚Äôt actually know CDC ACIP actually *recommend* vaccine 5-11 year olds, much less mandate it.

They might say kids *can* get certain kids *recommended* get it. Much like boosters. 

My gut says prob recommend we‚Äôll see next week. studies unvaccinated people already Covid-19? atudies I‚Äôve seen unvaxed v vaxed, reinfections v breakthrough infections like this. another irrelevant note, rains sometimes Better tell family didn‚Äôt go jail saying wrong thing wrong person.  damn close.

Then month later, pay everyone vaccinated second date. Everyone already vaxxed, new ones last month. Maybe even third time month that. amount time.

Point being, sooner vax, get allowed double triple dip. longer wait, less get.

Costly? Yes. Waste taxpayer dollars? Yes‚Äîin sense money spent convincing antivaxers right thing. bet long run, it'll cheaper cost hospitalizations, work disruptions, etc.  Florida entered chat.   100% agree. None cable networks on. Put AFN maybe training/safety videos something need something else. probably month first doses high degree protection Delta. Maybe 6 weeks count second dose,  little 2 get benefit first dose. kids get vaccinated teachers get third doses (and places cases high) there's certainly point masking classes.  Strong copium. could handle Also possible vaccinated people higher risk long covid symptoms.

Nonsense. announcing plans fewer cops. That's exactly hate cruel plot twists.  good thing should‚Äôve approved back summer. case, doctor give specific medicine, doctor wrote *prescription*. admitting doctor hospital politely declined fulfill prescription.

One things that's come times various studies (including, limited, one published today - - repeated exposure virus (or vaccine, both) produces ever-stronger immune responses.

Adding together trying put together mental model next years interesting. would suggest breakthrough infections become less common time, less serious. everyone get Covid infections (possibly several times) then.

The bad news conclusion would ""flatten curve"" slogans thus far fundamentally futile, beyond delaying tactic people get shit together. good news severity every future wave less previous one.

That's say older guys innocent, usually know better rock boat. theory using excess deaths US would second, India Like said, exacerbate underlying condition.   That's dumb comment. 

To start, actually acknowledge China better job protecting country Covid measures. Lots things done think countries also done. 

However, clear enforce kind measure, need absolute power people's freedom, means enforcing lockdown, locking people going measures, tracking people knowing home not, on. surely breaks people's privacy kind thing authoritarian country without much protests on. average human volume 62 liters, olympic-sized swimming pool contains around 2.5 million liters. liquefied entire population New Zealand, could fit 124 olympic swimming pools.   Vaccinated people still vectors transmission though. 93% 12s vaccinated Ireland yet hospitalisations still rising fast. Even 100% vaccinated we'd likely seeing rising hospitalisations right   Sooner better there's Delta area.   American political parties represent class interests owners. Nothing America given working class, fight die it. I'm Belarus know repressions, censorship propaganda looks like.

Listening Coloradoans discuss like living Twilight Zone. Ah makes sense. Thanks! point captured causes unusual behaviors. crimes, crimes money. Thank linking! nope. personally think health system great democratic socialism way go, claiming 100% population anything clearly ridiculous.

its actually possible nuanced stuff dunno? 

I can't import cars Europe Asia America unless 25 years old. Excess mortality stats really necessary give us better perspective. incidence and/or mortality rates pneumonia pneumonia-like conditions ""possibly"" ""likely"" COVID, would help us bridge data gap. personally, think governments would rather like see ""decreasing COVID numbers"" look ""questionable data"". would difficult get numbers right.  Nobody's run phase 3 trials that, percentage (which changes time anyway). one hand: ""That's lot.""

On another hand: ""That's it?""

It's number know process. :/ pro-capitalist parties forbidden. whole thing tightly controlled there's lot coercion involved. lots people go jail cuba saying wrong thing. state approved opposition parties allowed. Thats true, would live US healthcare rather Cuba healthcare. feel nothing. made choice. That‚Äôs 1 every 1,000 humans.

Yes, many countries unable, unwilling, outright lie numbers. hope trespassed campus. surprised US. surpised lot states mislabeled covid deaths keep counts down. OK. lockdown appears rather symbolic. Unless mayor administration dramatic change heart decides actually enforce it, effects probably marginal. tbh real number probably high 90's decided pump number made seem like miss single person. need do.   Wow, amazing number. Personally think would high number makes sense. 5 million Covid seems super low knowing average normal year 60 - 70 million, thank you! behaviours changed bit after, especially early summer. still always worn masks indoors public spaces. cut back everything delta started rising late summer. got booster last weekend, change behaviour much daughter still vaccinated (hopefully happens next week -- that's big hitch plans). Ugh, I‚Äôll bet. I‚Äôm extreme grateful family vaccinated (except 9-year-old, fervently hope soon!) Army tents. Womp womp american dont think that.  close ship Ohio? Oh well. what‚Äôs everyone lunch?  yeah really simple like /s Boost American buddy, I'm Cuban. understand always voting 2 guys working party whole time? never even knew hear different thinking. add little context, went gay bar havana 2019 lit af. best doctors scientists world. definitely fear. That‚Äôs got booster. you‚Äôre gonna get next booster, next.

Im done Covid, like everyone else who‚Äôs gotten survived, everyone who‚Äôs old obese dying anyway. UK continues battle COVID rates higher nearly every country, it‚Äôs increasingly clear grave mistake made withholding universal vaccination 12-15 year Christina Pagel, director Clinical Operational Research Unit University College London, said lag approval vaccines 12- 15-year-olds enormous mistake.

So no, I‚Äôm wildly misinformed; take step back consider latest evidence.  I'm okay eliminating embargo right now. I'm sure communist lie die quicker none blame. Cuba let us send vehicles family there? Even pay everything, want to. India almost certainly highest death count, given devastation Delta wave spring. Bodies literally piling faster could buried cremated. accounts, catastrophic.

FWIW, would bet China's toll significantly higher reported, orders magnitude higher, number Sinophobic media outlets suggested. Here's why: likely lot death early (the pandemic started there) knew happening. could obfuscate numbers easily wanted to. response quick, harsh, largely effective--if been, would known. would extremely hard hide pandemic really got going. able hide hundreds thousands deaths; I'd say assume could give much credit. day age. could see true toll China several times higher, nearly high estimated. Exactly, example also Ireland Costa Rica Lots problems, screw-ups, inexperience, company US gov‚Äôt. Politico covering pretty well lately. latest article today: Oh, right, America knows right way run elections, judge true democracy. Like American 40 million people voted democrats senate, somehow 50/50. America disenfranchises minority voters creating districts intentionally dilute voting power.

Or third parties basically shut competing via state laws protect two party system.

I really appreciate silly Americans talking United States also one-party state but, typical American extravagance, two them. - Julius Nyerere  Yeah, absolutely zero standing federal contractors. I'm sure knows that. He's score points crazies. That's reason.  hard count people burn bodies people consider people first place.

Nah, got booster simply fear covid all. I'm also tired reading 1200 people dying completely unnecessary deaths daily got again, would nothing.

The problem poor recording keeping outlying areas hard estimate. okay. if. Like would answer phone like boomer. :) X4 according research linked Cdc guidance 3-5 days exposure, somewhere range. would assume longer wait confident results be. Also number tests, Asia almost non-existent Africa... years close 60 million (I think threshold crossed 2019), I've read 2020 70 million deaths Well, thank grown ups decided lying total deaths would somehow protect us knowing harsh world really is. safely go commute underpaying job environment destroying choice conveyance order make funds needed big annual holiday tithings make wealthy superiors. Isnt life *great*? Instead getting sick Covid...I choose cancer. many people know smoked died lung cancer. guess paying someone kill off. one dirty habits blow money die slowly put perspective, ENTIRE population New Zealand absolutely higher 

This research Economist realy eye popping, use excess death statistics around world calculate actual covid death tolls, vs. official death tolls. 

Official world death toll covid 5M, actual death toll 19m. 

Official death toll US 743k. Actual death toll likely around 930k. Russia death toll frightening. 

ITs great resources continually updated. Highly recommended reading G D. pray sooooooo hard them! Cuba indeed much better--A couple months ago, Cuba highest rate new cases entire World I've actually living Mexico 7 years due healthcare - can't afford US teacher salary lol.

But Fidel leader **49 years**, **his brother** Raul leader **10 years**. 
Its enough consider problems. 6G?! That's upgrade! satellite dish now? want point article two paragraphs long makes bold statement front without elaborating it. early tell?

This. partly depends common cases future (and many vaccinated people, recently people vaccinated, etc), often boosters given, etc. know long 3rd doses give infection protection. Also, new vaccines may give better protection infection. Yeah, I'm saying that's did, saying OP article say ""eligible population"" means, really communicate much anything unless ""eligible population"" agreed upon meaning I'm aware of. Seems like bizarre sword throw probably Americans choose stuff abundant junk food, follow unhealthy diets general. lots cheap food everywhere, people easily afford it. Still remember seeing little debbie pies sugary ""drinks"" everywhere, cost less dollar. Meanwhile minimum wage 8 dollars/hour, people make significantly that. people means aren‚Äôt going theme parks assaulting staff don‚Äôt like told wear mask.

*Generally speaking*, someone high socioeconomic status isn‚Äôt going throw away break teenagers jaw. exceptions generalization, they‚Äôre exceptions rule.

 Furthering point, got sentenced 5-10 years prison. money, definitely isn‚Äôt going much anymore. I'm concerned all, want what's effective. I'll probably stick Pfizer though, simplicity. end, I've gone six months Pfizer without getting COVID, clearly still good, even Moderna's better. least get J&amp;J. Yea side effects worse? That‚Äôs info can‚Äôt find anywhere  Yeah go:

Cuba isn‚Äôt weird shithole seem think p good health science compared American European nations. Public vs Private school changes nothing lol. people fleeing Cuba former rich plantation owners dissatisfied share.

Crazy concept actually slightly interested Latin American countries talking shit lol. I've seen people argue ""it's weird show professionals favor vaccine!""

...which almost professionals favor vaccine, course. mind blowing used argument vaccine. Vaccine mandates constitution Counted number close 5 million, true number probably like 12 13 million point. others said, least twice count (10M), good number populous countries widely acknowledged reported lower true number (some intentionally, others many died fast count them, others genuine mistakes). You‚Äôre right think it‚Äôs subtle ‚Äúdon‚Äôt ACTUALLY take vaccine.‚Äù don‚Äôt get logic all, hopefully scare enough catches it. Doubtful doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm gonna try  you‚Äôre saying mandate 99% survival rate  Considering Florida at-will employment state, ironic say least Looking NYT tracker looks might reaching plateau again? Hopefully progress stall üôÅ

Lol good general, Cuba slightly higher life expectancy USA dude. im American... educated American school. educated Venezuelan school, anything, negative influence modern imperialism highlighted rather probably largely ignored like US. trump also took vaccine haha...i friend solidly anti mask, anti vaccine, anti everything really. said he'd never wear mask trump wear one. 

i sent video trump wearing mask event amazingly, found reason wear one okay get time Proud? Lol. Someone right thing forced isn‚Äôt something proud of. Anyone getting vaccine pathetic. Hold on, let get popcorn Americans pile onto this.

Yes. one earliest priorities Cuban government. living difficult time We're war. military budget bloated. without them.  read 100% means context. Several places achieved 100% first-dose vaccination eligible adult population, Cuba. 200K military service (Army, Navy, Marines, AirForce, etc), right? \~12K Air Force, 5% ... OTOH, small price pay weed people follow lawful orders. probable realistic estimate puts India 2 million deaths, much higher official number absurd claims recent months... shit pisses too.

Maybe are, can‚Äôt know sure Cuba totalitarian regime.  thanks making counterpoint based something purely hypothetical can, fact, vote often US far, far bigger turnout: 2020 US election considered record turnout 66.8% whereas 85.75% turnout 2018 cuban parliamentary election lower side standard. Well, let's exaggerate now. total deaths certainly 10 million, even double official figures, go far. Around 10/15 million probable figure see public education showing lmao forget big deal though. People Cuba can't choose governs them. communist party can, decided so. everyone thumb. leave group people govern long, corruption decay inevitable. 

Oh, communism model ALWAYS failed. Famine, authoritarianism, falling behind othe developed Western countries even going backwards cases. think ""communist"" states remain? seeing US sanctions could much use there, especially since massive trading partner right next door, yet, shithole there. yep, failed mention two important things. disrespectul, vaccine (cuban origin) probably phisiological solution, mention sourece page comunist party central committe, disrespecful going politics, regime trusted least development medicine vaccines. know reddit people like proclaim 

if trying ""win"" conversation, maybe need step back take long look personality.
 
getting angry me, even part conversation telling going -- yet another reason might want that.
 
imma stop trying help now, good luck figuring things out. Reddit. there‚Äôs one thing I‚Äôve learned type people, don‚Äôt care it‚Äôs life line. Also I‚Äôll tell Trump used Regeneron he‚Äôll that‚Äôs daddy dictatorship

have ever talked actual cubans cuba? could potentially many India alone undercounted, huge wave Delta population 1% vaccinated hit. So, virus 100% survivable? round numbers too. /s Oh shit, sucks. I've got lingering extreme fatigue (more year later) bad restless legs. still get occasional covid brain too. Hopefully time goes on, we'll feel better.  Oh no!
Anyway. working: economically, socially politically. localised outbreaks (down residential area city) time time (I seen 2 year city), get contained quickly life totally normal almost forget virus except strict rule wearing masks subway, using scanning qr code access public spaces (malls, cinemas..).The maximum measures would requiring pcr tests travelling original city outbreak. bet aren‚Äôt missed coworkers think \*want\* discharge them, would rather get vaccinated deadline. OTOH, soldiers follow lawful orders useful military, discharge sounds reasonable (honorable otherwise). think suddenly start listening you? Especially 100% means all, frequently close quite all. live Canada. US-born American Engineers come Huston Austin, Texas oil gas jobs here. can't even write official email correct spellings.

How 100% literate educated people graduated MIT forget write office email? That‚Äôs kind pervasive myth every vaccine. It‚Äôs like default trope fall back on. hearing one long covid. elections every 2.5 years also easily recall elected representatives they're fulfilling mandate electors. suggesting people refuse vaccine get incarcerated? sounds really dumb ... would military want keep people jail?

If think make likely get vaccinated stay, rather incarcerated, makes sense, normally want disgruntled employees (much less soldiers) forced stay. That's volunteer military.  proposition someone affirms true, belief. matter whether suss logic. wrong? change saying? know reddit people like proclaim without evidence, im wondering thats youre choose help COVID19 patients unvaccinated instead canceling elective procedures? get Thank you, thought scanning article, thought would nice put norm article reference. Explains excess mortality rates guess.... confuse 1.23 lakh deaths statement googled it.

Lakh means ""a hundred thousand""

So saying issued 123,096.16 death certificates compared 58,000 last year time.

Take example following scenario. take two temperature probes oven warms up. probe difference thickness metal, yielding slightly different readings. thinner probe reads quickly, lot noise data due inconsistency air inside oven. thicker probe reads slowly delay, temperature curve reading smoothly. better representing actual internal temperature given time? great question ask misses point. proxies useful way. worth splitting hairs it. Data collection inherently messy. another example. bag freshly roasted coffee packed degassing valve. bag says 12 oz coffee. time bag reaches consumer slightly less 12 oz. correct weight? Weighing item days apart yields different weight reading. Data often account changing variables. Cuba says 100% eligible people vaccinated, well least people eligible today eligible tomorrow, immediately nullifying accuracy data. think fair say 100% reflected data point time. Otherwise point collect data report all. Science doesn‚Äôt political side. author confused anyways. passage quote doesn‚Äôt even make determination.

Watch out! Counterfeit vaccines!

They're right next Nyke shoes Ralex watches! im cuban american. i'm sure limited access anti-vax propaganda helps airplane flights 92% survival rate, would seeing 8,000 airplane crashes day world.

92% survival rate isn‚Äôt it‚Äôs cracked be. Colorado wear mask anymore here. mask mandate. incredibly disheartening. worst nation new cases well. understand doctor's offices mask required every single employee local target wearing mask, okay too? Absolute insanity... human mind. truly believe God-given immune system proven strongest communicable disease.

That vaccines work.  committee recommends mRNA boosters 

\- people received two doses Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine

\- adults age 70

\- front-line health-care workers short interval first two doses

\- people First Nations, Inuit Metis communities. two modernas took third, bear mind bias.

if anxiety, would choose third pfizer ever hear side effects, recalls, effectiveness rates, etc etc etc keep track one company joke, could never achieve 100% real situation countries Latin America literacy rates around 95%

Peru, Dominican Republic Paraguay 94%, Colombia, Panama Mexico 95%, Chile 96%, Costa Rica 97%, Uruguay 98%, Argentina Cuba 99%. 

So Cuba definitely higher end spectrum, it‚Äôs like they‚Äôre anomaly crazy literacy rates region.

The difference even less stark look age groups.

For Latin American countries, literacy rates among people 30 around 99%. Colombia, Chile, Mexico, Costa Rica, Cuba, Ecuador, 99% literacy rates kids young adults. know thats whats going case? got two doses Pfizer April I'm getting booster Sunday.
