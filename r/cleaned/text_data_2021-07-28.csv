Oops. Yes. That's meant. Salesforce policy. vaccine, office customer visits.

Going get tricky manage. one making calls. hope everyone knows that. he's puppet PR üçª find crazy following recommendations CDC way controversial. pasting assume people read headlines. student, perhaps direct anger toward fellow unvaccinated classmates driving recommendations. may vaccinated, minority US

‚ÄúAdded recommendation fully vaccinated people wear mask public indoor settings areas substantial high transmission. 

Added information fully vaccinated people might choose wear mask regardless level transmission, particularly immunocompromised increased risk severe disease COVID-19, someone household immunocompromised, increased risk severe disease fully vaccinated.

Added recommendation fully vaccinated people known exposure someone suspected confirmed COVID-19 tested 3-5 days exposure, wear mask public indoor settings 14 days receive negative test result.

CDC recommends universal indoor masking teachers, staff, students, visitors schools, regardless vaccination status.‚Äù

And cue downvotes.  Good point! Right. Jesus, use Small children schools allowed vaccinated, forced choose COVID masking. enough adults cared, they'd get vaccinated kids make choice. supposed protect children, put front lines. Illegal Who's gonna get world record covid vaccine shots? care unluckily people, want minor inconvenience myself!

Maybe way off. read many scientific things I'm public school dude.  COVID evade vaccines. everyone vaccinated pandemic would over.

Eventually everyone exposed mortality rates drop poor countries let remain endemic, give annual flu vaccines doubt start including COVID along them. still risk elderly vulnerable people, flu always is. remains seen whether cause permanent drop life expectancy, rather, long take life expectancy return 2019 levels.

WTF

2 weeks top existing cluster fuck going disastrous isn‚Äôt mask mandates county buildings. Read quoted article, click link yourself. choice. 
This isn‚Äôt mask mandates county buildings. Read quoted article, click link yourself. choice. mask wearing reduces personal reproductive rate 25%, vaccines reduce 90%, vaccinated people wearing masks could save tens thousands unvaccinated lives medium-case scenario.

But real reason obviously US vaccine passports, way make unvaccinated wear masks. I'm sure got votes this, accurate. I've read can't arsed find data suggesting vaxxed spread Delta pretty well. Maybe well unvaxxed, still. Spread spread.


I know pre post arrival tests required still, good. I'm bit uncertain feeling too. Tho traveling anyway, 4 year old can't get jab yet. piece shit.  literally mask mandates businesses

Nobody disagreeing part point. It‚Äôs also thoroughly explained OP link. 

This isn‚Äôt mask mandates county buildings. Read quoted article, click link yourself. choice. Maybe kids get shots. opposite bad news, suggests vaccination reduces risk infection (not symptomatic disease) 80%. par figures found credible studies. I'm taking everything one day time. can't control people government reacts hope best. Yeah, money, G show much better bottom-line, old school companies follow get bandwagon. 5600 hospitalizations 161 million vaccinated.

Yes, works. Crucify me, get vaccine get exempted to. survival rate 99% mostly lethal elderly people preexisting conditions. vaccine approved FDA knows trusted may fear wrath already got vaccine. know long term implications getting vaccine yet, people mainly young people getting myocarditis. Covid cure stupidity. wondering income really indicative education level, someone sources news, distrust institutions (government, legal, medical), etc‚Ä¶ would explain ‚Äúwhy‚Äù. year ago, last July mask mandates started become prominent United States. asked someone year ago would implementing new mask mandates year now, would say no. shouldn‚Äôt believe exact thing year now? Jacobson v. Massachusetts 1905 They're probably also worried getting canceled.

This old news. sure OP posted it. festival starts tomorrow always required vaccination negative test. quoting suspect relevant part (correct I'm pandemic‚Äôs early days, Dr. Fauci tended cite 60 70 percent estimate experts did. month ago, began saying ‚Äú70, 75 percent‚Äù television interviews. last week, interview CNBC News, said ‚Äú75, 80, 85 percent‚Äù ‚Äú75 80-plus telephone interview next day, Dr. Fauci acknowledged slowly deliberately moving goal posts. so, said, partly based new science, partly gut feeling country finally ready hear really Hard may hear, said, believes may take close 90 percent immunity bring virus halt ‚Äî almost much needed stop measles Asked Dr. Fauci‚Äôs conclusions, prominent epidemiologists said might proven right. early range 60 70 percent almost undoubtedly low, said, virus becoming transmissible, take greater herd immunity stop it.

So, kind understand creating hesitancy trust individual statements public figure. kinda get it, time, really see kind change lack accountability part. 

I'm looking defend individual statements, think important look broader context it: we're pandemic novel virus, literally know know. much we'd like consistency planning leadership, going limit without making wild predictions crystal ball. 

I'd rather look trend information publishes one statement. long he's fluctuating wildly constantly walking back statements, follows expectation developing understanding narrowing focus need. 

In short: really manipulative. Fauci best cause panic still delivering information people need hear. Kind like anyone would they're trying explain sudden life change family figure new dating partner: start small, explore trust levels, watch responses build there. 

Unfortunately, war economics models honed centuries experience. stuff brand new. even hard best scientists, that's hard is. explain critical is, source distrust. fully vaccinated person (Pfizer, March) sitting home covid, uh yeah.

Note: I‚Äôm recovering glad got jab lessen symptoms kind drugs on? seem fun never worth it. spead. No‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not. masks mayors didn‚Äôt announce mandates businesses pleaded help get employees vaccinated urged implement use masks. like positive thinking better vaccine coming soon. link document abstract. Click ""preview pdf"" see study. 

Unfortunately know better regards science it! getting people vaccinated much trouble even harder get people intentionally infect virus. cases spread naturally probably won‚Äôt enough stop covid spread. Oh sure see said right [here] yes, could always require ones risked losing customers

That's still case. know people would inclined accepting oppose mask mandate know govt forcing business one. might, given stupid people this. cant get population vaccinated, might stuck long time. anyone non paywalled version? Hello neighbor mean likely factor. virus exposed means likely infected, that, invaded germs. germs = bad. germs = get sicker. 

So yeah factor. suffer head injury

Hell no. smart went DINK. cheerios leather seats either. numbers, assuming exposed. 

Yeah....no.

If wanted measure efficacy vaccines see reduction risks relative unvaccinated, yes, look different denominator.

But simply want know ""how much risk COVID-19 pose hospitalizing/killing I'm vaccinated?"" (which I'd argue people actually interested in), looking number hospitalized everyone who's gotten fully vaccinated deeply informative. No, don‚Äôt think Florida courts see way. state protecting rights students education, legislature authority do. addition, Florida courts conservative courts entire country. Florida Supreme Court alone 7 Republicans 0 Democrats. think state wouldn‚Äôt much trouble defending law court setting. change prompted new data suggesting even vaccinated people infected Delta may carry large amounts virus transmit others

Isn't common sense though? experts known advised accordingly?

There zero reason lift mask mandate community reached herd immunity.

Advice worth paid it. Good luck. Cruise lines inconsistent mess comes covid requirements. Sometimes cruise lines different requirements depending ports cruise US, definitely differences across cruises starting US ports starting foreign ports.

In addition inconsistency lot changes occur policy week week. Ships require vaccines suddenly ships require masks suddenly do.

Replace 'wearing mask' 'getting vaccine', 'chance catching COVID' 'chance dying COVID', argument people want COVID vaccine.

That said, totally get coming from, lot people fine wearing masks balking wearing masks since vaccine proven effective. Mostly correct, save points:

1. masks remarkably well preventing emission larger respiratory droplets. much smaller aerosolized particles, N95 significantly effective. However, still know % cases result larger respiratory droplet transmission versus smaller aerosolized particles travel distance air. longest time assumed surgical masks nothing protect wearer others since virus order 100s nanometers size, figured mask would good. assumption turned false. learn ... 

2. speculative quite doubtful rest lives look like this. pandemics never obvious finish line. case 1918 pandemic, lasted two years. time third world's population infected. game changer time around widely available vaccine have. We're already well way towards world attaining immunity SARS-CoV-2 descendants, going take longer us would want.

I blame unvaccinated fully spread seeing comes restrictions..there something lot people missing. Many people vaccinated never vaccinated.

Vaccine mandates good solution states need implement them. consider may liar. FIL first claimed CARDIOLOGIST told get vaxxed. Upon probing turns asked doctor all. triple bypass surgery.

I can't fucking wait hear cry it. hope end going it. Mandate get it. much.  oddball mix companies, they‚Äôre least thing right. actually populations grow. number new cases *rate change* population size, population sizes time follow something called logistic function. red line graph logistic curve:

The blue line graph derivative (the *rate change*) red line. Note goes quickly went up, symmetric. given that's generally populations anything grow, we'd actually much expect number new cases graph UK look exactly (as daily new cases derivative total numbers infected delta). fuck man? came asking people think, told think based hundreds scientific papers I've read. want believe see TV matter what, bother asking discussion. Due respect, sound full  boosters necessary general population yet. waning immunity necessarily indicate ADE; could reduction total number antibodies system.

As understand, ADE means antibodies produced help virus rather hurt it. There's indication Covid. vaccines still reduce frequency infection upwards 80%.   dude REALLY doesn‚Äôt want wear mask he‚Äôs looking facts support anxiety.

He‚Äôs interested conversation much he‚Äôs looking rabble rouser complain.

Ask ‚Äúhospitalizations vs. local cases‚Äù theory mask mandate strategy ;) definitely hard public policy choice depends guess burdensome think masks really limited circumstances. lean towards viewing minor inconvenience, though seems like lot people feel differently. Certainly individuals work grocery stores essential locations would find burdensome time.
Perhaps vulnerable people given free n95's governments true protection public places, might acceptable public policy alternative. gladly take booster.  Heard immunity means virus can't sustain community spread.

Vaccines probably reduce chance getting sick due exposure 90%. risk exposure depends precautions amount community infection.

Community infection rates vary radically though. height outbreaks chance run someone infectious could 1 20. lull could 1 1000.

I think high enough rate vaccinations US keep virus low levels without precautions. really boggles mind people get downvoted asking FDA approval long term effects, like thing youre allowed mindlessly scream GET VACCINATED!!!!1!21! We're bad, promise


That said, half family dipsticks. hate it.    likely hospitalized die contract covid vaccination. never said 100% chance would get Covid. It‚Äôs like birth control, 95% effective use birth control anyway YES

Best case would next spring. Worst case would seasonally return masks fall winter we've generally reached herd immunity time develop seasonal vaccine much like flu booster vaccine new variants develop. 

Wearing mask certainly comparable giving vehicles planes. Wearing mask would comparable simple precautions seat belts airbags.  understand even case, take 10 years equally know virus vaccine cause long term?

I understand people absolutely concerned vaccine time apathetic virus.

The key part pick large venue. picked biggest one, vaccinate 10.000 per day huge. literally 20 square meters (1 300 feet)

It felt like safest place earth. nurses super friendly, first time birthday week said happy birthday asked wanted change arm (Instead left arm picked right I'm left handed) 

Perhaps tell perhaps someone else lives close recommend specific venue. Getting vaccinated difficult buying milk. Immunocompromised ah, yes please. America like communist dictatorship. would solve problems mild symptoms; rest none all. weeks diagnosis, 19% reported still least one symptom: loss smell, cough, fatigue, weakness, difficulty breathing, muscle pain. Nine employees ‚Äì 23% ‚Äì healthy enough return work 10 days required quarantine. One gone back six weeks.

So 19% 3% long COVID symptoms... small portion small portion. worried, could try get 3rd shot boost antibodies. study shows lower antibodies associated breakthrough infection. think big question is: also reduce risk long covid? ""herd immunity"" fairy tale.. Testing, masks quarantine way beat covid, otherwise keep mutating eventually destroys humanity know it. people do, there's difference moral grandstanding work mind asking? Thanks answer! 

Is concern vaccinated people could become risk delta variants future? since beginning actually. vaccinated-only offices closing.

This bullshit. companys might employee safety, others said, getting sued. worried getting forcing people vaccinated. covering asses make sure get sued unsafe work environments.

Over last year corprate America showed think enployees disposable. Policies requiring vaccines office great, forget normal people conpanies share motivations. telling vaccinated (read:PROTECTED) people live there's vaccine

They didnt tell that.

They said indoors area high risk, wear mask. not, free face. understand part throughout pandemic, CDC banked hard extreme caution issuing public health guidance. scientific community always required preponderance empiricism declaring anything advisable do. However, culture well general public, bit attuned nuance typical scientist, lives world exact standards peer review. feel CDC filtering guidance issued result scientific discoveries behavioral experts including disclaimers guidance guidance, directive. 

Of course best course action get vaccinated, wear mask, socially distance, etc. safest advice however, take account cannot simply stop people living lives virus several effective vaccines available fatality rate less 2%, lower. 

The pandemic made mockery public health authorities people scientific community yet realize it. 

I'm frustrated CDC preponderance towards excessive caution excessive flip-flopping (except matter, like beginning pandemic, said masks needed). agency joke hope Government Accountability Office Health Human Services Inspector General looks closely CDC's guidance development process. behind paywall. someone copy TLDR get tested? work retail I'm really worried immune compromised partner car dangerous potentially deadly others. 50,000 year die car accidents. 

Yeah, last year half 600k+ dead COVID US compared 50k-75k deaths car accidents. COVID killed LOT time span. 

But besides that, throw hands declare ""oh well, life risk, lets anything reduce car fatalities."" say ""well, I'm wearing seat belt, anything else."" 

Instead, cars GREAT example laws, regulations, rules, enforcement using science reduce fatalities.

Here's partial, off-the top head, list things prevent car injuries:

* seat belts; 
* speed limits; 
* stop signs; 
* stop lights; 
* speed bumps; 
* car registration; 
* licensing; 
* eye tests; 
* safety civil engineering roads; 
* DUI's; 
* checkpoints DUI's; 
* insurance; 
* insurance points; 
* driver's education; 
* recalls; 
* airbags; 
* enforcement like tickets; 
* antilock breaks; 
* crumple zones; 
* air tires squeegees gas stations; 
* age limits; 
* red light cameras; 
* windshield wipers headlights; 
* car seats young children Next lap, share car three infected drivers doesn‚Äôt catch Covid first line. isn‚Äôt anti-vaxx sub you‚Äôve seen you‚Äôre creating issue. You‚Äôre extreme positions ruined credibility. Good know small minority . see news ""Thousands gather London protest vaccines"" assume that's case throughout country. ""B-b-but endgame *we create one!*"" - anti-sci–µnce sk–µptics Delta variant joke fact is, lot people working home fine last year immunocompromised family and/or children 12 cannot vaccinated yet.

While absolutely awful variant upending ""reopening"" narrative proving we're quite woods yet time... silver lining LOVE, LOVE, LOVE truth regarding ""lets get back office"" bullshit viciously exposed nothing result middle management egos, resistance new ways, supporting business models work worked years.

For instance, ""commuting Manhattan model"" would take upwards two hours way using abysmal NJ Transit system... 18 MILES. 18 F'king miles would sometimes take 3 hours MANY days like February 2020, WFH implemented.

NJ Transit never gave enough damn improve literally anything, easiest communication, riders BEGGED pre-pandemic, they're sending surveys every day would make come back.

I rode ONCE... one damned time since March 2020, problems May took single trip see might want go back commuting get house renting cheap office Manhattan.

Nope. would done it... commute took reasonable expect 30-40 minutes instead 90-120. Yeah, would problem solved! Feeling bit depressed today. 

My workplace reinstated mask mandate employees. recent policy fully vaccinated employees didn‚Äôt need mask. many anti-vax employees flouting rules new CDC guidance, things restricted again.

I‚Äôm sure go here. thought masking + social distancing slow spread order buy time develop distribute vaccine. apparently 50% workplace won‚Äôt get it. So, don‚Äôt get point. 

All anti-vax people doomed get infected. Masks slow process bit. really anti-vax people don‚Äôt care wearing masks/social distancing either.

So‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt get it. we‚Äôre hardcore mandating highly incentivizing vaccines, end game? feel like everything went 2020 didn‚Äôt matter absolutely gut punch taste freedom again, setback morons causing numbers rise. CDC accept people going listen matter happens. pissed again, importantly, pissed vaccinated people actually listened guidelines; put frontline workers crappy position harassed assaulted trying enforce mandate; like said, service industries started opening back going suffer. emotional health going tolerate much this. also prescribed 1vermectin people (I'll get banned this, lol) explained sister, cognitive dissonance best all. Ignoring psychology behind losing 100$ much psychologically harmful getting 100$ first place, also idea household budgets. People plan current finances mind, ideally. people plan legal fines mind. Imposing fines would really hurt barely scrape by. I'm honestly sure arrive ""they're functionally thing"" when, mind, they're functionally opposites. one complain government fining personal choices. personal choices get bonus not. fining office workers give highly productive ones bonus? can't think single salesman would agree you. like saying ""giving higher tips good waitresses fining bad ones"" EU's fault Astrazeneca can't even run vaccine trial properly. numbner non-EU countries problems Astrazeneca's figures; US Switzerland starters. chose manufacture knowing would make profit. didn‚Äôt to.

It becomes painfully clear every day. mind it‚Äôs test. 

Either refuse vaccine admit Trump/Tucker/Hannity wrong. you‚Äôre vaccinated (and immunocompromised), you‚Äôre well protected severe disease right now. CDC concerned even though vaccinated people getting mild cases, they‚Äôre still shedding virus thus getting aren‚Äôt vaccinated vulnerable sick. evidence still seems slightly questionable rate vaccinated infecting others. Hence mask recommendation everyone. 

We‚Äôre several weeks/months behind countries hit hard Delta (India, UK, Netherlands, Indonesia). countries seemed hit hard, quickly. Hopefully we‚Äôll start see sharp downturn Florida cases (where Delta seemed take hold fast US first) follow similar pattern weeks ahead us. assume states go similar spikes point following weeks/months. Hopefully rate severity lessened areas high vaccination rates. hopefully overall vaccinations keep hospitalizations manageable. doctor epidemiologist please correct COMPLETELY flawed thinking.

My husband got Covid last week symptomatic. around first days symptoms, wearing mask. tested positive, tried isolate best could one bedroom apartment. wore masks around 36 hours last fever broke. 

I since tested negative twice yet develop symptoms. still quarantine 7 days. nurse spoke said current protocol situations like partner‚Äôs 10 days ends, incubation period 14 days starts, unless test negative 7 days stay asymptomatic.

Lastly, note husband late twenties, preexisting conditions, fully vaccinated moderna. 

2 questions:

1) still able spread covid? live area high transmission. 

2) masking public, reducing exposure outside world? Avoiding gatherings others due area high transmission? didn‚Äôt get sick husband, feel sense security can‚Äôt imagine situation I‚Äôd get exposure spouse. 

Remove allowed. Thanks. need stop selfish continue wear masks, even vaccinated.

The opportunities virus gets infect vaccinated, higher chances vaccine resistant strains Offering monthly stipend people vaccinated fining functionally thing. downvoted, stand reason viral load higher masks also less effective. protected sense seatbelt protects you. Nothing 100% great protection serious illness.

To give point reference, less vaccinated people hospitalized US last 6 months currently hospital exact moment time FL. sure see. called 6 months get unblinded blood draw go back november (12 months) J&amp;J Agreed. Although think Trump basically destroyed CDC there. like everyone *heard* lockdowns actually go outside check, disingenuous.

Throughout whole pandemic, since March 2020, county accepted reality required masks kids ages 3 up. 2 year olds 2 year olds. daycare center followed this.

And it‚Äôs purely performative even toddlers wear one pull constantly, take nap (guess Covid they‚Äôre asleep magically?)

I‚Äôm fully vaccinated I‚Äôve followed rules whole time I‚Äôm confused angry we‚Äôre even right now. Yes are, repeating lines comments here. ever gave do. Get vaccinated mutates nothing. airborn, masks better masks, doesnt make much difference. caught COVID grocery store everyone around wore masks. 

The masks people use garbage, made cotton. Take puff cigarette exhale mask see nothing really preventing smoke spilling everywhere filtering cloth. masks help bit talking face face someone, air projected directly them, virus still hangs around air afterwards. 

Maybe everyone wore N95 masks goggles, basic cloth masks bought amazon really much something airborn, much harder control spit droplets. It‚Äôs little nuanced that, tbh. India world sh-t *months*. waking nightmare. 

Lifting mitigation measures soon also contributed speed Delta rode roughshod literally everything.

India also almost nonexistent vaccination rate time. 

[Why India‚Äôs Second COVID Surge Much Worse First: Large gatherings much lenient restrictions allowed virus spread devastating researchers media outlets pinned blame new viral variants, early studies suggest may transmissible original strain. many experts familiar situation ground argue large gatherings crowds closed, compact urban spaces‚Äîin contrast draconian lockdown imposed first wave‚Äîare driving Prime Minister Narendra Modi Mamata Banerjee, chief minister state West Bengal, held crowded political campaign rallies state elections India even COVID cases spiking past April.

So there's definitely progress made delta vaccine, point seem widely publicized moment. 

I'm hoping get updates vaccine sort radically expedited approval process. takes year testing red tape every time need create variant-specific boosters, we're going perpetually losing race virus' mutation speed.

We're holding metaphorical door open legally allowed make choices. short: UK politics stupid, they're *that* stupid.... 4 states. 10 states 75-79%. California 76.7% way people vaccinated Ontario. 

These comparisons idiotic. think hospitalization least thousands think instituting mask mandates  there's nu variant?

(Forgive pun!) dude, show class. want apology? I'm sorry offended mistakenly speaking absolutes comforting someone's anxiety. Please forgive me. That's ridiculous. forgot mess Texas was. Things baaaad Louisiana right least governor believes Covid lol run bunch satellite offices five employees each. One office shut employees got covid, Even though vaccines available months. We're considering forcing vaccines another office shut weeks. better chance dying car crash Covid‚Ä¶ everyone scared this? Please inform me

So, statement factualy false. surprising people speak like you.

Updated 6:01 PM EST, Wed November 18, 2020 actually read article would understand indeed strange can't correlated vaccination rate. It‚Äôs anti-vaxxers problem specific case - obviously click-baity headline. ‚ÄúMost Covid deaths England vaccinated - here‚Äôs shouldn‚Äôt alarm you.‚Äù fb post contained article headline verbatim. actual title enough get people riled up, it‚Äôs article, reposters. Hurr hurr! People angry neighbors walking near fires covered gasoline like people angry people dousing gasoline! Hurr hurr! clever! logic, avoid anything could taken extreme.


Speed limits?! Sure save lives make road safer everybody, trust government reduce speed limit 0, thus paralyzing economy?

Lower drinking age 18? Sure allow everything else 18, trust government lower age 12? 

Sell marijuana legally? want anybody age able buy weed alongside candy bars vending machines consume everywhere? 


I'm sick people saying can't anything ""slippery slopes"". bullshit argument. law, measure idea taken extreme, still need get shit done. Everything exists spectrum. ever notice one argument either? Yes. Moral integrity. Refusing responsible others pandemic moral failing‚Ä¶ Hm why, 6 days sound realistic? IIRC likely days infection show symptomps day 3-4, give another 2 days reporting get approximately 3 US states reached 80% combined population little half Ontario's.

2 provinces 1 territory Canada 80% right now. Yukon blown park nearly 95%. Yes, Japanese government can, won't. financial reasons, nationalistic pride. tied first total gold medals. Mandating masks vaccination silly. 

Are shutting indoor restaurants well? Yep, guess. maybe refrain They'll require vaccination, fine. like last year. Yes delta does. see re-infection breakthrough vaccine. immunity previous strain covid, something slightly different going around. probably fight lot quicker stay hospital immune system kind idea do.

At end day, covid problem. problem hospitalizations deaths. vaccine infection acquired immunity previous strain provides significant hospitalization protection future strains, we're far I'm concerned.     Well, there's accountability you, ya weirdo! guy must spin wheel predictions every morning mainstream media covers whatever hits. body , choice  Risky. tell lie like can‚Äôt undo it. big company meetings events. Maybe put health insurance employment status risk. produce vaccination card see you‚Äôve lying year plus avoid showing up.
. great situation in. agree. feel there's self-reporting bias (where people willing report data something actually happens), along flat lying push agenda online.  soft lockdown

There nothing ever soft lockdown. implemented again, sever jugular US economy world. line what‚Äôs expected.  told ya agree never said that. Im actually still glad vaccinated [Israeli Data Suggests Possible Waning Effectiveness Pfizer Ministry Health took another look

It‚Äôs like putting bandaid cracked pipe. Yes, virus. remember couple months ago raised concern vaccine passports assured thread ‚Äúthey‚Äôll never happen‚Äù lots people saying it.

A couple months ago people proposing theme. much now.  periods fall last year hospital I‚Äôm employed ‚Äúoverwhelmed‚Äù. solved issue diversions outlying facilities reached capacity.

Well supposed it? aren‚Äôt going force morons vaccinated it‚Äôll never end.  watched tutorial make Facebook clone. Zuck worth million lifetimes worth cash something basically took hours get going. Crazy.  [Just true, way stopping it.

That's true though. Fewer cases means fewer opportunities mutation, achieved vaccination, social distancing, masking etc. actionable warning. Yes, I‚Äôm living one. It‚Äôs bad. Shocking I'm Illinois Governor (who took restrictive heavy approach too) made sort mandate announcement stating state adopted CDC guidance. means practice remains seen. statewide adjustment made since CDC announcement yesterday require government buildings. funny I've heard dozen breakthrough cases, personally. must know lot people!  right, tell us Moderna's specific benefit. People usa gotta get vaccinated Ignoring different technology 1952, mRNA coronavirus vaccines developed studied years. great surprise SARS virus finally got away, scientists working vaccine tech handle outbreak quite pandemic seemed inevitable. 

In fact, far along first sars-cov-2 mRA vaccine already plugged ready test month U.S. entered first lockdowns.  4,100 people *miracle*. many unvaccinated people hospitalized Maybe stupid undisciplined people die take serious. Ban part problem too. I'd concerned spreading children 12. care one bit unvaccinated adults. hopefully soon 12 vaccinated wont worry either. irrelevant point. Yep. saw today like, happened claims following research documentation experience ‚Äúopened up‚Äù.

Just decided cowboy yee-haw cliff guess. 

Taking approach ‚Äúif don‚Äôt know cases, can‚Äôt report cases‚Äù. 

Inclined get third vaccine rate could find pharmacist willing it, case (AZ &amp; Pfizer here, expecting get another Pfizer eventually anyway travel etc). Rinderpest. AAP data last week actually scary article it‚Äôs worth  frustrating. Yeah think someone else's decision make. 

And plus vaccinated people still spread virus. I‚Äôm pretty sure rhinoviruses unlimited potential mutate, that‚Äôs finding treatments vaccines colds difficult. remember raised concern vaccine passports assured thread ‚Äúthey‚Äôll never happen‚Äù lots people saying it. 

Forcing people take vaccine going work. I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre going live people getting vaccinated, people stupid. Welcome human race. end game enough people resistant risk overwhelming hospitals minimal. 

It seems CDC thought spike would result many hospitalizations however, increasing unsustainable rate. Overwhelmed hospitals good society regardless vaccinated not.  It‚Äôs really odd I‚Äôm pretty far left live FL. thought okay governor. Can‚Äôt love everything someone don‚Äôt really think Mitch McConnell Florida. covid rolls around dude fucking nut EVERYTHING touches. Yep‚Ä¶ going be‚Ä¶ yet üòâ That‚Äôs necessarily true. There‚Äôs movement towards remote work tech long time second one? to, LOL okay, we'll see. Governors salivate mouth impose lockdowns hold power get hands on. know trusted. motivation lie? interesting vast majority population vaccinated. Hey man understand concern I'm way concerned kids catching thing logistics job.

I'm risking getting hospitalized long covid. Hospitalizations jumped 168% according article. horror show common colds rhinovirus, Corona. Godamnit. Universal last weekend. I'm vaccinated I'm *too* worried *a lot* people crammed together there. find difficult believe numbers would change quickly. said, Israel generally followed 21 day interval doses several months since fully vaccinated, situation seems far analogous US either UK Canada. really need better understanding data. know random strangers elevator checkout next table restaurant infected?  I'm fully vaccinated wondering....

And breakthrough infections ""rare"" cdc says last time looked couple days ago seems strange want every vaccinated person could come contact infected person go get tested wear mask anyway... I'm ever accused crime, alibi ""I reading home"" difficult prove. 48% US population fully vaccinated. People still getting sick dying. Decent society wants end.   /r/im14andthisisdeep  odds low vaccinated getting long Covid Ok. I‚Äôll bring whole dental practice house Jesus, slow walking us back lockdowns aren‚Äôt they. messaging seems familiar: wasn‚Äôt issue was. never end. got vaccinated. thought right protect myself.

The solution work home like last year don‚Äôt want come across red-hatted anti-masker.

Nobody rational thinks clearly didnt read article OP posted. Whose lazy one? stating facts vaccine undermining it. Wanting lie facts people trust it. It‚Äôs awful. 

It also basically removes power employers send people sick home ‚Äúquarantine‚Äù due symptoms, positive contact, positive test themselves, going one going home ones DGAF go work? ones ones cautious entire time likely vaccinated can‚Äôt really claim ‚Äúsick days‚Äù however long takes actually positive coworker low risk infecting others (or hospitalized) etc. Meanwhile, transmission rates increasing again‚Ä¶

I think booster shots future. I‚Äôm trying rude, but, small kids? daughter (3) great wearing mask. niece (6) terrible. understand need person learning half measures clearly don‚Äôt work. Hey know study BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine aka BioNTech let‚Äôs careful using study make action America doesn‚Äôt use vaccine

I‚Äôm saying you‚Äôre wrong let‚Äôs use proof definitely use exact reduction blanket statement vaccines Tech companies first WFH mandates. Fortune 500 follows lead. Acute myocarditis identified small percentage taking mRNA Covid19 vaccine, Pfizer Moderna. take J&amp;J 1-dose vector vaccine instead. I'm expert, memory original Covid strain children really danger getting seriously ill. could pass virus onto vulnerable adult like grandparent, thought kids likely safe. appears that's case anymore. 

As another year remote learning realistic, think many parents would prefer rolling dice children's lives. Lesser two evils. made excellent choice getting vaccinated, masks that's another layer protection. Good deal. mention long covid data shows 19 30 percent still symptoms months later..that includes kids cases mild asymptomatic covid.. never said did. others have, general comment. Interesting point. wonder stretching September could actually make things worse schools start there's relatively high case rate, creating opportunity spread widely among unvaccinated students. know, everyone ‚Äúfinish line.‚Äù me, it‚Äôs youngest child eligible vaccine. that, I‚Äôll probably keep I‚Äôm doing, I‚Äôll rest easier knowing we‚Äôre ‚Äúmostly protected.‚Äù It‚Äôs hard feel like we‚Äôre good place then.  Agreed! Learning lifelong process anyway! Right- needs narrative deal it. think people afraid getting majorly impacting lives, point need learn move on. point public stop thinking covid? Sort like flu...we society make major changes social interactions flu season, accept similar risk handling covid on? know answers. I'm sick dealing covid measures. I'm vaccinated, healthy, kids young vaccinated healthy. wearing mask little move past pandemic I'm tired life general impacted group people refusing get vaccinated. need either address problem not, stop making affect people done right thing.

Psi variant give us powers? take account Alpha variant right? prominent Pfizer trials. Obviously, Delta variant change number, doubt 10% drop entirely due waning immunity alone. talking about? pretty easy see waves peak roughly 6-7 weeks micro scale (on size states). absolutely reasonable think end august, states started rising 3 weeks ago peaking. already 38,000. 83,000 one doubling. week two. So, vaccines today specifically target spike protein, function properly mutates way attaching ACE2 surface proteins.

This region highly conserved part, reached peak fitness Delta variant infectious due vaccine inefficiency, subtle tweaks surface protein evolves.

I believe likely mutate complete escape variant. also believe exposed Delta sometime next 6 months given fast spreading, immune response sharpen method handling it, making well-rounded response.

When look fully vaccinated people killed virus, small number, overwhelming majority 70+ years old. One thing 70 year old longer produce new naive T-Cells great quantities, thymus basically gone point. response b-cell response w/ antibodies.

Younger people T-Cell second line attack promotes swift end new infections. T-Cell response little generalized antibodies might almost threshold neutralizing virus t-cells still going step up.

And that's future SARS-ncov19 infections likely like cold. somehow mutate point existing vaccines existing antibodies recognize all, we'll boosters much closer new highly fit variant (fit meaning ability successfully thrive, measure fat virus is) Yeah man! said quick overview immune system!

One, getting sick basically equivalent getting slightly less effective vaccine kill instead giving headache day. people get sick, population gains immunity less people virus infect.

Two, cases increase, people notice change behavior. South Dakota peaks troughs like every state, despite government implementing restrictions. (Their peaks *were* higher huge amount unnecessary death, though).

Three, cases increase, people notice get vaccinated. This, course, much good short term, 5 weeks people immunity. Vaccinations ticked last week this. True. Thankfully hospital patients staff undergrads almost never cross paths. need flatten curve we're danger exceeding healthcare capacity. right aren't.

Instead prolongs pandemic undermines public confidence vaccine. dumb results. trends UK perplexing would bet chance flatten curve restrictions kept freedom day removal restrictions 9 days ago starting catch going trend upwards again.

Just 2 cents could wrong. ban sugar. Way simpler. bet cumshot_josh insightful Reddit too. Usually skills transferable. Yeah, sounds like Florida. Like before, hospitals overwhelmed need things slow down. also lot unvaccinated people *aren't* intractably stubborn, get vaccine right circumstances. we're seeing right now! Vaccines way way places experiencing outbreaks, ideally, we'd slow things give time build immunity.

All said, core point, actually agree. Eventually let things go. think result massive outbreak. slow burn, definitely, 100%. catastrophe. many places around country, hope people ignore mask stuff keep living lives. That's intend do, anyway. didn‚Äôt mean didn‚Äôt know personally. idea possibility flu all. corrected myself. matters dying unchanged.

What matters preventing transmission shows waning- become apparent anecdotally past weeks gives data.

Both matter. What‚Äôs endgame? always certain percentage population susceptible disease, covid otherwise. Always. burden shift susceptible disease protect themselves? Society whole can‚Äôt restricted forever small subset people can‚Äôt get vaccine refuse care personal health. 

Yes sounds selfish, it‚Äôs reality. Abortions literally stop human life though, right? It‚Äôs incredible selfish people suggesting would mandate drug still emergency use. 37-199 pediatric flu deaths US year. children (along survive) end ventilators. question posed actual number kids ventilators time. know kids ever ventilator due flu mean happen. stupidity

Maybe shouldn‚Äôt recklessly encouraged decades. own/get nothing happy. crazy growth? could lead sort indirect ways like insurance companies charging unvaccinated - substantially more. Mandating vaccines private business employees possibly customers. 

Although seems like it‚Äôs taking dark path, pandemics end, matters soon. Admissions deaths lag cases, cases dropped last week So, crowd fully vaccinated people spread COVID easily already protection infection. control

This Q way saying 'I'm schizotypy spectrum.' NYC here. $100 literal chump change indigent. nearly enough payout change many minds.

If DeBlasio serious getting people take vaccine, he'd France done: bar unvaxxed people restaurants, bars, theatres, music venues, etc. good friend runs vaccine clinic Harlem, tells reason people cite getting shot want sit vaxxed section Yankee Stadium. know peaking, looks like cases still trending world meter (not busting balls, seriously asking). I'd support vaccination mandates. 

The main difference viruses contagious (thus affecting public health), abortions aren't. 

Obviously there's lot nuance subject, that's much want get reddit comment. Yes, understand that.

My point disagree that, point there‚Äôs reason can‚Äôt federal covid database. doesn‚Äôt inherently disagree either statements. Rather force states anything, allow states **or** individuals opt in. would change nothing statements. would allow states want, rules.

If places require proof vaccination, people look digital passport options rather carry card around. states anything avoid offering one, would give individuals states option‚Ä¶ also may push people get vaccinated long run. I‚Äôve never heard kids ventilator flu. That‚Äôs messed up.  N95s logic doesn‚Äôt really flesh out

Oh go. Wait liar moron? Mr pseudo intellectual philosopher.

Ah is, culminating name calling. Gee, you‚Äôve given quite choice here.

Let‚Äôs go nothing else say you. last word.  took four months winter wave peak. this? hey last one. they'll call different virus name like Covid-22  Cubs White Sox hosting 30-40,000 fans almost **daily** months Chicago already. think music festival requires vaccination going change much. literally mask mandates businesses anything Floridians would care about. Vaccine mandates look little stronger it‚Äôs clear article masks apply anything else.  precedent from? basis claim ""viruses evolve bypass immune system tend become less deadly""?

My understanding belief comes entirely theory ""a virus kills host fast many chances spread hosts"".

But coronavirus spreading nonlinearly mostly pre-symptomatically, think SARS-CoV-2 subject pressure.

More link. Can't law also repealed next election.  CDC already recommending everyone get vaccinated. they're trying use masks instead. addition too. Waning antibodies levels mean waning immunity. need shit ton data lot longer understand efficiency time real world settings.

It really matter though- muggles care either way. Absolute numbers meaning context. That's 2 nurse friends work ICU local told well.   


I""m sure ..... numbers / % low. They‚Äôll tell need every 6 months, rest life! Enjoy! Maybe thought it, would stop it. one asking lock indoors, sensible precautions widespread vaccination keep spreading. don‚Äôt think it, continue spread mutate. would cool.

I'm tad concerned Omega variant. 1- much contagious obviously.
2- older population vaxxed take cautious measures, less social etc. 
3- Younger people socially active, less cautious, exposure virus. Yep. think business stayed quiet waiting vaccines best could, vaccines look decent solution I'm sure see wheels turning. Venues lot money stake want get shutdown and/or sued. want go back half capacity either. 

Why use every safety measure avoid losing money?  Curious see results Florida counting non resident cases deaths. numbers way higher reported. Cases also way vertical uptick winter many tourists people staying in. week last month cases fell. look previous data cases drop rise times peaks actually come fruition. able actually test many cases mean there. projections also put high side scale. low side 30k. Florida peaked 20k fast approaching number soon week numbers come out.  permanently lost credibility moment said that. like Trump-level statement. stage we‚Äôre talking new vaccines though, it‚Äôs literally third dose thing everyone already got. agree variant-specific new vaccine future. world 100% vaccination, Covid worse flu. Obviously won‚Äôt get it‚Äôs worth staying article speculation people really want hear truth - vaccines work you‚Äôre vaccinated go back life normal. Yes indoor county facilities. article clearly mentions apply businesses. vaccine part never disputed. mask mandate part misleading. *useless*. check effectiveness delta, check effectiveness previous variants, make reasonable extrapolation there. conclusive ofc, far useless.

Are people forgetting delay people getting infected delay testing reporting? year, folks.

Median still 4-5 days symptoms UK 5-7 day delay due actually running tests weekend delays. 

The likely increase cases -big mild, left seen- UK's ""Freedom Day"" 19th likely going come around Friday Monday. 

This fear mongering, biological logistical challenges. Wait Friday Monday let's hope trend continues. However, keeping eye UK certain cases go up. Including among vacinated. mean, late, vaccinated catching Covid anyways, albeit majority folks tend plus 60 set. Thank that. Got teary-eyed. I've known say ""the science"" time time. easier saying ""the current body scientific research literature"" goddamn always. scientist, CDC stop caring people think. live someone got flu would death sentence. Wow, things getting serious.

At matter time virus escapes current vaccines.

Canada may need build wall make Trump, uhh Biden pay it. vaccine works doesn‚Äôt

This question more. vaccines work. So...how saying vaccine impact viral load? like saying still get pregnant birth control, must mean birth control impact chances getting pregnant. one way pretend covid numbers low, get rid tests. Funny, think I've heard one someone. ""don't take COVID seriously"" post, anti 
""this headline"" post. ""some""? 2 2000? headline, article, there's numbers given. numbers important, risk tolerances important, numbers withheld, can't make risk assessments. 

Parents make risk assessments activities allow children time. let kid ride bicycle, make wear helmet. parents let kids play football, others make (safer) sports instead. comes COVID, need numbers know ""am sending kid back person classes not."" there's risk there, without numbers know less risky letting ride bike school. 

Any kid dying tragedy. kid dying COVID bigger tragedy kid getting hit car riding bike. riding bike, we're given information need know think exercise sense independence bike gives child worth trade-off.  mother young got polio vaccine still remembers whole family, mean actually everyone town, going local high school get it. huge event people filled relief get vaccine. believe early actually used live polio vaccines which, think covid vaccine scary, live polio vaccine even scarier since potential could contract polio it. Yet people lined vaccine without hesitation sense celebration even.

Even though young, mother remembers father's extreme fear would get polio, stayed whole life. Nearly 70 years later, remembers happy father children vaccinated safe polio. think far many people nowadays become complacent understand faced deadly diseases past, vaccines considered godsend.  think need look happened India see it‚Äôs flu. Estimated death toll Covid 3 1/2 5 million good chunk delta. course part due health care system able handle delta surge, show devastating be. believe I‚Äôm still explain 16 months. Lmao rich getting J&amp;J  Yes lower income households substantially lower vaccination rates. question actually low income separate reason? personally believe vast majority US basically removed access real barrier point. Lower income people likely fall vaccine conspiracies reasons much income. alpha yes, delta, jury still out. 

We know delta worse. 


A kid hospital ""good"" thing. Especially people can't bothered mask.


A happy healthy kid good covid run around shaming people wearing masks fear flu we?


Because we've flu vaccines years. 500,000 deaths year regular flus.



We lots laws rules prevent far fewer deaths. Even injuries.


People whined cried seatbelt laws way years ago.  likely won‚Äôt called to. ‚Äúmandate‚Äù article refers doesn‚Äôt apply businesses anything would guess care about. 'Freedom Day' pretty tiny change grand scheme things. nightclubs opening mask mandates dropping, largely voluntarily followed anyway. Changes May June way bigger, people living normally couple months. [cases Scotland last two days row, too.](http://imgur.com/a/U461aQS)

And went Wednesday Thursday last week well.

And Wednesday Thursday week that.

And... Oh, wait, mean might trends within given week even overall infection rate falling? Who'd thought. like we've year half anything.  ""dramatic"". agenda coming cabal ID everyone. SCOTUS precentent making vaccinations compulsory, penalty fine. could happen US work now? Seems losing efficacy time goes on, delta variant penetrating higher rate variants, FDA CDC sitting asses approving boosters. put eggs vaccine basket. Sanitizing shopping carts, phone, etc necessary either?

Just keep sanitizing washing hands, masking public, keeping unwashed/sanitized fingers mouth, nose eyes, etc? 

This shit terrifies me. husband fit, fully vaccinated, we're 55, still scares me. want feed fears based media outlet suggest look black fungus India plague resurfacing Colorado. always something new Google employs 144k + people worldwide. Offices US. jobs quite frankly unicorn gigs terms pay benefits. value job Apple, Google, Facebook, Netflix made similar announcements today. Lollapalooza.

Funny considering border opens Canada. I‚Äôd love go Walgreens pretend like need first (3rd) shot. Even look US, way. 60k cases day, deaths remained relatively flat. Worst case scenario, cases may slightly up, proportional cases like was. hit 90k August. Nope. happening. I‚Äôm vaccinated think I‚Äôm putting mask you‚Äôre crazy. I've trying find cause UKs comparatively low cases. one clear answer, guidance vaccines different places. 

Could luck ""hospitals overwhelmed"" citation needed CDC admitting vaccines don‚Äôt work? I‚Äôm trying understand hope accomplish type messaging. forget Alpha (UK)! careful comparison anti vaccine types. Seatbelts permanent masks meant be. link? Actually, world hads moved covid. Google allowing unvaccinated employees return office, also delayed office reopening. Ditto Apple.  


Expect decision big guys lend cover companies same. Even EOE said lawsuits mask vaccine mandates go ""nowehere"".

You going see plenty people given choice continued employment ($$) masking/vaccinating.

Which means job openings people want get ""in"" companies.

And, highly doubt sitmulus money coming \*individuals\*.

Most good jobs want keep them. lol... 18 months later...  nice hobbies. You‚Äôll never bored, continue age. relative 93 sewing keep mind hands busy. Certainly. clusters still essential work? need pay essential workers stay home. also ramp vaccinations they're it. people ‚Äú promised x z got vaccine, fair!‚Äù almost sound like bots point tbh least we‚Äôll never worry facial recognition surveillance. Cosmetic dentistry might take hit, though. run 99's here.

1) 99% died COVID-19 **unvaccinated**. numbers published changed. 

It different yesterday immediate future.

2) 99% time someone asks question words use ""vaccinated"" ""unvaccinated"" supposed assume asking about?
 
 
They asking 3 things.

1) Numbers 2) vaccinations 3) unvaccinated.

I pointed numbers are. idea hidden context 'vaccination rate hospitalized' looked numbers months, realistic ""read in"" words question there.

If wants ask ""how go hospital vaccinated"" answer was, **will less 0.5%.**

Period. great things start honestly. I'd put Hogan Maryland, much reasonable lot things.

Then covid happened latched anti mask hysteria. get freedom bit, he's really put pickle there. He's good comes maintaining electorate effectively governing. ..That's saying. longer vaccinate eliminate CV become ever present. Suck hear this. Stay safe.  Japan too.(I got Pfizer tho) Trauma time commutes long lines anything like that? Fuck want back please absolutely better last year! addition getting everyone vaccinated, really consider shutting things again.  found quarantine completely brought inner introvert. used want go alll tiiime!! Like really needed apart it. absolutely desire. Everything need like home. don‚Äôt want leave bubble.  We‚Äôve gone far we‚Äôve come full circle It‚Äôs really bad south, where, guess what, they‚Äôre refusing vaccines like it‚Äôs job. sympathy anybody except healthcare workers. Nearly 3% medical workers new Israeli study contracted COVID-19 even though vaccinated, 19%¬†of still symptoms six weeks later.

Wow.. Well, I'm glad stop masking. Doubt it. case Pandemic, various government leaders, fragmented, decision lockdown/facemasks federal (for example) easily shot state/local.

They‚Äôve ample time take expert medical advice protect themselves. risk family going change much - I‚Äôm responsible keeping unvaccinated people hospital.

There‚Äôs decent number people upset think better take heed here, stop questioning results - look details it, take look raw data. meantime, err side caution collect data. CDC needs recording breakthrough cases, hospitalized ones.  I've seen much doom, gloom, fear comments recently, please remember: **the vaccines still work incredibly well**.

161,000,000 Americans fully vaccinated.

Of those, [&lt;6,000 died (that's rate 0.0037%).

Vaccines way this.  Well hopefully they'll still end paying back then. Everyone‚Äôs waiting this. data interesting.  developed nations, yeah remember people forgo essential care last year? Hospitals area shut almost nonessential procedures covid cases monopolized care. I'm also introvert (caused PTSD)but found getting outside thinking intentionally forced keep inside.(No lockdown Japan,with constitutionally reason)

Now I'm back regular introvert. flatten curve‚Äî2 weeks I'm surprised insurance companies general raising rates who've avoided getting Vaccine.. make pay smoke?  saw following much often, Moderna Pfizer basically stats.

This time around don‚Äôt give shit staying home wearing mask absolute bare minimum. I‚Äôm vaccinated, need work rebuild business live fucking life. Anyone who's taken biology highschool knows this

Get vaccinated stop giving disease time mutate glad flu negative RNA virus Sar-Cov-2 positive RNA virus. nightmare Flu Corona hybrid. It‚Äôs frustrating, feels like real ‚Äúend‚Äù anymore, since vaccine *supposed* finish line. Even seeing high-vaccinated places spikes worrying frustrating. Well healthcare system around many covid patients day pretty safe assume large % exposed I'm wearing mask either. I'm done it. Could worse, could Taco Bells ball pits. Im introvert too, got first date... fuck right? Think hit Texas? got work thing don‚Äôt really want go to. Uh yes answer get vaccinated significantly reduce chances getting virus post covid symptoms 1.5 years equivalent tiktok video length? Come on. Eradicate virus. Ya know, like polio, smallpox, etc. Honestly wouldnt allowed anyone non vaccinated close would thrown mother law. agree, worldwide effort. there's excuse act accordingly. got vaccinated hope right think it. dont data effective really majority vaccinated people probably Careful unvaccinated. Lot people seem understand say care whatever group general population much says them. Like ok, humanity, go broadcasting that. know there's data / thinking J&amp;J + 1 P/M shot vs. J&amp;J + 2P/M shots?

I got J&amp;J scheduled 2 Moderna boosters. Unsure second required / recommended though. local elections important national! History always repeats itself, people never learn. I‚Äôm actually sure, haha‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve seen several studies positive results pointed towards affording benefit. see either would case, however. know Regeneron works, however, would lean towards believing benefit, although obviously likely best applied someone far along disease progression wind ICU somewhere.

In event, using underscore main point: impacts long-lasting memory cells SARS-like coronaviruses. fault really situation dynamic. I‚Äôm following CDC bullshit anymore. part getting vaccinated wearing mask religiously. get Covid give someone unvaccinated tough shit. part wait till flu season, pretty sure Flu + Delta = Death. clear figures degree medical workers exposed virus (factoring PPE, safeguards, etc), 3% number tell us much. Clearly, vaccines offer protection, given breakthrough occurs, 1 5 chance long COVID great. I'm particularly concerned cognitive psychological effects long COVID seen much information risk symptoms among vaccinated.  CDC needs put shit together. masks needed, masks needed, vaccinated need wear masks, vaccinated need masks indoors, knows next.

I always wear masks indoors since last March got vaccine soon avaiable. able get booster shot? don‚Äôt think Delta Variant isn‚Äôt going away anytime soon. Yep! Someone know hospital virus, followed everything fully vaccinated. young too. billions people world won‚Äôt get vaccinated years? hundred million people nothing compared that. Yes many exposed? number doesn‚Äôt really much unless know many exposed. thing is... get third booster wait better third booster Delta don‚Äôt think many reveling, think many fresh fucks give willful ignorance. 

Indifference think people experiencing. got wrong. ‚Äúwave‚Äù started cities high vaccination rate couldn‚Äôt ‚Äúfind‚Äù unvaccined adults risk. denominator need use mid-July vaccination rate country‚Äôs average. It‚Äôs like trying put seatbelt accident. Probably invested Big Ventilator. symptoms actually long term side effects vaccines? It‚Äôs black white. U.S. expect many employers business require either vaccine negative test.  Blame people refuse get vaccine. fucks drag pandemic months another year more. Eventually it‚Äôs going mutate point even vaccine won‚Äôt effective it. I‚Äôm sick shit. Natural selection needs work people clearly logic reason won‚Äôt Wow someone make available free... No. completely missed point. point vaccine india using even effective, thus even approved US European medical establishments. ""breakthrough"" shitty vaccine isnt working first place.  Oh agree, thankful im vaccinated. note wasnt me. Wife got really sick brother law well. vaccinated too. sure low chances are, admittedly small sample size There‚Äôs guidance healthcare workers. think mainly it‚Äôs showing symptoms heavily pushing shots say increase protection, suspicious one person called anti semetic questioning anything Israel vaxxed guy getting tested potentially exposed. I'll get tested maybe symptoms ways, signs good thing. know plague rat warren stepping seeing gross naked faces. saw opportunity make money took it. know people willing pay exist unvaxxed Jack Nicholson yes meme (ironic) someone supposed prove haven‚Äôt vaccinated?

They wearing red baseball cap. people site. here. It‚Äôs genuinely depressing. hope vaccine provided lasted week Phoenix also, got covid first shot, recovered, got second shot, got covid :( finished recovering 75% would hell lot better 30% unmasked us /smh Yes, read CDC site breakthrough numbers anticipated/assumed underreported due don‚Äôt seek medical treatment. yes generally still low. thing think think it‚Äôs like exposed rabies, undergo preventative series exposure, like tetanus vax, injury give shot right there.

So depressing uneducated seem country. agreement Pfizer early receivers vaccine they'd share data. UK/Israel socialized healthcare = data readily accessible streamlined stuff like they're leading charge studies providing insight. 

The nature results fairly negative/upsetting often positive, that's reality it. hospitals full brim though. Toronto overflow neighbouring counties. could certainly worse lockdowns population willing acting take necessary steps (most time).  caught long haul covid fear sells wouldnt dare leave home positive test, realize individuals can't get vaccinated. I'm saying going way get tested 'exposure event' (which, defining these?) going low priority show symptoms. 

The frustration palpable suddenly, lay blame pretty easily feet subset folks choose fear/propaganda science/medicine. harder selfish way, much easier could chalked happenstance chaos. still try! Look wanted norovirus experience, could get Taco Bell take inflatable raft middle large lake. way really experience shits without escape, around people order make happen it'll 1/100 cost. Thank needed! 

Debating friend get vaccinated, tips? want die :/ Oh totally agree. Blows mind many stupid people listening Facebook, YouTube, Fox News Donald Trump get information. Yep!

Moreover, people hospitalized *with* COVID. 20% 6,000 reported breakthroughs people asymptomatic (and presumably hospitalized something else).

The flipside reports hospitals. hospitals underreport, could underreported well (though would anticipate hospitals would extremely good getting breakthrough data CDC).

In event, clear breakthrough hospitalizations/deaths extraordinarily rare. vaccinated, largely safe severe COVID. wonder CDC recommend closing southern border? Florida reports like 4 days week know reason. Even still don‚Äôt understand basic vaccine science works.  google first Seconded. 

My empathy well run dry. clear lot people serious PTSD last year. see CDC lightly recommend vaccinated wear masks indoor, enclosed, crowded areas, well they're autoimmune compromised, jump conclusion we're going back square one 100%. 

This likely worst that's gonna happen, guys. Delta variant wave burn weeks, we'll get full FDA approval sometime next month, vaccine mandates become lot common. uphill here. flu still killing people, A/H1NI caused Spanish Flu, 1977 Russian Flu, 2009 Swine Flu pandemic. Endemic viruses ""Go Away"".

The vaccine wanes efficacy time. Google it.  


So vaccine wanes strength variants get stronger numerous. noticed also ""Soul"" baby kids waiting take Earth...

Guess many figures have?

(Same Mickey) Man, put place. mean, I‚Äôm licensed clinician, you‚Äôve already spent cumulative hours knocking caring loved ones, makes sense you‚Äôd also knock people 2nd (or case time, 3rd) job getting ahead.

I wish best. really sounds like need something good change attitude yours. Yes. never said that. I'm saying quarantining 14 days negative test absurd point vaccinated. person mentioned quarantining, ignoring test result Please realistic. Mandate vaccine ? already talking 3rd boost delta, vaccine 30% world population. New variants already way.

The way stop shut world 3 months vaccine force entire world once. already reached target today (offered solution risk population) feel like recommendation based surplus tests done anyway? vast majority people, especially young, neother die suffer long term effects even don‚Äôt mask, don‚Äôt vaccinate don‚Äôt isolate. marmite fish chips dishes gave away? now...Numbers always start small spiral control. time goes vaccine loses efficacy existing new variants, numbers go again. Good luck convincing percentage Americans got vaccinated first round get booster. Used live there, it‚Äôs shocking different bluish Florida is. People thought India great longest time. Delta hit wasn't. push luck eventually catch you. horror show climax restrictions certain states locations face mass death hospitalization. Frankly im surprised healthcare workers didnt use calm quit. mental fortitude gods. huge social pressure lift mask mandate. Sadly, we're past logic reason.  Moderna dose 3x mRNA dose Pfizer.

That could make bigger response maybe longer one, meaningless extra. heard CNN last night delta think vaccinated people carry strong viral load infectious someone vaccinated. Okay, guess might get sick then. Sucks else done? gonna avoid exposed sometime next 70 years wearing mask. Back square one. sister situation (transplant recipient). Definitely something think about. Thanks sharing. know. thought that. coincidence mutated viruses much transmissible? characteristic needed survive environment created, meaning people making harder viruses transmitted. 

Another way put it... version virus would far likely become dominant people socially distancing wearing masks? coincidence mutated viruses become dominant much transmissible? 

Maybe let first virus run course, variants would thrived people would caught virus already immunity would prevented mutated viruses gaining traction.

But course idea characteristics new mutations be. may even get lucky become less deadly. one knows.  Well zone large chunk crew. 1st AD, camera department, key grip, gaffer, hair makeup, set costumes, set props/set dec, producers, etc.

I've worked 3 levels crew good deal zone A. You‚Äôre also much less likely get infected wear mask Exactly. Here‚Äôs rewrite first paragraph: ‚ÄúNearly 97% medical workers new Israeli study contract COVID-19 vaccinated, 99.5% contract COVID-19 longer six weeks.‚Äù  Yeah. best way prevent transmission wear n95 fits well. Funny facebook requires vaccines platform super spreader misinformation hotspot. Vaccinated people still spread covid. It‚Äôs likely touch, seems you‚Äôre infected even vaccinated you‚Äôre still capable spreading it. think mandates necessary. vaccination high enough, becomes matter protecting oneself instead health care system think saw communication skills CDC director said ""but let go script minute"" proceeded literally read script.  think lot Trump's ""allies"" want base, trump's soft power fades base shrinks loyalty shrink well.

Trump watch back. numbers standpoint, there's breakthrough cases vaccinated adults resulting deaths children 18 died COVID-19. suggests unvaccinated children even lower risk vaccinated adults. think Dr. Malone's statement higher nasal virus titers vaccinated group vs unvaccinated group early indication antibody dependent entrancement (ADE)?

This Bannon War Room episode earlier today. Try triggered, serious question. Science change time -- that's kind works.

Buy science never said take masks public situations, politicians policy pushing that. Lots people I‚Äôm Canada I‚Äôd same! subreddit Covid Positive filled stories like past two months.  Well definitely every business. REALLY enforced. mean that's we're dying here. It‚Äôs infuriating people demand exact date masks stuff go away. Like fuck supposed know shit‚Äôs gonna die down?

This community spread low would noticeable immediately cases went up. Oh boy. whole world running around like chickens heads cut off. also one first countries (maybe first) get majority population vaccinated, they‚Äôre well positioned lot data sooner, too. Breaking winter records *in summer*.

Winter Coming 2.0 going rollercoaster. Employers arrogant. Suddenly employer starting concerned security apparently. 2 years WFH. Suddenly everyone come office. see suffering fate. Cases increase they'd shutdown again. unlucky people timeframe suffer. God forbid someone dies terms healthcare, profit motive discussed enough. I'm sure. Sometimes think he's got way big crush trump that. talking effictiveness preventing hospitalisation death Delta variant one dose Moderna Pfizer 90's, AZ 70's. Basically, even though vaccinated people catching Delta variant, infections less dangerous fewer vaccinated people dying.
 - Page 8. Herd immunity ever mean zero cases.

It means outbreaks die quickly locally rather spending wide. long it‚Äôs free I‚Äôm in. upside living may died. downside shitty couple days. Really brainier comes insurance. would NEVER happen ... /S

IMO bigger stain medical history bloodletting medieval ages. I‚Äôll gladly take booster offer me. I‚Äôm fortunate enough live US know opportunities get vaccine much numerous countries happening summer. Can't wait till Winter Coming Season 2. Many states Bluetooth based apps thing. Yes, even fully vaxxed population virus would spread. Overall hospitalizations/deaths would drastically lower. believe best scenario hope point. 
That + stay vigilant new variants might pose issues vaccines. Maybe take five booster shots condoms every two half years safe side illegals Agreed. What‚Äôs point getting vaccinated still wear mask need tests long. mean somewhat understand now, next year Probably around 50%. That's weird. that's Florida guess. Thanks heads Pre-Delta sterilizing immunity 90% mRNA vaccines. Delta, around mid 60s. leaves pretty big margin still get asymptomatic mild case potentially still spread compared month ago. insurance way comes risk management. nerds, lot info rough take it:

Concerns:

* ""3 nucleotide/1 amino acid insertion Spike protein"" along deletion, truncating gene. Effect both, any, unknown.
* many common Alpha (UK variant) mutations.
* Shares D950N delta, variant so.
* Spike alterations always carry immune escape concern (whether realised not, early say), may compelling advantage immunity variants rises.

Reliefs:

* exploded way delta (which went negligible April 95% June, UK). First detected February, low case counts many countries.

Mixed:

* Colombia never appreciable delta presence, cannot say one outcompetes not.

Florida providing data last dot point category. much to-watch currently, could well fizz vs delta - _don't_ want see, must see, causing harm already delta. watch, now.

If Florida I'd least wearing mask though, interest participant uncontrolled human trials new variant experiences. Im masking again.

Vaccines either work don‚Äôt. Pick one. Personally, step foot ship allowed unvaccinated people it. care pay sit special area? it, they'll still spread it.

We know vaccinated people still catch (a lighter) version Covid, info vaccinted people able spread around? ain‚Äôt never mask mandate. Ummm, article linked post highlights study says vaccines protection serious illness dropped 80%. 

But fact - patients injected long.

This speculative fantasy. said looks like it‚Äôs less 90% now.

The article American medical study. Yale Medical agree findings small country Israel less 400 study, presented government, also predicted tally serious COVID-19 cases Israel could reach high 400, current 145, less three weeks steps taken rein infections.

Where US 650,000 deaths, they're talking 145 cases. angry full time mask wearing? seen new CDC notice? Except Reddit. Mother-in-law vaccinated, Chemo know means immunity. resist urge every day throw caution wind go back normal refuse reason dies. Plus babies can't get vaccinated yet. lot us vaccinated, still loved ones protect.   looks like cases still trending world meter (not busting balls, seriously asking).

Cases started skyrocketing rural parts MO AR weeks ago (can't speak AR). Cases rising MO ramping KC STL metro areas instead rural parts state + Joplin Springfield. overall cases may peaking southwest MO started weeks ago, since lag time spreads, since population MO lives near STL KC, overal totals state whole continue increase even first areas MO started see outbreak plateauing now, makes sense. Stuck red Florida county us trying too. face legal repercussions? law creating PPP program doesn‚Äôt say anything mask requirements. passed, still ‚Äúexperts‚Äù giving conflicting information need masks. think viral loads news today done panic people possibility masks coming back. situation. possible workplace mandate yet forces person.

1. don‚Äôt need exposed gross disease spreading. 
2. They‚Äôre fucking morons. ever hang first place? AstraZeneca great vaccine serious problems scaling production. Also first preliminary phase 3 trial results included little information efficacy groups 65 years, making impossible many countries approve age group. Luckily production stepped know efficacy. 

This article makes point many countries donating AstraZeneca stock - opinion that‚Äôs good news. gotten point millions vaccines sent developing countries countries done vaccinated, speed pick remaining countries. Yeah echo chamber gets old.

Can imagine horrible coward rather *kill children* look bad, appear wrong.

What kind sick fucking society live in? kid immunocompromised would staying home manage fight off, certainly may without lasting consequences. see CDC lightly recommend vaccinated wear masks indoor, enclosed, crowded areas, well they're autoimmune compromised

That light recommendation starts chain reaction results everything fun banned. Well, summed up, like read. Thanks. investigated potential booster shots  one scared. People need grow get vaccine. slows transmission rates kids less likely become infected. 

The ones getting vaccinated fear mongers. ‚ÄúTracking chips‚Äù ‚Äúgovt get me‚Äù ‚ÄúI might bad reaction‚Äù ‚ÄúBill Gates‚Äù etc.  never going good enough. vaccine makes virtually impossible die covid. that's good enough. dream year ago. best thing could possibly happen.  light end tunnel. 

there irony low vaccination rates. people wonder people trust things politicized. time, censor speech topics, gives people less trust media. 

i vaccinated. anything going make shy away vaccine, would censorship subject. wonder New Zealand going start building wall‚Ä¶maybe ring fire‚Ä¶.some buoys something‚Ä¶.*sigh*

Gotta envy New Zealand times like these. Would love over, I‚Äôm sure y‚Äôall would like well. 

Please get vaccinated let‚Äôs get lives. I'm half mast happens offices Florida whatever batshit crazy states governors forbid vaccine requirements? I‚Äôm one living false reality? live SF infections lowest entire country‚Ä¶you know why? highest vaccination rate

You realize reason delta variant widespread low vaccination rate enabled Covid continue spread mutate‚Ä¶.

If people gotten vaccinated, delta variant wouldn‚Äôt chance take hold US.

Plus even vaccine doesn‚Äôt provide 100% protection delta variant, still provides certain level protection importantly, decreases rate hospitalizations due Covid. 97% people hospitalized Covid last months unvaccinated. Shocker. Cruise ships account maybe 1% norovirus cases per year... 

From 2008-2014 74mil cruise ship passengers, less 13k involved norovirus outbreak. sure, bc heard outbreak couple times news assume happens daily  work Fortune 50 company waiting see, expect vaccine mandate. They're even enforcing 'mask vaccinated' requirement.

And always call others afraid taking common sense precautions. tried go source quotes waning transmission protection data Israel work phone. Listed description.  Israel. airtight ship

That's doublespeak profession? means need little VaporRub ... cures anything üòÇ  I'm UK maybe things different for-profit healthcare system healthcare systems runs close capacity year round.

I would imagine for-profit system even likely run close capacity there's money loads spare capacity.

As such, even relatively small numbers admitted lead healthcare availability reduced resources diverted COVID patients.

The NHS said unlikely would ever run capacity would need turn people away door, would reallocate resources elsewhere would mean cancer diagnosis treatment would delayed etc. Emergency medicine would last effected.

Flattening curve gives healthcare breathing room overwhelmed healthcare binary situation. go ways though. expect individuals regular exposure 'boosted' immunity regular basis. fucking shitshow agency care anymore. I'm vaccinated rest family. I've heard, vaccinated people got covid said symptoms resembled cold something. know... gotten cold looong time forgot like. Kinda wanna experience lol

BRING ON! That‚Äôs true good remember. It‚Äôs hard watching kid go this, though. Especially you‚Äôve tried hard avoid it. Never trust someone brings trusted.  thought talking things cause children hospitalized covid. Neither really ""free"". matter treated, when. US, taxpayers paid development vaccines; variety payers treatment tried honor system. abysmal (yet, extremely predictable) failure.

And far many politicians fighting proof vaccination. I'm gonna go whim say everyone using it, opting out. Dude what‚Äôs problem? numbers studies highlighted articles. taking get numbers? damn articles! studies based Israel. ever say studies apply yet US? didn‚Äôt. said according studies, efficacy numbers infection severe disease. 

Plus talking patients injected six months. US started vaccinating people mid-December. way past 6 months. saying one US who‚Äôs vaccinated December hospitalized? facts back claim?  Thank posting this! requiring indoors everyone regardless vaccination now. mean nurses vaccinated less risk almost entirely covid patients assholes. remotely true, would surely get bad tantamount anti-vaccine propaganda suggest would case. earth think vaccines given small amount people useful population level?

Even person planet vaccinated would expect much better vaccinated. need wear masks stores, half them. seems like normal comorbidity rate... Took tries find [source actually mentioned (many referencing paywalled source..). based CDC recommendations, [which maximize protection Delta variant prevent possibly spreading others, wear mask indoors public area [of substantial high I'm actually starting see another path. see real possibility resolved two group split. One group takes vaccine every 6 months. group avoids vaccines probably contracts disease every 12-18 months instance disease additional damage accumulated damage kills incapacitates them.

It's kinda like watching zombie movie slow motion.  fuck think federal government do? Please never go back. making plenty money without you. Death rates pretty low increase vaccination..we count infections...only serious treated cases country's history that's happened, usually gets ugly fast.

Eisenhower calling national guard escort black kids schools state governor defied federal integration mandates one example. national guard facing state police. Fortunately escalate. /s hope government worker walks retail store Saturday morning, walks cashier, asks weekend plans. 

And then, pitiable worker, face devoid expression, utter, ""just work,"" inwardly contemplating would recreate scene money ripped one lady's face made. Still better 0 percent effectiveness antivaxxers enjoy. Yeah. vaccine magical forcefield prevents virus front entering body. common sense. Australians access widely available vaccines like Astrazeneca instead fearmongering statistically insignificant risk blood clotting vaccinated people. Question. work retail. hell mean. could always exposed would never know... don‚Äôt know tell you.

Depersonal it. Deal facts.

And I'd say starters stick things impossible. patients injected 6 months. None.

I care whether they're Jerusalem Israel Bethlehem PA.

They exist. know efficacy 6 months injected long.
 

Second, takes 145 person sample come valid percentage project onto real population. 

In ways people tiny population Jerusalem advantage. Less people compete hospital beds services. huge population studying 145 people saying study definitive, absolutely not, dismissed either. 

1 tiny. ""study"" says almost basis. idea project claim efficacy actually trails certain rate certain number months.

2 - months simply happened yet.
We almost patients injected long. 1st injection? March April? July? yet study efficacy 6 months? Guess is?

August September? 

There's data this. ""study"" involving people people could display efficacy 6 months 6 months yet.

So get numbers from? LA county indoor mask mandate Disneyland LA county mask mandate yet. hard patient covid made unemployed year months like got double Pfizer. die, die.  NOPE makes tricky. 

Treating everyone they're playing field works everyone playing field. 

It gets dicey start ascribing insurmountable innate characteristics can't changed affect people act. thing matters whether number zeroers going down. It‚Äôs really hard thing accept, you‚Äôre right. infection control. sucks, we‚Äôre point. Frankly, news viral loads pans right, don‚Äôt see masks coming indoors again. sample size fairly small, read much it.
This report seems state opposite, although purely anecdotal:

""Long COVID-19 unlikely among fully vaccinated, physicians say"" second shot hit hard weekend. low risk demo (no conditions, 35, shape), don‚Äôt want another shot unless Please give us boosters overlords quite sure others say said it, but... name sub ""COVID ZERO BUST"".

That said, we're waiting two kids 12 able get vaccinated. Sticking masks caution then, much can, assessing risky situations case-by-case basis. going family wedding two weeks, instance, gonna go numbers started going again.

And might overcautious person think we're going COVID zero endemic, again, kids vaccinated unnecessary risk are.

We'll deal school comes hopefully get ahead bit district New Jersey great about. Kids full remote (though hybrid available) late March masks always mandated school grounds times. Probably going back that, would imagine, vaccinated. really...they never published data rescinded masking two months ago. agency looks data thinks relevant, makes decisions based that, issues recommendations. They're they've done whole pandemic, better worse. Zero reason? Lol 
You literally sound like news right now.  tens thousands deaths due vaccine 1 reason. immune system trustworthy vaccine(s) even FDA approved apparently essentially uneffective sooner later. really ""instead of"", it? Getting vaccinated community service itself. actively aiding community getting vaccinated. Maybe use different boogieman like Amazon. Hey maybe asshats elected Desantis but...what third thing said...?  obsolete thanks jackasses like won‚Äôt get it, allowing mutate. Maybe US take page ole Mexico City's government playbook create mascot make vaccine seem less scary.

I'm serious, created mascot vaccination events people 18 29 years old. fucking thing dude panda costume name is... Pandemio.

God, love place sometimes. 

And think I'm kidding:


[Here's Pandemio getting Pandemio hyping people here's Pandemio Believe not, people things good community.  I‚Äôm low risk, catch this, hope dead end virus. Stupid question probably... Delta variant chance burning like past variants? even say past variants burnt mutate? guess I‚Äôm asking - light end tunnel outside getting people vaccinated? indication? know people keep mentioning UK‚Äôs numbers. don‚Äôt know state Israeli hospitals, however, burnout also make illnesses much worse. Again, nature study means would include symptoms. There's reason stress it. Get tested, either don't. quarantine  Oh making joke original commenter saying ‚Äúthe vaccine‚Äù. reality think we‚Äôre far full approval, think waiting see efficacy holds making final decision. I‚Äôm assuming Pfizer probably get first given they‚Äôre already one step ahead EUA game (being vaccine 12-17 demographic) found solution COVID. racism‚Ä¶  would care ablut unvaccinated? Hospitals wont overwhelmed majority potential hospitalizations vaccinated people unable vaccinated wear masks want to.

I see point judging someone want vaccinated season.
I get seasonal flu shots think need it, that's really get bothered peers comnunity refuses get covid shots. Especially since know aparrently still spread even vaxxed dont' learn... think time humans go extinct. reason there‚Äôs evidence vaccinated individuals pick delta variant Covid spread others without getting sick themselves. (Previously wasn‚Äôt shown case original ‚Äúalpha‚Äù Covid.) 

That‚Äôs mask recommendations changed time. recommend wearing mask (to avoid spreading potential Covid) testing they‚Äôre shown negative. That's question re: kids. 9 year old 6 year old. goddamn CDC media U.S. make difficult truly assess risk vaccinated children can't get vaccinated. Everything feels like doomsday hyperbole overconfidence, there's middle ground. 

With kids going back school September, risk time matter even delta mutations pose greater threat children 12. 

Are gonna stuff schools, cross fingers, hope best? Cause that's seems right now. seem willingness parse science give us straight. either sky falling everyone fine they're vaccinated ""it's bad kids anyway..."" 

Where hell find measure truth?  Whatever I'm vaccinated. Gonna go get Korean bbq group 20 weekend, peace corona vaccinated ain't concern vaccine safe effective. literally zero reason get it. 

Getting vaccine helps community  It‚Äôs highly unlikely, research shows fact look numbers. hear I'm Europe pay somewhat attention FDA says. 

I assume emergency use expire soon actual process (that take time) talking about? 

EMA EU give temporary approval like UK US, dragged us weeks approvals permanent includes ones children. RemindMe! 1 day  110 vaccinated people died 5 months. people died tangled bedsheets period. lot. Think way: kids dead. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Chances cold.  still things besides covid get sick. Epsilon variant perhaps? whatever Greek Alphabet name now. Going running Greek Alphabet names eventually. course would say shit like that. Increased testing leads increased positives. Increased positives justifies increased government mandates interference. governments ease restrictions mandates, start educational campaigns going forward, needing boosters eventually.

As people can't get vaccinated want another layer protection, there's always voluntary mask wearing sanitizers - something vulnerable vaccinated. means keep injecting vaccine approved yet even though obsolete soon. 

I'm gonna take downvotes think it. There's serious head sand mentality sub moment comes reduced vaccine effectiveness.

Quite funny way group constantly moaning anti-vaxers ignoring science year top. maybe even sticker top post sub. also going require guests wear masks indoors starting July 30th. official process go takes set amount time. case common sense, that's why. Masks okay, better alternatives. According nasal sprays really effective blocking infections. course vaccines proven work really well. look UK, huge surge covid cases recently, really tiny increase deaths. shows well vaccines work practice. scottish person, hate anti vaxers/maskers use movie justify ""freedoms"". comment automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Especially petty crimes like minor theft marijuana charges already know unvaxxed do.... Policies place last year made sense wake fact way protect general populace. do. Kind of.

I see forcing measures help lessen distrust towards governments. 

People told vaccinated, lives get back normal. think countries states low vax rates, wait see numbers inevitable booster shots... lot people got first doses lives would inconvenienced longer realise naught, refuse part silliness going forward. Can‚Äôt even get first shot yet. I‚Äôm you. What‚Äôs point?

There much bullshit tolerate. 

Shout people Missouri proud, masked vaxxed ""miracle "" already happened.  vaccines extremely effective. got 6 months ago, 2nd shot 3 weeks first. talking loosing 10-15% 6 months? good new virus like that.

New studies also showing waiting dose increase long terme protection. 

Once every country get vaccine, think could see end this. Country already vaccinated probably need another shot, expected like flu shot. means good ethical person. 

World could use types like you. *scene: empty dark road, somewhere outside Kansas city*

*two vehicles approach one another, lookout authorities*

*first driver:* got stuff ?

I understand intellectually honest vaccine hesitancy point, can't understand someone could vaccine seemingly ideological reasons.

How one Covid vaccines without whole raft concomitant ""woo"" world-view?

It make sense. East Baton Rouge, people appearing Judge Fred Crifasi, 19th Judicial District Court, afforded opportunity get vaccinated lieu certain community service hours. rapid spread delta variant, many cities states implementing renewed mask mandates steps curb infection rates. ‚ÄúA judge lot sentencing discretion comes community service,‚Äù said Franz Borghardt, Baton Rouge defense attorney.

[Vaccine FAQ Part FAQ Part appointment bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* What‚Äôs alternative? Seriously? Chasing tales rolling lockdowns, endless mask mandates, contact tracing, quarantines forever? Even 110% population vaccinated masked, would still spread. ‚ÄúYeah would spread less.‚Äù Doesn‚Äôt matter. would still spread. could still mutate. It‚Äôs never going away. don‚Äôt see isn‚Äôt clear people. Sure, focusing deaths alone might perfect metric, neither cases.

Majority cases end totally benign never even get near system - let alone overwhelm it. 

A better metric would hospitalizations guess.

My point is, never able convince general populace fear something believe wont harm them. Let mandatory vaccinations, mandates, lockdowns whatever - make reject policies politicians implemented even more. due respect, that. Ill mask - problem there, going self-isolate asymptomatically protect vaccine hesitant. stay home time?

It's much return mask mandates vaccinated issue with, almost certainly followed return restrictions. vaccinated supposed get tested exposure even asymptomatic. Next, 6 foot social distancing brought back. capacity restrictions restaurants, bars, retailers. closing gyms businesses. schools go back virtual. Etc. anyone wants vaccine get one today 30% adults stubborn. That's issue focusing on, trying shut everything again. guidance known exposure. anytime interact stranger could potentially covid. 

You actually read article spread misinformation complain it. long covid says hi go Walgreens something Masking ain‚Äôt going help people around aren‚Äôt masking unless you‚Äôre rocking N95 would wait til proven safe (fda approved)

As FYI, vaccine already proven safe. That's got authorization use.  Great job AstraZeneca. seems like production finally serious level. 

Some weeks ago someone posted comparison production output different medical companies, one link? can‚Äôt seem find anywhere. Absolutely get tested, worry much whether covid something else. age vaccination status outcomes covid different respitory illnesses anyway. Whatever is, get tested, isolate, rest, hydrate - whatever is, likely start feeling better pretty soon. It‚Äôs interesting say that, vaccinated person, recently, feeling really ignored CDC. felt like hyperfocused getting shots arms good job managing expectations, behaviors, mental well-being vaccinated people. get vaccinated. need tell mom want to. 


All vaccine help immune system fight covid. long term effects. know can? Covid. Covid thousand times dangerous vaccine. 

Getting vaxxed help mom whole community. mean ""Tragedy sublime""? How'd lockdown eu go? tell, they're spiking like rest us. Much appreciated! I‚Äôm hoping it‚Äôs allergies acting wack again, I‚Äôm doubting it. Two people hung trip told they‚Äôve feeling weather too. One unvaccinated said felt way Tuesday also fully vaxxed felt like crap yesterday chills fever.

Hopefully, bounce back quickly don‚Äôt get anyone else infected process! Hey friend.

I caught fully vaxed. Two co workers got it. unvaxed.

For fully vaxed person, worrisome. need get tested confirm infect others. 

My coworkers hellish time. symptoms cleared quickly. Although, taste smell lagged.

Take comfort made right moves acted ethically towards humans getting vaxed. likely hood serious complications low negilable. Y‚Äôall need start focusing UNvaccinated, quit worrying that‚Äôll right thing Pfizer filed first, expected get approval next weeks. Moderna J&amp;J weeks behind that. theory, may seem hit magic number immune percentage, virus suddenly disappear. simple logistical model would tell you.

In practice, that's unlikely happen respiratory virus several reasons:

* Immunity wane time, even still enough prevent severe outcomes
* virus mutate
* large seasonal variations R0
* virus jump hosts (dogs, cats, bats) back

For reasons, Covid much likely become seasonal virus peak disappear. living it, it'll spread every year. might cause hospitalization peaks time similar common three-letter named virus already have*, possibly less, depending vaccine uptake future generations.

Asterisk*: Apparently type word automod deletes post &lt;_&lt; You‚Äôre missing point. Unvaccinated people risk. Don‚Äôt bring around piece shit grandmother leave alone. I'm vaxxed mask whenever go out, family isn't. That's problem. stupid. I'm also young high risk despite POTS HSD that. I'd still much rather avoid it, especially need surgery something. breakthroughs freaking out.

As dentist, getting knocked works wonders lol Thank several people come get vaccinated tried sort disguise appearance‚Äù

I know serious subject, can‚Äôt help picturing someone ill-fitting wig, wearing plastic Groucho Marx disguise mask. ‚ÄúRight way, Mr. Vandelay.‚Äù  university, Florida, sent email yesterday ""it's back normal"". masks. vaccines. graduate director mandatory person meetings 50 plus people. 

I 18 month old son. I'm terrified go back bring something him. anyone spews ""kids easier go"" really want hear it. son hospital last year week salmonella infection ended lasting 9 months. outlier, uncommon. need return work, I'm terrified hell another outlier Covid. Looks like vaccine sentence ü•∏ vaccination rate lower Kazakhstan, it‚Äôs great easy way cities (I'm KC). frankly shocked found family small town MO vaccinated. done good job convincing dumb people be. vaccinated agree anti vaccinated points. I‚Äôm also somewhat religious last line perfect.

Edit: except fact vaccines don‚Äôt work know do. Im really going CDC blowing Classic ""blame immigrants"" playbook. personally can't think way. 2 children 12, already caught virus once. understand Haha yeah I‚Äôm coming NY. dad passed 2 years ago, get anxious mom. view - vaccinated, life short, there‚Äôs lot she‚Äôs missing staying home so... 

But yeah may worth cool headed conversation

I also write working gym...but NY vaxx rates significantly higher odds colleges requiring masks mandating vaccines? I'm sure another semester socail distancing masks, especially everyone's risk infection relativly low everyone's risk serious illness remakably low.

Here's pretty picture visualising data you: [page still bunch shelves‚Ä¶ took priority 65+ really long slowly. younger age groups looking make shots available population October.. mix bureaucracy shortages every time open new age group :( Community approach best way. every community overrun virus makes sense Governor state make blanket mandate. controlled locally county city commission right best communities. Nobody defiance non-mandate. title click bait. Agree 100%. Usually stay inside summer. hot. Also people moving here. husband says traffic bad summer compared previous summers. one said vaccines useless. Vaccines could effectively ended didn‚Äôt holdouts. reason Delta able get established population selfish unvaccinated. upset ongoing restrictions, don‚Äôt blame government. Don‚Äôt even blame virus. Blame unvaccinated. It‚Äôs selfishness. Maybe? Probably depends date goes! Good luck! ‚ÄúPeople wearing white sheets burning crosses immune Covid.‚Äù

‚ÄîGreg, probably üá®üá¶ Give booster RFN! There‚Äôs tendency subreddit people broadly latch negative news negative studies ignoring anything optimistic, it‚Äôs making people way afraid (unless immunocompromised) fact companies requiring vaccines masks gives little hope yesterday's interesting day, people think good messaging going happen. 

1. seems everyone, including people vaccinated, going get Covid multiple times lives. Washington Nationals 1/3 team test positive despite vaccinated. People seem understand vaccination stop infection, significantly decreases likelihood symptom nearly eliminated severe disease death. 

2. Delta wave good thinkin long run since seems driving vaccination pushing mandatory vaccinations?

3. I'm totally baffled CDC's mask guidance. based hospitalizations cases?

4. someone government say/come consistent messaging? Everyone going get Covid. vaccinated, almost certainly going fine. not, YMMV. FYI, think mask going protect you, actual good one fitted properly. around higher risk people, might want wear mask protect them. Yep, shot record already mile long. Shoot up, doc. No. group people already low risk dying without vaccinated. Agreed. small town collectively decide make someone‚Äôs life very, difficult unpleasant.  Lol, copy paste every thread. weird. Totally agree!  Yeah really doesn‚Äôt matter people agreeing. end day, follow mandates obey. Hell, went yesterday afternoon surprised see lot masks. city state mandate place. people choosing wear one own, due new CDC Guidelines. I‚Äôd say least 45% wearing one. Absolutely nothing 100% safe. would talk mom see feels. know couple people sheltered year lost loved ones due various reasons regretted seeing them.

It‚Äôs really personal risk decision. going trip 65 year old parents SC couple weeks.

Edit - also didn‚Äôt say coming - say FL you‚Äôll probably safer lol I'm Florida whole family sick colds. negative covid, flu, rsv tests. Usually get flu really bad cold August unusual us honest. Summer cold worst agree thia spend time indoors (although anywhere 2 year old). many places around world people would jump vaccine offered still waiting, due supply shortages contracts. day felt like crap second shot sore arm. crap feeling started 10 hours shot. varies person, it‚Äôs way better getting Covid. Hit one places giving free stuff! twitter comment saw last year said something along lines ""We never lockdown. Middle class people stayed home poor people brought things"".

Still depressingly true. It‚Äôs still completely wrong, percentage adults, entire population.
Bergamo province 1.11M people: = 65% wear mask get vaxed ok! poor dad spent lot time hospital past year worried (for multiple reasons) hasn‚Äôt contracted Covid. went PCP allergist shutdown scary, happy it. Take care yourself! 

‚Ä¶but figure nervous dentist, I‚Äôm ears haha. that‚Äôs good idea! pretty shameful, tbh.

The absolute morons ""protesting"" Western nations epitome ""first world problems"".  I‚Äôve followed experts pandemic &amp; one Osterholm. summer 2020, couple shows ‚Äúgoing back school‚Äù epidemiologist, explicit ‚Äúcases per 100k‚Äù numbers mind get back normal. cited numbers would make sense open schools. He‚Äôs huge proponent keeping schools open, numbers low enough contact tracing help keep outbreaks bay. understands risk &amp; need continue living life risk levels appropriate. 

So, low level community spread able live &amp; # clearly known people like Osterholm &amp; experts there. We‚Äôre headed direction numbers yet :-/ well gee wonder why. unvaccinated moved couch since March 2020 watching vaccinated people return couch. INSERT *FIRST TIME?* MEME Kids less danger adults virus (and parents continue take precaution), immunocompromised people obviously going continue take high level caution years come. really anyway around that, it‚Äôs unreasonable reshape society them. Obviously mask isn‚Äôt big deal, we‚Äôre going back cycle, it‚Äôs going stop mask wearing. logic target trucks trump flags number stickers anybody hard data percentage positive COVID cases vaccinated people? can't seem find good figure this, odd really easy get information. 

It seemed like months leading vaccine, narrative ""the vaccine solve this"" vaccine comes out, became ""this beginning end"" sure looked like while.

Go back month, remember seeing article said something affect ""92% COVID cases un-vaccinated people"" 

But rising case numbers narrative seems shifted ""the vaccine works"" ""well, still get COVID vaccine!""

It seems like lot people trying minimize effects vaccine, like always knew never going 100% effective. feeling air effective might well be? feels like vaccine much anything, makes cases less fatal, that's it. Thanks clarifying answering question! Seems worse AZ wild.

AZ worse antibody response, much better cell response. Seems like cells lot heavy lifting delta. Government going pass laws give covid time off. Right, happens won‚Äôt old normal. happens, maybe will. wouldn‚Äôt living virus, then. We‚Äôd living herd immunity. Stay safe! Crazy times. fuck grown adults need mascot? took long enough. never understood CDC straight said vaxxed people get tested even exposed. Testing continued encouraged across board people, vaxxed people specifically testing would (will able to) give us important insight transmissibility infection rates post-vax. kids Nepal smart. would assume that? get since CDC confirmed vaccination affect viral load. surprised many people already accepted social end here.

Many recent ""new mask mandates"" place actually apply county buildings kind thing. case they'll probably laxly enforced.

I'm sorry, US can't stomach restrictions, regardless whether think they're needed not. government attempt go far would lead massive unrest.  review 16 different observational studies - taken massive grain salt. words - high likelihood factors ""mental health disorders"" influential claimed results. One friends ran lab sequencing genomes. would frequently ask questions things, like coronavirus, problem telling "" can't answer interpret answer wrong."" Eventually enough natural immunity. Viruses go around around every unvaccinated person dead. human race survived long did. electrical work healthcare, vaccinated. worst thing exposure, didnt want lie boss. construction site working needed wait two weeks negative test. called people active hospital, tell situation construction site, said forget construction site, come help general maintenance side. 

In experience, construction taking better measures healthcare, itd impossible ask healthcare workers expecting hospital fully staffed. know masked well. Likely N95 better. Yep always &lt;guy vote fault. Right, there's direct correlation many get sick vs many vaccinated. certain masked. Quite possibly N95 better. Non-masked much worse would presume. Toxic positivity new meaning 2020. Agreed although Marijuana treated like alcohol like Canada face charges simple possession discussion another day AZ might effective new variants, hey, vaccine vaccine.

I'm still confused whether unpublished viral load study CDC cited reversal two days ago applied AZ. wasn‚Äôt bargained over. think union sues would lose know long things drag. better metric would hospitalizations guess.

This, quality life cost financial cost (to us) talked enough face counting deaths much still unclear. we‚Äôd overload health care system. Pubic transport hahaha enough non vaccinated people crash health care system.  vaccinated population directly correlates many people get sick fast new variants spread. getting vaccine still responsible move. Definitely agree. feel like lot government agencies leaving things methodology comes public view think would 86% less likely (or 14% chance). 600% likely = 7x higher chance getting it. (100% likely implies 2x higher chance, 200% likely = 3x higher chance, etc.) dose original Pfizer shot. traveling Superspreader policy party doesn‚Äôt like masks vaccines on-brand. limitless resources federal government could harnessed provide people skilled PR contract competent PR firm. Come Florida try spend days outdoors heat, humidity, daily thunderstorms. 

I've made comparison before, see people staying inside summer people north stay inside winter. Keep mind indoors mean staying home, sitting inside restaurants instead outside, going inside visiting friends family instead sitting outside, etc. lovely day heat stroke last July trying visit friends outside.

And area, gauge traffic see people about. morning commute long 2019. Stores crowded. Parking popular locations hard find again, unlike 2020. eyes see people 2020.  mask mandate never changed. situation quite fluid, suspect bureaucracy scrambling bit. 

There strong political component. CDC purely acting science, far Well, it‚Äôs virus‚Äôs fault. adapt accordingly. I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôd rather dead put mask go indoors. also drive husband. also sites accessible walking public transit. Also local health departments come house. need require employee, employer government, pay tests. Two tests week $50 pop $5200 year vaccinated. I‚Äôm fully vaccinated currently isolating home sense smell fun stuff comes along flu . I‚Äôm one ‚Äúrare‚Äù breakthrough cases . beyond frustrating breakthrough vaccinated person spew viral load infected unvaccinated person. less likely.

All things equal, viral load point time progression case vaccinated person expected much lower would person vaccinated. CDC would difficulties convince people get vaccinated created reward system u get vaccinated boom freedom mask yours. reality knew still risk put reward get people vaccinated. That‚Äôs opinion. Even the. chance getting getting sick much much smaller. everyone fully vaccinated spread would stop. saying CNN one it, using particular example since that's one mentioned. issue every media outlet. grudgingly wearing mask indoors public places. tell transmission high though I'm vaccinated medical complications put higher risk get it. That, knowledge I'm helping others can't get vaccinated (under 12s uber rare medical cases), thing getting through. I'm point care voluntarily unvaccinated.

Though even limits I'm wearing mask gym unless required, recommended, to. Especially aligning results peer-reviewed work. Whenever happens, especially data published literature, heightened awareness flaw. Ok we‚Äôre back that, cool. good news nice lasted. think experts forget people developed type mental health disorder worsening long term psychological damage. don‚Äôt care CASES! Lol no, one prioritizes people level. I'm vaccinated careful, worded way cuz idea self-preservation somehow feels unacceptable They've lost touch premier reasoning behind state's rights:

The closer get governing body single individual, better representation governing body.

A federal government touch wants needs different states.

So yes, state better equipped govern people.

But keeps going that...

Counties, cities, municipalities, ultimately sole individual take precedence states many, many cases.

It's really awkward state banning right locales vaccine &amp; mask mandates. Emergency care hospitalization essential services. no, can't that. observation higher nasal titer vaccinated vs unvaccinated?

 


Reminder lab leak hypothesis fringe conspiracy...  Hey now. need cut deep. Aight? one asked yuo get real here. point die? would literally things unvaccinated see Monica Gandhi too. point entire time. nonsense straightforward what's really going on. CDC always full excuses cavalier approach pandemic I'm fine this. fund charging fines people get vaccine. get vaccine actually $200 ($100 cash avoiding $100 fine). get $200.

We really things need tackle country. big scheme things pandemic hold candle challenges beginning face global warming. people can't deal masks... 1 10 chance getting infected exposure? somebody explain? thought vaccine effectiveness rates reported relative risk reductions. perhaps 1 10 relative unvaccinated population exposed infected, surely 1 10 overall?

Just antivax crowd wants self-immolate mean rest us forced go them. insane. work something even patient facing getting tested 3 times week. test disparity unreal. Narrator: Sadly, care. Yeah, clear I'm singling comment would agree need data coming definitive conclusion. 

Just making general point I've read past weeks, people refusing accept believe reports based scientific evidence time complaining anti-vaxers thing needs enemies...

People seen bunch movies vaccine invented last 5 minutes there's happy ending shortly thereafter. year, people told ""soon vaccine, everything get back normal.""

Vaccines useful tool, seem definitely reduce severity symptoms catch covid. apparently going bring pandemic kind screeching halt. Vaccination rates slow (we're something like 12% worldwide). starting evidence even vaccinated people transmit covid time immune system fighting virus.

IMO:

* going long grind quick victory.

* need working add lot tools toolbox besides vaccines. tested scanning QR code phone QR code string characters presumably needs specific NHS app actually decode it. Yeah, wondered percentage too. lot data Israel pretty shaky. sure is, think important continue see else comes since often seem outliers. Science determining facts like many people infected, rapidly variants spreading effective different measures containing outbreaks. Policy taking facts making decisions real time affects real people. Communication making sure general public understands science decisions.

I don‚Äôt think scientists failing, it‚Äôs policy makers communicators failing. never recommended masks. understand switching policies frequently affects trust public institution. Trust that‚Äôs already eroded misinformation bungling last year. Yep SG1  not. would protest eradicate vaccines, mandatory vaccination. get grip AstraZeneca‚Äôs revenue Covid-19 vaccine reached almost $1.2 billion first half year, company announced Thursday.

Didn't AstraZeneca say Corona virus vaccine non-profit? Yea, explaining son even showed pictures kids polio hooked iron lung machines. onboard vaccination train thankfully. mom (my ex) believing ridiculous stuff recent ""huge amount deaths caused vaccination"" supposed ""leak"" really another lie spread. business shut government. wouldn‚Äôt take money government designed support businesses shut Well, could man made well accomplish this.

Yes, someone knew get together 4 fully vaccinated friends. ended covid shortly Let's hope that's Celsius Fahrenheit. fact protestors shame. rest world suffering vaccine apartheid meanwhile privileged Americans refusing get vaccine reserved priority IKR? Read Edit :) CDC flying blind lately. I'm talking hospitalizations, total infections. breakthrough cases among vaccinated people, cases usually mild. 

And data seem fishy--about 40% UK hospitalizations people least 1 dose, 15% double vaccinated. makes sense higher rate hospitalization among vaccinated people expected country almost everyone vaccinated (simply virtue almost group infect), opposed country like US much, much less people gotten jabbed. something reall bey worried about, J&amp;J research booster necessary plenty available one need be. Talks privilege. here. Absolutely crazy people become risk adverse, wonder people even drive cars? Like miniscule chance dying hospitalized COVID people going nuts. 

Either way, people CDC live bubble, think everyone cautious enough dedicate years adapting behavior eradicate virus vaccinated bad all. society mostly done fighting this. 

The places enacting mask mandates places high vaxx rates. peak pandemic went northern PA maybe 25% wearing masks, county one lowest vaccination rates. 

I'm wearing mask unless business requires it. Luckily, PA going enact another mandate. I'm moving upstate NY Cuomo considering it. wish moving NH. Live free die. tug war happening since last year. going real bad hurt bottom lines another summer. It‚Äôs surreal think healthcare professional unvaccinated. really makes wonder. driving car dangerous potentially deadly others. 50,000 year die car accidents. dont see level hysteria 1/500ths deaths. reaction wildly disproportionate compared things likely kill you. people wearing masks homes, running outside themselves, cars driving alone - INSANITY. another reason embarrassed American...the spread misinformation needs stopped. Based spiking cases, basically are. Thanks anti-vaxxers! Collective? Apparently older variants- delta, believe considerably less 15 minutes would put someone exposed. think still conducting research see cutoff be. think people almost dangerous Anti-vaxxers. They‚Äôre still promoting false narrative vaccines hypocritically wanting benefits. Conspiracies like dumb. conspiracies, like one, completely unravel ask one question: benefits conspiracy?

The answer nobody. Nobody benefits increased gov't mandates &amp; interference.

And count politicians always one thing: whatever interest. isn't. say thing regards living room. Good riddance. horrible inappropriate. true. rhinovirus outbreak New Zealand, pretty bad RSV outbreak tho. Also schools locked 3 months max last year. They've operating normal since barring localised outbreaks. I'm assuming sarcastic. There's much education encouragement vaccines absurd. There's amount able change anti-vaxxers attitudes. many stories fighting concept seeing part elaborate hoax right deaths. get that, frustrating need reward system ask adults right thing protect community around them. This, many countries around world struggle get vaccines. i'm really curious many mild symptomatic breakthrough cases go unreported brushed summer cold stomach flu. No, Pfizer, Moderna, J&amp;J vaccines shown neutralizing antibody effects Delta strain, well real-world effectiveness. I've 'lets think this' camp since week developed three step plan.

Step 1: get covid. 
Step 2: Get vaccine 
Step 3: get covid. Yes, right....because *that* part mentioned...(kids, fragile) ‚ÄúThey.‚Äù Cases well deaths seem low far mean I'm good scary headline anyone wonder media constantly blowing things proportion might one reason many Americans believe corona news get vaccine?

Would make difference vaccine uptake news little tempered people started trusting it? mAskS r sAntAniC riTuAL Agreed. best 'mandate' see would masks essential public places (grocery stores, public transit, medical facilities). protecting immunocompromised otherwise vulnerable individuals places access. much, know. think becomes issue feel like ""losing"" something - time, people, experiences, possibilities... always thought introvert isolation really much, I'm sure anymore I'm really questioning whether really introvert begin with. 

I particularly like staying people, like alone either. I'm alone alone, live best friend girls coming quite often, plus couple friends left ""pandemic purge"" (not died, cut contact lots people thought friends actually just... there).
And still, feel ""ok"", feel isolated starting get me... know what's up. even everyone vaccinated best vaccines, virus spread, mutate kill less people, vulnerable tend vaccinated already, future mutations would likely even less lethal.

What point future measures then?  vaccination numbers wrong. 27% TOTAL population fully vaccinated. 38% TOTAL population received least 1 dose.

Source Prime MInister's Office Japan: (in japanese) outbreak already (US).

my local hospitals starting get overwhelmed again, vast majority covid cases unvaccinated, number breakthrough cases needing medical treatment nothing sneeze at. point, would say main worry ADE effects would coronavirus mutates point antibodies generated current vaccines become 


Isn't exactly happened here? Yeah, ""Covid plot Democrats kill Republican voters, purposefully used Facebook, YouTube Twitter target Republicans make refuse vaccine, end hospital worse"" Hey I've heard before!

It's like reading news March 2020 point looking cases anymore, instead look deaths, shouldn‚Äôt we? 

If vaccines don‚Äôt eliminate cases, cases always happen. perhaps do, focus vaccinating old vulnerable exclusively, focus treating harsher cases start treating covid much like treat flu. 

We politicised pandemic point people make pro anti vaxx camps wtf. 

I don‚Äôt see point dividing population making lives insufferable virus even vaccinations eliminate completely. Let people decide live lives, vaxx don‚Äôt, wear mask don‚Äôt, it‚Äôs call. Yeah, can't always notice got covid, still alot people vaccinated get sick. Including ones want vaccine, matter time whether governments decide antivaccers made choice open everything vaccine stop transmission (which seems CDC saying) mean variants also come vaccinated people? who? ""the vaccine""?? Im sitting hostel Spain, getting antigen test 1.5 hours, wondering Im going test positive fucked flight home Saturday, subsequently miss first day new job Monday. 

No bueno. I've saying people need keep wearing masks months getting voted hell it. People lazy want easy way out, thinking vaccine solve everything, fact giving people false sense security allowing virus mutate even more.

We'll dealing shit decade two rate... coma something since March 2020? 4 million people died COVID since started. It‚Äôs flu! necessarily. got Moderna doses 3-4 weeks apart. Per cdc site currently 34,000,000 infected 69% vaccinated least once. 

No information many infected vaccinated twice information many unvaccinated. Why? 

The problem unvaccinated, problem vaccines effective claimed officials. they're claiming third vaccine possibility additional vaccines required. Tf! Literally said today. Frankly speaking number much higher expected. Alberta embarrassment rest Canada. people believe infecting another person hazardous disease issue moral ethical concern--even likely personally bear consequences. Europe lot country predominately Moderna vacced. believe would call lie *don't* expect number cases fall steadily base line. taught time ago population growth approximately follows logistic curve (not exponential curve) - whether mice, humans, foxes, bacteria viruses.

If progression delta following logistic curve, new case numbers pretty much *exactly* would expect increasing decreasing side. derivative logistic curve symmetrical, decreasing side decreases rate increasing side did.

This logistic curve derivative looks like:

The red line would population size time (e.g. number people infected delta), blue line derivative (e.g. daily number reported cases). 

The real world data coming UK suggests form population growth happening, really unusual. Thought hollywood portrayal CDC made (like Walking Dead) hot damn incompetent thought. First allowing people drop masks, back tracking shit say. terrible. wear mask, easy get used it. people love stressing this, conveniently forgetting kids people fragile immune systems. people burnt it‚Äôs easier go, ‚Äúeh gives fuck aren‚Äôt vaxxed deserve it‚Äù Vaccine useless 8 months masks not, keep wearing mask.

Go reread article linked. appears though 'facts' bit dated. another strain called columbian strain rising US. Quite ur BS. big jumps far daily cases go‚Ä¶ think getting everyone vaccine magically make things go back normal. I've got sad fucking news you. Testimony people like important counter antivaxx BS claims 'people start dropping dead year shot'. Well, seems people like fine :). That's narrow-minded way looking it. Nothing absolute dealing disease infection. 

The delta variant spreading ferociously idiot 1/3 America banded together give fertile breeding grounds. English article. note Tokyo testing less 9,000 people day. nearly 40% positivity rate.

Official English site Tokyo's reporting testing (not updated since yesterday posting).  Yes, good person always easy often directly rewarded. vast majority friends family vaccinated single one us serious side effects vaccine. say serious, cause get minor side effects like sore arm feeling crappy day. Netherlands significant Moderna usage. even possible get back 0 cases point?

These known cases it‚Äôs likely real number notably higher. Anyone critical thinking skills see never end. new strain new strain one vaccinated enough get it. Stop BS let people live lives! So‚Ä¶ dying isn‚Äôt strong enough argument? think huge part population complete denial covid around long, long time. Unless he's 60 years old lower 1%.

What he's really asking shot make neurotic media-fuelled paranoia go away, that's going happen matter many boosters gets. Pierce county Washington damn well, case count single digits. almost 90. Uuuuuuugggghhhhh. Yea. dare change recommendations based emerging information? aren‚Äôt people following data UK?

The vaccines highly effective lay variant, massively reduced deaths hospitalisations.

The vaccines work don‚Äôt really need worry you‚Äôre double jabbed. local supermarket Marmite tills, well shelves. One place ate fish chips, put paper table cover print plate knife fork. thought cute, poured bowl hot crisps fish batter directly onto paper! chin nearly hit table.  can‚Äôt find updated data delta accounted 90%+ (recent) infections here. Although media haven‚Äôt blown delta fear quite much see Reddit. It‚Äôs accounted infections months now, since winter lockdown. necessarily. Stuck enclosed space days weeks infected may subject much viral load overwhelms protection vaccine. sure Xinjiang camps better Covid control mesures

I wonder many children corpses underneath American children containment camps Conspiracy theory?  Woo-woo... That‚Äôs fine go see people complaining newer enthusiasts (or older enthusiasts) ruining hobby. you‚Äôre California, government. They‚Äôre closing testing centres live. nice way show lot info sure! 

And I'm also suspicious 99% US, think factors could cause make sense, despite vaccine 99% effective reducing hospitalization 

The important might vaccine politicized US, probably means people likely hang people match vaccination status. 
So, even area 50% vaccinated, vaccinated person might live life surrounded 95% vaccinated people, unvaccinated person surrounded 5% vaccinated people [bogus numbers course] 

In case, COVID might actually able sustainably spread amongst vaccinated people begin with. hospitalization rates would low simply getting -- whereas spread unvaccinated group would dramatic.

Second- think less importantly, UK might better vaccine uptake amongst vulnerable group. article stated, vaccinated elderly person still one vulnerable groupings. 
But US, good vaccine uptake among elderly, they're much likely hospitalized. 

I think noticed something lot people missing, infected person 70% protection less death hospitalization they're vaccinated.  
People failing recognize that, far, main benefit vaccine reduction spread amongst vaccinated people. 

[I looked US numbers much, UK, broke cases age, saw cases soaring younger age groups, either increasing all, increasing slowly older age groups] it, then? Every time new variant inevitably pops up, we‚Äôll go ahead waste years lives restrictions DESPITE ENTIRE POINT VACCINE???? Awesome. Great.

I‚Äôm clear - EUA application would end sept 5-11. long review period application? back lockdowns slowly go. Florida posting tens thousands cases per day. We‚Äôve going backwards awhile. Sounds like exposed close someone manner describefd, without mask. Yup even among people took seriously - doubt many us go back masks etc. 60% definitely enough. Especially someone fought jurors knew jury nullification. since children getting vaccines hard get shame parents it, although start notice trend masks. think, want compliance vaccines, best thing would 200$ 300$ monthly stimulus vaccinated. vaccinated time stimulus rolls month, bad, missed 200$. year. bet rates go 80 90% vaccinated. People, especially PEOPLE, generally stick ideals actually poses obstacles. issue fines need people enforce general public approve. bad, actually! ""chosen"" profit. Oxford University invented vaccine, since publicly funded, said company agreed non-profit deal would get vaccine. choice here, altruistic motive. federal government workplaces. feel same, news feels doom-y spring 2020 even vaccines. know personally 4 people breakthrough COVID infections. fully vaccinated. I'm back masking public feel businesses going back masks, going slow return normalcy. think we'll it, worry there's going light lockdown future. Again. media narrative sprinting towards feels like. It‚Äôs bothersome people think ‚Äúcompelling people right thing‚Äù somehow anti liberty freedom, sort new radical thing we‚Äôve discovered. compel kinds people kinds things far worse reasons. way past time sensible legal coercion. lack surveillance testing easy access on-demand rapid testing makes much irrelevant point 

Over year half consistent rapid turnaround time mass testing. get son tested 2 weeks ago, live California Bay area, time needing find test center result, 5 half days. Places around us walk-up testing can't confirm proximity someone else also tested positive, closest location booked appointments day ahead.

I remember thinking last summer, ""can't wait rapid/surveillance testing."" thing winter 2020 (we scare proximity someone confirmed positive needed get tested knew get tested getting result back 6 days; thankfully negative, probably practicing correct precautions).

You tell people get tested want, issue inconvenient access getting tested slow turnaround time, basically revert us back start pandemic; confirming people already know 99% certainty covid-19 actually it. We're seeing county (with high vaccination rate, 88% 12+ ages), positivity test rate like 3%. land owned leased city. almost effect. Reporting abysmal. agree CDC lost credibility No, *passless*, like guy hugs basketball follow protocol, parents outside school, force everyone else responsible two largest factors almost guarantee exposure even perfect. point really anti vaxxers.

Right - here's thing. know vaxxed people everything right (or trying to) held higher standard schools. Ok, I'm wearing mask Target protect kid, go school requirement teachers vaxxed, etc., good do? 

Why asking strangers around kids let kids go environments, like school camp, etc., going matter?  Na, I‚Äôm good really witnessing birth new common flu strain. guess people always act like children.

The choice either poorly behaved well behaved children. may well discipline them, alternative chaotic. belligerent children cant wear masks. ""getting emotional it"" .. improve situation. 

It's like stuck traffic-jam. sit ranting complaining frustrated ""not fair"" ""taking long"".. things magical fix. 

There's lot situations life may choice ""try positive make best bad situation"". said he's immunocompromised tho, may mean vaccine protect well people got sick. protest mandatory vaccination (or take away rights) protest vaccines health care it‚Äôs 15 min exposure case without adequate PPE understand mean, I'll get tested know quarantine family/friends coworkers. Almost vaccinated. 

&amp;#x200B;

Plus lets WFH decide make us go office again. lol weird me. live Norway, 50% new cases age group &lt;30. Still 0 hospitalised due covid age group. 
And whole pandemic, far see, 0 people age 20 hospitalised due covid. would guess either skipped 2nd dose really bad reaction it. boosters end yearly thing years like flu vaccine drop even single booster we're still firmly pandemic draw big numbers. got four lines card reason, shoot up. I'm gonna super powers time ends. thought same, found [this argument Chris really convincing. TL;DW: People *exact thing* seatbelt laws way back when, saying things want government telling do. laws came anyway, people ... buckled forgot whole thing. think there's still positive risk balance young vulnerable - low though risk might be, still higher getting vaccine. Indeed, several days bed aches pains awful temperature something I'd want avoid possible, even life threatening. something I'd personally willing suspend normal activities eighteen months for, I'll give that, certainly something I'd choose prick arm over.

I think that's messaging that's needed - Covid's could called life-threatening 40, trying convince young people switch off. However, still quite unpleasant, vaccine way avoid amount unpleasant experience. It‚Äôs death rates.

I‚Äôve hospitalized (ironically, flu), surprise hospitalization ruin year. stay follow-up demanding, bills take forever pay off. top that, long covid seriously fucking lives. Sounds like calculatingly spreading fear committed right start profit vaccine pandemic

It ""their"" vaccine. Oxford University's vaccine. Oxford University said company agreed non-profit approach could vaccine. That's altruistic move Astrazeneca, simply agreed order gain massive PR opportunity (which blew). exactly luxury home schooling kids, tell that. job invasive ever, acting like stuff kids closet late night zoom meetings. 

I draw line make clear boundaries, many not. pressure sociopaths disrupt home life children disruption they've already reaching critical levels line work. 

I get saying coming from... I'm saying, please try see sides this. sucks lot time great times. magical vacation we're working home. 

Also, terms making spread virus lead burden essential workers, working home one easiest 'wins'. necessary millions people cram onto trains buses ubers fail (and often NYC used work office), simply done. Kids can't vaccinated returning school September going true test bad things get alone keep offices mostly closed. 

The ""return office"" fueled much corporate arrogance resistance anything makes people's lives easier/more balanced forcing basically solidifies two ""opinions"" cold, hard, facts. Many office workers, faced getting unvaccinated kids sick among small perfect winds ventilator, even ammo refuse office scenarios long time, good. That's 100% true. mean ""shut down""? Restaurants still open. Bars still open. Everywhere considered ""essential"" people still went work. Within USA least. nations handled much better. Hell governor even ""restaurant day"" middle pandemic encouraged everyone go restaurants. link journal article showed vaccinated people can‚Äôt spread covid? enough mRNA vaccines here. need AZ? fairness original commenter, discussing hospitalization numbers rather overall infections. 

I issue believing vaccine efficacy might modestly decrease time, seems incredibly unlikely they'll rendered completely useless. Don‚Äôt care. Love Costco Dog.  CDC experts talking sides ass imo. ""Breakthrough infections RARE!"" turns ""Dumb plebes, worried breakthrough cases, always knew would happen!"" Christmas 2019, Mom carrier flu, ended causing whole dinner table get sick. I'm healthy guy, got spiked fever self-quarantine myself. 89 year old grandmother lucky. heart attack sleep complications, almost lost her.

It changed mindset entirely COVID starting tracked. made sure purchase P100 respirator. mission objective COVID simple. Stay protected, prevent becoming ticking time bomb finishes family member.

I swapped respirator cloth mask family vaccinated, I'm still mindset. someone took mindset extreme, word advice. hope people interact vaccinated. else mitigate accept best? long vaccine prevents COVID deaths, we're starting ""win"". work theme park even ask questions anymore. Grapevine says team members covid one told anything. idea I've exposed not. I'm vaccinated still wear mask. Ironically, people need wear mask will, people need wear mask won't. EU representatives fairness.  based old polii vaccine actually cause shed live virus.

Of course everyone vaccinated much issue.... I'll take it. think it‚Äôs logistics thing. issue took away mask rules made rule change night went place, mess next day employees knowing rules were. gives day get signage parks make sure everyone informed rules are. protect severe disease illness, believed possible spread Delta Variant even vaccinated. prevent spread (both among vaccinated unvaccinated) masks needed again. virus allowed spread unmitigated, threat future variant could evade vaccine protection. I‚Äôm confused sorry isn‚Äôt right place this. watched Fauci video saying Delta variant infect vaccinated people. mean makes sense since vaccines aren‚Äôt 100% effective, let alone variants. But, vaccines prevent severe symptoms long COVID, vaccinated people susceptible too? always impression even unlucky enough get COVID despite vaccinated, protected severe symptoms saw post elsewhere puts notion question could easily made huge profit this...

They couldn't. patent. Oxford University invented vaccine, would give company would commit non-profit approach. Astrazeneca agreed, despite zero experience producing vaccines, hoping massive PR boost (which equals money). fact Astrazeneca went screw Oxford University's fault. workplace allowed vaccinated people stop wearing masks June 8th, sent notice today, July 29th, masks required. I‚Äôm fucking tired this. do, imo, enlist people study they'll get tested every week - vaccinated unvaccinated. guess runs risk skewing extra-cautious would jump chance ensure never get infected, I'm sure big brains CDC could figure details ... care to. company UK provides antibody testing interesting data # Protection following natural data Testing users shared Antibody Duration Immunity Survey see antibody response created natural infection varies symptoms experienced. experienced symptoms mild symptoms affect one‚Äôs daily life may produce detectable IgG antibodies, whereas moderate severe infections typically do. Mild asymptomatic infections also lead slower build antibodies, may detectable 6 8 weeks potentially also say Typical result following natural infection ~ 0.8 ‚Äì 250 U/mL based analysis 72 samples.

For reference, data suggests 98% non-immnocompromised individuals received two doses Pfizer anti-spike antibody concentration U/ml, 69% U/ml.

Of course measuring anti-spike antibodies, overall picture may complex. However seem likely you‚Äôll considerably better double-vaccinated, particularly COVID infection asymptomatic mild. I'm sorry. I'm UK. worth, vocal small minority complaining vaccines. people *rushed* get vaccine moment eligible take streets shout happy it.

It's easy look images demonstrations masks/vaccines/etc. assume represent public feeling. don't, they're nutcases gathered together one place whilst everyone else quietly keeps distance.

I guess one benefit demonstrations attendees getting antibodies case, albeit via dangerous mechanism... peak 50k cases/day ridiculously high considering restrictions vaccination rate (scaled US population would 300k cases/day). many people getting app exposure notifications worried supermarkets would shut one could get food. go relaxing restrictions come back down. India's come surge come down? Even mutates past vaccine you‚Äôll still protected current variants still effecting communities. stay vigilant follow science make decisions based educated discernment. would scaring people benefit way, doubled vaxed, thankfully family OK, caught covid thankfully know anyone died it.

I concerned people know also doubled vaxed catching covid, non hospitalised good news hit pretty fucking hard it. one unvaccined person who's neighbour also hospitalised.

One people doubled vaccinated caught lives next door 83 year old mother COPD regularly house (her mother doubled vaxed.)

It's concerning cases like double vaxed person catch still get bad symptoms meaning possible mother COPD could still catch could fatal. Delta little faster Classic average 3.7 days symptoms. go one Florida based cruises. mean don‚Äôt want responsible people dying, yes.

I really don‚Äôt think get part sucking up. can‚Äôt whine people back life. What‚Äôs legality move like this? isn‚Äôt meaningless less it‚Äôs need wait 13 hours something usually takes hour less. 

You‚Äôre intentionally missing point. It‚Äôs explained three times now; I‚Äôm done. work theater Wisconsin. got PTO hour got go get shot work hours. line long, docked pay. employees recalled office got second shot I‚Äôm sorry don‚Äôt accept idea. mask stop gap vaccines reduce hospitalization. hospitalization isn‚Äôt bad area masking shouldn‚Äôt recommended enforced. Otherwise never get rid mask mandates logic. 93 per cent Dutch people donate blood antibodies blood corona thanks infection vaccination. Every week, Sanquin Blood Bank tests portion blood donations antibodies.

The antibodies blood, better protected corona infection. chance become seriously ill end hospital small. Good news according OMT [Outbreak Management Team] member Marc Bonten, mean group immunity? policy relaxed quickly?

First figures:

[Antibodies per age high percentage mainly due explosive growth vaccinated people twenties recent weeks,"" says Hans Zaaijer, physician-microbiologist researcher blood bank.

""The funny thing is: number people antibodies went slowly first,"" says Zaaijer. ""But mid-April June, suddenly went 5 percent week. new now, also see graph, coming standstill, even among people twenties. levelling off, reaching ceiling. makes sense, pretty much over.""

OMT member Marc Bonten also thinks wonderful figures. ""In quarter, number antibodies gone 20 90 per cent, almost due vaccinations. phenomenal.""

Comments

There comments made figures. entirely representative. example, blood donors age 18. also hardly donors age 75, groups migration background strongly underrepresented (more details study found box bottom article). Incidentally, according RIVM, 40 percent 12- 17-year-olds already vaccinated one shot.

""For whole Netherlands, number people antibodies still somewhat lower,"" says Bonten. ""But cases means large proportion Dutch people protected.""

[Antibodies though time antibodies have, better protected virus. fact many Dutch people antibodies mean still year now. ""We see extra accurate tests number antibodies halves every three four months,"" says Zaaijer. ""What see yet disappear completely. Whether eventually happens, we'll wait see.""

But even without antibodies, left so-called memory cells vaccination infection. ""How well protect long term determined two ways,"" says Zaaijer. ""We know hepatitis B virus, example, bad thing antibodies drop off. Even thirty years, memory cells still good enough, start making antibodies infection occurs.

For flu, example, different. ""It case many respiratory infections, might consider booster. careful that, time tell.""
Group immunity nightclubs?

With high percentage antibodies, might think: group immunity almost there, throw everything back open. OMT member Bonten want go far. ""We soon able slowly start releasing measures. June, step big. worried relaxations many unprotected people, would still wave hospitals. current measures, seem happening.""

According Bonten, cabinet OMT - especially rapid easing June - little cautious taking big steps. ""Look, still part youth vaccinated. open nightclubs now, schools higher education summer - that's lot once. know relaxations faster now.""

On August 13, cabinet come update relaxations. ""But everything points going right direction.""

Accountability

Sanquin receives 15,000 blood plasma donations per week, approximately half blood donations. Every week, company measures 2,000 corona antibodies. 2,000 distributed representatively age, gender postal code. Sanquin blood people age 18 hardly people age 75. addition, Dutch people migrant background strongly underrepresented, donate blood less often.

Sanquin distinguish antibodies due vaccination antibodies due infection. order check figures, compare results first group RIVM figures number people first injection. margin, similar, indicates Sanquin figures good indication number Dutch people antibodies.

The RIVM also conducts research antibodies PIENTER study. recent research conducted end June, Nieuwsuur unable view results yet. 100% protection B. alone. people can't receive it, punished health issues, preventing virus continuing mutate moron antivaxxers there's nothing says next mutation WONT protected vaccine.


In addition, sine still get it, even nearly bad, someone would still work two weeks til gone. current climate many people afford two weeks unpaid?

This one trade offa living society. Sometimes something greater good. get vaccinated go public school college. can't go 90 residential neighborhood. wear pants grocery store. 

People need get themselves. fine ""how know safe"". makes sense. point know... ""You can't tell do!"" good enough. Mask normal. medical school I'm sure taught properly wear mask right ? think general public knows proper way wear mask? think they're wearing N95? live echo chamber. Guarantee drowning debt, love Bernie Sanders, weight, terrible relationship dad. Haha traits medicated, depressed little man. doubt it. Haha must suck. Yeah, vaccines already widely accepted intelligent people, saying makes sense anti vaxxer. case, feel bad you. ""real"" conservative would ok local government mandating health protocols backed science?

I mean anything state prevents overreach conservative stop viral load reused? mask clean stopped deadly virus, shoved pocket, worn without washing?

Better messaging would help mitigate limit freedom based bad science encouraged rational thinking person.


The science fine buddy. messaging issue. Especially state actively stifles opposes guys though. know laughing history kind irrational behavior. Sacrificing freedoms everyone illusion security cowardly play.

Funny, think irrational protect non existent freedoms. India went 450k cases day May 40 lower vaccination rates even worse US state. Seems like good sign? good showing data claiming viral load vaccinated unvaccinated people, without showing data.  making people question said OK unmask vaccinated can't. Yes exactly‚Ä¶.I‚Äôve seen arguments vaccine causing mutations ""Everything good""

Except examples blood clots women viral vector vaccines myocarditis young men mRNA vaccines. 

Yes, extremely rare phenomenon. zero risk.

Being skeptical good thing, people chastised it. talk doctors, discuss risk/reward personal situation make decision comfortable with. would probably take vaccine discussion. Apparently supposed happy go along restrictions due anti vaxxers selfishness. That's interpreted it.  Right. get many people coming clinics saying ‚Äúthe system‚Äù‚Ä¶ can‚Äôt pull file etc. magic data cloud everyone‚Äôs id/insurance record. need provide physical copy entered computer system us records. information pertains visit clinic. also give consent us obtain medical records providers. turn people away don‚Äôt proof identification. Working healthcare really frustrating sometimes. keep reminding ignore CDC guidance every time eat hamburger cooked medium. perfect virus would one kills one, remains resistant immunity enough continually infect everyone. depressing show year half covid praise mega corps got taking symbolic measures like masks still providing sick pay. get wrong, gonna painfully slow process time depending area. like May, think mask mandates get rescinded coming back. people stop relying CDC that's it. You‚Äôre obviously welcome believe whatever please, brother. Respectfully, less duplicitous reasoning behind opinions might probably wouldn‚Äôt discussion otherwise. ;) Russians manage sell Sputnik around $20 so. Oh, think misunderstood comment. thought saying masks use all; therefore, wear them. 

That's bad! Maybe wasnt specifically asymptomatic ""vaccinated"" people delta. could mix asymptomatic symptomatic I'll take Things Never Happen $1000, Alex actually best idea I‚Äôve heard far. makes logical sense. Vaccinated people deserve reimbursed need shut again. Thank extra bit info. asked someone question recently (about full FDA approval) said, ""I'd research, would suddenly approve approved before???""

Those folks morons. think they're making decision based ""rare"" occurrence, also fact cases spiking place. supposed woods instead we're facing fourth wave. specific companies, working office operationally necessary all, take chance - seems prudent get people buses/trains/out city need right now. odds ten people office, nine vaccinated one not? 

Would like know odds week, two week etc. work together, sit close other, etc. missing point. Saying ER wait times 10 hours meaningless. 

What ER wait times also 10 hours 2019? 2018? 2015? 2010?

You need comparative data point show ER wait times higher due COVID always been. Unfortunately, latest talk track around vaccinated people spreading virus fuel anti-vax sentiment. logic ""well still get spread either way, anyone care decide to.

The reality much different despite confusing narrative.

Here's quote CDC director:  ""Information Delta variant several states countries indicates that, rare occasions, vaccinated people infected Delta variant vaccination may contagious spread virus others"" 
 
So ""some"" vaccinated people, all, MAY contagious.....in RARE occasions.

But look new recommendations subsequent actions many municipalities businesses already starting take, would think Delta spread among vaccinated people lot rare. HIV extremely high death rate untreated. There's people affect, likely kills 100% people otherwise. Italy completely fucked PR stunt. leaked news phone calls politicians illegally hoarding vaccines giving ""friends friends"" instead eligible people, said politicians go TV unapologetic and/or fiercely deny involvement even tv host played back recording.

I guarantee 98% boomers would vaxxed this. mainly listens to/watches prosperity gospel programs, also deeply infused politics. never fan mandated vaccines time goes Americans shown ignorant selfish right thing get vaccinated started lean towards supporting mandate. I'm done lockdowns, restrictions masks. vaccine time stop punishing everyone selfish choices spoiled anti vax brats. Exactly. risk post-viral syndrome infection going 0% / unless medical science determines happens treat it. whole results seem encouraging me. think get it. honestly think much time think see possible negative side effects across population. 7 months since first people got vaccines, longer trials.

There one magical moment it'll 100% clear whether gotten vaccinated. it'll get covid, case it'll late get vaccinated. Getting married 9 days. feel you. OH feel you. Everyone keeps asking I'm excited answer become ""No, legit want anxiety burning out."" 

I think next month two going game changing, though. know live, NY vaccination numbers notably increased within past week (my fiance obsessive checking numbers daily basis, obvious reasons). FDA approval coming hopefully soon, happens private companies feel comfortable mandating vaccine. although think things get worse next weeks, think it'll start stabilize fall. 

Congrats, btw! FDA gets authorized, mandate private businesses, schools medical settings least. 

‚Ä¶.Seat belts, seemed hard sell beginning. still remember. Smoking restrictions indoors, nice change was. longer trapped plane office smokers, it‚Äôs great. Put life danger, mine.

Thanks insight changed opinion  Thank I‚Äôm club, kind of. entire family COVID vaccinations, several flat anti vax. got vaccinated secret didn‚Äôt say shit month. family member started sharing conspiracy BS me, told stop spreading disinformation already vaccinated. person hasn‚Äôt spoken since.

This literally nothing all. absolute waste time, pure theater. So? it‚Äôs still like flu way. It‚Äôs completely different kind virus, extremely contagious, lead long-term health issues, still spread vaccinated people. kids 12 can‚Äôt even vaccinated yet deadly typical flu. It‚Äôs spreading like crazy US get worse schools open. Driving variants also bad idea everyone. take practical steps like wearing masks inside areas benefit everyone? absolutely nothing like typical flu. Ignoring likely bad idea everyone hence new CDC recommendations. true! depictions zombie apocalypses required zombies bite people. could airborne virus VACCINE READILY AVAILABLE zombie virus would still take US. figured click charts read they'll see Believe me, wish financial position quit go back. I'm sure I'm good company issue. family stay afloat work. 

Currently, waiting corporate hopefully come back different decision; maybe extend WFH beginning next year. 

Each day new stories reports coming anxiety level goes up. horrible think choice either paying bills possible death.  Hey works works We'll never hit 100 percent vaxed. Getting 80 double dose still very, good. look mortality rate Covid, past year children, **more twice mortality rate see influenza given year**,"" said CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky CNN's ""New Day"" Wednesday.  number Covid-19 cases children teens trending upwards, according American Academy Pediatrics. group reported 38,600 cases children **from July 15 22, triple** reported end June. Alabama bad?  went &lt;1% chance death &lt;1% chance death. wait still get delta variant spread vaccine totally works. needs everyone. unvaccinated causing mutations. I'm tired people using excuses get free vaccination save millions. I've known people side effects I've also known people pretty bad ones including: vomiting, go A&amp;E stroke like symptoms, fever, diarrhoea menstrual changes resulted heavy bleeding intense cramps. That's you. sickest I've ever 10 years 24 hours 2nd shot. sick day I've ever taken 8 years teaching. Worse flu flu shot I've ever long shot. I'd still get vaccine again, saying side effects like flu shot bit misinforming lot people Nanomachines, son! fuck, Biden specifically said day impossible get covid vaccinated. best part like call ""rebels"" go freedom second someone tries something groupthink... Yes still spread it. friend sick positive covid husband asymptomatic. visited mother 3 days later covid. visitor stupid part.

I would limit exposure others outside world due information.

Oh wife pinged positive rapid negative PCR. Wild. contact got pinged positive PCR. Testing weird, 100% accurate. Neither population monolith. US shoes, would people marching vaccines, Nepal voluntary roll started discussing mandate would protesters marching that. plan looks treading thin ice. Somebody consult lawyer maybe sue asses off. Habilitive services supposed covered. think point long covid like poisoned Smartie (serious negative health outcome) rainy day. previously infected, getting vaccinated boost neutralizing antibody levels. main thing help stop transmission. drop vaccinated people tangible risk spreading it. think smart think are. Lol, ask warming pizza. Haha YES please give phone number use reverse look-up find make sure get credit deserve worlds dumbest person. earned recognition friend.

I‚Äôm average intelligence, you‚Äôre dumb.

I can‚Äôt help notice course don‚Äôt anything say rainy days eh?? valid point virus transmission like thinking. Maybe let actuaries handle it? Inbreeding? private companies please, especially since bribe politicians legally. irony people refusing Vax typically Republican voters, essentially go party corporate power deregulation. can't blame companies US politics.

But blame Astrazeneca unprofessional behaviour /u/marosurbanec listed above. Exactly. Essentially, anyone job dealing customers could exposed every time go work. issue isn‚Äôt recommending daily tests, imo, it‚Äôs fact many governments made tests expensive inconvenient point can‚Äôt realistically get one every day. could get boxes tests conveniently cheaply (at grocery store), gave results quickly, would easy enough incorporate testing morning routine. Test, brush teeth, wash face, get dressed, check test, good go. ideally  back check that? I'd mad people getting vaccinated got 2 days slacking got basically day 1. Evolution goals. Mutations happen ‚Ä¶ benefit mutations determined environment. particular lethal variant tend burn kills host spread. that‚Äôs case COVID well it‚Äôs current variants, deadly, takes days weeks kill host. makes insidious virus. Lol 100% agree! I'm 7 months pregnant got vaccinated 2nd trimester, started wearing mask fast Delta variant RSV spreading at. Sure I'm protected want avoid getting sick cost, I'm going protect step wear mask need go out.

 common misconception vaccines people assume can't get sick they're fully vaccinated, reality safety belt. lowers chances getting sick, never 0%. get sick vaccinated body trained fight virus, symptoms nearly harsh life-threatening. 

So even though fully vaccinated, know live super spreading high populated area 70% refuse even consider vaccination, I'm going wear mask I'm taking risk.
Just personal preference. 

Even covid settles I'm probably going continue wear mask cold flu season time get flu, cold, rsv? me. Context important: true, negligible amount poisoned smarties want smarty. would negligible raise chance rain. sure tells us case.  company gave us PTO get vaccine PTO recover side effects. nice benefit I'm sure swayed motivated people already planning get it. Anti vaxxers seem interested budging. got vaccinated OPV vaccine.

It's mutated get stronger, always chance (1 2.4M) losing mutation introduced make safe, reverting back original wild virus.

The reason used cheaper, also effective IPV vaccine (inactivated virus). long decent chance people encountering real, wild virus, OPV vaccine better effective real live virus, ""infect"" others vaccine bonus.

Once there's close spread real virus, IPV better chance reverting wild paralyzing you. isn‚Äôt welcome believe whatever please. Meh. compel people get kinds vaccines kinds places. I‚Äôm subject law medical tests job. government lot room regulate businesses health reasons. What‚Äôs pedantic thinking haven‚Äôt settled question public health laws comparable civil rights. Make inconvenient people vaccinated . vaccine ? able use essential services grocery stores pharmacy masked . bars , restaurants things nice have. I‚Äôm anti vax all, I‚Äôve fully vaccinated since January. tired though constant peddling vaccine magic silver bullet cures everything protects bad stuff Covid. actually told Russian bot earlier sub. pandemic hospitalizations deaths, right vaccine losing delta. Mask mandates get cannot mandate vaccine. Self-righteous rage seems perpetual state unable get teacher. Paid time sounds great theory work tries enforce ways weekend. Well, bit that. also unplanned work stoppages/shortages happen outbreaks work costly. However, big companies part health plan actually pay portion incurred medical expenses ton employees ventilators would wreck bottom line. I've saying long time combat conservatives vaccine. ""Being vaccine anti-business lazies want 2 weeks getting it."" confirm parents Arkansas like this. Extremely sad it‚Äôs like this, I‚Äôm glad don‚Äôt watch parents suffocate death covid. Seems like lot people done virus long vaccinated. thought done too, fully vaxxed May, trip booked next week.

Just tested positive COVID known exposures people also fully vaccinated. Including myself, personally know 6 people got covid fully vaccinated. cancelled flight I‚Äôm isolation next 10 days. Right? exactly clamoring this? there's people still shell shocked past year, large us vaccinated want this. lord knows unvaccinated people want either. even discussions?

Of course answer power. got give back. mean, get sentiment, I'm way eager go back masks, I'm angry too. data show vaccinated still infect others. pragmatic standpoint, going back masks. Forgoing mask mandates make easier unvaccinated people lie run around spreading it. new variant emerges evade vaccines everyone's problem, unvaccinated. ERs fill up, again, unvaccinated people's problem. fair? Fuck no, not, angry. situation rapidly evolving, people can't get board going drag pandemic even longer.

Ideally waited lift it. keep getting downvoted stance, fuck it, shit like reason Canada(minus Alberta due dumbass policy decisions) much better per capita point, recover better faster end. Exactly, new mask mandate save single life. Walensky zero credibility. Like wtf basing on. That‚Äôs asinine think could even know that‚Äôs case fairness vaccine shedding concept used anti-vaxxers since well existence COVID. absolutely bunk though. Plenty people turn down.

My employer offering everyone $1,500 75% workforce vaccinated end August. $3,000 85%.

As yesterday, we're 46%. 40% two weeks ago.

These people care free money.

Plus UK end school term weeks ago, US kids returning school weeks. Lots fast loose information pushed public usually without controls review yes take reporting Israel grain salt countries larger populations spread publishing information.  Nope, I‚Äôm part crowd got vaccinated protect people, order experimental antiviral called 'DRACO' protect pretty much viruses. 
 
How works instead producing virus specific antibodies attack virus may protect viruses - instead 'DRACO' substance waits body - within bodies cells perhaps - virus infects cell DRACO hijacks virus soon enters cell rewires part virus destroy said infected cell. Virus infects cell, injects virus code cell - DRACO attaches self destruct code onto virus infection code - cell reads virus code see's self destruct code cell thus self destructs. substance designed specifically detect whether infection happens. 
 
So means like substance probably protect flu virus, COVID 19.. Common cold.. Etc.. 
 
Though substance maybe antiviral actual vaccine - still could last maybe actually make DRACO actual vaccine somehow getting body produce DRACO itself.

  ok, let's review chain discussion here.

the comments original discussing (and directly quote) ""whether (govt) still correct encouraging vaccinations"". People mentioned prevention death/hospitalization/severe covid, long covid, yes, breakthrough cases factors consider.

My initial comment: Yes, decision still correct, primarily first reason. alone worth it, even though stats latter two concerns murky now. Hence ""don't let perfection enemy good"".

then came first comment, ""you seen good data prevention death/hospitalization/severe covid"".

next, second comment, brought examples studies showed exactly that.

Then said studies ""doesn't actually talk topic"". What? totally did. ""This topic"" whether vaccines excellent preventing death/hospitalization/severe covid. goalpost gets moved breakthrough cases.

If really want insist studies (as well countless similar studies) actually show vaccines good preventing death/hospitalization/severe covid, afraid burden proof you. That's literally studies about. Dismissing off-hand saying ""I see good data"" nowhere close convincing argument. show either actually read studies, actually understand them, either deliberately unintentionally obfuscated ""prevention death/hospitalization/severe covid"" issue breakthrough cases. It‚Äôs possible there‚Äôs simple explanation: cases spike, people respond caution. happened Sweden announced deranged ‚Äúherd immunity‚Äù strategy, people like ‚Äúuh, thanks‚Äù limited movement interactions. YAWN..... wrong use word. Try looking dictionary. OPV also ideal mass vaccination efforts sterile syringes necessary So, get booster October, not? 6 months past 2nd jab marker. It‚Äôs really deadly begin with, it‚Äôs likely immune systems begin adapt it, I‚Äôm mistaken large part it‚Äôs deadly coronaviruses don‚Äôt real immune reference, body nukes itself. Also people fact waiting approved really believe EUA isn‚Äôt safe know it‚Äôs safe it‚Äôs fully approved. antivaxxers, probably decent amount people. past future, present CDC always right. **was** 100% effective. promise **is be** 100% effective. observation, promise. two different things. reporting around saw careful point distinction. Tell Trump supporting lunatic posing reasonable person without blah blah

Uncle Sam never sending another covid check Tell you‚Äôre Reddit shut without telling you‚Äôre Reddit shut seriously proud out-trailerparking someone? UK isnt even vaccinating 18s say covid poses extremely little risk them. Germany countries made decision. I'm pretty annoyed decision happy see articles. delayed emergency authorization application Q3 Q4. Probably September unless delay again. made statements Delta variant became primary strain US. Like Fauci said, ""the science change, virus did."" Biden said accurate according latest science time. sit one out, champ? I'm thinking kids teens big source exposure. We‚Äôve trying compel people right thing year half almost. What‚Äôs going change now? 314 comments. Nice. strongest suit

Anti-vaxxers 2020: ""I care less stupid virus. got 99.5% survival rate!""

Anti-vaxxers 2021: ""The vaccine 99.998% survival rate! I'm risking life!"" ones involve dead virus. None involve live virus.

Right dead virus still ""the virus"" in, Sars-CoV-2, correct? That's theboss3213 asking. Unfortunately, CDC terrible messaging really told people even vaccinated people likely get Covid, probably multiple times lives.

What lying about? infections rare, breakthroughs also rare. flu mutates awfully quickly part reason vaccine routine annual vaccination. far covid developed bunch mutations show particularly effective escape immune system, possible annual vaccination indicated think early conclude certainly case. assuming every single individual exposed covid-19. employer also requiring supplier contractor vaccinated cannot enter properties. problem aren‚Äôt talking small group people. It‚Äôs better one free beer. bars giving out. Check Dr Joseph Campbell tube theorized mutated based evidence. last tube video yesterday thought talking actual skunk, confused. Covid.is/data answer general stimulus. get vaccinated, get stimulus. Whether get vaxxed tomorrow got vaxxed back January.

Then fair, get holdouts get jabbed. I‚Äôm betting man, but‚Ä¶ point start considering health/safety everyone else mainly focus small percent severely get sick it. Glad recovered well! person works Comp Sci degree, understand logic microchips vaccines. microchips powered? do? big fabrication plant makes them? China Taiwan America? many questions... That's concern too. next time there's pandemic (or boosters needed vaccine resistant variant), people hold knowing longer wait, better incentives are. apparently hundred bucks better incentive dying.

If works gets us this, great. worry we're shooting foot. Building herd immunity hard way. Oh well!  probably charge different rates. health insurance already charges different rates depending things like blood pressure, BMI, cholesterol, smoking history, etc... I'm willing also willing bet most, ones promoting mass death also vaccinated themselves. Good point! never thought that. getting exposed COVID-19 variants fully vaccinated increase immunity disease ? little. vaccinated need articles like motivate them. vaccinated suffer stupidity person, matter affects them. 

Think it. Vaccinations prevent getting sick. End stop. Even anti-vaxxers know this. simply think ramifications getting vaccinated higher negative outcomes taking chances. 

So comes article like justify beliefs reality clash. cognitive dissonance dilemma. 

So reason say, oh take precautions like me, age, strong immune system me, whatever takes consistent currently held views. Must nice.

‚Äî American actual data? hope good sign US. We're getting hammered here; started recommending masks indoors places. [More info per White House shared fact sheet detailing new actions Biden administration taking aim getting Americans vaccinated slowing spread Delta variant.

It's 17.4 right now. first wave peaked 2,100 deaths per day. summer 1,000, highest peak winter 3,000. *lowest* death rate got last year point 700. 

We're currently 250 deaths per day 3% attributed vaccinated people, 8 people per day across country, UK, India, even last year indication we'll start decline within weeks. We'll agree disagree ""chewing vaccinated people."" I‚Äôm sick people insisting coddle idiots choose vaccinate. Like wtf?!? could wait state offers payments getting vaccinated, want leave money one table going early. wear fucking mask inside close people, hard people? vaccinated people ar still getting hospitalized

We know vaccines work 100%. literally every single person UK vaccinated, 100% hospitalized patients would vaccinated, even dozen people entire country. 

Look raw numbers. Percentages easily skewed fit narrative. mask protect me, protect you. known that, let's go backwards it. Anti-vaxxers using argument--if want forego mask, business. Well, no. business putting risk. survive antivax/antimask demise. Thanks Nope people power take fuck would I

lead example Ohio states showed offering monetary incentive works. problem was, least Ohio getting people show second shot. give cash incentive per shot, going people lining up. feels much like brainer want increase vaccination rates. That's dumb. US HIPAA covers people trying get info vaccinated. I'm clear this. quarantine get tested, get tested quarantine unless test positive. Imagine secretly believe science cultist family hate accept never gonna end restrictions permanent specially North America US canada Nobody forcing get vaccinated. businesses communities able decide wish serve don't. end goal get people vaccinated, seems agree with, fortunately majority informed citizens do.

Thanks internet outrage though! Cool, bunch federal jobs available shortly. mask mandate there, either, except public transit. seems like numbers vary low 35% asymptomatic people high 88% symptomatic people accuracy detecting COVID. 0 congestion couldnt smell damn thing. even hint right next nose. like smell censors ripped completely mean could different things. obese doesn‚Äôt mean ‚Äúcatch‚Äù obesity you; don‚Äôt endanger others. covid means catch though - risk one multiplicative one other. Hard argue this. Crime humanity, 30 year smoker. Quit 15 years ago. Still get desire while, stayed them. Can‚Äôt wrap head around cigs still legal (other obvious financial backing fear national withdrawal symptom], got hooked. way taken reason get vaccine. fact, reality opposite.

I'm fully vaccinated - need money could care less

couldn't*  loss taste smell terrifies me. hope get back. Acknowledge breakthrough infections happen. People continue simple steps like better hand hygiene. showing symptoms test. Populations able vaccinate (children 12, example) exercise simple restraint. Continued vaccine education *reachable* unvaccinated populations.

Nothing drastic. prudent pretend COVID gone. supposed attend baseball game Saturday birthday. first major event since March 2020 first time I‚Äôve seen closest friends since then.

Yes true public health official. gist argument public health officials act that, they're tasked providing overly conservative (logistically speaking) recommendations political leaders. tasked weighing pros cons extraneous sociopolitical ramifications goal. 

So then, political leaders take this, arbitrarily blindly enforce recommendations seemingly absolute authority. guise public security incident (Covid), since mostly routed. dont take account instance, fact reintroduction mask mandate, slight inconvenience most, likely precipitate significant % decrease revenue local businesses.

This made worse fact actually, wholeheartedly care health population case. Bowser appeal wide audience people like you, fall line seems overwhelmingly politically based issue moment. people still downplaying effects COVID children smh I‚Äôm vaccinated , taking precautions people choose comparatively low risk area , long going masks considering people simply aren‚Äôt going change ways.

It well known put ventilator suffer cognitive deficits time recovery also think ample evidence multiple states show vaccines work well, shown significant health safety issues. I'm hearing colleagues companies starting make mandatory require proof vaccination.

More people continue get vaccinated day data UK accurately describes wave look like us, hospitalizations deaths follow trajectory cases‚Äî good thing. true, guess trying get point‚Äîwhich likely still year probably away‚Äîpeople, including people making decisions, start care less less CDC guidelines Covid becomes endemic.

Good point. I‚Äôve 100% following guidelines clear goals CDC saying shit vacuum ignoring economic sociological implications. 

But CDC also thinks steak well done basically never ever come contact sunlight. ever end all. People may infected earlier gathering euros, already exposed time final, also delta exposure may lead quicker infection earlier development symptoms (I can‚Äôt dig reference atm I‚Äôve seen quick 30 hours exposure). delta super spread event could theoretically peak sooner events we‚Äôve seen involved slower variants? Lol worries. nice feel relieved once. ""Mom, Dad, something tell you....""

""You tell us anything, hon.""

""I....i got covid vaccine.""

Currently worried protecting newborn. Thank intel. efficacy vaccines aside moment, half population running around lying vaccine status avoid masks threatening future efficacy current vaccinations - time go back them, least prevent that. 

I follow logic though, like policy makers people upset still voluntary lockdown far removed society point forgotten human nature. people dishonest lying would follow mask guidelines *now?* Think that.

You people like strictly adhered resistant seems illogical, informed responsible ones along point, yet somehow expect antivaxxers antimaskers get board comply even side expressing resistance? see effect causing division hostility among people little real world effect ground.

These people simply plebs street, they're business owners, politicians, law enforcement, etc. mechanism policy recommendation expected enforced?

That's big part find frustrating. agree maybe CDC never changed guidelines back May cat left bag now. I'm going stop smoking cigarette responsibly put butt I'm done watch people commit arson across street (again respect private policies personal respect, longer actually believe reasoning).

To like strictly law abiding citizen saying order prevent criminals breaking law simply need laws ignoring fact party question never followed begin with, effect people follow new laws ones following old ones along. afraid stay home. Let kids get back school. I‚Äôve people tell aren‚Äôt putting toxic shit (vaccine) body puffing Marlboro. rather say 100,000 people basics, think better 1,000 even more? would never that, definitely wear asked. wear mask willfully certain indoor settings seem like good idea, forced mandate. don‚Äôt think many enforce seems lot backlash. base on? following vaccination curve all, hence ""something strange"" headline. makes quite angry people ‚Äòforget‚Äô bad things like Polio were; real pandemic born. problem unvaccinated children swept this. Nonetheless model seems default model US. fear children face present future US unite fixing SOMETHING.

And people keep fighting need keep wearing masks even vaccinated.

Or better yet, go effing cruise. couple years ago could easy noro virus break them. covid asking disaster. currently vaccine 67% effective vs Delta 2nd dose, reduction 3-4% every month per current data. 8 months assuming best case 3% reduction per month 52% effectiveness enough prevent spread mutation.

It actually harm good 'many' vaccinated people running around without masks spreading virus. Look UK numbers. death rate cases high? low now? changed?

Literally open book read yourself. new recommendations specifically protect people done nothing protect others last year half. get want save lives, hard time caring people actively choosing vulnerable getting vaccinated.   think boss would let me. would pay thousands booster get first, health wealth. cares? Case rate relevant anymore. Deaths are. Deaths down. Yup, lead carrot stick approach. People respond positive reinforcement much negative. Yup. I've telling people past week.

This devolve political hate fest. scientific literacy important.  virus able shed vaccinated people get others sick

is several steps beyond actually know. know small, yet published research showed levels virus measured throat nose vaccinated covid patients. 

#  understand irritating others - I'm even saying measure ought stay place. *am* saying OPs implication retention mask mandates places means going live perpetual restrictions rest lives is, bluntly, completely insane. one impregnates other, let know two days perfect birth... happens radical individualist society. ignorance valid knowledge.

Oh that's good one. I'm stealing one. Question though. pandemic going year, hell hospitals prepared surges patients now?

Thank you.  understand it... &lt;-- Hey, presented official medical data analysis, rather integration information assembled mode accessible laypeople. may incorrect, presented incorrectly, date. Consult physician medical advice, not.

Initially correct. greater virus count initial exposure headstart virus immune system. Breathing virus applied directly contact vulnerable cells bad, accumulate damage even thoroughly vaccinated. immune system vaccines mostly work building ""antigens"" cling virus ""spike"" virion uses inject (mostly lung) cell. applying virus directly cell antigen get chance intercept virion blunt virus cell cell. Apparently takes 38 days regenerate alveoli cells lungs, something body always does, want kill many fast. wear respirator going around unvaccinated people, vaccinated people, cats dogs species known carry shed virus. keep direct damage down.

Once number cells lungs infected produce virus die, releasing virus general area blood. vaccinated\* recently antigens blood chance blunt virus based level antigens proportion number virions. Elsewhere body cells called T-cells B-cells sense repetition prior attack produce appropriate antigens, suddenly feel little ill.

Later depth illness depend factors like weakened immune system age, conditions, medications. battle rages body's frailties general endurance come play. young immune system overreaction called cytokene storm also come play body begins attacking urgency rid virus.

Businesses already decimated here; I'd hate think would happen 'stay home' orders even work last time. chart shows vaccination rate number vaccinated divided number (vaccinated + unvaccinated).

It also shows number completed rounds. asked above: ""Are numbers behind vaccinated vs unvaccinated""

Yes. it. 


It change rapidly though. interesting number current rate would indicate. little, late - United States completely bungled pandemic response

The book writes itself.  Good thing lifted mask mandates. Definitely huge number viruses cause serious health damage. vaccinated healthy individual virus particularly bad. high risk kids option vaccinated yet. know daughter one. Masks big deal. CDC awful this. It‚Äôs honestly pathetic. bad live anything resembles functional democracy. Unfortunately, tried recently Netherlands [it didn‚Äôt work essential worker required go office non essential mandatory personal choice since cases still high. reduce everyone called back it'll bad look study? study 23 people?

With 80% vaccination rate, virus spread much much less. Best case, becomes much less deadlier (currently least 10x flu) learn deal it. good next year.

From read, least new mRNA vaccines reworked pretty quickly deal mutation escapes.

Even vaccination, keep wearing N95s indoor situation becomes better. gets worse US, Canada need keep border closed quite awhile. Today 6 month-iversary second Pfizer shot. I‚Äôm ready booster. üëç No, mandated vaccines federal state facilities hospitals, schools. (I would never support mandatory population vaccine). force people get vaccinated order gain admission facilities need 
Doctors around world disagree ain‚Äôt good all. get fucking boosters? hate shit. I‚Äôm sure though result contagious it‚Äôs actually causing higher proportion kids get really sick. Either way, sucks kids eligible shots me. records missing reasons get bunch shots again. Border controls help short term highly transmissible variant eventually make way unless Australia/NZ shut completely world. 

Also, living neighboring Singapore, foolproof option us even severely limited travel countries. share cultural economic ties Indonesia watching situation closely know if/when new variant emerges there, right firing line. Singapore provided medical equipment Indonesia, rapidly vaccinating population mitigate severe outcomes much possible neighborhood pretty scary days. That‚Äôs company working vaccinate pigs.

Maybe Cyrillic? experts believe ‚Äúmutate become less deadly‚Äù theory. It‚Äôs like there‚Äôs spike virus says ‚Äúkill human‚Äù virus drops mutates isn‚Äôt necessary. 

A virus kills people overwhelms body, mutate severity assists transmission. Covid pressure doesn‚Äôt exist, there‚Äôs reason get less deadly time. Nobody poor go somewhere already go time get vaccination. live pretty poor area. one grocery store town lot poor people. aren‚Äôt poor people starve death. Everyone good. Want know get vaccinated? grocery store. pharmacy across street, pharmacy mile street. 

The idea someone poor spend hour getting vaccine twice month absurd.

Still seeing 50% mask usage local shops (100% staff usage).

My local pubs (of several) mostly still mandating staff wear masks, customers masking-up optional. Mask adoption outdoors close zero. Indoors still maybe 50% moving about, zero seated (that part changed).

No pubs requiring signing track &amp; trace anymore (or they've stopped enforcing it).

This rural area, shops use villages/""towns"" less 10k pop. Pubs small rural villages. Vaccines end game. Sadly us playing game put nicknames. would want see someone step take charge. Like building collapse north Miami, instead stepping saying going hold investigation - DeSantis simply said mayor would handle it.

A good take charge person would said, yes Florida building codes kind lay law. 

It occurs he's right person deal kind crisis. mean ""caused"" problem.

But rather make names, I'd look decides pass on. Here's Miami paper put it:

(I kidding) hobbies--in case, reading teaching sew--are solitary ones. What, norovirus good enough you? /s live bit north Atlanta amount people wearing masks almost none.

I walked grocery stores rare see another person wearing mask‚Ä¶ given happen. worst-case scenario acknowledging realm possibility, all. unlikely, however, especially unlikely we'll end back square one. current (and still growing) immunities vaccines recovered cases largely continue make world population increasingly resistant covid. resistant, quickly get there, subject lot variables, including mutations, continue trend right way.

Alberta (Canadian Province) real-world up-to-date data manufacturer overall efficacy vs. variant summary popping sub enough times, I've realized people spend much time obsessing virus they've stirred full panic consumes every waking minute lives.

I lot idiot friends vaccines. use ""vaccines obviously work still get corona pass others wear masks"". ""Whats point? would inject something potentially harm we're going get results"". That's think important public announcements benefits vaccines need hype vaccines instead trying bring down. 

Either way focus mandating vaccinations undermining vaccines. should. also seatbelts protect wearer. Masks protect around wearer. current hotspots? Wow, first person I've heard actually getting something them. also mess internet. stories certainly real, report people life breakthrough infections probably also noticing life may exposed didn't. internet stories probably fabricated exaggerated (folks got cold assumed covid) impossible tell many. generally seems like trend push anecdotes actual data.

The less people listen health Secretaries, Fauci, cdc, etc better be. No. spread equally *when infected*. Protection infected somewhere 66-88% delta. fix boosters. Thanks! new variant evades vaccine antibodies, booster shot going help all. We'll need new edited vaccine, need tested etc. researchers found kids COVID-19 seasonal flu similar rates hospitalization, admission intensive care units (ICUs) ventilator average age children hospitalized differed: average child hospitalized COVID-19 10 years age, kids hospitalized flu average 4 years COVID-19 patients, 17% ended needing hospitalization, including nearly 6% admitted ICU 3% put Among flu patients, 21% hospitalized, 7% admitted ICU, 2% put ventilators, according study published online Sept. 8 JAMA Network Open. realise countries ID vote solved problems right? Thanks! know would definitely pop Kaiser's records, got J&amp;J CVS did. I've asked titer check immunity status, I'll see doctor says that. actually want protect unmasked/unvaccinated people, need wearing N95 KN95. Otherwise mask mostly theater.

Thats false. multiple reports showing cloth masks quite effective (50%+), especially multiple layer ones getting 80%+. Right isn‚Äôt question whether vaccines continue maintain significant protection future variants? Q? What‚Äôs study you‚Äôre citing sure getting away it.


I would like know more. different antibody test used determine prior infection response vaccination. tests look antibodies different proteins. vaccines mandated 100% campus population vaccinated, what‚Äôs point mandating masks?

So COVID-negative people interact people know large, large majority COVID-negative? Please dont apologize 

I dont think said anything bad medical field. even did, fine. People need realize doctors (nurses etc) human too. like Frank, dont know everything, even though prevailing trend ""trust science"" ""doctors educated""

.... last point. Yes educated, again, infallible experts subject matters. imagine poor people tend Republicans rural states, minorities, 24.  would take studies determine main factor, there‚Äôs really data available statistician test, far I‚Äôm aware. Pro Tip: coming bad faith position literally science saying masking lockdowns work, yes big number credibility arguments. hate phrase ‚Äúlisten Science‚Äù. Science listening trusted authority; challenging testing every assumption.

Within right context methodology, yes.

But also rallying cry cranks contrarians want profit advocating scientifically unsupported unreasonable positions like global warming denialism, anti-vax, quack medicines, etc.

When idea becomes part mainstream scientific consensus, already gone tremendous amount challenging testing people qualified so. always remote possibility new data undermining consensus changing peoples' minds, scientists blind that, ideas reach point consensus *vast majority* calling ""challenge every assumption"" actually looking ignore science altogether justify something would bad idea according best available science. know people hesitant first, uptake high confident it. see media focusing stopping vaccines. consume news? He‚Äôs pretty spot on. First off, calm fuck mate. You‚Äôre gonna spent TRILLIONS keep us afloat. That's trillions could spent next decade. think cost that? 

Of course there‚Äôs cost it. lockdowns sucked bad effects. mentioned children losing year proper education, significant.

The question whether better worse alternative. guarantee multi-million dead, destroyed hospital system situation would worse bad effects lockdown. think wouldn‚Äôt major economic impact idk tell clearly pulled ***

I‚Äôm citing psychiatric admissions, new therapist clients, etc. Ontario, quantifiable difference mental health problems found. wanna go self-reported stats, hope carry logic long Covid 200-300k excess deaths even account covid. 

No, aren‚Äôt. lives saved lockdown.

What point? would preferred? lockdowns? masking? fuck curb one infectious diseases human history? data certainly doesn‚Äôt side effects significant felt years come, many effects still felt.

Just like would‚Äôve happened letting Covid run rampant, except worse. ‚Ä¶that LITERALLY reason everything shut first instance. Bloody hell. hope make this, it‚Äôs insane.

Take care man. Yes Pfizer's six month data large trial. Moderna's trial month behind think. expect similar numbers.  Sorry implied blame medical field, meant say perhaps process terminology different resulting potential differences viewpoint misunderstanding approach etc part ""scientist' vs medical scientist. lot respect field overall disappointment whole, course disappointment different members field. ban unvaccinated people participating. Making life inconvenient possible let rest us fucking live. side on? individuals right choose happens body, not?

Really feels like you‚Äôre playing sides here.. Hasn‚Äôt happened yet. They‚Äôve sent hotspots nation wide (the US military runs one largest hospital systems world), mask mandates NPI‚Äôs place.

Texas, North Dakota change stance putting FEMA request.

Makes sense too, could send enough troops meet demand week, cases doubling almost weekly you‚Äôd worse straights days military presence w/o NPI‚Äôs would make things worse would allow delay emergency actions two weeks more. So, vaccinated people spread delta easily unvaccinated people, mean efficacy infection 0%? know entire family right now. üòê like 20 people. wonder they‚Äôll bringing covid back Chicago them. Meanwhile, office providing free passive aggression don‚Äôt want to. pro life party til born eh fuck . growth ain't thing now?

Half population fully vaccinated now, another 8% one shot, third unvaccinated immunity prior infection. March 2020 despite headlines say, breakthroughs rare. county one orange worse northeast, fuck Suffolk Yes, does. Pro Tip: Randomly calling someone anti-masker invalidate arguments. Okay, slow spread. take masks off. cases go back put again. It'll keep going like reach kind herd immunity. let go? turns true infected vaccinated people spread virus much unvaccinated people, really nothing do. rip-off man. haven‚Äôt noticed signal improvements shot. know go forever right? compare? Kids don‚Äôt end ventilators flu. Every single wave peaked 6-7 weeks US wave. 

Its MN generalized whole US. TLaw super bowl? Still even true anywhere reality lab. people symptoms stay home rarely spread it, vaccinated, idea spreading like wildfire making Delta main strain, screaming anyone refuses get vaccine still fully tested, clearly effective enough actually real impact long term. people actually received Moderna one compared Pfizer It‚Äôs really hard understand. kids wear mask go school responsible adults get vaccinated, problem shrinks manageable level. think need look hospitalization

From ""our goal prevent deaths"" ""idk reduce hospitalizations.""

Fucking kill I'm sick shit. Potential bias reviewing officially, that's one thing, unofficially same. Peer reviewers typically selected committee, experts specific research field analogous research paper's focus, approved editor. least field, medical could different. experts CDC potentially qualified peer review research expertises, official review process important one. said, CDC experts said base decisions preliminary data make educated guesses using professional experience, authority, current events, imo would fine different situation. Instead saying ""the science"" says rather upfront telling us really going on. want us blindly trust ""the science"" without citing scientific data research. would tryst upfront honest actual process. times life isn‚Äôt fair. I‚Äôve fully vaxed pay idiots get it, fine. don‚Äôt care 3 swings miss. CNN gets close comparing age groups, since elderly gotten shots, that's still underlying problem 44% people getting vaccinated.

He‚Äôs entirely. He‚Äôs basing sheer prevalence virus country currently lack testing. suggests currently far cases reported therefore likely thick wave rather beginning. hope happens.

Believe opt keep jobs. talk tough lol. TLDR: people fucking morons  probably make progress 24. sure much convincing done Republicans Black/Hispanic. seem kind trenched in. Im pretty sure almost every state registry. Vaccines accepted norm need tracked decades. Pretty much public schools require proof enroll example. 2 5 here. Let tell why.  

More studies need done regards benefits natural recovery. According recent study:  expected, SARS-CoV-2 antibodies plummeted four months infection. *But decline slowed, 11 months infection, researchers could still detect antibodies recognized SARS-CoV-2 spike 

Those naturally recovered covid-19 may detectable antibodies 11 months, may also able produce antibodies life seems antibodies produced bone marrow.  

Prior Delta, natural recovery par vaccination. need vaccine. 

With Delta, one safe. beginning, Delta infected recovered vaccinated peoples, yet decided drop precautions. matter mandate vaccines, people get infected.

And what's long term studies Covid-19 kids show? Say 5-10 50 years now?


And flu. We're fine covid 50x deadly is... Cases going go long time - like diseases. can‚Äôt revert back ore-vaccine measures every time happens. move realistically? Fauci even articles written 

Do mind linking articles? go state, would know? could go get one NYC, live NJ doubt records there. situation real neuroticism help one. I‚Äôd like see major airlines require either proof vaccination negative COVId test order fly. would really make people run get shots. says ‚Äòor‚Äô, ‚Äòand‚Äô article.  south could chosen get vaccinated chose atleast states put effort responsible. make 12 bottom 16 states vaccination rate. Every single state South bottom half vaccination rate country spare me. reason pay obese peoples' heart attacks, smokers' lung cancer, etc.  oh crap lol wrong date! March 29th. convention I‚Äôm going later year requiring proof vaccination masks although said rules could change anything subject health guidelines. Curious want go office simply day vaccinated? companies offer wfh see people saying well get vaccinated even fact work home. Irony: FB employees start quoting anti vax postings. I‚Äôm top-10 vaccination state I‚Äôm still jelly. Yeah - rare. like rare kid gets covid end ventilator. Third shot free assume. Time make money. Two shots fine. stuff going get stretched nsd over. got vaccines good can't continue worry this. People get vaccines let deal point we're approaching two years. local pharmacy today, bunch people getting first second doses vaccine talking they‚Äôre worried Delta anxious get shots.

It looks like Delta unsung hero drove people get vaccinated. course care employees. expensive hire good talent companies like Google treat well. Could post source claim?

&amp;#x200B;

The thing I've read Pfizer ready give 3rd dose shot people (what probably calling booster).

Furthermore, real new booster could come time soon ones targeting South Africa variant, may already know, longer problem... we're twice likely die horrible. evolutionary pressures still same. guarantee multi-million dead

This conjecture many dead would without lockdowns. People social distance wear masks without told to. Sweden restrictions, still saw dramatic drop patronage many stores. 

Would died? Sure. many more? evidence lockdowns anything except delay cases/deaths pretty weak. lockdown Sweden even top 30 deaths per capita. 

We might extra 300-500k deaths, time we'd lot less excess deaths due lack health care. health care system close overrun beginning, really certain areas. wanna go self-reported stats

I literally quoted data. up. Dramatically, many studies confirm US. 200-300k excess deaths even account No, aren‚Äôt. lives saved lockdown.

I think understanding I'm saying. Based death rates, people died year expected - 300k more. that's covid deaths. deaths likely due people staying home going checkups, delaying surgeries, general avoiding health care lock downs. conjecture - data lot deaths expected - that's **after** account 500k/600k dead covid. fuck curb one infectious diseases human history?

Infectious? Sure. Deadly? even remotely close. factor like, 50x. Spanish Influenza killed 20-50 **million** people. Even literally every single person country got covid, death toll even close high. Sit read history get perspective **not** deadly disease is. big diseases past 100-200 years, far least lethal. 

Again, lockdowns mean people take precautions. I'm sure without government lockdowns, would seen dramatic shift behavior simply due covid deadly elderly pre-existing conditions. Again, look Sweden death tolls. Obviously population density same, certainly 500k jump 5M. simply evidence that. Bet I‚Äôll drink GP? Yes, infected still spread mask on. Much less likely still possible. go make sure wearing well fitting mask properly double mask/use n95 etc. ‚ÄúNothing see here. Please disperse.‚Äù ~ Ron DeSantis One thing sure. round mask mandates won‚Äôt nearly wide spread face much resistance officials. Even Texas mask mandate last year implementing one year. Ohio. mixed year. Viruse evolution like human evolution x10000000 (speed-wise time-wise). echo poster said. similar reaction Pfizer got much better I'd fruit juice, ginger ale, sports drinks even chicken soup.   Vaccines work like antibiotics.  lived/hid KL March 2020 May year. definitely 'English' SE Asian country I've to. Obviously 'English' New Zealand, lot China, South Korea, Cambodia, Thailand, Vietnam. Malaysia strong links Singapore Indonesia, bordering them, plus many Malaysians native Chinese. add make strategically (and geographically) important region. complicated that.

One study indicated real world efficacy Janssen vaccine 76.7%.

""This corresponds vaccine effectiveness 76.7% (95% CI: 30.3-95.3%) preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection onset least two weeks recent statement delta variant included mention neutralizing antibody response vaccine decrease actually continues increase 8 months.

Dude, know ends. It‚Äôs going Supreme Court. wonder 6 conservative judges going think lol? Also noteworthy: Nats playing Phillies Philly since Monday.

Please trying pretend major portion 72 million voters, wear $5 mask could pick store prefer. There's also lot live South. graphic pointing two months later, statement actually made? Nicely done. Well, gotta #1 something, guess.  Hmm....but Facebook anything spread antivax propaganda. survived diseases death rates 50x higher. We're fine.

""We"" fine we're descendents ones survived diseases. succumbed would say otherwise. lucky work company actually seems care. Isn‚Äôt hypothetical third dose given company location first two? vaccine best tool have, none states vaccinated enough tool. 

There already good amount studies suggest seeing would happen. really ""new data"" vaccinated people spread virus. rate efficacy known back around 70%. 

The new data came tell people get vaccinated high enough rates. Um, way past peak ever Florida right now‚Ä¶the situation BAD, worst ever near peak. sucks vaccinated people (I one) also risk infection (no studies published yet long term effects post vaccine) well new variants could evade immune response. Hindi leters ‚ÄúWhat need show prove eligible vaccine?
Proof eligibility identification required vaccination sites. Unlikely, fines mandates MLB vaccines far. MLB conservative leagues. Best high five. 7 day death average, one. Arkansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Florida, Tennessee.

You got tho. Always wrong word. almost every wave around world (less certain states United states specifically states ignore context phase waves winter surge) trend 6-7 weeks. better? second shots early February. Perfect timing. look flu vaccinations USA (some years 100+ million doses) flu death rates, seems little effect. justification changes 1) isn‚Äôt bad 2) risk people aren‚Äôt getting it, iffy fuck.

We realistically revamped hvac systems country uv sterilizers pm 2.5 filters. viral load implies similar infectiousness.

Unless study controlled age factors, meaningless indeed unsurprising. Vaccines reduce infection large factor, reduce severe outcomes (including contagiousness) infected small factor. second factor much smaller age-related risk factors. put even simply, UK [under-50 unvaccinated people lower CFR over-50 vaccinated would expected likewise higher viral loads. really bad reaction first vaccine. take month work.

They afraid fear drives vehemence reaction. louder voice, greater fear. 54 year old aunt died. daughter 6 months pregnant first granddaughter. missed birth. really close aunt. healthy comorbidities. 

Why? Pfizer certainly good marketing.  No, happening. said doom statement thought spoof. stop talking public? Sweden good example lmao. doesn‚Äôt scale countries, different population layout, many points pandemic significantly worse neighbours. 

Additionally, Sweden far paternalistic culture somewhere like America, course self-imposed restrictions. also widespread distancing masking guidelines, conversation originally evidence lockdowns anything except delay cases/deaths pretty weak.

Incorrect. Besides, even delayed, delaying extent part whole health care system close overrun beginning, really certain areas.

This also objectively incorrect. fact was, what, concentrated urban areas makes literally quoted data. up. Dramatically, many studies confirm US.

And others, like Canadian one mentioned, suggest little understanding I'm saying. Based death rates, people died year expected - 300k more. 

I‚Äôm aware. data suggests would died rampant Covid spread, utilitarian point view lockdowns continue Sure. Deadly? even remotely close. factor like, 50x. 

I love pretended made argument didn‚Äôt, could tell I‚Äôm wrong. Nowhere comments say big diseases past 100-200 years, far least lethal.

It‚Äôs lethal flu common illnesses. want scale way back Spanish Flu Tuberculosis, yes it‚Äôs nowhere near. bad flu seasons, despite less deadly, caused serious problems, like H1N1. difference Covid unbelievably infectious, makes it‚Äôs low death rate hell lot problem. it‚Äôs hospitalization rate, even though want pretend isn‚Äôt case, severe enough mass infection would mean total breakdown healthcare sure without government lockdowns, would seen dramatic shift behavior simply due covid deadly elderly pre-existing conditions. 

What exactly suggests would case? People acted selfishly entire pandemic told everyone get bent. People barely stand six feet apart let alone mask limit look Sweden death tolls. Obviously population density same, certainly 500k jump 5M.

Economically, things bad recession April 2020 thanks stimulus cheques like population weathered storm well. fact, businesses trouble filling jobs right people don‚Äôt feel need them. Doesn‚Äôt sound like economic depression me.

Holy moly freaking clue TF talking about. spent TRILLIONS keep us afloat. That's trillions could spent next decade. think cost that? following anything economic indications regards inflation? labor supply shortage? think good thing? middle school something? realize businesses forced increase labor costs 50% one year raise prices significantly? incredibly conflicting evidence whether mental health broadly declined pandemic noticeable degree. studies show changing even getting better.

You clearly pulled ***. [there argument whether depression Go ask mental health professional busy 2020 2021 compared previous years. Everyone swamped. Man, 630K dead Covid US lockdowns mask mandates. would astronomically higher without. data suggest people died result lockdowns saved.

There 200-300k excess deaths even account covid. Lockdowns lack medical care due lockdowns played big role that. *more* people die lockdowns covid? No, clearly diminishing returns, lockdowns lead people dying (not covid). 

Again, increase violence, inflation/spending trap difficult long term. economy propped right trillions spending - spending yet really felt consequences of. Imagine spend trillions - instead spent trillions on, dunno, infrastructure? Paying debt? Green energy? homeless? spend, less spend future. 

And let's forget negative impact education children missing school entire year. 

You drastically underplaying result lockdowns. effects significant felt years come, many effects still felt. mean school starts?

X I'm beginning think CDC stupid incompetent. Anyone else? mean, knew beginning. think people shot no, mild side effects, booster shot less uphill battle.

I know someone afraid flu shot. finally got years ago gets every year realizing big deal. True, unfortunately demand nurses lot idiots working field. kind terrifying- know four people became nurses. One brilliant, one average, two really shockingly dumb. One really dumb ones thinks Europe country- 27. figure difference volume weight (I baked stuff her).

Unfortunately large fraction US population either never learned process new information learn it, refuse so.

He's *former* FDA official. holds office now. cause 358 pediatric deaths April 2009 September 2010, number covid-19 reaching almost year half in.

Not compelling since comparing scenario lockdown measures one lockdown measures. care kids? Immunocompromised people. fraction vaccinated population respond vaccination? care hospitals health care workers getting overwhelmed unvaccinated population? ready. CDC said think booster necessary yet shot recommendation. Seriously, touch news you? better. can‚Äôt speak guess point there‚Äôs lot don‚Äôt really know aside ‚ÄúCovid around while‚Äù. problem black brown communities? I'm vaccinated pissed fools vaccinated, getting sick, letting government use excuse reinstitute masks annoying restrictions.  

WTF matter people?  fucking lazy get shot?  fucking chicken face needle?  fucking stupid realize get shot get sick issue? OK news differences vaxxed unvaxxed? unvaxxed people likely infected COVID die COVID? vaccination prevent infections hospitalizations severe illness? prevents hospitalizations, point vaccinating young people anyway hospitalizations minuscule?  virus shouldnt allowed escape lab. Bullshit. wanted get everyone vaccinated, could make mandatory. classpass go variety gyms. One yoga studio makes wear lobby packed classes. One spin studio lets wear face shield instead easy enough push face completely ineffective. One spot gives fucks months. high intensity class don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever seen anyone wear mouth nose warm up. It‚Äôs theater. doubt Florida reaches many confirmed cases. First enough testing detect many cases. Second, experts UK predicting would peak 100,000 cases, however reached half like one week since seen massive drop infections. Hopefully trend see hotspots. Furthermore, seems like missouri arkansas may nearing peak. Florida much bigger filled tons tourist areas could fuel spread doubt 30,000 confirmed daily cases peak. Remember, winter wave peaked around 15,000 cases. booster would specific mutations rather individual variant, understand, mutations common several successful recent variants, point could assumed likely occur future strains. mutations result virus likely evade existing vaccine‚Äôs immune response, could worth targeting update Maybe people need learn use words better? Maybe ""facetime"" making inability communicate? Polio boosters routinely recommended. vaccinated once, longer decade traveling area polio infections still occurring take maximum one booster. smallpox talking years protection booster needed. I'm guessing vast majority people taken vaccine booster anytime past decade. [Here's answer comment would recommend deleting comments thread shared false information. else do? advertise TV? imagine part end commercial say side effects? i‚Äôm sure convince hesitant‚Ä¶ they're gonna ""Ouchie"" Florida! True, 80-90% people saw wearing masks metro, surprised see groups unmasked people. would see 1-2 people unmasked metro.  planned trip Disney Springs girlfriend month ago late birthday celebration, I'm really kind miffed sudden shift hit literally 3 days we're going.

I agree post I'm tired catering anti-vaxxers. Like wanna vax, yes, that's decision, ruin things rest us making everyone mask want different. origin important fact variants exist widespread elsewhere means opportunity enter U.S. see way go back normal vaccinated people still capable spreading disease. would need mask up, sanitize, socially distance COVID completely burns out. 

22% U.S. 18. 12-18 year olds could receive doses+2 week wait changed mask precaution guidance nationally May. I'll assume 2/3 age group 12, leaves 14% nation still ineligible receive vaccines. 

With 14% country (ie. elementary preschools) vulnerable COVID Delta variant spreadable throughout vaccinated community, way go back normal. Parents office would still need mask risk bringing Delta home children. could try avoid travel restrictions Delta countries, already saw racist tactic fail last spring restricted international travel. could remote elementary classes, also return normalcy. 

I would say accept risk like flu. Even flu kills young people shuts schools every year, small numbers. problem COVID Delta putting higher normal number children hospital. COVID might weaken time, yet. 

I think agree unvaccinated people fault variants. disagree voluntarily unvaccinated solely responsible. think real way empathy still vulnerable keep precautions dangerous variants died out. Yes, want get airplane, go work, go school, send kids school, myriad things require covid tests people attending.

Then got contact tracing someone tests positive usually finds many more. Desantis sizzle steak. He‚Äôs culture warrior, side culture war firmly anti-vaccine. can‚Äôt go No. Vermont sane. Missouri insane. sure hell quarantine themselves. They'll hitting bars, restaurants, shops Florida beyond! partial answer NYT Also, ages people vaccinated vary significantly different time periods studied. example, ***the people got vaccines January different got April one major respect: 60.*** people got vaccinated January getting infected, may vaccine itself, advanced age ‚Äî factor researchers yet take consideration.   vaccine indeed waning six months, implications enormous.  
can influence Israeli government‚Äôs current deliberations whether give people third shot. Dr. Segal says vaccines indeed losing potency, might wise roll boosters fight Delta-driven outbreak. CDC outsource marketing MLM. fed take back money GOP, pro Covid, anti - anything protects Covid...masks, vaccine, experts diseases... wish could post GIF standing ovation you, sir!! late may worried small surge Alpha. already knew vaccines would destroy Alpha, yet vaccinated enough avoid surge (and indeed many places small surge vaccinations took since nearly eliminated Alpha).

But logic also elderly vaccinated deaths among young could ignored. is, basically, true: people 30-60 risk, risk several fold higher Delta. much-pushed logic deaths follow cases entirely false. We've dropped CFR 1.5% 1%, maybe IFR dropped even testing less, cases rise 10-fold, deaths also.

No doubt public health people freaking regional healthcare collapse weekly doubling certain areas, combined nightmare trying reopen schools high delta prevalence facing hundreds deaths schoolchildren since let get vaccinated. teacher teaches 780 kids. might well start weekly testing  Thanks. infect people? Saying 100% worth getting.  4100 deaths 20,000+ adverse reactions disapprove message. Yep. also made law unless declares e.o. schools aren‚Äôt allowed issue mask mandates either. took bait. face evidence, facts, word non-partisan civil servants (such Fauci), chose deny, deny, deny dose common sense. certain somebody told fire hoax guy's house went up, would call fire department? mean deep delusion go? 18 still posts don‚Äôt understand virus spreads, even putting high risk situations. two paid days get vaccine? got away hundreds killed Texas winter storm. Texans deaths phase him. Woohoo covid rollercoaster. irony virus still hosted vaccinated body.. covid really causes infertility we‚Äôre fucked lol. everytime log FFXIV telling ""I'm making difference!"" friend nurse Florida. told today almost end rope. Every day shift, makes conscious decision go work. Shit's getting bad there. I'm freaking wear mask, fact really dont mind wearing one, I'm hoping theres going lockdowns, although dont forsee realistically happening, seems like possibility. so, lockdown would giant middle finger right thing got shot. It‚Äôs long since forgotten preventing hospitalization deaths necessarily cases. People see rising cases freak fuck don‚Äôt even look deaths. article posted TODAY CNN states:
""The CDC tracked serious infections requiring hospitalization deaths among fully vaccinated people. publishing data timely manner, stopped national tracking mild asymptomatic infections"" worries. stopped asking ago. 

Take care.  Yep, did. He's disgrace disappointment. many Missourians risk failure leadership!  really sucks get vax, still get virus. together may worse one. think bad wait till start seeing repercussions climate change. ever go away? point uptake valid! justify sharing verifiably false information though. absolutely concretely firm? severe include people lifelong damage heart lungs, blood clots etc.? curious many vaccinated people symptoms health issues months getting corona. mass vaccinations key. Remember folks, vaccinations **collective/populational** measures. single vaccinated person sea infected people surely get bad. single infected people sea vax likely infect almost no-one. vaccines mandated.  Imagine required injected thing that‚Äôs around less year, officially FDA approved, made partially stem cells aborted babies.

Why hell would even trust it‚Äôs safe people telling it‚Äôs safe people power, people want take advantage. thanks, I‚Äôll keep wearing mask. wish sub would stop sharing Israeli media garbage. study used subjects vaccinated AstraZenica, already knew wasn‚Äôt top shelf Delta. Abject stupidity undoing civilization. Nothing article speculating wild possibilities make less true. one ever said anything impossible, likely. virus still error correcting mechanism. may evade vaccines may not. Well good least accepted that. still know people expect us zero Covid. Never going happen. Keep protect family that's do.  say don‚Äôt give shit people move on.  booster 3rd dose, dunno choose. Brazil also said vaccinate teenagers adult vaccination ends, likely around end august.  might. don‚Äôt enough instances happening know. definitely won‚Äôt hurt, though. government mislead us many times. It‚Äôs like boy cried wolf. turn back pages history see there‚Äôs much government mistrust they‚Äôve used people experiments past. send kids back school safely. school hybrid model, elementary students campus, cases people catching Covid outside school, spread within school. 

Here's did:

Daily health screenings everyone, one symptoms allowed campus cleared negative COVID test

Masks required everyone.

Handwashing every transition.

No visitors field trips.

Classes pods mix classes. meant lunch classroom (eating time = talking facing forward, we'd put videos read story, mask back soon finish eating) Classes could often eat outside, weather permitting.

Quarantine pod positive case.

HEPA air filter machines every classroom.

New better filters HVAC system.

Mandatory testing faculty staff holidays. Random testing that.

We minimal cases families mostly taking seriously, catch outside school spread within school. done safely, people follow science. every school afford HVAC overhaul HEPA filter machines, everyone wear masks wash hands, creativity flexibility create pods class mixing minimized possible spread limited. hardest part families keeping kids home they're sick, someone home sick, families anyone watch kids, schools going strict avoid becoming petri dishes. back masking guess provide link? I'm seeing anything rhinovirus overwhelming New Zealand hospitals. seems like common sense, big revelation Damn.  ‚Ä¶while profiting like hell spreading vaccine misinformation. central database storage records aside paper card? guess mean ‚Äúnever end‚Äù ‚Äúending‚Äù like flu. think Covid always around, I‚Äôm tired - tired - mask talk, shut talk, anti-vaxxer bullshit. want drama end honestly really nice article lots different data points. parts country are:

Like parts Missouri: 
   
 
Some COVID-19 patients turned away overwhelmed hospital southwestern Missouri amid surge cases, taken less-stressed hospitals hundreds miles away Kansas City St. Louis. 
 
And Florida: 
  
 
Health First limiting elective surgical procedures four Brevard County hospitals, effective Thursday continuing Aug. 15, reaction surge COVID-19 patients. 
 
Health First spokesman Lance Skelly said hospital company ""will postponing scheduled, non-emergent surgeries procedures require hospital bed."" Well, since PPP mostly graft rich people, surprising all.

The mask stuff nothing Federal handouts.

I HB year. definitely avoid place. lucky. die RSV. Preemies especially risk, preemies make 10% births worldwide. course, preemies also greater risk COVID-19. three kids preemies 26 weeks pregnant fourth. It‚Äôs terrifying time. Source: Agreed. I‚Äôm vaxxed put mask back to. I‚Äôm gonna really really upset indoor dining goes away limited capacity stores comes back. CDC unilaterally making case letting scientists ones charge, making case STEM focused education liberal arts approach. total lack reasonable consideration human nature pretty astounding, attempt (badly) anticipate people want hear drive behavior. It‚Äôs pretty much common sense everywhere vaccinated people still need wear masks practice social distancing high proportion (60% over) people fully vaccinated.

I honestly don‚Äôt know CDC came this. Vaccinations collective measures, individual. many children vaccinations mandated. Americans trouble understanding anything outside individual risk perception. permanently, covid No. won‚Äôt that. I‚Äôm done shit.

Every time see outbreak, it‚Äôs always unvaccinated. I‚Äôve warn masks. I‚Äôve sanitized. I‚Äôve done everything right got shots ASAP. I‚Äôm done protecting idiots. 

Yes, know, mutating strains. Doesn‚Äôt matter unvaccinated get it. get general. 

Thanks. would be?  live rest life like 2020 fucking end &amp;&amp; booster ineffective? Omg love mega corporations now!  I'm introvert restrictions fucked anyway. Strong difference passive deciding imposed. Anyway, gladly second shot days ago I'll less worry, still nothing, better last year think  symptoms ""asymptomatic"". Pardon anthropomorphism, Delta evil genius. Facebook Instagram whatsapp

all Facebook, enabled trump worked Americans getting vaccinated. 

boycott all.  It‚Äôs kind selfish thinking continues episode. may get sick/have symptoms spread hurt people otherwise wouldn‚Äôt gotten sick careful caring. Wear damn mask called ‚Äúthe Facebook‚Äù couldn‚Äôt much. used dating poking people don‚Äôt see terrifying is, I‚Äôm going change mind Reddit comment. please think more. Consider different flying internationally going college. gotten tested since then? live masks. Nothing else though. probably go special events bars wear mask there. Nope, that's important everyone keep mind. masking unvaccinated, masking keep hospitals overflowing people medical emergencies (which could you, kid, spouse, parent, etc.) still get quality care. Oh good them. everyone working class luxury working home. J&amp;J Pfizer booster ‚Ä¶ still wear mask big crowds outside prevent transmission others ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs semi whimsical honest. I‚Äôm purely anecdotal don‚Äôt go kind toxic moron downvotes honest question like this? Seriously, people: get fucking grip. Something dont understand...in late may everyone freaking mask policy dropped people said cases would rise generally understood freak since deaths rise much it. 

Now like logic went completely window back freaking cases everybody knew going go back point (either variant winter due seasonality), fucking gives? never said pandemic forever. said endemic now. Saying endemic yet semantics. I‚Äôll get booster  never taken off. Kids can‚Äôt get vaccinated off. doesn‚Äôt make sense. can‚Äôt TRUST Americans make rules make firm Hide inside forever then, covid never eradicated. Definitely good news HCW, often bombarded exposure. factor study needs considered, that's say rest vaccinated population definitely immune either. Thank Asymptomatic means virus technically arent sick noticeable way. still might spread others, arent sick it.

Not infected means dont even virus all. halted vaccines never given chance run course. Eventually people would either die develop natural resistance immunity. It‚Äôs cycle that‚Äôs feature life aeons. transition pandemic endemic inevitable surprise. Also, many viral infections ‚Äúlong hauler symptoms‚Äù (but called that), lasting months. seen patients viral pneumonia similar lingering problem year. mononucleosis Dengue. usually get diagnosed Chronic Fatigue Fibromyalgia arthritis, get detailed history, many began soon infection.

Yeah nice protected rate 90%.

2.1 100,000 required hospitalization.

60 confirmed cases air travel 2020 1.2 billion flights. Higher risk office building clear context implied question vaccination rate hospitalized. Yeah, generally felt/feel exact way. 

I ok idea governor - veteran, former representative, seemed like halfway-decent person (for politician). 

Since pandemic began, hatred continued grow. 

As Floridian, I'm used negatively apathetic governors, guy really sucks.

Thanks linking think everyone PTSD last year. We're terrified beginning end, know? Sure, recommendation... turn mandate? mandate turn limited gatherings? limited gatherings turn lockdowns? I'm terrified favorite things taken again. lockdowns caused significant harm, mentally financially. I'm young risk small. fact, risk is, like, 0.00000001% right I'm vaccinated. can't keep living like this. He's definitely gunning presidency 2024 Trump run. Sur Wendy‚Äôs TLDR: since data still early incomplete, better safe sorry. vaccine coming available things weeks? get car accident shot? Vaccine mandates literally around legal since founding nation. good flow see infections means mutations, stupid.  yea next pandemic people hold $$$ Honestly, I'm basically point. longer care adult dies COVID chose get vaccinated, *especially* spread anti-vaxxer propaganda. 40+% population never get vaccinated, I'm sure there's mechanism ever stop pandemic. I'm tired life dictated people stupid get free safe solution. Hospitalizations rising quickly too, means deaths will. It‚Äôs bad rise cases (as would expect mass vaccination) see strain healthcare infrastructure certain areas. make 6 figures, make 7 figures.

Anti-vaxxers everywhere. tech company them. Read blind believe me. health system live publishing numbers daily last week 89% covid hospitalizations unvaccinated vaccinated patients ICU. Hospitalization numbers approaching last July‚Äôs peak   stupid tale.  Surely better options systemically murdering millions people. Also ""hanged"", unless meant antivaxxers somehow well-endowed. live Indonesia, current drop may statistical glitch based reduced testing last week. signs spread least plateaued though. free part fluke, standard procedure vaccines anything healthcare related. part problem countries even getting orders filled first place. Tell polio, measles, smallpox. never ever getting Covid Virus Pandemic we? üò¢ NEED FREAKING CURE SIDE EFFECTS EVER FREAKING WISH! LORD MERCY FREAKING SUCKS MUCH NIGHTMARE EVER GOING END? VIRUS EVER GOING CONTAINED?! üôèüò≠ Money? scare article? Technically every virus always couple mutations - even one mutation - away rendering vaccines ineffective? true, kind long term impact profit, no? Guess there's answer. Maybe people wear masks without whining it. intially. Initially affected poor - people work home work, people lived crowded housing isolate etc, affect POC white people. since vaccine? Yeah, can't really say more, since republicans ones likely unvaccinated. mean isnt always case technically? We're already seeing delta. Original strain moderna/pfizer 95% effective symptomatic disease 100% effective severe disease.

Now we're 88%/96% delta.

You mutate another strain could see 80/90.

And 70/80. 

And eventually doesnt work all. long cant totally stamp out, becoming difficult sheer...ignorance country insofar innoculations go, gonna keep mutating becoming harder eradicate. half population actually part gets vaccines gets hard work undone half shrugs idea long covid old people dying side effect impacts 0.0002% people take it. 

Its frustrating, stupid, get freaking shot, people. confirmation kids ventilators? confirmation kids qualify ventilators suffering sufficient level disease? 

  Among children need critical care, ‚Äúsome required ventilator support,‚Äù Versalovic told Houston Press.

How it? school district TX sent email saying state cut funding virtual learning, longer even offered. people monsters wondering recent BS coming thanks link Yep. vaxxed j&amp;j NY spending winter back home. I'm back made appt pfizer. Got problem. asked confirm birthday. *What* relief! can't wait tell fully-vaccinated-for-months-now sister... currently sick hell Covid right now.

**How ""Effective!""**
**?** point dictatorships 'I'm never buying Apple product again! next year new one comes out..."" worried about? 1% chance dying Covid? number cited 72.4%, 60%. said, splitting hairs. person may exaggerated bit, simple fact wide majority people worldwide received vaccine COVID-19. even vaccinated yet ... Still waiting think messaging problems CDC (and probably rest government).

When make decision include reasoning soundbyte. Something like ""Because low transmissibility covid high rate vaccination, wear masks youre vaccinated"". message delivered effectively 'its done'. way ground work situation changes. hard all. Doesn‚Äôt matter independent contractors. company require it.  Alberta government stupid. Kenney sucks! majority non-vaccinated VAX-hestitant due health reasons, FDA approval, etc.

Anecdotal uncle anti-covidvax, get vaccine weekend saw data vaccinated hospitalized feels somewhat comfortable getting many people gotten vaccine without issues.  Fucking great. Lol fk Yup. shrug. Nice chat like minded person. Cheers safe travels.  Finally! vaccine going fully approved &amp; authorized emergency use? Agreed. Frankly, want paper trail get it. already see insurance companies calling positive covid diagnosis preexisting condition 2040. feel sick I'll isolate longer feel sick move on. So... uh... exactly end goal here?? never get sick again??? goal make hospitalizations manageable? I'm seeing LOT ""well I'm vaccinated still got sick"". Y'all... never going eradicate disease. vaccinated, safe. fine. need protect anti-vaxers? I'm like close totally throwing towel. 2020 worst year life. much look forward winter, and, point, terrified going taken away again. can't deal again. can't. want live perpetual hell rest life. think can‚Äôt get worse less people listen health Secretaries, Fauci, cdc, etc better be.

Then please enlighten us, listen advice? missing fact large portion Reddit doesn‚Äôt understand out-of-pocket max is. believe around 8k. admit I'm favor mandating vaccines residents government. Mandating vaccines employees services require in-person presence provided makes sense many cases (though could list exceptions here, also). person avoid e.g. requiring school services, requiring in-person employment, make curbside pickup groceries, on, think need vaccinated. 

I can't accept claim due process helps criminals get away plot crimes. believe lack due process would increase crimes (due abuse system, criminal), decrease crimes. believe would also increase general severity crimes.  Yes, did. least area south, got green zone cases. Vaccinated people taking masks beginning go restaurants stores. spiked really quickly, week so, back danger red zone. live liberal part US (DC) entered substantial spread category. I‚Äôm afraid mask mandate instead recommendation‚Ä¶

I totally fine others wearing mask, would also like wear one situations think would make sense, please, mandates... Since March 2020 living restrictions, mandates vaccines till December. aware still pandemic, DC high vaccination rates low hospitalization rates. someone another country, I‚Äôve always seen US different places: country nobody forces pressures something, people don‚Äôt care others think them/nobody cares first place, anywhere else.

DC bigger cities may probably never leave substantial spread next summer, Covid going anywhere, yet afraid effects mask mandate making everyone seem uniform masks, people judge/mask shame other, realize effective vaccines protecting them. image masked population mandate like repeat 2020, vaccinated population, even depressing. Whether agree not, people‚Äôs behaviors affected businesses continue suffer.

I 100% everyone masking personally want recommendation, tired mandates end sight. people probably say I‚Äôm stupid anti-masker, go ahead, people able make decisions year half. Limiting freedoms end sight ‚Äúthe freest country Earth‚Äù, opinion, worrying. Sorry long rant‚Ä¶ matters weekly rolling avg, went again. Exactly one week ago 43k cases. took look hospitalization deaths chart state (which super high vaccination percentage). real deviations either since past 2 months really. Deaths usually lag behind real increase hospitalizations US supposedly several weeks wave already, see confirming points talking here. virus never end period. It‚Äôll become big deal case increases become negligible. particular surge however definitely end. others have. goal mask cautious getting shots arms like said. Every time see outbreak always unvaccinated? 
Haven't heard Provincetown cluster then? 833 cases now, majority vaccinated. that's 0.57% medical workers who, vaccinated, caught COVID symptoms six weeks later? original comment nothing later functions requirements. wouldn‚Äôt starting best best. fully vaccinated months amd ima go back wearing mask everywhere lol someone immune deficiency another underlying condition true. Back whole pandemic started often got sick exposure sick people: that‚Äôs risk take living life, choose take it. Would great people didn‚Äôt show sick places like work school? Definitely. also can‚Äôt control actions other, everyone else. Soon Desantis realize dictator can't force places ignore covid. west coast. east coast. angel pretending be

Period. guess find unlikely vaccinated people usually hang vaccinated people know exposed. stuffy nose, probably won‚Äôt get tested. anyone around never know indeed covid. Man, realize they're trying preserve money whatever, benefits going people yet vaccinated really feels like reward held out. Issuing benefits like everyone vaccinated making ""welcome bundle"" situation people get second shot seems equitable gives little extra encouragement people get shot continue hold out, incentive enough change mind. like California, people $50,000 getting vaccine, early people access $50,000. call cattle land called house land human beings. Pulling house listings Zillow right now... Oh damn... Singapore doing. We‚Äôre still midst vaccination drive extended everyone 12 years old above. We‚Äôre still facing resistance oldest demographic population, 70 years over. speedy spread Delta variant pretty frightening. However, stats support position mass vaccination way go keep people seriously ill critical care needing oxygen. say infection impossible vaccinated, comment make sense. Man lot family that‚Äôs hit this, followed many people turned right vs left debate. Lots private schools churing monsters. I'm small oklahoma town one christian school turned least 1 guy killed parents last decade. personally know others seriously fucked adults barely function socity.  real. live South able function last couple weeks. much debate. data varies wildly. forecasts always useless - nobody really predict peak it‚Äôs shown again. Even think need vaccine, get protect people around you? I'm fully vaccinated even though really think *I personally* needed it, realized getting it, I'm helping prevent people getting COVID. 1yr-old daughter got COVID today despite us following CDC guidelines. Show compassion can‚Äôt get vaccinated. physician running study stated Pfizer measured antibody production patients prior opening study. empiric data showed increase 7-10x.

I can't quantify exactly much worse me, rough. trouble immunizing patients day after. Whatever takes. people. people. I'm guy, fuck kids.

/s sure cyclical part wasnt point. meant takes political guts confident policy despite focus delta variant. Folks predicted massive rise soon reopened, didnt happen Good luck. got deleted last week something similar completely innocuous. That's fine, ""breakthroughs"" whatever vaccine completely different Americans also approved FDA even FDA-EUA evidence need 2 years ago antivaxxers pretty much universally derided cranks conspiracy theorists, vanishingly small proportion population routinely mocked. 40% US population basically antivax. government public health experts clearly failed responsibility they've managed make things much worse short period time. CDC specifically also whole media-political complex, sides GOP. anything, makes easier. 

But Uber Lyft already hard time finding enough drivers is, doubt really want require it. Man chooses, slave obeys.  

The way true freedom obedience. deliberation brave action right, comfortable.  

Please grow pair resist actually get past tyranny get back normal. question vaccine efficacy measured? virus immune system kills it, means infected right, regardless symptoms?

So need virus vaccines effects work, anyone get infected due vaccine? meant ""did factor delta variant""? Since delta variant dominant strain, research conducted nowadays automatically account it. think I'm missing something. new research? Yeah actually unsubbed spending couple days seeing nothing endless comments complaining wearing masks. already saw right last year worth time arguing over. thought sub would different. looking informed honest discussion delta variant everyone complaining pandemic yet criticizing CDC. reading epsilon variant evades antibodies.  family glitch. family spouse's employer offers affordable coverage employee family coverage like $6000 month, qualify subsidy exchange even would qualified really cheap coverage based income. 

A lot people Florida working couple part time jobs benefits would qualify exchange they're married spouse affordable plan, lose subsidy family. 

My husband insurance years family glitch. earned $4000 per month family coverage work $3000 per month work offer insurance. But, coverage 9% earnings, 'affordable' plan even way get insurance.  great news helping restore faith FL. Texas  waiting same. 1yr-old tested positive COVID today. Wife vaxxed, still wear masks go out, mother-in-law refused vaccine. daycare (we decided less risky regular daycare), gave daughter COVID. people dumb af they'd get vaccinated stop spreading it, letting mutate further. whole feeling guilty again. doses expire get tossed anyway.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Seems like tech companies leading way office closures like first round last year.  Context matters.

So words. could clear

That's I'm asking for. mean question like ""hey go pick food deliver house.""

Sure. ask I'm guessing one pick actual intent.

I never express negative assumptions anyone, especially someone asking help. make even one negative assumption asked vaccinations unvaccinated. pointed go that.

I try isolate ""you're one few.""

I seen questions months. quite ofte people simply know vaccination rate quite often ask find it. Surprised get downvoted telling truth. mean vaccinated people spread vaccinated people? Thanks! ""Baron von Ripper-off"" terrible.Future host cities careful.Yesterday European media found partying Olympic Village locals...Why people cannot behave? mmm..

Thanks wishing good luck,I hope nothing found.or found,hoping caught early. I‚Äôll get booster Alternate headline: 93% Healthcare workers catch covid thanks vaccine.  Nope. illegal. employed At-Will. option finding work elsewhere want follow rules take vaccine. understand Florida governor terrible leader played huge overall role crisis. 

I also understand Disney, Universal, etc, responsibility, and, certain extent, ‚Äúedge‚Äù, given are, comes implementing enforcing safety measures parks. 

I also understand regular family 4, trips like this, especially include airfare, cheap require long time plan. 

But love god, going voluntarily put hell Florida *August*, damn sure get vaccine. due respect, that. Ill mask - problem there, going self-isolate asymptomatically protect vaccine hesitant. stay home time? Bet would extra cash pocket. employed At-Will. option finding work elsewhere want follow rules take vaccine. hope bring me. Yeah chance June looking really good. it‚Äôs going get bad. Doubt it. brand image way $$$, Disney World closed desantis trying get open tourists would come spend money FL. Even FL ‚Äúreopened‚Äù Disney one last ones open. Third dose 7-10x response second dose.

Sorry, clarify this, mean experienced 7-10x immune response 7-10x perceived negative side side effects? 

Also, /u/eju2000: thank contributing scientific advancement benefits humanity see/hear relied part this? people probably couldn‚Äôt even point India map. shutting again. Good, suffering deserved hope drown it. Like Intel/amd windows/Mac? wonder would like healthcare workers constantly coming contact COVID do? point people sure til next set data comes they‚Äôre looking like jerks downvoting harassing people brought concerns it. 

Sorry didn‚Äôt get it. It‚Äôs 18 months, haven‚Äôt recognized case numbers cyclical yet? think cases going 2 months now. I'd prefer play Russian roulette gun 300 chambers. Nothing stopping you. Bring people believe can't trust data based fewer 1000 sample size. Smh I'll read first two words title go sleep happily Wait, talking booster study original vaccine study? without keeping thousands people unvaccinated

It sounds like talking original vaccine here..? Odds pretty damn sick pretty damn low. blame Yeah, partner PhD biologist looking science communication job. worked CDC DOE government definitely pushed path haha. call ""empty land"" current Mosaic mines, old Mosaic mines, Cattle Land, Nature Preserves cities built top them. One example Babcock Ranch advertised solar powered town reality FPL built solar farm town connected right grid.. powered solar directly, built top freakin' preserve.. fuck animals living they're.

You may live Florida need lot research dark side state.  think there‚Äôs much variation anecdotally. sons covid April, father one shot acquired covid waiting period infected 13 &amp;11yos. literally sick two days (13 year old sick 11 still two days headache. running track meets 10 days post positive test.) 11 year old always gets viruses affecting GI tract, threw twice headache fine day. Even ex husband shocking( usually gets hard bronchitis every winter) sick week work ten days(he‚Äôs late 30s. wonder affects badly virus hits person since they‚Äôve said along it‚Äôs almost always mild children. ) 
My uncles friend fully vaccinated passed away covid June. (I don‚Äôt mind sharing name since battle public online, believe comorbidities bc didn‚Äôt understand went hospital seemed okay talking online ton took him. wonder health issues say prevent death know vaccine 100% still scares me. Yeah referencing extra couple % Moderna pfizer. Like 1-2 w.e categories started hating Florida cause desantis parent toddler infant ware mask even grafted face REALLY want see age break none articles ever give information. even think people know fuck they're talking anymore. getting vaccinated said, apparently vaccine 80% effective Delta 2. sudden no? BS Timing everything. actually read posted? Scalability important part equation here. Whatever engineered support users. Yes, 2004 might able copy functionality version Facebook in, week two. good luck serving 1 million users. significantly harder back then.  kids need hospital can‚Äôt get admitted it‚Äôs capacity, record amount children covid. It‚Äôs pediatric hospital Arkansas. Sorry, can't predict that. many variables. unvaccinated people quickly come senses get vaccinated, lot quicker, far fewer deaths. remain stubborn ... take awhile. Depends infection rate variant social behavior. Exactly! companies like Hobby Lobby Chik-Fil-A mandate none employees LGBTQ, since also affects employees around since founding nation. 

I can‚Äôt wait see healthcare decisions Amazon mandates onto lucky employees! FLATTEN CURVE  indication Olympics contributing noticeably spread Covid?

I've posted ([e.g. - case cancelling Olympics Covid never made sense kind reasonable cost-benefit grounds. Pediatricians agree it‚Äôs dangerous, contagious   
They recommend masks schools, think wise know really serious, I'm angry anti-vaxxers disappointed CDC that, can't help point tiny spelling error made laugh CDC wanted everyone uses pubic transport one vaccine that's not-for-profit one dumped  
  
In Germany deliberate - false leak health ministry picked propagated *The Handelsblatt* - business newspaper. Someone call TVA seems OK far, mild fever. Thankfully kids pretty resistant, feels like everything last year half protect wasted. disheartening see sure...

I know staying positive good mental health, man, remember looked Israel model good news said data figured out?

We can't sudden discredit group negative data they're pulling. need learn source information country using vaccine types US get ahead curve.

What sucks feel Israel vaccinated many people overall compared US they're still expecting surges cases, hospitalizations deaths. Guess shipped J&amp;J shots Brazil instead hoping knuckleheads would take People want think critically. I'm glad two went public information; people watching good someone trying bribe ""celebrities"". gives media incentive track sold pressure retracting misinformation.

I think one rare cases public shaming works. cactus Yea seeing ton it. One dedicated peds nurses said got it. Singapore reported performance results pfizer. 44% efficacy real world. 


Israel went first offered update world performance pfizer. see similar things happening worldwide couple months. Covid wants replicate. sci-fi bad guys called Replicators? one Star Gates? boss's mom died Florida. Apparently like 7 people family got it. None vaccinated. mean imagine heat, getting fever top it? Coronavirus bad worse pushed media.

No, early serious concern going overwhelm health system. large not. 

Anger conspiracy thinking sells. fear. definitely market freaking people way reasonable, market severely underplaying it. knowingly go spreading virus causing breakthrough infections, risk children getting health issues, potentially driver mutations, perpetuating cycle? may asymptomatic, plenty vaccinated people losing weeks life breakthroughs. Surely people see selfish would be. service good man! Ivermectin? seems reason (drug companies can‚Äôt make enough money, patent ran out) one wants use it, site poorly conducts studies yet administered works isn‚Äôt dangerous. 

There several countries used namely India, able lower cases using vaccines drug.

 simple explanation information there. honestly way far pandemic acting like understand mean, here's link refresher: Fair. That's one nicest things heard while. Thank you. business owner Florida, give shit DeSantis says. I'd require whatever hell want. dipshit customer said can't 'cause HIPAA, whatever bullshit reason antivaxxers say, I'd tell them, ""so sue me"" show door. Agreed. ‚Äúfreedom isn‚Äôt free‚Äù tough guys? Micky wear mask inside outside costume? Yeah, hand they‚Äôre forcing workforce back on-site, let‚Äôs start sucking Apples yet‚Ä¶. actually live world ""have listening MyPillow guy"" probably means something even people outside US little sympathy folks vast ignorance, don‚Äôt forget thing therapeutic vaccine. Thanks finding that.  Hill document. 

1) document Hill links to?

That directly ongoing preprint study linked Hill.

No... see linked document.

I see 83.7 84 anywhere document claim link to.

Maybe missed it?

2) Let's assume ..""it's there."" Somewhere. good data engineering. two reports, up-to-date early July source, Yale Medical. 

One (allegedly) says vaccine efficacy dropped 83.x% 6 months says vaccines probably good ""up year.""

In particular says: "" ‚ÄúIn addition circulating antibodies, memory B cells cells respond quickly control infection. could many years, unless variants able evade kind immunity.‚Äù ""

So reconcile this? good year? dropping effectiveness long that.

Which true? true? coronavirus variant discovered Colombia showing among patients South Florida, increasing infections putting health officials alert calls grow louder unvaccinated individuals get inoculated.

Carlos Migoya, CEO Jackson Health System, told WPLG Miami earlier week B.1.621 variant accounted 10 percent coronavirus patients, trailing behind delta, now-dominant variant United States ravaging nation‚Äôs unvaccinated, gamma variant. B.1.621 yet receive Greek-letter designation prominent variants have.

Migoya told news station speculated B.1.621 rising South Florida international travel Colombia Miami, serves gateway Latin America.

A person replied email sent Washington Post Migoya‚Äôs office said unavailable comment.

Health experts keep B.1.621 radar fall season looms parts country still lag vaccination efforts, experts told Post.

The earliest documented samples B.1.621 noted January, least 16 cases recently reported United Kingdom, health officials noted majority cases linked variant result international travel.

Public Health England noted last week currently evidence indicate variant causes severe disease evades efficacy vaccines. Yet agency designated variant investigation continues conduct lab testing better understand impact mutations coronavirus.

The European Center Disease Control Prevention also chosen assign variant one interest, evidence could suggest significant impact. designation also notes much data preliminary marked many questions.

In United States, variant yet named variant interest concern, accounting 2.1 percent cases July 17, noted John Sellick, professor Jacobs School Medicine Biomedical Sciences University Buffalo.

‚ÄúThe time becomes important gives virus selective advantage, we‚Äôve seen delta variant,‚Äù said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll see one. ‚Ä¶ see two weeks now, four weeks now, going another trick wind more?‚Äù

Story continues advertisement

Sellick noted quickly delta variant went accounting 10 percent cases beginning June 80 percent cases mid-July.

The Centers Disease Control Prevention monitoring 10 variants addition B.1.621, variant popping South Florida.

Only time provide information B.1.621, Sellick said.

‚ÄúIf thing really transmissible goes 2 percent [of infections] 30 percent 60 percent; don‚Äôt want see that,‚Äù said. ‚ÄúIt fit delta variant. would transmissible.‚Äù

It doesn‚Äôt take much time variants spread, especially among unvaccinated people, said Preeti N. Malani, chief health officer professor medicine Division Infectious Diseases University Michigan.

Malani pointed drug company Biogen‚Äôs annual leadership conference February 2020, coronavirus spread across Massachusetts country, example quickly variants spread.

‚ÄúIf lot unvaccinated people gathering they‚Äôre going back home, could rapid transmission weeks,‚Äù said.

Concerns variants really set contagious elude vaccine, said.

Many worries variants infections mitigated people choosing get vaccinated, effort become like ‚Äúwhack-a-mole‚Äù initiative new variants emerge fears vaccination hinder progress, Malani said.

‚ÄúThis concept risk interesting. understand take risks lot things,‚Äù said, mentioning car travel late-night dog walks examples. ‚ÄúWith coronavirus, risk seems high others it‚Äôs not. [The risk is] somewhere middle. risk vaccination really rare. move forward, risk going go zero anytime soon.‚Äù

As delta variant continues wreak havoc across country, along coronavirus variants making debut new infections, might time reconsider travel social plans even one vaccinated, experts say.

‚ÄúThis novel coronavirus. We‚Äôre still learning it,‚Äù Malani said. ‚ÄúEach variants bring new challenges.‚Äù

:) No, it‚Äôs not. You‚Äôre living false reality Reddit cesspool. 

Vaccinated also spreading virus per CDC.. 

(theguardian.com/world/2021/jul/28/cdc-director-new-mask-guidance-vaccinated-spreading-delta-variant)  saw one statement hospital Alabama said pediatric cases ICU primarily older children, mostly 10 up. 

As fellow parent feels terrible. one anecdotal article read moment time last week. Bruh vaccinated people continue taking L L unvaxxed people? Stop trying guilt trip us start fining unvaxxed morons. 

Im sorry children cant get vaccinated life too. idea hospitalizations deaths percentage cases far-fetched worth spending time dispute. Every time there's rise cases, next month narrative ""but hospitalizations deaths still flat!"". physically impossible every disease causes outcomes. always percentage number infected. two ways reduce deaths: reducing number infected, reducing IFR. We've done second dropped deaths 200/day (maybe even lower deaths old infections), cases double redouble deaths always follow. agree people reap sow, revelling deaths monsters. Ugh, sucks. It‚Äôs possible daughter given us. We‚Äôre getting tested tomorrow.

The relationship MIL probably damaged beyond repair point. It‚Äôs sad people took ignorance far. keeps getting better better. Thank ending anxiety attack I‚Äôve moderate symptoms. mild, severe. I‚Äôm past worst (day 7) really uncomfortable. Feels like bad hangover little chest pain. Never much cough fever. Headaches persistent. GI issues. Lost taste smell (and appetite along it). think I‚Äôve worse case friends caught unvaxxed earlier pandemic. Please kind yourself. Everyone stressing right now.  going make difference recirculated aircon airtight ship. Maybe. Suicidal thoughts creeping again. surprised? Vaccines shield getting covid. lower chances getting symptoms severe illness covid. fully vaccinated still ""get"" covid test positive. illness likely mild symptoms. people understanding this? isn‚Äôt lambda. ANOTHER variant. Ugh. That‚Äôs fair, I‚Äôm clearly little edge nowadays couldn‚Äôt tell üòÖ country curiously? Good luck! Okay. I'll tell aunt stay home house gets foreclosed becomes homeless. Okay. Wheres Raditz need him? exact boat right now. NYS contact tracing said could test positive believe 90 days virus. sent paperwork stating case anywhere demanding negative test future, includes date positive test. falsify free vaccination... 75% vs 10% good lord, may whoever's mercy us Let's cut chase ask question: 

Are mayors (who Democrats, strikes non-coincidental) ""science"", potential political gain defying DeSantis, prospective 2024 Presidential candidate?

I inclined say latter. 

It's mostly political theatre nonsense anymore. Yeah, really substantial amount anti-vaxxers. much new variants change equation? don‚Äôt understand grandparents thoughtless towards grand children! Suffice say, everyone gets family, relationship mother-in-law going much different. least they're better states gold standard contact tracing system lockdown one case. Oh wait, except they're lockdown going back normal. bring poverty. homeless virtually unaffected covid. risk. Explain that. Also explain CDC guidance closing border thousands unvaccinated unmasked illegally spew daily? Maybe keep kids safe possible put homeless illegals crossing border? Hmm? Whatcha think? virus attack whole population once, numbers useless. need compare total number infected, group vaccinated unvaccinated. imo always less incentives duty country. past faced challenges, people found pride protected fellow countrymen part achieve national goal bear national burden. Nobody told step like should. They've told hold act like they're business transaction waiting personal benefits perks, make sense public health national security. prob go r/covid19 informed discussions unvaccinated need go back wearing masks socially distancing. entirely them/their parents keep safe.

I'm going stop living life I'm sorry it. Comically incorrect. love people respond ""correlation != causation"" idea basic hypothesis testing work. Everyone talking existing variant finally making rounds Florida talking new variant originated Florida? wanted see paywall wouldn‚Äôt let me. guess article talking Lambda? must live US. doses going waste right anti vaxxers Damn. Sorry hear that. daughter ok far? Team Moderna here. far many type sub could seen restricting rights individuals. state would defend reasons allowing vaccine mandates. cares, need boost numbers. time petty. Let's clear. lot people point United States map Tito Ortiz probably something this. know came across someone covid? snark, rueful attempt stay positive form wanted believe over. still angrily clinging belief, check comments CDC announcement post. Human nature hasn‚Äôt really changed much since days Black Plague. huksters, deniers, magical thinkers back too. Months ago, Moderna study looked using half dose, found produced almost good immune response fewer side effects.

So standards early 2021, Moderna dose probably higher necessary, may explain seemed prone causing side effects Pfizer.

But standards July 2021, I‚Äôm glad dose higher. may kicked butt side effects days second shot, means might little extra protection now, worth it. got deleted today automod quoting linked article. many got corona either last weeks.

fair point. However, consider following:

cases = 40k / day = 280k / week. know cases underreported everywhere lot number reasons. possible actually 1 million cases per week. 2 weeks could 2 million 3% population (at least, 0.75% population, assuming every single case detected made statistics)

vaccinations = 4% population preceding 2 weeks got fully vaccinated, last 2 weeks reached full immunity

So +5-7% population gained immunity last 2 weeks, 10-14% last month. seem like would make much difference. concept ""herd immunity"" like that. virus spreads like crazy 0% immunity, 10%, 20%, .... 60%, 70%, 75% last % approaches magic number (say 83%), rates fall rapidly. Behaviour around tipping points quick.

Also, exposure variants virus gives nearly full immunity delta variant well. different (yet) can't really blame people/media CDC, agencies, credentialed medical experts seemed giving message. asterisk ""vaccines way this"", small enough us noticed. experts supposed listening to, right? point, unfortunately‚Ä¶ vaccine miracle drug? know vaccinated still catching covid right? hospitals vehicle accidents. outlaw kids cars? You‚Äôre ridiculous I‚Äôm seeing take lot, think it‚Äôs matter time confirm data 

(source: fully vaccinated (J&amp;J) caught covid fully vaccinated (Pfizer) roommate brief exposure) See reply 31 damn... young. people say kills disabled 50 Jeez CDC loves give ammo anti vaxxers really doesn‚Äôt care many people get sick die. Sounds like need therapy feel bad blue dots sea red Florida awesome. let ruin Nobody comply mask mandates since using correctly outside hospital/clinic setting near impossible.

I know personal observations anecdotal, seen single one customers able touch mask / cover nose / pull talk / user error think of. Yes, is. think I'm still waiting. sense smell never coming back another one seems reasonably common gonna refuse MIL see newborn until
She does? LOL we're not. ... like, wanted go get 3rd moderna shot, that's okay??

Or no? Asking me. impossible eradicate it, everyone going get vaccinated. would theoretically possible wipe out, I'm comfortable saying straight-up impossible reality, many people going get vaccinated. Understood thank information! üôè mixed numbers. Vermont 80% eligible population. Ireland 85%. This. current political climate. intelligent people know science actually is, process discovery, set dogma follow. 

The problem general public line thought lead tired old quack argument ""well, science theory!! never facts!"" justify kind quackery, flat earth, etc etc. difficult. Ugh, that's sad hear. step mother going get vaccine all, despite multiple grandchildren 3, realized able travel overseas unless vaccinated. Priorities, eh?

I hope kiddo recovers fast! That's fair. Breakthrough infections rare, never careful. vaccinated people less likely experience symptoms unvaccinated. dude kids, that‚Äôs choice. Better anyways since personally hate kids always ridicule do. Plus weed weak ones would nuts go finish line getting parents vaccinated go friends without worrying catching giving parents worrying they'd come it. crossed finish line, seems unvaccinated people painting brand new one way road. I'm furious. sure FL, local police MO even follow mask mandates themselves, much less enforce them. believe statistic also means vaccinated people 83% less likely get unvaccinated (or 17% likely, percentages hard)  didn‚Äôt kid. didn‚Äôt make decision bring world. That‚Äôs alone. means safety responsibility. Time keep home till vaccinations ready age group. Well. Everybody's gotta someplace. One person particular really isn‚Äôt political issue, don‚Äôt define such, exists group people assume everyone lives life based political views they/others hold. Let‚Äôs give power hold useless view world. wants stay house, doesn‚Äôt know afford hotel. üò¨  China got GPS app tells close infected. Can't happen usa cause: muh freedom vaccines don‚Äôt give immunity, still get ill spread virus around (albeit chances slimmer), herd immunity mean? virus still spread around mutate even 100% population vaccinated? children immunocompromised? spread virus let die? main issue getting vaccinated observing protocols. antivax. Florida state better California‚Ä¶. (Take account average age level influx people flocked state pandemic well) lockdown measures didn‚Äôt work way msm suggests. vaccinated pro vax expect people get vaccinated messaging now. Don‚Äôt forget Kamala said wouldn‚Äôt take jab trump ‚Äúorange mans vaccine‚Äù‚Ä¶ intellectual consistency would nice hate trump that‚Äôs fine think you‚Äôre smart due you‚Äôre idiot. work restaurant... test everyday week day off? quit job homeless? What's protocol us work places enforce little ass mandates place before, back ""normal""? Like they're acting like companies still working home shut down. 

I looking another job btw. darkest days *previously largest* peak

Fixed. Brb gonna go eat ice cream cry.  saying bought truckload toilet paper people even saw coming? Cold thing kinda funny, reason actually liked masked colds past yr allergies help. Wonder % vaccinated people choose booster. one really knows going happen. along ride. county Tennessee, 7-day rolling average went 10.7 cases per 100,000 23 cases per 100,000 July 21 July 27. Sigh... Arkansas 0 open ICU beds whole state. worst wave them. Last I'd checked second dose lower (barely 60%) that's confusion was. 

Ah yes, ""Redditor"" insult, truly classic. anti social, want amongst people last year taught many worryingly selfish lie often. want return normal there's enough people world refusing vaccines, take many encourage new strain (the claim immune compromised near zero risk bit bold. UK, like rest countries stationary places nobody visits places ever). saw weeks ago someone Britain claiming another subreddit lied getting vaccine could go see family's younger kids. 

Yes compare Boris Tories Trump Republicans, parties done lot fumbling dumb shit last year handling pandemic. Like, woohoo, actually got one us getting population jab, still incompetent party (how they've treated essential workers, especially nurses, anger inducing reminds great deal what's happening US). 

I want shift goal posts kinda hard to. None would gotten bad people stuck restrictions properly beginning 2020, instead whining able get hair cut see band play somewhere. everyone took seriously probably would dealing one strain today, lost many people. 

I've come across people claiming masks magical thing. type mask determine efficiency. far I'm aware N95s still cream crop even 100%. 

I like assumed become hermit still people waddling around unvaccinated. still go life world, irritating work around usual way I'm expected accommodate people put us mess. 

It's stay *unfortunately*, along variants have. Repost. obvious never ending lol Israel states 65% 6 mos. thought last year 14 day thing gone. Pretty sure 10 days. Keeping vaccinated ass house until, unfortunately,school starts vaxed high schooler. reckon surge really hit mid September amongst eligible kids whose parents chose vax families . We‚Äôre getting started. Scary times ahead. long covid. That‚Äôs concern. know it‚Äôs pretty common asymptotomatic people. transfer unknown vaccinated infections? Restrictions always around they're permanent obvious link document abstract. 

Don't forget read statement directly PDF link supposed guide article preprint **has certified peer review** [what mean?]. 

One thing means probably simply linked political journal prove reports new medical research **has yet evaluated** used guide clinical practice.
 
In comparison, paper Hill completely failed link much fear inducing document.  

So one question is

A) point PDF Yale Medical considered scientific yet?

vs.

B) link document current caveats?

Resolving important focus data engineering... particularly talking efficacy medical procedure all. 
 
The best ""answer"" might ""create booster"" right now... even might answer investment house thinks would good them. know that. think going happen either, are. Thanks! know that. faith them! found helpful read. Thank you.  supposed intervene? presidents deliberately written able overly authoritarian states‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ unless you‚Äôre proposing nationwide mask mandate, pretty BS states done part vaccinated low transmission rates someone feel makes sense. actually quoted something said last reply top commenter. Thank you. Lmao robust kills me. BC Canada 81% eligible one dose still going slowly. 64% fully 2nd doses still skyrocketing Like able enter Disney World? support consequence, right? absolutely that, problem won‚Äôt stay away mean, depends interested in.

If want find *what risk COVID hospitalization/death conditional exposed viral load otherwise sufficient infect you*, yes, want use different denominator.

If simply want find *what risk COVID hospitalization/death* is, looking percentage vaccinated people hospitalized/died instructive. slightly undersells risk (as people get exposed, number hospitalized rise), still instructive Same. point changing minds unvaxed. Let covid run natural course yolo. law enforcement officers refuse enforce mask mandates job so, need fired replaced others will.

There limits ask 7/11 checkout clerk comes dealing hostile anti-masker. anti-masker gets violent criminal, it‚Äôs police‚Äôs job deal criminals. they‚Äôre trained handle armed robbers, handle hostile anti-masker. want hospital bed staff lungs explode inflammation though. care point? I‚Äôve reading comments since get boy oh boy hive-mind shifted, especially last couple weeks. Yes. think whole ""14 days even negative test"" thing needs relaxed somewhat. vaccines, unemployment gone, employers bringing people back in. negative test mask days probably good enough vaccinated blame government bad mandate policies, anti-vaxxers every Covid death out. Plenty blame go around. Wait‚Ä¶ seriously?? It‚Äôs like we‚Äôre going backwards! Good thing order online pick order without going inside store. Except anti-vax rally /s  Florida fucking everything again. Fuck Florida real. oval-shaped nuggets pure gold pushed crap cavern, she'd best darn goose farm. Ditch sub substitute like 5 hobbies/interests/curiosities. Yeah, point unvaccinated people know age. They're really swayed idea protecting community rightfully believe unlikely get hospitalized/die covid relatively young/healthy people. idea might get less severe case got breakthrough infection compelling already think they're going get severe case.

I'm pretty good person conversation friends, too-- stint immunocompromised person dealing health issues years back. People get explain might able protect someone like me. point actually convinced people get flu shots past fall. covid vaccines apparently bridge far. *worst* south, broadly speaking, mean ""only really bad south"".

And idea stay way, either. People need stay top shit aware case trends area, regardless United States, quickly get bad again. Yep. counter ""all folk care sick dying!""

How virtuous 2 mayors! care everyone else!

Anyway, sidebar, present fact: population world increased last 18 months.

There ""sick dying"", yes, let's exaggerate much is. constituents dying droves. Totally get that, 18 months past months started resemble normalcy delta variant like nope. It‚Äôs frustrating, even introvert. needs end point.

Sorry shake comfortable little life no, pandemic going end neatly closing ceremony like Olympics.

This virus attempt spread mutate way every human Earth can. might wake tomorrow faced variant completely negates available vaccines.

If learn nothing else pandemic, least accept this: world something tweak suit human needs forever. going keep throwing wrenches plans. 'normal' ever hope go back to. CDC director exactly zero credibility. also said predicted ‚Äúimpending doom‚Äù right entered best longest period control disease we‚Äôve far. No, biggest issue people getting vaccinated. far. brother law sister knew didn‚Äôt get tested exactly purpose! ""I refuse abide rules! want can't tell even others die due actions!!""

""Can free money pwetty please ü•∫ü•∫ü•∫""

They sound like spoiled brat lol  Fair. use Apple products anymore, Dad gone stores going get fix anywhere else, warranty. lmao dipshits think they're fucking william braveheart wallace dont schedule cvs appointment get jab refuse wear fucking piece cloth. really think theyre sticking government. small town folk damn cringe. could understand restaurants forced shut down. fined way received funds risk losing liquor license. think recall booster actually would lower dose Pay back?

Essentially showed proof used loan keep employees paid despite work, loan forgiven. POOF. DEBT GONE.

Hell even think forgiveness taxable either. Yeah walk person's shoes tells whole story. financially devastated pandemic, emotionally due complete loss one favorite hobbies: international travel. patience knowing one day return. Paying rent time? That's something term patience really applies. Fortunately suffer economic harm, try imagine frustrating must people have. Im sure that. big problem seems sheer anti intellectualism point fact half country literally doesnt believe vaccines. Seriously, Uber place I've consistently interacted anti-vaxers most. 

Some crazy shit I've heard drivers say... really appreciate ones worried tracking. Like think phone literally right now? 84k today [This Sure, Sure, Quite well. air pleasant, go somewhere fresher. kids that, ya know? friend could test meet you? think anti vaxxers deserve much scorn people get vaccinated want go back living life. least got vaccinated. remember Spain also 1% support Iraq war too. actually bet idiot would taken seriously got base take seriously, wear masks, socially distance etc, would lot less people died, prob wins reelection. god, even breathe head far ass? won't, gift government. State's rights, city's rights, apparently? also go Apple store minor repairs

Not should. Apple Apple, way overcharge simple fix, replace whole logic board something fixable cheaply without replacing whole board. I'm Thailand people calling train Busan. I‚Äôm interested school guidance change. point need mask district said weren‚Äôt going temp checks health attestations. guess month find out.  This. understand modern people think cure invented months time, era marketing team speaks loudest. never zoomed. Adopt dog. Totally. I‚Äôve worn mask everywhere since I‚Äôve gotten back. Even though everywhere go I‚Äôm 5% still wearing one‚Ä¶ also ‚Äúeverywhere‚Äù target grocery store buy food. I‚Äôm vaccinated. Yes, it‚Äôs me. Maine here. Similarly, we're split. Southern coastal Maine blue. Northern western deep red. GOP gearing ram horrible, racist ex-governor Paul LePage back throats. I'm digging tunnel Canada. anyone 3rd dose here? Would like hear side effects compared first two. know first shot nothing second shot chills. wonder third shot likely effect us. ""I want get MR. RONAS WILD RIDE."" rules dont go business. Fauci go. doctor #1 thing trust. masks, well actaully masks. Came pengolin, well actually always thought lab leak possible. question question science. guy joke. Nice Yeah couldn‚Äôt keep spreading unvaxed point could mutate effect vaccinated people? worse mistake CDC made throughout whole pandemic saying vaccinated didn‚Äôt wear masks. guess thought would encourage people get vaccine, since can‚Äôt visually see someone it, meant one wear masks anymore. You‚Äôre correct, sucks got downvoted much. follow lot prominent infectious disease researchers unanimously view. Although also positive well vaccines continue protect people injury death.

We defeat covid 19 sense become disease unvaccinated (already is, really). Almost everyone else survive problems. yeah, endemic now. It‚Äôs going eradicated, controlled. I'm confused paper directed paper Hill linked referring to.

Welcome data science cousin data study ongoing simply enough data yet vaccine effectiveness time simply enough time passed.

Right. projections say vaccine might lose efficacy particular rate. patients injected long - yet.

Now two forces work: science. And... engineering. Science says sure level deterioration efficacy actually people injected long. count them.

But engineering ""better"" answer. unfortunately worse one too. better answer - takes us x amount months come booster effective. mean time virus becoming probably effective own. 

But we're going need time build next booster. want get started fast possible. that?

Well target worst case. means either go speed virus petri dish simulated environment tap Congress funding build what...

To build next booster shot. ""next best thing"" stop virus. study funded Pfizer BioNTech understand vaccine time

They also understand Congress time... Vaccine building engineering discipline. takes certain amount time. Think quite know we're going build study funded Pfizer BioNTech understand vaccine time

I think they're irresponsible.

One Thanks. I've started following sub really disheartening people complain still need wear masks stuff us access kind vaccine. even get vaccinated, I'll probably banned traveling US Europe it'll likely one Chinese vaccines. terrifying. Ireland. We're track one vaccinated populations world, although master proportion children, might bring us down. Dude. going almost 18 months now, optionally perpetuated giant group worthless morons can‚Äôt assed help anything else. 

I think wanting pretty reasonable. put past seize first mistake trump makes try drive wedge trump supporters.

the entire allure trump political sycophants' base, see chance take base leave behind, they'll jump it. pediatric cohorts? Well... yeah. something like 98-99% hospitalizations unvaccinated people, obviously rolling dice getting jabbed. justify permanent restrictions?? vaccines way out? Nah guess  Well, starting see results 4th July shenanigans across country. leads that, clue. California sneaking though.  could say DeWine Ohio, seems nuts along, covid put brighter spotlight them. Nanny cam dude/tte! Problem solved ü§ì God it‚Äôs long day lol ‚ÄúEveryone freedom choice unless disagree me! wont infect mutate vax'd humans highly vax'd soiceties (cough Israel).

Is virus likely learn evade vaccine vax'd host unvax'd host?

Stupid human thinks get COVID 0 see thing years years come covered employer. point ready wear mask alone home. virus crazy dangerous. garbage person, exactly problem world we‚Äôre absolutely doomed States refused entry citizens states beginning pandemic. (Desantis) could‚Äôve tailored better response suit needs Floridians. I‚Äôd argue state. think he's asking know that's CDC's study. thought relied measurements published (which almost quite bad). back masks non-vaccinated guests. Probably gonna while, huh? Wait know safe. 2 vaccines risky imagine would Biden much power there, sticking nose allow desantis claim ""beat"" Biden, bolstering hero loons. I‚Äôve reading top comments replies thread hardly anyone mentioning this!!! kind want shout next daily thread post. 
KIDS &lt;12 ABLE GET VACCINATED STILL RISK!!!  eat pizza. would use vaccine manner approved. someone explain anyone would choose get vaccine gives higher chance disorders/complications/death chance originally dying virus? makes sense me.

And I've COVID twice &amp; die ... third time then? guess, safest would unvaccibated people. negative tests, vaccine proof. FL center pack USA COVID death rate one oldest populations. Besides Republican measure look makes death look worse options? Miami major hub travel Latin America surprising Florida would first state Latin American variant would appear in.

As awful Florida's COVID response been, one really state. Well remote learning become permanent Canada soon 1/6th likely. 

Like, vaccinated person would encounter six times instances exposure unvaccinated person order get sick.

Another way thinking it: unvaccinated person went party got sick it, vaccinated person would go party, bar Friday night, pot luck dinner, Church, work next day, volunteer shelter one night, someone sick place, order reach risk level getting sick unvaccinated person. (This means scientific example, food thought.) current vaccines still super effective serious illness death. We‚Äôre going back started. ""employees must wash hands."" You‚Äôre right PTSD. It‚Äôs hard think ‚Äúoh shit go again.‚Äù media toxic af, absolutely capitalized people‚Äôs anxieties fears fucked up. family members glued front TV last year scared death. returning ‚Äúnormal‚Äù since vaccinated I‚Äôm worried set back. remember vaccines secondly, many cases majority hospitalizations unvaccinated. breakthrough cases, said rare expected happen anyways result vaccine 100%

??? understand might become wonky mask wearing, ""returning normal?""  Yeah even charge I'll getting booster I‚Äôm gonna real you. Years. It‚Äôs gonna years. Delta variant rage now. much world barely vaccinated. What‚Äôs percentage Central America? Steppes Asia? Almost Africa? Southeast Asia?

This virus still many places mutate population that‚Äôs barely vaccinated. I‚Äôm sure get a‚Ä¶.Beta variant say‚Ä¶..Bangladesh. Gamma variant starts Zimbabwe. 

Sadly strap in. America never shut like 2020 would bet almost $$$ see covid shots flu shot, needing booster every year combat new strains Cold season vary region, especially country big US. Mild cold symptoms also overlap general allergies. also overlap flu times. covid. 

Colds still circulating surprised hear fact cold season, generally know it, wonky year us trying return normal. Adults big children Fuck...

Seriously fuck... fully vaccinated mid-May many stupid fucks bothered get vaccinated heading back masks testing again. getting used wearing mask public Target places masking trying convince fully vaccinated wife - stubborn wearing mask working out. vaccines work better every could hoped started. problem enough public vaccinated get rid thing, Hospital admissions trending need beds things covid. 

While extremely safe vaccinated person would think still want hospital bed available get car accident get different disease. everyone around social situations vaccinated good. question cost benefit bugs me. First, places unvaccinated people implement guidance. places higher vaccination rates will.

Second, since vaccinated people already done part reduce contribution spread substantially, deserve freedom back. new mask mandates spell doom live event industries, entertainment venues, trade shows barely getting ground again. Many freelance workers utterly fucked, pandemic aid programs ending. blow morale staggering.

It feels like punch gut vaccinated people, everything right gave much protect others long, go backwards even though small contributors total spread. Especially since CDC's reasoning poorly cited, since one's risk catching therefore spreading Covid ever zero, there's end sight. Sorry cheer for? people upvoted topic even thought it? told vaccines slow virus transmissions. suddenly still need wear masks. vaccination non-risk group, like me? here. husband got Modena. second dose April 23- month first.  Oh. asking I've seen commenters insisting cold symptoms outside cold season likely sign COVID infection. Absence evidence evidence absence

I disagree phrase. mean sure evidence, proof. Like search purse three times keys without finding them, evident (although totally proven).

Somehow xenophobic Governor couldn‚Äôt even protect borders. hate people. tried respect decision, ridiculous. taking vaccine possibility harming others around you. we're expected let people let decide they'll take vaccine. 

However, taking vaccine 'harms' besides yourself? giving people taking hard time. dumb. want smack anyone mindset.

This rush back office dumb indicative way U.S. handles things CDC's constant flip-flops.

I know Google progressive this, I'd say New York City, used work Manhattan, among status-quo driven, likely allow large-scale WFH U.S., entire world.

Way many middle management old school types need butts seats justify egos.

Literally yesterday, Cuomo said NYC even sees 15% reduction workforce return, city toast. FIFTEEN... PERCENT. Meanwhile, almost large scale tech company looking 50% reduction actual policy going forward.

Cuomo also said wants companies NYC mandate office returns Labor Day. Delta surging biggest problem might schools people children 12 immunocompromised home.

It is, quite honestly, sickening hope there's something place protect people worry unvaxxed home (because can't vaxxed yet) let go refusing participate money driven charade. suggested immune system differences people bipolar schizophrenia could possibly explain higher risks groups. 

Where ever say that??? 

Because even listed abstract. said number social medical factors *contributated* infection, immune system.

Having mental health condition severity affect immune system directly. That's physical issue, said future studies look risk death mental health disorder, opposed mental health disorders whole.

So, they're suggesting even study scientists concluded: ‚ÄòPatients mental health disorders targeted high-risk population severe forms Covid-19, requiring enhanced preventive disease management strategies.

Such exactly? preventative methods? virologists now? severe form Covid associated mental future studies evaluate risk mental health disorder, could determined current published data.‚Äô

""which could determined current published data.""

So data using? come findings?

I really wish people would understand medical ""papers"" published online guarantee peer-review.

And going find peer-reviewed articles freely-accessed website. friend mine similar situation mother. going eating group 4 one friends decided come suffering almost complete loss taste senses even telling us afterwards. 

And suprise suprise got tested positive. Luckily tested negative 5 days, pissed mainly friend lives mother cancer. I've actually wondering loose vaccine card, get ""booster""? Like, record I've vaccinated little card? shouldn't. Macro vs micro. Unless know fact caused death specific person anti-vax stuff, worry much that. Prior variants proven extremely unlikely infect vaccinated person even less likely vaccinated person spread it.

The vaccines still prevent hospitalization death vaccinated high level much contagious variants spreading, particularly areas low vaccination rates. may seem like extreme measure we're close beating thing public would get vaccinated.

I think public economy would respond another 2 week shutdown point. feeling? fuck Kevin. toddler one three whole chock-full covid pediatric department city three weeks ago, so‚Ä¶ seemed like mostly teens time. Everything always boils money, doesn‚Äôt it? point #1...I really wish CDC medical community would clarify specific odds fully vaccinated individual spreading disease. reddit seems think vaccine absolutely nothing regards transmission. Tldr: antivax moron good Honestly good them. Family/friends really terrible, I‚Äôm glad courage get vaccine own. Good job guys! Maybe others see strength go get vaccine too. state breaks numbers. Maybe need ask local government level? we‚Äôd mandated shut nationally get go. Nationwide shutdown mask mandate March 2020. Instead guy telling us go work sick. that's rights start conflict. talking politicized court would decide, talking could challenged functioning court system. UK they're majority. Seems they're trying cover weak shots effecting spread infection deeming sort rare breakout case  certainly agree this. However, considering Yankees 25% vaccinated testing positive Nationals around 30%, wonder higher people medical settings. front line workers still wearing masks? rest us vaccinated, like me, I've going gym, ballgames, outdoor parties, vacations/hotels/museums, etc. unmasked. recommendations folks without proper PPE. treating covid fully donned need test unless symptomatic Thank info. Absolutely Currently, Biden administration immediately turning back many migrants Title 42, allows agents make migrants return Mexico risk spreading COVID-19. practice began Trump administration.

Yeah, expect we'll get high vaccine approved kids - pediatricians working families well-child visits come next year. lot people go doctor bring children pediatrician - people listen kids' doctor too.

I'm also really hoping workplace mandates make difference well. old employer mandated vaccines people refused. I'm still waiting hear grapevine handled.

I guess main point I'm ready give yet stragglers. Every day we're better shape past day.  vaccine check thing - required shown bars/restaurants/et al (events 100 people currently) show vaccinated, recovered, recent negative test. Oh boy, mods r/Disneyworld going freak out. ban anyone asking masks covid safety. Seatbelts easily provable work, show dummy crash test explanation needed.

And yet people still spent decades saying need seat belts ""I'm going get accident.""

The way fixed passing laws imposing fines. anecdotes i'm hearing breakthrough cases place. ranging anywhere ""i idea got tested"" ""mild cold"" ""the worst i've ever felt"" hospitalization death.

i'm hoping get solid data soon know breakthrough cases keep relying anecdotes. Oh gosh, sound like mother...
:(  majority deaths cases 50s UK fully vaccinated people. death rate also 2% normal levels. asking questions here. Little higher, remember many people get paid work. many come back hospital stay find job filled. Right. Everyone subreddit obsessive subjectivity. thing! virus evades vaccine becomes seasonal need vaccinated seasonally. least US, government could easily tied stimulus check vaccination. Poor guy poor kids. 

I hope gets kids vaccinated they're old enough. sad situation. studies USA looking boosting J&amp;J mRNA vaccines? going study 1? ""no true Scotsman"" guys.  People seem understand vaccination stop infection

Several large studies regularly tested participants found vaccinated people significantly less likely test positive COVID relative unvaccinated. CDC study front line workers put reduction positive PCR tests 90% mRNA vaccines. 

I agree decades life front there's high likelihood eventually get COVID, though keep recommended vaccination live community high vaccination rates think unheard people avoid entirely. still released correction. One data scientist posted Twitter. Still waiting Health Ministry release actual reports findings. Data scientist least provided details included original report : country, Greece, 8 days ago. claim mandatory vaccination it‚Äôs still protest vaccines. brother law boat. wife told would divorce got vaccinated took kids get vaccinated. deep Covid/Trump conspiracy land even funny. stated reason believes vaccine leaches onto people, everyone tainted vaccine turn zombies year 3 years. 

On plus side got vaccine couple months ago anyways, far know still know did. Australian here: first fucking shots Americans get third please? New mutations infectious severe hospitalizations low. shows vaccines shite preventing transmissions, clear reason non-risk group get vaxxed. That's true, addition stupid Republicans giving people hard time decisions help others, stupid Republicans blue areas lie vaccinated, putting others risk. 

They stupid hate public health everywhere. bring back green pass all

What's green pass? question is, vaccinated test positive covid, long infectious? days? Longer? I‚Äôm sick masking take care unvaccinated too.

California know single parent whose kid go maskless... - that's new article numbers, charts, data articles. trust it. even sure government - bring back green pass - would undue burden real value ""studies"" believed. release data - best world state managed hmo. negative. problems:

1. CDC's messaging terrible here. state vaccinated people spread Covid sick without mentioning relatively likely is. rely data published. issue guidance followed regions need to. focus cloth masks instead things effective, like N95s antibody treatments. ignore public's desire clear plan get back normal.

It feels like gave peer pressure instead thinking best communicate way greatest practical effect pandemic.

2. Isreal's data far line published studies topic. share methodology. recently found likely error math explaining discrepancy. exactly saying. Yeah amount mental physical growth I‚Äôve seen back gym significant. close I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôll bad place. wife vaccinated December works healthcare setting covid positive patients I‚Äôm also asking her. Mutations happen virus reproduces minimizing virus reproduction greatly reduces supply dangerous mutations. People immunity (either natural vaccine) begin suppressing virus day 1, people without immunity fight uphill battle mount proper inmune response virus reproduces large numbers, main difference natural immunity vaccines people natural immunity contributed virus first time.

The argument natural selection side, get variants, complex unlike bacteria antibiotics, immunity vaccines similar natural immunity, selection pressure would same. case would argument zero-covid, nobody thinks viable anymore, vaccination.

Private companies also slow adopt new mask mandates adopt well. Look quick dropped May example. Thankfully vaccines effective headlines lately horrible. agree you. tone news completely shifted. sure really real increase deaths hospitalizations Headline read: ""Facebook employees get vaccinated avoid returning office, claims pajamas favorite work attire""


I believe group reporting vaccinated, solely avoid forced back going work. companies want employees working remotely dies down, then, rush everyone that's vaccinated back office. might bargaining chip. Hopefully vaxxed, report it, choose route. plague enthusiasts stop mingling made new mutations 4.7 times infectious vanilla covid started year ago.

Idiot. curiosity called covid rep said rule still us. THIS. retail non high paying jobs never can't staff today way adding additional mandates would help hiring seeing hold outs young fold. 

I think big game - 2 months it'll hope. Covid forever additional vaccines, boosters, et al company want enforce / monitor this. lockdowns cause mental health disorders, time become thing past. Mandatory masking temporary holdover better alternative. better alternative, it‚Äôs readily available months now: getting vaccinated. still feel unsafe, good news, M95 masks protect wearer.

There‚Äôs nothing saying can‚Äôt wear one, part. masked up. locked down. didn‚Äôt see family members year. postponed major life events. got vaccinated even eligible finding place unused doses missed appointments.

Don‚Äôt ask more, you‚Äôre getting any.

I‚Äôm vaccinated I‚Äôm safe. going pretend like I‚Äôm put social pressure unvaccinated mask too. can‚Äôt use social pressure shame unvaccinated want shame begin with. urge non-COVID-vaxxed get vaccine. They‚Äôll say what‚Äôs point.

That's cool, looking study 39 infected health-care workers? Sorry, settings exactly real-world general population, good statistically.

There like 100.000.000 cases virus year. must possible include bit 39 study shaping understanding it? view myopic. course ended global vaccination rate 14%. can‚Äôt vaccinate country forget rest world. fair here, testing sites either free super cheap. home testing. least know of.

For sure states testing, testing ton. think, overall, US numbers accurate 1st worlds. guess, likely mostly missing asymptomatic cases.

But 100% guarantee US going one largest covid hotspots September October.

Once schools reopen, good 30+% population consistently intermingling first time year. US colleges require masks vaccines. states, illegal require mask schools.

I actually work college. despite everything done, fully expect get Covid Fall, even wearing n95s vaccinated. see 1000s people week hours end. surveys show 3/10 students average vaccinated. Texas. complete shitshow here.

I still can't believe many people getting vaccine. blows mind. Hrm, really wondering person responding vaccinated not. strange reason I'm gonna guess 'no.' point, use misinformation advantage. mean, CNN news media network milked milked milked hell missing Malaysian flight, they're almost certainly going covid. They're talking cases cause that's gets people anxious attracts viewership, that's they're mentioning death hospitalization rates. Said earlier media capitalizing fear, trauma mental health disorders people developed year (anxiety, depression, ocd, etc) it‚Äôs fucked up. kinda come personal choice, it?

Virus mutate fully vaccinated society, partially vaccinated society. death count much lower, since critical population vaxxed. 

We situation people want vaccinated so, people can't wont (if choose to) take precautions.

I really see point lockdowns mandates always spread virus regardless makes population annoyed unhappy. thought NZ operating time, letting outsiders in? hundred pediatric hospital beds, though. Many convinced unvaccinated think. Yet, 7-day average vaccinations US past days - much, definitely collapsing 0 either, would getting bribed wear mask main motivator yet gotten it. wanes, weigns. sorry really bothered man starting look like friend's 11-year-old son Syndrome spend another year learning -- learning, tends -- remotely. she'll spend another year working part-time struggles supervise education least gets something it.  Would even absurd police assault rifles now. Fox also recognized base fans dying rapidly. realizing it‚Äôs base refusing safety precautions living like nothings happening. come next election, voters support bull?

Which there‚Äôs big pro vax push network now. save voters future election. doesn‚Äôt anything actually caring base it‚Äôs purely political. beyond disgusting Oh, time Governor Kemp waste state tax dollars suing mayor again? Nice, basically 0 arguments left motivate convince friends/colleagues dont want get jabbed whatever reason.... I'm worrying elective surgery November. Please overrun hospitals again, anti-vaxxers! vaccinated, started wearing mask CDC announcement came day two ago. Prior maskless. maybe people start wearing nose propagates.

Wednesday night I'm sure even 10% local Publix, though. England using Moderna Pfizer 40s. Nearly everyone 40 plus got AZ. 40s 30s contacted get told would getting 1 2 types instead. 

So rolled vaccine program everyone ages 18 beginning July (I think), larger amount people getting Moderna before. aren‚Äôt even offering virtual???!! That‚Äôs awful!!! Never mind they‚Äôre literally erasing history anti CRT curriculum point‚Ä¶but willingly harm hundreds kids. there‚Äôs budget safe virtual, accessible learning fall.

What‚Äôs worse is, homeschool barely option. Many homes dual incomes mean two working parents. one available take homeschool teacher.

I‚Äôm sorry it‚Äôs mess Texas right now. Stay safe healthy Sir, Taco Bell. vaccine protection declines every month. truly fucked. initial outbreak, wife colleague basically two managers believed COVID pharmacy department went great deal effort professional sacrifice protect employees, hospital denying seriousness aggressively pushing anti-mask agenda. Retrospectively, many employees incredibly thankful efforts, grasp seriousness time. 

Neither wife lost anyone COVID. colleague parents infected COVID around January 2021. mother passed quickly hospital. father hospitalized, recovered fully.  2 months later, hike daughter (the colleague) collapsed, dying arms. suspect delayed myocardial issue related infection, knows. 

I'm thankful family lost anyone immediate family, wife's colleague one best people know life tangibly altered result. shitty anti-karma, irony whatever. another anecdote among many. never said think stopped lol went first concert year half last week. don‚Äôt anything else.

There's noise last days suggesting Israel may screwed calculations.
 good idea people wear masks ""vaccinated"". knew gonna bad idea people vaccinated going go around pretending vaccinated. 


Fast forward now...and country wants start wearing masks again...because vaccinated wannabes. important, avoid friends family. go meet people long wear mask supermarket? minimim 4 shots.

Its covid cards.

Its planned.

It supposed TEN shots per year stock investors. ridiculous. Lmao 40k dead counting go dude ok numbers head trauma kids wearing helmets? famil member recently posted, sincerely, Facebook.

‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt suspicious people aren‚Äôt getting vaccine getting sick?‚Äù

I can‚Äôt even play devil's advocate perhaps one reason hearing clear endgame (the current administration) want look like goofballs exit strategy work planned timeline lay out. Like want avoid saying things like it'll gone ""by Easter"" FWIW exposed directly May several days, tested negative twice. vaccinated since Feb. I‚Äôve genuinely hated Florida long time everyone seems asshat. top that, elect worst worst pieces shit like deSantis. Hope get proven wrong soon. Yeah you‚Äôre right. 

Until following even virulent vaccination-busting variant comes along behind it. I'm definitely not. Nobody know stupid. really give easily? don‚Äôt really think Mitch McConnell Florida

Incidentally, though despise McConnell politician including One, ***is*** least big masks vaccinations. He's big since day one campaign funding pro-vaccination ads TV Kentucky. 

So that's 999 awful things man 1 good thing. boosters help keep infections down, it‚Äôs going necessary.

Ok sorry guys, even though vaccines relatively safe, certainly risk-free. I'm getting 3rd booster shot vaccine, increasing risk side effects, sole purpose protecting actively choose get avoid side effects. England

I know places let make appointment online, I'm still anxious prospect walk somewhere talk people. places show designated area time appointment someone come administer vaccine (and check ID, guess- sounds like places bother check...)?

From descriptions I've read, sounds like places require walk talk somebody, direct somebody else, direct yet another person...is anywhere avoids chain people, inevitable? want use kids punish them. shit difficult I'm sure news beginning pandemic, things happening, people pretend like never major goal vaccinations.

To fair though, since goal formulated, rules changed bit. original know, 70% requiring vaccination sounded achievable, higher-R0 versions virus percentages needed sound realistic more. I'm afraid Long Covid dying tbh. mean, know chances dying low since I'm vaccinated.

* Better indoor ventilation air filtration, along ultraviolet anti-bacterial antiviral technologies.

* Better treatments people covid, instead relying keeping people getting it.

* effective approaches keep epidemics turning pandemics, improving national quarantines border controls.

* Much funding focus public health agencies general apparently something backwater recent decades.

It's good think pandemic could learning experience would start moving things positive direction. Vaccines.. varient spreads crazy fast can't keep locking down, economy screwed. material. Well said. last 18 months? couple cities shut down. majority country did. part wrong? hope so! states told vaccinated people basically return normal life worry, are. Unvaccinated delta variant working overtime undue progress responsible people making. Germany need tests anything pandemic. go cafe? write contact details piece paper.

They used require tests month back, matter whether fully vaccinated not.

It's crazy me. least work everyone still required wear masks, bloody well stop anyway. 

My grocery chain even stopped selling Covid home tests weeks back. week everyone gets free one purchase 30, dumped whole stock. get people daily asking tests again.


No idea governments plan is. numbers also steadily raising.

I understand hard fully implement mask mandate keep place pandemic over, make tests social outings mandatory. Like already got testing shops tents every 50 feet town. use them?! ask me, seem good time taking road trip US. obviously heading big new spike, cases doubling every week two, especially Southeast Midwest, Delta variant seems pretty active.

""Road trip"" sounds like would driving around car, obviously eating restaurants, staying hotels, perhaps going bars tourist spots, on.

Masks going fix this. reality, almost nothing could've done (other vaccinating 100X people quickly did) would've defeated Delta variant. Exactly thoughts. answers matter. make reasons counter. we‚Äôre going things, slowly. reason culture people love defiant little, ol‚Äô vaccine. sure reach people besides Covid reaching them. It‚Äôs like they‚Äôve become Pharaoh biblical stories whose heart hardened never changed mind things things hit close home. Even then, though, people still defy virus sadly ask vaccine point thinking it‚Äôs cure.

Why? forced get tested?  get herd immunity, outbreak stays small local. enough vaccinated, people act firewall. prevent pandemics. 

The way get absolutely zero cases get 100% vaccination rate let cases burn out.

And less cases smaller shorter outbreaks, less chance mutation happening break everyone immunity. Idiot here. Would suggest living fear  understanding applies you‚Äôve notified someone you‚Äôve around recently positive COVID test (ie family member/friend/coworker/etc). believe guidance says would exposed 15 minutes. CDC wants control shit, need partial shutdown country. point, refuse get vaccinated, stop listening. Unless force hand, they're going change. Let's black plaque virus getting enough deaths. don‚Äôt want return office live there. distinction, questioning leads additional studies sure, questioning leads nothing ignore data science wrong. Fucking yikes. That‚Äôs hell chart. hope predictions prevented.

SCOTUS case made pretty clear constitutional? shutting anything point.

Three years zombification! Since insurance refused cover first test I‚Äôll passing new one. Interesting, stand corrected there. still think kind mandate would end court (possibly supreme court). Smallpox case fatality rate ~30% compared 1% Covid. I'm speculating here, anti-vaxxers would probably attack ""under pressure great dangers"" language. also looks like could get vaccine fine ($5, $100-$150 today's dollars). anti-vaxers would probably lose end day, court case would tie things months-years. vaccinate this? thought oral one. serious mental gymnastics. wearing masks big deal either. Small price pay feel like shit even vaccinated. bit anecdote here, I've noticing reports popping ER/ICUs filling people lining halls hospitals earlier year/late last year. I'd put money deaths lower big wave vaxxed getting alive/not needing go hospital. Yes, vaccine absolutely reduces chance hospitalization death.

That honestly sounds great. assume they‚Äôre at-home tests? It‚Äôs easy enough get tests Canada, unfortunately still need go testing location it. results usually next day. So, pretty quick, you‚Äôd still need working home every day you‚Äôre waiting result. would me!!! nope, NEVER get it. Sorry slow ya ;) wont.  Okay, need basic probability primer here. vaccines work - effectiveness 80-90% range. However, 100%. means vaccinated get sick spread disease. long huge numbers cases going around, meaning large numbers exposures, lead large number vaccinated cases, people infect unvaccinated, likely get seriously ill, put strain healthcare systems, die. Unfortunately, means restrictions may needed vaccinated, long cases remain high. people vaccinated, shorter time cases high, restrictions lifted.

Especially kids 12 vaccinated altering life 1% preliminary evidence put forward government UK suggested delta may double chances hospital across board compared alpha. unvaxxed person MASSIVELY higher chance hospitalization vaccinated person demographic, large risk small risk may doubled delta.

That said, double small risk still small risk, someone fully vaccinated immunocompromised something I'm particularly worried personal level, though probably needs taking account population level (when planning things like hospital capacity etc).

If look r/coronavirusuk we're along delta wave people postibg lot graphs etc. show good picture vaccines high cases. There's good one gets updated every days shows lines cases, hospital admissions, deaths overlaid atop one another, shows lines tracked identically past diverging strongly now. Scotland exit wave peaked around 4000 day previous record like 2.5k day, yet hospital admissions time peaked quarter previous wave. Long covid less data yet, I'm sure that's coming. 

Basically little ago exactly people thread are, worried seeking info terrified we'd plunged back heavier restrictions. road map did, rather sensibly, get altered, especially Scotland. we're feeling bit sure footed. much data kind know better stand now. beginning delta wave idea expect first highly vaccinated country get hit it, guys benefit data!

No, understanding one concerns behind CDC‚Äôs masking testing recommendations. Vaccinated unvaccinated people spread virus equally, contributes community transmission producing possible future variants. Nice see places world still sense community desire protect everybody. ‚ÄòHoosier hospitality‚Äô means welcome cesspool individuality. think many people believe they're 100% incapable transmission infected they're vaccinated. people would continue go mild symptoms rather take test quarantine necessary. 

The emphasis also messages even vaccinated people need mask CDC believes vaccinated people could viral shed. Unvaccinated people suppose mask already, recent CDC recommendation changes recommendations vaccinated people. isn‚Äôt argument. I‚Äôm stating facts; you‚Äôre obviously welcome continue disagreeing them. 600% Paranoid paranoia convenient excuse socially acceptable cause people back off. Good. need get society back normal. Funny think think vaccine effective people making I'm automatically antivaxxer case trust vaccine rushed quickly lot testing first, would love get shot I'm going wait bit longer see effects rest population even decide getting around 140 million unvaccinated people, 70 million infections would lead complete overrun healthcare system couple million deaths What‚Äôs point vaccinated twisted reality vaccine much dangerous actual virus. pedantic all. look ""well good it"" government able force medical decisions people something also used ill.

Do know AstraZeneca‚Äôs vaccine good? ""we"".

And 80% eligible meaning precisely?

There several different flavors stupid, come rainbow stupid, stick favorite stupid *no matter what* Since CDC interested data? agency still refuses collect complete data delta infections. change anything. People using ""is even fully approved"" excuse find new excuse. Likely ""why take long get approved"" something like that. go get one. mom this...we abundance vaccine CDC taking forever make announcement. you‚Äôre concerned. I‚Äôm gonna drive 20 miles CVS certainly wouldn‚Äôt spend $20 one sniffles. free maybe I‚Äôd drive, even I‚Äôm sure. young people get vaccine all? people, 0 crazy amount understand science even basic level. also consider India 4.000.000 excess deaths: See post above.

Symptoms big part, regular testing thing. like smart kid class playing dumb fit in. Sad. think they're saying lot anti-covid19 vaccine people issue many vaccinations. hardcore anti-vax people reject US, many people really refusing get political reasons mix misinfo/disinfo, lot similar arguments serious anti-vaxers make, try make sound like science back decision. think Democrats / liberals / ""the left"" support wearing masks, mitigation policies, getting vaccinated, mindlessly reject things. article actually suggests that's key factor:

""All 37 people data available infected unvaccinated person, **usually within homes**.""

I find fairly reassuring, least.  remember seeing kid pass out. *Those days* could see case another stimulus virus mutates around current vaccines healthcare system overwhelmed. Another stay-at-home order sounds impossible bringing back masks. Should‚Äôve gotten vaxxed need mandate Classic *automoderator won‚Äôt let use appropriate word describe political philosophy here* thinking. 

They view enemies inexplicably degenerate, stupid, disorganized, weak, subhumans incapable producing anything good pull everyone else them, exact time they‚Äôre also somehow insidiously clever powerful masters huge organized conspiracies control entire world. UK said accent new information, contrary old information hype it. premise put information people already. There's much benefit yield walking podium every day say, ""Guys, know heard us yesterday apparently listening. There's vaccine. safe, effective free. Please get shot."" political appetite this. focus right infrastructure deal. think would lead CDC relaxing mask school guidance around end 2021 early 2022? whole ""shedding"" thing makes think heard someone say ""if get vaccinated, risk around you"" said ""hmm that's good argument. I'm going start saying thing like, opposite"". MD here. Depends contact. 

If masked, sitting across desk person shows symptoms time together less 15 mins, nothing.

Anything severe get tested three times week two weeks exposure take temperature twice day, keep working. symptom, matter mild, gets immediately sent home.

For someone sent home immediately, would take pretty intense contact. Like Covid patient spits eye, intubate someone without mask on.


I tested three times week better part December March lol, never got Covid (vaxed January).

These local, non American guidelines, sure applicable is. scroll way bottom news posts like see disgraced graveyard; u real one. yeah people use theory justification believing real danger taking necessary precautions mentioned Seriously was, IIRC held city could fine person getting vaccinated. weren‚Äôt required get vaccine. there‚Äôs new Florida variant (b.1.621) rising fast‚Ä¶10% state‚Äôs cases even given name.

How works instead producing virus specific antibodies attack virus - instead 'DRACO' substance waits body - within bodies cells perhaps - virus infects cell DRACO destroys said infected cell. substance designed specifically detect whether infection happens.

So means like substance probably protect flu virus, COVID 19.. Common cold.. Etc..

Though substance maybe antiviral actual vaccine - still could last maybe actually make DRACO actual vaccine somehow getting body produce DRACO itself.

Here news article  #ReleaseTheData Someone said reference 10s 1000s children wound ICUs due Covid, ""What talking about, 13 year old covid fine"".

That's them. affects them. kid fine. care kids may be. Well area (downstate NY) example considered ‚Äúsubstantial‚Äù hospitalizations low vaccination rates high.  Everyone likely need repeated vaccination. Neutralizing antibodies drop time like 90% viruses. even previously infected people's levels drop eventually. think recommend shots previously infected people. 

I tell specifics, especially Delta, kind expected beginning. Delta increased urgency. 

Luckily, vaccine natural immune produce long term immune responses (t cell b cell). Neither stop getting infected, spreading disease short period time, ramp production neutralize antibodies detect virus again.

Those responses usually last years/decades/for life. Haha, suppose you‚Äôre right! that‚Äôs writers get ideas.  company companies  think EU, it? Didn‚Äôt watch that, trump ‚Äúgermaphobe‚Äù Jesus.

No, didn't. Shut I‚Äôm bating!!! vaccine literally reduce spread. what. is. the. point. I'm sure people downvoting instead trying help you. Let repost comment made months ago science stuff. 

TL;DR: get Pfizer Moderna, inject instructions (mRNA) creating spike protein cells. simple protein embedded wall virus lets immune system identify virus. cells create copies harmless protein, embed cell walls. immune system says, ""Wtf that, kill it"", kills cells makes antibodies recognize spike protein. exposed covid, immune system able respond immediately virus spread. Bad news people get shot, covid keeps spreading chances mutate. mutates enough, spike protein slowly becomes unrecognizable, rendering vaccine less effective. always create new vaccine new version spike protein, requires months testing, meantime virus could continue mutating.

mRNA vaccines amazing highly effective. theory, could use cure certain types cancers previously incurable. take sample cancer cells, make custom vaccine based specific proteins cancer cells contain, inject shot, immune system kills like cancer like fighting cold. chemo, radiation, surgery. They're also working vaccine malaria. mRNA technology amazing safe.

Original comment below:

Hey friend, research, concern definitely warranted. spike protein play part brain fog occurs ""long covid"". However, effect far potent presence full fledged coronavirus. Watch lecture attached around 21 minute mark. Basically, vast majority spike protein broken inside cell, chance escape. portion protein embedded membrane cell, allowing immune systen recognize make antibodies. cases, immune system may kill cell containing full spike protein, would indeed allow spike protein roam around bit. majority free proteins also going broken pretty quickly. Ultimately, spike proteins going make endothelial cells brain, cells many ACE2 receptors, spike proteins make far, basically effect damage. actually sick covid, virus tricked body making sooo many viral cells spike protein overwhelms blood brain barrier, even let full virus inside brain. seems cause brain fog. vaccine basically tiny dose effect - enough spikes train immune system, nowhere near enough spikes cause actual damage. relieved learn this,  ""Religion poisons mind"". religion. think people high anxiety may breath differently causing virus get lodged nose. also may clench chest, hyperventilate causing shortness breath.

Not lucky, design, touted feature vaccines companies scientists. Commander Chief work him. get board step side.   Yes. Read comment reply - saltywings completely wrong half Covid hospitalisations patients tested positive admission, leaked data reveal. 
The figures suggest vast numbers classed hospitalised Covid admitted ailments, virus picked routine testing. 
Experts said meant national statistics, published daily government website frequently referred ministers, may far overstate levels pressures NHS. 
The leaked data ‚Äì covering NHS trusts England ‚Äì show that, last Thursday, 44 per cent patients classed hospitalised Covid tested positive time admitted.  
The majority cases detected patients underwent standard Covid tests, carried everyone admitted hospital reason.  
Overall, 56 per cent Covid hospitalisations fell category, data, seen Telegraph, show.  
Crucially, group distinguish admitted severe illness, later found caused virus, hospital different reasons might otherwise never known picked up.  
Last month, health officials instructed NHS trusts provide ""a breakdown current stock Covid patients"", splitting hospital primarily virus reasons. far, NHS England failed publish data. 
However, patterns shown leaked figures ‚Äì vast majority hospital Covid cases diagnosed admission, cases weeks later ‚Äì suggest includes large numbers likely admitted reasons.  
The breakdown daily Covid hospital diagnoses shows 780 hospitalisations dated last Thursday, 44 per cent involved people tested positive 14 days hospital entry.  
A 43 per cent made within two days admission, 13 per cent made days weeks followed, including likely caught virus hospital. 
Experts said high number cases detected belatedly ‚Äì time PCR tests widely available ‚Äì suggested many patients admitted reasons.  
Prof Carl Heneghan, director Centre Evidence-Based Medicine University Oxford, said: ""This data incredibly important, published ongoing basis.  
""When people hear hospitalisations Covid, assume Covid likely cause, data shows something quite different ‚Äì Covid detected tests looking it."" 
Prof Heneghan urged Government publish clearer data, including whether virus primary cause hospital admission. 
""This needs fixed matter urgency,"" said, adding published data could lead public ""towards false conclusions"", exaggerating true levels pressures hospitals.  
Sir Graham Brady, chairman 1922 committee Tory MPs, said: ""Nearly 18 months Covid crisis, absurd data breaking hospital admissions still publicly available regular basis.  
""Counting patients test positive Covid hospitalisations inevitably misleading gives false picture continuing health impact virus."" 
Greg Clark, chairman Commons science technology select committee, Monday night said would write Sajid Javid, Health Secretary, asking publish breakdown regular basis following Telegraph's disclosure.  
""If hospitalisations Covid key determinant concerned be, quickly restrictions lifted, important data presented way could lead wrong conclusions drawn,"" said.  
""While people may admitted due Covid, currently know many. not, big distinction people admitted Covid something else Covid mild form cause hospitalisation.""  
The leaked statistics come NHS daily situation reports, collected hospital trusts England.  
One NHS data expert said published statistics distorted true picture, saying: ""It creates impression people going hospital Covid, simply case. People worried scared really understanding true picture ‚Äì find despicable."" 
An NHS spokesman said: ""Many patients admitted hospital Covid symptoms complications, confirmed post-admission Covid test, others may initially presymptomatic asymptomatic."" 
On Tuesday, NHS leaders said health service stretched height pandemic January made plea extra funding.  
In letter Prime Minister, Chancellor Health Secretary, NHS Providers, represents hospital trusts, raised fears situation could get worse gets better.  
They said ""very different pressures"" - including ""massive backlog"" patients need care, high numbers staff self-isolating annual leave, meant strain service bad start year. people know waiting full approval standard anti-vaxxers, spread anti-vax bullshit give shit getting vaccinated. still dumb seriously waiting full approval separate group ""non-vaccinated"" anti-vaxxers, experience. also wear masks public, socially distance, getting together groups. people know anti-vaxxers can't even assed put mask unless forced them. try understanding person, but........

How works instead producing virus specific antibodies attack virus may protect viruses - instead 'DRACO' substance waits body - within bodies cells perhaps - virus infects cell DRACO hijacks virus soon enters cell rewires part virus destroy said infected cell. Virus infects cell, injects virus code cell - DRACO attaches self destruct code onto virus infection code - cell reads virus code see's self destruct code cell thus self destructs. substance designed specifically detect whether infection happens. 
 
So means like substance probably protect flu virus, COVID 19.. Common cold.. Etc.. 
 
Though substance maybe antiviral actual vaccine - still could last maybe actually make DRACO actual vaccine somehow getting body produce DRACO itself. 
 
Here news article it: 
  shouldn‚Äôt speaking absolutes he‚Äôs national stage speaking nations leader. I‚Äôm attempting say OP saying using platform push vaccine misinformation, shouldn‚Äôt looking much farther politicians, includes sitting President. wants/will need IVF, sees money investment thing (like got it, lowered fertility, paid money IVF didnt work) country whole fucking world goverments part lmao Would anyone articles, sources, insight transmission vaccinated people? Wrong. lol yes course somehow sound crazy you? don‚Äôt want unvaccinated malcontents entering state nobody else either. 

People crying loss ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù already need ID everywhere go, enhanced ID cross state lines passport enter countries. 

And, antivax people would know this, also need vaccinations go college. 

It‚Äôs new. Completely anecdotal, but, I've twice kicked ass day-a day half, times. easier deal second time around.

I hope is, **majority** people, experience. cool, dude! think people looking reason dismiss bad news.

This study New England Journal Medicine. includes methods section, obviously. plenty posters thread even seem read linked newspaper article, much less actual study. source information?  Everything read recently suggests delta deadly alpha original strains deadly... sub seems slowly reverting Fall 2020 bad news past 2-3 weeks. specific threshold: &lt; 50 cases per 100K people per day, &lt; 8% positive testing rate. county threshold, masks longer need worn public settings.

This may new semi-permanent reality. wave (presumably) peak fall point. county gets threshold, go back normal, repeat necessary future waves come go.

If masks need control thing foreseeable future, that's still pretty good win. I'm pretty sure that's exactly study authors suggesting (as counterpoint hypothesis specific cross-reactivity emerging data epigenetic metabolic reprogramming innate immune cells suggests exposure second, non-specific stimulus could trigger targeted heightened proinflammatory response.21,22 ‚Äúheterologous immunity‚Äù could explain nonspecific cross-reactivity vaccines unrelated pathogens.  3 day safe? LMFAO think means cloth surgical masks. worked reducing viral load, basically. So, yeah, stands reason they‚Äôd lose points effectiveness variant produces higher viral load. I‚Äôm failing see headline worthy, isn‚Äôt widely known young people hospitalized even dying covid? would assume tragic cases like country. Americans wondering difference, UK significant party holding antivax position. government opposition parties united pro vaccine stance, giving little political space anti-vaxxers operate. Even wingnuts British conservative party surely told toe party line absolutely finished. Nows time get Novavax door. many us hesitant take Pfizer/Moderna/J&amp;J one reason another waiting novavax. Get going! Altruism part Oxford though. could shared profits. would politely request question data collection country. nation look away record breakthrough transmissions, ‚Äúpandemic unvaccinated‚Äù. Every country reporting around. 60/40 split, vaccinated people 60% people infected hospitalized. sole country coming saying 80%+ efficacy people vaccinated January Israel reporting what, 39% efficacy 7 months? I‚Äôm 99% sure 39% accurate top head remembering study performed, astoundingly less. think it‚Äôs highly disingenuous country recording data ‚Äúbreakthrough‚Äù cases directly correlates vaccine efficacy plus part shaping peoples opinions decisions wether get vaccinated not. mental break something stupid. Makes glad friends family vaccinated. I‚Äôm naive, really thought basically. Masks stopped mandated one month everything normal again. happened ever end?? probably sell cute Disney Princess masks think sooner everyone accepts we‚Äôre going catch this

Wrong. CDC Director said 1-2 20 breakthrough cases. 90-95% vaccinated never get infected. new guideline still protecting unvaccinated. still pandemic unvaccinated. Maybe Ireland lucky make vaccines poltical. Probably fully vaccinated virus far better defenses virus. Nobody said zero risk.

But skeptical. obtuse. 1 million risk blood clot versus risk COVID (even teenagers) well reducing spread obvious risk assessment point idiot recognize it.

Of course, people I've talked seem opinion 1 million risk less acceptable 2 100 risk (their numbers words, mine) It‚Äôs actually Italian saying, guy‚Äôs creation. Reading insane thoughts former friends social media doesn‚Äôt move towards goals. gave stuff years ago life peaceful  Literally CDC always said unsafe kids 2 wear them. recently turned 2. wouldn‚Äôt much time get used anyway, sounds like perhaps never met toddler before. I‚Äôve wear short outings whole day daycare quite another matter. becoming immune day stories unvaccinated people fighting lives. numb. want vaccines continue effective, think cdc needs set system similar flu vaccine Pfizer, moderna jnj release new version vaccine every year account new variants mutations anti vax crowd UK drowned anti covid passport crowd, antivaxxers small UK. crossover course too. guess teh patients overtook asylum finally. Sad. damn frustrating. I'm vaccine specialist maybe there's something I'm aware of, whole fertility angle seems invented thin air anti-vaxxers. understand gained much traction.

Back reality, know doctor (a) gotten vaccine, (b) subsequently gotten pregnant. particular doctor -- one wife's good friends -- history fertility trouble level difficulty time past.

In words, based one data point know, vaccine made difference fertility.  GOING DIE FACE HOLES COVERED? SEEM FULL PANIC ATTACK IT. watching pro-vaxx vs anti-vaxx spew misinformation back forth one another like they're immunologists..

90% clue talking about. reminds story ...

A guy rooftop neighborhood flooded water rising quickly.  prays prays God save him. praying guy boat paddles tells man roof room him.
The man roof replies, ""NO, faith God, God save me."" returns praying. boat paddles off. 


The flooding gets lot higher. water rushing faster, man prays harder.


As water reaches rooftop, helicopter flies overhead, voice microphone tells man going send rope ladder fly safety. 


The praying man refuses helicopter says, ""No thank you, man faith. God save me.""


10 minutes later flood overtakes roof praying man's lungs fill turbulent water asks God: ""God, devout life, save me?!?""


God replies, "" sent boat helicopter, else expect do?"" go house car, non-zero risk car's gas tank spontaneously explodes. stop using cars harass people using cars well?

 


Technically 0.0001% non-zero, mean statistically significant. Well, shit. bad. Protip: want get vaccine want anyone know, walk pharmacy get one without identifying providing insurance info. They'll *ask* info, simply decline answer they'll still give shot government still pay time. make sure keep track vaccine card get second shot, since record. yeah I‚Äôm aware, vaccines still super important. Oh no, mask slowly suffocating death?!?!??!? 

You must report back. seem devastated! Sir, Wendy's appears falling apart. even waste anymore time teh infrastructure theater. one said vaccines 100% effective. everyone getting important protect small amount breakthroughs prevent new variants taking hold. Yeah, lot youth UK complained LOT wait longer others vaccine. really difference countries here, silly comparison. people Missouri getting vaccinated Covid-19 secret fear backlash ~~loved~~ ones oppose vaccines, doctor says

corrected but‚Ä¶ ~~51~~ 5Gs! data ""published imminently,"" according federal official knowledgeable research authorized spokesperson government. speculation, though, based observations experience. course quantitative data ideal. reliable sample size. mom one :( Vaccine shedding thing, it‚Äôs something happens unless it‚Äôs live-attenuated vaccine even it‚Äôs incredibly rare. believe oral polio vaccine issue it‚Äôs used anymore United States. vaccines Covid type it‚Äôs issue. 

Viral shredding issue catch Covid, however. doubt it. barely got masks enforced first time around. We're currently 88.4% adults (over 18) least one dose. exclude people ineligible due health reasons it'd maybe 90%, know kind data available.

Source: We‚Äôve reached end list. 18s offered first vaccine. I‚Äôm 30s second jab couple weeks ago. ran $2000 checks election it. gonna now. Tbh I‚Äôd rather place shutdown government daycare force mask 2 year old said screw never put mask them? somehow fault someone else? homeopathic co-worker. odd - object wearing mask, acknowledges covid-19 real, antivax.

We're like month away forced vaccination requirements well - interesting. think strike balance, closing schools was, empirically, effective suppressive measure US think need mandate vaccines get kids back school, given many people killed US, it‚Äôs hard argue wasn‚Äôt correct decision. could‚Äôve easily million deaths point. Everyone 18 + anyone 18 vulnerable lives someone vulnerable. Yeah, state told same! I'm exposed work time....I can't believe CDC forgot mention lol. stupid people live state. Delta bounce northeast US decrease comparable manner next 3 weeks. Probably can‚Äôt say MO, LA etc.  Would okay ask doctor administer COVID swab butt?

Like China. comfortable shoving things ass. shove suppositories, enemas, fingers, etc, butt daily. Would okay ask doctor instead nose? imagine teachers would stay home 1: demanding job easy bit tired headache 2: would want sure side-effects covid. mean side-effects severe though, received leaflet shot noting around 10% get flu like symptoms around 30% muscle soreness. Well yea lol. 200 employees one point asking positive asymptotic come work! Haha funnily enough, time everyone metro mask mandates, found least respectful areas (in terms following mandate) outskirts metro. go small towns right now, except last year went Marceline Disney Museum (they required masks). Read full info, recommending masks certain vaccinated people. vaccinated people. Primarily immunocompromised. Also vaccinated people overwhelming hospitals, unvaccinated are. 

Also back time, Delta Variant spread (primarily unvaccinated people). 

So exact wording necessarily correct, prevent catching severe case covid transmission covid vaccinated people still minimal. protect unvaccinated immunocompromised. 

Again, read, correct I'm wrong missing something. 

Meanwhile, guy actively spreading lies vaccine stuff like that, bit different. knows spouting bullshit remain popular certain group people. 

TL;DR: Biden worded poorly information actively trying spread lies, guy complaining actively spreading lies political gain. ideas:

* Send 2 batches $1,000 checks. check tied vaccine shot. 
* Add hard deadline check. example, gotten first shot September 1st eligible first check. 2nd shot administered November 1st eligible 2nd check. 
* Anyone already received vaccine eligible, everyone gets stimmy checks time. 
* People valid medical reasons (allergic shot, immune compromised individuals, etc) still eligible, signed form doctor. ‚ÄúPhilosophical reasons‚Äù don‚Äôt count. 

Those want make choice thumb nose cure still free so. aren‚Äôt eligible stimmy checks.  idea link see, breakdown: link seem work mobile view, change desktop view possible. 

Pfizer/BioNTech much popular originally predicted, although AZ still common. Delta crazy. read story traced \~200 person super spread event club back 1 person infecting people. Boos don‚Äôt block shots
-Kobe Bryant Explains perfectly. getting HPV shot offered covid shot too. I‚Äôll pass see long term human studies side effects. 100% agreed.

I keep saying thing..the unvaccinated already downplayed COVID delta variant. add CDC reinforcing mask mandates saying vaccinated still transmit disease? Zero incentive them. Didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd back am. hoping stuff looking forward doesn‚Äôt get cancelled.  Word. great argument I'm tucking back pocket. eligible group currently? 1% epically huge fucking number guy. Finally Biden caught idea rectangular green Benjamin Franklin Health Certificates vaccinated

Also, song this, Yes, Exactly. People completely ignoring fact Neutralizing Vaccines, Sterilizing Vaccines, implies breakthroughs would happen. new found info. it, obviously spread it. question robust person's immune system is, blocks virus replication body quick enough prevent propagation community. also immunocompromised individuals still need careful even vaccinated.

You're right prematurely lifted mask mandates knowing well enough anti-vaxxers budge idiocy, would cause another surge. surge also proved many Americans actually lack integrity. bad can‚Äôt give literal millions vaccines west throw trash.  It‚Äôs hard believe many vaxxed Covid already we‚Äôre close herd immunity. Approved flair change emphasize figures England. assumed meant worldwide thought sounded extremely low!    slice Costco sausage pizza. Dad says, ""Hi"", btw.

I told fine delicious. Half country cult? Thats people

Im american citizen dont vote Dude, cut trees parks ran wood funeral pyres masses bodies floating buried banks river. I‚Äôm sure media blow something everyone saw eyes. would say give power courts already mind thing make judgements on. want wear mask wear mask. assume least little safer wearing mask not. Well fairness....it matters little. longer orange despot Napoleonic complex running show telling us drink bleach/get sun lungs. Reddit loves anecdotes.

Pretty much everyone loves anecdotes. should, yes interested: fatality rate Ebola pretty inversely proportional size outbreak, decreased quite bit time. big 2014 one like \~33% fatal (IIRC), considerably lower 90% figure people typically cite original 1976 outbreak. Yeah rules seem kind stupid...

Here wear mask walk table, even restaurant empty, take soon get table, even there's another table right next you. basing reality? prediction future. say per people still needing masks.if vaccinated still catching vaccines work. natural immunity works. /s Beyond vaccines getting covid need track many get naturally second time. follow CDC guidelines mask wearing isn‚Äôt going stop mutations.

This world lot bigger local mask ordinance. mutations happen it‚Äôs much likely result poorer countries don‚Äôt privilege mass vaccinations.  understanding lie get one. 
Sign vaccine nearby clinic administering vaccines, say ""No"" ask got vaccine before. 

We actually centralized database tracking vaccinated, make area's vaccination uptakw look extra good, way knowing something wrong! 

I guess probably no-show second dose Pfizer then.  Tldr.... dont know

And would we. Covid19 around year. wont know increase shit like alzheimers long time.

Also. Nbc news allowed post fluf pieces here? ok option US?? guys wild. pointing people shoulder shoulder festivals nothing new exclusive Lolla it‚Äôs going necessarily ‚Äúend badly‚Äù especially outdoors new regulations around vaccinations. sounds like confused addled. responsibility something makes feel better. 

do quote i've said anything responsibility get vaccinated. 

here, let quote actually said free thing, fam. hope human decency wear mask public infection vector people unable get vaccine even want arguing free make choice simultaneously refusing protect others ramifications behavior, acting disgustingly selfish.

you're fabricating false statement, never made, argue it. contend vaccine automatically makes world safe Covid,

you're continuing fabricate false statements argue them. medical science always stated better immune system build antibodies.

you're making another false equivalence. health well depend upon others, convinced does

this health, idiot. 

that's selfish fools never get head around. 

&amp;nbsp;

i comment rest moronic drivel.

*other* reiterate, selfish morons like partially blame 600k american deaths covid, absolutely blame everyone else US suffer continuing surges covid. Would relevant comment headline mentioned 60,005 something. know mean giving rounded number. na OMEGALUL recent shitshow big changes they're saying want data seem actually organized show even people like Chise Twitter extremely patient explaining everything giving benefit doubt snapping them

It's total shitshow they're basically gift-wrapping ammo Covid deniers conspiracies using exert control a: going monthly booster shot, entire side conversation pretty much moot. said,

b: monthly booster shot going put people commission similarly initial covid vaccine shots did, no, reasonable expect people go every month. (I talking specifically people strong reaction; know everyone did. didn't.) ""think children!"" ability take much time work, people look kids recovering, etc., etc. Alas, shown data, LA 50 year olds driving surge, 18 29. 7-day case rate residents **18 29 July 15, 2021 24 per 100,000** ‚Äî see chart below. Among **50-64 years old case rate 7.76 per 100,000**

24/100k much larger 8/100k. careful still vote. cult strong. CDC political organization take everything say grain salt. agree corporate America comes employees turn zombies

well that's new one, heard theory omfg lost there. DARE CONFORM DELUSIONS Nope. care less long plague rats anymore. imagine co-evolution hosts included umbrella lay people would call viral evolution. Regardless, analogy bad one. Co-evolution like requires \*extensive\* history two organisms, maybe think SARS-CoV-2 way thousand years. Yeah know ""I felt awful 36 hours"" considered ""not easy deal second time around"", sir need perspective goddamn. would still excellent return investment ended us getting 200m fully vaxxed individuals. people can't understand that, they're dense. dense people get vaccinated still pretty damn dense. Yup.

I‚Äôm done playing along. Time get back normal. CDC idea they‚Äôre anymore. Saskatchewan Alberta, two provinces Canada lowest vaccination rates dropped health restrictions including masks, isolating positive etc. stopping testing outside hospitals clinics coming weeks reporting covid stats.

School happening masks, distancing, encouraging little ones practice good hand hygiene etc. 

Our Health Minister gonads say everyone wants vaccine one now. father two kids 12, disagree. 

I know people sick this, would nice keep precautions place 4th wave starting here. health insurance country, insurance companies deny insurance similar reasons? principled foolish. Whatever gets people vaccinated need do. return dwarf investment.

The reward getting vaccine got (and free) peace mind able resume significantly normal activities, especially since live NYC.

Many least vaccinated places impoverished education typically strong. throwing people $100 ups vaccine percentage 10 points, would overwhelming success. much lesser degree. importantly, vast majority people vaccinated, risk drops exponentially.

That's point. Vaccination kind team effort. people refuse participate, kick asses team. That's need pushing, rather rewarding them. way parts world look UK sign things come, look Scotland sign things come rest UK.

It's encouraging see cases continue decline. people quitting, issue, wage issues overly complicated hiring processes. wonder anyone anywhere could ever fired laid off? sort masochist telling someone go environment, almost chance finding anyone replace rate. I'd assume better luck finding gold backyard replacing administrative assistant year. even that. 4 BILLION vaccine doses given point, unheard vaccine trial history. Hi, article outdated. Next time I'll delay getting vaccine get bribed to. Thanks Biden! We‚Äôre pretty well overall bc (81% 12+ first dose, 63% second dose). Province-wide average doesn‚Äôt always tell story well; areas well 80% considerably lower.

 small frustrating pockets lower rates‚Ä¶ communities/pockets people decided ‚Äúdone covid‚Äù ALSO didn‚Äôt bother getting vaccinated, sigh  Can't wait bosses completely ignore still make staff come even we've exposed. Woo. Huh. TIL.  I'm wondering 16-19 rates increase fall schools start in-house vaccination drives.

*Definitely.* What's consensus masks now? remember kept flip-flopping effective not, ever come conclusion effective reducing transmission?

I like wearing mask Tbh, wondering protective are? I'd recommend looking following charts:

- [Cases heatmap

- [Vaccinations heatmap

Cases disproportionately skewing towards younger age ranges compared previous waves; vaccinations correlated older age ranges.

It's fair say vaccines work. decides misinformation is?

When pandemic started, telling people wear mask would disinformation even mask mandates right now? Serious question. CDC say naturally infected people get vaccinated anyway? Yep, scary. I'm AR things going bad worse dire HOURS, weeks, now. 

HHS deploying surge teams state assist managing hospitals. think may full-blown humanitarian disaster soon. hard make decisions I'm given clear consistent information base them. Finally, President call school districts nationwide host least one pop-up vaccination clinic coming weeks ‚Äúin effort get kids 12 older vaccinated.‚Äù

Hopefully along Pfizer's possible upcoming approval 5-11 could make CDC recommending masks schools longer necessary coming months. could getting overly optimistic.  use Facebook can't misinformed. anything else imagine, pretty much.

This. really know enough barely speculate. many unknowns nail stuff down. 
 
But I'm willing predict whatever happens, happen US unevenly - differently states handling things, different populations people within states responding, too.  
 
All bets off. thing I'll bet chaos. sounds like confused addled. responsibility something makes feel better. contend vaccine automatically makes world safe Covid, medical science always stated better immune system build antibodies. 

Also, stuck another mental hurdle appears great clear - ONE science. Science, nature discussion open testing discourse. assume echo chamber ‚Äúwe infection/survival rate people don‚Äôt wear masks take vaccines‚Äù facile divisive. health well depend upon others, convinced - course angry afraid. It‚Äôs happy swallow media government lies. 

Fauci involved directly funding function Wuhan. 

This virus came Wuhan lab leak military release - nobody knows admit yet. 

A virus doesn‚Äôt mutate get stronger told Delta variant is. virus gets weaker mutates keep host alive. 

Masks.Do.Not.Protect Covid certainly wearing mask day, every day. Definitely touch mask hands. 

I‚Äôm sure country hail stranger, understand living Communist dictatorship (similar you‚Äôre seeing Government lately) willing comply government need think rationally government protect you. US, FREE citizens. One day you‚Äôll understand freedom choice have. happened county. Especially since local elections fall. afraid thst vocal minority, lose votes sane minded people. Also enough money virtual. Jesus Christ...

I thought decided vaccines worked 50 years ago. Im MO, complete shitshow. majority people Japan supported cancelling Olympics. government respect people, people may pay price. hope everything pulls Japan. Isn‚Äôt covid ü§î believe what's going happen, that's bad thing. I‚Äôm unclear $100 incentives coming from. federal govt providing funding, they‚Äôre telling localities think it‚Äôs good idea? don‚Äôt see whole lot traction it‚Äôs latter.

Im whatever gets people vaccinated fwiw. in: water wet.  know people state Neither censorship fever, body aches, 0 energy one day. felt like flu, one day, really big deal intense side side effects anyone know. Slept felt 100% next day. People literally worse children comes sick all. Ultimately, basic liberty really? one you‚Äôre allowed plan execute strategies people die? still wave flag libel slander laws exist, survive able knowingly spew dangerous disinformation public health emergencies. Come on. It‚Äôs blatantly clear harmful easy measure harm case. It‚Äôs like can‚Äôt trace anti-vax messaging ultimate conclusions. airlines-I suspect tsunami effect. Airlines, cruise ships, casinos, upscale restaraunts, gyms, theatres etc. People saying Delta peaks 6 weeks.

FL 3-4 weeks Delta spike.

So 6 weeks theory true, cases start come mid-August. Although [Lee seems week ahead that.

So end August, shouldnt seeing eye-popping numbers now.

I guess fine. Really, first result googled (written Associated Press) pretty clearly states says positive PCR test vaccinated individual breakthrough case. would implicitly include asymptomatics: enough people gotten vaccinated disease wouldn‚Äôt spread enough mutate. people refused get vaccinated mutations spread. Mutations resistant vaccines.

The science hasn‚Äôt wrong. They‚Äôve always stated need high vaccination numbers wipe out.  you‚Äôre curious, here‚Äôs link CIDRAP/Osterholm podcast quote recall hearing (this Summer 2020, speaking time Delta variant, sure would change anything said time)?

In short, looking epidemiologists provide numbers risk acceptable. I‚Äôm interested hearing lay people politicians ‚Äúthink‚Äù ‚Äúfeel.‚Äù want experts help define things us &amp; I‚Äôll put faith would say basically 5 cases less per 100,000 population, decreasing numbers cases past 14 days, hospitals least 25% extra capacity handle cases, think talking reopening, knowing still going challenge, numbers would use, heard school superintendents, wish somebody would give number, least could go meeting, that, I'm going throw out. 5 cases per 100,000 population less per day, 14 days decreasing numbers new cases, least quarter hospital beds available surge need address it. think potentially place looking go forward. So, let conclude saying give answers probably already know.‚Äù Think like this:
100 people, 70 vaccinated 30 vaccinated.

10 people end hospitalized. 40% vaccinated, that's 4 people. 6 vaccinated.

That 40% 4 70 people. Whereas 60% unvaccinated 6 30 people. Genuinely curious.....how/where get third shot, recommended you?

I proud owner two Moderna shots.....but administered Jan/Feb I'm seriously contemplating attempting secure first dose Pfizer somewhere soon.  Read maybe Britain reached immunity threshold. 70 percent adults fully vaccinated, 88 percent first dose ‚Äî one best vaccine uptakes world. Among remain unvaccinated, many covid asymptomatic could approaching ‚Äúpopulation immunity, people immune either vaccinations natural infection,‚Äù said Paul Hunter, professor medicine University East Anglia. surprised LEO union opposition, given ideological weltanschauung. 

IMO Fed, ideologically would anti-vax often bemoaning government abuse yet personify work. hopefully clear deadwood Federal service. parents (65+) vacation planned Florida (Sanibel area) end August. They'll need fly there. vaccinated, though. Bad idea? whose company number well-known restaurants New York City Washington, said policy would extend Shake Shack franchise would implement policy

Apparently sounds like going something. wait see Honestly, best decision could made. regret decades sooner. thank you. wouldn‚Äôt surprised large communities people anti-vax everyone thinks everyone else wants anti-vax. Like they‚Äôre faking sake ‚Äúfitting in‚Äù, everyone honest they‚Äôd realize one actually wants anti-vax anymore. Novavax protein subunit vaccine used previous vaccines including HPV vaccine US.

EUA Emergency Use Authorization, ""approval"" given three vaccines use US. Unless side effects severe needing hospitalized say counts. side effect -- arm hurt days. guess -- worry intubated hospital high-contagion ward. There's sliver population secretly want vaccine sunken cost fallacy trap benchmark say, ""Ok, well approved, finally that's I've waited for, much ask? suckers go early need boosters."" what's that, like 5%? something. 12 approved happen. 

If parents holding vaccinating themselves, force kids vaccinated school feel like help encourage get it. 

Once 12s approved we'll see nice jump, kids adults. It‚Äôs also worse vaccine probably cost lot less terms R don‚Äôt blame them, blame government officials experts horrible public health messaging underselling vaccines. Especially CDC director says nonsense like ‚Äúwe mutations away vaccines working‚Äù. hell would get vaccinated then?

The vaccines work perfectly, look who‚Äôs getting sick hospitalized. though? unvaccinated exactly rush start getting shots. masking delay inevitable. point unlikely hospitals overwhelmed areas low vax uptake, good luck getting people wear masks anyway. fly, cross state lines. totally different things... dont go cities bud dont worry it. Please punish service workers (understandable) noncompliance. choice jobs. get wrong, I'm excited move, time vaccination rates making eer side caution. What's people sub insisting kids 12 never opportunity get vaxxed? whenever there's article kids getting severely ill dying response is, ""there worse things there."" Tell grieving parents. people hate kids, like logic here? yea I‚Äôm speaking towards daily life. Nightlife masks naturally don‚Äôt mix doubt mandates enforced department business owners Obviously 0. 100+ hospitalized per million sustainable, whether vaccinated not, matter much we'd like unvaccinated personally responsible, levels everyone's healthcare start suffer. US 90/M still upward trajectory. get idea CDC said vaccines work? propaganda Fox News comment. Reported mods hopefully immediately banned. ""Thank letting know feel wearing mask improperly""

Moron. can't control Russia, ex-soviet bloc states, Africa, etc do. vaccination rates abysmal, way worse ours. 

The virus bound mutate matter US. Time move life get boosters needed. Fuck restrictions, time let people decide much risk want take. article doesn‚Äôt say that. ‚ÄúThe science‚Äù pretty consistent getting vaccine anyway. don‚Äôt know long natural antibodies last, what‚Äôs harm extra cautious? CDC never said vaccines don‚Äôt work new variants. Amazon software engineers/engineers America make much Europeans. Yeah, although notes Delta variant, since data goes March. obviously lower 84% delta. work handful people outright refuse get shot. Pisses people choose get 'don't want to'.

The two closest 30's health. Another maybe early 50's healthy. they‚Äôre part announcement, right? restaurants fall restaurant group? shame ‚Ä¶ could start nice trend fast casual places like Shake Shack Chipotle started mandating it. might help afraid get mRNA shots. slightest amount research answer questions you. fact demanding people research suggests actually interested learning, arguing. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Good luck baby goals! Victimhood fuel, rabbit hole, identity wrapped anti-vax. 
But eventually, people need jobs. Eventually, like seatbelt law, people's attention move blend norms...(but that's government wants üò≥ /s)  Small town MO (about equally far St. Louis KC gives idea), regularly person grocery store picking food one restaurants mask generally get looked like I'm alien. I'll gladly share vaccination status, definitely get judged it. CDC said live Shaw area. Outside restaurants public spaces go see people wearing masks. mainly grocery store shops Georgia Ave 14th street. feel like gym restaurant would spaces mask would hindrance cathedral tend conservative minds.

Yeah, comparing last year doesn‚Äôt totally
Connect ‚Äî vaccines different virus CDC bumbled bit, honest, least they're trying protect lives. 

Anti-vaxxers bioterrorists. Right, suspected, trust FDA regardless. Anyone agree misinformed preconceived notions loses credibility. Meanwhile real world, universities adhere CDC guidelines perfectly within rights mandate FDA approved vaccines. also perfectly within rights find private university feel still credibility. wish luck endeavor. Shake Shack's Chairman ‚ÄúDo research‚Äù I‚Äôm masking up, don‚Äôt trust science behind vaccines, it‚Äôs way early say it‚Äôs working. Yes cases also half planet population hiding home cases dropping Honest question, really want fight it. blame non-vaccinated CDC gas already said vaccine work new variants. complied part last year NOTHING changed. see vaccine effects anything. people got covid vaccine get annual flu shot they're still making mandates lol especially regards nightlife Something read morning said requiring vaccinations government employees, Cuomo Biden given cover every organization wants same. longer make national headlines do. cross fingers new wave + many peer universities requiring vaccines allows them/pushes same. case another stimulus virus mutates around current vaccines healthcare system overwhelmed. Another stay-at-home order sounds impossible bringing back masks.

I want another stimulus. amount money inefficiently thrown issues recently insane. America needs sorts spending social infrastructure healthcare, form money everyone, including hundreds millions need all.  Here's theory: outside major gathering holidays events, people generally know protect themselves. constant things mix households indoors, virus spreads easiest. Things like holidays, sporting teams well, etc bring multiple households together often normal day-to-day life. theory spread happens there, get month long surge due event, numbers rise, people become little careful: stop seeing friends family much. virus harder time spreading R drops 1 due less interactions people. another major holiday/event happens get bump cases.

A higher baseline cases + gathering event holiday = spike cases.

For US, makes increasingly worried near Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas. Bettter union know #ibew Looks like cruise line passengers everything correctly. Everyone onboard vaccinated. cases asymptomatic, kept isolated caution could disembark.  


In one sense, ""nothing happened"" -- lot happened ensure safety, worth read. Lots ""zero-covid"" people realizing thats going thing freaking acceptance phase hospitals report numbers based internal info. state reports numbers based death certificates, state numbers report deaths quickly hospitals do. state also reports cases deaths date occur, means looking numbers July 25th (for example) may see number increase tomorrow compared number today. That's data filters state, increase number deaths occurred July 25th. Ding ding ding! answer! people even know exposed? It‚Äôs like contact tracing robust enough keep current level spread.  people upset probably also getting vaccinated without telling anyone. Hope feel better soon. Yup, 100%. People blaming CDC Fauci, complaining ""messaging"" playing exact game. guess I‚Äôll take opportunity point aren‚Äôt public health official, don‚Äôt know you‚Äôre talking about, maybe ask please grow fuck slightly inconvenience yourself. 

I‚Äôll wrap acknowledging hardship, pointing there‚Äôs pandemic going on, reminding everyone get vaccinated, telling want continue conversation, ‚Äúthanks thanks‚Äù. Nobody cares!!!!!!!! MEDIA WANTS US DIVIDED.. TURN TV LIVE LIFE... India felt close pandemic‚Äôs beginning was. 
Except happened third time. say triggered mass extinction event Natural selection it‚Äôs finest! require vaccinations, they're asking vaccinated upload health records :/ Also, people stop getting tested. Hospitalizations weeks let us know.  final July 11th according article cases peaked July 17th. final superspreader event driving peak peak occurred later? 17 days, fucking hear both. bachelor party weekend several things altered low-key. point, we're deep cancel anything. Fingers crossed fiance avoid sort infection able attend wedding honeymoon issues. 

I wish both. We'll get this! Go daily thread. That's pro-plague trolls thrive.

Their gameplan make sure anger pandemic's resurgence aimed CDC, anti-vaxxers (where properly belongs). admittedly quite cautious related pandemic.

How works instead producing virus specific antibodies attack virus may protect viruses - instead 'DRACO' substance waits body - within bodies cells perhaps - virus infects cell DRACO hijacks virus soon enters cell rewires part virus destroy said infected cell. Virus infects cell, injects virus code cell - DRACO attaches self destruct code onto virus infection code - cell reads virus code see's self destruct code cell thus self destructs. substance designed specifically detect whether infection happens. 
 
So means like substance probably protect flu virus, COVID 19.. Common cold.. Etc.. 
 
Though substance maybe antiviral actual vaccine - still could last maybe actually make DRACO actual vaccine somehow getting body produce DRACO itself. 
 
Here news article it: 
  
 
Also 90 Survival rate mean virus leaves body undamaged. 
 
The virus causing permanent damage body - stuff like brain damage, lung scarring - make lungs like smoker lungs. 
 
And furthermore get infected - maybe later bodies antibodies wear vaccine wears get reinfected - maybe infected mutated variant meaning body gets even permanent damage dealt body. reinfection making body worse time - maybe lowering survival rate time maybe exponentially. b.1.621 variant isn‚Äôt anything new worry about. far tell, doesn‚Äôt severe symptoms variant, vaccines still effective it. doesn‚Äôt make right.

Taipei, July 29 (CNA) Taiwan Thursday reported 18 new COVID-19 cases -- 16 transmitted domestically two contracted overseas -- zero deaths disease second consecutive day, according Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC).

Of domestic cases, seven reported New Taipei, five Taipei, two Kaohsiung one Taoyuan Chiayi, Minister Health Welfare Chen Shih-chung (Èô≥ÊôÇ‰∏≠) said CECC press briefing.

Fourteen cases people tested positive quarantine, listed contact COVID-19 case, Chen said, source infection two cases still investigation.

The number new cases recently hovered around 20 expected continue fall, unless new cluster occurs, Chen said.

The new imported cases, meanwhile, involved two Taiwanese nationals recently returned Taiwan United States Cambodia, according CECC.

To date, Taiwan confirmed total 15,637 COVID-19 cases, 14,158 domestically transmitted infections reported since May 15, country first recorded 100 cases single day since beginning pandemic.

With deaths reported two days, number confirmed COVID-19 deaths country remains 787, 12 recorded since May 15, CECC data showed.

Around 7.27 million people Taiwan received first COVID-19 vaccine shot, translates nearly 31 percent population, 315,601 people, 1.3 percent, received two doses needed fully vaccinated, according CECC.

Speaking press briefing Thursday, CECC spokesperson Chuang Jen-hsiang (Ëéä‰∫∫Á••) said July 21, CECC received 13 reports people diagnosed thrombosis combination thrombocytopenia (TTS) getting AstraZeneca vaccine shot.

TTS, rare disorder blood clots combined low platelet levels, reported patients aged 22-80, four 27 days got AstraZeneca jab, Chuang said.

This equivalent reported rate 4.2 cases per million doses administered Taiwan, Chuang said, adding disorder commonly reported among younger patients.

In Europe, rate TTS 10-20 cases per million doses administered, said.

The CECC advises people experience following symptoms within 4-28 days getting AstraZeneca shot see doctor immediately: persistent headaches, blurred vision, persistent abdominal pain, swelling pain one's legs, severe chest pain difficulty breathing.

A World Health Organization report released earlier month said ""plausible causal link"" TTS AstraZeneca vaccine, scientists still unsure mechanisms involved.

(By Chiang Yi-ching) didnt tolerate loss first time around got completely fucked. difference going make Corporate America get Sure can. case, mandates county/city employees. States could mandate vaccinations wanted to.  dangerous. aforementioned reasons, ESPECIALLY keeping vaccine status secret fuel unvaccinated fire.

The article doesn‚Äôt give us good idea frequently actually happening. large enough percentage people get secretly vaxxed, see becoming false evidence unvaxxed stay unvaxxed. 

‚ÄúNo one immediate circle vaccinated fine.‚Äù

Or, likely, bigger threat:

‚ÄúSo got COVID fine days.‚Äù Thousands people died it? Seriously?

How sources that? Strep throat .3% chance causing rheumatic fever untreated, outcome longitudinal lasting effect quality life, it‚Äôs considered critical take step prevent treating antibiotics immediately.

I‚Äôd apply logic here. still don‚Äôt reliable treatment, it‚Äôs reasonable concerned this. I've West Plains, MO. makes sense live there. Rural SW MO conformity, deviate face social backlash. grew outside Springfield, I'm glad kids growing there. sister one MO got vaccinated secret. She‚Äôs teacher, got district wide vaccination event. husband one people thinks microchips even flu vaccine. 25 year old son thinks way. myself, sister, mother daughter know. I'm obtuse, I've fully vaccinated since April. I'm telling people skeptical hesitant, push away vaccinated. see LOT comments sub push people away.

Your reaction exactly people skeptical get vaccine. need frame argument terms risk/reward, let make choice. Frame terms why.

A skeptical friend told ""I going get read heart issues"" replied ""Yes that's true, risk group. talk doctor, rare treatable would happen. doubt would happen, though. tell watch worried. Personally, I'd get vaccinated.""

Guess what? got vaccinated. taken tact, probably have.

That's valuable lesson communicating people hesitant. valid concerns eyes, need belittlement. Mask mandates effectively shutdown huge swaths economy. social gatherings events places already canceled.  forgot :/ It‚Äôs athletes. It‚Äôs unvaccinated Japanese. US families option free vaccine age 12 up. don‚Äôt want vaccine don‚Äôt want wear mask, that‚Äôs choice.

Japanese people infected Olympics don‚Äôt choice get vaccine. Even masking Japanese people involved games getting infected. I'd say time find new friends ditch toxic family members oppose vaccines. nephew 8. released Arkansas Children's spending 2 days Covid. stable got go home needed bed. Covid dealing there. Many kids sick RSV. everyone dropped precautions kids started circulating like usual winter viruses hit once. schools prohibited law requiring masks vaccines. School opens soon. 

Meanwhile, adult covid patients crushing Healthcare system. hospitals beds. county 3 ambulances. busy 24/7 covid patients. 27% county age 65. Two people drove hospital heart attacks week know of. We've told transfers neighboring states longer option need care wait hours seen ER. days bed. 

It's disaster here. old Ancient Greek saying : hit listen say first . countries including guidance advising vaccinating children . Clearly , cnn engaging propaganda piece frighten others . usa , may public policy include children rarely it‚Äôs done elsewhere (yet) . People live different countries , CDC equivalents , shouldn‚Äôt silencing Reddit usa different policy . hasn‚Äôt made hotdogs yet, day still young. one‚Äôs saying government force people get vaccine. government pass restrictions unvaccinated people do, entering buildings open public without correct N95 masking.

Also, no, can‚Äôt cry ‚Äúreligious exemption‚Äù face repercussions. can‚Äôt tell boss religion prevents reading responding emails. It‚Äôs little complicated that, you‚Äôre going bad time you‚Äôre trying con employer letting sole WFH employee unless legitimate reason. Awesome, accounted age that. 

You know DIDNT account for? Masking, avoiding crowded areas, following guidelines, etc. taking preventative measures decrease viral load, leading less serious outcomes. 

Don‚Äôt think enough getting flu shot likely care enough follow guidelines? 

Pulling hard conclusion, like guy originally applying did, observational study going go well best prove correlation, often tell us much It‚Äôs crazy people say ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt trust govt‚Äù ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt trust cdc‚Äù waiting FDA approval There's almost zero chance lockdowns come back barring sort supervariant something. surprised major metro areas start reintroducing capacity restrictions virtual school again.

Makes sense whatever boats float guess. question long.

already fucking long point. going get worse. think would hysterical serious pandemic. mean, really guys, stopped giving two s\*\*s people think high school. global pandemic that's wiped 600,000 Americans they're unable decide pros outweigh cons right now, research that's already done? Oh, well. would well. school yet revealed requirements guidelines next year. follow state health dept. pretty closely we‚Äôll see. important medical procedure heath done. I've multiple doctor visits medical procedures done throughout pandemic, even vaccines. always recommended still schedule necessary visits. vaccinated wear mask little fear. guy said get another spike like Europe said people wearing masks June LA reinstating masks bad idea. masks slowed surge Los Angeles. 

Not everything says true. say whatever wants without consequences selling policy. also selling Pfizer, never forget that. vaccination effective, kept selling vaccine end pandemic. hasn't, says third shot key. 

I two Pfizer, want data compared moderna get third. also would prefer delta targeted booster. So, theft. bad call :) family members got secretly vaccinated fear backlash family members. sad. glad got vaccine. Doesn‚Äôt sound like ‚Äúshow me‚Äù state me. course, that‚Äôs point. choice ask everyone wear one since way reliability differentiate. Oh worries good question. quite confident already got virus 100% asymptomatic. gf working whole foods huge city, 2 people direct department shifts tested positive (the company sent emails informing this). also time slightly sick, lost taste smell 2 weeks, plus slight wheezing 10 days.

I still kissing sleeping bed etc, never issues ever.

So guess worried side effects virus self. Problem onus enforcing vaccine passports low wage workers screamed assaulted trying get people wear masks. thanks. That's he's saying.

Full FDA approval may make dent anti-vaxxer beliefs. give stronger legal foundation companies want require vaccination. [Especially since even Maryland requiring think point unvaccinated people going catch it. need wear mask prolong inevitable? clean record get CDL, look driving trucks. tons open jobs pay really good. even get job local route you‚Äôre home every night.

Literally can‚Äôt get interstate without seeing tractor trailers advertising jobs numbers call apply. jobs tend $25/hour, sometimes OT (exact wages depend factors, like live).  Massive outbreaks biggest outbreaks amongst normal people seen entire pandemic. Compared rest world small, nearly bad first wave 2020 I've twice. 

First time knocked week extreme chest tightness, body aches exhaustion. 

Second time actually post vaccination basically mild flu upset someone didn‚Äôt. Nope, wrong 100% people think debate 2021 wrong this. Yes explain improved clinical outcomes. Wearing masks shown decrease viral load, leaving less severe cases. 

Do know apparent means? ‚ÄúSeemingly real, necessarily so‚Äù. admit DONT KNOW it‚Äôs actually protective.  number comes [COVID-19 vaccine surveillance report

~ Page 18.  Doesn‚Äôt change fact still get vaccine! say you‚Äôre death bed.

I'd prefer people like Charlie Kirk feel emboldened go around spreading harmful speech deal potential future consequences basic liberty rightfully curtailed good society. I'm betting destroy iphones like keurigs nikes.  Yes, can. odds delta variant less 5% another person wearing mask. 

And much easier socially pressure doofus wear mask grocery shopping everyone wearing theirs. Must stupid countries proof. Like Russia saying red cross help Syria spies replacing old 2019-nCoV list approved diagnostics date SARS-CoV-2 list. stopping use PCR testing. new list approved diagnostic tests. many PCR tests included: 54-year-old healthy aunt got died within month. 600k others US died one year. yeah, 20 people know need. Definitely joke. 1 vote = 1 reeeee Haha, sarcasm.   I'm aware one exposure vaccine protected from. I'm sure many evaded infections I'm oblivious to. pinned billboards everywhere  Trump-era Title 42 expel migrants border still effect, stop bullshit.  Fair. Even slightly higher, mitigations: obey law, use paths available, use lights always wear helmet. mention health benefits.

I live bike friendly place. bike 20 miles work 90 percent dedicated bike path, almost intersections. I'm spoiled sure. try least couple times week. mutates thought Peter Ohio... Trump mention letting wash us like wave... Bolsonaro same. good way cull population evil dictator. people catch it, keep mutating something worse. Americans convinced $100 yet life fear personal bankruptcy end hospital, mitigated vaccine. Weird country. Abbott probably care. state gerrymandered point probably mind losing voters. point futile mandate vaccine highly likely COVID19 (in form another) us rest time (endemic). can't control rest world. get vaccine protect encourage others same.

Who's opposite stupid? 
ROCKET SCIENTISTS.
Do rocket scientists do, people! Sigh. move Arlington month. Hopefully mask mandate gets dropped. Vote bowser out. everyone's vaccinated y'all wear masks outings, y'all safe people activities together much lower chance spread catch. 

Jfc many vaccinated people acting childish hard right concept wearing masks indoors. strongest trend vaccination rates US age. Oddly enough highest vaccinated age groups also conservative vice versa. I‚Äôll take mask day. want see card got  Maybe delta wave goes down? Wearing mask going target isn‚Äôt big deal. Maybe find jobs private sector, oh wait, also mandating vaccines Disneyland July. Observations dramatically fewer kids 12, park still loaded tons visitors. stand see young ones Good.  Hello apologize dumb question.

With recent CDC announcement really scared sure do. I've fully vaccinated months starting feel peace again, peace ended quicker expected.

We back recommended use masks vaccines might effective Delta variant indeed freaking SCARY.

My question guys go ahead mix vaccines better protected new deadly variant that's breaking havoc everywhere. got 2 Pfizer shots, would good combine let's say Moderna J&amp;J one?

Thanks advance stay safe there!

Scary times ahead us sadly.

Love &lt;3 silly simply getting shot cause someone hide identity .  


Nt dismissing people choose read r/QAnonCasualties lot stories clearly explain anyone would driven hide getting vaccine .  


But idea someone order protect health sneak out, disguise themselves, go get simple shot protect lives beyond ridiculous , upside-down world shit . people life hide getting vaccination public health emergency ? throwing resource minors dealing anti-vax parents: site doesn‚Äôt Missouri-specific resources/legal details, basic info applies. 

Hope helpful younger folks looking make sound, science based decisions protect health well being. almost entirely IV drug users share needles. People make exact argument city shutting harm reduction programs. choice, want pay it, screw them, sort stuff.

I absolutely hate idea denying health care sort punishment, even anti-vaxxers. Even insurers denied covid-related claims they're dumbass anti-vaxxers, hospital recoup $10,000/day ICU costs one way another. I'm thinking getting Ellume Binax  fact vaccinated group US also conservative. 90%+ seniors vaccinated despite conservative group wide margin. look data US, vaccination rate trends strongly age. unvaccinated group 50s least conservative group.

You hear Bezos? 2 Day Prime ship wigs mustaches low vaccinated states. Get government contract! Ah see. makes lot sense. Thanks! got binaxnow test CVS tested negative. could sworn got even though I've pfizer vaxed couple months. Felt like shit past week cough, fatigue, headache, minor muscle aches. Wrong, treatments works super effective, far. Society‚Äôs future going one wild ride UK really high rate vaccine uptake older adults. 90% people likely hospitalized vaccinated aren‚Äôt left ton people unvaccinated likely need hospitalized. Yeah, like, romantic relationship someone far removed reality? wearing mask, either; case definitely mild vaccinated. point is, picked covid exact place said shouldn't, longer use measures used mitigate kind spread (such masking, capacity limits, social distancing). It‚Äôs numbers work. 100% people vaccinated, 100% ill/hospitalized/dead would vaccinated too. doesn‚Äôt tell whole story unless mask sealed (like n95) particles still seep way sides get air.

All them? reduction? good news hear. I‚Äôve worried transmitting children can‚Äôt get vaccinated . least I‚Äôll fully vaccinated weeks. That's fair point. guess counter point would kid afraid get polio vaccine MMR would go those? realize exact scenario trial inherently comes risk. think 4 yo capable understanding risks. sorta weird parenting situation general enrolling trial suppose. Either way, trying criticizes parenting style, wanted discuss it. Stay safe! I'll get vaccinated helps.

As many times need to! younger adults teenagers still living families. There's ton pressure threat cut off, unfortunately. also destabilize already unstable living situations going mutate regardless. get used booster shots masks , impression control this. always linger, goal overwhelm hospitals wonder people would get HIV vaccine HIV became airborne.
 
It political connotation isn‚Äôt exactly endorsed by‚Ä¶ types anti-vax people. type sympathy for. They're trying right thing friends family suck humans. Damn dude, good call. rose lot slower expected also I'm sure much trust Florida report numbers get super spike like predicted. johns though, congrats.

I'm discounting paper, seem incomplete. would like data. Three fully vaccinated friends caught covid Rolling Loud Miami past week. Hoping requiring negative test vaccine proof help worries big festivals (like Hard Summer) aren't. look different stats, sure. comment replied talking cases. read without paywall ""I've decided right thing, last. ""

Also: ""I conceal identity, friends family think less me."" record bills üòÄ article week ago already outdated.

""The Centers Disease Control Prevention officially decreed fully vaccinated people tested coronavirus absence symptoms.""

Actually, changed couple days ago say fully-vaccinated people known exposure \*should\* get tested. Fuck corporate America get vaccinated Well sounds like good head shoulders, even family taking scary risks. I‚Äôm sorry. 

Just keep you‚Äôre doing! feel like health declining, might worthwhile going dr get checked anyway- least asking could make televisit appointment talk concerns. 

I live Florida totally understand concerns numbers rising breakthrough cases. concerning, agree. 

Take care :) Hey, means they're getting vaccinated, whatever Theyre saying work. Theyre saying less effective initially thought still take vaccine. can't flip script fast, messaging takes adjust *breaks laughter staring camera, picks scene immediately*   That's get Ravens fan.

I'm kidding. Hope test negative come okay. US comment responding said. .... half population vaccinated death rate 1/4 peak. means unvaccinated people, covid threat decreased 1/2, since nearly covid deaths unvaccinated today. death rise, due delta variant. continues, death rates approach peak pandemic next year. definitely depends ur going. don‚Äôt go gym see people wouldn‚Äôt wear masks least pandemic still raging. That's all. despair. frustrating people acting like virus either big deal kind political agenda. getting ridiculous. crazy fast furious wave happened.

3 weeks fine almost peak infection rate time.

1 week later half that. Says literal fool reliable Ellume rapid tests? I've seen lot people say rate false positives, seems like also extremely accurate well. I‚Äôm sure domestic travel staff seems already most. Reading comment makes feel like normalcy won‚Äôt happening anytime soon :( final stages right now. long full approval. Quick question. lucky enough get Moderna vaccine country, since I'm going back U.S. college card sufficient enough proof show vaccinated? worried able certain things vaccine mandates happen despite already fully vaccinated. know sign CA digital vaccine record either. TBH think part, masks furthest restrictions backpedal. Even notoriously cautious politicians Cuomo Biden expressed concern collateral impact heavy-handed measures last year might have. plenty data states without mask mandates last summer illustrating spread happening - outside bars/clubs almost amongst close contacts.

Face masks first suggested, widely adopted, back April 2020. Social distancing widespread masks took grocery stores restaurants virtually everywhere. IIRC, attributed major first outbreak NYC pre-mask-era public transportation use. Close quarters strangers.

You're talking someone agrees mask mandates misguided point. they're misguided virtually everyone gets covid point willingly, people need wear masks least likely abide mandates, winds punishing vaccinated. work, used. Finally covid, got vaccination. tell like info online says, people already it, first shot worse second...they body effectively shaken awake responds vigorously, second, body like:

""hold beer, got this"" also allowing anti-maskers donate (without mask course) Hope improvement continues finally move wave. aren‚Äôt socialists mandating vaccine?

Nope. That's twice throw around words clearly dont understand.

Classic American though. Brand.

Do us favor, stop watching conservative media. Take political science class local university. Sure... happened worldwide, right now... yes. issue enough vaccine go around worldwide. developing world continue place mutant strains arise may hyper contagious partially evade vaccine immunity... like delta. among vaccinated, delta still issue really... yeah get symptoms pass there's hospitalization. I'm akin say fuck it, open let evolution decide outcome. high risk want vaccine? That's buddy. whynotboth.gif I've heard, Quebec best time policies, true? Oh course, make sense, remember also significantly less risk catching even less likely, getting hospitalized COVID. numbers similar vaxed people 50. Still, add mask kids top they‚Äôre lot safer. it. wish death every day, wish I'd died. make get tested every 3 hours Also builds railroads Incentive $$$$ go God guess. don‚Äôt need stupid people.. aren‚Äôt socialists mandating vaccine? ~~Corporate~~ owners America workers: Get vaccinated get No, all. They're pretty cautious. I'm little nervous plane part, guess, since one since Covid started. Florida part! says lot people hiding political ideology, none good ~~extremely unlikely~~ impossible wave won‚Äôt peak.

FTFY live state governed Democrats, maybe.


Not much live state governed Republicans.

I know trying comfort person replying to, simple.

Republicans working block testing vaccines Wisconsin US Selective Service requires us fellas potentially sign away life interest defending nation time war. Mandating vaccines order magnitude lower signing draft something required law could certainly temporarily cost freedom potentially life.  Remember US much lesser domestic threats communisms spread Vietnam. maybe they'll require masks. rather die free USA live EU dictatorship

Well actually understand dictatorship is, throwing word around.

There specific definition, none applies EU Nevada brought back masks would opened schools time massive surge cases deaths saw winter. It‚Äôs way me. It‚Äôs right none peer reviewed validated countries. people may scream Singapore..but also using sinovac vaccines. think uncharted territory, thing consider despite antibodies levels lower parts immune system play factor mitigating this. Especially T-Cell factor. Yeah, u/nycphotogrl1, I'd recommend deleting editing previous comment confuse people spreading false optimism. moving goalposts? Deaths hospitalizations incredibly low? waste resources like this? cause panic cases rises, deaths continue stay low. Well it‚Äôs come this. government powerless mandate vaccine, corporations picking slack.

I guess know wears pants country. What? Canada lot antivaxers. countries have. pandemic itself. barrier entry lot medical jobs rather low. Technically nursing aide go around saying they‚Äôre nurse saying anti-vax get certification. lot nurses still also associate‚Äôs degree, especially areas anti-vax popular even majority opinion. people worked with, would surprised. It‚Äôs depressing politicalization everything seeped into, wel, everything. They've trying unify people ever since thing started. Thank link, really appreciate intelligent discussion matter rather typical personal insults. Couple things jump look data: 


 *Two four unable find benefit either masks respirators. third finds benefit respirators, nobody tested respirators see fit, doesn‚Äôt make sense suggests it‚Äôs probably artifact. fourth finds benefit respirators, masks.*  


So section says masks dont work, one studies shows properly fitted respirator \*\*Might\*\* help, goes say way general population wearing properly even trained doctors don't. talking properly fitting respirators, talking people wearing bandanas paper masks day. 


*You unlikely able figure use N95 respirator correctly. I‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs impossible, try really hard, assume you‚Äôre going fail unless reason think otherwise. likely outcome overpriced surgical mask might make incorrectly risk-compensate.* 


This section says even get fancy effective respirator, going wear wrong negate effectiveness.  


*Masks haven‚Äôt quite reached standards. case-control trials look good, per-protocol RCTs look good, aren‚Äôt really large-scale intention-to-treat RCTs would absolutely perfect. Even studies work, prove things health care setting family setting, ‚Äúthe community setting‚Äù general. masks haven‚Äôt proven work beyond reasonable doubt. like legal term ‚Äúnot proven guilty beyond reasonable doubt‚Äù ‚Äúnot guilty‚Äù, medical communication term ‚Äúnot proven effective beyond reasonable doubt‚Äù ‚Äúnot effective‚Äù. already muddled communication gets even worse doctors constitutionally incapable distinguishing ‚Äúno evidence for‚Äù ‚Äúthere evidence against‚Äù ‚Äì explanation one.* 


This section clearly says MAY little support really conclusive data. data comparison healthcare setting, walking around grocery store wearing paper mask day. 


And fantastic conclusion article: 


*I mean sure, mask might make 0.0001% (or whatever) less likely get infected. that‚Äôs worth you, consider possibility might freaking little much whole pandemic thing. it‚Äôs still worth it, go it.* Yeah I'm sick people reddit keeps yelling ""But who's decide speech harmful hateful?"" certain point, society recognize speech much harm good. Unfortunately, doubt ever going happen countries larger population.

So looks like we'll stuck periodic mask mandates? still lived dc would you. Yeah it‚Äôs kind self fulfilling prophecy, new normal people ones refuses get vaccinated Covid continued spread mutate, leading Delta variant widespread 

It sucks around Man hit nail head this. feel same. Yup. Mixed messaging, shit policy, political theater...


Not problem time, got vaccine. It‚Äôs worlds, job, cater minority won‚Äôt get vaccine. covering anything. vaccines designed stop severe cases, completely prevent covid transmission. fact, went ours, told us specifically still get transmit virus even vaccinated.

Just people understand think ""lol I'm vaccinated give fuck anything anymore!"" make true.

The vaccines performing well. Nature thing long people either careless idiotic vaccinated. shot vaccines, nature works. endgame since beginning.

Since Spring 2020 Fauci used one metric - 10k Cases per day nationally still testing. almost got late June 12k Delta rebound (67k 7-day average today).

If want claim deaths lower due vaccinations such, fine. Let's use 7-day average Daily Deaths target. Pre-vaccinations, 10k Cases would result 180 Deaths per day COVID (compared annualized rate Influenza deaths ranging 35-170 per day last 50 years). So, essentially Fauci, et. al. saying along, ""when get COVID like bad flu, respond like bad flu"". Deaths bottomed 228 early June currently 303. would great want more. want freakin life. stopped blood letting, wearing masks. wonder why? wait damn second ..are novax ""people"" complaining oppression violence them? I'm worried near-miraculous decline abruptly horrifyingly reversed ""Freedom Day."" It‚Äôs weird much severity seems luck. couple centenarians who‚Äôve survived unscathed, young athletes didn‚Äôt. Novel viruses super weird. excuse USOC‚Äôs failure require vaccination. Pathetic. School districts caving large vocal minority masks without realizing parents likely withdraw children ones worried covid. pandemic particular nightmare parents children preexisting medical conditions, lost option person schooling altogether. I‚Äôve patient Idaho tell wife going pissed getting vaccinated needed see immunocompromised sister didn‚Äôt want risk life. willing help stop spread?  japan donating millions pfizer AZ vaccines countries though? he's citizen?  unbelievable nurses science background access tons doctors still stupid stance. infertility issues. looked it. exist. another bit pernicious misinformation.

Do know else affect fertility ? dead. beat long covid baby impossible climbing Mount Everest. Good luck! work maybe MD help find place it. one says shut down. 

You realize hospitals areas low vaccination rates high cases already getting overwhelmed. Achilles heel system, need healthcare systems function. beyond infuriating. Us vaxxed part. events I've looking forward months get canceled. We'll back limited access public spaces. going office. Life back indefinite hell hole restrictions ""encourage"" bottom half intelligence country something NEVER DO.

When end? anyone give shit people's mental psyche? anyone care causing real depression long term effect health?

I think I'm going wear time. Screw it. wore show belief science policy, we're point science says vaxxed fine policy blows. highly doubt going go well. antivax marches London biggest world. That‚Äôs completely understandable. Thanks reply. got tested urgent care day asked fully vaxxed when. Mandates happening alarming sets dangerous precedent companies government impose medical treatments individuals deem necessary. Together media uncanny ability manipulate public opinion discourse mob rule.

It's extremely unfortunate people die COVID19. point cannot eradicate it. like can't eradicate Influenza kills 10's thousands per year. Neither death sentence. However, COVID19 much deadly vulnerable population elderly. Humans accept live COVID19 assume risks willing take.

The good news vaccine both. Additionally, highly likely humans begin create natural immunity pass generations like Spanish Flu. Oh god, he's conspiracy nut, too. UK = bad lot media people days, especially Reddit. I‚Äôd rather die free USA live EU dictatorship Fall 2020 vaccines. do.

They might effective thanks variants, still offer adequate protection, still get already. resource questions. Cry mfing river. Repost. Cool epitaph tombstone. They‚Äôre going ask REALLY nicely time. Ofc response third one caring weapon, I'm personally concerned others so, *and work venue*. might however stand outside criticize venues logic basis would someone carries illegal weapon venue comply wearing device? 

A better analogy perspective, although works, allowed carry pocket knife venue letting people assault rifles samurai swords? That‚Äôs CDC worry about. understanding it‚Äôs low risk children. that‚Äôs true, requirements emergency approval lower. not? *laughs hysterically florida* adding USA yet recognized AZ valid vaccine, less 1bn vaccinated people allowed entry US

Hope change soon mean, usually pay screenwriters good money come shit like this. new variant may already happened corner US spreading undetected, wave blend right Delta.

This pretty reckless speculation. Correct wrong, would require new *strain*, *variant*, bypass existing antibodies. confirmed antibodies/immunity variant cross-compatible? that's correct, Delta basically forced vaccine antivaxxers :P Stimulus checks vaccinated. Let's go. 1% would die Covid would probably passed away near future something else anyways. world populated anyways let‚Äôs natural purge happen‚Ä¶ worries side affects vaccines future might end killing 1% Covid survival rate‚Ä¶  Like said. reached 80-90% eligible people vaccinated, would reverting mask mandates. huge difference sick return work 10 days long debilitating condition. would guess can‚Äôt return symptoms. sinus infection month small cold, would landed COVID? bizzare? US Isreal cases fall initial vaccine roll out. takes time go back vaccine approved yet kids 15. They‚Äôre starting trials now. question ever get approved kids 10. So, totally miss past year something?

You realize asymptomatic transmission main reason virus spreads rapidly, right?

You could already might even know. I'm surprised all. cult, death one. paraphrase Dr. Fauci loosely, science changed, virus itself.  know what‚Äôs funny. Biden everyone administration, especially social media effort GUARANTEED 100 days masks would gone good. lie. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll people defending based party affiliation, anyone else, bait switched like this, would ripped shreds. Several US states 80% vaccination now. approaching 90%. vaccines effective against

They're effective hospitalization. Breakthroughs asymptomatic infections spreading vaccinated definitely occur delta though. smarties analogy directly addressing vaccinated people got long covid, worse death.

No, I'm pretty sure dying worse outcome even extreme cases Long Covid.

I‚Äôm going back wearing mask *crowded* indoor places won‚Äôt changing behaviors. I‚Äôm still gonna things want do. symptoms? Yeah mean get saying, one 6 week long symptoms one lingering could say sniffles cough probably anything people worry suffer much from. small study kind brings questions gives us answers, trying hold something developed comes along feel super pessimistic doomed Uh, - particularly compared measures. going bar restaurant taking anyway eat. 

It's literally simplest, cheapest measure take, also happens one effective ones. What's helps prevent us getting point seriously consider devastating mitigation practices. 

And honestly, virus running completely amuck positivity rate 30+% like many states, going hurt businesses lot simple mask mandate. Ya'll peak right now. There's way we're way numbers looking.

Not sure temporary either nearly every state (even Florida) cases dropping 1-2 days ago state NY seeing drastic plummet since last week. likely Delta contagious likely around since early summer (and there's drastic uptick vaccinations hard hit states) wave going quicker we've previously seen. like don‚Äôt understand downvotes -.- seeing absolutely mandated without full FDA approval. may like it, change reality. People already talking taking booster shots account new variants.

If new variants pop up, take booster shots immunity them.  believe 38k multi day data dump...  You‚Äôve given plenty scientific support you‚Äôre choosing ignore, it‚Äôs quite clear you‚Äôre interested anything troll. BRB moving Lithuania ***Akshually***, per mile bicycles much lower serious injury rate autos. probably opposite, hospitalized severe illness recover probably significantly immune. Plenty studies correlated severity subsequent antibody titers.

Here's reason young healthy previously asymptomatic people may likely reinfection.

Stories like poster happen, however outliers anecdata. Reddit loves anecdotes. better follow scientific data information macro level like what's coming UK Israel. odds becoming permanently injured/dying car wreck?

Because smarties analogy directly addressing *vaccinated* people got long covid, worse death. opinion mother getting daughter vaccinated? uptake Vaccine North Ireland hit brick wall expect people 30 take it. Anti Vax protests common sources blame guys USA. going serious problem closing pandemic bracing 3rd wave next weeks. hospitals already full. get mods want threads devolve anti-R airings grievance honestly, who's responsible shit? Looking forward taking job anti-vaxxxer.  down-low vaxxers getting secret. mess. would guess employees customers? Seems like place like Shake Shack would tough enforce customers. next stimulus check

lol Kids probably allowed donate blood. think number makes lot sense. Pass around Mountain Dew Beer watch heads explode. Back November, El Paso hospitals rationing care, flying patient cities, using prison inmates clear bodies: summer 2021, Rio Grande Valley patients flown cities, waiting ambulances beds open up, converted hospital office spaces patient care: Dakotas last fall, states authorized Covid-positive healthcare workers continue working severe shortages medical care providers: Around 50% Americans get flu vaccine year. DC

It's baffling. DC success story comparison places. Covid deaths time low hospitilizations trending downward. Really good vaccination rate well continuing. plenty issues, Covid likely top 20.  Agree points. can‚Äôt find particular data referenced apologize- yes, expected vs observed trend myocarditis pericarditis tread increase age decrease major point concern.

Until continue wearing masks protect kids others. Sigh. anti-vaxxers discrimination also favour discrimination? Sounds right. I'm amazed people genuinely think AstraZeneca, listed company worth $100B selling life-saving cancer drugs outrageous prices ($15k 30 pills Tagrisso) suddenly decided turn charity. 

It investment, PR also expected make profit rich countries future. bad completely fucked stuck poorer countries make profit with. Voice reason? whole schpeel debate doom, gloom fear... ""400,000 dead"" literally opened one debate.

The problem literally nobody politics voice reason here. people one side literally pretending virus even exist fear dial turned 11. Yes covid bad, zombie apocalypse type shit. Yes need fear dial turned up, maybe solid 4 5. 

The vaccines work well enough... vaccinated stay hospital. Covid probably ever eliminated point, keeps mutating slowly strain breaks immunity materialize nothing weak cold immune previous variants (either infection vaccine). people dumb decide get vaccinated, hospitalization potential risk they're choosing themselves. can't whole country world suffer people make stupid decisions life. data noisy, exponential/logistic projections noisy data inherently unstable, projections going crap.  garbage in, exponential garbage out.

see seen -- true? getting downvoted suggesting mask mandates impact businesses (ask anyone entertainment industry), ignoring people care meaningful social experiences others, making money. many doses (phrased like ""One dose two-dose vaccine, two doses two-dose vaccine, one dose one-dose vaccine..."") date vaccination. Changes behavior like schools letting summer. source ""thousands people died it""?

Every measure exists demonstrates stimulus effective use money, particular direct payments individuals largest positive impact. 

Please take head ass. world less dark sun shine, promise. I‚Äôm tired anti-vaccine idiots. FFS, alive rn vaccines diseases. month gone 200 - 300 600 - 700 per day. words we've moment nearing worst daily cases we've whole pandemic. I'd say real increase 300 700 began around 07/17. becasue cannot breathe mouth breather easier. death rate (always trailing statistic) roughly flat past month, Cases 424% Hospitalizations 126% bottoms 3 weeks ago. Given known curves exponential growth, high Case/Hospital/Death numbers think masking would appropriate?

All 7-day averages NJ:

* Cases: 181 July 6; 768 July 28
* Hospitalizations: 308 July 5; 387 July 24
* Deaths: 4.0 July 9; 3.9 July 28 given plenty scientific support. interested that. interested arguing justifying bias. Shut up, totalitarian selfish pig. plan like half population actively non-compliant? Like‚Ä¶ actually want do? California instituted restrictions police force one town said wouldn‚Äôt enforce it. Employees get bitten, hit, shot trying make sure anti-maskers don‚Äôt enter establishment. can‚Äôt mandatory vaccinations like September vaccines get full clearance even know people get medical religious exemptions. 

I guess mean is‚Ä¶ CDC, would do? would handle pandemic? Show study that's scientific, researched-based, peer-reviewed conclusively determines masks completely ineffective stopping spread covid, maybe I'll believe fight.

See sounds? requested using bad analogies, playing game, yes... absolutely would request take mask mask day sweating, eating, taking dump.  
Luckily talking opening body cavity, talking wearing mask strolling around grocery store, think knew that. Masks work - lesser extent people willing accept. N95‚Äôs definitely give wearer clear level protection. surgical/cloth masks, impact much nuanced really help everyone wearing one TIME. 

Mask mandates public stores/restaurants mostly theater - vast majority infections happen amongst close contacts brief public interactions(this backed number studies). Covid (even delta) super mutant spreads walking past stranger talking someone store 3 minutes. mask mandates mostly misdirected. 

Many states/counties mask mandates watched cases ballooned last winter. things work stop spread covid are, distance &amp; vaccinations. 

Seeing we‚Äôre distancing vaccinations level need , seems silly expect covid anything spread reaches level endemic equilibrium. 

This always plan. Offer everyone vaccine throw rest wolves, that‚Äôs exactly we‚Äôre doing. 

I‚Äôm LA county, first place put mask mandate back effect it‚Äôs evident mask mandate PR stunt county able say ‚Äúthey tried slow covid down‚Äù. didn‚Äôt. Every single person public health knows - we‚Äôre mission let covid rip population fast possible keeping hospitals safe overwhelmed. 

So mask mandates phase pandemic really make risk averse feel safe let bunch antivaxxers die. seems working based comments sub LOL. Someone would yell you. workplaces tracking that. 

You also get exposure notifications download states app phone, enough users really work well. I'd imagine companies would way verify federal state division actually vaccinated, would much harder fake Please stop lying. Please. dangerously stupid misinformation obviously absolutely clue immunology. I.mean could said covid deaths regardless vaccine. vaccinated safe. they're immunocompromised rethink it, especially going Delta epicenter Florida, otherwise they're protected. 38,000 previous day, though. 

I'm starting think correct [in slight downturn happening, may fully wave within 2-3 weeks.

Some good news, too: U.S vaccination rates [picking back saw spring, hard hit delta states. Agreed -- like mask mandates grocery stores, Home Depot, Target, etc. driving force mask wearing local mandates lot cases. moderate large increase?  
I know guys good numbers, guess vaccine rates(hopefully) also starting make real difference. good they're starting collect -- specifically ask?
(vaccine type? date(s) vaccination?) surprising all. Disney World-obsessed adults unstable selfish people I've ever met. Ah yes, blood clotting affected tiny amount people, vaccine undoubtably saved hundreds/thousands lives start year vaccine worse virus according them. mean... good? think? 

I hate secret, like happening. Great. get tested? clarify, didn‚Äôt mean say said that. It‚Äôs that‚Äôs sort meme/common terminology measure badness covid sort ‚Äúcloseness cold.‚Äù

We live, still don‚Äôt know we‚Äôve hit escape velocity though. many respects clearly haven‚Äôt, even smaller respects, like deciding it‚Äôs time start going socializing again. dunno, I‚Äôll weather lot means less likelihood getting long Covid. low patience new chronic health issues avoid them. antivirals redundant immunity booster shot months from, damn might wanna wait that. It‚Äôs world want catch covid in? hold bit catch world prescription pill stronger immune response, seems desirable without overbearing. Vax Merstappen? agree. Missouri know support you. one ever know, keep card hidden. neighbor got secret none would know family. outraged. terrible. y'all 70s. Different administration shit really, really understand science, you? CDC guideline per week per day. stupidly low threshold DC technically it. Shake Shack requiring vaccine customers employees. absolutely right according CDC said hours ago. literally said continue way we‚Äôre going virus could mutate point vaccines aren‚Äôt effective. 

All say give up. I‚Äôm going try best enjoy world, whatever way life live. wouldn‚Äôt protest lockdown know lot country would.  sides stupid. feel like Trump elected conservatives would trying GET everyone get vaccinated liberals would fighting it. Flattening curve saves lives covid patients, patients can't get care need hospitals overwhelmed covid cases. 'solution' kills random unvaccinated idiots. ""Just flu"" thing anyway. couple years back ""just flu"" made feel like total shit days, even though usually shrug 2 days (my doctor always wants give entire week work always negotiate 3 days apparently I'm idiot). totally see could kill someone who's already bad shape.

I still go way get flu shots, log onto website click ""yes"" would. endpoints vaccine trials (severe) symptomatic infection. miracle early real world data showed prevented transmission. bonus. However pre-Delta. vaccine prevents hospitalization weak. Ending statement ""no vaccine 100 percent effective preventing disease 100 percent safe individuals."" strawman argument 100% statistic exist nature also implied mentioned. Therefore, engaging good faith. attacking you. demanding ""miss us"" strawmen. fallacies place good faith discussion. Furthermore, one trying play semantics game disingenuous also trying asset original discussion implying safety regulation needed vaccines not. simply states process approval different completely different. FDA website shows different approval processes basic understanding science also shows this. renders entire statement moot top filled bad faith statements. Thus, shooting correctly. support. legitimately asking actual scientific support. find alot studies challenge idea find alot people want attack belittle scientific data without much research. response typical, personal attack support. Absolutely! I‚Äôm way meaning diminish game changer vaccines are. we‚Äôre seeing, need vaccinated people definitely need tools box.  think trust FDA ?! reread wrote. 

FDA literally provide BLA tests done pfizer BLA approval [January said FDA would approve even pfizer released early tests would outrages FDA would loose readability (and ritfully so) . too, thank you!  case already European countries. Diseases become endemic epidemiological standpoint they're regularly found amongst population sustained community transmission without external input. Basically, R0 1 long period time. infected person infects average 1 person. number cases go time.

Chickenpox good example (or, was, started vaccinating children chickenpox.) ""chickenpox season"". kind exists always there.

Covid probably contagious ever become endemic definition, common cold. Nobody ever talks common cold epidemic, even though cold season definitely thing.

When they're talking covid becoming endemic, mean going eradicated like smallpox, probably going cycle like cold flu year get less severe time goes on.

It's pretty likely next 10-20 years, exposure covid child either vaccination natural infection decrease lethality sufficient point nobody really worry it. Covid become new seasonal cold. Routine vaccination healthy adults covid stop, they'll probably continue vaccinate elderly people health issues would make dangerous (like pneumonia now). think certain point, people see 30k cases per day start taking precautions would causes cases flatten out. see 30k cases again, 83k seems like someone crunching numbers assuming people continue operating today even cases skyrocket. life sentence going bring back severe restrictions simply due cases rising, would *already done so* cases five times higher month ago, likely continue rise several weeks least. Given that, think harsher restrictions yet returned? fact vaccines effective preventing serious disease death even rising case numbers, need. insurance companies going start denying coverage unvaccinated?  wait til get sick find immunity die ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è apparently really can‚Äôt fix stupid thought 64% effective preventing infection. agree, I've somewhat grown resent ""the Venn diagram anti-vaxxers ____ circle"" type comments. world complicated people walks life get vaccinated one half-cocked reason another. Well, vaccines still excellent protection serious illness death. hospital numbers rising hopefully motivator. without Delta. 

It's almost certainly lower regarding Delta. mandates ever go away? don‚Äôt know I‚Äôm inclined trust data. Israel seems outlier data. government (dems r's) dont give flying fuck single person. give flying fuck holding onto power extracting much tax money possible lining pockets. One same. Makes sense go back masking distancing enough people get vaxxed catch it

This makes sense vacuum also resigns us wearing masks indefinitely significant portion population get vaccinated. Source? ‚Äúother things‚Äù well? don‚Äôt see benefit I‚Äôm healthy mid 30‚Äôs male. workout 5 days week eat healthy. figured would drop people know:

My brother law, wife tested positive covid. us vaccinated. us symtomatic. stay safe there. Even vaccinated im pretty damn sick sit type this. Adapting difficult circumstances stressful. Especially first encounters lead us changes information presentation communication patterns we're used to. 

Take step back, talk friend. good get relief way going back adjusting present circumstances. Yes, take risks endure order prevail. No, said ""few mutations"". ignorant lol? get vaccine reduce prevalence disease. People wearing masks since polio vaccination example. told still wear masks, even though we're vaccinated, for? Australia 40+yo access first shot. I'm looking September get it. think might well donate vaccines US countries citizens willing take them. fact breakthroughs vaccinated people still contacting virus gives fence sitters reason get it. say ""See! work! even get it?"" Falls 80%? Wasn‚Äôt like 64% last week? UK showing opposite.
Let's spread virus much get everyone immune one way other. Peer review magic. one two experts looking paper checking makes sense. organization like CDC, experts hand, checks themselves; necessary wait peer review take months.

Anyway, underlying issue (transmissibility Delta fully vaccinated people) verified single study multiple ways different methodologies, likely right. anyone know much efficacy affected second dose isn‚Äôt four five months later? Friend mine got first dose back April probably can‚Äôt get next one soon due lockdown/supply issues. vaccinated, COMPLY mask mandates. Vaccines work!  Herd immunity works relatively sterilizing Immunity, never promised (and shown original studies - 5% leftover 95% effectiveness). slowing spread, dramatically Feb May, opened things back *almost fucking it* propaganda-mainlining, personal freedom-idolizing variant-incubators refused vaccine, backsliding. Well, shit. That's rate unvaccinated infections. Certainly absolute number breakthrough infections lower, seeing rate PASC among really disheartening. Wow! I'm impressed using big words.

And here's article Reddit comments read educate yourself. really need social distance subreddit. problem saying something even authors study don‚Äôt say. don‚Äôt conclude flu vaccine protective covid. 
Correlation =/= causation give good explanation saying it‚Äôs possible receive flu shot likely take precautions comes covid. 
Maybe receive flu shots simply health conscious take precautions (wear wear masks, follow guidelines), could explain don‚Äôt test positive much without flu shots, and, get sick, presumably less viral load due following guidelines wearing masks, generally end less severe symptoms. 

If authors damn study don‚Äôt agree you‚Äôre saying, maybe don‚Äôt say it. real point, IMO, shortcut process new virus becoming less deadly time people‚Äôs immune systems gain experience fighting it. seems doing! Getting tested exposure seems like common sense. 

I know people complain this, honestly seems perfectly warrented. one thread said look basic stats figure safe enough get back normal. Everyone else wants know exactly talking about, get there, gave nothing concrete, nebulous idea 'save life.'

We also 'save life' outlawing cars airplanes, ban candy skydiving, mean makes sense so. cars killing 1 10 passengers, that's different story.

So want know, threshold you? could actually admit actually statistically difficult question probably never truly say sure, actually going feelings anything else? us ever get to. imperative shut economy asap late US, evidence hospitals actually unable care sick patients need admitted?

Yes, unfortunately. Like parts  COVID-19 patients turned away overwhelmed hospital southwestern Missouri amid surge cases, taken less-stressed hospitals hundreds miles away Kansas City St. Louis.

And First limiting elective surgical procedures four Brevard County hospitals, effective Thursday continuing Aug. 15, reaction surge COVID-19 patients. 
 
Health First spokesman Lance Skelly said hospital company ""will postponing scheduled, non-emergent surgeries procedures require hospital bed.""

The problem Delta spreads much, apparently deadly previous variants, hit unvaccinated REALLY hard. vaccinated people ALSO spreading it, helps hit unvaccinated people really hard. much preferred headline used Hill, personally: ‚ÄúTexas doctor warns COVID-19 cases rising among children.‚Äù

I tried posting one first, apparently articles manually approved sub, went original article Houston Chronicle instead‚Äîwhich unfortunately sensationalist headline. gonna get bad awhile, possibly really bad. many people sub dramatic It‚ÄôLl NeVER EnD shit. surge new contagious variant. Cases rise, eventually fall. Maybe weeks, maybe months. Mask cautious till then. It‚Äôs really complicated tbh. also big concerns places like African nations. nearly enough vaccines available. RemindMe 1 day! Here‚Äôs article:

In addition revising mask guidance Tuesday, Centers Disease Control Prevention also quietly updated testing recommendations people fully vaccinated coronavirus.
The agency advises vaccinated people tested virus come contact someone Covid-19, even symptoms. Previously, health agency said fully vaccinated people need tested exposure virus unless experiencing symptoms.
‚ÄúOur updated guidance recommends vaccinated people get tested upon exposure regardless symptoms,‚Äù Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky, agency‚Äôs director, said email New York Times. ‚ÄúTesting widely available.‚Äù
Fully vaccinated people wear mask public indoor spaces exposure, agency said. Three five days later, tested virus.
If results come back negative, stop wearing masks indoors. results positive, infected isolate home 10 days.
Although people fully vaccinated may still get infected virus, breakthrough infections tend mild asymptomatic. vaccines authorized United States provide strong protection worst outcomes, including severe disease, hospitalization death, including Delta variant.
The new testing recommendation came day agency recommended fully vaccinated people return wearing masks indoors circumstances. levels community transmission high, everyone, regardless vaccination status, wear masks indoors public, agency says.
The agency also recommended vaccinated people close contact unvaccinated people, including children age 12, consider wearing masks public indoor spaces whatever transmission rates local community. shift, agency also recommended universal masking schools.
For months, C.D.C. resisted recommending masks vaccinated people, even highly contagious Delta variant spread World Health Organization recommended continued mask wearing.
The change prompted new data suggesting even vaccinated people infected Delta may carry large amounts virus transmit others, Dr. Walensky said news briefing Tuesday. I've slower speeds 5g switch 4g stable service. RemindMe 3 days! Yes. feel safe major infection death covid since I'm vaccinated, keep variants case need realign lifestyle. mask indoors much others otherwise live life close pre 2020 possible. friend doctor Germany, involved research this, he's quite positive it. really like they're seeing. I‚Äôve saying this. I‚Äôd walk places. It‚Äôs bs. Yeah, we're *definitely* going need boosters somewhere along line.

Cue ""new mask mandate remaining place boosters available"" announcements specific governments. Oh boy. Ironic CDC said masks unnecessary initially last year save PPE hospitals

The CDC's argument time masks work, work well enough outside clinical setting remotely worth creating shortages clinical settings.

With believed time, entirely correct. Ordinary laymen trained aseptic technique, early days saw public constantly mishandling masks (they still do, even moreso now); reusing masks instead cleaning/disposing, shoving used masks pockets, touching faces rubbing masks faces, holding masks improperly, wearing masks like chin-strap, etc. Stuff would tolerated hospital.

As turns though, know risk infection contact surfaces [is extremely breathing aerosols concern. means fact everyone potentially getting coronavirus hands, nose mouth handling masks properly irrelevant.

With CDC work time, way knowing masks far effective reducing transmission among ordinary public expected. scientific understanding effect aerosol transmission brand new. That‚Äôs stupid. people choosing get vaccine, let face consequences. Don‚Äôt give ‚Äúbut children‚Äù bullshit either. you‚Äôre actually worried kid dying Covid, aren‚Äôt taking capacity theme park. Passenger deaths per 100,000,000 vehicle miles come 3.35 1975 1.11 2019. 2/3s reduction. get 3rd?

But looking effectiveness within context individual years provide clear picture (e.g. hospital/ICU/death vaccinated vs unvaccinated *within specific year*). Several studies demonstrate effectiveness flu vaccines, few:

[Influenza Vaccination Mortality: Differentiating Vaccine Effects found flu shots reduced all-cause mortality among elderly Kaiser Permanente members 4.6% 9 laboratory-defined flu seasons Northern California. researchers reported flu shots reduce mortality much greater amounts. meta-analysis results 20 cohort case-control studies, Voordouw et al. (6) found flu shots reduce winter deaths 50%, average; recent study, Nichol et al. (19) reported 48% reduction all-cause mortality among elderly flu season. However, Simonsen et al. (11, 12, 20) found excess mortality attributable influenza 5%‚Äì10% average flu seasons past several decades. argued flu shots could possibly prevented deaths 5%‚Äì10% deaths flu-related (11‚Äì13). estimate excess mortality flu season 7.8%, consistent Simonsen et al.‚Äôs nationwide estimate lower estimates made others excess mortality 7.8% found population 60% vaccine coverage. findings suggest none elderly vaccinated, excess mortality flu season would averaged 9.8%. **We infer 4.6% estimate amounts 47% reduction (4.6/9.8 = 47%) number flu-attributable deaths would occurred none elderly vaccinated.**

[Influenza Vaccination Modifies Disease Severity Among Community-dwelling Adults Hospitalized Influenza vaccination associated reduction odds in-hospital death among patients aged 18-49 years (adjusted odds ratios [aOR] = 0.21; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.05 0.97), 50-64 years (aOR = 0.48; 95% CI, 0.24 0.97), ‚â•65 years (aOR = 0.39; 95% CI, 0.17 0.66).

From I've checked jumping gun fully drop masks. Yes high rate gotten first jabs, means half way covered. Thats higher chance spreading getting sick compared fully vaxxed.

Hopefully social pressure everyone else back office, one person dial every meeting encourages get vaccinated. Personally, think it‚Äôd awkward rest coworkers person meetings one outlier not.

""lockdowns localized""  Children rarely die covid. They‚Äôre likely die flu. 75 million children live US less 400 died covid. hysteria getting hand. agree, wanted check numbers. Hmm, looks like societies vaccinated hard time...

I wonder - vaccinations limit severe illness also transmission rate? party ~~states rights~~, ~~local rights~~, ~~federal rights~~ -- ok fine, whichever happen control time.

Note: name party question, post apolitical. become fully protected 9th booster dose

(sarcasm) üòÇ bet Google one two lawyers looked policy announced it. sound like Sufficient. people getting sick chose get free vaccine 
 
Did read post commenting on? exactly point we're arguing. He's saying vaccinated people care people choose get vaccinated risk. really don't.. Go get shots, like rabid dog student, perhaps direct anger toward fellow unvaccinated classmates driving recommendations.

Most people know school vaccinated FFS sweet monorail hospital Shorter incubation period among unvaccinated asymptomatic cases due people vaccinated would guess. Basically severe illness hits quicker since vaccines many places go. Nah, I'm good Nah, 7th dose good-er look back remember people wanted lock downs could get vaccine ready mutations make herd immunity impossible.

When freshly vaccinated, still specific antibodies specific B cells produce hanging around body, obliterate new covid infection immediately. time clear out, leaving memory cells reactivate body's defences get covid again, there's obviously going short delay compared immunity fresh.

But people shouldnt put head sand either. absolutely still get delta vaccinated, still get pretty damn sick. think true. least someone Texas did. went Oklahoma got it. That‚Äôs gut telling, although disease expert economist :)

It‚Äôs looking good. virus rampaging across world. Thank CCP Wuhan. actually got $5 gc them. Although reason got vaccinated didn‚Äôt staff it.

It wasn‚Äôt problem beds. problem ventilators staff training use them.

LA absolutely issue, El Paso many smaller cities. Patients weren‚Äôt given care had. Patients literally beds gift shop stuck back ambulance hours.

It‚Äôs also covid. People accidents medial emergencies 24/7. overwhelmed staff means people don‚Äôt get care need. also means they‚Äôre risk covid top whatever emergency landed hospital.

Basically- beds never issue. always came staffing. hospital staff already burned out. podcast *LeVar Burton Reads* episode months ago read short story based similar concept.

And second, 23 people total, peer reviewed published. makes article nonsense point. They‚Äôve aggressively last six months. people willfully ignoring torrent get vaxxed messaging ones blame. Besides, CDC never closed single business. CDC telling vaccinated people infectious non-vaccinated, hard know think.

Yes, could test positive test picked asymptomatic infection. point may may later develop symptoms (the vaccine likely recent helping, cause harm either). Seriously. That‚Äôs that‚Äôs left point. That's really fucked help cancer. Please would mess trump pudding brains, would claiming covid 19 issue anymore republican states would parroting thing. That's joke hang like two people outside work one hung maskless bunch vaccinated people indoors hours. Turns one covid get tested. Totally sucks reminded that, despite vaccinated, time one ""bubble"" people (mind vaccination hung one) could still give covid friends/contacts. He'll turn advantage. Federalism.

Vaccinated drivers would nice. says it‚Äôs dangerous children? read that. would suggest people like wife small kids, work outside house? idea thing kids. Delta hospitalizing killing kids days. I'm perfectly peace advocating children's health expense people willingly choosing avoid vaccine.

Kudos orgs It‚Äôs literally killing people every race. act everyone US doesn‚Äôt ability get vaccine. Ha, 3 days ago unrelated thread said, ""just cause sucks worse somewhere else mean suck.""

I know mental health matters. know sucks right now. masks hill die on. masks symptom issue, issue enough people vaccinated prevent mutations galloping communities again. 

It's comparing situation pain losing loved one COVID. complaining wearing mask wearing mask could PREVENT someone dying COVID. 

Duke everything keep people campus. work university boat. cost hundreds millions - literally - get 2020 god want students remote again. want back campus, timing delta wave bumping start fall semester completely sucks. Masks help.

Good luck fall. Natural degradation. 

It's pre-Delta (only March) India modi fucking idiot No. Editing existing mRNA vaccine include new strain fairly easy apparently.

Pfizer currently testing Delta booster. Uh‚Ä¶ true, state registry. Whether check go dependent organization. mean people literally can't get vaccines like people history adverse reactions children same! Jason Mendoza probably super spreader. I'm going bet lawyers Ford already waiting billable hours. I'll gladly keep wearing mask.

And apparently, new guidelines released, üòâ true. I‚Äôve pasted references cloth masks comprehensive review studies mask efficacy US National Academy Sciences preponderance evidence indicates mask wearing reduces transmissibility per contact reducing transmission infected respiratory particles laboratory clinical contexts. Public mask wearing effective reducing spread virus compliance high. Given current shortages medical masks, recommend adoption public cloth mask wearing, effective form source control, conjunction existing hygiene, distancing, contact tracing strategies.

Simple cloth masks present pragmatic solution use public. supported health bodies. 

Multiple simulation studies show filtration effects cloth masks relative surgical masks. Generally available household materials 58% 94% filtration rate 1-Œºm bacteria particles, whereas surgical masks filtered 96% particles 

Another study used manikin visible smoke simulate coughing, found stitched cloth mask effective tested designs source control, reducing jet distance directions 8 feet (with mask) 2.5 inches 

Overall, appears cloth face covers provide good fit filtration PPE community contexts, results vary depending material design, way used, setting used. kinda don‚Äôt think ‚Äúwear off.‚Äù People SARS Classic 18 years ago still immune now, so, think B cell immunity probably long term deal. Right? Newest mandate vaccinated people keep unvaccinated people safe. called pussy sheep reward so. Fuck that, add unvaccinated surcharge insurance plans, set hard limit hospital beds used unvaxxed patients free beds people need ailments keep pushin. Enough enough Wow it‚Äôs incredible stupid fuck areas problem! It‚Äôs baffling. one could seen coming! Honestly, one cares enforce anymore. I'm LA people wear masks, ones pressured much. take bus someone mask on, they'll still allowed bus anyway. Hell, sometimes even bus driver mask on. trains. Even I'm willing enforce much work; want get involved fight. went Zara last winter saw woman trying clothing mask; allowed try clothing time due covid. worker came told put mask try clothes, said okay. walked away went right back doing. started questioning strategy making businesses enforce mask mandates back last June bc seems trouble worth. don‚Äôt think make statement country whole. states increasing. review costs associated COVID-19 care, national independent nonprofit Fair Health published report late last year saying **""an average COVID hospitalization complications costs roughly $156,000 someone insurance basic COVID hospital stay costing $29,000**.""

Bolding mine.

I think lot people going lose homes. mean saying lately, Americans something like $400 deal emergencies.  Sad. UK spike, let return normal numbers count yet hope not. would like practicing germ warfare military would weaken US readiness. Yup...therein lies problem indeed. Ugh... proper response, computer crashed.

Condensed version:

Jerome Adams (Powell Fed) could perfectly good message left middle people ‚Äî STOP BUYING MASKS! T~~hey effective preventing general public catching #Coronavirus, but~~ health care providers can‚Äôt get care sick patients, puts communities risk!‚Äù

But also caught ton flak [even real CDC mask recommendations announced what, week that? said known wrong time said it.

Yes, lot confusion mixed messaging early on, time, feels little disingenuous say ""Well, wrong then, can't trust anything say now"". Oh absolutely. I‚Äôm gonna it. I‚Äôm gonna resent fuck do. pissed government extremely atrocious vaccine rollout farce been. Nope. take measures based future risk estimation idiotic ‚Äúevidence based science‚Äù. CDC never dropped mask guidance. I‚Äôll get vaccine offering 1000 bucks it. EU/EEA country 67% fully vaccinated though! numbers flat wrong. would say unfortunately, idiots everywhere. seems human trait one favorite voices whole pandemic. balanced thoughtful. science first thinker straight shooter. Wish good reference, tell find predictions crisis historically pretty good. carrot offered, I'm going lose sleep switch stick. canada myself, think ever people dying street. (Did hear least one patient manitoba somewhere died transit US hospital, can't assume would lived otherwise).

What certainly happened though 'non essential' stuff got pushed way back, including minor things like cancer screenings, etc. material knock-on effects system's resources sucked Covid. Sure! one example masks good cant imagine variant escapes immunity degree‚Ä¶ feel like point different disease together. Idk. sure hope don‚Äôt deal Try think numbers terms really extreme example. Would rather play Russian roulette gun 6 bullets, gun 2 bullets? guess that‚Äôs average everyone I‚Äôve seen, vaccination not. Hope ok.  seems like people here, U.S. getting 3rd shots. wonder it. crossing state line lying. wondering check data base go get vaccinated, see not. immunocompromised spouse would like get 3rd shot. think it‚Äôs going happen soon. 

You‚Äôre wearing good mask I‚Äôm assuming? vaccine make u less infectious even u get virus Could be. y‚Äôall see meme couple too? Cause that‚Äôs definitely go hospital.

And tell bacteria (almost) *only* gain resistance mutations patients exposed antibiotics.

... maybe antibiotic killing weaker bugs, selectively breeding survive new ""harsher"" environment. Reddit ‚Äúcumshot_josh‚Äù make insightful thought provoking comment. There's 2 things drive vaccination rates need overnight:

1) Employers saying vaccine = job, and

2) Health Insurers saying vaccine = pay dime anything remotely related Covid unvaccinated caught Well DC mask mandate, neither Virginia Maryland. Beyond May 17th things felt generally pretty normal London beyond masks inside minimal large sporting events.

Yes, contact tracing would require admit part community, would want THAT. Simply outstanding.

Before anyone says anything I'll point large companies like Apple paying experts ( I'm talking nurse friend high school Facebook ) big money advise decisions like this. I've sat calls.

Adjusted excess deaths 8k. Meanwhile, Canada rich nation 38 million people reported death toll 26k. Incidentally, South Africa's death toll found around 200k even though reported death toll Everybody talks Brazil, India Russia undercounting deaths dramatically, least fairly decent idea many people likely died particular nations whereas country Indonesia countless deaths could fly entirely radar happening isolated villages poor internet lower estimate 2.5 million deaths India added worldwide toll push us way 10.2 million deaths. July 23rd, toll, excess deaths taken account, sub-Saharan Africa supposedly around 300k. talking region population 1.1 billion pandemic first began. Even assuming virus kills 1% humans, infected entire population every country within region 11 million assume 3 million people rather 300 thousand people died sub-Saharan Africa brings death toll 13 million mark, assume 5 million deaths rather 2.5 million deaths India means hit 15 that‚Äôs still bit low take account fact 13% world‚Äôs population vaccinated yet. people vaccinated live rich countries like France. Plus, fast-spreading Delta variant still hospitalize people vaccinated. single shot Pfizer vaccine provides around 36% protection. vaccinated people die covid, still risk long-term symptoms fully Deaths breakthrough covid rare, happen. thing vaccines may lose effectiveness person compromised immune system old speculate final death toll pandemic considered media focuses possibility death, even surviving mild case covid mean going fine afterwards. 25% covid patients deal long covid, afterwards. chances long covid go dramatically vaccinated, given world's population vaccinated still looking serious world health crisis tip iceberg here. even gotten possibility massive famine doomsday scenario one variants' CFR increase dramatically alongside transmissibility. Tokyo Olympics reopening schools fall may accelerate spread 

Even without possibility evading vaccine, covid already likely killed somewhere 8-13 million people could kill millions more. know death toll look like covid manages evade vaccine, make pandemic point look like 2009 Swine Flu comparison. people notice symptoms and/or report covid, cases lot less actually are, know lot people symptoms go daily business, lot unfortunately virus risking many peoples jobs lives... incredible ridiculously selfish people days, little respect anyone close family. regular doctor? prescribe extra shot think need one. I'm dumb Either vaccine works doesn‚Äôt, thing isn‚Äôt going eradicated. hope don‚Äôt continue playing ping pong game decrease spread, spread increases, issue mandates, rinse repeat.. health insurance companies US, especially high deductible, already exclusion lists.

They could add covid list. [my graphic slightly :) Oh take find I‚Äôll look.  anywhere really REQUIRING it? saying either get vaccinated wear masks forever? again, that‚Äôs really requiring it.  That's overly optimistic. Hospital ICU admissions 25% peak still climbing. Cases younger people tend bleed towards older age groups weeks rise cases contained. Cases started fall restrictions reinstated. 2/3 Netherlands fully vaccinated (of quite age group) outbreak began. 

Until sufficient coverage fully vaccinated people, cases good indicator expect hospitals, early let go case numbers yet. two months time would agree. balls she'd grandpa. Gee, wonder Delta variant.... one infect transmit vaccinated individuals.... main strain alpha.

The virus changed, Dr. Faisal Khan, public health director, told her.

The surging virus, fueled contagious Delta variant, led C.D.C. respond guidance harked back year ago, many state local officials imposing mask mandates. Thursday, President Biden expected announce civilian federal employees must vaccinated forced submit regular testing, social distancing, mask requirements travel restrictions.

But months shutdowns three vaccines available protect Americans, trying get people wear face coverings middle long, hot summer encountering defiance hostility.

Four Republican governors, Greg Abbott Texas, Doug Ducey Arizona, Brian Kemp Georgia Pete Ricketts Nebraska, signaled opposition recommendation.

Nine states ‚Äî Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Iowa, Montana, North Dakota, South Carolina, Tennessee Texas ‚Äî already banned limited face mask mandates, leaving cities counties options fight virus spread.

The South Carolina Department Education cited state‚Äôs ban said public schools would adopt C.D.C. mask recommendations.

Even Washington State, tough virus restrictions last year enjoyed substantial public backing, appeared scant support stepped-up masking now.


‚ÄúEverybody access vaccines country moment, think people taking advantage that, it‚Äôs poor personal decision-making,‚Äù said State Senator Mark Mullet, Democrat.

Gov. Jay Inslee, Democrat, urged residents follow federal guidelines announced mask requirements schools would remain. suggested state could require vaccinations eligible students rates increase.

Some states cities moved quickly adopt C.D.C.‚Äôs recommendations. Mayor Quinton Lucas Kansas City, Mo., reinstated mask mandate. Gov. Steve Sisolak Nevada, Democrat, ordered residents counties high rates transmission ‚Äî including Clark County, home Las Vegas ‚Äî wear masks public indoor spaces starting Friday.

The Illinois Department Public Health recommended masks everyone places rampant infections, California, 90 percent state facing substantial high transmission rates, state health officials Wednesday recommended masking public indoor settings, though stopped short mandate.

Private companies, too, moving impose mask rules. MGM Resorts International said would require visitors wear masks indoor public areas beginning Friday. Apple told employees reinstating mask requirement everyone indoors certain U.S. offices, according internal memo obtained New York Times. Apple also announced would require employees customers, regardless vaccination status, wear masks half U.S. stores.

For businesses surge virus cases complicated plans returning workers desks. Google said Wednesday pushing back official return date Oct. 18 September ‚Äî following similar announcement Apple ‚Äî would require returning workers vaccinated.

Los Angeles County first major county revert requiring everyone wear masks indoors public spaces last week.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs inconvenience it‚Äôs annoying,‚Äù said Tina Kim, 40, sat outdoor patio Mexican restaurant Boyle Heights neighborhood Los Angeles Tuesday night. ‚ÄúBut don‚Äôt think reliable way filtering vaccinated walk store. It‚Äôs easier everyone put back on.‚Äù

The C.D.C. recommended people wear masks indoors counties substantial high infection rates, 50 new cases per 100,000 people seven-day period. measure, residents Florida, Arkansas Louisiana wear masks indoors. Nearly two-thirds U.S. counties qualify, many concentrated South.

In counties, rate 300 new cases per 100,000 people, said Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky, C.D.C. director.

The patchwork regulations created confusing landscape masks strictly enforced airplanes, required mostly worn public transportation systems like New York City subway, left completely inside supermarkets, movie theaters gyms much South.

In Florida, never statewide mask mandate seen big rise virus cases hospitalizations, Gov. Ron DeSantis, Republican, made mention C.D.C. guidelines news conference Wednesday. (None officials present outdoor event wore mask.) Last week, reiterated asking people cover faces goes message needed get vaccine.

‚ÄúI get little bit frustrated see jurisdictions saying, ‚ÄòEven you‚Äôre healthy vaccinated, must wear mask we‚Äôre seeing increased cases,‚Äô‚Äù said July 21. ‚ÄúUnderstand message sending people aren‚Äôt vaccinated: It‚Äôs telling vaccines don‚Äôt work. think that‚Äôs worst message send people time.‚Äù

On Wednesday, though, Mayor Daniella Levine Cava announced indoor mask requirement county-operated facilities Miami-Dade County strong recommendation masks large crowds close spaces. ‚ÄúWe come far,‚Äù said. ‚ÄúWe sacrificed much past almost year-and-a-half. cannot turn back now.‚Äù

Most recent friction face coverings Florida centered whether require masks schools, last school year. Mr. DeSantis adamant opposition: Monday, held private discussion friendly panelists uniformly idea, including one insisted masking children amounted ‚Äúabuse.‚Äù

[...] go get it. Rather hyperbolic you. Watch interview Face Nation last Sunday get explanation. 
 
Essentially waves length time everywhere world. Regionally know wave starts predict end. There‚Äôs magic, nothing nonsensical, prediction. region started get hit, it‚Äôs different story. you‚Äôre region peaking now. 100% this. want life back think made recommendation honor system wasn‚Äôt working. much risk breakthrough cases huge factor transmission.

Easier ask everyone wear mask instead relying people honest vaccination status. Less half people Texas vaccinated, guess many wearing masks?

Also makes sense higher breakthrough cases probability transmission would higher. think claim viral load identical unvaccinated people dubious, bet set extreme anecdotes.

I‚Äôm virologist physician, isn‚Äôt reducing viruses ability replicate infect cells purpose vaccine? viral load vaccinated vs unvaccinated wouldn‚Äôt course illness similar breakthrough cases?

Also even it‚Äôs true, sneezing, coughing, rubbing snotty nose place chance transmission lower. UK much higher vaccine rate Florida, plus restrictions don‚Äôt remember one, get reversed twice?? might feel flummoxed official proclaiming wave pass ‚Äúxxx weeks‚Äù, truth is, leading epidemiologists seeing (Osterholm &amp; Slavitt made similar statements), thing moving across locations waves, often without clear indication driving rates aside people seeing wind blows &amp; starting alter behaviors. 

Our way net seems peaks &amp; valleys wide spread vaccination &amp; focus vaccination across globe.   1918 working already 12, 15 married, 18 least 1 kid family.  Hell YEAH!!! Average daily hospital admissions among 18-39 year olds Florida jumped 150% past two weeks record-shattering rate, exceeded nationally young-adults‚Äô surge New Mexico last year,

Some good news. Well I'm embarrassed remember that. feel penance watch whole series over. can, it‚Äôs much less likely, less dangerous. people currently hospitalized Covid, 1% vaccinated, 75% 1% older 65 illnesses. aware breakthrough cases possible, don‚Äôt lose sleep it.  count three legal victories (that know of), two Federal lawsuits colleges Federal hospital case, zero losses.

Yea, agree businesses started realize this. example Facebook Google decided today? think.

800 hospitals stared require mandates.
 fix one go.

Free meet greet garth get shot. Boom 20k people vaccinated.  two published studies vaccine efficacy show little difference Delta Alpha zero impact hospitalization severe illness. No. really true. far ""click bait"" possible.

-Nationals reached 85% threshold among players staff fully vaccinated

-A large portion team/staff believed vaccinated J&amp;J

-MLB policy longer regularly tests vaccinated players, unvaccinated

-Trea Turner tested positive likely feeling fine (played first inning) pulled positive test

-Manager comments seem imply Turner unvaccinated 

-Subsequent testing results 3 players 8 staff (12 total) testing positive 

-Overall seems outbreak among unvaccinated J&amp;J vaccinated personnel 

-Outbreak likely produce symptoms enough among hardly anyone positives found contact tracing 

-No one reported ‚Äúreally, really ill‚Äù brilliant decision, reckless far right libertarian nonsense decision based science. likely result new vaccine defeating variant UK blamed for. 

UK chance flatten Delta curve masks restrictions instead went way. going turn hope. Georgetown indoor masks roll back mask mandate safe so.

We simply bug trying thin. 

Corona stay, vaccines ( fully vaxxed Pfizer person ) mean wasn‚Äôt latest thinking time CDC said them? Things change. I‚Äôm sure understand complaint. Also, states lower vaccine rates definitely leading surge. Panera Bread FL. Again, one lawsuit getting thrown pretty meaningless. Currently around 4% businesses requiring vaccination, 45% nurses vaccinated. wary pushing stuff far, settlements types lawsuits ridiculous. 


I say someone vaccinated weeks Tell people already vaccinated dead.

Nothing 100% stop Covid. key difference SARS-CoV-2 smallpox virus animal reservoirs samllpox virus. humans infected SARS-CoV-2, animals too. even vaccinate entire world 100% there's always chance animal bring variant right back circulation. 

The campaign Smallpox Zero began 1950s helm World Health Organization remarkably impressive scope. essentially vaccinate nearly everyone low-income world. soon new outbreak detected vaccinated secondary contacts. However, helped fact people contagious symptoms showed. 

It literally virus earth we've managed completely drive extinction. Viruses insanely difficult get rid of. MD tells it‚Äôs big deal shoot crotch .44, believe shoot self?

The CDC whole staff MDs say mask up, thats I'm doing...but think dismiss says hand. Perhaps dismiss considering it, that's reasonable. COVID definitely really bad, people claiming I'm doomsayer past too. 

I'm upset media culture basically consistently acting first vaccine push thing capable doing, this, there's hope. 

Social measures go long way towards fighting virus. really upsetting see attitude ""I'm vaccinated, I'm done.""  
The virus really dangerous, people underestimating way personal responsibility stop spread virus. vaccines enough, still practice responsibility been.

I think media focus vaccines thing needed done going turn damaging. Well, maybe use data move FDA along. say wanted see data points. Let's go. Since mid-May I've operating policy someone asks put mask I'm indoors, will. mean anyone, even stranger sitting near me. keep one times.

Nobody has. ZERO people. I've even started forget bring one times (though current spread I'm going carry one religiously) since one seems care real world.

People loud vocal online tend quiet puppies real life. good. Rite Aid made appointment too. number email listed appointment. First time flying since pandemic. see airline's website state masks valves allowed. actually enforce that? studies since saying masks valves offer protection others don't.

Anyone traveled airplanes wearing mask valve chime in? Oh sorry, personal opinion based study. like ""should"" based science study. thinking city 1 mil people, got lot people going stores, eating out, etc. choices stores restaurants, probably likely go different ones week, therefore spreading virus around more. thought would make sense bigger cities implement something instead nothing. think managers think butt chair, person attached butt ""producing value"".  hate Tom Scott? Science nuanced. Here's report cited data last days, still unpublished, taken 100 samples vaccinated unvaccinated individuals COVID infections. found amount virus noses throats vaccinated infected people nearly ""indistinguishable"" found unvaccinated people

Logically would follow viral load similar someone unvaccinated would infectious. absence challenge trials time collect real world data contact tracing that's good evidence going get. likely future mutations similar current strains original wild type? Delta variant better controlled vaccine designed 16 months ago typical Flu strain controlled vaccine developed 4 5 months flu season.

Coronaviruses mutate slower flu viruses, flu basically ""solved"" societal level yearly updates vaccines.

The doom-mongering coming media public officials, well-intentioned trying convince people take vaccines, seriously damaging morale among ""the choir"", fail convince skeptics anyway. messaging continue getting vaccine protects personally (which does) , vaccines brink failing anyway (which not). Yes. Exactly. need cursory glance sub see Pfizer, specifically, pushing really hard sell idea need boosters. isn't, mainly, coming scientists, academics governmental health agencies. conspiracy say main motive behind public health.

Finally, find really ironic company simply admitting informing, going public loudest terms every chance possible say product good expected. Pfizer went ""our vaccine miraculous deed nearly 100% efficiency"" ""alright guys, might need third dose"" minute contracts signed.  dont know train started. blame medical field per se, I'd blame media/social media current cultural attitudes.

That said, medical field disappoint bit recent actions, understand driven fear/fatigue.... also concern.  Okay haha, making sure. also completely agree you. Measure twice Correct. contagious, disease isn‚Äôt worse catch it. One quibble here. would experts CDC considered ‚Äúpeer review‚Äù? vaccine fully protect people extremely strong immune systems either. helps though. Would guys travel kid 5 covid world? She‚Äôs exposed daycare‚Ä¶. Covid never going eradicated. don‚Äôt want exposed covid you‚Äôll likely need get vaccinated every year. Seems like good situation put foot down, hurt feelings damned. might shock you, media often reports news way sensationalist frightening possible, make people click more. nice day, now. would go another bar. Fair enough! concede point blame head CDC instead. I‚Äôve definitely primed insanely irresponsible media coverage last six years lol. imbeciles prematurely declared vaccinated people take precautions anymore go back say exact opposite wonder idiots trust science. tell trust read platform without telling trust read platform Wow, even fourth dose. one vaccinated people world. Well then, I'm glad got tested visiting anti-vax family even though I'm fully vaccinated. turns fact trying protect mask supply.

Well go then. CDC say masks useful. I'm confused bringing incident. World:

Texas: *Look me... shithole country now.* People ICU tested they're vaccinated? Efficacy disease dropped 95 86% four months. Also noted vaccine used reference study vaccine available US. Well bit hastily me, see lots people focus solely Corona forgetting many dies flu. reddit country US. Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Atlanta, Miami, New Orleans, Houston, Kansas City. pretty good idea. tried many masks none work me. certain point, decided Id spent enough money masks. ended using gaiters fulfill requirement breath still passed fabric less blowing face. bit hard compare directly due nature illnesses.

The actual start data reporting muddled since state sort thing, reporting early Jan/Feb 2020. data (of states reporting) total number pediatric infections point **roughly 4,126,570**. cases, there's **roughly 350** confirmed pediatric deaths covid-19 now.

For comparison, October 1, 2019 April 4, 2020 flu resulted **195 pediatric deaths**. Unfortunately, know pediatric infection rates flu estimate since flu data tracked way. did, could compare covid-19 flu much uniform way, mostly numbers game data have.

In vacuum, flu much dangerous children, however regularity along prep work done yearly vaccines education takes much edge off. example flu benefit protections, look H1N1. cause **358 pediatric deaths** April 2009 September 2010, number covid-19 reaching almost year half in.  I'm one 2 5 body choice. think unvaccinated people allowed lot things pandemic over. concerts, weddings, visiting hospitals, even indoor dining restaurants. time could give whole laundry list things *could* happen. aren‚Äôt true. lot things *could* happen don‚Äôt. absolutely still poke people. folks like refuse take care reason we're nowhere close universal healthcare. politically financially.  Lol posted one line clearly says ready right moment. It‚Äôs ok you‚Äôre wrong. gym mask mandate per health ministry, take care anymore. vaccined gym show QR get information from? hard answer one question? deny everyone presents info you, get information from? Health department still can. guys basically admitting wear masks public spaces die?

No? kind mental gymnastics this? wear masks public spaces finally safe so. simple. Forget appointed him. What‚Äôs coming mouth makes sense amount medical credentials make make sense. 

‚ÄúYeah delta variant lot contagious let‚Äôs start taking proven precautions help control spread anything like I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll go away two three weeks.‚Äù

If MD tells it‚Äôs big deal shoot crotch .44, believe shoot self? anti Vax, medical things mandatory non medical Fields... That's slippery slope.  sample size 100? got kidding me.

Right? That's enough apply CLT theorem consider close enough normal distribution! small sample discredit? really make sense.  says whatever al time, accountability We‚Äôll get boosters. human , enjoy  preprint 100 person study India, vaccines don‚Äôt even use, doesn‚Äôt really confirm much anything US dare report news! It‚Äôs important thing said important source story.

Covid test came back negative couple days. far I'm aware of, Covid. Remember could 'poke' people Facebook? bring back vaccination campaign.  Good bot Israel's Health Ministry's team experts recommends 3rd dose COVID-19 vaccine older population.

I think site I‚Äôm getting board mask-choice crowd. want wear mask office every god damn day. office requires it, I‚Äôll need reconsider job guess.   Antibodies vaccine proven pass brrastmilk though. Lactating women get vaccinated. took pfizer yesterday expected it‚Äôs making bit sick feel really weak. wanna play video games lol counteract feeling ‚Äústay bed day‚Äù issue comes less government. don‚Äôt trust government, reason to, constantly given scary reasons reinforce distrust.

As commoner, hear different messages. told White House press secretary don‚Äôt need know important information, going ‚Äúmisinformation campaign,‚Äù hear censorship information gets nervous.

The people telling know related information demanding faith Science, ultimately them. seem want state approval research papers make sure fits whatever standard is.

If nothing else, many things we‚Äôve demonized (by government) conspiracy theories coming true. president calling unvaccinated straight stupid. 

I‚Äôm vaccinated, totally understand unvaccinated coming I'm telling slipper slope fallacy there's slope slip down. assumption CDC reported yesterday unpublished study showing infected vaccinated people equal amounts virus unvaccinated people nose throat. may indicate similar infectiousness. know understand fallacy works. analogy.

If made argument masking required long covid *exists* conclusion would follow, one saying that. truth probably lot sinister average American handle, need sugar coat data released. people knew county governments would likely go bankrupt soon people stop paying property taxes.

A little known fact 08 crash city Vallejo. CA. bay area generally lower income. city actually went legitimately bankrupt, word started getting everyone contractors property owners decided stiff city payments. Spiraled control bad could afford police use security guards respond 911 calls. 

This happen somewhere America soon point damage controls. amount stimulus replace bad city budgets get delayed payments everything. anyone think delta surge going happen due antibody dependent enhancement (ADE)? Countries high vaccination rates experienced surge cases. Thoughts? Rolling loud last weekend. Let‚Äôs see numbers Ok clears things up. terms equally infectious, confirmed data still hypothesis? argument lol, breaking news a. reporter. wait tomorrow I'll show article including fact, Twitter problem.

No compelling argument meet goalpost abandoned soon addressed though.

I think going win Supreme Court lol. pretty much slam dunk. Read many articles posted interested understanding why. last Wednesday 54 000 cases? Yea perfectly healthy surviving Covid without vaccine baby works point, fuck it. wear masks already probably vaccinated. oppose likely unvaccinated. Nothing going change mind. Many going needlessly die. move wave. wave hopefully last. made appointment CVS tomorrow morning. see happens. doubt ask many questions around here. good. Young people definetly one least vaccinated demographics. 

They're probably also worried getting canceled. hope big venues follow suit. CDC's position they're fully vaccinated need boosters yet. I've seen doctors come recommend boosters. Yeah weekend bumbers monday typically much lower everywhere across board. 38k 3 days sign bad news come least think so. Someone know massive migraines, chest tightness. know means though. entitled think that, fellow free thinker! post little hard understand I'll summarize reported. 100 samples taken nose throat vaccinated unvaccinated people COVID infections. viral yield (amount virus) similar vaccinated unvaccinated infections. hypothesis equally infectious result. distinguish vaccine types announcement. data yet published may learn is. heh, made appointment CVS tomorrow morning see get done. Pretty sure going check much here. aunt stones she'd uncle infant getting really sick rare yes dying rare. know infant rsv hospitalized, pull through. astrazeneca Pfizer combo told get fact lol hopefully that's magic bullet! like everyone's mad side believe Covid vaccinations willing let die stupidity ignorance. Maybe I'm wrong. Yeah refusal get vaccinated wear masks dates back least Spanish flu era. obviously USA global.

Don't answer get cooperation masks, vaccination. 
Give $$$ euro whatever currency used. Money talks free box Krispy cream slim lottery chance, working.
Another thing mask wearing is, enforcement. would voluntary. Cannot ask staff risk injury death + majority Leo enforce. I‚Äôd love say fuck unvaccinated but, take care someone elderly conditions. It‚Äôs new way living on. They‚Äôre trading already? know you‚Äôre pointing name calling avoid addressing point I‚Äôm pretty sure started name calling ‚Äúpresumptive dick‚Äù, get high horse. philosophy don‚Äôt understand basic formal logic, wonder drive Uber. incredible bad CDC messaging. government please force people get vaccinated? Whats super annoying pointed work, always retort. if, personal gain folks get vaccinated wear masks. Yes. that's good thing long run, first shot folks may waited wee bit late. going weeks protection full strengths shot #1.

Anyway, least trying ao criticize them. swear within hour CDC announcement masks k-12 recommend, neighboring county's school districts announced going mandate masks anyone. certainly time 5pm news cycle. makes sense you‚Äôd reply specifically comments. also directed can't take kinds things granted.

There plenty ways frame generally. don‚Äôt even disagree you. respect, please go poop someone else‚Äôs doorstep. times crisis, yeah, kind of. Yeah data J&amp;J real world slow trickle phase 1/2 trials looked like immune response still building two months. would love see data longer term efficacy, Delta. two data sets released concerning Delta contradictory neither one focused actual real-world outcomes J&amp;J. first jabs though? Which, cool, that's full vaccination. Even full vaccination mean 100% immune. Also still leaves fact people gotten jab, ones can't health reasons. take many incubator. 

The current vaccines also slightly less effective new variants. mean, cram like sardines pubs dance clubs spit other's mouth want guess; numbers climb. Isn‚Äôt anyone worried health effects? fully vaccinated completely exposed husband tested positive despite vaccinated never tested positive got sick, unlike him. don‚Äôt know prescribing 3rd doses everyone high risk people. pretty stupid stuff, aggressively stupid government health advisors fully captured them.

Everything open, people want stay way, who's asking extra stuff like quarantine requirements test positive? tempting fate. like what, three months since Alberta worst caseloads country? Things might be, hopefully fine, denying information need know patently ignorant going variants years. Get used it. I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs effective. People hate told do- especially that‚Äôs excercise healthy eating US Jewish population hit 100% vaccinated. y‚Äôall expect us get word whether Moderna recipients need boosters? Average percentage, total number vaccinated individuals. vaccinated people states people. Delta changed rules, also Lambda variant deck ready make rounds.

It's going superspreader extravaganza regardless vaccination status. little coverage long haul covid medical bills. Hospitals denying covid coverage important long haul recovery visits like physical therapy. top this, many hospitals still budget issues hiring staff relieve workers. worst American medical system exposed covid, elder care facilities. Give everybody 2 weeks get vaccinated.

Then start loading darts shoot attack helicopters. problem state leadership South. Even level headed worked vaccinated called CDC this. Hopefully, prudent. Y: Last Man except men die, become sterile Boosters would developed effective new variants, means newer first doses would also better new variants. Booster development mean ignoring unvaccinated. paper see many cases. people getting COVID Florida predominantly COVID deniers, antivaxxers, people think COVID test swabs carcinogenic. bottom barrel humans going go get tested symptoms exposed unless admitted hospital even they'll probably refuse test intubated choice. situation, though, they‚Äôre far overly exposed Covid influenza. percentages may similar, total case count expected higher.  driven rise Delta cases natural degradation? study see said viral load impacted vaccine? would change fact vaccinated people significantly less likely moderate severe symptoms? What?! mayor literally declared state emergency county today (Orange County/Orlando). quite definitely worried hospital capacity. absolutely source saying. question hate me

Is virus keep mutating finds way? asked Doc that. said aren‚Äôt testing children (especially young ours) unless symptoms present. 1 year old even fever last fall wouldn‚Äôt test 3 days. coming extremely vaxxed liberal area. I‚Äôm sure could find pharmacy it, Docs aren‚Äôt recommending point, think we‚Äôll hold off. Undergrad med students don‚Äôt live spaces attend classes workplace people refuse get vaccinated. Ok, well please wear mask. refuse wear mask. Yet supposed treat utmost respect kindness, don‚Äôt make smallest effort try protect others. Kids hospitalized ventilators ""good"" thing?

Jesus. Yes good thing **that dying**. intentionally dense attempt take moral high ground. what's long term studies Covid-19 kids show? Say 5-10 50 years now?

There study, course. long term covid effects kids purely conjecture. flu.

You're right. know **very similar** 'long effects' flu? Yet covid run around shaming people wearing masks fear flu we? think we‚Äôll hear clarification next couple days. Clevelan Clinic found necessary get vaccine already virus Technically could since I‚Äôve known people snuck 3rd dose walking local pharmacy claiming first dose. mileage risk may vary since it‚Äôs officially approved. 38k total sa, su, mo. 

They longer report weekends, get artificial 3x bump week. Grim? Sign world anyone bother read article? get little data demanding third shot? data, involved tests 23 people, yet peer-reviewed clear boosted antibody levels actually correlate better protection, extra protection even needed. US Centers Disease Control Prevention says current vaccines protect people well common variants. GOP throwing mud CDC &amp; govt attempts contain virus (‚Äúwhich it? masks work don‚Äôt, vaccines work oe don‚Äôt‚Äù) base sickens does. country. Man would dream come true many followed Texas' mask mandate anyway. literally huge thrive expo Fort Worth ONE wearing mask.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* much less likely get infected vaccinated US made get vaccine twice. pfizer gets 2nd pfizer. Moderna gets 2nd moderna. CDC needs knock scare tactics damaging public confidence vaccines.

Is CDC people writing headlines, intentionally taking things context, using ""scare tactics?"" Good bot almost like he's employee CDC... come go people get vaccinated. Every working epidemiologist tell lasting herd immunity without vaccination.  Never been. don‚Äôt blame people giving orders then? Businesses can't ignore local mandates, city says restaurants require masks that's it.

But point city says masks required government buildings, makes lot easier business say also require masks since precedence poiint to.

yes, could always required ones risked losing customers. city it, people would accepting.

That's exact reason policies actual talking points matter comes governance. wish Japanese government IOC stubborn cancellations, locals like safer, without many people many countries around world congregating one location.

Good luck screening; hope goes well! Delta less deadly. are. Bold assumption. It‚Äôs Florida, expect? Surprise!! really antimask. Masks proven effective flu allergies wearing regularly rest life winter spring. time, time mask mandates over. virus transmissible smallpox asymptomatic transmission going eradicated using masks. focus masks largely result mass hysteria. way reduce human suffering point (a) authorize vaccine 2-12 introduce vaccine mandates. prerequisite also FDA fully approve vaccine. what's idiotic take this?

I say idiotic commented like 7 times comment section one downvoted oblivion. good one. OP, [I think maybe mean RSV Record-breaking numbers people treated Christchurch Hospital including spike children highly contagious Respiratory Syncytial flux lead urgent change hospital visits ban children seeing hospital's emergency department experienced ""massive increase"" patients 70 day children suffering RSV ""very unwell people"", staff dealing injuries skiing icy situation mirrored across country hospitals postponing surgeries creating extra bed space children deal sharp surge RSV.

And RSV spiking US Canada well. Thank informative comment. 

I'm sure qualifications are, want ask: 
Do think possible RSV infection could also provide kind ""cross-immunity"" Covid19? 

RSV prevalent Florida supposedly much southeastern US recently, know got work even though masked up. 

Although think cross-immunity existed, Florida's case numbers exploding right now. Alt media, GOP conspiracy nutters done job Americans.

It‚Äòs contagion, miasma spread Canada well. Mon Dieu! 


Our illustrious leader build Wall US pay it. too. 
""Fuck study Israel!"" said loudly. COVID-19 *antibody* test *not* test presence COVID-19. 

And antibody test came back positive, congratulations--your vaccine exactly intended do! better leave house then, dozens ways could potentially die --COVID one them. 

A 0.5% chance dying Delta vaccinated ""fucking high."" people die every day heart disease America COVID point. 

Feel free wear mask forever 0.5% daunting. rest us ready move lives.  shame VIRUS AIN'T END ALL!! mother 2 wait 4 hours ambulance due chest pains. 75. heart attack Cornwall (Bodmin)ambulance service (at least) DEAD GOOD ENOUGH üá¨üáß ‚ùó‚ùó‚ò†Ô∏è  üòÇ got comment? I'm defending paper read it, however rejection invalidate research. might bad research rejected journals, might need change something take time review process allows, might fit scope journal, might significant enough finding certain high impact journals, number reasons. Speaking someone bad case Covid despite fully vaccinated, masks help vaccinated too. Nope it. masked social distanced year. Got shots available me. I'm going back morons want 'do research'. Cull stupid, literally care anymore. I'm vaccinated masking year, I'm totally done.

Tell again, inconvenience way unvaccinated?

If get sick, problem, 0% serious cases hospitalizations coming vaccinated population.  may popular opinion sort give props UK govt sticking re-opening timeline despite alarmists calling doomsday scenario. put trust folks able decide vaccinate themselves, seem gotten enough vaccinated cases declining despite delta variant reopening. Based descriptions/symptoms I‚Äôve long covid half life. understand meaning.

The answer less 0.5%. words almost one vaccinated dies COVID-19. mean people die.

But die often COVID-19.

Here

**Italy says 99% COVID deaths since Feb fully US 650,000 deaths COVID-19. many vaccinated according Centers Disease Control Prevention, rate severe breakthroughs exceedingly low: July 19, CDC received reports 5,914 COVID-19-related hospitalizations deaths 161 million fully vaccinated people United States. 

Do division me. 5,900/650,000 new varient creates larger systemic impacts. health might fine, everything else be. ship sailed


Too bad people even known delta variant folks India. don‚Äôt care whether care not. say nonsensical. stated ‚Äúthis new variant targeting young people‚Äù. know ‚Äútargeting‚Äù means? Obviously not. 

If said something like ‚Äúit appears may severe disease associated delta variant‚Äù‚Ä¶that‚Äôd reasonably accurate (not fully vetted), instead make sound like virus targeting young healthy groups. Guess what, it‚Äôs targeting anyone particular. User base? Yeah. Launching basically chat/email mix service wasn‚Äôt monumental 2004 tech. Probably conflating vaccine cure watching many movies.

Fucking asshats. OMG everything either bad good would dump weekend backlog Wednesday?

Reliable epidemiological data meant that, 111 transmission events, donor recipient cases known.¬† And? take random Reddit comments gospel. ‚ÄúThere past future, present party always right.‚Äù he‚Äôs far stretch absolutely nothing. it‚Äôs ideal situation doesn‚Äôt mean progress hasn‚Äôt made. Bulldozing little land? Florida mostly empty land. mean ""born everyday""? US - - fact world - - large scale demographic decline years now; replacement. appears little evidence delta variant leading higher incidence breakthrough cases - is, incidence hospitalization death appear same. 

So, no, really. chance vaccinated family member getting sick hasn‚Äôt changed since April. I‚Äôm going personally oppose reinstatement mask mandates, follow whatever laws store rules place. don‚Äôt mind masks all, still wear one higher-risk locations. oppose changing laws affect entire population protect selfish protect - especially unvaccinated likely won‚Äôt listen mandates anyways.

My wife getting tested tomorrow, testing sites area booked today, pediatric office wouldn‚Äôt test us daughter. We‚Äôre fully vaxxed always wear masks outside house, wife exhibiting mild COVID symptoms.

Guess what? youre always gonna get ""infected"", long virus air, get exposed it. happens next matters discussions. immune system kill virus develops symptoms, get sick? 

Heres interesting take ive watched recently dr fauci subject various grades successes among extrovert fuck shit!

This directly ongoing preprint study linked Hill. Lol, new ride option vaxxed driver premium.  likely due vaccines disproportionately high elderly vs young Curious bad experience Covid 1 J&amp;J shot? Covid symptoms blunted, least? serious consequences ignorance, selfishness, blatant stupidity. people took space classroom point doesn‚Äôt mean teachable learned anything. Look now, ignorant adults world literally carry unlimited access information pockets. imagine must like students. Yikes. Sadly, yes, work one places lot antivaxx crying anonymous forums, read metaphorical popcorn hand. I‚Äôm provider see lot post-covid pts. 

 3 biggest long haul symptoms see brain fog (people literally can‚Äôt jobs brain won‚Äôt compute- like accountant can‚Äôt account), fatigue (like fall asleep multiple times day like 90 y/o, sit couch minute), heart palpitations. 
People overall seem worried palpitations. 
Personally, first 2 would worry most. Yes, reacting. virus mutates evade vaccines, means hunker modify it.

And yes, probably naught, mean fucked up. know, precautions prevented and/or loved ones getting sick, getting long COVID, and/or dying.

Unfortunately, many fucking idiots are, seem heading back towards square 1. leave Florida man this! absolutely get irritated told still worry also told vaccines provide incredible amount protection. Reports recently nearly completely protects hospitalization, completely close enough. 

It's tiring quite frankly. really asinine? Maybe biased held view I'm starting think governments realizing whole containing virus procedures held place really anything long run... requiring quarantine easing mask mandates quite literally waiving white flag letting virus run course. ""Recommending someone stay home"" different flu cold handled. Yes, pineapple hopefully  never are. fact idea pretending.

Much less pretending fly play harp time. 

I barely handle piano even I'm bolted floor. Seems good. Right, that‚Äôs new information. Cough palm.  love shits runny, thank much. Everyone covid fatigue wanted open up. Pre Delta agreed, don't. imagine higher level vaccination really trigger reopen. Could incentivisced like ""let's get 75% we'll reopen!"" kind symptoms? care. think urged vaccinations one day last week leopards promtly ate face sold anti-vaccine merch hand. mean wouldn‚Äôt point low case numbers evidence success since high 2-3 months likely. 

Not saying support lockdowns/mask mandates bc don‚Äôt. partner also done everything right last year half. willingly expose people I'm sick I'm done letting government involved health. When/if booster necessary I'll take it. Sure, I'll child stay home daycare indefinitely wife go work. hope so, too. Eventually probably will, least mRNA ones Novavax. It‚Äôs understandable less exposure. head CDC Dr. Fauci need shut truck one two days row. don‚Äôt think intentionally mean contradict it. talking complex items multiple answers get that. Still it‚Äôs confusing hell. got somebody CDC hire publicist press secretary maybe could charge small fee $100/yr people want get vaccinated, medical reason to. say way punish them. source revenue given immunocompromised people, funds stay home get services like grocery delivery. 

there may problem far medical privacy. maybe give tax rebate choose prove vaccinated. 

this seems like fair reasonable compromise. people trust vaccine forced take it. potentially harm easily avoid exposure. True. Continuing talk negatives undermining it. Every idiot sun already undermining it. Like geez, hard talk positives while. swear everyone less 30 brain cells wants parrot negative blurb hear vaccines. Super annoying I'd call lucky. people lucky. I'd angry still unvaccinated can‚Äôt, job essentially 10 hours, time raise puppy. imma keep going sh√Øt, I‚Äôm vaccinated I‚Äôll take risk.  note patients pay $10 virtual prescription. actual cost test passed insurance government.

I got test twice part research study. also got T-cell test different study, get results still research test.  make choice worry. I'll take booster shot I'm done anything else. ""As rare are"" - tell us rare actual data, Walensky. Link please. 44% efficacy real world.

Would vaccines approved now? thought 50% minimum fair court, student excuse valid since disallowed mandates everywhere. goal students, limited schools. agree. They're talking entire patient population 145 right now.

And 'boom boxed' people afraid US taken vaccine feel even afraid build excuse keep getting protection.

Great boombox. Rapid tests feasible. government needs allow people make cheaper tests (under $5). daily tests, weekly opportunistic testing potential exposure totally do-able. European asian countries people locked unless day go out. leave house unless shop day. hour.

And many countries reimbursed well. believe EU gave 80 percent salary anybody.  understanding federal government paying covid treatment insurance doesnt. free, assuming pay federal taxes, healthcare financial burden anyone going comment said fuck it‚Ä¶ flying blind people, vaccine don‚Äôt fucking moron. 90% sterilizing.

And vaccines development hopes sterilizing immunity. minimum goal disease prevention. quite though...really high compliance rates areas, schools. Point people mask going masking local school business mandates.... Governor simply nothing and, even worse, encourage people defy mandates... getting benefit mandates lower state infection numbers. don‚Äôt know tell you. referring study. know studies, UK, shown different results, study shows shows. I‚Äôm saying study definitive, absolutely not, dismissed either. must look data types studies comparison analysis. Didn‚Äôt Rochelle Walensky say 
long ago vaccinated people can‚Äôt carry virus? I'm guy, I'll jump say first point right. Taking precautions reduces frequency severity covid infections. (Cause viral load...) Masking improves clinical outcomes positive cases.

I think somewhat premature. evidence flu vaccine protects covid extremely preliminary, bit irresponsible say stronger statement.

The author's conclude ""we promote flu vaccine reduce burden covid"" (I suspect) they're cost benefit analysis. benefit might large, might small, might nothing, *very* uncertain. However, cost (acknowledging they've determined flu vaccine increase covid severity) vanishingly small. So, author's conclude *with high confidence* giving flu vaccine promoted, despite (possibly) *very low confidence* idea flu vaccine protects covid.

There's contradiction I'm saying. correct statement right seems ""we know flu vaccine protects covid, might, make things worse, get it"". meta analysis review comes out, medical institution starts saying stronger statement, lay people say anything stronger. think often discussions surrounding COVID focus death rate.

Ultimately respiratory disease sends high volume adults (and kids) health care network.

Vaccinations, even lower effectiveness variants mutations, still ease burden created illness hospitals.

The burden local health networks drives mask mandates lockdowns.

I think lot us take healthcare networks granted. Nurses healthcare workers quit sizeable numbers throughout this, isn‚Äôt unlimited resource we‚Äôre guaranteed access to. 83,000 per day like 5-6 percent state's population getting covid week.

Isn't exactly expect vaccination rates low restrictions lifted taken seriously? seen anything indicates that.

Please link it. thread started someone decided ""throw out"" number 64. nothing linked all.

It probably fear inducing read '64' make true.

But. simply saying ""looks like anymore"" make true either. Quarantine achieve enough herd immunity everyone getting vaccinated theoretically eradicate thing. problem half population protected growing like crazy among half. found way, enough idiots refusing get vaccinated we‚Äôre still hospital-flooding outbreaks.

Anyone, vaccinated not, heart attack/car accident/etc. need hospital. it‚Äôs everyone‚Äôs best interest make sure hospitals aren‚Äôt flooded.

So either idiots need get vaccinated, masks need go back on. Given it‚Äôs hard force people former, we‚Äôre going latter. oh get it, really do, I'm frustrated too. I'm happy we're getting advice least feel like trust. Science changes.

Yeah. term vaccine completely preventing infection ""sterilizing immunity"". vast majority vaccines history vaccines provide sterilizing immunity. vaccines respiratory viruses do. example vaccine does, find, HPV vaccine.

I'm absolutely delighted fair say idea caused this. UK cases skyrocketing two weeks ago 90%+ antibody numbers. Nobody know caused go increasing 50% week suddenly dropping 40% week. Kind shows bad things people get vaccinated secret, instead unvaccinated hiding status. unvaxxed pretty much gonna opposite whatever say plan whole day sleeping rest That‚Äôs sweet think detainees die shady facilities get burial. 0.6% vaccinated participants exposed SARS-CoV-2 rates concentrations higher general population developed least one post-covid symptom. vaccinated, wear mask times high transmission best avoid unvaccinated people, fine Unfortunately Nature article bit misleading. look linked pre-print, clearly states viral load **on first day detection** \~1000x higher likely due fact Delta variant seems reproduce faster host. get steeper rise viral load see first day positive PCR test. linked pre-print:

""We next evaluated viral load measurements **at time SARS-CoV-2 first detected PCR** subject.  relative viral loads cases infected  Delta variant (n=62, Ct =24.00  ORF1ab gene, IQR 19.00\~29.00)  1260 times higher   2020 infections  clade 19A/19B viruses (n=63, Ct = 34.31 ORF1ab gene, IQR 31.00\~36.00) **on day viruses first detected** (Figure 1d).

So problem accelerates spread virus quite bad Nature article makes seem. Yes da Olympics!! Good you! Got second today. Scientists good scientific communication, work spend writing papers presenting conferences, etc. essential skill can't get far without.

But translation - dumbing science general public. different skill regular communication.

Once they're talking *source control* \- stopping outbound emission. agree cloth masks effective stopping outbound spread (which they're much effective everyone wearing one). question many inbound particles block.

this one things thats annoyed pandemic,.. impatience. People seem act like TikTok video 30min comedy show nearly tied finished. cares?? Hospitalisations among vaccinated extremely low. I‚Äôm going mask again. sound rude, comparison many world's previous viruses/bacterial infections, Covid quite minimal especially younger population. ya get Covid news sub you‚Äôll assume delta virus kill four times many folks died plague would think ""here's magic potion get hospitalized die pandemic virus"" would enough motivation everybody. Facebook launched wasn‚Äôt really much.. Yet sub filled people freaking saying they‚Äôll defiant new cdc guidelines. wonder ""experts"" questioned last change. damn well have. Dang live? It‚Äôs pretty red everywhere cdc politically motivated, scientifically motivated. even consult fauci deciding announce mask policy. instated hoping would encourage people get vaccinated, actually right choice. believe ignoring fauci health experts stopping tracking breakthrough cases result hospitalization, google it. openly available information. 

this cdc told us masks help prevent spread (it - wanted protect mask supply) told us okay remove masks (it - knew variants circulating population would remain vulnerable people vaccinated, hoping would make people get shot). making decisions based *want* people do, based science. never removed mask mandate begin with, know it. much hate FB, ‚Äúa hours get going‚Äù bullshit Aw HELL no. cdc website 5900 169 million. vaccines distributed internationally way ensured equal access countries ready administer them, simply sold highest bidder (the wealthiest countries). would reduce likelihood profitable deadly variants requiring booster shots billions developed countries. pandemics fade. 1918 flu, even bubonic plague lasted couple years flared up‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs lots people who‚Äôve predicted 16 last two stock market crashes. doctors right. They‚Äôre early. Covid stay nd never end. UK already seeing huge drops cases delta surge. see next weeks well. endemic point going live like flu. Every year may need booster shot. already need vaccines go school university, travel countries. It‚Äôs really big deal it‚Äôs bloody shot medical procedure. novel concept vaccine. kind necessary absurd ""fully vaccinated people need mask up"" honor system almost entirely ineffective. Unless get glowing holographic emojis heads, never going practically enforceable. 

I also suspect unspoken part reasoning behind recommendation help annoy unvaxed getting shots. also annoy vaccinated annoying unvaxed getting shots (not need help front). 

On actually-vaccinated people side, I'm less convinced necessity (but think reasons alone justify it). 

If really look actual odds scarier looking effectiveness percentages usually discussed, still really well vaccine right now. They're effective tons previous vaccines able less eradicate diseases. 

If vaccinated, unlikely catch Delta, catch unlikely spread it, get sick unlikely hospitalized. still good enough vaccine would \*alone* enough stop people became vaccinated (which leads back first two points).

Gov Stitt piece Shit see things different mandating medical procedure law access private domestic services? see potential abuse here? path leads? Gotcha. probably misunderstood. think two finish lines remaining US are:
1. Full BLA approval FDA vaccine. ""allow"" lawsuit concerned companies mandate vaccination employees (even though mandate now, misconception already there).
2. Kids vaccinated (first 5-11, 2-5, 0.5-2).

Once cross those, ""over"" gets. question is, many unvaccinated get naturally clog hospitals, potentially killing others need medical care? let kids get vaccinated? I‚Äôd wait until‚Ä¶herd immunity? us bunch unvaccinated people could get bad case vaxxed person passes them. UK vaxxed people way less unvaxxed people spread to. July 27: 

- 5,260,033 doses COVID-19 vaccine administered Alberta

- 75.6 percent 12+ population received least one dose (64.3% total population)

- 64.3 percent 12+ population fully vaccinated (54.7% total population)

Alberta population estimated right around 4.45 million so. 

That means still 1.5 million Albertans vaccinated all, 2 million first dose (including 12 numbers) aren‚Äôt protected especially Delta etc. LOT people still overwhelm hospitals go around still putting others risk. mask mandate make difference? study done still mandate, healthcare workers presumably frequently masked general public.

Look recent outbreak Washington Nationals. 12 players/coaches 1 unvaxxed. Nasty. TL;DR: So, dumbfucks, get vaccinated still works. something front face, (like mask), logic tell us viral load would reduced even further? Basically, yeah. think virus vs immune system opposing armies, soldiers invasion has, better getting walls, right? wouldn‚Äôt think would simple, often is. missed important point. Israel re-imposed indoor mask mandate. wonder much booster increase effectiveness/efficacy. Regardless, really hope get one soon. definitely people know like that, basically refer stats severe illness unvaccinated, none talked today think putting others population risk way (ie breakthrough infection, higher transmissibility certain variants, increased risk new variants, many still aren‚Äôt vaccinated like kids, etc). Also, even vaccinated may get mild symptoms, mean may short long term issues. discharge kids infants TIME RSV. problem sometimes turns bronchiolitis need heated high flow usually don‚Äôt die. 13 days trip there. wore mask required.

Restrictions hospitalizations become negligible. We're disagreeing here. think points really correct though. generally agree possibility mutation significant things could get worse, but... 

1. (all?) respiratory viruses spread asymptomatically. However, COVID infectious.
2. COVID actually mutate much. However, many instances COVID due widespread is. Also, since new virus, unoptimized arrived us. graph theory perspective, mutations slow time goes on, unless break new unexplored territory (ie, adopts mutations makes previously negative mutations actually positive).  
3. guess I'm confident one. However, think majority reinvention breakthroughs variants infecting someone immunized older strain COVID. wonder mutations significant cause reinfection. 

Right Delta appears basically variant worry reasonably vaccinated countries. instances virus, greater number mutations trying -- likely time virus discover new beneficial mutation may surge India. far least, looks like Delta remains fit form virus though.  
No guarentee things work out, think inevitable COVID keeps finding beneficial mutations either.

Breakthrough infections sound common vaccinated individuals, re-catching come surprise basically breakthrough infection natural immunity. know like antivaxxers opinions wrong, really go far threatening harm death upon them. blew first hurdle originally said ""just one month flatten curve, we're together!"" bullshit continually pushed goalposts back couple months time year half.

You understand ""flattern curve"" meant, you? Nothing repeatedly proven strong vaccine efficacy ‚Äúwishful thinking‚Äù. 

The data continues support claims vaccine efficacy strong. Selective news reports anecdotes data. No. dont think vaccinated people going throw away two weeks work school asymptomatic case, they'll bother testing unless they're sick. going interested PR reality situation. hold fort down!

Unless fort inflatable, hold *down*! need hold keep strategic ground. noted reverb Freedom Day wouldn‚Äôt instantaneous. bump cases would start show later week early next, symptoms appear two weeks exposure. predicted, overall, ‚Äúwe won‚Äôt see huge surges we‚Äôve seen past.‚Äù 

That said us reopened fully. see happened... asked Irish friend unvaccinated people tend lean conservative literally understand question, because...in Europe never leaders spoke science. Like, people vaccines Ireland actually read news like blood clot cases AstraZenica. kinda understand that, understand refusing get vaxxed thnk there's ""a chip inside controlled Bill Gates Obama"". Like. wtf America. really ""hill billy, bucked tooth, dumbasses"" like stereotypes portray us UK suddenly open last week, Ireland life close normal summer UK less restrictions us throughout. 

If anything there's probably less mixing since 'Freedom Day' Euro's ending reported April 2021 , American Chemical Society Spring 2021 meeting :
The first 7 mg compound synthesized late July 2020. Encouraged early biological data, Pfizer team aimed scale synthesis. late October, they‚Äôd made 100 g compound. two weeks later, chemists scaled synthesis 1 kg. COVID antibodies, got Pfizer, second shot almost killed me. like body screaming ""no more!""

I'm sure that's actually happening, I'm really worried booster body's reaction it. \*want\* get it, also want see people fare 3rd shot. many selfish entitled crybabies unfortunately. Comparatively, dying covid sort one done. Living long-term serious infection debilitating systemic degradation documenting b*, mention avg 8.5 drop IQ news now, bankrupting hospitalization bill. 

I‚Äôll take whatever steps meds increase odds, covid either becomes seasonal virus mutates downstream another serious global lockdown event. 

Don‚Äôt want vaccinate mask up? Good luck that, Darwin. 

/My two pennies. people. UK one least vaccine hesitant countries world. well-vaccinated Indonesia? Another commenter pointing worrisome trend metrics, even predicting next big variant Indonesia. Great communication skills, peers invested specific topic. 

The ""dumbing down"" referring believe us referenced layman's terms. imo, hard scientists. Also getting interested science usually aren't. 

Being able talk anybody also skill become genius every field scientist. make dumb knowing. Even still natural protection strain caught, delta new strain. People vaccinated old strain catching delta. infections mild immunity previous strain. always felt like indoor mask mandates allowed things stay open more. least vaccination rates go up. lifted back May, really felt like would take one step forward, two steps back, well... Took 10 months notice narcolepsy side effect h1n1 vaccine. ‚ÄúVaccine effectiveness‚Äù would zero haven‚Äôt vaccine, good grief. statistically significant Stop getting ""sources"" 4chan bro. vaccine suppose protect you? that's case need others get it. viral theory, viruses mutate supposedly kills them. seen disinfectant products tell overdo using them. So..... what's problem here.... OH YEAH.... tricked federal government, heed warnings others would become perpetual, want admit wrong. Especially plainly obvious pandemic, otherwise would see body bags hazmat suites lining streets.... hmmmm...... PCR accurate 5-7 days exposure. Isolate meantime possible job

Well, think idea ""their job"" changed time. Initially, think popular perception everyone would get vaccinated, virus would disappear, *Rocky* theme would start playing everything would go back ""normal."" (unrealistic prevalent) narrative, vaccines failed job.

The realistic outcome, say, vaccines would simply reduce severity illness vaccinated population. sense, indeed seem like ""their job.""

But need get everyone page vaccines actually supposed achieve, realistically expect based strategy using vaccines alone. Perhaps much would like, need things well. Using platform spread lies vaccines come prison sentence. That's enough nonsense. first amendment protect directly leading death people.  think people's anxieties running wild. institute immediately then? Shows silly mandate announce Wed, COVID takes day Thurs, suddenly everyone must wearing one Friday? Alpha too, Delta lead lot infections. guess one positive 1 39 still sick enough able work 6 weeks infection. also one immunocompromised person group say person.

Also really let Dr. Monica Gandhi easy considering one loudest voices saying long covid basically impossible vaccinated. Zero COVID fantasy, even important one. live virus' diseases constantly. COVID serious symptoms serious. vaccines turn COVID toothless tiger, mission accomplished. Got question lads

Why mandates getting vaccinations, many mask wearing?

It would much easier places required proof vaccination, instead wearing mask sounds like literally making scare people wonder everyone innovative leaves town dies. sure counters said. post said two things *nothing* other. think pointing business taking funds designed keep alive engaging simple practical measures designed help situation necessitated life line first place valid.

Unless assertion problem businesses faced were/are government restrictions that, without those, covid created problems them. laughable. duh wasn‚Äôt going disappear. fact it‚Äôs incubating spreading primarily among unvaccinated what‚Äôs going allow thrive. 

If everyone got vaccinated there‚Äôs potential nearly eradicate like polio. Yes, please. Sincerely, Florida resident. Fuck that. Get shot risk it. Wear mask risk it. Life hard dumbos get risk society protect stupidity. making claim goes common understanding upset people asking evidence?

Yes, worth time want anybody believe you. That's I've heard well some. certainly took way worse grandparents. be. Test everyone anyone possible exposure, mask mask. Basically sums up! Covid round 2 officially here. quite rounds over. premature reopening summer made whole thing last much longer.  get single cold flu past winter largely masks awesome

I cold right now. flu, know. COVID (I took test, came back negative). First time since pandemic. feel like shit, I've popping Sudafed like M&amp;Ms.

I'd live normal, mask-free life. states like FL I'm in. Vaccine passports mask mandates illegal. whatever want. Kinda like wild west kinda darwinian time. want get vaccinated, likely suffer infection. Gotcha. curious close one get infected. Wish guys speedy recovery. agree. miserable want control everyone around company misery. That's ive telling people remote thing going follow big tech companies since seem bent bringing people back hard see smaller ones following suit. Delta puts us bad position naught anyway check neighbours Sweden. government went full Florida they've lost many times people Nordic nations locked down. sickest I've 10 years. Worse flu I've had. I'd absolutely get second shot absolutely horrific. Underrated comment friend. What's bizarre rapid drop is--basically January lockdown. could theoretically natural peak infection sudden enough make wonder something else changed. us got really sick 2nd shot. Way way better getting covid way could monthly People younger healthier intense immune response. old people know barely felt anything. Everyone PTO things like that, terms vaccine uptake someone want begin think need sweeten pot bit. I'm favor cash incentives myself. really worth energy show articles data? person's mind set certain direction they'll defend idea grave. I'm open minded. next months may show this. along tracks UK. 

If gets like soon know many vaccinated friends equantances catching fairly ill. mainly hurts extreme aged. they'll struggle peddle 99 percent figure. 

I would say sensational claim suggesting effective. article linked OP Yeah county ""red"" aka high transmission area CDC website. 43% vaccinated. School starts 3 weeks masks optional regardless vaccination status. Storm waiting happen.

3 weeks ago, maybe third people masked stores. 2 weeks ago, maybe 20%. Last week people. Yesterday went, probably 80% wearing masks. live conservative area too.  point can't see every unvaxxed person going get virus. us, got really sick second shot likely looking forward third. doesnt mean wasnt worth obviously was. really suck. even close sick following day 10 years. Staff school work shutdown day 2nd shots provided due 80% calling sick following day Why? gain you? Vaccines pretty much guarantee get hospitalized already. What's issue breakthrough case asymptomatic mild even question it? None them, give youths!  CDC needs make fucking mind needed masks since day one, quirurgical masks everyone uses, masks actually filter pathogens like n95s. priority risk groups since day one. ""It's free country"" arguement tired protective folks believe. 

Anyone want vaccinate free work elsewhere hire them. punishment reprisal terminate employment contract failure adhere company policy.

At dawn climate change awareness due effects middle Covid Year 2, care petty reasons people holding us back anymore. Get GTFO. I‚Äôm legit confused. someone generally speaking United States terms Covid? similar situation 6 months ago? things improved legit concern things could get much worse? It‚Äôs feels like everyone opening DC, people talking mask mandates again. It‚Äôs confusing lol. bet coughing isolation support sick pay. masks masks masks people.

Edit: Apologies, poor choice words. [Chiijohn wants fucking word  Hilarious awesome Nah, people perfectly justified upset length pandemic. something logical mean people's emotional reactions justified. seen anyone suggest ""it's like light switch"" except you. I've wondered this. us recently vaxed try avoid high dose wear masks areas people ie. locking getting small exposures day seem like would keep immune systems duty. literally quoted New York Times headline said. know go ancedotal evidence know 5 people past 2 weeks tested postive, 4 double vaccined, 3 4 quite bad covid symptoms. subreddit would useful grew town like this, fled city soon old enough. many us small town weirdos here. user day said vaccinated someone close would disown did. 

Told get say anything (how going know?) hey, let kick life don‚Äôt care best interests. know easier said done dependent someone etc.

I MO friends/colleagues people come families anti-vax COVID deniers. friends got vaccinated depending family either aren‚Äôt saying anything even seeing still. thing ‚Äúfollowing science‚Äù good science backs findings publishing data used reach conclusions. poorly designed badly analyzed study right take policy wrong direction easily.

Making pronouncements don‚Äôt match already seen far studies, pronouncements don‚Äôt immediately back transparency around data used? sort thing going met extreme skepticism rest scientific community, CDC Israel guilty score. Add CDCs multiple missteps communicating actual bad decisions throughout pandemic, shouldn‚Äôt surprise people questioning every move. Vaccines still great efficacy delta; Israel study backtracked little bit yesterday- fucked comparing highly vaccinated area national avg determining efficacy)

The thing really changed CDC said theres study viral load vaccinated people Delta match unvaccinated. little bit fear asymptomatic vaccinated people could spread Delta higher originally thought - thus return mask guidance.  disputing data, I‚Äôm pretty sure report couple weeks ago saying vaccine 90% effective severe illness. pretty difference small period time. course anecdotal (as individual's situation providing additional anecdotes), science (per CDC Israel) backing up.
Since beginning pandemic, I've always found particular subreddit interesting early indicator. lot threads back people losing sense smell taste became recognized symptom. Also individuals thread definitely anti-vax; strong pro-vax sentiment given people's experiences covid before. precisely new guidance damaging. important metric highlight final point somehow it‚Äôs downplayed. never 100% effective prevent infection wholesale, keeps alive hospital. That‚Äôs incredible. Look death hospitalization rates surging well vaccinated countries areas compared last year. seeing efficient variant prevalent think CDC even realizes hence insanely scattered case models display range like 11k-250k possible infections. Bottom line; vaccines job. Breaking news. US needs lifetime pandemic give workers human rights couple hours big deal.  contact around four hours. I‚Äôm ER shortness breath. really blows. I‚Äôve careful last year ""Hide facts lie reality would validate wrong people!""


Do ever listen yourself?  Cruise ships airtight all‚Ä¶there huge open doors outside every deck.

Also don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair make sound like cruise lines want unvaccinated people all. One suing Florida this, others made life unpleasant unvaccinated passengers (literally allowed close quarters parts ship) tacked testing health insurance fees requirements discourage booking. And? 
You said every outbreak seen among unvaccinated. gave example one among fully vaccinated people. Probably this: CDC rolling back lot policy last months. Saying vaccinated people masking inside places, exposed somebody Covid, get tested regardless symptoms not, stuff like that. true, illegal Florida right now. DeSantis recently appeal cruise line wanted require them: understand virus exposes exactly damned mRNA process vaccine bloody worried about? understand mRNA works, bothered learn? 

And apply fear rare vaccine reactions orders-of-magnitude dangerous NOVEL UNAPPROVED EXPERIMENTAL VIRUS that's currently running around even bothering ask politely injecting RNA body? 

I swear anti-vaxxers act like live magic bubble opt risk simply saying shot. stats many Pfizer/Moderna/J&amp;J/Other doses administered globally? hope? all? got vaccinated everything book, seems like going naught.

Yes. see it, need stop listening possible fear mongering media does. headline perfect example taking literal worst possible situation pretending inevitable, reality next impossible. 

""Just mutations away"" could cause disaster literally ANYTHING. cold could become instant death mutations. could also get hit directly meteor drop dead exact second brain aneurism. extremely unlikely.

Not extremely uncommon plagues happen, science keep hard optimistic.

Leave sub. I'm saying mean. seem extremely bothered this. take headlines like seriously listen lot fear mongerers here, never see light.

Yes, Covid serious. no, something ignore. death sentence loom forever. Unless immune system compromised, little worry about. Get vaccine, take healthy steps live healthier life (diet exercise people, maybe vitamins), move on.

If immune compromised, sympathies. advice stands, stressing out. Talk doctor come solid plan stop listening headlines. True! clear rage typing. :) mean GOP, general, would say something like reason to. care covid say anything like that. company gave us extra vacation day bribe get vaccine. don‚Äôt know actually got numbers since sent bribe end June everyone work directly got vaccine February. kind mask agree with. Delta could logical answer would satisfy us. Data used make decisions barely included delta strain infections. Yes, it‚Äôs Peak American believe something like this, media also pushing narrative constantly, don‚Äôt blame people falling it. Question need understand. vaxxed, lower likelihood severe disease death. Great. However, since get virus transmit others, making virus future strains worse mutates? seems may case. Work brought mask mandate back everyone. can‚Äôt believe still held hostage anti askers anti- vaxxers news, Netflix announces filming Florida anti-vax crowd want people get boosters would fortify defenses virus vaccinated, truly concentrate pandemic within unvaxxed camp, would (further) weaken case vaccination. even insidious political agendas too, basically retaining control ""movement"". UK majority 50+ year olds getting it. hospital deaths double vaccinated. Something seems really fishy United States data. friends family recent surge. Vaccinated much not. Sometimes even more. fishy data coming usa . No, like top comments need learn communicate properly learn pandemic. different would things States stricter mask laws communications regarding masks? Definitely States would've better let gas kept foot mandatory mask laws. common knowledge awhile even delta variant, vaccinated people potentially catch spread covid still. Even I'm fully vaxxed I'm going public mask less. literally science works. change think true learn discover. problem Fauci fragile people like can't handle change learning growth. Grow up. read Lambda CDC tracked serious infections requiring hospitalization deaths among fully vaccinated people. publishing data timely manner, stopped national tracking mild asymptomatic infections.

This infuriating. People right know we're seeing increases mild asymptomatic infections. data show significant increase rate infections among vaccinated people, that's game changer.

As ""sorry, boss, I'm going risk even mild COVID infection, result long-term health consequences, I'm back working home."" It‚Äôs heavily politicized. There‚Äôs also lot overlap anti-vaxxers, racists, homophobes, Christian nationalists new age hippie homeopathy types.

Wanna know common? Anti-intellectualism. don‚Äôt operate evidence-based model. They‚Äôd rather find anything reinforces flawed dangerous worldview accept reality. tangled bedsheets isn‚Äôt contagious. die tonight tangled bedsheets, doesn‚Äôt raise chances members household, coworkers, child encountered yesterday grocery store, could die bedsheets well. Infectious diseases different, need work little harder protect communities. foot bill? reason look hope/futility perspective. situation inherited. viruses mutate, especially migrating hosts. something like 8 billion people infect majority getting vaccinated anytime soon. 

We always knew could become seasonal virus annual maybe biannual vaccines. influenza virus good historical precent situation. end world. major turn events; would likely outcome viral pandemic. 

Humanity lived much worse, bigger problems ahead us well (climate change currently 1.3¬∞C?). Getting vaccine ""for naught"". navigating world inhabit. much better vaccine without it. also fine get booster. world know end. Things sometimes feel better, sometimes worse, mean hope. live DC. 30 Total COVID-19 Patients DC Hospitals July 16th. 27 July 27th. I'm pretty certain new CDC Mask Guidelines based cases hospitalizations. Yesterday, DC 7 day case average increased, bumped next left risk pushed us recommended mask zone. 

I think people misunderstanding CDC Director since good speaking public. Someone already commented thread 10% front line medical workers already tested positive despite MRNA vaccines (and even vaccine year yet). Since average person decades left live, imagine us going get Covid, likely multiple times. gonna start putting brown people camps next? 

Oh wait.. He'd probably use argument they're safe wear masks. Preach! Sucks worry kids can't get vaccinated. kept home last year. hotspot area. cases rising fast feel like insane person exact boat last year start school. Ugh. data correlate countries . Suspicious You‚Äôre idiot ‚ÄúMade real chicken‚Äù

Is also really sus, like, shit wasn‚Äôt question felt need print box. small bright spot upswing vaccinations currently most-affected states: Arkansas, Missouri, Louisiana, Alabama. shame took horrible outbreak scare sense people, hopefully largely rural vaccine-hesitant crowd get board. Hey,. get (I spent 38 days Hospital,. 16 days ICU Ventilator). Trust me.. I'm happy whole ordeal. 

But (humans) get dictate conditions variables pandemic. Virus conscious-being. can't reason it. option (collectively) really try adapt respond it. (and yes,.. poor job could better). 

But there's timetable schedule pandemic. get control that. variant could come tomorrow 20% mortality rate make 2020 look like walk park. simply know (and control that). You‚Äôre wrong. Stop posting shit. Man guys learned NOTHING pharmaceutical companies causing massive opioid epidemic past two decades. shit they‚Äôre giving another shot. There‚Äôs evidence it‚Äôll protect longer first two did. They‚Äôre profiting all. didn‚Äôt care opioid epidemic people don‚Äôt care now. Stop trusting damn companies. back March Delta may playing role rate breakthrough infections. Also believe players vaccinated J&amp;J vaccine even Delta less effective mRNA vaccines. study looked health care personnel, first responders, essential workers December March, likely wear masks take precautions would unvaccinated, reduction relative get sick least summer. live Pennsylvania. literally argument someone basically said understand medicine yet they're commenting see point getting vaccine still get pass around actually agree downvoted saying much. stragglers fence sitters worth vaccinating. despised messaging CDC past couple days. Good point. It‚Äôs bad week CDC People wanting scientists marketing skills commercial company they‚Äôre telling us stay alive‚Ä¶idk country anymore. guy tourniquet doesn‚Äôt finesse message guess half us lose limbs ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è ""could"" anything mutations.

Whats CDC making horrible calls. mean definitely deserve losing money; great selling cost could easily made huge profit despite ethical question so. They‚Äôve decided people getting vaccine ‚Äúshed ‚Äúvirus them. Essentially, invent something could use every aspect argument get vaccinated getting vaccinated. want get vaccinated don‚Äôt make us sick. invent way could making sick. Forcing companies cities take measures get people sick Minimum, 1-2 years last variant concern emerged. science denier unless began wearing mask due delta variant data unique personal circumstance. objective reason average vaccinated folks wear masks USA June. No.. attitude ""this easy flick like lightswitch"" logical reasonable. 

This global wide pandemic. PANDEMIC. natural disaster like Volcano etc. something reasoned with. can't ring Virus ol' telephone say:.. ""Hey.. Brunch 10:30 super frustrating, shut pandemic !.. We're REALLY tired it!""

There course things Humans could done respond better (no argument there).. there's schedule time-table pandemic. Thinking be,.. part creates drives frustration. Yeah test actual human population safety efficacy, would think takes significant time. know it‚Äôs pretty common asymptotomatic people.

This sentence make sense. Long covid tendency covid symptoms linger long time, bothering person normally would've recovered.

In order long covid, can't asymptomatic. need present symptoms. They're rare all. Look countries data.. uk 50s majority cases deaths fully vaccinated 70 percent roughly. rare thing all. Also herd know vaccinated people catching spreading it. rate prevents infection spread slim none. thought always known meant reduce symptoms?

Seems USA u tell data played with. recording vaccine case got really ill. That's hilarious, I'm local made mistake. Yes right OC also spiking. they‚Äôre dumb they‚Äôre wrong it‚Äôs best idiotic drivel parrot. Hindsight *so* last year sure criticizing anything AZ this. committed right start profit vaccine pandemic (Unlike Pfizer Moderna). AZ $4 dose, Pfizer closer $20, Moderna around same.

Losing money profiting, impact supply availability many world still relying AZ (and can‚Äôt afford $20 dose Pfizer Moderna). guessing hospitals Nepal stretched, survival chances better you‚Äôre vaccinated.

That's consideration too. hope, blocked walls stupidity politics serious limits legal coercion US government regard mandating vaccines- seen real attempts so.

That's best way think compel people America. Bet enforced cleanly Best Case Scenario: Masks work, fewer people die

 
Worst Case Scenario: Masks work, amount people gonna die, die anyways, uncomfortable grocery store hour.  That's attitude going shot. I'll patriotic duty take one team, die, die. Well, part. willing die then, sure hell willing die now. Adult population, total population.

I would much like know people interacting believe people complain get something someone else gets, even personal choices leading point.

We have, literally, decades experiential evidence showing people complain someone else getting something get, even could easily get even reason get good. 

From political perspective, ""Pay 100 dollars person gets vaccine"" ""Fine people get vaccine 100 dollars"" generate exactly amount resistance/complaining people want get vaccine. coworker came back Florida week ago appears laryngitis.

I‚Äôm concerned kids sometimes come in. matter either way motivation behind it? unvaxxed folks among genpop right now. fuck em redditor said vaccinations cannot mandated US wrong.

&amp;nbsp;

So havent done it? big chunk population radicalized vaccines and/or COVID, mandating vaccines would big (negative) impact political party seen mandate it. Norovirus enters chat.  Mother God. I‚Äôm number DW groups masks issue every single one them. There‚Äôs large loud number people wanted go DW zero changes made pandemic. looked UK curve? MUCH steeper last 2 3 months U.S. guess define 'blip'... me, think might looking steep rise infections followed steep fall (probably steeper initial drop vaccines became widely available), variants work way two groups next six months so... 

1) unvaccinated. kids age 9 6 I'm anything puts unnecessary risk exposure, including going office work, going large scale public events, eating crowded restaurant, similar activities. reassess everyday based number cases, remains relatively low state. never stopped wearing masks public except outdoor situations. wife I, fully vaxxed, wear situation calls bit leeway before. Again, subject change things progress... 

2) vaxxed forced situations like, say, return office commuter trains September. getting lot ink, situations nearly irresponsible unvaccinated offices requiring people back NEED trying get back control. ego, impatience, tax breaks. Many give single F well workers worker's families. 

I say comparing U.K. difficult different ways administered 2nd shots. Also, willing play effective defense numbers crept back up... U.S., almighty dollar rules, ""leaders"" business politics go kicking screaming result deaths, hospitalization and, ironically, worse economy we'd masked held unnecessary things like returns office, concerts, etc. months  Wear masks shut totally. afford tickets, stand lines, wear mask count blessings. recall correctly, Biden said bought something like 60 millions doses astrazeneca, going donated countries since US enough vaccines manufacturers. explaining headline. dont think people going write articles headlines specifically you. I'm torn. one hand, medical procedures get damn business. other, we've seen [best hesitant (hesitant, anti-vax) see friends families vaccinated without major side effects. keeping secret, lose edge. I've got primarily typically republican/libertarian branch family 8/8 adults vaccinated, honestly think 2/8 convinced 6/8 first. retail. way knowing many hundreds people come contact every day covid, I'm going get randomly tested every day. stats sites help. Pick favorite use [John [Our World numbers. Generally, 7-day average numbers are...

Cases US risen back April levels (67k) rising lows almost Fauci-target numbers (less 12k June). 

Deaths risen slower (almost certainly due vaccinations). Currently 303/day bottoming near 230 early July.

These rises risks somewhat regional, seen look State County level data there.

HTH? Ah yes. vaccine definitely works. campaigns rile up, people riled seatbelts, too. Hayes' point people get riled mandates, end, mostly abide. wish parents, 60, received second shot 5 months ago, eligible boosters US. I've told medical workers using regular paper masks unless dealing known infection. use n95. also figured would simply use n95 go-to.  could understand people first wondering safe. However, almost *4 billion* shots given worldwide. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know safe is‚Äù longer excuse. would nice broke 5-11 12-18 separate groups, given one vaccine access much time period not. Lmao‚Ä¶.dude‚Ä¶.nobody talks like real life. Back away put keyboard sir there‚Äôs booster, sign fuck up! getting immediately. no, time exclude non vaccinated (save kids unable get shot). idiots society's limiting factor. Remember nurses though party became cluster infections. Safety work, lax home. Amazing, Canada showing USA things right, again‚Ä¶ Idk, could lying. literally nurse friend (works pediatrics ward) refuses‚Äîand coworkers‚Äî afraid ‚Äúinfertility issues‚Äù. 

üôÑ wish guys could get doses. I‚Äôm talking doses sitting pharmacies going get thrown time export shelf life. anti-vaxx isn‚Äôt going utilize, give coming needing booster. would say people vaccinated hard convince start wearing mask - even mandates. way government going able convince anti-vax anti-mask crowd so. work first time - are. Questioning science? Covid apparently.  
 
Cases went mask mandate went lifted. Everyone know got covid wore masks. recovered fine way. Masks don‚Äôt work. Even manufacturers state boxes masks effective covid.  
 
Vaccinated still getting spreading covid.  
 
How many things put kids hospitals far often require treatments cause cancer sterility? Cause according box masks picked Home Depot warnings stated manufacturer.  
 
Or cause blood clots, heart problems, anaphylaxis, Thrombosis, immune system paralysis, deaths according CDC website. virus typically causes cold flu symptoms. 

Which treatment manufacturers sue injure child? 

My guess many.  That's basically true every important situation ever. become part planning strategy adjust prepare potential changes Maybe it‚Äôs soon drama point, but‚Ä¶ cousin saying? agree people best suited make public health recommendations source required? Thus, argument based cdc recommendation time.

If want that, it‚Äôs pretty clearly responsibility show peer reviewed study demonstrates appropriate benefits masking amongst fully vaccinated people levels community spread weeks following removal masking requirements. Reminder Harvey Norman took millions jbkeeper need kept it. Federal government *silent*****. Ontario, debate creating vaccination passport. lot people claim (erroneously ask me) asked provide vaccination status privacy violation. guess backward neck wood, would be. Assuming know person ill. ruling may well say get tested indoor space humans. showing symptoms person exposed showing symptoms even know exposed one talks past infection either, vaccinated default come contact virus become immune one way another  Illinois, northern Chicago specifically. getting excited Chicago finally caught everywhere else. depressing, honestly. Yeah - see press ""Tens millions rush get vaccine"", also happened.

The proportion *adult* population vaccinated (at least one dose) UK currently almost exactly 90%. figure still rising - recent weeks vaccine generally available youngest adults, still significant rise proportion 18-24 year olds receiving it. vaccine generally available children, tend see vaccination rate including children reported, obviously much lower figure really represent actual uptake.

Showing couple thousand idiots agree vaccine makes good news story, really tiny minority compared population 60 million people. vocal anti-vaxers town's Facebook group, personally know single person get vaccinated moment age group became eligible. UTSW dallas came new projections. show unless vaccination rates greatly increase...by october winter surge better way phrase maybe 'trust scientists indeed working uncover truth help people working serve nefarious corporate interetsts'. may true - constitution severely restricts far US government take mandates, without support state governors - way enforce mandates. 

So, even entitlement issue - politics is. absolutely take booster. ‚ÄúJust move bro‚Äù isn‚Äôt advice Fully vaccinated would never consider booster. dealing chronic back inflammation since second shot. Obviously can't prove vaccine related several athletic friends also dealing long term inflammation previous existing/old injuries, makes sense would related. I'd willing bet money getting boosters year year would shave expectancy life well. extreme immune response justifiable first two doses, level inflammation never good overall health. Corporate America gonna save losing mind mask mandate vaccinated. Uh huh. People tend go ‚Äúfull drama mode!‚Äù end sight fluctuating mandates make life abnormal. Events cancelled, masks vaccinated people, abnormal. I‚Äôm telling right now: every single person know reaching final mental breaking point this. Starting sound like vaccine working delta Many turned covid vaccines *all* vaccines. end still pharma company

Their main motivation profit want profit. even mean vaccine, covid killing main base vulnerable, protecting cash cow work retail worked busy holiday season vaccines even available. told supposed see family interacting hundreds strangers close contact every day pretty frustrating. people retail sort said ""fuck it"" long ago. People worked home last year half really idea. you‚Äôre nurse working COVID positive patients?! please stop using false equivalence. know it‚Äôs misleading.

In fact, many areas, surge far worse Dec/Jan peak. Maybe changing location would help. many better places live. family member social anxiety called place advance ask would work.

They happy explain. went, told condition accommodated problem. could support buddy close kept everything quiet/calm possible.

I know calling people hard. explaining anxiety. found no-one judged wanted get shot arm anyway could :)

And maybe (and one), talk doc helps anxiety. family member advised take diazepam appointment one handy it, seemed help lot.

Anecdotally, Walgreens/CVS vaccinations seem involve less people health department appointment. could call ask quietest time come would be.


(This assumes US, guess) believe nonscientific big-brained people who'd rather *masks* vaccine. Well apparently lot people got deathly ill second shot read comments below. swear everyone know IRL 95% zero mild side-effects worst heard someone fever symptoms trouble sleeping.

The majority people make big deal boosters antivaxxers though. seriously believe people get hospitalised die vaccine entire medical world blame new covid variant somehow. Fair enough, thank reply. assume extrapolating negative reactions adults children death/hospitalization 12s. Everyone hoping goes well. Lmao WHAT???

Why think ‚Äúwere born mask on?‚Äù makes kind sense whatsoever? Please explain me. That‚Äôs nonsensical.

We problem viral virus spreading wear masks help stop spread. It‚Äôs simple B logic. rains outside don‚Äôt want get wet say ‚Äúwell wasn‚Äôt born raincoat on‚Äù walk outside naked? 

When want go somewhere say ‚Äúwell wasn‚Äôt born cars vagina I‚Äôd better walk take car public transit‚Äù?? 

Holy shit. I‚Äôm intrigued this. born without mask make sense explanation wouldn‚Äôt wear one? need know. You‚Äôve got explain me.

Do know things like clothes houses electricity became ‚Äúnormal‚Äù? think it‚Äôs woman birthed house electricity woman birthed baby wearing clothes magically normal things?

Holy fuuuuuck can‚Äôt believe dumb is. Please, explain painstaking detail. promise full attention. I‚Äôm ready converted line thinking üôåüèª Yeah, even beginning Pfizer Moderna giving figures upper 90s. ones dock Florida. requiring vaccinations. know UK there, one least vaccine hesitation going. 90% adults atleast 1 dose. bedside nurses tested weekly, come back positive taken floor. admin know won‚Äôt hurt bottom line. Iirc, tests $40 people pay even liberal states universal mandate right now. (CA, NY, NJ, WA, etc) incredibly cynical. pharma companies either sat side lines took for-profit vaccine deals, AZ took at-cost vaccine. mess It‚Äôs still effective preventing serious illness death. bit less effective preventing infection transmission thought. know word ""endgame"" thrown around lot here, IMO almost criminal incoming mask mandates come attached specific metric threshold jurisdiction needs hit (more vaccinations, lower hospitalizations) they're rescinded. vague ""until things get better"" enough. Don‚Äôt waste effort vaccinate town  never question. knew type vaccine got. people forget this? Sounds obnoxious. Yup. Threat monies promise mo monies. Realistically, yes, governments made (voluntary) rapid at-home testing available long time ago. came reasonably accurate, cheap produce tests near beginning pandemic improved since then. It‚Äôs crazy many countries (including mine) put many barriers allowing people test regular basis. literally effort wear mask literally save one life. sad existence XD spiked dove. Go look UK‚Äôs current numbers vs weeks ago spike. dropped dramatically without restrictions place. aren‚Äôt disagreeing here. 

Bingo. is. 

We don‚Äôt agree, tbh. 

1. example, according you, then, agree: dismissing data ‚Äúmedia hysteria‚Äù would intentionally misleading.

2. fact, many areas, surge **already** worse so-called ‚Äúnationwide‚Äù peak Dec/Jan.

3. Even Jan/Feb hospital system strains regionally localized, too. That‚Äôs similar what‚Äôs happening now, tbh. Insinuating *can‚Äôt* similar Jan/Feb also misleading, tbh.

4. please stop using specious equivalencies ‚Äúprove‚Äù specious opinions. Perhaps agree isn‚Äôt helpful, although doubt will. Per Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) used collect reports adverse events vaccination general public. primarily used identify potential topics investigate regards vaccine reactions. However, event data VAERS often verified often self-reported, assumed adverse events VAERS actually associated cause vaccines, possible estimate frequency adverse events data.

Still worried catching rare disease public worried covid. suffer allergies practically year-round. Occasionally I'll flareups resemble minor cold. one flareups. getting better, spend last week wondering allergies, one last winter's no-show illnesses, Breakthrough COVID.

Was gonna get tested get better. ‚Äúso Less likely become infected‚Äù? Kids virtually immune this. Name one thing less likely become infected from?  
 
‚ÄúThe ones getting vaccinated fear mongers."" Really? According CDC website Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting system HHS lists since Jan 2020 6,207 died vaccines 6 months US alone. That‚Äôs 60 years flu vaccine related deaths. Yes flu vaccine kills 100 year.  
 
According CDC website vaccine causes blood clots, heart problems, anaphylaxis, Thrombosis, immune system paralysis, deaths. virus typically causes cold flu symptoms. 
 
But don‚Äôt see wall wall coverage virus deadly tested even know 99.98% survival rate. want get vaxxed wear mask fine don‚Äôt gaslight fear monger everyone else Ah yes infamous ¬´¬†The EU = Macron¬†¬ª theory‚Ä¶ Agreed I'll gladly data third Pfizer unexpected. Antibodies peak shortly exposure, decline lower background level remain. less antibodies, get sick easily, **but** immune system's memory allows fight infection easily knows do. would know infected though know?

They say carrier even vaccinated. might around dozens carriers day asymptomatic - including coworkers, family friends. anti-vax Americans value liberty freedom believes medical mandate vaccine taking away from, they're truly ignorant freedom little appreciate it.

Had knuckleheads actually lived country freedom, they'd vaccinated law jailed. Freedom wasted uneducated. Hate say it, I‚Äôve mostly lost faith ‚Äúexperts‚Äù comes pandemic. got extremely sick doses (I‚Äôm immuno compromised intense reaction) would gladly get booster shots needed even every months next years. peace mind vaccine scared constantly/being able leave house amazing I‚Äôm grateful. ought officially supported. never give name, shot recorded database, paperwork given. boosters responsibility.

It's silly, could make difference lot people simply can't afford destroy personal lives this. say without actual data vaccine adverse events children 12? 

They can‚Äôt. 

But idea wild-type, rapidly replicating virus multiple mechanisms manipulate evade immune system somehow less risky single, non-replicating dose nucleic acid coding one single protein doesn‚Äôt pass sniff test. big part too. workers means end profits. protecting you, protect profits. 

Thats fine everyone involved understands benefiting relationship, rarely happens. Yes, let's shut US virus miniscule chance landing hospital deathbed vaccinated. live fear .003% chance death give normal life indefinitely. Kids miss another year school, colleges virtual, cancel weddings, works! /s

This unreal, vaccines work people want vaccine going comply this. Let people choose risk want take. rhetoric ramping CDC nowhere one questioning necessary take precautions? if, populace, even want them? marijuana might legal recreationally Louisiana least decriminalized legal medically! still weird affects people differently.

 easy say, writing waiting friends beer festival, unmasked obviously - reason I'm able sensible, precautionary use restrictions country, waiting shit truly hit fan. I, too, disappointed restriction reimplemented. waste mental energy screaming forever whatever. I'm pretty certain restrictions lower were. reading chart never problem German French media get 8% efficacy from? took test outdoor wedding 5 days ago. hope waited long enough test. hear shit happened me. gotta hope wave short gives companies resolve impose restrictions next surge. really pissed yesterday I‚Äôm getting cause anger isn‚Äôt gonna productive.

Still, many experts agreed least surprised authors‚Äô conclusion, viruses ‚Äúbecome transmissible less pathogenic time‚Äù. all, seductive logic goes, evolutionary perspective makes sense pathogen harm host depends survival. According reasoning, virulenc

Maybe someone needs tell Ebola, Rabbies, Marburg, Dengue, etc. Self tests submitted three times week. missed day get email telling it. son turns 5 November. can't wait get vaccinated. experts thought case numbers would continue climb much longer. I'd like point ""some adult ER patients waiting 10-13+ hours seen"" relevant without information.

Unless compare average ER patient wait times vs pre-pandemic. US, way ER works, patients get triaged deemed require immediate attention wait hours even normal times. 

Maybe 10 hours, ER wait times many parts country always high non-critical patients. I'm saying companies this. definitely should. would even say moral obligation it. 

 also think even end goals align, need remember companies different motivations, really side. Define crazy amounts understanding need get tested come contact (ie around someone least 15 minutes) confirmed positive COVID test. generally means someone tells you, like family member, friend, coworker (although states/countries notification systems well). though, study showed. Less 3% people presumably exposed COVID regular basis developed symptomatic illness, less 20% ofmthise people kind lingering symptoms. Oh yeah that's right. know 2 kids.

I seen professials saying kids 12 low risk coronavirus complications vaccination dangerous disease. anti vaxxer propaganda? 3 year old goes school kids whose parents play NHL team delta outbreak zero symptoms. realize anecdotal, closest call we've had. one said 100%, wtf kind nonsense reading? live NJ, state decent vaccination rates, I‚Äôm 20s.

I don‚Äôt expect avoid Covid entirely lifetime, don‚Äôt believe zero risk mentality, certainly plans visit Florida states low vax rates anytime soon. can't really herd immunity influenzas like UK data giving hope... Delta agressive decline. 2 years Treatments along vaccines going make covid minor issue. True. take away federal money roads, social programs, schools, etc. watch fall line. It‚Äôs done before.  horror lol No, surprisingly. Tuesday vaccinated came contact person positive COVID test didn‚Äôt need get tested. Seems like would favor divorced him. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Thank you! hope able find solution works family. COVID early pandemic also vaccinated now. point accepting COVID endemic humans moving on. 100% encourage anyone wants wear mask so. Especially vaccinated. could, y'know, go get vaccinated free *without* smashing car window. hey, wanna smash windows guest. People assess risk differently. antivax make risk assessment specific, rushed, non-fda approved, seemingly ineffective (based headlines) highly politicized propogandized vaccine. soon people. 

Don't care endorses it, care got didn't, want see risk hospitalization/death/long term effect covid vs. Hospitalization/death/long term effect covid vax.

And numbers still coming in, truth hard discern sides aisle. One side says miracle butterfly drug, side shows Isreals numbers effective/safe thought. sides lie truth somewhere two opinions. where? I'll wear mask mandated, wash hands, take vitamin zinc supplements, take covid test need wait truth becomes evident. currently isn't. That's weird. 95% people know IRL mild side-effects worst, every Reddit thread seems like majority felt horrifically sick weeks Thank good parent convincing son get vaccinated. People like ex part problem, people like part solution! That's me!!! ever worn mask, plan get shot. Ivermectin hydrochloroquin cure long time. I've exposed plenty never gotten it! capability use wonderful thing head blessed with! alpacas covid news since least June 2020 silly tie pride/embarrassment people, especially ones never meet, pick part of, care either. kinda doubt watch CNN though.  tested antibodies see vaccine worked? Hells yes I'm getting booster. Can't put price tag peace mind. Even better free. think lockdowns considered. Masking simple thing help lot, makes sense reinstated. definitely lockdown. understand saying, it‚Äôs quite pedantic. Yes, laws limit liberty, even freest nations value public interest individual. know someone covid close proximity, get tested. Potential exposure happens every day. company don‚Äôt mind asking? mean.......we kinda now? think safe vaccines children I'm you. two young ones, I'm still iffy saying ""screw idiots"" still affect millions families understanding need get tested come contact (ie around someone least 15 minutes) confirmed positive COVID test. generally means someone tells you, like family member, friend, coworker (although states/countries notification systems well). angry unvaccinated. angry. think need switch universities lol. I'm also PhD student Florida university, plus work FT local state college. Nothing online classes online teaching online meetings foreseeable future me. really need in-person interaction point, especially since I'm finish coursework move dissertation, incredibly solitary. Totally anecdotal:
My sister ICU nurse major US city. fully vaxxed people severe Covid. organ transplant patients. Apparently vaccines ineffective population likely others immunosuppressants. would assume large portion deaths people situations. Completely sucks, hopefully vaccines natural infections time reduce numbers enough make population safer. think clinical trials none participants receiving vaccine died COVID, yeah researchers knew amount 100% protection, especially since excluded vulnerable people trials. think want reduce virus's ability replicate turn something else dangerous. Masks cut transmission, much? anyone's guess delta CDC released data. someone playing numbers/people getting tested vaccinated people get hard hit/Underreporting spoke fondly father see. Bless people. tactic pressure people get vaccinated nothing work ""Corporate America"" company already told us vaccines required. even consideration if/when full FDA approval. long want wait zero vaccine related hospitalizations? article actually say cases came from: ""All 37 people data available infected unvaccinated person, **usually within homes**."" crazy, say true, Australian police. I'd like point ""some adult ER patients waiting 10-13+ hours seen"" relevant without information.

***Of course*** we‚Äôre talking ***right now*** taxed healthcare resources due surge vaccine-refusing interlopers. 

It‚Äôs like time-traveled back random date history threw out-of-context factoid.

Sorry wasn‚Äôt clear. get lost logic read statements like this:

""Information Delta variant several states countries indicates that, **rare occasions**, *some* vaccinated people infected Delta variant vaccination may contagious spread virus others""

That's quote article: 

So ""some"" vaccinated people, all, MAY contagious.....in RARE occasions.

It feels like slippery slope headed right back year ago starting make decisions ""rare"" situations. lived near border California crossed checkpoint often produce ban effect. big deal. 

Yes. Let's it. I'm vaccinated ready go. Don‚Äôt get caught number. It‚Äôs 29% smaller subset (19%) small percentage (.0037) people vaccinated. worries work office 4 people company offers free tests 3x week. Also, reminder original ""promise"" (if call that, like goal) *50%*. Yep, confirm. like get choice vaccine receive.

Booking NHS website (instead using GP) gives people many areas way choosing vaccine. clued centres exclusively administering certain vaccines. got vaccinated earlier year, common knowledge locally RE:ACT centre certain industrial unit giving Pfizer jab. well there's one thing know none they're saying front prop private, for-profit companies produce test kits

none whatsoever CDC director gall get national TV, cry use words ‚Äúimpending doom‚Äù moment cases going vaccinations going up. 

That‚Äôs certainty instance untrustworthy communication, it‚Äôs hard take anything say face-value. point is: research. hope right.  HAHA. CDC knows nothing messaging. CDC may know plenty diseases, know nothing PR human behavior. previous administration shut wrong reasons, administration allowed scientists speak idea craft consistent well thought message.

Thanks giving holdouts one thing latch to.  kids going back school beginning August states Tight control, supressive regime, never sees 800 stuck 799.9 Even 95% effectiveness sounds high still means 1/20 times unvaccinated person would gotten COVID, vaccinated person too. symptoms likely milder. point vaccinated person catching COVID unexpected statistically uncommon event. LA County red. Saving inevitably get next panic attack, thank numbers 150k hospitalized fully vaccinated, 6k mention severe cases... I'm sure wrong, yeah, pre-vaccine cases strongly correlated hospitalizations, correlation much much lower. 0, healthcare systems handle many cases. know especially Delta, vaccinated people wearing masks lower cases hospitalizations (the latter mostly exclusively among unvaccinated). solid policy instrument protecting healthcare system people.

I absolutely agree cases great metric, hospitalizations % vaccinated lifting/implementing restrictions based on. US hospitalizations doubled July. Sure, May 2021 levels, nothing like last winter, long want wait something? going fast. Anti-vaxxers anti-drugs right? Besides hippy granola ones anyway, I'm really glad release data soon available. like informed current situation, situation 6+ months ago.  still making huge profits. nearly huge Moderna/Pfizer, pretty soon Novavax. Somehow get away saying making not-for-profit really true.

50% everything serum institute makes profit goes AstraZeneca. fine. generally young people, outside area high vaccination rates. People proof vaccination negative test. 

Missed good chance see MDMA virus, probably.  Kind like promises heaven keep murdering, raping, stealing etc... ü§î I've personally heard classic

""Not getting shot FDA approved!""

And breath, asking they'd get approved,

""No trust gov't!"" people getting. immune vaccine. exponentially less likely die even symptomatic like 150k hospitalizations past month people fully vaccinated... number less half % based entire population still thing, break cases still occur still children/immunocompromised individuals dumbasses greater risk. things listed 10 essential services ACA. Things can't excluded coverage include emergency room treatment hospitalization. suggest can't legally done, good reason. Strange, understand logic. act like new knowledge vaccinated people get sick spread yet we've always known still get sick die stands reason still spread it. long main metric ‚ÄúHOSPITALIZATIONS DEATHS‚Äù still vaccinated get nasty long lasting symptoms.   Yeah reporting makes seem like there's zero reduction infection rates vaccinated people.  that‚Äôs called 2016-2020. It‚Äôs ‚Äúshelters‚Äù bigot small company work one openly anti-vax guy. told come office. us still working home anyway. cancelled first administration. kind timeline realistically looking health experts decide go ‚Äúwait second generation vaccine Delta‚Äù new messaging?

I feel like new messaging cases still rising September. So, based article, seems people build immunity vaccination build immunity infection. Especially increased virulence Delta, doesn‚Äôt seem like there‚Äôs going 3rd option.

So end game ‚Äúget vaccinated get COVID‚Äù unlucky get both. Frustrated hell too. Hang pal. I‚Äôm ready, bring it. Since still get covid vaccinated know, data suggest vaccinated people capable mutation happen? it‚Äôs unvaccinated? Vaccine doesn‚Äôt stop infected, makes symptoms milder. catching sickness surviving it, apparently. That‚Äôs partly CDC telling people wear masks again, even vaccinated. remember immunocompromised folks ya‚Äôll worrying about? Yeah, CDC says catch well. Washington Post ran article it. So, since already virus, vaccinating doesn‚Äôt actually stop spreading vulnerable, see point getting shot right now. Plus I‚Äôve seen enough opioid epidemic don‚Äôt trust pharmaceutical giants community‚Äôs best interests heart. questions Israel outlier hasn‚Äôt shared much methodology. crippled ass take public transportation city looks like delta variant surge starting. Looks like I'll getting better acquainted nearest testing site. least got Pfizer shots protection masks. One coworkers really intelligent person believes larger risk getting vaccinated bringing back home still getting vaccine.

I tried explaining makes ZERO sense vaccinated people still wear masks risk same. Oh, misunderstood. got visit supermarket Langley many years ago visiting Air Force friend. Best practices abundance, sure. I‚Äôm giving clock autism putting microchips it!  anti-vax comment pro-mask one Depends company: mandated test without symptoms

But anyone get boxes tests delivered whenever want.

Yeah, home Lateral Flow tests 1/2 hour ones. comes positive: isolate, tell test trace book PCR test (which delivered picked courier go test centre) many kids die parents get it? old friend refuses get vaccinated despite NICU baby. Smh Yes, r/COVID19positive . breakthrough posts past months. Immune system internal mask. hard understand. think right! day 2 (yesterday) felt LOT better day 1. Today day 3, could even forget got vaccination. hope keeps good rest week! I'd like point ""some adult ER patients waiting 10-13+ hours seen"" relevant without information.

It‚Äôs like randomly time-traveled back random date history throw random factoid. course we‚Äôre talking *right now* taxed hospital systems due surge unvaccinated interlopers. 

Sorry wasn‚Äôt clear. Restaurant bars everything basicly open yesr part less people them. Case bars everyone drinking outside kind crazy world live getting something common sense basic vaccine controversial somehow political‚Ä¶ ""You longer friends cause got vaccinated""

&amp;#x200B;

SMH vaccine safe effective, also continue masks lockdowns boosters shots available Make cute anime girl appeal internet?


They literally made ""Ebola Chan"" Sounds like starting get it. Stay Colorado. Deal? absolutely do, they‚Äôre still extremely effective preventing serious illness death. They‚Äôre slightly less effective preventing transmission previously thought. I've looking breakdown worldwide vaccine production numbers everywhere much luck. manufacturers seem like give info. believe freedom spread deadly disease supersedes others' freedom get it. Fuck that, want live. people do. adult babies indignantly getting vaccinated coughing people's faces causing dangerous variants evolve. people can't get vaccine (due rare medical thing) #1 cheerleaders everyone getting vaccine protected. Fuck! going wearing masks soft lockdowns 10-20 years. hate we're ok \[relatively\] young getting possibly getting long-haul symptoms? Hmm Nope, it'll good US approve travel reasons EU Canada used AZ (along mixing AZ mRNA) causing travel issues etc US recognizing Seattle area around 80% vaccination still listed CDC ""Substantial"" transmission  cant. Prior attempts coerce governors withholding federal money resulted court losses Feds issue courts view punishing people state - leadership. That's based CDC recommendations, right? mandates (LA County, instance) tied those. lack unified strategy also pain point. Hopefully they‚Äôll cover new CDC guidance one found weird CDC puts much emphasis viral shedding breakthrough cases. Like you‚Äôre still 70-95 percent less likely infected still means you‚Äôre far less likely infect anyone else. Seems weird focused this.  view virus vaccine, I'm fairly certain view different vaccine worse.

A lot people thought covid basically ""made china"" government hoax


I even know people think came lab china real ._.



so idk.... much misinformation sift average american maybe time resources so. be, I‚Äôm English enlightened among us envious associated level stupidity. Yeah? desire papers neccessary move states counties? Set check points state lines? doubt CDC needs reel EUA many PCR based tests due high rate false positives. However, many diagnostic companies applying full FDA approval requires much stringent testing. think switch December lead antigen based testing overall, say PCR going completely window. Hey, point whatever gets people vaccinated, I‚Äôll take it. Sorry mate he's got point. US track breakthrough cases period. estimated 1 5 20% vaccinated get sick exposed, quite high. US 100% fucks data. Florida hard. state, Texas. rest deep south too. insidious know go suppressing accurate reporting data, removing public access it, etc. effective vaccines, compared others accepted normal, necessary, effective? 

Am still able get, host, infect people measles, mumps, rubella? Polio? need Novavax approved. traditional tech, better results.  love ones want die, suck it. That's like loved one want wear seatbelt drive saw facebook post one guy drove bridge drowned 1972. **So get 3rd 4th vaccinations?** best reason it. Also make amount like $2000 something, people ignore it. Also, see reason gotten shot already get it. deserve equally good citizens. say bullshit. Even FDA approves, AV's continue find reasons get shots. way people are. ""For something takes hour less""

Do data prove this? 

You throwing numbers around instead actual apples apples comparison average ER wait times. 

Even point ER wait times higher valid, alarmist. simply state took less hour takes 13 hours ""some"" patients. better comparison would look average wait times vs pandemic. cherry pick data based ""some"" patients. 

Unfortunately, seem understand need properly compare data instead throwing cherry picked numbers around. Vanilla. New ones available yet - fact, there's hardly news them. actual lockdowns come back conservative areas time. see anyone political appetite lockdown anymore. common reason see laziness. political views anything like that. dont want bother making appointment going location losing hour 2. work school 40% unvaccinated thsts reason vast majority say God hate pictures feet, especially they're long Funny way put ""speculation"" something sounds official Anecdotal, friend's mother one unlucky ones. caught covid (pre vaccine) really sick 2 weeks. short hospital stay (no ventilator anything) recovered went back home. 6 months later caught second time died within days diagnosed. signed vaccine, supplies still short (back March) never survived make appointment. 

We really shocked. figured since 6 month ago, she' fine even catch again. seemed grab pull extremely quickly second time around. idea happened. Cowards, lot em Finally gave least estimate regular waiting time. waning immunity. young got vaccine recently. older got long ago. kids even school right now. FL mask mandates lifted schools. Buckle up. coworker die Saturday good friend taking husband hospital speak ill. mean, even unvaccineted theres really small chance going hospital. isnt bubonics plauge (thank god). Especially age distribution vaccines. Younger people much less vaccinated arent much danger really. Consistency hobgoblin small minds. I'm sure one literate would tell that.

Look Jan6 theories well conflict see need consistency. considered essential critical infrastructure? CA, manufacturing considered critical infrastructure meant keep going work, get early benefits essential workers got like early registration vaccines such. fans vaccine holdouts large overlap lot spread.

This worldwide deal. love sportsball attending games something really miss. long COVID denial sports fandom go hand hand, refraining attending games despite vaccinated. CDC yesterday new mask requirements stem viral loads infected vaccinated people different unvaxxed. yes, spread other. Vanilla. new one yet. flu like symptoms: congestion, runny nose, mild cough body aches. I‚Äôm pretty healthy relatively fit, unless takes turn worse next days I‚Äôm concerned. part getting vaccine also still got covid lol CVS carries Abbott lateral flow tests $20 pack two.

Take test home get results 15 minutes. They‚Äôre accurate PCR test feel like they‚Äôre good compromise occasional sniffles fever. Novavax, hell happened them? heard Novavax news months. trials still going on? get delayed due Delta something? Last time checked, vaccine gives small portion covid virus. prone spread around system. Israeli data indicates rapidly waning immunity going month backwards people got shots. They're 39% effectiveness Pfizer Delta last reporting period (late June-mid July). reporting period 64% earlier June. depends got shot. still 75% effectiveness April second dose cohort. I'm glad mine early May due state opening eligibility almost dead last US. I‚Äôve shared bunch times exposed Covid party last month one else party got it. 

I also exposed Covid two weeks ago didn‚Äôt get it. needed national database months ago banning everyone air travel, federal buildings, etc. Put rules place anyone hiring folks federal dollars must 100% vaccination policies. want know long rhinovirus would protected? one issue pre 12 cant get vaccine yet that's huge number amusement park goers. also greater corruption incompetence small governing bodies though. magic formula.  think know Freedom Movement protects constitution. prevents federal government banning individuals leaving certain states (For example, federal government cannot ban Floridians leaving Florida), also bans federal government banning individuals entering states (For example, federal government cannot quarantine entire state). law almost entirely preventing federal government regulating state travel. Individual states still allowed control egress ingress.

What Freedom Movement \*does do\*: 

* prevent states stopping entry state. still control border.
* stop state federal government blocking criminal activities across borders (For example, despite increasingly legally shakey situation cannabis, still illegal cross state border possessing cannabis. also cannot force someone across state border will.)
* prevent federal government refusing issue passports individuals. Even though may cause difficulty borders.

As vaccines, remains seen policy-makers think risks. I'd certainly take booster offered tomorrow, that's option US right now. one case governments *absolutely* provide grants pharmaceutical companies involved vaccine development production. They're forgoing profit interest public good, sort egalitarian corporate behavior lauded encouraged.  Exactly. seems childish embarrassed something nationality Someone tell SEPTA Philadelphia. believe ""promotion education"" without enforcement work. mean masked right reading even though vaccinated live someone can‚Äôt get vaccinated high risk. Encouraging think it‚Äôs important add blood donors likely vaccinate general population.  Twice day! :) It‚Äôs new. Moderna working mRNA treatments years (maybe decade). 

Traditionally, vaccines aren‚Äôt profitable. new fangled mRNA vaccine MMR isn‚Äôt going make much high production costs competition sells dollars.

So now, it‚Äôs like people hate masks hate vaccines people left still wear mask work. gov‚Äôt needs start reporting covid stats categorized vaccinated unvaxxed. Make painfully obvious what‚Äôs going here. completely packed now. I'm shocked see 2 masks trip wdym viral load 1000x more? thought vital load depends initial exposure. delta replicate fast that's trick? One would hope, kinda freaked first, read title chart second. different vaccines there, NONE uses live virus.

This problem. People quite literally making decision based nonsense, rather facts.

As species, we're fucked. Yep. learn virus, I‚Äôm sure exactly options. get vaccinated, get Covid. There‚Äôs going anyone hasn‚Äôt done one within next year two. I‚Äôm glad among vaccinated. healthcare system couple million deaths

This always major danger COVID. healthcare system becomes non-functional due capacity issues, MANY people life threatening emergencies COVID likely die due access issues. I'll admit strongest grasp. change fact going happen I'm glad weak idea.  mush brains, lot wants wear mask. insane. thing Norway last year. Summer hollidays saw downtick schools back session.

[UCSF article claiming J&amp;J 100% effective (March claims vaccine 100% effective defined CDC (April UCSF Pfizer lied? dont get vaccine still work home then? would actually reward people not. dont source 97% seems way high

Of course know happen post hoc rationalization people already determined get vaccinated grasping straws come good reason why. basically day one. managed get somehow early Jan missed everyone gotten it. Nature‚Äôs vaccine. Good luck people chose hard way. I‚Äôm Pfizer trial. week we‚Äôre supposed answer yes/no survey asks we‚Äôve felt Covid symptoms last week. 

I would certainly report yes felt them, so‚Ä¶ vague. easily ascribed things. Like one symptoms diarrhea. Yeah, could covid, could ten beers drank last night. 

But that‚Äôs basically they‚Äôre tracking study level. report yes, ask use self-test kit provided send courier pick up. may also ask come test. it‚Äôs positive, that‚Äôs another data point long someone vaccinated went catching virus. Oh respond comments fat, hating life, meds help depression anxiety.

It's RoundUp, water supply. much obvious be? research N95 masks reducing infection risk wearer? Last remember reading poorly ventilated areas basically screwed matter what. Also crazy since covid vaccine Bro hell getting data? number 6k hospitalizations deaths July 19, 2021, 161 million people United States fully vaccinated COVID-19.

During time, CDC received reports 49 U.S. states territories 5,914 patients COVID-19 vaccine breakthrough infection hospitalized died.‚Äù

6000/161000000=0.0037% chance hospitalization death vaccine‚Ä¶ worried flu. think line reasoning pretty uncommon sub.

- vaccine created = CDC recommends wearing mask

- Vaccine created viral load breakthrough **Alpha** infections really small = CDC recommends keeping mask unless vaccinated, case take off

- Viral load breakthrough **Delta** infections observed significant = CDC recommends put mask back on, vaccinated not.

All makes sense me, get people upset.

*""When car moving told put seat-belt. stopped moving said okay took seat-belt off. moving wear seat-belt again??? Hello?

My viewpoint anything makes pandemic worse useless many people vaccinated false sense ""Now go party"", we're heading another spike school around corner.

So perspective vaccine seems useless point preventing people least US taking proper precautions. look timeline came spike prior vaccine rollout, masks social distancing majority work reduce spread vaccines rolled people seem care think safe, thus spike we're heading going likely much larger peak case high January. 

Which basically tossing effort put beat away. frustration mostly kids, grow world covid norm. implication effect society beyond comprehension. agree extent. definitely don‚Äôt want see people die, regardless vaccination status. point, though, consider fact unvaccinated people US willingly taking risk getting sick dying COVID despite preventative measure widely available free. It‚Äôs like trying desperately get people wear seatbelts driving. small segment people absolutely refused wear seatbelts, would come point would let live decision. No, wouldn‚Äôt want die, steadfastly refused take basic safety measures, do? Stop everyone else driving reduce chances people getting wreck? Obviously, that‚Äôs perfect analogy, don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre quite stage ‚Äúthey‚Äôre taking risk, let want‚Äù (because stuff like breakthrough cases, unvaccinated children, small portion population legitimate reasons unvaccinated, etc.), we‚Äôll get point, can‚Äôt remain perpetual state emergency bunch people don‚Äôt want protect themselves.

It's best way helping poor either.

Every single thing administration, others done, impermanent easily defeated. need significant, lasting reform.

""But can't it, let perfect enemy good."" Well, agree, point, point passed three stimulus measures ago. appetite spending finite, even among moderate democrats, even significant reform. 

I want us spend wisely. want us build things fix things it, want us reform things make lasting changes. Stimulating consumer spending service industry redistribute wealth lasting way. historic reduction poverty we've seen recent memory fleeting illusion. I'm curious something: would anyone's health insurance continue cover refuse vaccinate? seems like really poor business decision, no?  Public health officials able communicate effectively public. That's basic component job. many though want beer burger ? I'm sure people prob say screw . endorse encourage city state governments give 100 dollar incentives people get first shot. Thats thing though, dozens millions people. medicine, everything risk risk vaccine lower disease. public needs told, vaccine flawless. Oh my, sorry hear this. hope gets lots rest recovers soon. Sending positive vibes! correct. reported 44% cases vaccinated people. anybody says anything. contradict earlier findings 87% symptomatic infection. people vaccinated make greater proportion cases virtue fewer fewer unvaccinated people.

Honestly, I'm sick tone deaf person is, hope spite point.   Weird thing is, everyone vax except initial contact, symptoms lot lighter wife has. lost sense smell full body aches. mom sure haven‚Äôt gotten update. vax least. Absolutely get vaccinated people aren‚Äôt ants. That‚Äôs why. good, good mRNA vaccines seems consensus except beta variant really struggled (I think beta SA variant?)

Bigger issue/stain around 1 50k chance serious blood clots especially younger people based data Europe Canada really used countries access mRNA vaccines countries gave first dose AZ switched mRNA second dose

HCM CITY ‚Äî HCM City considering¬†extending current social distancing period one to¬†two¬†weeks¬†as part effort¬†to curb increasing number COVID-19 cases, Phan VƒÉn M√£i, deputy secretary¬†of HCM City Party Committee, said a¬†press meeting Wednesday.

I assume they're people critical others authentic selves, whatever, even wretches need get vaccinated. Reading headline gives migraine. Actively sabotaging vaccination effort. seems we've abandoned science data feelings point. I'm starting understand antimaskers antivaxxers come be, people supposed make decisions based evidence science tend tune trust even they're right. present facts data intermix personal beliefs, emotion, value judgements. Small town plus close knit Churches. mentioning idea getting vaccine get ostracized. cocktail may answer uncommon breakthrough COVID cases put risk

I would gladly pay vaxxed driver shield put front seats back... Every jurisdiction different, including well plan, anticipate, act, react, review communicate. Different areas people react advice, mandates restrictions different ways. one right answer.

We're struggling global pandemic. going perfect. reduce death toll cooperative. us remember courageous patience throughout event. honestly, less so. probably quite bit that. also likely lot bad actors purposely eroding public confidence vaccine too.

A lot use similar talking points to. Quoting Well, sounds like brothers managed dodge process getting vaccinated.

I think mother necessarily anti Vax either, vaccinated, see pressing issue. Downplaying potential complications young adults led this.

While many get severely ill, know less longterm complications covid vaccine. actually treatment options rare complications occur vaccine, still really great treatment options covid severe cases. severe case happen child young adult, devastating family. also largely preventable kids 12 up. family dynamic toxic forgoing public health measure secret maybe cut family ties. I‚Äôm none things. I‚Äôm dude average intelligence lol.

Alright, get it. need context. 

That‚Äôs fair. 

Of course, 13 hours obvious outlier. It‚Äôs anecdotal; may wait long doesn‚Äôt mean everyone does, obviously.

we could away pretty quickly comorbidity low-iq facebook psyops memes. That's vaccinated secret. Like common cold. people could possibly turn would people whole $3000 worth nothing. However, statistically speaking, people would already vaccinated now, since anyone wealthy likely intelligent enough understand importance 9f getting vaccinated. don‚Äôt think inept‚Ä¶

Maybe bad communicating, situation changes rapidly said two weeks ago (which might true time) might longer apply‚Ä¶. Exactly, I‚Äôm perfectly fine mitigation measures vaccines approved kids two older, that, assuming variant doesn‚Äôt come along makes vaccines ineffective preventing severe disease, I‚Äôm willing live like 2020. Sadly no, they‚Äôll make shitty excuse wear mask. Thank extremely detailed response. share frustration. There‚Äôs clear messaging CDC vaccine efficacy vs delta variant. least none I‚Äôve seen ‚ÄúResearch‚Äù seems important word legitimize sitting toilet cell phone reading One America Network website. us soup snacks stocked case bunch side effects nada.

Already forced weekly nose swabs already.  Stay safe folks protect loved ones vulnerable people come contact with. Except lol. really, truly did. Well worry much vaccinated rate delta variant spreading!   Rural Missouri compared Saint Louis Kansas City totally different world friend sending daughter Syndrome, masked, miserable home, nervous it. Every week change minds. proves even fully know answers. unnerving meant originally. sure vaccine cure, lot people including said ""let's it"". 

Just last week stated people dying covid non vaccinated ones. said running wild states least vaccinated. vaccine randomly might work? I'm sorry weird me. 

I part they're unsure. Yet again... I‚Äôm practically dancing point joy.

Fully vaccinated people still get spread virus, it‚Äôs bodies know fight vaccine unless immunocompromised likely won‚Äôt even get sick it. also better job limiting viruses reproduction intubation period makes *less* risky spread virus kind significant capacity, entirely reduce it.

So wear mask even you‚Äôre vaccinated enough anti-vaxxers come senses help us herd immunity people immunocompromised *can‚Äôt* get vaccine safe :) never responded accusations fat, depressed, drowning debt, dad loves you. They're something right Taiwan. dramatic, genuinely Austin ISD offer families remote option fall, Texas lawmakers failed pass bill would funded virtual instruction. Texas also banned mask mandates, including public schools. means Elizalde can't require masks classrooms, says increased anxiety among parents ‚Äî respects concerns.  Thanks! MIS-C, might uncertain long-term effects, optimistic. looks normal enough now. Delta changed things. UK Alpha control Delta arrived. variant like Delta inevitable. best hope sufficient community immunity contain (not eradicate) it. Today: 710,000 shots, 452,000 first shots.

Last Week: 661,000 new shots, 397,000 first shots Welp, I'm vaccinated, live live, die, die

i‚Äôm worried permanent disability. can't imagine unvaxxed (no matter personal financial status) government waving $3,000 stimulus check still declining. $500, see folks telling shove check back Biden's ass. 

But $3,000? could turn down? thought‚Äîthis set CDC guidelines honestly may last forever, since they‚Äôre dependent community spread blanket requirement. totally seeing ongoing recommendation Covid spread high, CDC says one wear mask indoors. 

But change actual human behavior. People (myself included) order burgers less well-done time. CDC says one shouldn‚Äôt that‚Äîall ground beef always cooked well-done. maybe recommendation started instead blanket removal. toothpaste tube, anxious, likely fully vaccinated people donning masks again. eventually see people dropping it, even CDC recommendation stays forever. Covid stay. Finally. Hey least admit you‚Äôre idiot. Sad say real bravery. families kinds people believe Trump last election. There's reasoning people. Either they'll realize they're cult break free won't, definitely stop catering delusions public policy. Cool handle! Well shit, got vaccinated January. even still, unvaccinated people wearing mask going highly populated amusement park decision. know risk actively putting danger. 

Why vaccinated people wear masks try protect idiots won‚Äôt get vaccinated?? even sure excess death data right, seems truer Rural Missourian here, 100% confirm story someone gives covid shots promise snitches, see nothing. happy getting shot. don‚Äôt think need sorry living life. you‚Äôve vaccinated mask indoors, much else cross fingers, clench buttcheeks try get small joys life. here, wore mask stayed home fully vaccinated. point CDC even seem making decisions based science reason much emotional public pressure, whether that's organic pressure driven media know.

If store private entity asks wear mask respect otherwise I'm done, I'm illusion anything security theater vaccinated point. like telling I'm part reason city burning I'm smoking cigarette half population going around dumping gasoline throwing molotovs place. really requirement health insurance. they? show me? I‚Äôm isn‚Äôt scary thing really. think always inevitability.

Just get boosters year like flu vaccine likely little worry about. here. People reporting things like ""my facility 65% vaccinated 10% people using masks hallways."" people going jail deserve Yep. worst message could sent many people refusing vaccines. drive home message delta spreading among unvaxxed maybe start restrictions unvaccinated vaccinated! Yep, last read almost gone, polio cases world vaccine induced (those 1 2.4 million). know they're making concerted effort eradicate all, easier eradicate smallpox back day.

Unrelated since we're talking eradications, pleasantly surprised find rabies considered eradicated Italy. cases wild animals like foxes border region (after 13 years previous ""eradication""), dropped vaccine traps planes forests area (including outside border, Austria Slovenia) worked. single case since, they're still dropping vaccines area caution.

The rabies vaccine still recommended dogs still give vaccine+immunoglobulins get bitten wild animal, actually surprised found eradicated. Unfortunately, 1 shot really inhibit delta much. That's major difference we've found UK - alpha could basically win battle vs covid single dose, stopped enough transmission. delta need both. Change word unvaccinated Jewish would fit right 85 years ago Germany‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs new ‚Äúcoming closet‚Äù deliver free. ends around $10 per test.

We don‚Äôt health much make sure we‚Äôre putting others around us risk. Thanks fam  Pointing Oklahoma cannot provide health care residents doesn‚Äôt tell us much problem covid infections spread. also case 2019 prior. continue long state exists. Nope since it‚Äôs emergency aid aren‚Äôt liable least Small face, smaller brain, less thinking, less problems apologies. 50K going Disney everyday gonna tell 99.9% vaccinated? that‚Äôs amount masks worn. matter it‚Äôs rare. Disney‚Äôs rule unvaccinated wear masks inside. nobody It‚Äôs expecting me, 20 something vaccinated single adult, live like autoimmune issue that‚Äôs problem.

I‚Äôm going stop meeting friends going back office. It‚Äôs happening. People pissed asked, carry people didn‚Äôt. Again. It‚Äôs reasonable thing pissed about. stop there? hell body right, good society let government force people. Maybe forcing birth control poor populations can't afford children rather subsidizing tax credits.

As vaccinated person I'm willing go slope. ‚Ä¶ wasn‚Äôt right, though? Look what‚Äôs going Delta. impending doom worried about. shift goal zero COVID essentially? flu every year? - COVID shots much effective flu vaccines. Hospitalizations/Deaths metric matters. mask vaccinated person, give pressure anymore required. look objectively, invasive species taken world busy destroying it. Yeah long get Vax around unvaccinated ppl worries. That's mask mandate lifted like 40% Vax coverage  great, get next two years - however long take.  Good you, emergency can‚Äôt last indefinitely we‚Äôve vested governor‚Äôs near autocratic power. It‚Äôs time decisions move back legislatures, least. people Union complain Socialism. US started doses early December. first vaccinated Jan. 5 2021. People trying dismiss Isreals' data inclined follow since time frame immunizations US. disheartening see data sure. reality need proactive start discussing booster shots sooner rather later people high risk categories like myself. people vested investment ties big tech, pharma, e-commerce stocks benefits 

my novavax Sea Ltd (e-commerce online games) stock making huge bucks. happening everywhere, Missouri sad, everything said sounds like satirical sketch ... real terrifying. ‚Äú99% hospitalizations/deaths due unvaccinated‚Äù headlines last week still hold true media/CDC done complete 180? Meh, don‚Äôt - I‚Äôve tried give concept deservedness, can‚Äôt shake feeling humans don‚Äôt deserve beautiful world inhabit, least basis collective actions.

But heart definitely people think critically yet still put risk or, broadly context pandemic, simply dragged ignorant. reason instructions soap. Next be, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre weakening immune systems getting shot. can‚Äôt exposed plethora variants don‚Äôt allow virus mutate‚Äù roughly, including fine people Reddit situation üòî  person complaining vaccinated. suspect large number people cautious getting vaccine watching first rounds went ... really anti-vax cautious. sudden case numbers started falling like crazy, decided point covid risk bad they'd coast rest ( seemingly disappearing ) pandemic backs already vaccinated.

Then delta showed up. Curve ball. Scotland also left Euro2020 late June, week case numbers started plummeting there. plans potentially go back college Spring 2022 semester new degree.

Now I‚Äôm honestly re-evaluating considering trying enter workforce degree now, political science, since don‚Äôt want online learning, Delta makes unconfident they‚Äôll semblance normality January.

I‚Äôm thinking might save go back Fall 2022 even Fall 2023 things calm down, possibly find way pay without financial support parents, getting ready retirement. Well, that's concerning. people test positive decide still travel, they're worst kind selfish. people need stopped, person testing speak prevent traveling, good testing people shots? might well let everyone card go through, unchecked...

Look actual data though, numbers. infect others sure, cigarette smokers accidentally start fires. measurably significant, unvaccinated especially unmasked unvaccinated people, gasoline molotov throwers, almost entirely insignificant practice.

The fact media whoever *now* pushing narrative vaccinated people still get sick spread personally serves reenforce skepticism even. shown data since trials prior emergency use authorization vaccinated people get infected even die, anyone seriously illusion impossible us spread it? 

This news, old info. I've heard reported along outlets acting like new info. fact they're repeatedly pushing info though new info comes across pushing agenda rather trying disseminate actual facts data. seems disingenuous even news much less social media always coupled emotion judgement values, objectivity lost. Sorry comes across snarky.. concerns long term side effects COVID itself? 

Just trying understand you‚Äôre coming from. Personally I‚Äôd much rather ‚Äútake chances‚Äù vaccine, ultimately getting real COVID dealing side effects. German soldiers dangerous (1939), German soldiers allies (2020). Theres inconsistancy include context. possible people like paid nation states simply want drag countries level? Propaganda. see seven men. experimental antiviral called 'DRACO' protect pretty much viruses. 
 
How works instead producing virus specific antibodies attack virus may protect viruses - instead 'DRACO' substance waits body - within bodies cells perhaps - virus infects cell DRACO hijacks virus soon enters cell rewires part virus destroy said infected cell. Virus infects cell, injects virus code cell - DRACO attaches self destruct code onto virus infection code - cell reads virus code see's self destruct code cell thus self destructs. substance designed specifically detect whether infection happens. 
 
So means like substance probably protect flu virus, COVID 19.. Common cold.. Etc.. 
 
Though substance maybe antiviral actual vaccine - still could last maybe actually make DRACO actual vaccine somehow getting body produce DRACO itself.

And furthermore get infected - maybe later bodies antibodies wear vaccine wears get reinfected - maybe infected mutated variant meaning body gets even permanent damage dealt body. reinfection making body worse time - maybe lowering survival rate time maybe exponentially. Getting really hard feel sympathy nonvaccinated folks. I'm trying man, make easy.  Good, like polio vaccines, take get work go school. Novavax traditional, wish EUA, would way easier get resistant people vaccinated. boosters rolled need want them. point decide risk not. 30 particularly fearful getting sick (and WFH quarantined!) boosters unnecessary. 60+ like socialize &amp; frequent tight crowded venues probably get 3rd shot. going mandatory. decide what's best health &amp; safety. point masking mandates dropped. least doesn‚Äôt microchips. going take.

these two different ""ideals"". 

you're apparently choosing #2, *literal* detriment society so. I‚Äôll continue wear mask zero proof working save person Covid. I‚Äôll continue use healthy immune system ward illness.

you're f*cking moron. I‚Äôll things happily, health lack therein zero bearing another person.

you're f*cking moron understanding reckless behavior endangering around you. someone explain shouldn‚Äôt freak ‚Äú40% hospitalized UK vaccinated‚Äù headlines? forgot math checked out‚Ä¶ obviously 40% number doesn‚Äôt tell many vaccinated people overall getting hospitalized, hospital capacity. point?

The parents antivax organized enough shit together enough get 12-18 year olds vaccinated. month ago. Great question! like got sick flu even getting shot, didn‚Äôt end hospital. goes covid. 
I know somebody fought life 29 last year Covid. Thanks vaccines, chances seeing someone go much lower. Yeah, know. sucks fair. hate old system heard exact arguments things like hepatitis HIV. yeah thats trying say Masks much without vaccines, masks without vaccines basic coming terms fact may get sick COVID point (though severely vaccinated), never get this. right. spirit anti-vaxxers, going accuracy. never covid (don't think) , maybe might ahead Majority people won‚Äôt die covid. That‚Äôs facts. anyone experienced diarrhea vomiting getting first dose Pfizer? dad got two weeks ago sunday hour later started diarrhea cramps lasted tuesday morning, also got small fever threw around 5 times he's scared getting second dose fast side effects hit him. Thank you.  84k where?

Uk? +31,117	

Where getting numbers from?

Even 84k, 85 fatalities.

With numbers, would least 1.5k last year.  We‚Äôre supposed gowninf putting N95s we‚Äôre known Covid patients room. hospital isn‚Äôt testing covid anymore ER unless person symptomatic would sacrifice freedom safety deserve neither. Especially since sacrificing behalf population, yourself. Got vaccine, that's got left Hospitalization death trend actually going DC.  They'll get shot, spend money keep spewing anti-vax shit la fox news hosts.  Curious, vaccines get shoutout, got sick? user day said vaccinated someone close would disown did.

Depending level relationship, worst thing teach young person. never want teach young person body theirs, especially girls. would kick person life attempted regulate another person's body try influence another person controlled body. really wrong couple levels. pay attention money, bribe charge fees.  That's liberal thinking /s. 

It isn't, act like it. Nearly quarter unvaccinated people \*household\* income $25,000, half household income $50,000. Nearly 50% unvaccinated people making $35,000 cite side effects reason vaccinated -- presumably tied fear missing work. $100 joke. another stimulus check tied vaccination status!

This stinginess combined fact want vaccinated, asymptomatic people test potentially miss work \*unpaid\* sniffles less means we're going get point large scale business cancelations (travel, return office, whatever), impacting business district restaurants, travel, live events. going result bailout airlines something equally expensive. delta faster? read somewhere original could take 2 weeks symptoms appear delta usually takes 2 days. That, chance hospitalized, chance spreading others maybe sickening killing them, real risk ""long Covid"" months years.

It may convenient comfortable pretend huge, serious risks, delusional. basically everyone point.  Insurance go everyone unvaccinated. serious argument made shoulder cost. ""I think need worry!""

The people know Corona right vaccinated... It‚Äôll time get Pfizer booster couple months. $500 per shot then. masked eating leads nuance effective mask wearing 100% time. mild case could also vaccinated. Little different. Joe wearing seatbelt isn‚Äôt going kill Samantha. Joe getting vaccine could lead death Samantha. gym Nats games go to, less 10%. office, less 5%. DC. So, much YMMV. symptoms? I‚Äôd prefer catch anything well, help it. Scheduled tomorrow! Anecdotal wife's BFF got Corona vaccinated awhile back sick fuck. Much like going church. good portion people seem listen sermon, showed others could see attended. What‚Äôs $100 going someone entire identity revolves around getting vaccine. better this. humans operating centuries. Yet acting humans never found setting. There‚Äôs one difference sets present day history apart‚Ä¶social media giving low self-esteem individuals platform troll on. open borders. Well that's enough go get it. cash form store coupons kind credit/gift card? understand sentiment would wise consider curtailing basic liberty misused wrong hands. 

The problem isn‚Äôt Charlie Kirk, problem there‚Äôs market people like Charlie Kirk. amount laws change that. People talking UK's drop cases, Netherlands' even impressive imo I'm wondering 16-19 rates increase fall schools start in-house vaccination drives. probably peer pressure kicking potential excused absence. high school ages ago, blood drives always hugely successful two reasons. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Why ppl thinking next wave former ones?

Lot ppl vaccinated/ lots ppl antibodies previous sickness.

Situation different last year.

I understand seeing India sick like april traumatic could cause panic.

But India barelly first/second wave third wave struck Europe USA twice before...

World needs stop panicking.

Covid stay, third wave wont painfull waves coming neither. (more antibodies less severe waves)

Humanity overcomed much worser diseases without vaccination (black death).

No virus lasts forever initial strenght. Mutation not. 3yo son tested positive close contact daily. Headache hit ~10-11 days close contact kid daycare. symptoms indications positive. One common question conspiracy theories ""whats goal?"" Like purpose ""to control us"" well shit break google already knows shit jack probably knows friends family combined. need microchip control always find weird people mention losing sense smell symptom. i'm sick congested cant smell shit anyways. Haha! I'll pass onto them! Where‚Äôs ‚ÄúInjun Joe need him? go work social activities. need wear mask. 

You still catch spread COVID. took original strain 20 minutes cause infection, delta seconds. prevent wear mask inside crowds. 

That's it. That's do. fair closed nightclubs again, arguably biggest superspreading locations  ‚ÄúAnti-social good. Social bad‚Äù.

Reddit Redditor logic finest. Lol pouting so-called pouting. counterargument want share? Moderna kidcove study site close us. allocated 100 slots. families signed up. definite want!

This one frustrating things way Biden/Fauci/the FDA handled situation. There's demand, get focus adults due risks greater adults, demand vaccines kids overwhelming enough talking least weekly daily. also try find way strongarm state governments implementing mask mandates measures protect Someone posted ACIP slides July 10 meeting. real reasons urging increase enrollment numbers detection specific AEs, power so.

I can't find slides July 10th meeting [the ACIP took look July 22nd one mention kids mention cases myocarditis (which still sounds extremely rare.) However, seem like something common younger people absolutely want kid vaccinated, risk threshold much higher kids kids get vaccinated, delays mean absolute attention given safety.

I agree. situation, there's chance children inherited brain bleed disorder would like avoid COVID would otherwise. Freedom choice! (As long choice choice üôÑ) managed get nearly 90% without cash incentives like lot places America barring non-vaccinated people bars restaurants like France. 

No idea UK lumped two headline. I‚Äôm healthcare quite frankly it‚Äôs shame Healthcare Systems across US haven‚Äôt taken lead issue. 

Mandatory vaccines Healthcare Workers happened yesterday. Unvaxxed HCW‚Äôs disgrace profession represent MASSIVE risk patient staff safety. 

Don‚Äôt want vaccine? Fine, respect (poor) decision, can‚Äôt work hospital. India heartbreaking earlier year. soul-crushing watching footage people burning parents street, crematories room, watching people cling onto deceased sibling wait line outside hospital, screaming help. 

People wrote tragedy India ""a poor country"", sort like wrote Wuhan's epidemic due China, start pandemic. 

India largely unaffected entire pandemic though facing virus faced. quickly turned place oxygen tankers guarded armed men.  
It hard appreciate much tragedy able avoid due vaccine rolled time. escaped across Atlantic ocean free mother's toxicity. fully understand support you! well :) ""vaccines"" FDA approved actual vaccine, experimental biological agent? trouble finding answer that. VITT blood clot rate 5/100,000 means 50,000 people got blood clots AZ. 

Not seeing data studies, however. I'm hoping here. know half people work with, small office vaccinated. 3/6. wear mask. health care professionals didnt' think covid serious enough run studies children recently, want continue lockdowns preventative measures cover another one mistakes. Saying believe science like saying believe 2+2=4 believe gravity. 

Also science, try diaproven. go around spreading Information things work, rather, go around try diaproven. Theories claims must tested questioned, that's science. 

If told question, doubt, that's Grade-A cult/religion. 

There reasons many groups hate ""free thinkers"" history mankind. Convince Masks work. scientific, research based, peer reviewed study conclusively determines masks substantially effective stopping spread CV. HARM and/or moreso substantial transmission vaccinated people justify forcing masks rule law.  


Please abstain name calling, political references REALLY BAD ANALOGIES! Give legit research support edicts. DC issued mask mandate, recommendation. also hospitalizations near record lows.

If accept this, wearing masks till next summer third city get vaccinated matter many gift cards give. Covid going away, vaccinated able wear mask feel like it. comply anymore. everyone supermarket get car crash simply building someone will.

With Rona, especially Delta, likely get everyone household. Sure, might ok, really want take chance? realize you, everyone interact everyone interact with.

I realize selfish ass holes realize fact. 

People would rather million others die put fucking mask. it.

Says need know half united States.  listen CDC, going listen governor. look stats. VAST majority cases driving wave unvaccinated. called went directly voicemail. picked months. It‚Äôs well known viruses react poorly pouting. So, appreciate everyone thread part pouty children. fact surprising people strange. lot people bitching vaccines vaccinated, won‚Äôt admit it. Like many people never admit voted Dump secret. promise many business owners, well liberals voted dipshit purely taxes. highest US get 70% vaccinated, take account homeless, mental illness, religion, lack trust government. truly arrived [Idiocracy  ]( ) lifted mask restrictions June, based honor system. cases sky rocketing, nows back masks everyone here.  Canada glut doses absolutely offering this. Fuck missouri (misery). Fuck people there, hope bodies start piling entire state becomes national forest. USA really managed fail extremely badly vaccinating people. 80+% population two jabs already. Electing science deniers powerful positions consequences seems. Imagine upset someone else get vaccine? Masks mandatory yet here. were, lifted public spaces going to? 

I live Northwest DC near Cathedral. Gym? Maybe one two masks now. Restaurants? Packed. Grocery store? Half masked best. They'll require vaccination, fine. like last year. mask mandates place people ""vaccinated?"" rapture happening, way thought would. Thank you. I'm much better since stopped hanging family going back home town. :) gonna help. one two vaccinations works. hearts minds right place little late. sure surprising. Britain high vaccination rates among people ~ 30, sure exact age, low vaccinations age. current wave probably blew population. Also, school terms ended, testing rates may dropped. It‚Äôs probably combination two. Cases may go back fall/winter respiratory diseases tend spread easily schools back session. 

The part different testing rates cases dumb metric use. Better look hospitalizations. agree think fake ID usage underage . stop fully , would result reduction people want put effort.  man drowning, boat came, man

I'm vaccinated get booster time comes sad community standing like needs to, vaccine clinic monday. 139 new vaccinations. 


People ignorant stupid. study convincing me, one person group first super small say lingering symptom(s) is. person could immunocompromised something else. also took place prior Delta variant wave, seen research long Covid symptoms post Delta, seem symptoms changed varient people insisted wouldn‚Äôt ‚Äúlive fear.‚Äù know still get severe Covid it‚Äôs lingering symptoms vaccinated right? here. They‚Äôre trying encourage people go back I‚Äôm going unless forced people aren‚Äôt required vaxxed. Florida reports 17,589 new cases July 28th 2021 July 29th report according not. proponent vaccinations readily available including kids. vaccines ok masking guidelines staying place. available everyone ample time gain immunity remove them.  pissed cause husband got covid, last week got tested fertility cause sure pregnant needed look potential stuff. fine.

Literally week later Covid puts male fertility risk. 27.

He able get vaccine due at, like fault there.

Seriously fuckkkk this. average daily vaccination rate past week 587,000 shots per day. can't that. significant portion hospitalizations deaths *may* ultimately caused transmission vaccinated person

So evidence, hunch, huh? NC. lab version insurance said lab network. can‚Äôt question vaccines around get downvoted. It‚Äôs healthy skepticism vaccine efficacy waining, delta variant shown success piercing it, decrease chance getting long Covid all. you‚Äôre young unvaccinated, risk getting long Covid vaccinated, yes, vaccines silver bullet told about. answer end pandemic looks like. $40? That‚Äôs laughable guess better nothing really want know. Vaccinated people getting pregnant... research effects development fetus child born, etc. ideally, effects. But, might see kids 4-5 years, born vaccinated parents, end developmental issues, etc. Interesting, live? I‚Äôm London connection speeds mental since vax chip went online Lol, Los Angeles rural conservative. must well traveled. heard story nurses got fired spreading anti-maskers vaccine social media. hospital tolerate knowing endanger patients colleague. free country work somewhere else. know third shot fewer side effects terms traditional fever, fatigue etc.? see irony calling someone else panic attack talking caps. seem crazy. Take look seroprevelance monitored age groups hit near 90% immunity either vaccinations natural immunity honestly assume people wearing masks likely vaxxed care taking precautions. I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs people can‚Äôt take medical reasons legitimate concerns aren‚Äôt assholes gotta believe people masked vaxxed safe. confirm, telling parents biggest mistake ever made. worried going become infertile pulled lot info Facebook ""horror stories."" stepdad especially problematic considering narcissist: really thought vaccines conspiracy, one right politically, media blah blah blah.

So simply lied got anyways :) Wooow COVID test forms typically ask vaccination. Oh, think actually right one. Fractions man, work? recent cdc mask recommendations mainly prevent unvaccinated becoming infected? OP husband's coworker died April. got sick covid August vaccine approved went vent weeks. took eight months die worked almost whole time, sick, America. shocking. know, live here. worries. Also, American. kinda paid attention AZ cause half family got J&amp;J pause. Maryland one R governors that's Covid denying nutcase. vaccine numbers well national average. Although agree ur sentiment completely stated before, I‚Äôd say dc 60%-70% people already wearing masks public venues don‚Äôt think sway population much Variants likely come rest world heavily unvaccinated. sound like zero-covid proponent, serious position anymore.   timeline messed real. would find new gynecologist well. would imagine ""likely"" probably apply people hospitalized first time (which qualifies severe illness). sorry happened work health care. doubt ever happen. live remote place, human inhabitants. physician well members extended family practice medicine recommended case. respect everyone's individual choice. want get shot, get it. would rather get shot, get it.  Even areas high vaccination, covid still spread quickly. example, Fort Bend County near Houston, 66% 76% full partial vaccination rate 12+. 

It's still experiencing significant surge. covid ICU usage doubled 10% 20%, hospital bed usage 6% 9%, positivity 10.5% 12.5%, last 7 days. Even 66%/76% vaccination rate enough prevent it. They're 58% vaxxed, national average 49%. Yeah seems strange say countries. Could say ""as morons countries x z"" masks. live, still restrictions pretty much everything. example club near allowed 25% capacity groups allowed mingle, pathetic. Still large gatherings can't travel many countries. Cant wait CDC slow walk bureaucratic bullshit flip flops lesser things like masks. Maybe get boosters US December. really stupid live misery...üòÜ It‚Äôs simply government saying it‚Äôs safe. vetted data planet moment. Thousands independent scientists looked safety efficacy data many different ways. One thing scientists trained do, something actually benefits professionally, publish counterintuitive findings back findings data. vaccine dangerous, would news. Every risk found (eg, J&amp;J vaccine increasing certain clotting risks younger women) covered extensively. 

So no, isn‚Äôt shut take it. shut don‚Äôt substantiated data support fear. live society, basic obligation kill people society. failing civic duty putting real people‚Äôs lives stake. People increased risk severe Covid vaccine unlikely effective (eg immunocompromised folks) fears killing. Thinking otherwise actually dangerous. anyone know many people testing vaccinated oppose unvaccinated, test centers even asking questions, ask hospitalized. would good know percent people getting vaccinated.. understand less likely serious condition, stat showing 90%+ testing positive also unvaccinated would reassuring would imply vaccinated getting symptoms enough fall sick require testing Unvaccinated kids crammed schools masks immunity cause variant factory. need vaccine approval younger children even typically severe cases COVID. better chance dying car crash Covid‚Ä¶ everyone scared this? Please inform Well may goal doesn‚Äôt matter effective people don‚Äôt even get lol Actually EMA approved moderna 12-17 might keep well. things seen discussing said one P/M shot J&amp;J booster, none mentioned getting 2. would ask people whatever location get first P/M booster shot second recommended. guess Missouri gone ‚Äúshow me‚Äù state ‚Äúdon‚Äôt show, don‚Äôt tell‚Äù state. I'm glad CDC recommending masks least. thought they'd already picked hill die on, guess willing walk back restrictions necessary. someone say ""They wear masks get spit wounds""

And like think want spit wounds???

No response. issue Israel share they're testing for, test size demographic breakdown. testing antibodies measure, actually carrying randomized double blind studies get numbers? antibodies that's enough conclude efficacy. B Cells, Cells Helper cells play large roles immune system.  people dense? grown ass adults. feels like spectator sport right now. I‚Äôm sitting back, watching people dumb.  don‚Äôt care it. it. Well there‚Äôs billions people won‚Äôt get shot late 2022 earliest. There‚Äôs alpha, beta, gamma, delta, lambda, probably don‚Äôt know about, detected around first 6 months 2021. That‚Äôs almost 1 per month. rate, vaccines won‚Äôt last even end year, pandemic still raging. absolutely right. I've fair share (mentally utterly exhausting) fights 'High IQ contrarians' sheer amount mental gymnastics/ cognitive biases use boggles mind. I'll leave one brilliant gem ""Philosophy better science"".

\- gem occured tried argue scientific method best tool humanity understanding world, despite imperfections . ""It's everyone else's fault! mine"". pandemic eye-opener stupid entire world (not US) is. I'm upper NW WA think rude myself, I'm familiar OC attitudes towards it. would ask either way though. Best case scenario they're vaccinated worry much less. Worst case scenario they're not, sure protect much possible. Information power. cherry picked one worst examples. could likewise cherry pick one lowest hit states I'm equally bad faith argument. people still vote it. Unreal! That's interesting looks like cases peaked around July 2 Scotland. Well last long. Tell jump sales!

Yeah, that‚Äôs sure way get bad data. catching covid US offered vaccine everyone? insane. Fair enough, think actual effects relevant cases, technically correct. still danger others though even vaccine Really irks see people say ‚ÄúIf vaccines work worried whether one wear mask‚Äù 

Well COVID keeps spreading, keep mutating vaccines may effective effective all.

That would great. considering Alpha worse Wuhan, Delta worse Alpha, thats pattern we're seeing. tiny subset people getting infected twice?

Because tiny subset people infected year ago. time goes by, increase. Today learned Pfiezer effectiveness decreases 3% every month. Probably similar natural immunity.  Sorry random, okay post ""vaccines work"" thing r/copypasta? I've posted different COVID-related text gotten several thousand upvotes. Oh. And, per article, also one dumbest admin decisions since pearl harbor. Feel sorry cus suga gonna catch fire abe's arrogance. It‚Äôs not, type people scared injecting potentially dangerous thing bodies, cleared way regular vaccine would partially dissuade fears. Another major thing see people worried lack long term data, exist time FDA approval since vaccines tested year half seems well within ‚Äúnormal/healthy‚Äù range everyday skepticism, maybe bit ‚Äúmore skeptical‚Äù side healthy. 

I think like this: work health policy, even though I‚Äôm clinician directly involved vaccine rollout, wheelhouse, I‚Äôm comfortable applying pretty basic heuristics look various policies/treatments/preventive measures say ‚Äúyup, looks good, I‚Äôm in!‚Äù. 

But say, new water treatment process - that‚Äôs something know much about, yeah, could see bit initial skepticism learned it. 

Sounds like vaccines parents‚Äô version ‚Äúwater treatment‚Äù, needed learn basic details get board. someone deal kinds ignorance health-related propaganda regular, don‚Äôt consider kind light skepticism problem, time world make sure folks like information need get ‚Äúyes‚Äù. But, pandemic phase doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúend‚Äù even highly vaccinated population (see places like SF UK), end? Especially Covid continue endemic. doesn‚Äôt seem clear line anyone wants say, random time future isn‚Äôt defined anything guaranteed even happen. reduction, doesn‚Äôt offer much protection someone wearing mask. $100 ain‚Äôt moving many people lol. common example France. Quite antivax whole, yet people quite serious masks covid. pretty interesting. restrictions going occur without one? Way see Delta tear anti-vaxxers two months cases start dropping we're seeing England. fking insane, fact see problem saying incredible.

I've never seen group eager willingly give rights government like government always people's best interest mind.

Truly idiotic.

And want even tracking database people wtf lmao Ah, mistake, thought said ""chewing *vaccinated* people."" fair enough, unvaccinated I'd concerned. Well, no, I'd go get free vaccine be. 

This care much now. want risk lives I'm going waste energy caring it, that's problem. going maskless unvaccinated prior vaccines unavailable putting everyone else risk. Even expend energy caring much, acted accordingly stayed away people, although would logically agree people upset.  Give $1200 us got vaccinated without asked. Americans there, scaled US population, would preventing 130 million infections 354k deaths. Rewarding \[characterization deleted\] people \[expletive deleted\] behavior somewhat annoys me. completely preventable silent majority gonna even silent keep following people like absurd Olympics ever. Last time swam threw zombie fuck water. time unwatchable. Men competing women women can't compete women manly. Smh.

We become parody ourselves. you‚Äôre fine giving government power decide what‚Äôs true? isn‚Äôt good idea. blame people making decision. blame antivaxers, quite frankly, I'd rather mask mandate restrictions could occur without one. employers starting require it, full FDA approval gets closer, asshats get it, deal ostracized. Ah, great counterargument! Yep. Forester (RIP) informs 90% road riding style. think lot governors giving recommendations wait weeks see things develop.

If Gottlieb ends right peak comes late August, think masks stay ‚Äúrecommended‚Äù now. 

If he‚Äôs wrong cases still rising September, think mask mandates return, they‚Äôll serious talk capacity limits/social distancing returning too. kind world live üôÑ... major religions practiced United States, Church Christ, Scientist (whose adherents known ""Christian Scientists"") Dutch Reformed Church two religious groups openly discourage vaccination. 20% unvaccinated Americans infected covid.

Had vaccinated 90% effective vaccine, 2% would infected. know 50 people, expected one.

Different time periods, different amount virus circulating knowing one even seem notable. Scotland broke month ago. England broke mid-July. Unvaccinated people attack others getting vaccinated dumb

Same goes vaccinated towards unvaccinated people lol

It's personal choice Nope. [Actually something less bad.

But tiny subset people getting infected twice? good, deserved get kicked out. people representing country. immune long variant? feeling severe reaction primarily genetic driven, evidence points autoimmune response driving poor outcomes. Severe illness driven primarily strong immune response rather weak one. Entirely plausible old people die often simply body can't take nearly much damage young person, rather old people weak immune response. people generally unhealthy. Death high particular demographics, severe illness much equally distributed. CDC needs run genetic sequencing everyone hospital Covid-19. number 1 driver severe illness, feel strongly. Here‚Äôs thing. I‚Äôm pro vax, pro mask, totally cautious.

If Pfizer want EUA 5-11 reason. make money selling shots.

If asking privilege provide medicine 5-11yo vaccine demonstrably dangerous population disease is. Full stop.

I toddler home. still cautious. wish still indoor mask mandate. said, Pfizer doesn‚Äôt want EUA kids accept realistic risks happy pushing cure worse disease.

Disclaimer: idiot Reddit, double check everything. responding comment asked half unvaccinated population got delta *in three weeks*. 

70 million infections double confirmed cases we've entire pandemic compressed 3 weeks. would 3.3 million infections per day, 13x higher worst peak last year. Even much lower hospitalization rate, would overwhelm people would normally survive hospitalization might get healthcare need would increase mortality rate. overrun would also cause massive increase non-covid deaths lack access healthcare, entire point ""flatten curve"", prevent catastrophic overrun healthcare industry.

I'm sure UK Singapore would likewise change course saw rapidly increasing hospitalizations like are. is. deal individually happening us regardless others doing. Why? Mandating vaccines United States going keep virus mutating/transmitting throughout rest world. COVID19 stay. People continue die. Vaccines protect choose take it. people recover infected.

Sigh. I'm you. Especially space taken people covid. People covid vaccinated prioritized. reap sow. research I've read indicates per mile cyclists much lower risk pedestrians, higher risk automobile drivers/passengers, much lower risk motorcyclists.

The risk per hour lower cyclists. course based questionable data regarding miles hours traveled annually cyclists.

Nonetheless, increase risks cyclists far outweighed benefits: I'm wrong halfway agree you. Unfortunately still got covid even though I‚Äôm vaccinated. Masks mandated. 

But agree. Vaccines except people allergic (i met one girl gotten reaction every vaccine ended ER, she‚Äôs extremely rare exception).

Keep mind although numbers similar (22,000+) can't really compare bulk population vaccinated, percentage infection groups different even number similar.

Still, indicate vaccinated getting infected. Fortunately, vaccine still keeping number serious cases down, hospital admission rate risen significantly. re-open long ago, might change.

Reference :  TL:DR; Hail corporate asking matters whether person tests positive masked? No. you‚Äôre exposed, get tested. Bad analogies explicitly requested used. Lol. It‚Äôs covid can‚Äôt transmitted public places- it‚Äôs that, short exposures greatly reduce likelihood infection. vast majority infections happen amongst close contacts(friends,family, coworkers) also people feel least need wear masks. That‚Äôs mean mask mandates misdirected. mask mandates focused social gatherings public outings may effective even they‚Äôd really stop 10%-15% infections. 

There plenty data states without mask mandates last summer illustrating spread happening - outside bars/clubs almost amongst close contacts.

Now, despite vaccines exponentially reduce likelihood anyone ending hospital, failed leadership pandemic focus retweets TV appearances resulted embarrassing new stat.  I'm ""anti-vaxxer"" I'm afraid. trust body. Wild right? I'm hearing, gubberment anecdotically, working extremely well, like France. 
Multiple friends mom's never put effort sign scrambling, suddenly asking help, etc.

To honest think government set call center people 60 though. Apparently quite whose doctors sign know despite user friendly website is. people suck using technology.  works vulnerable people (elderly) high vaccination rates.  Imagine hit delta variant get-go... **I want show something lose hope dealing mutations such:** 
 
There experimental antiviral called 'DRACO' protect pretty much viruses. 
 
How works instead producing virus specific antibodies attack virus may protect viruses - antibodies work merely clog surface virus. Instead 'DRACO' substance waits body - within bodies cells perhaps - virus infects cell DRACO hijacks virus soon enters cell rewires part virus destroy said infected cell. Virus infects cell, injects virus code cell - DRACO attaches self destruct code onto virus infection code - cell reads virus code see's self destruct code cell thus self destructs. substance designed specifically detect whether infection happens. 
 
So means like substance probably protect flu virus, COVID 19.. Common cold.. Etc.. 
 
Though substance maybe antiviral actual vaccine - still could last maybe actually make DRACO actual vaccine somehow getting body produce DRACO itself. 
 
Here news article it: 
  
 
Also 90 Survival rate mean virus leaves body undamaged. 
 
The virus causing permanent damage body - stuff like brain damage, lung scarring - make lungs like smoker lungs. 
 
And furthermore get infected - maybe later bodies antibodies wear vaccine wears get reinfected - maybe infected mutated variant meaning body gets even permanent damage dealt body. reinfection making body worse time - maybe lowering survival rate time maybe exponentially. 
 
But right vaccine would keep safe meantime - Pfizer vaccine example already year safe enough. So, need prevent body getting worse worse now. maybe later get 'all purpose' vaccine later target maybe viruses.. said ""no masks 70%!"" 70% enough, what?

Then define number matters, number think connected matters. How, specifically, would detect whether 70% enough not? would enough resulted fewer N deaths? 

Defining terms numbers don't, own, matter would unwise. 

So goal terms vaccination numbers, terms death disability numbers. numbers directly matter. numbers trying affect inherent moral weight. say, believe, anything close becoming 'common cold' within lifetime. likely take centuries. likely remain fatal, mitigated vaccination, antivirals, necessary, NPIs. comparison flu. Post-viral issues flu joke either; live, extent, both. Obviously mitigate harm, balanced everything else. hard would mandate vaccine pandemic kill millions?

What ignorant reason wary. Right. you‚Äôre required hop airplane go Florida weekend, go restaurant, go sporting events, go shopping, etc.

Maybe I‚Äôm dense fail see hasn‚Äôt happened past year without vaccines, possibly happen populace that‚Äôs half vaccinated. think pandemic shown us ill prepared even deadlier disease. acceptable amount loss people wear mask limit gatherings, 1:100, 1:50, 1:25, 1:10, 1:5? number deaths reported today people tested around 30 days ago. typical patient hospitalized COVID spend 2-3 weeks hospital passing away disease. time another week two shows actual figures. I've tracking cases vs deaths since beginning pandemic pretty consistent.

So, given two weeks ago 7 day rolling average around 1800, number people dying today likely closer 30-40, see reflected numbers another week two.

Edit: clarified first sentence Correct. Phew! I'd guess easily half already vaccinated. finished moderna series june 4th. Currently dealing extremely mild illness right now, I'm unsure covid, symptoms track, nausea, diarrhea, sore throat lethargy. Could literally anything though. first 4 days toughest, I'm feeling better. Thank goodness retired part time job work home. lot misinformation vaccine, saying was""rushed"", ""experimental"" government tracing device.
As watch Facebook feed shake head. Currently quarantining second bout. First time (January 2020) messed REAL good. felt like two day cold. Except time complete loss smell taste feels like there's small fire sinuses. Yes, I'd rather see 18s vaccinated UK well, especially parent. I'd least like choice. kids younger I'd definitely get approved age group. 

That said, fact UK regulatory agency determined vaccines risk children covid, US equivalent determined opposite, makes feel like must relatively close thing, I'm rushing blame people get children vaxxed way I'd look 50 year old get vaxxed ended hospital. agree thread upset constant downplaying covid risk--but worth acknowledging different calculation 17 year old parents monsters here. dont need insurance - say uninsured go different location would insurance file. also say unvaccinated. one pros socialized healthcare...as centralized database. Thanks take.

I talked MD today thinks CVS (where scheduled) boot see I'm already state-level DB due getting J&amp;J. Shall see! doubt booster advice either way though, hehe. Seeking civilian still very, um, cutting edge. brother in-law longer speak me. Called government zombie spoken since April. neighbor longer talk saying hard time spending time lack moral integrity. Apparently threw mine got vaccine. idea way. never discussed politics years. ""data"" CDC based updates sketchy. preprint studied 50 people India vaccinated inferior vaccines even approved US. peer review committee rejected sent paper back revisions. Might easiest post article post mention posting calculator comment, add that. Okay that's kinda close. posit *are* numbers, elsewhere. somebody's got numbers. 

I say numbers part larger conversation. experts propose numbers, us agree that's goal line, we're asked play game. I'm sure designing vaccine works everyone opting take said vaccine could line ""god helps help themselves"" know? I‚Äôve looking similar info, I‚Äôll I‚Äôve found mostly conjecture.

It theoretically rare one vaccinated person infect another vaccinated person, especially it‚Äôs asymptotic. I‚Äôd also love see data this. Vaccines slow spread. Reduced viral loads slow rate transmission. Case death rates fell cliff direct result vaccine distribution.

Spread increasing prominence delta variant easily transmissible. least climate change clear financial motive. decided promoting mass death could used wedge issue. 

Ruining earth fossil fuel companies make trillions people drive work cheaper short term? Alright, evil, coherent. Facing deadly pandemic siding virus? Yeah kinda scratching head. Ok that‚Äôs typical crowd makes sense. can‚Äôt imagine they‚Äôd many anti-vaxx customers either compared standard Applebee‚Äôs Chili‚Äôs would lose significant amount business this. Children, starters. People certain autoimmune medical conditions. mention people immune issues *are* vaccinated system underpowered response it, still less protection ""normal"" fully vaccinated person. Last checked can‚Äôt infect others pregnancy, brainiac. Pfizer's trials enrolling kids ages 5-11 maybe already increase size maybe made changes yet. I'm seriously hoping already size FDA looking for. Hey! United Corporations America cares deeply customers would like know sick vaccinated people getting.

This cant go forever, point need treat like flu move lives.

Im sick half facts guesses. want know much fuller picture supplying. That‚Äôs like scene talladega nights use knife get first knife Ricky stuck leg rate innoculation match rate decline. We'd expect number cases fall steadily baseline cases, dramatic sudden drop. politicized... Technically it‚Äôs happening smaller level we‚Äôd like to. vaccinated (or someone strong immunity memory) person infected body knows handle virus effectively rendered something far less likely kill hospitalize host. want larger scale point whether transmit becomes less reason implement restriction people primed handle infection. Useless scare mongering Fox finally started telling people get vaccine. took year realize economy well everyone dies. Big shock. amazing conservatives never smart enough realize sooner things get back normal, money have. me, all, studies mixed shots seem turn better efficacy (so far anyways) point vaccine prevent severe disease.

I've working 6 days/60 hours week 18 months straight. last 6 extremely horrible absolutely one working. thing think I've actually enjoyed last year (besides assassins creed valhalla) mask mandate ended NC, great actually felt like waterboarded 10+ hours day.

I kids decent bit savings. could work fine (I'm lucky know bragging promise). saving try finally buy stuff I've really wanted long time, fuck really might quit can't goddamn stand shit longer. Question- asymptomatic, get shot decide get tested next day show positive? know shot irrelevant case? I'm getting shot tomorrow, getting tested Friday. Unrelated other. Hope that's ironic sense. think ones dock Florida aren't, making things unpleasant unvaxxed passengers. Extra fee, specific (not good) seating areas certain things, things can't do, etc. viral load study? one each? supposed get good Moderna-specific data that? concerned (and get it, anxiety), really N95 masks hand things like doctor‚Äôs appointment. Check Home Depot, many N95s stock.

Your risk severe illness death quite low since you‚Äôre fully vaccinated, age 65, reasonably healthy. wearing good quality mask reduce even further. Double masking help some, improves actual fit mask face. well fitted KN95 KF94 effective double mask setup still leaves gaps air enter. want life return normal got shot waiting second one wear masks everywhere live thus pandamic due stupid people fair let‚Äôs see..still need wear mask, still get get infected, still need get tested?

So motivating unvaccinated get vaccine, again? seriously frustrating. Sorry, fully vaccinated running get tested feel sick. needs end point. [27.6% world population received least one dose COVID-19 vaccine, 14.1% fully need wear masks still, shite frankly. Good point. Even 100% remote, distributed companies usually one two in-person meet-ups every year. Pfizer data-sharing agreement Israel. 

Part agreement Israel get lot vaccine early would stay top what's happening share data Pfizer. 

So lot info coming there, Pfizer vaccine. Moderna anything similar basically that's used country heavily tracks cases. Devastating denial vaccine. wise thing getting widely vaccinated. Nothing happiness them. apocalypse happens? illustrative uptake though whole thing started by. Look, I'd happy provide stats unable figure would give sort peace mind. think looking educated. seem set mindset nobody going convince worth wear mask longer possibly save life. Might well start mandates. Going happen anyways. Good thing democrats congress extending covid relief programs since we're fourth major wave covid.

Oh wait they're they're throw 20 million unemployed people cliff. Way represent working class. incorrect Cite? Everything I've read Japan donating AZ, produce domestically. Right, don‚Äôt owe anybody family shit, really could care less ‚Äúprotecting‚Äù strangers mask. I‚Äôm vaccinated virus scare vaccinated, stop mandating things Third dose 7-10x response second dose.

I 100% real trials. 
Arm sore 5 third hours first two. Thanks Ron DeVirus allowing antivaccers get infected! Current vaccine highly effective delta vaccine manufacturers immune this. Hospitals able bill level Government mandated it. State, federal, county, city, etc. good precedent federal government funding ""no charge point injection"" vaccine.  Maybe people change fact vaccine significantly reduces transmission. Make fun Jim bob want minority communities par per capita rural Missouri comes vax uptake. Maybe gotta accept move forward. It‚Äôs sad people die can‚Äôt punish majority minority. short turn earth. 

Take decision making back self serving politicians decide what‚Äôs right yours. wanna stay home, feds compensate you. Let rest us lives back without constant whiplash terror via money hungry corporate media. ‚òùüèª

Roid rage First poorer countries vaccinated kind immunity priori infections Given quick Delta spreads, that's going burn huge chunk population.

It considered endemic enough world's population immune either vaccinations infections virus starts running new hosts infect huge wave infections. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è appreciate writing this. opinion *way* much cynicism CDC last year+. Damn it, somebody's babies. hate this. believe Covid 19 continue mutate like Annual flu virus. get vaccinated agaist one variant, still get infected another variant. 
If unavoidable, well much do. stupid getting paid full first shot? going pay split two 2nd. Like people going line 2nd shot already paid. Like paying bunch unreliable people job finish it. hate DeBlassio stupidest crap NYer i'm affected it. mean, little half one dose. 88% adults 1 dose 66% 2. 

But anyway, someone actually lives here, tell March, May June way significant. difference staying home everything closed going family, friends, pubs restaurants minimal restrictions.

The change 'freedom day' brought option stop wearing masks people taking. 80 percent zip code weeks ago. shocking anybody vaxxed qualified point. Right POC lowest rates States. Fine, chance, recognize big hot southern black community delta variant vaccinated spreading unbeknownst you, might inconvenience you‚Ä¶. Vaccine makes ur health issues less relevant still carry virus (all strains) spread it‚Ä¶.

(I fully vaccinated, still wear mask sanitize like jesus watching every move) Wait, don‚Äôt still need masked two weeks get vaccine? I‚Äôm confused worst case scenario happens we‚Äôre waiting second generation vaccine Delta, basically starting scratch again? Shared one major Georgian city implemented mask mandate (Atlanta) doesn‚Äôt look like means others follow. Savannah mask mandate doesn‚Äôt apply private businesses.  Oh don‚Äôt socialize person lol. social media. know are, I?

Good talk. Good know actually know talking can't defend arguments. seems like people optimistic transmission rate reduction... whole family sick right now, stuff. Thought sure Covid got negative test result.  can‚Äôt assume. kinda wanted mild case Covid could get with, nope. gotta suffer sickness still worry one. Insurance companies... know actuarial data vaccine side effects know cost much lower treating COVID. insurance companies work make money. 49.8% US population fully vaccinated. I‚Äôm ‚Äútricked‚Äù names. Anti vaxers directly responsible now. came irrelevant. lucked out...that's saying true. Good thing I‚Äôm introvert **Jul. 29, 00:00 (UTC+9)**

Masters preprint medrivx study variation mutations read last week (and life able find again), showing mutations spike (which mostly concerned that‚Äôs most

Some mutations non-spike proteins give increased environmental stability. effect yet real world, don‚Äôt know. However Reddit community pretty early party last year fomite transmission virus gets around. virtually zero documented evidence middle last year. thing almost outdoors transmission time.

However Delta, several instances outdoor transmission likely.

The new variants aren‚Äôt virus. keep tabs it. Reddit threads COVID changed lot late spring-early summer 2020 lot discussion news mixed largely news aggregation source. It‚Äôs easy early signs (both good bad) get lost noise summarily dismissed.

I still consider fomite transmission highly unlikely, unless something dumb, like touch something someone else touched stick finger nose.

But may true today may necessarily true tomorrow since dealing virus changes. look hidden gems among dozens articles posted day, use common sense adaptable. folks high risk - want third shot sooner rather later.

If trying financially incentivise people right thing, fighting wrong battle. teaching better people, trying cut deals them. =/= causation give good explanation saying it‚Äôs possible receive flu shot likely take precautions comes covid. 

That explain improved clinical outcomes positive cases influenza-vaccinated versus not. Period. clearly found, don‚Äôt conclude flu vaccine protective covid. 

This clearly indicated discussion descriptive study cannot discern mechanisms, hypothetical, yet plausible immunologic mechanism could explain **apparent protective effects influenza vaccine COVID-19** process called trained immunity.

They clearly believe protective effects, clearly postulate it. ""Apparent protective effects."" even cite multiple studies hypotheses may case, including listing multiple vaccines shown cross-reactive protective effects (BCG, polio, measles).


Please demonstrate authors believe flu vaccine protective. worrying sign events like Dragoncon, Shaky Knees, ATLive. I'm really hoping cancel second year row. Seriously, woman charge CDC certifiable moron. Dont mandate anything definitely much slippery slope, liberal. would definitely problem that. However mandate State/Federal buildings require vaccines allow schools private businesses demand customers vaccinated like flu vaccine is. Vaccinated rates go up. UK far better national testing. US built capacity one point insane amount testing think fallen wayside many areas, especially south. ‚ÄúWe‚Äù. Still happy vaxxed, sure would much worse‚Ä¶. pretty damn concerning. literally wanted. 
No mask, lockdowns, vaccine, precautions know decent leader without dictator? Thankfully people like around polio we'd dealing well. It‚Äôs appalling. case numbers going instead proceeding caution we‚Äôre putting blindfold face brick gas pedal. Wow really thought something there, didn‚Äôt you? sad.  Thank you, lot people would probably love know. Good luck! Hoping give hard time. mind asking six month interval? article talking don‚Äôt anything honestly, people commented day Israel still hasn‚Äôt data peer reviewed countries have. Coming back say comment aging well. Central Okanagan reimposing mask mandate due outbreak. come‚Ä¶ Hospitalization, mortality.

2/3rds bankruptcies US include medical debt. Get vaccinated avoid hospitalization.

Almost Covid deaths US unvaccinated, get vaccinated minimize risk dying.

Seems pretty straightforward reasons get vaccinated. got first two rite aid Ohio got third Costco MI. said didn‚Äôt insurance. Bc Ohio record MI. don‚Äôt believe states share info.  Probably not.  God hate people propping breakthrough cases.

Gotta make sure ever box checked rechecked language looked solicitor's office determination comes sued. ‚ÄúOf 24 children, seven intensive care two ventilators, hospital said. half could vaccinated -- anyone 12 eligible free shot -- none hospitalized done so.‚Äù üòû  definitely cases virus evolves spread efficiently become pathogenic, rare, mostly involve switching hosts (e.g. bird flu humans).

It's much virus kills fast many chances spread killing provide evolutionary benefit. Traits provide benefit tend diminish time. 

Another way look understand mutations bad Virus (i.e. make virus viable / less effective). Via random mutations new Virus emerges effective vaccine, would reproduce spread faster, hence become dominant variant. random changes happened, everything specifically useful Virus spreading, higher chance experience random mutation makes worse better. wonder means already confident, something else. point, policy makers make determination. Breakthrough infections result serious illness death extremely rare. Mutations going happen that's threat unless get 100% world vaccinated, we'll never come close doing.

Face facts: there's growing evidence Delta variant much dangerous younger healthier people (including children) original strain. Yes, people groups often unvaxxed, unvaxxed early days pandemic well. difference filling hospitals. 

(About downvote comment: imagine care?) reason now, make mask mandate effectively saying ‚Äúwear masks forever‚Äù. was: ‚Äúwear masks find way reasonably protect ourselves‚Äù. found way. It‚Äôs perfect it‚Äôs good enough acceptable risk. breathing air, course virus levels going similar vaccinated vs unvaccinated people. virus already present air, anyone going breathe equal amount, therefore presence swabs indistinguishable. virus likely everywhere indoor settings exposure universal.

However, vaccinated people immune system respond quicker infection reduce capability replicate spread.

And second, asked?  Op made sound like vaccinated folks significant symptoms kept home, case. Everything trending upward again. Even rural areas.

Back dec/jan worst this, continued around 50 patients per day care rural hospital. vaccinations started happening, trended way 1 2 cases day. delta variant circulating, masks coming dopes going around unvaccinated, back around 20.

I‚Äôve done everything I‚Äôm supposed to. also illegal mayor's so. yet are. understand intellectually honest vaccine hesitancy point

I too, people wanted abstain keep masking social distancing I'd fine it. happy, fine.

They refused though. epitome Free Rider Problem. took guidance said vaccinated people could return normal decided pretend category. They're liars they're cheats zero respect anymore anyone know took advantage risk others took order pretend took risk given treatment. Yeah taking account today's media environment, social media makes cheap mount campaign anything. 50000/320000000 0.00016, 0.016%.

The 95% efficacy cases, vaccine studies 100% efficacy hospitalization death, number refers to. problem sub people exaggerate everything. example vaccines work Israel US, believed Covid everyone cautious declaring end pandemic, kept taking precautions like using masks, misguided fool. applauded CDC guidance told everyone thought rushed allow unmasking crowded places idiots believing science. 

When Delta arrived new surges seen countries leading vaccination like Israel, UK, narrative changed users began say vaccines working basically doomed. 

The reality positions exaggerations, pandemic pretty much changing monster need cautious it, vaccines work cannot overconfident, overpessimistic failures there. Moderation good friend situation. one anti-vaxxer Facebook. got unfriended. tolerance bullshit. Last week partner got sick something felt *very* covid-like, like thing I've ever sick resembled post-vaccine symptoms experienced (J&amp;J). showed symptoms 4 days ate fairly cramped restaurant. stomach cramps day thought we'd eaten something bad night before, evening, brief acute flu, heavy fatigue, mild chills, mild muscle aches, headache. Partner fine. went bed early, woke feeling longer properly sick, stomach still great fatigued. Saturday. fatigue hit partner day, too, Sunday super fatigued, anything lay around. Monday started feeling better; took day get caught things weekend. Tuesday, feel like mild covid-brain; keep getting headaches peak late afternoon/early evening, mild case dumbs. Wednesday, same, fatigue almost completely gone.

My main recommendation: Buy easy meals ready go Sunday, kinds things keep fridge cook microwave. show symptoms like had, eating biggest challenge, unprepared like were, wind spending ton Doordash deliveries.

By way, took test Saturday tested negative. We're buying that; covid. 10-15 years sickened this! Aw, that's tough. awful position parents. brother's offer kind. least options. Take care internet stranger.

If course I'll keep wearing mask, taking vaccine recommended, stay home I'm sick. dammit.... getting old. works extremely well preventing serious illness death. works bit less well thought preventing infection transmission virus.

Cmon Malaka. eventual endgame endemic covid similar endemic flu. It'll virus get vaccinated every year about‚Ä¶no? offer covid - mutate milder form accept dodge vaccines


Covid ... hmm ok vaccinated done point. governments mandate idiots vaccinations least masks again, world powers prioritize providing vaccinations areas ripe variants. we're large enough majority herd immunity, we're certainly large enough majority masks anything unvaccinated go maskless. aggregate, delta? Jeez I'm sorry :( hope well. 850 deaths 6 months drop bucket total number people vaccinated CDC @ 16 per day 7 day average (112 deaths past 7 days)

Not bad considering FL ya beat: 34 daily average (404 past 7 days) rise 92 reported new. Yes, once, issue employers employees come better vaccines. 

Even broken clock vaccinated.. something. üòâ Depends live. Many Governors (including Colorado) reluctant move forward additional mandates. Nobody wearing mask anymore - public keen returning them. staying alive incentive enough. read mind. well-off world's standards people search something get upset about. incredibly lucky access vaccines makes sad know friends south central America would give anything family able get vaccine. mean, there's reason rules, regulations, processes right? think efficacy higher lot lower lot people believe. surely 90's like feel said news. know almost dozen people tested positive fully vaccinated. sure know like 800 people. Okay. hear you. since crazy amounts vaccinated people getting infected infecting others, even vaccinated people, really doesn‚Äôt solve problem. understanding need get tested come contact (ie around someone least 15 minutes) confirmed positive COVID test. generally means someone tells you, like family member, friend, coworker (although states/countries notification systems well). I‚Äôm USA never got covid, got vaccine Jan 2021. made deathly ill 36 hours. I‚Äôm healthcare worker contemplated ER numerous time.

I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm vaccinated, I‚Äôd lying said don‚Äôt hesitations booster shot. Legal coercion absolutely anti-liberty. real question whether infringement liberty justified.

I get flu shot every year. Two years ago flu pregnant. bad. Horrible. stayed home quarantined. weren‚Äôt mandated wear masks flu season. Hell, RSV highly contagious serious illness kids. never required wear masks, even outbreak. 

I masks. I‚Äôm vaccinated. Don‚Äôt tell need wear mask don‚Äôt want to. recent study talking 1/5 asymptomatic people develop long covid. Actually research say something makes sense.

That's theme since started. overwhelming majority people nothing worry about. still need look cases, especially infection rates. That's care 7 14 day moving averages daily case counts science policy standpoint.

That shows trends whether virus contained. Blips happen pandemic eventually ends. want trendiest plunging towards zero. delta spread time everywhere dropped mask distance mandates vaccine rates plummeted.

If kept vaccine rates kept makes till probably even now, would probably avoided. ""Moron"" here. never get shot. death rate 20% could understand mandatory vaccines death rate percent can't believe many ACTUAL morons cannot see would odd thing make mandatory. suppose people absolutely need government tell live completely lost ;) 163 million people US fully vaccinated Whether specifics covid relative smallpox would allow similar legal reasoning used circumstances clear

Yeah saw couple comments mentioning that. Delta variant contagious smallpox (similar R0), smallpox case fatality ~30% compared less 1% covid. would get tried court would depend heavily judge hears trial kind mood they're day lol.

Let‚Äôs pretend roles aren‚Äôt reversed cases. cares long people get vaccine agree thought thing last Fall Winter. 

It basically went like this... schools re-open, slight uptick. think ever accounted much spread begin areas high mask compliance/remote schooling options, etc. Halloween happened... election... Thanksgiving... Xmas/NYE, etc., throughout events #'s went combination less mixing others indoors/unmasked, high levels caution, vaccines brought positive cases dramatically everyone felt little comfortable again. 

Also, number unvaccinated world high we'll ups downs believe. They'll probably get smaller, they're gonna fact life many, many people fully vaccinated get boosters. Conservative Party's achievement pandemic vaccine procurement. stupid enough speak them. world cannot take USA athletes they‚Äôre using back handed techniques knock competition.

This surge way get vaccination numbers up.

Back away put keyboard sir Good business. want vaccine want health insurance policy. fails account age-specific differences vaccination rates well acquired immunity among 140m population. Yeah, mean us still paying attention saw happened India, isn‚Äôt surprising. 
I‚Äôm already creating contingency plans based cases trend immediate community. Tranmission mechanism: 

 meet schedule used identify potential transmission settings, including gymnastics facilities. 
 Four Oklahoma patients outbreak-associated COVID-19 attended two out-of-state regional gymnastics meets (April 15‚Äì18 April 23‚Äì26) infectious period (Figure). OSDH ADS staff members used publicly available third-party websites listing gymnastics meet results identify potential exposures cases within Oklahoma. That's still true, far I've seen. new information significant portion hospitalizations deaths may ultimately caused transmission vaccinated person patient, think likely recently. Agree. Unvaccinated driving spread. vaccinated.

So make argument we're better ignoring rare cases vaccinated people transmitting slow us getting people vaccinated.  hope top medals table 1 silver lining least. experimental antiviral called 'DRACO' protect pretty much viruses. 
 
How works instead producing virus specific antibodies attack virus may protect viruses - instead 'DRACO' substance waits body - within bodies cells perhaps - virus infects cell DRACO hijacks virus soon enters cell rewires part virus destroy said infected cell. Virus infects cell, injects virus code cell - DRACO attaches self destruct code onto virus infection code - cell reads virus code see's self destruct code cell thus self destructs. substance designed specifically detect whether infection happens. 
 
So means like substance probably protect flu virus, COVID 19.. Common cold.. Etc.. 
 
Though substance maybe antiviral actual vaccine - still could last maybe actually make DRACO actual vaccine somehow getting body produce DRACO itself. 
 
Here news article it: 
 90 Survival rate mean virus leaves body undamaged. 
The virus causing permanent damage body - stuff like brain damage, lung scarring - make lungs like smoker lungs. 
And furthermore get infected - maybe later bodies antibodies wear vaccine wears get reinfected - maybe infected mutated variant meaning body gets even permanent damage dealt body. reinfection making body worse time - maybe lowering survival rate time maybe exponentially. agree also said. said, handedly, possibility response question sound concerned moved quickly. 

It response loaded question media ran people misconstrued without context. possibility means nothing vaccines shedding viruses, Would illness you‚Äôve past still shedding? US needs same. end game mass vaccination/herd immunity years away, decade+. Covid &amp; mutations &amp; surges around long time. need come realization vaccines prophylactic, like flu shots. mass vaccination flu campaigns unrealistic ever cover 70% populace. covid.

Is new research suggests Pfizer better Moderna? u ""kids get sick"" shtick played one year. No, widely known, and, even worse, widely believed. 

Politics + idiocy created antivax monster. article manages even sway one idiot vaccinate, I'd give kudos, instead making everything worse auto-downplaying. logical wear masks (N95) indoors - 1m distance almost useless indoors. less sense wear outside full sun too. local school district fence requiring masks. governor said masks essential unvaccinated yet refuses order masks schools. I'm worried. far petition online that's getting signatures local Parents Liberty started anti masking petition district kid probably school year. I'm devastated school board let vocal minority set health policy. Yet business manager still Thinks it‚Äôs democratic hoax. Fml Location/Demographics:

As May 27, 2021, 
 
 47 COVID-19 cases associated facility identified among 23 gymnasts, three staff members, 21 household contacts.
 Outbreak identified B.1.617.2 variants.
 median patient age 14 years (range = 5‚Äì58 years) (Table 1).
 Among 47 cases, two adult patients hospitalized (both unvaccinated epidemiologically linked); one required intensive care. whittled basically shell proposed passed vote go debate. Nothing passed yet.  
What know absolutely true: non-vaccinated people causing spiking numbers. vaccinated people ""rare"" situations ""sometimes"" spreading it. need get vaccination rates WAY stop Delta. giving people fence another reason get vaccination...because RARE corner case, going backwards. this, argue get higher vaccination rates quicker ignoring corner cases. 
 
We need stay focused matters...vaccination rates...and nothing hinder us getting goal. Stockholders rejoice. Thanks! too!! Also - 


Well kids going online Sept. talking about? CDC's latest statements make clear vaccinated unvaccinated people spreading Delta variant. Israel, 77+% vaccination rate, proves this. variant spreading like wildfire there.  
 
Thank God morbid predisposition inflict pain scapegoat others drive public health policy. Pulled article Wall Street Journal:

Your right, Israel breakthrough hospitalizations. there's two reasons that. 

1. MUCH higher percentage population Israel fully vaccinated, caseload low considered practically insignificant. (200 people per day) yeah less people taking hospital beds, room hospital, means people may need hospitalized getting hospitalized. 

Even cases, Israel optimistic: quote wall street journal interview:

""These so-called breakthrough cases‚Äîdefined positive Covid-19 test results received least two weeks patients receive final vaccine dose‚Äîare broadly expected Pfizer vaccine highly effective 100% foolproof, according Mr. Balicer.

Israeli health officials optimistic even variant spread, evidence countries U.K. indicate vaccine prevent large increase severe illness hospitalizations plagued country‚Äôs health system previous outbreaks. Israel recorded five severe cases past 10 days, Prof. Balicer said, whether emerge early tell.""

Also article Israel21c:

""While early July report found vaccine 93% effective preventing serious illness Covid-19, number dropped 91% late July report. Furthermore, ministry observed healthy vaccinated individuals least one-third lower chance developing severe Covid-19 healthy unvaccinated individuals.""

That's still better nothing. get wrong, that's perfect that's still really good. 

Also stopping disease end pandemic. never was. goal prevent hospitals getting overrun, still operate people stroke, hear attack, cancer, etc.

Hospitals report 99% people coming covid unvaccinated taking beds away people may need them. ones prolonging pandemic. (That's statistic thrown around weeks now) 

So yeah, breakthrough infections data in. Vaccines way better not, best thing everyone get vaccinated. may perfect hell lot better Kirk suggesting. data backs up. Including data countries great article Forbes better explaining still think kind mandate would end court (possibly supreme court).

You count it! Although case cited precedent mask mandates challenge successful far know.

And correct cannot dragged house forcibly injected. wonder limits fine/state action could be. Could state take state-issued drivers license example? ban Facebook? think that‚Äôs fair. original quote post based people certain ideology though, hence ‚Äúthey‚Äù.

Full approval brings ability order service members get vaccine. help some. Seems care idiosyncrasies Coronavirus rather including virus IE Rabies, HIV, etc course they've bumbled. fluid situation like this, acting best information time, going make lot mistakes along way. key thing people ignoring, though, they've corrected mistakes they've found them, best can. course, CDC Fauci 100% consistent, never changing anything day 1, things would much worse people would complaining that.

Weird. guy everything could get people vaccinated, sabotaged bunch conservatives conservative states swallowed contagious variant vaccines effective against, that's ... fault? answering  death reporting delayed. I'm sure Worldometers sourcing MO death data, state dashboard says ""Note: Deaths often reported significant delay. encourage look death data past several weeks understand trends. view available Statewide County dashboards.""

FWIW, St Louis Pandemic Task Force reporting 7 day average four deaths day based records within health systems (unfortunately, graphs Facebook). Springfield reports [deaths June. referring people developing psychological disorders / mental health issues pandemic living stressful traumatic period (+ sensationalist media), direct result catching covid follow July 19th end restrictions?

* every 102k VACCINATED 100 symptomatic breakthroughs (not even hospitalized) ONE death. Ah okay, would make sense.

Still, projections peak it'll start moving downward quickly. seems like wave going burn fast. Everyone loved Israeli data wasn‚Äôt positive anymore. get that. sarcastic.

When know issue want unconvinced wearing mask, also helps ages, kids. tax attorney, brilliant idea, ashamed think it. Gets around sorts constitutional issues.

Of course, hope Covid goes away, point, seems endemic. forcing birth control poor populations can't afford children

Boy, got news BIA... data cases looks like southern states blow away winter numbers, yeah people extremely concerned. Reckon going see supply chain disruptions next month vaccine hold outs slowly start get vaccinated slow 3rd wave. Mandatory school vaccinations already exist. get MMR vaccine. Covid literally different. keeps up, I'm going switch back remote instructions upcoming school year.
Yeah may paranoid, worth risking child's life missed important part course, people I've talked seem opinion 1 million risk less acceptable 2 100 risk (their numbers words, mine)

Those people deserve ridicule belittlement. policy go effect September 7, month away. Infants age 5: data estimated ready present FDA sometime late fall (Oct/Nov).

If need masks, state emergency, local governments impose mandate. vaccines.

It's times like make realise backward civilisation.  problem fact we're highly vaccinated nation, letting Delta run rampant among vaccinated creates vaccine defeating variants, however mild cases may be. agree CDC guidance could additional qualifier hospitalization rate. 

Though caution hospitalization positivity rate grow fairly quickly. Texas, 7-day average new cases per day grew 1.3k (lower cases/100k New Jersey right now) 10k 3 weeks, hospitalization 1500 5000 time span, positivity rate went 3% 6 weeks ago 15% now. 

New Jersey higher vaccination rates. Though even percentage vaccination may protect surge. example, Houston's suburb Fort Bend county, 66% 12+ fully vaccinated 76% least one dose. still 'high' transmission 12.5% positivity rate. 

New hospital admission increased 115%, beds used COvid increased 5.6% 9.4%, ICU bed used Covid grew 10% 20% last 7 days. 

So higher transmissiability Delta, 66% 76% full partial vaccination enough prevent outbreak. think that‚Äôs majority issue. However, still big deal everyone. I‚Äôm going vacation couple weeks. Normally, get sick, deal it. test positive Covid, even super mild, you‚Äôre morally forced quarantine 10 days.

Surely *something* done point. Haha yup, whatever mental gymnastics need order get board rest us fine me. Hi. Please get vaccines.
Mum vaccinated firmly believe one reasons one got her. Well, that's fault. specified USA. Ain't way USA getting 80%. matter many eligible here...still happening unless major change.

But good Canada. Nice work there. figure help us better, please do. policy go effect September 7. ""We requiring guests show proof fully vaccinated,"" pop-up notice website said, adding, ""Our teams required fully vaccinated well."" Ha. need shot young fit. point extremely unlikely young fit person die it. using comparison yardstick. Yeah. vaccinated people, pretty much aside small group immunocompromised old frail, suffer significant consequences Covid infection manage catch all. affected sure. virus circulates mutate may impact efficacy vaccines.

Plus get sick, they'll going hospital, taking resources could gone people needed them. Louisiana, Missouri, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Florida, Tennessee.

You‚Äôre right. wasn‚Äôt aware LA moved Alabama. know, maybe could see logic smallpox vax, transmit cowpox (the agent used vaccine) injection site soiled bandages, etc., touched. Covid vaccine contain part virus. ex-wife hide parents. However six-year-old knew vaccines, know blurted out! Way go kid! [This page gives many examples real-world Aren''t ""Personal Freedoms!""? 

They sure stick nose everyone's business Honestly looks like that's already starting happen extent. They're important tool box outbreaks, especially become seasonal. east Asian idea masking cold flu season always good one would great west followed suit. Even entirely voluntary basis people feel symptoms. kind hyperbole misinformation counter productive. million recorded cases population 300 million US. become mentally handicapped.  Check Netherlands really want steep. Well done. lol Covid something feel zero tolerance acceptable. Also good CCP something unlike politicians. link goes depth bunch studies existed start Cases concentrated low-vaccination areas, know CDC paying attention they've recommended masks areas high case counts. Immunity vaccinated means plenty keeps case counts low enough prevent local rise case counts. far, that's happening lot country. sometimes deaths day crime Covid last month‚Ä¶ Whatever, won‚Äôt get incompetence further. kicked ass two days, twice, that's honestly amazing outcome relative huge number people Oh no, pandemic style precautions pandemic?

Painfully obvious obscure ignorant  Learn read contextual clues misguided koala. Doubtful. Personally know ~20 people it. confirmed joke. dont understand isnt better tax incentive make Canadian products.

Put taxes foreign reduce taxes Canadian goods bought Canada.

If customer either pays tax foreign less local. asking legitimate honest question? genuinely looking information, genuinely trying discussion, requires banned?  Thsts over! move past done. I've one restaurants (Gramercy Tavern) decidedly upscale. Even ""casual"" side business casual vibe. recall seeing kids eating there. Vaccines plan. Half country stupid get them, are. people went mask mask of....shedding. Hey whatever works. 100% agree. happy came common ground clarified. speaking children schools vaccinations available. think masking schools stay approval given younger children. Oh okay thanks, makes sense. Sure level makes think decision get vaccine makes look stupid family member get it.  basically told so. worst thing people get. Even greater death required go restaurant, gym, airplane, cruise, grocery store, barber, salon, walmart, costco, concert. None RIGHTS requirements live. luxuries. literally live home without required visit things EVER, based logic. Hell, right WORK even guaranteed many states (if all).

So ""not requirement"" bar, things limits health emergency personal decisions impact others/ situations obese person, example,sure could make better choices burden long run hopsitals correct it, experience Costco unaffected person's choice obese. Someone walking unvaxxed super contagious could seriously fuck people interact within days. think mixing COVID body vs vaccine. COVID causes brain damage / psychological damage.

Also stuff like Pfizer vaccine definitely cause that.

&amp;#x200B;

**I also want show something lose hope dealing mutations such:**

There experimental antiviral called 'DRACO' protect pretty much viruses.

 
How works instead producing virus specific antibodies attack virus may protect viruses - instead 'DRACO' substance waits body - within bodies cells perhaps - virus infects cell DRACO hijacks virus soon enters cell rewires part virus destroy said infected cell. Virus infects cell, injects virus code cell - DRACO attaches self destruct code onto virus infection code - cell reads virus code see's self destruct code cell thus self destructs. substance designed specifically detect whether infection happens.

 
So means like substance probably protect flu virus, COVID 19.. Common cold.. Etc..

 
Though substance maybe antiviral actual vaccine - still could last maybe actually make DRACO actual vaccine somehow getting body produce DRACO itself.

 
Here news article it:  
Also 90 Survival rate mean virus leaves body undamaged. 
The virus causing permanent damage body - stuff like brain damage, lung scarring - make lungs like smoker lungs.

 
And furthermore get infected - maybe later bodies antibodies wear vaccine wears get reinfected - maybe infected mutated variant meaning body gets even permanent damage dealt body. reinfection making body worse time - maybe lowering survival rate time maybe exponentially.

 
But right vaccine would keep safe meantime - Pfizer vaccine example already year safe enough. Prevent body getting worse worse now. maybe later get 'all purpose' vaccine later target maybe viruses.. Exactly. Wear mask stay indoors vaccines, logical. Wear masks stay indoors hospitals overwhelmed, logical. Get vaccinated, wear mask, otherwise whatever want until... what.. forever, next month, public sentiment calms down, hospital Arkansas longer close capacity.. exactly why? article feel blown proportion? 

Deaths low right generally lag 30 days. time someone tested positive hospitalized they'll hospital 2-3 weeks passing away. time reported close week areas.

The concerning thing despite lower average age COVID patient, mortality rate decreased comparing 7 day average deaths compared 7 day average cases 30 days ago.

I'm data analyst I've tracking data since first wave. course mortality rate may lower people getting tested, there's information suggest people getting tested they've contact someone COVID. I'm supposed go see Korn 8th. Bought tickets delta went nuts, seriously considering selling tickets eating cost.... Yeeeeah no. office honor system people walk around masks leaving desk. back normal figured vaccine Kirk‚Äôs forehead? get point majority vaccinated could well less transmissible breachy virus takes hold. Whatever allows transmitted better given circumstances. Die get tested? hard right media, religion huge hand hear there. That‚Äôs wish original CDC guidelines stuck. Kids aren‚Äôt vaccinated wear masks. Totally fair. vaccinated people wear them?? pandemic unvaccinated. risk spread vaccine person low it‚Äôs clear CDC caved political pressure start masking again. point fuck let'em die... allow insurances refuse cover cost unvaccinated people need masks mandatory vaccination. 

The sheer number people, refusing get vaccinated, heard somewhere somebody symptoms, ridiculous. grant that, however, assuming OP young healthy, chances severe disease low, vaccinated unvaccinated. Chances developing long Covid, original article discusses, vaccinated vs unvaccinated appalling work 98% cases unvaccinated? Pretty sure virus transmit it. fucking delta variant, everything going well. ""Out nowhere""

OK, good points, absolutely nowhere... US hitting low 9k cases per day month ago. We're 80k day now. So, nuanced discussion exactly *should* doing, trying imply nowhere incredibly disingenuous.  say last year time? say people reacting talked vaccine passports year ago? stage, think anyone overreacting we're 16 months world turned head everyone blaming neighbor unsure things leading experts world unsure well. Cbc.ca daily updates numbers going gradually whereas trend cases reversed dramatically week. That's makes suspicious immunity. What?

If anything, CDC pushing *against* public pressure saying this. I'm pretty sure they're afraid government restrictions &amp; sanctions actual virus.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* seems somewhat common there.

It's not. Antivaxxers feel like they're majority they're likely report such, fact small, vocal annoying find summary vaccination data various breakdowns. Unfortunately italian reasonably clear. \~95% available doses expended, vaccination campaign still going top speed 550K doses/day.

Enjoy suffering. That's exactly concern, give inch they'll take mile. Rolling preventative care incentives good idea. least, force people talk explain PCP getting vaccinated. Treasury Department said Thursday money pay vaccine incentive payments could come $350 billion relief funds given states cities part economic rescue package Congress approved March. incentive intended ‚Äúboost vaccination rates, protect communities, save administration also stepping efforts get companies give employees time get Treasury Department Internal Revenue Service said employers claim tax credits cover wages paid workers take family members get vaccinated care members households recovering vaccination. Self-employed workers also eligible receive tax credits. vaccine provides strong protection hospitalization death deadly virus, minimal side effects, cost vast fortunes develop produce, free individuals. provide sufficient value, fail understand $100 make difference. Still, gets us past this, worth doing. fails, try opposite approach, announcing date vaccines longer free individuals. Then, maybe people might see value them.   can‚Äôt stand three word slogans. want deeply distrust something put slogan form.

If exposure delta covid 19 symptoms, risk transmitting delta 6 people office. Even vaccinated, might still break infection virus 6 opportunities mutate. go home spouses kids, go work, ect ect. Even stay asymptomatic, probably want much chance mutation. Well, yes. course were. Developing safe effective vaccine quickly pipe dream throughout 2020.

I understand objection.  Yea ‚Äî cases people getting sick insurance going back find totally unrelated reason deny coverage. Particularly boosters recommended future don‚Äôt want insurance companies able see ‚Äúoops you‚Äôre late covid booster we‚Äôre covering cancer treatment. Sorry.‚Äù Also convinced abstract risk bankruptcy indeterminate future good way get people vaccinated now. offer incentives vaccination like getting regular preventative care screenings now. Sorry quarantining past year half paying pocket get tested. vaccinated individual worn masks whenever told truly problem"
