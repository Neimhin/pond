0,2020-08-29," theaters. need go better movie theaters. Damn, $10k per year tuition seemed really high looked costs states. Sadly, it’s far off. That's weird. Everyone r/teacher leaving public schools expect face face classes unsafe conditions. Teachers surrounded staff wear masks distance. Public schools alright sending disadvantaged students IEPs 504s building remote learning place building able run safely time (1/3 students.).
 handed resignation today (Saturday). DESE even trying hide agenda early August guide opening schools ""3ft distance desks"" tip iceberg. 
 I'm surprised online teaching, though say DESE notified school they'd tough us opening remote first believe hybrid full... Yup, DESE says districts make decisions, DESE going cite shit school.

I'm glad I'm able leave I'm glad could get another job midst pandemic. that's called contract brewing, pretty common. make five gallon homebrew batches dial recipe consult someone changed brew volume. think big difference hop utilization. must liked feedback leaked week ago 9000 kids diagnosed first two weeks school. don't, care much kids teach.

It's that. many states, strike, lose teaching license life. even strike successfully spurred changes, bad, legally allowed teach anymore. Hmm... definitely concern worth taking consideration guess. Watch video free moment. pretty much covers talking (including possibility low success rates): pessimistic really, honest, incredible many vaccine candidates. hate point one sole cause, issue Facebook. perfect vector spreading misinformation people believe everything read there. think there’s much distrust media right people much willing believe meme posted third cousin saying masks don’t work. say virus numbers “confidential” entire state Petri dish. Good numbers would billboards. going get better? Many jobs gone good. 
Many people losing homes good.
Many people going long term health complications Covid problems. 

Optimism many non existence.. good mix local (2hr diameter) Philly Metro/NJ. cheaper state go in-state NJ. college churned solid people. know quite really well broadcasting world making bank. Disallows enforcing mask states straight revoke teacher’s license strike. Problem assholes never seem get it, somehow spread educated innocent people. brother? Idk. He's going get tested. He's probably going continue life has. wife getting tested Monday 8am. SIL got daughter outbreak college housing unit. Daughter mostly asymptomatic several symptoms fine. symptoms far. he's definitely never going miss day work. willing go sit answer phone see customers behind glass window do. Whoever raised damn good parent. would proud young child mature understanding. go better movie theaters. well, pandemic passes. makes difference. fiancé also masters computer science KU he’s literally smartest person know working amazing company making lot money. Don’t listen people want shit state schools. Scary! need milk! Yeah I’ve addressed comments I’m this. Enjoy night! course is. information Polish; mention ‘confidential report’ language article, including English, supposed originated from.. It’s party school. say that, say knowing full well literally every college “a party school,” Kutztown worse. really bunch idiots whose goal get drunk nothing lives. Hilarious, even professors fucking morons America. something water taking tablets make stupid what? Oh one too. Lol it’s kind insane. Still harm seeing methods could apply India. would lie, deception would *celebrated* many. numbers good would confidential. Keep general rule thumb. Wait, vaccine recodes RNA produce vaccine itself? Oh boy.

Forecast today clear warm slight chance zombies. older relative mine goes every year last four years. waits doctor let wait longer get flu shot. heart issues usually doctor insists comes late September. always says he's frustrated two three weeks later news comes announces strain inoculated one going around year. :/

Yes, tell still gives bit protection anyways. virus natural reservoirs therefore could lockdown long like make go away. likely positive tests high Ct value non-infectious simple arithmetic. average person Ct value 33-40 short period time way up, long period time way clearing infection.  33-40 1 2 days way 33-40 15-40 days way down, it’s much likely you’re picking people tail end. 

 Teachers paid summer months unless pick summer school classes. choose districts pay 9 months classes paid overr 12-month period, actually earned 9 months classes. summers vacations. would imply paid time off. cuz knew someone like thought hoax let within 50 feet grandfather died, told mom generation family first get shot space it’ll probably cheaper option then. prisons. Basically, anyone unable speak themselves. We're boned indications AASI genes worse covid outcomes. South Indians worse off. compare north India Pakistan . testing Pakistan much worse off. may case reached herd immunity already. FOX News claiming schools indoctrinating kids years. Pushing homeschooling, getting teach kids family Christian values.


This summer flip flopped like fish water.  Florida would kept tests. Yeah this. 

These people found long present day isolationists  folk literally global conspiracy rail globalization, realizing irony saying doing. Yeah, guess comes capacity getting rid covid19. like Spanish flu it'll around forever form another. 0% chance ventilation sewage systems get checked way need be.

It's one failure part Trump administration n95s employees. ridiculous thing say. really wish Florida Man would get back stupid shit like riding gators like water-skis nude least death humerous. live rural basically 25% mask usage. last 4-5 months really shined large spot society me.

That's wild. Masks easy! monorail one party per compartment. ferry also option you’d prefer something open air. 

Honestly, worst part indoor dining. Indoor queues plexiglass barriers, distance parties, reduced capacity reduced wait times anyway. 

Still comfortable going, longer think it’s completely reckless. Oh yikes. Thank you! Yes. guy talking ass.   estimates efficacy error bars sorts; COVID-19 vaccine, FDA wants 95% confidence efficacy lower 30%. The Solidarity Vaccines Trials Expert Group of World Health Organization (WHO) argued editorial published in The Lancet yesterday 
 weakly effective vaccine could actually worsen pandemic  
it induced authorities relax control measures, mask wearing,  
or vaccinated people believed immune increased  
risk-taking behavior.

And there's problem. 30% effective vaccine fixes little beside political points election. Many many still suffer. think weeks carrying ""there's suspicious number conspiracy theorists... Russia must behind it!""  people live India USA, Europe Brazil combined. I'm sure getting herd anytime soon. Windows open.... that's fire hazard. Report it. building caught fire door exit room, things could go badly something blocked door outside. Yep. program amazing. almost went chose go Tyler Temple. I’m 100% agreement big problem, article first week July? last week plenty relevant information coming Iowa. China can’t even put clean baby formula. I’d take vaccine approval giant truckload salt. absolutely true everyone there. fiancé masters software engineering smartest person know currently making 6 figure salary one best companies area. 

What ignorant statement make n *Did know Jim. Rip Yeah resign prick honestly thought US dumb fucks. Sorry U.K. noted Pakistan better, countries lot similarities. India copy Pakistan doing, hell sure could ask blueprint adapt situation. bit googling indicates serious side effects vaccines rare, like 1 10,000 patients 1 100,000 patients. deaths far rare. 

For people one high risk covid groups, death rate 8-20%, permanent crippling damage (heart, lungs) 20-78% (depends studies read) guaranteed, taking vaccine effective 1 10,000 chance serious damage damned good bargain. American thank people helping feel alone large swath fools amidst us. almost gave tear, imagine pain ,being born able see mother Republicans want know bad fucked up. indications IFR less 0.1%. far overrun hospital beds empty . Excess deaths delhi mumbai ( places reliable data ) negative territory. can't admit wrong. would rather go ship. Don’t forget people Taiwan Korea countries usually complaint US. Even children, Taiwan back 2002 SARS, wore masks school. Plus Taiwan Korea way higher density US. Sarcasm. previous articles saying drug proven work, lot people took good news. Australia too. extent around. expect full recovery, that's illogical, recession crashed economy self inflicted therefore recovery could quicker depending likely reopen economy completely, said there's still tens millions remain unemployed foreseeable future. need right approach ensuring safety also recovering many jobs possible, seems almost impossible right now. I'm already preparing mentally tax increases we're going face UK We're seeing resurgence people mask around strangers, people know - can't get virus someone know. It’s scary much you’re downvoted. Shut up. probably 500,000 American deaths December. 5 million next year. Kazakstan number one exporter goats world! another storage distribution conditions
at -20° Celsius/-4° Fahrenheit **point of
care temperature normal refrigerated
conditions (2-8° Celsius/36-46° Fahrenheit)**

It might feel great, awful. Also Internet helped find nutcases share ideas organize. 10k idiotic morons brain ,come crowd protest ""fAkE"" ,so like saying wearing spacesuit space useless dying outside space real Sooo tell people get early die following advice. professor? would love read in-depth writing big picture spread virus since started, global perspective you’ve laid out. take step back it’s quite fascinating Covid aside, teaching seems like could pretty fun! make art video games, mostly 3d mostly characters, I’ll jump concepts 2d art need to. Pandemics concerning. Even certain age. 2001 12+ instead hospitalized chickenpox last week 11. We'd literally already scheduled vaccination woke spots. 

Thankfully severity chickenpox, given waiver received shingles vaccine 21. finally redemption could killing aged infirm relatives perfectly mask abiding.  Jeez, really trying argument guy. would point saying ""even 85% effective better nothing"", statement would make sense. Obviously effectiveness vaccine good, results good group. He's saying even effectiveness vaccine good might be, could be, likely be, still good results group.

It's hypothetical, pessimistic. I’ve read horror stories here. Particularly people work cable companies. Stay safe. Father survived 1918 flu pandemic, son survived COVID-19. Two different people. spouse also get it? Suppression constitution great way friends get rich. Sometimes think need rework whole goverment... doesnt matter going break rules anyways. talk people.

I genuinely understand many fucking imbeciles Thank everything do, wish nothing health happiness think understand concept transmission novel respiratory virus consistently reported deadly elderly patients patients age group pre existing conditions like obesity, diabetes etc. Young people immune effect virus, many left permanent lung damage, mention act asymptomatic carriers spread old people. suggest research typing bunch bullshit internet. Ah, UK got vaccine produced Belgian pharmaceutical company Janssen US biotech company Novavax need Astra Zeneca? Wonder vaccines work end? forgot /s  Trump getting jealous. Yep
Even discussing work stoppage actionable - unions toothless. huge shame evolution humans stopped Thanks sanity check, taking beating thread earlier lmao mark they're they're making cold calls ex teachers? sign strength rather weakness, I'd think. Okay ........ yes Idk helps you, I’ve putting kids breakout rooms majority class period.

Basic structure:
- warmup type answer chat, randomly selected kid reads one answers. Students open daily assignment time. 

- discuss give &lt;10 minutes notes/instructions.

- put breakout rooms group roles (have day introduce - kids like them) - facilitator (leads discussion makes sure one gets left behind), notetaker (shares screen makes sure everyone question time), Reporter (shares group talked end makes sure everyone understands), Timekeeper (keeps track time reminds group stay task). 

- kids breakout rooms (i would put 6 room class size 60) cycle rooms observe, remind group roles, answer questions.

- end class, reporters share, go assignment, make exit ticket google forms chat. Check post history! RockStar looooves telling people undiagnosed mental health issues. Self proclaimed “arm-chair psychologist” sounds like almost problems software related tbh.

Stop using whatever absolute garbage gave use whatever works. keep using what's working, guess that's option.

Not able mute class lecture... like wtf even that!? little ""raised hand"" icons obvious classroom simulation? absolute cluster-fuck program on? 

I really think main issue terrible software needs called changed asap. like group thinks black people can't get it. still understand logic behind probably none. Point 1: actually. Check performance gaps wealthy districts poor districts. check teacher evaluation reports districts.

Point 2: kids succeed regardless. many don't, ones can't need good teachers.

Point 3: did, states started making strikes illegal, put teachers one year contracts teacher got influential tattered remains left unions could non-renewed (despite tenure). mention, teachers strike bunch clocks made. people sometimes young even understand going forced suffer. Read as: totally control Turns estimate short 8k quick google search. Dang 2020 worst. Parents fuss things great, they're gonna fuss things terrible. net change.

Teachers gonna underpaid overworked things great they're gonna underpaid overworked things terrible. net change.

Kids going succeed fail based teacher upon society environment they're brought in. family supportive present, going struggle. net change.

It'll different flavor year nothing actually change. need stress. Maybe lied Florida Department Health claims number COVID-19 cases schools ~~confidential~~ *damning*.

Fixed.

If low number suggested competence, they'd problem saying it. States release aggregate statistics time kinds student academic health figures. 

Florida also strongest open public records ""sunshine"" laws, (part many ""Florida Man"" cases show media) absolutely contrary spirit laws, area really could inform public behavior public policy--which hidden. article linked hospitalizations occurred April 2020 conclusively linked e-cigs patients tested negative multiple PCR tests SARS-CoV-2.

They distinct conditions lead pneumonia ARDS (which lungs conditions around long time COVID). remember title study? I've always wondered severity symptoms vary much... Fuck government administration trying throw bus. understand anyone teach children teachers quarantined, gotten sick, died, quit? Depends ""they"" mean  particularly lusty one? enjoy whining pointlessly reddit. authorities opposite everything, cases lower complete lockdown strict rules cases per day highest curve going soon unlocking everything courts saying life stopped covid. Tf logic that?? better map would map deaths counts average death count country. us undercounting covid-19 deaths 50% nationally. \~0.7% would happen matter little diversity country has. race, class, religion, case US, political alignment. personal device personal data plan (schools don’t often allow outside devices onto WiFi!) Fellow music teacher, specifically HS orchestra, completely feel you. understand virtual learning 100% everyone's good, accelerate quickly safely return live classes.

But same. 100% lagless internet VR technology enable performing others real time exists, teachers students access it, truly viable virtual replacement large ensemble performance, IMO.

Only 2nd year, definitely working harder ever trying somehow make class still engaging balancing students' varied needs situations. great physical mental health, doubt good their's either.

Seriously reconsidering continue this, even things return non-pandemic situations, pursue alternate career.  suppose weather confidential soon long cases anywhere cases transferred anywhere else. cannot beaten declared victory over. Life finds way. Bout fast could without drifting rock instead pavement. true spread surfaces. might say there's zero evidence aerosolized transmission, there's TONS circumstantial evidence. actually even circumstantial evidence transmission via surfaces. Look Linsey Marr, forefront getting fucking nimrods recognize spread mostly aerosols also constantly pointing many science, especially U.S., keep moving goal posts citing zero evidence things claim true... like surface transmission... cause isnt any. famous contact traced outbreak studies, say cases could caused surfaces giant stretch. evidence pointed, day one, carried aerosols via air currents almost entirely indoors.

Asymptomatic spread MIGHT another, looked enough studies done outside U.S. seem listen ears look eyes using brain assessing risk. vaping, lot cases pneumonia among stars public last year. whoopi golberg, oprah, savannah guthrie, elton john, etc. pneumonia. pneumonia outbreak north carolina blamed hot tub display fair another incident atlanta.

Thank helping us keep information /r/Coronavirus reliable!


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* exactly expected then? 

You're trying say ""*that's works*"" instead saying *""that's used work online teaching needed stop people dying.""*

I understand I'm saying seems unpalatable harsh. saying rely assumption pass - telling need learn fail. keep going.

Another advantage use online education students truly go speed (specially recording lectures). let fail. take whatever speed manage. even opporitunities catch standard maybe-available remedial classes face-to-face.

You let fail know fail its' going shift students parents realizing responsibility this.

It's higher education already anyway. think handle kid-friendly version. fault. people actually infected mutated version COVID instead attacking lungs, takes brains convinces reject masks gather thousands.

You joke (and yeah, kinda funny dark way) theory (hypothesis actually) lead poisoning much wide spread problem saw Flint MI. maybe cysts caused Toxoplasmosis.

I believe internet would mean lot people choosing believe completely outrageous option. 

COVID serious disease that's caused 800K deaths world wide shown verified scientists: or

Covid hoax made child rapist democrats scientists doctors it... Except one thinks disease cased sex demons. actually right.

I'm saying lead toxoplasmosis (it's probably not) something going that's making people stupid, crazy causing major lack critical thinking skills. TIL there’s 26 months year! 4.0

Wut equitable already debilitatingly inequitable situation. Kids need teachers help ever “letting fail” recipe low kids getting lower high kids getting higher. Three thing is, put ventilators die, even able admit wrong. honest answer know. chance look epidemiological stats neither specialised epidemiology. genetic correlations per se reported. Highly unlikely AASI predispose immunodeficiencies such. said something like CFTR gene mutations answer would conjectural yes. Thank God school systems around globe prepared shit online learning. /s Google moron. ...and leave boxes.

(•_•) 
( 
(⌐■_■) politicians equally corrupt. sides it.

Did right? can't win here. bunch people die, stats believed. trends downward, data falsified. People enjoy Floridians dying reason. Respect. Quite honestly time, way past controlling this. Herd immunity way till vaccine  Utah schools windows open. Washington schools windows open. California Schools windows open. many don't? actually look lung x-rays look like covid. problem making connection covid-19 samples sent testing test known illness like legionaries disease. 

the global medical system assumes know all. well diagnosing new pathogens. High school Band Director here. second year little rural school. went two members last year fifteen March. kids worked hard recruiting, fundraisers. trips, none things told would come pass. feel heartbreak. gets harder every week. never know till gone. Meanwhile india PM : UNLOCK 4.0 stupid , self serving puppet. “Hey, quiet there! hear virus coming way!” love right good world, please vote well. Way get emotional internet someone else differing opinions, look weak lmao, hurt man? damaged I’m fine people feel way long avoid healthcare finally get sick denouncing science medicine. see faint line too. Yeah go gov quarantine arrived Shanghai. nice ass hotel complaints lol make sure keep job gives health insurance ~~that job likely necessitate it~~ wont able afford meds otherwise.""

If preexisting condition requires medicine afford health insurance, choice. Real Carl Sagan would tell shut wear mask. 35 lakh = 3.5 million then? important context nobody look fence see happening places exposed Corona Corona considered problem. live island 1000 daily arrivals Wuhan. absolute fatality rate around 0.001%. still remember much coughing around December / January. considered cold. Nothing done.

Why fatality rates differ much?

Why nobody trying figure reason low absolute fatality rates? bullshit. boomers school 70s. want blame shitty critical thinking something, decline parenting. said it. bad parents overworked parents. parenting gotten worse. way knowing many people actually exposed second time proportion reinfected. I'm telling society needs assume lasting immunity proven otherwise. IE sick recovered, yes need mask take precautions. Better go tell kids need pick buggers entering house. I've taken seriously day one. mind blown testing insanely fucked up.

And honestly, point many doctors scientists U.S. take responsibility constantly saying ""there's evidence"" - masks (b.s. conserve PPE, Osterholm others cited highly suspect studies early March), aerosolized spread, asymptomatic spread (which really meant presymptomatic, way testing screwed too), feel like get shit benefits possibly using pool rapid testing. 

There's giant gulf admitting know, evidence points way saying ""there's evidence"" which, scientific standards depending scientist (cause science also conducted imperfect humans), could hundred different meanings exist continuum ""anyone common sense two brain cells see 99.9% likely true"" ""there's even circumstantial evidence prove true."" 

The second one would true transmission via surfaces, stop scientists doctors STILL insisting primary route transmission airborne aerosolized spread.

These phrases - ""no evidence, causative, studies imperfect biased"" - usual suspects U.S. mostly, become nauseating current atmosphere situation like this, repeatedly let good (and even, cases BETTER) become enemy ""perfect"" nearly two hundred thousand people died may chance science health U.S. admitted little less certain portrayed time.

I remember hearing phrases contact traced outbreak studies mentioned article MSNBC back MARCH. shit? Cause funded America big pharma done MIT? Countries like South Korea worked had, data, provided catch time, did. saw 1,100 people building mixed use appeared nobody outside 90 people single area one floor one SIDE building became infected, made REASONABLE ASSUMPTION surface transmission elevators common areas unlikely airborne spread was.

Christ, fuckery U.S. ever end? Here's article...  plot movie?
Bird box? found two find low spread asymptomatic patients. However, one preprint, small sample told keep door shut active shooter reasons

this part probably saddest Side effect bonus? sister married Canadian escaped Canada recently said complete pain ass go That’s resigned. Yeah illegal us strike NYC, planning anyway. kids could learn without interacting teacher, life would lot easier. happen way. plainly obvious smiling even mask on. Half smile eyes, unless faking person disorder can't read facial expressions clear day. Australia New Zealand good contact tracing, they're culturally Western standard. crazy parents asking it? daughter 90-120 minutes Zoom day second grade would say half classes parents PISSED insisting day streaming, uploaded extra work child complete daily. mind blown listening parents! teachers/admins ones like 😳. [But corporations people, friend! Everything corporations earn ultimately goes make this- point, that's nice fat fuckin' *if*\- need work way back every step got us first place. Philly actually. you? imported cases. It’s possible someone came contact started spread. doctor looked people tested caught asymptomatic case it’s possible spread anyone spread etc etc. vicious cycle unfortunately.  Obviously teachers don’t powerful union degree leverage either. wouldn’t working person now. No, stated clearly situation *does exist* wherein save lives. Quit using “all”. talking minimizing loss, ending this. many flawed; goal eradication zero loss life Covid (though plentiful consequential loss lockdowns alright eyes).

I believe sending military ensure elderly complying lockdowns. would never attempt control lives others here. us lockdown long elderly dying. solution focus ways make quarantine easier secure elderly reason death rate high. save all. surprise, many last year life without coronavirus...many refuse accept “deaths coronavirus” simply death old age...

You believe quarantining 65 work (without discussion around feel way) argue *everyone* lockdown. Brilliant logic! /s. population 7000. 10% got tested. 26 positive. said symptoms time testing. case reasonably certain actual number least 100 Sturgis. 650 worked event family those? Would nice tested 650 people August 1st. USA still deport families Sadly likely win since folks would let bigotry win common sense. want see black female vice president would rather vote stupid. Sad true. Sanders kind shot foot choosing her. campaign risky. campaign tried true order prevent Trump winning democrats optimistic thinking. Stay topic fucking ape - nothing complain ""empathy overload"" front page 

Really fuck off. College credits? 25 doesn’t mean aren’t working parent well. Living Tokyo.

As mentioned article, two things agree Japan done well elder care (especially due aging population fr decades) infrastructure Internet, electricity, water, etc. uphold it. grocery stores unions. used work Safeway join one work there. think you’re misinformed. Exercise good nutritional status always underrated! really. beliefs there’s much that’s going change it. question human behaviour need crowd. Meanwhile people still crowds coronavirus spread quickly, question responsability everybody avoid spread, spread covornavirus impacts health, social skills economy jobs... Go stand corner &amp; think done. know, correct spelling Teachers paid enough. getting paid 30k year them. Plus provide school supplies. Bro people degrees education. debt need pay life outside school. Teachers overworked underpaid. Much transmission sturgis likely happened giant bars, event halls, evening concerts.

University campuses activities indoors.

Public school held indoors.

What point think making here? never justified anything, saying God/Nature/Universe chaotic full destruction. Personally think person stupid believing religion including Islam (so nice assumption part).

But whole notion ""God"" exists, sort teddy bear, laughable joke. Islam, Judaism Christianity turns true, God sense nice person. accept Jesus put hell, Ghandi. Islam, accept Mohammed put hell? isn’t UN something? like child concentration camps US border? US would give visas UN commission inspect them?

[read people recovery entire lives. may proportional ""disease"" case. Yes helping derail  reason visit, reason would China giving permission Everything except collective trauma. There's going real mental health crisis recon lot people, particularly health care workers people lost someone COVID know died alone hospital. im student 3rd year college never ever frustrated school. left public teaching 5 years ago....your description gave much anxiety reading it. THANK kids. handled this. way. 

The greatest thing teaching engaging kids....and person tall order.... emotely??!?!! feel like satisfaction reaching kid (which STAY teachers think!) would GONE working remotely. magic classrooms think replicated online. 

But one classrooms COVID control. 

Teaching already 3 full-time jobs rolled one (prep, instruction, evaluation). add work less satisfaction remote teaching....teachers going happy bunch year....

Thank continuing give kids. got hanes masks, they're pretty crappy. equal wearing underwear mask number one comorbidity Influenza pneumonia, outside catch other. left article individuals tested asymptomatic time testing. testing reserved four different groups; city employees (mandatory), school district employees (voluntary), employees private businesses throughout community (voluntary), residents Sturgis (voluntary).

Another article says Sturgis testing event include individuals experiencing symptoms may tested locations. pretty interesting! Thanks concise perspective Improvement mean lift travel ban. need get numbers acceptable levels. US 40K cases instead 60K mean countries allow Americans in. reality. 

Hours worked parents don’t know naive are. 

I honestly think today trump said going use phone locations publish location data confirmed infected, people outrage. 

Do honestly think people say, problem several years go ahead? Facts. Keep masks everyone. Masks effective public home.

More spread happening home public reason. One person healthy gets virus. infect rest household.

Given risks lack negatives, reason wear mask public. I'm pretty sure pointing barbarism Islam justify treatment Muslims China.

I mean, aware Christianity also barbaric, correct?

Attacking religion dehumanize followers, kind nonsensical ass-backwards logic that? see, sure enough time gone London NYC. see. Perhaps it’s abundance nose hair lol! hope right subreddit thread. know A/C recirculate coronavirus back people articles studies, risk decrease overnight say like, closing time store opening time? really bell curve like anything else. Idiots always make tail end. Sincere question: direction think going? happened back day Europeans arrived. diseases killed millions native Americans Religion caused lot destruction history. people Muslim even others Catholics, Christians, religions use religion say morals bullshit. Religion used facade, people want do. Money comes morals. Small business owner here. opened July, fully expecting close end month. Crazy pretending virus doesn’t exist, there’s pandemic doesn’t actually work. work entertainment I've getting fucking steamrolled last 6 months. love work ill never stop right I'm editing documentary shot can't legally release fucking soul crushing working pay, possibly payoff. Every single infected person died recovered? Every one??? strain flu disappear Earth? mostly left UK groups follow online related labour party advertising fight Conservative restrictions society. find really interesting US appears mostly right campaigning imagined loss freedom covid conspiracy nuts seem left. No. rational dissent even remotely disinformation. Please find dictionary ASAP. Although incompetent, China become despised unwanted globally. Time evict CCP earth. 100 deaths “grim milestone”
500 deaths “grim milestone”
1000 “grim milestone”
1500 “grim milestone”

Arbitrary numbers aren’t milestones, wish news would stop reporting like state this?

Edit: nvm, see texas. Table 3 list comorbidity, E65–E68 2-3 years long time forever.  completely predictable actually predicted. 

Remember, US Secretary Education actively trying destroy public education. reacted early, make exceptions pointless luxuries, tolerate people self isolating supposed to.

Allowing people continue participate unecessary activities like dining out, gyms, barbers, movies, etc. keeping things awful west. 

All behave, won't. walgreens Houston tx number people wear mask comply law able enter walgreens effectiveness staggering. mean mask worn mouth nose. basically worn show shop. What's worse entering pharmacy store frequently visited people exhibit sick symptoms. Idk, think pretty whacky think somehow worse people past. really think people easier time seeing negative. metric worse person born 200 years ago? Oof. feel pessimistic future country. knew problems situation really showing deep problems run. completely context, whole purpose dehumanize entire group people. exactly easy people Muslims Myanmar, India China. known exposure COVID-19 asymptomatic.

Which fucking hilarious considering one symptoms corona is... asymptomatic.. nope go. forget call conspiracy shown mainstream media. Bye. #BrainwashedAnimals Rednecks rednecking. good boy Exactly. I’ve seen bunch articles athletes risk things like myocarditis. Basically mild symptoms don’t strenuous exercise. inflammation already problematic exercise, least strenuous exercise, may lead worse outcome. fuck care much personal life? Get grip dude, parents effect merit argument. Legitimate question: take effort remain ignorant? Well yeah US house Saud best pals. Birds feather that. Boris Johnson got sick COVID-19 hospitalized thought going die. 

He still feels effects, fatigue etc, announced going resign 6 months. Fox vaguely agrees things. seems like long something vaguely agrees known ""on side"" blindly follow whatever else say. Yes, see magical thinking lot. sub, general comes children.

Anyone sub 18 years old strange floating dichotomy human not. often expect children read see situations clarity adult also expecting cherub innocence keeps harm.

Children get shit end humanity stick, really. Sounds like excuse, seriously. Yeah, consider came down. kind fly take care grandparents I’m stuck garbage state run garbage men wondering hard move Canada I’m lol pop density

I tell know much Sweden/Covid-19 think inhabited parts Sweden matter comes spread. everyone pants shitter mentality. That's exactly four percent (4%), asymptomatic time testing, unlikely infected stayed isolated. means 4% could easily become 8% waiting results. talking about? 

They millions locked wuhan months relying food delivery sustanance.

They whole country locked early enough. Something rest world refused even watched china it. seeing normal amount people bars, restaurants, shops? Uncle worked Saudia Arabia (he Muslim) amount racism got something else. Saudi crashed driving work reason jailed worked foreign company. Saudi government among worst world. people coming NJ beaches state NY PA, also Covid control older generations taught school sit still listen orders 9 5 preperation work culture drastically changed, not? personal opinion effective (that key word) vaccine widely distributed/available shift mask/distancing mandates everyone mask/distancing *recommendations* people higher risk unvaccinated. many people eager get back normal much money stake kinds businesses current universal mandates last forever. said, agree many people still choose mask (and support that). may businesses like continue require masks long-term. think masks going away universally time soon. see *required* forever, even long-term, due public resistance idea.

Not saying smart way go, necessarily, I'd expect happen U.S.A. Wow good work derailing conversation here. Everyone jumped bait. Congratulations, handlers must proud many people like party nursing homes contained... course, numbers infected climbing Denmark speak. turns looking postponed kind curve, Swedish strategy shutting totally could considered better long-term.

The one thing Sweden failed early protection elderly, even certain amount specific retirement homes screwed pooch; majority not. call ex-alcoholic identity going clean, need get mental help. means haven’t moved on. clicked links. 
Not sure even read them.

This point clear them. ""They found facemasks facemasks plus hand hygiene may prevent infection""

May. already know hand hygiene does, addition masks make significant increase effectiveness.z

Maybe actually read links posted. literally justified God's wrathful discriminatory bias atheism saying universe chaotic (as God control it), fucking mess.

I genuinely feel sad religion turned people into. contact tracer advocate increased spread? many kids died covid? Facebook much times littered huge copy pasta posts zero sources say things like ""DR FAUCI SAID MASKS USELESS MARCH LYING US NOW?!"" Fauci scientist. give sure quote something probably opinions change based information that's science works.

These people seem get that. Every time knowledge brand new virus changes people seem call lie understand, differentiates ""just flu"" brand new idea capable of. we're learning go knowledge guidance going change. mean anyone lying means learned something new this. everything revolve around affects personally. Democrats panders arabs, republicans. like can’t control Arizona Nevada does. everybody go along permissive approach, end nothing.

It’s risk catching virus church somehow cancels risk catching casino, either. fact, allowing indoor church services going provide another way virus spread. make everything else, including going casinos, risky. still effective wearing mask.

I hope make idiots stop using social distancing. one absolutely best way avoid spreading virus. Please refrain politically-charged fake news scientific subreddit. 


India one worst tests per population rates world 118th place 30k tests per 1 million population. US 244k Russia 250k tests per mil. 


Even look total number tests neglecting population, India behind China US despite exponentially greater population. guy needs go jail. Sadly, probably looking Trump's successor. say governments spread disinformation, example WMD Iraq. fact, Chinese government censorship disinformation, example, Tiananmen Square. Thanks - I’m longer teaching, good know. Well government handled outbreak better then, they? Blame incompetence. problem ancillary stops along way gas stations, convenience stores, restaurants, bars combined state factor starts causing issues.

Especially state factor. Saudis notoriously racist surprising talking parents. teachers. Parents pushing send kids away someone else deal ""teachers"" Never anyone get anywhere life complaining (until is)

By way, absolutely care treatment elders relative COVID-19, it’s conversation isn’t them. Let’s separate convo later focus problems you’re suffering, don’t come calling people whiners we’re focused moment. 

It’s like said original post: “WHAT ME!?” boomer mentality it’s exactly you’ve done. Sincerely — hope people well need something let someone know. means little whining it.

It boomer taught *”the squeaky wheel gets grease.”* true not? 
What number lives saved giving credit shutting first place? purpose hybrid learning, prevent outbreak asymptomatic student/staff member attends school? understand safer full in-person learning. want keep kids' immunocompromised family members safe, online learning best option, right? could attack Islamic terrorism actually originates get even control currency oil sold in. Kind distracting Florida close half population California yet close COVID deaths; despite upward trends beginning time. That's nice you, thanks. Also, many cofactors obviously exist simultaneously, tend prevalent older people. much remains unknown. abusing black people, Trump want give medals. Thailand Vietnam me. countries done better geographical advantages.  rate dropping

Which is. said mortality rate can’t increase 

I not. asked would it. 

Extrapolate flaw reading comprehension apply rest ramblings. Also, show maths ""shitty"" please. easy claim back up, seem utterly incapable. No.

Exercising getting covid always unambiguously good.

Excercising currently infected covid known bad, though recent articles it, didn’t know even existed people believe continuing work sick. Yeah, false. it’s saying 6% people died COVID known comorbidities. shed light fact far biggest comorbidity simply old. Body positivity... get it. Noone wants feel devalued much food, can't control cravings garbage.

I'm obese. could like people blame ads, metabolism, genetics, basic physics calories in, calories out, equation currently balanced weight decrease increase. ate lot shit. crave garbage food time. I'm working it. realised garbage food sate me. makes want garbage.

 know virus 2x likely put hospital versus average age, 1.5x likely kill me. still small percent chance still.

The writing wall. Obesity kills. Ok so, overworked analogy, reason dragging others comply? mean, announced we're together Monday need least 95% compliance seems like everyone board pull trigger. But(!) there's small ideological group people make 10% refuses inconvenienced really wants go beach! They're selfish, short-sighted assholes, everyone else agrees that's case. So, magical fix can't work because, unless... create bunch work scientists make others wait little longer. point trying make? South Korea 5 minutes fame cult leader get infect 1,000 ""article"" implies COVID19 deaths overcounted April excess deaths show truth.

Garbage conclusions. Leaves much room bad actors feign ignorance slip cracks.

This life death. Everyone wearing masks time would reopen many opportunities millions people live with, work with, high risk group.

By trying appease comfort abled minority, punishing far far vulnerable citizens.

Masks required public spaces maintain equality opportunity pandemic. insist vulnerable take undue risk comfort few. defend country response. one paid make sure china looks good matter what. negative article go defend.

I afraid backlash speaking mind.

Now, lie China hiding continues hide happened Wuhan? Please. diplomatic nightmare China cooperate let people in. thing. read something day exercise even weeks covid risky. Specifically mentioned runners CrossFitters 30’s dropping dead heart attacks jogging weeks infection. 

I know you’re humorous pretty wild. don’t know much ozone for. dont time flip zone concentration enclosure reach every old crevice. sub isn’t big truth. It’s Cuomo good, Trump allies bad. states like NY see massive drops, celebrate (and rightfully so). Florida sees drop, it’s never mentioned, it’s part conspiracy!

It’s crazy watching sub act like virus picks side infect not. arguably anti-science sub Reddit, can’t wait see happens vaccine gets approved November.  Yup. I’m getting vaccinated - high-risk essential worker lives another high-risk person, expect I’ll first second wave. chicken pox isn’t vaccine doesn’t take me, means I’m going masked time next year, probably.  Well said mortality rate dropping also said mortality rate can’t increase, extrapolate flaw consistency throughout rest analysis it’s pretty easy theres facts - ""angry american"" speculation?? april?? yeah happier people dogs contribute gdp

I'm saying disagree you, I'm saying things measured purposes analysis first volunteer. Things worked fine China though. probably think problem still causing problems around world. Calling someone neck beard using word seppeku, peak hypocrite. Also, calling someone else self righteous trying dictate debate works, peak hypocrite. Yeah, always case, Gottlieb elaborates ""We're likely see stepwise progression authorization vaccine certain select populations higher risk either contracting bad outcome see full approval general population,"" Gottlieb said ""Face Nation."" ""I think, again, full approval general population, people go CVS get shot — that's really 2021 event, maybe first quarter 2021, probably likely first half."" Europe, let tell amount non compliance measures huge. That's intention kill many people possible, human nature strict measures losing support fast let go. That's western culture judging whether good bad, fact. 

What suggesting may saving lives ultimate objective people would always stay home nothing, obviously balance needs found. saying measures proposing hold people circumvent one way another. Close bars? People gather home. One person per household grocery store? People enter 2 minutes alone entrance. That's observation stricter measures going work way want to. 

Sure, could use military likely incite ton violence. Ultimately peoples actions vote, Europe people sick tired restrained. Coming back home. notice individuals cannot play team. people also aren’t fleeing active war zone. Massive difference. could make argument points Mexico narco war zones. many Central American immigrants choosing walk Mexico. 
It’s tough issue, really is. Reddit thinks zero immigration laws doesn’t hurt anyone. But, I’ve personally seen friends families construction get hammered economically competition illegal labor. It’s binary issue ***Article published April 9, 2020*** wasnt article said exercise could worsen covid? [desperate cope Nigeria, also wealthy country. Governments held accountable budgets. expect go war force happen?

Other agencies get enter investigate another country way seem think allowed to.  agree Saudi Arabian slavery unconscionable, might want take another look child camps US. Someone posted article, kids basically cages made chainlink fence:  Labor Day weekend plus false sense security interesting. mistake maths, hard demonstrate it. definition, US currently decline second wave. dont think anyone believes that. Many countries victims earlier success. nyc/northern italy/ Stockholm 2nd wave agree 2nd waves inevitable everywhere wuhan investigated outside agencies already?

What outside agencies? WHO? China sovereign nation. agencies get invade. investigations like done clandestine operations know obvious make sure people forget came Wuhan

No one going forget came Wuhan. one forgetting came china.

There several governments interested trying get forget bungled country's responses pandemic though. Get picture ashamed. time right backdown bot. paid unlike you, know bedtime coming.

Then answer questions ashamed, lay lies bullshit accusations working favor country said completely boycotted company deals knowingly fined.

Only someone scared ashamed would resort pathetic lies try divert attention fact utterly clueless level foreign diplomacy investigation works. feel bad working parents single ones. single mom mom stay kids sick. never ideal. part group stand them. Makes sense. Even EUA mainly meant specific people like medical workers. Well numbers probably wouldn’t exploded wasn’t mass protests lol. it’s inevitable cases rise winter, i’m hoping hard hit states like NY/NJ would spared, countries hit hard early like France Spain seeing spikes, dont think state safe. labeled crisis actor. still hold public torture beheadings Saudi Arabia... fucking sick fucks reason NYC, whatever reason part floor UV light reached Look happened 4th July. False sense security plus holiday weekend probably going going mix well. Maybe reading another weakness add math Avg life expectancy = 78.6 years age COVID 19 death = 78*

This one months old data may changed now, shows median age COVID death case study 78 years old. Table shown bottom webpage. April 9, 2020 Exactly. Reddit always hates everything USA also expects USA shining light time. 
Want huge example? Immigration. 
So I’m plumber painter USA vs Canada?
Reddit thinks USA devil Canada utopia. But, Reddit expects USA essentially total non-enforcement borders laws...but Canada restrictive immigration policy. I'm offended, paragraph ""what about"" post, actual statistics? relevant, like fact make irrelevant.

And clear sole ""downvote"" ""The Hispanic Heritage Awards, created White House 1987, commemorate establishment Hispanic Heritage Month U.S. awards considered one highest honors Latinos Latinos."" Partisanship hell drug. Goes ways though. RCT ever comes showing level effectiveness low-dose HCQ, somehow doubt going go frontpage sub. Please show calculation Deaths/Cases USA Globally comes anywhere near believe know. make plans international investigation

and many international investigations china allowed wuhan? live post 2016 world, get times. Deporting cruel enough. Take children, put cages, deport one parent, force one fight stay courts. Yup think that’s much bigger danger well-know scientists like NDT. 

There lot arrogant professors, know lot aren’t arrogant still well funded. I’m sure “arrogance” correlated success. good news? Spending five months sick and/or disabled sounds horrible. least compelling comparisons I’ve ever read. make easy headlines papers whose journalists unable unprepared research validate headlines. get eyeballs, even got eyeballs load real engineers here. That's argument. I've nothing encouragement young engineers give things go. much doubt student thought headline-worthy fact! April????? can’t imagine UN would consider international sanctions US, don’t much power beyond that. UN really selective addresses also ignored lot civil rights abuses Mexico, even citizens went UN council plead case. Thanks link though, didn’t know UN news page I’m going start following Yeah bro, let's go shoot rich people. Like 5 P's Pirating! Pillage, Pilfer, Plunder, Purloin PILLAGE! love Reddit. neck beard type “I declare” self righteous comedy. hope recover egg face. go commit seppeku Roopa12 told I’m dumb internet. could’ve developed dependence foreign oil begin sub, worldnews would never post this. know mean ""does"", ""dp'es"" also works suppose. Thank dropping truth sub. rare welcome sight. Llamas - really kick Covids ass!! /Barbra Streisand entered chat. agree. 

However, context beach (OP) people chilling households blankets space pretty low-risk, based current data need allow lot places. doesn’t say stroll boardwalk, specific outdoor event crowd, stuck next guy coughing aren’t areas full mask-up. 

As we’ve seen, mask shaming strict monolithic rules met active resistance. Carving exemptions science allows seems prudent. Beaches aren’t hill worth dying September. parks hiking trails many activities everyone wants doing. Butts-to-nuts concert, sure. this. Hey, thanks correction! would show evidence

Because that's making claims work. make claim, especially one wild mortality rate somehow increasing **16-50x**, back evidence. shitty math? 

Show mistakes maths then. cited figures. check maths yourself. article clearly states it’s deadly deadlier

No not. article states increased number deaths New York greater percentage Spanish Flu far less people dying general 2020 1918. city 100 deaths per year virus kills 100, # deaths doubled. city size 10 per year another virus comes kills 50, # deaths increased 6x despite virus half deadly. 

You even read article ""hurr durr deadly"" got it. largely Western thing.

This largely Anglosphere+German (one Americanized countries) thing. now. schools quarantining every week, really ""back normal"" that, given something around pretty much forever long-lasting repercussions economy interact society, pretty different 20 realizing little hope future 50 realizing same. thing climate change. life ahead you, damage happen lifetime, scared are. dramatic blame everything DeSantis. want blame somebody, blame banks. Every dollar deferred life long paid back. Banks unwilling defer payments things like mortgages, decision trickles hill. property owner can't pay mortgage, loose house/business/piece property. banks care, end taking property. 50 different states, states things way, things ways, end day banks never changed THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE American citizens died horrible deaths, decision Ron Desantis.

Now tell many deaths happened Cuomo, Newsome. Private schools open boastful. Yeah, disagree. Obama would’ve TALKED quite LOT. But, would significant foreign policy changes happened? doubt it.
Oil runs world, philosophy “the devil know” prevail Trump following India that's going happen. send hit pieces Epoch times. get CDC said 6% deaths true Covid. Rest old multiple conditions. It’s virus. spread. get recover gain immunity RemindMe! 3 weeks maybe, medical care probably can’t fired stay home couple days sick child. mother in-law (63f) went son (39m). actually believe virus exists, warrant strong lockdown measures. Apparently lockdown restrictions conspiracy banks profiting government's stimulus payouts. 

Yep, table talk super awkward moment. Absolutely! every eat buffet Canada frog legs. (well Quebec least cant say rest) New Zealand. Turns hot weather drives people inside sweet sweet AC spreads germs around really effectively. been? sub pro COVID whatever reason Amen. systems already tested repeatedly anyway. True. We’ve testing polio way 30 years. MIT first coronavirus April. idea US this. Chinese authorities many layers. local authorities might want deal angry citizenry bad reports scorecards, end exactly central government least interested in. many ways giant mess middle managers. Let’s hope. can’t cross fingers harder Oxford vaccine works. feels manipulative way headline worded. type procentual growth useful show actual numbers headline. death rate Emergency care rate went like would much bigger problem. Nah, think people dishonest objections. K keep seeing people talking like something new FDA planning. confused suddenly everyone seems thing discussed back March/April people discussing idea semi-positive light. FDA even published EUA guidelines back June/July, remember correctly. Phase III trials continue late 2022, wait Phase III trials completely basically gotten virus point anyway, seeing half country still taking seriously Implying men complain..? Yeah, that’s kind point though. I’m socially liberal also believe capitalism greatest means ingenuity advancement ever. it’s flaws frankly it’s gotten hand. But, reign in. 

Basically, gave giant list things Dems 85% disagreed with. Taking tax dollars spend high speed rail, weatherizing homes, Solyndra, etc often unsuccessful super-inefficient. 

Actually, prefer Republican approach two, yep, said that. 

Now do, show Republicans in-bed fossil fuel industry also subsidize industry heavily. 

Give tax breaks green energy, stop subsidizing sides, get way. market handle this. incentivize go green efficiently. Reward results production. 

There something besides Republican comic book villain levels corruption greed, Democratic thinking government picking winners way go. stated, ""the Rₑ likely still .8 1"", agrees statement. 

My point extreme reduction cases attributed exclusively reduced infection rate. majority decline cases likely attributed reduced testing minority reduced prevalence. Ah yes.  one persecuted poor president. extend logic Chinese government sole responsible deaths world Cuomo lol new cases decreasing... consider ""under control""? get whole point EUA every question answered long safe decent amount effectiveness approved.

And vaccine trials require fairly regular checkups presume monitor antibody levels. allow assess long vaccine last. Oxford said media reckon vaccine give immunity least 12 months essentially means boosters vulnerable every year. Sturgis, turgid, turdhead. US like ""hold coffin"". Eh, he's actually expressing strong opinions. He's describing arguments people published papers heterogeneity-modulated herd immunity thresholds. pretty accurate summary. He's good science writer. ya catch 'rona? majority population underlying health conditions listed 94%? common ones like obesity accounted something like 3% covid deaths. [Did read woman state level responsible background checks gun sales lost password said fuck approved whole year background checks. don’t cancel wrong people equally wrong direction. Horrible. I'm disgusted this. California shows bazillion percent increase COVID19 cases despite keeping everything closed down.  

Am right? think fairly large % population heard seen Fauci TV month Floridians right now: ""Fuck masks. FREEDUM!!""

Source: know Floridians. One literally tweet today ""Went Daytona today. Masks compulsory zero compliance. Fuck love country!"" rammed vaccine practically none standard testing 

This false. candidate went phases clinical trials vaccine company manufacturing leading candidate never produced anything previously compared Theranos.

Moderna leading candidate anymore. Pfizer Oxford ahead country doesn’t believe virus real, half already regards vaccine snake oil.

You data support this. can't say many willing get vaccine none approved yet. China, Spain, Iran Italy example NYC... solution send positive patients nursing homes. literal risk group. big numbers means good right? 1 death U.K. today yet cases increasing lately. haven’t checked sub while, people think death rate seems deceasing compared months ago?

Edit: downvote question? people strange individuals  point even trying make?

OMG thank confused reading post... 94 year old man survives pandemic 102 years ago! kid stayed home every sniffle, sore throat, cough - he'd miss half year. No

We reaching herd stupidity percent france Depending numbers, think may slip cracks. going interesting see happens.

And add likely scenario kinds serious problems show practice long game time. anybody meaningful heart damage unlikely start lack performance practice keep field. ever see people humans. Lmao tf would delete. I’ve said nothing factual. Different situations. photos AOC crying Saudi fenceline. Like what. Well work thing matters America, don’t know unhealthy teenagers sacrifice sleep worry without years data collection vaccine typically idea long last effective be. get vaccine go back “normal” doesn’t last months we’ll real trouble then. stop. getting retarded, time break internet.  People start dying people start wearing mask own. That's pretty good assessment it! want slightly accurate version: SARS-Cov-2 virus. Infection virus introduced body begins replicate. clinical *disease* caused result infection SARS-Cov-2 COVID-19.

(The distinction infection virus gets starts replicating; disease actually feel demonstrate clinical symptoms.)

Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) one possible complications disease COVID-19.

This important though; purposes, explanation correct! Might be, I'm really US politics must say situation really bad. 


But still thing better us.
Our government money left even pay states share taxes, we've virtually given up. Everything's back normal schools opening soon (for context, school 3K children, fair biggest school state). 50% wear mask 50% nose uncovered. Though (almost) anti masks protests, people believe things like corona affects bad deeds, Homeopathy treat easily there's need worry. People going isolation period. often see groups marks nothing happened. People celebrating birthdays, partying going restaurants like nothing happened. (I come Dehradun, low density, relatively educated city) 


Although agree leaders least tried control it, unlike USA, worst possible way could've done they've given now. basically delayed inevitable. all? 0.7% IFR, 50% population exposed 75,000 dead people Florida alone. one going suddenly change mind vote vaccine getting emergency use authorization.   common sense news worthy? Okay got next headline Mr. Editor: ""Don't Piss wind, drunk guy warns."" favorite, ""Don't put dick blender, dickless man warns."" read link see distorting see graph deaths country compared previous years. look numbers look monthly compared worst months last 20 years order relate bad really country. specific think misrepresenting? Good call, I’ll try tact. Thank kind person enjoy day *after trump leaves office*

""Not gonna happen folks"" /s Weren’t told hot weather would slow spread? Nuke orbit friend constantly posts Covid hoax, etc..  me, distant family, three members got it. One ended coma. two cousins mine months “recovering still awful effects. amazing shape can’t walk 15 minutes completely exhausted. 

I’ve told friend family members mine multiple times.  

She still posts it’s hoax never “met anyone got called virus”. don’t care human rights CDC said that? accurate data resources support claim?  guess highlights important connected community. brother-in-laws kid got sick neither could stay home half dozen people church could call would stay kid day they'd return favor later needed. things work. reflected original comment downvoted upvotes, way go guys👍👏👏 pay work clothes lot stuff use work either. perfect representation mainstream covid narratives Mexico probably 5-8x higher confirmed counts based doctors people handle death certificates say. Also, often test dead, amount dead greatly undercounted many people die home due fear hospitals die never get tested. Florida hasn’t done everything wrong FFS. getting tiresome. NYC LOT though, Florida much. Since 2000. Good luck trying date let alone find spouse start family. need top comment. People used reading headline filing blanks preconceived notions. I'm guilty too, need better.... Someone hear out. lost sense smell battling mild cold. long loss smell last ? Im stressed. called SIR epidemiological model. definitely massaged, overall look like improving.

[Testing down, positivity [hospitalisations Jesus christ maybe dense Research suggests frequent testing campuses drastically reduce number cases course semester. every school fine... agree. tiring. election year one would care. would care Hillary running re-election. Trump, problem. need review bunch statistics pick ones make situation look worst you’re writing article. Bullying nature big deal. doesn’t bother me. almost prefer it. new? thought already knew FDA issued emergency approval guidelines vaccine since Phase III trials continue late 2022 Police said could everywhere, perhaps  need assistance bundeswehr Ppl overreacting. 4? closer 6. great,... read security prpblema using uvc light home. I’m teacher. I’m tired... agree. Cuomo got showered praise press conferences New Yorkers dropping like flies. time, CA flattened curve fraction deaths cases ignored.

For past couple months now, narrative ""CA messed much comoared New York"" even though hospitals never even come close overwhelmed difficult imagine circumstances ever match New York's death toll despite twice population! seen look it. still boggles mind every country planet, US one police presence schools full-time.  Site? spent even minute searching seen vaccine candidates own, genocidal muppet. upto million tests day now. Started much lower largely scaled spread infection

I think early infections numbers low testing limitations that's suggesting. positive rates mostly &lt;10% outside worst hit cities. Yesterday 80k new cases 1.05M tests. Covid 19 hoax, VASTLY overblown.

Exactly. Hate one tell I'm common saying Oopsie locked  Wow, stay home 10 days positive symptoms two negative tests 24 hours apart. grabbing knife!!!!111!1! American experiment corrupted, failed. American experiment allowing stakeholders (property owners) say what’s best instead deferring class knows what’s best. 

Concentration power federal level leads national politics leads deferring powers be. Return power states. I'm honestly surprised India arrive sooner.

8 weeks strict lockdown slow spread considerably duration. Since infection spread faster. least gave us time ramp testing capacity, medical production etc duration. contract agreements strike Florida, told teacher mom entire union REFUSED go back agree teach online. gonna do, hire 2,500 non-existent subs? state would one officer per high school would also service middle schools elementary schools feed high school. old guy close retirement. time dealt unruly parents. **Texas, Florida similar state rising infections**: ""Ha, stupid leaders, teach conservtards!""

**California New York rising infection rates**: ""No, understand, different""  union lobby, negotiate, state law. absolute wankers. Let's see many think hoax 2 weeks' time start experiencing symptoms. See really comparable bad flu (which pretty bloody bad is; trivialise bad flu I'm willing bet they've never actually one). Motherfucker Evil stupid. Worst part much India slow spread. India went hard early pandemic, zero economic activity 6 weeks parts India cases all. make worse economic damage forced lot reverse migration cities rural areas, taking virus corner areas. 

Now govts public broke go sort lockdown all. Public also fucks give, highly doubt comply lockdown requests confident placing side group; i've watching lunatics told us years russia responsible evils world, brexit huge corporate conspiracy laughable *someone else* could fall propaganda sophisty conspiracy.

the absolute irony starting conspiracy theories ending literal conspiracy theory would delicious destructive sad. align people, kind person, gets nothing done divides; say one true thing russians, they're probably fucking loving constant misinformation misattribution themselves.. literally jobs them. India Subsaharan Africa ""generally healthy"" populations. Quite opposite. populations suffer high degree chronic malnutrition poverty-linked health issues (such endemic parasitical water-borne illnesses exposure industrial chemicals). Diabetes rampant among Indian middle upper classes Subsaharan Africa absolutely horrendous numbers HIV positive individuals. It’s China least two months too, caused recent spike Vietnam. rules changed massively. Fed government huge expense state power. National narratives rule culture instead practical local narratives people actually connect reality. That's bit harsh, couple wankers hate us all? nothing remarkable whatsoever. I’m beginning question average age sub, anyone ever held job knows bit PR 101. Stephen King chapter Stand.  Unpopular opinion: teachers hard time remote teaching technology never good teachers begin with. can't handle tech, teacher. NC union, powerless. wish would strike go building. Great answer, thank taking time explain!

That said... infected time period think infected, approaching end 6mo window. Guess I’ll go back hermit lol. founders exact intent. Power centralized federal level 200+ years. saying is, exercise keeps healthy? Hrmmm.. u sure? Sounds fishy.... True, can't understand comprehend administration's thought process Unlock-4.0. Winter coming up. potential deadly second wave brewing. There’s vast difference level risk states/regions fewer 5 cases per 100,000 higher levels. 

Where community spread intense they’re still opening schools f2f learning: well, object lesson. also forced come work remotely. instead 2nd grader able house entertainment comfort day, he’ll husband’s classroom. makes sense. show parents work. let everyone thread give 101 trump literally satan incarnate. point absolutely true, people resonating frequently abject hypocrites unable see beyond surface level view world politics, sorts statements always go hand hand ""and fuck right wing"", sad see prevalent is. look CDC excess deaths it’s around 250k One potential source risk older, mercury-based UVC lamps, well lamps emit ozone, toxic lungs -- newer, UVC LED lamps potential hazard, well. biggest concern, UL's experts say, uncontained devices like light wands could potentially expose user's eyes skin invisible UVC light close range, causing damage.

After month lockdown, still two two weeks lockdown go, public support massive:

72% support 8pm curfew
over 70% support restrictions able travel 5km “In total, 63 flights B.C. added BCCDC’s warning list [infected people onboard] August, including 17 international flights 46 domestic flights.”

Just quit youre embarrassing now. Districts planning since January world found COVID. sounds like failure every level, State Federal level. Good know US alone right wing imbeciles. Yeah I’m good. Rather shocked 10 posts SD spiking single one AZ, TX, FL success numbers looking amazing three states. It’s almost comically depressing around here. I've heard good number recent accounts theaters near empty folks. every theater packed people, dipshit. Damn pray I’m teacher, could retire really want make May. probably go back person October unless Arizona explodes again...and wouldn’t surprise one bit. 

I told wife kid brings room infection spreads...I walk quit. Bruh enough go coordinated strike, won’t teachers teach kids state cave. He's obviously teacher, course he's personally going care kids. Would call health worker working elderly 'messed misguided' caring older patients rather kids?  problem academia present actually, covid notwithstanding. Graduate students postdocs treated like indentured servants power dynamic massively imbalanced. mention lot professors top got narcissistic assholes, newsflash working students death produce results. burn out, get fresh new crop start again. reason rate depression 50% PhD students.

As result this, decade training need compete 1% job lack mental financial stability, many people choosing leave academia graduate degree. know several people left knew would slide major depression continued. sad thing every damn year major publications carry articles academia becoming unsustainable career path, absolutely steps taken. number good that’s actually best way get time. worry much it’s gonna get better here. wanna keep catastrophizing based nothing keep depressed choice. traffic jam you’re already late liberal comparing universities rest country, certainly liberal would find general population Alabama. Southern states immoral... I’m shocked rate even schools anymore. America get even dumber. be. retire, good them. Make country beg get back. Make country things need done. America proven deserve teachers. Time change that, figure. article big fucking deal gets attention sub. left many months ago. Ridiculous. Here's novel concept: care one occupation affected.

It's weird people think there's finite well. Says commenter saying think realize. kids absolutely excelled distance learning too. work quality went immensely. (And wasn’t parents it.)  

I teach high schoolers asynchronous learning. morning posted lesson done midnight. able tackle tasks completely time I’m sure enjoyed sleeping in. really shocked quality getting. 

Granted struggled. Students executive functioning deficits hell time. down, wet dry, Karens valid point...
Hahahahaha........we're gonna die. Facts quite inconvenient times. bet outbreak would convince otherwise. YES Everyone needs lower expectations next school year. Mexico best since cant afford ipads everyone. However feel distance teaching also lacking. nephew gets two thirty minute sessions us minutes break Ride free die....guess know choice made community college almost revolt disgustingly poor transition online learning. Shits still resolved last winter semester. ended FAILING 2 last 5 classes piss poor transition. Teachers didn’t know do, gave assignments impossible understand instructions, deflected blame everyone else, continued let entire class fail. wasn’t class, widespread. 

People barraging deans office counselors. Nothing handled. essentially said “you’re screwed” aren’t willing understand situation all, we’re start another semester...... looked worldometers.info found US dropped top 10 deaths per million. course probably couple years go, race ineptitude over. Oh yes horrible way die faith, id rather nature choosing faith one else choosing faith Probably combination hitting level herd immunity specific cities/communities, people finally taking things seriously, DeSantis twisting numbers. there, done that. professional vacuum treatment get rid dead eggs. school aged daughter could go back school, preschooler could 💯 gone. really see ""lack routine"" instead perhaps cases ""able work clock"". 

I would loved able spend day sleeping school night school. 

Instead slept day school could stay awake, spent night reading.  building safe work in. union requested (demanded loudly) remote start. going marking cycle. 

We offer live meetings lessons 50% normal schedule. Everyone google classroom, theyll least 11pm counted attending school day. 

Most teachers comfortable using google classroom. easy use, require least training time set everything up. I'm starting September 8th DL required lesson plans...I can't imagine creating lesson plans daily shit storm. Hope taking time 🙏  Amen. Unfortunately reasonable work. co-workers know we're treading water eventually go fully online. prove parents tried get kids building. Meanwhile, could developing solid online curricula, instead continually told use bitmojis build social-emotional connections students! family member mine works pretty wealthy school district, even know they're going building yet... Monday.... hell teachers supposed plan??? Given numbers universities, going shit show. Remote learning tons drawbacks time. There's winning... Nah it, solved covid. Congrats Dear Florida,

I think go separate ways see people.

Canada Red Cross blood donations, might still extrapolate, hundreds caught rally passed thousands others since then? see friends Orange County anything want. One pregnant going restaurants, hanging friends large baby shower party. get it. ? meant world health organization.. See ya.  US can't lock like this. spread across country much China did. remember sub back Feb. China poured whole country's resources one region stuff down. can't hot spots country. Adapt overcome.. ""resign whine"". . It’s hard acknowledge massively lucky nope get rescue dog instead Covid. 

Edit: paying forward worthy species. know sucks scary confusing, *PLEASE, QUIT TEACHING!*

We need public educators ever. teachers start quitting, sign trump rest GOP/his base public education failing! WANT private education, that's exactly trump devos want; private schools/teachers less people able give children education!

I'm begging quit! like 10,000 spoons need knife. *WHOM hardest thing. lockdown. mask. social distancing. can’t stupid. mother teacher.
No one knows use online portal, asked, told ""it's gonna go.""

Its shit show 4x size US. Ohio here, 21 deaths today, please send source reporting 150 deaths...ohio never daiky death count high.

Here covid ohio please link source... true. really grinds gears Covid denier gets mild case. run around telling everyone it’s big deal. truth got lucky. Many schools made sweeping changes summer. case, I'm teaching course taught 10 years helping person took old course. 

Plus, know format classes week teacher PD days started. moment somewhere 1/3 1/2 class participating online, rest come 2 days week (Mon-Tues &amp; Thurs-Fri). week figure teach students online person time. addition procedural logistical changes building - monitoring 1 way hallways, cleaning desks classes, etc. Duh..... All. Of. The. Fucking. Data. By. Mandate. Must. Go. Thru. The. Corrupt. White. House. Before. Release. 

Nothing remotely true you’re ‘hearing’ far numbers. people like fence garbage give credibility lies bullshit. don’t need intentional sheep times like this, buddy. Kick fucking rocks. due respect. wife remote learning good bad she’s adapting beats alternative real test. mom literally year away getting minimum pension (she's taught 50 years, 14 years union) tech-disabled elderly person, ready quit this. keep pleading stick out- least, QUIT, let fire her, comes it, least try coast bullshit. 


Even great risk age, ready willing go back classroom teaching risk virus, remote teaching might kill first. sounds dramatic, talk ledge every day. makes want punch every anti masker see!!! 🤬🤬🤬 Reduce pressure = better mental health.

In Florida’s case, see metrics improving. Due questionable data quality state, I’ve also looked news stories allude overflowing hospitals. I’ve seen nothing points secretly worsening situation Florida. pandemic assumed people around surrounding area thought similar caring others.

The sentence clearly suggests college board directors decided open want get paid. pointing college's board directors likely volunteer position. Nobody getting paid. sentence wrong. inject corona eye lids! Thx  campus police officer decided become teacher. Went back officer year due high stress levels, said. Single parents don’t live upper class neighborhoods? I'm one spewing anti science nonsense. bump make claim, back sources. source claims? example, terms flawed science coverups, know whether China's record better worse America's record. source says Chinese vaccine potentially flawed, please share. Also, vaccine development pregnancy hugely different. hard fast rules creating vaccine way creating human life. Even know that's wrong ridiculous comparison.

Your argument resources thrown covid vaccine faster. gave link FDA shows typical time stage 3 trial takes years observe. matter much resources throw problem, cannot speed observation time. comparison throwing women speed pregnancy apt. Lock house years enjoy ruining life

My life fine. Thank asking. get vaccine stop public health nuisance.

This problem right here. Someone want take rushed covid vaccine public health nuisance. shown (with source opinion), earlier rushed vaccines turned cause permanent harm. natural careful rushed vaccine, matter British, Russian, Chinese, American, whatever countries comes from. need bully people taking rushed vaccine. another clickbait headline. vaccine, highly contagious, much deadly previous variants. fact lays dormant two weeks showing symptoms still contagious whole time troubling. sufficiently short wavelength, ""far uv"" damage skin cells mammals. research used 222nm uv 

This recent development, though. yet seen actual products offered, components manufacturers might eventually integrate. College professors universally this. Millions people lost jobs, hundreds thousands dead, teacher Zoom? infantile perspective. Yikes! Sounds like it’s pretty difficult finding right balance. 

We’ve try grocery stores found one got mostly right. Probably November since Trump want say “I got vaccine authorized!!!” get re-elected almost people dumb general. matter they're from.  prevents ever entering Canada again. problem solved title clickbait? sounds headline. MIT dept. political science probably co-host course session called "" politics COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 United States"". I'm confused thought Phase I/II data safety, efficacy? one taking seriously. It’s going long winter. Cringe yes, full-on peer-reviewed RCT yes! downvoting maybe read RCT it.  Deaths usually lag cases \~2 weeks. mind fucking us all! seems though German police least intelligent. US police would joining far-right protesters. Good. offense US handled pandemic, want consequences reckless behavior here. Headline altered reflect bad news necessarily stated article. Actually, tuition fees term cost exactly three whole dollars lmao 1918 Flu Pandemic killed Great-Grandfather young adult son. point was, given subreddit already needlessly pessimistic add low figure pulled arse? It’s. Just. So. Simple. 

I don’t get people fucking badly. 

Highly Contagious + asymptomatic spread + Airborne + high death rate + not-clearly-understood long term damage various organs. 


It means, everyone could without appearing sick + don’t touch anything anyone get + get entire family/group/class sick quickly without realizing it. get it, may die permanent damage important organs. 


Which means stay fuck home try get spread it. 

Why ducking hard understand? lot New York City victims buried potter's field: families quickly come money funeral, funeral homes morgues running places store bodies. single rumor everything say public information. Please point single rumor provide pre-print RCT fully peer-reviewed paper. silence deafening  done!

I'm sure I'd throw ""well"" done, least they're easing it. u expected?50k cases daily u reopened schools like wtf?We 100cases daily semester full online Nothing top ten, best stuff graduate programs still even particularly good. Prices risen much response football program? 

And again, football program isn’t increasing school ranking, actually giving merchandise value back school. clearly vested interest still haven’t gotten point. STOP investing fucking football fix school. 

Sorry it’s good school. wasting peoples’ money. Honestly universities now, state needs break, tax trying get education. UAB would probably better deal, especially going medicine, otherwise try Georgia. don’t think he’ll returning Canada face court proceedings. implied rolling vaccine tested. incorrect also ignores previous safety tests already conducted low key. absolute HATE getting vaccines. anti-vaxxer means, physical sensation someone sticking needle body absolutely freaks out. 

I’d still take 5 doses vaccine means shit over. It’s worth mental health share link comment, downvoted oblivion reason. visit sub often; users always hostile towards facts data?  husband boat. High risk...no chances taken. groceries delivered, clean alllllll (wahhhh) &amp; plan going emergency occurs. miss family most. bbq &amp; entertain lot summer. finding things stay sane. always easy though. Stay well, can't tell wish well either way!!!! Well Corona. parents went live month symptom-free week. I'm healthy, eat healthy exercise lot, symptoms minimal. weird.  Um, trying argument thin air. Nowhere assert going 50% effective. mean, yes, many vaccine candidates low effectiveness discovered well phase 3 trials, sure.

But specifically said EVEN 40% still better nothing.

Meaning: even ends perfect vaccine. still better one all.

Does make sense you? guess incorrectly. couple reasons: went weeks time without leaving house depression hit critical mass. sense normalcy errands helping cope. Second reason, local groceries absolute terrible job ordering/curbside. Last time tried order groceries took 3 days pick order. half ordered missing (and half tried order said ""unavailable"" online that, stock inside store, ended quarter essentials shop person anyway).

I wish kind easy B sort approach, panic/depression/anxiety complex set triggers. wish could least sell sone art, even money run prints. little independence craziness would help much.... work stoppage

Since illegal work? Imagine teachers paid police officers, imagine numbers people wanting teachers. asking PCR test article? real-world implications. Read it. cant lower cycle threshold testing available every day. Testing available every day cheap antigen tests widely F.D.A. noted people may low viral load newly infected. test less sensitivity would miss infections. problem easily solved, Dr. Mina said: “Test again, six hours later 15 hours later whatever,” said. rapid test would find patients quickly, even less sensitive, viral loads would quickly rise sure politicians spent taxpayer money trips. easy spend money own... Lol upper class neighborhood anyone else see CDC reorganized statistics found virus 6% mortality comorbidities? Here's link anyone interested: really going give benefit doubt.  God speed 1 patient infect 90000 people

Source? masking social distancing. 

Is school college insisting masking social distancing? overestimated peer pressure also college students would follow cdc guidelines.

This kindergarten kids behave Thailand. unreasonable expect college kids better. point, would argue making miserable extent cautious. nothing wrong going shopping park. Wear mask, don’t touch face, use hand sanitizer/wash hands stay away others. share link.

not screenshot page. Restaurants, chains independents actual restaurants manager part regional teams. 

Technology, sales departments hardware software engineering departments. 

And owned business 8 years.

I'm saying experiences industries perfect, holy cow. schools worked very, authoritarian. feel like people understand concept exponential growth. People starting sound like want vaccine fail, pandemic keep going, countless people die, alternative running risk looking like Trump right (the kind right broken clock day.)

I'm lifelong Democrat, hate Trump, *skipping* polls vote him, come on, people. That's full story, trailer park boys documentary proves otherwise could get incredibly lucky something 80-100% effectiveness...but general, know get data people getting exposed virus able fight off.

Fortunately really issue case given COVID hotspots world. 

I'm sure aware phase 3 trials typically take long due limited resources, difficulty recruiting also issues getting strong signal regards immunity; hard prove vaccine works virus vaccinated commonly circulating population.

Also none indicates vaccine would low effectiveness. again, wheres proof source going sub 50% effective.  pretty sure that's normal start classes students China ... stay out! Please!

Every place that's reopened spike. doctor cares covid patients fills death certificates, list factors contribute death heart disease, kidney disease, etc. means many people die covid pre-existing conditions, already knew. people young pre-existing conditions. high blood pressure doesn’t mean would died it. cases, healthy person come covid heart attack. heart attack may listed proximate cause death, often written heart attack due covid. no, true 6% deaths due covid. I'll preface saying wearing masks good idea, wearing one day causes nose get runny humidity causes nasal drips coughing.

I’m wondering school experience autonomous coordinated national level. example, could network teachers live-streaming 10th grade science vids YouTube. Students tune want, local teachers asks watch it. elementary school teachers reading stories. even teachers small group kids working together, students watch that.

It seems silly local classroom teachers would bust asses provide ok experience, easily pull together resources know-how teachers give kids something engaging interesting. seems obvious standard 30-students-per-teacher-for-8-hours effective right now.  notice even attempt refute accusations, complain accusations made. Interesting. 

But we'll block anyway point listening wife beating ways. Hooded... Lizard? Say, ever worked maid before?  Lockdowns don’t work long run people don’t want locked down. severe consequences lockdown protests completely understandable. world imposed economic calamity like never before, could far reaching consequences.

Keep mind, deal first hand since face face. teach elementary school, working young children using programs they've never seem before.

How dare YOU, pushing teen suicides side, upwards 800% areas?

How dare you, effectively eliminating 90% social support non profits globally, help treat diseases, feed people, care get couch for.

You know Nazi Party came power? people like you, refused think logically raw emotion. logic keeping people shut force people starve can't work. exactly way Nazi's gained power. 

Social pressure. Nazi's promised many things, return praised it. true bad governor, seeing protests everyday Florida asking resignation. fact not, suggests voters Florida ok performance. 10,000 idiots* trouble managing regard students per class? trying treat brick mortar learning would recipe disaster. same.

All really need todo give lecture, answer questions end, students part keep repeating assignment get it. fail.

French authorities report mainly 40s getting (which pretty much ideal situation).

Expecting younger people put life hold vaccine something seriously affect unrealistic unfair. Pneumonia caused viral bacterial infection common cause death elderly. cold lethal elderly.

I entrepreneur interprets “300 million people need multiple masks each, months future. That’s lot money made.”

Thing is...we knew that. know made (similar) claim paper wrote February. Point still nothing. Even altered announcement unlikely significant impact due abundance misinformation right gate fauci government said “masks important, everyone wearing one”, absolutely.

I disagree. enormous amount alternate misinformation play would minor impact. 

Clear governmental announcements important, however, doubt it'd make truly significant dent. bigger issues tackle combination.

Misinformation rampant point is...now people made conclusions. seeds sewn.

It's downright ridiculous teachers need second job order pay bills. Teachers foundation every job. 

I wish every teacher luck there. go back classroom days. one wants vaccine fail. Everyone wants shit anyone votes Trump vaccine comes November rather December they’re dipshit. don’t want political interference fucking assessment safety efficacy vaccine, President Schools football season catastrophic  Thank you, agree. IMO It’s unfortunately huuuugely ignored problem title I/high need schools US. But, health insurance workman’s comp cover physical therapy least part system worked. Disney's customer relations.... China helps lot countries investing forgiving loan, lot good world. brief interaction spread virus. talked 10 minutes I'd worried. Oof. That’s kind like leaning alcoholism lose job house alienate loved ones it’s rock bottom! Maharashtra badly hit? Nagpur going like anything. north seeing anything like this.

Is AASI genes reason? untouchable haha month ago grocery pickup guy walked car farted. Moments later thought someone set damn stink bomb off. realized set air pull outside. rolled windows. wearing mask could smell thru mask. got home found self googling catch covid fart. Since make certain air circulation set inside car. Unlikely catch covid fart. FYI. could I'm sure woulda I'm sure would sick now. Side note... wtf. dude shit pants something wrong him. teachers paid poorly yet teachers make difference, district realized could pay better poach best teachers? Certainly SOMEWHERE enough money afford so?

Or teachers actually make much difference? going succeed, going average, subpar, excellent teacher?

Face it, teachers truly brought value themselves, they'd command better pay. Reality one teacher good next they're effectively replaceable.

Let's please start sharing anecdotes Ms Jenkins 4th grade changed life. trajectory set despite assigning reading third grade. sound ignorant, like person nothing say slings around innuendo, muddying water, hoping someone agree make look smart. look smart. look like someone enables enemies attacking guardians, really pretty dumb way be.  too. Today work overheard colleague talking customer totally making light pandemic basically saying masks work, etc. one point said (I'm paraphrasing memory), ""It's big deal. got COVID I'm fine.""

I wish realizes precisely lucky contracted mild case, even able work month infected COVID. Plus, honestly, think ""fine,"" hardly - special accommodations, including chair sit register, physically unable stand 2 hours straight. understand COVID, there's good chance lung damage permanent irreversible. may never breathe well used ever again. CDC says [6 10 chronic illness. cares people talk shit grade wife teaches? represent teachers. way Covid dealt professions justifies concern that's voiced. joke anything? misread caption thought passed away upsetting commented it. comment realized misread it. Who's talking mandatory vaccines? Even purple reopen restaurants. true

No, horseshit. Even VIrus came Wuhan, Tsingdao thousands Kms away. like Italy Origin virus write, ""Oslo, Birthplace coronavirus'""

Tsingtao like 100 virus cases total? virus going away anytime soon (or maybe ever). marathon, sprint. need stay sane, otherwise what's point surviving virus? friends, family going - one's gotten sick. take precautions - masks, social distancing, staying outdoors etc. know enough virus point say chance getting taking precautions low many things likely die from. Stay smart, stay safe, follow science. Maybe worn masks mean kinda expected settler colonialist regime. How'd NY NJ many deaths short timespan? There's people saying lot mis-reported deaths. However I'm assuming COVID-19 widespread community realized it. many cases think actually tri-state area? There's absolutely zero proof started Wuhan. ""Spanish Flu"" again. made honest mistake. said UK part EU without thinking. ignorant me. fault! they... establish maintain... standard something? Maybe get ""how loaded you?"" thing effectively treat isolate likely spread it? number matter long run excess deaths vital records. People dying home undiagnosed Covid-19 count, people never Covid-19 avoided medical care pandemic count. die avoided unnecessary travel traffic accidents count. 

US states widely varying reporting here, deaths attributed Covid19 ranging 50-95% excess deaths. countries worse, Mexico City's reported deaths 27% excess deaths, meaning real human costs nearly 4 times great reported. 

When someone dies coronary heart disease health crisis precipitated Covid19 (which attacks heart, lungs, kidneys, brain, testicles...), still died premature death due Covid19. left academia March position private sector. decade degrading pay conditions teaching Universities Midwest, longer justify sacrifices family make. 

Without major reform, education every level continue get worse. Distance learning / online classes could work quite well people would simply stop trying treat online school though sort proxy little red schoolhouse.

Online schooling needs thing done way, effective. teachers trying pretend zoom meetings still classroom recipe frustration sides.  need people go stand tyranny Oh shoot you’re totally right that’s fault there. ignorant me. Nah, genomic sequencing shows original strain. Honestly, wtf elementary school teacher going walk job? jobs don’t pay enough risk death much do. Teachers deserve much trump party cronies criminals care making families richer cuts education keep coming ran online learning system University, seem understand system works. can't monitor filter kid showing porn whatever, that's possible. Zoom bombing happens password help often hard keep password secret shared whole bunch kids Zoom used. guess lucked came distance learning plans student side. 

To give bit background, school already looking distance learning options shit hit fan. winter caused us miss like 3 weeks month school, wanted look options pile days end year.

The plans accelerated along pandemic started schools shut forced distance learning.

Now detail distance learning plans.

The base requirements pretty simple. class assign enough work average student able finish 30 minuits resulting 3 4 hours work daily. 

That's it. requirements. teachers decide spent 30 minuits would them. resulted great diversity learning teaching styles. instance, one math teachers put 20 minuit videos detailing learning followed showing us couple practice problems. followed Google doc problems answer. 

In geography class essentially made done online activities did. teacher us research country choice located one specific region (Asia, Africa, South America, ECT.). Normally would presented presentations, instead turned graded. activities things like planning international trips things would done mostly online either way.

I would detail classes, can't really remember everything happened summer.

All say thankful school gave control teachers taught teachers, require teachers teach one way (Zoom). mean virus dormant imported meat got warmer came alive infected meat workers? real answer asia deal bird flu, swine flu, sars, lot pandemics never got western part world. pandemic went crap that's going here. 

I sure well multi-national multi-ethnic group inheritors hiring people act like want wear masks. conservatives incentive trim unwashed masses population numbers whenever can. post exhibits lack empathy. may aware, lack empathy identified root cause evil world. relevant quote may interest you.

“In work defendants (at Nuremberg Trials 1945-1949) searching nature evil think come close defining it. lack empathy. It’s one characteristic connects defendants, genuine incapacity feel fellow men.

Evil, think, absence empathy.”

The people caused catastrophic loss life WWII still among us today, causing trouble leading us one catastrophe another. people dangerous. way identify people wrong dangerous look lack empathy. always defining characteristic. article wonders harmless disease like Corona cause many fatalities anymore.

It would interesting know many people die. Things fine NY hospitals, due mismanagement every hospital completely overrun. hospitals low income areas heavily affected, hospitals weren't. field hospital saw like 14 patients bureaucratic nightmare get someone there, ended big waste money unfortunately. Crashed economy ruined livelihoods millions virtually risk reasonably healthy. 

Geniuses. Republicans enemy people. Full stop. That's hilarious, saw like first month accepted cause seemed like French thing do. 19th arrondissement ...lol?... financing this? bit suspicious.. Oh worry, US covered. School firing across America. That, flu season heels... epic battle. Absolutely disgusting push kids go back school... gonna go well. well enough, apparently. Florida still six months.

Hopefully Yeah, ""we're found sorts proof Putin trying mess election"" then, what, guess showing someone ELSE'S facebook feed? think seen Russian propaganda, could rather well disguised seen good bit already? Damn close. 186k currently. Gotta get wage slaves back work! Basically short stock vaccine they’ll paying 2x procedures Sad hear happened happy someone hand help. one faced sort danger part job, let alone teacher! Teacher here! 21 years. Multiple teaching awards. want quit every day. already week 5 remote learning tired admin backing us everything expected (besides actual job teaching)

Anyone need full time, hard worker Phoenix area? I’ve ever taught point, I’ll try anything. Lakh = 100,000 FYI Joke?

All troubles came ""Great"" Britain dipshit colonialism. can't fathom laws legal advertising get new members. 50% rule here, least somewhat understand idea there. can't get many teachers join district listen them. Ya know? sucks weak Florida, even way.

I intend get eventually. trying decide want do. wife stay, thing wants do. clue. never really actual incident. yeah, antibody test July came back negative -- although understand may gone then. You’re right course, she’d - it’d culturally/socially really hard. We’ve got another 6 days decide. I'm disagreeing you, one factor consider well testing widespread March/April, means actual numbers leading deaths hospitalizations much higher back then. reasons would go too, big part numbers start pandemic paint incomplete picture. Putting context, % Americans one preexisting conditions? care. Republican Party today same. 

Many could argue collapse would mean even worse problems. 

Not agreeing anything, playing devils advocate. hope start see real changes real soon. real fears what’s brewing next months. mean, ""trickle down"" decent theory, gotta swap ""money"" ""piss"" may seem like wild idea could quick Google search find FL reported 800k tests past two weeks. children school don’t matter? General strike. model takes account heterogeneity susceptibility. is, people susceptible infection either large number social interactions perhaps biological component grants resistance.

One imagine populations confined settings everyone interacts one frequently (prisons, crowded long term care facilities) thus relatively easy everyone get infected.

Other situations appropriate real life demonstrate much heterogeneity social interactions. instance, people living Boston rarely interact people living San Francisco. Locally, interact neighbor's parents instance, someone attends different university.

The previous model estimates HIT 60-70% explicitly assumes everyone interacts everyone else equally. is, someone NYC likely bump someone living Tampa neighbor across hallway. obviously true. realistic models take facts account arrive much lower herd immunity thresholds.

Finally, new models take account social, connected people tend get infected first. infected, either die become immune transmit virus longer. people removed transmission chain, becomes much harder virus spread. clue talking none norm school I've worked. actually illegal allow kid go bathroom I've never heard classroom allowing clear water bottles recent history you’re saying people investment lie?

I’m really hoping we’ve seen starkly, won’t able unsee it. Yeah general people money power treat everyone wonderfully. God bless Bill Rights. government force anything us. Authoritarian asswipes.

Brainwashed idiots believe virus deadly demand masks made mandatory even thou death rate far lower seasonal Flu death certificates manipulated said many physicians doctors.

The institutions maintain existing social economic structure interest individualizing issues instead pointing structural causes manifestations. institutions constantly refer sort “innate” evil, misguided, selfish, human behavior like humans pop womb nasty *their* law order fix it. narratives maintains status quo; status quo benefits political economic power.

Our minds connected matter. ideas shaped molded environment. hopelessness pushed onto us narratives found articles like must rejected. Education, constructive discussion, understanding majority world’s peoples common goals, knowledge always needed survive progress pushed instead. Imagine using term taqqiya unironically 2020. would happy tried shocked idiot 137 posts T_D also thinks best beer world american. Saudi Arabia, Qatar UAE known slaves Yea mean...they testing phase many vaccines right now, “development” really necessary point. that's case accept let natural selection job?

Let's start recent one biggest cluster came scumbag super spreader broke home quarantine coming back India.

Now majority cases listed today travellers India; hell flights India still allowed? cases getting control - flights banned prevent spread! wasn’t going engage changed mind. 

Teachers doctors. I’ve needed make appointments kids doctor multiple times since began haven’t office once. It’s always video call.

Doubt forever though see China? don't. CDC website. Like said key metric using gives us accurate picture terms containing testing virus.

You break find information. example, want figure well state testing deaths, give option show Covid vs non-Covid deaths. state many non-Covid deaths yearly average, excess Covid deaths. state show this, excess deaths Covid deaths measured, likely enough testing. English Europe's Americans. friend quit teaching (she great teacher advocate kids) working coffee shop manager.
She said makes money better benefits.
Says lot. throwing darts board pick number. muslims power money treating everyone else like total shit news. Also, like 7 day rolling average? Active case counts? think people missing point: still pass around virus symptoms present.

Kid likely passed virus others. someone thought smart idea open schools. I’m never stepping foot Florida. dude crazy! I'm even sure masks made underwear companies considered odd? fabric sewn together stretchy elastic. That's pretty much mask too. Makes sense they'd resources convert. many times tell low IQ people like ""herd immunity"" thing get virus again. wife’s retirement begins tomorrow 39 years school. Sad hang up, is. dealing Pre-k thru 3rd graders PE teacher. grown daughter we’re close contact often weak immune system. wasn’t worth risk. Proud walking away. would suggest people eat mask on? Plus, there's ample space tables I've seen, waiters wear masks. That's way country (without exploding case numbers) doing... 480BN remains commuter belt local economies instead sucked Big City.

Ok dude go school much money make coming out? employer didnt seem mind degree. Stop spreading wild theories. Remember everyone speculating virus spread india ""hot climate""? I’m staff, teacher, no. Thank goodness. Hong Kongers think DNA important enough lol. ""Uh, yeah, lived good long life"" 

What took great care wanted live 100??? situation Canary Islands, especially Gran Canaria somewhat also Tenerife, quickly getting worse throughout August. Quite detailed statistics available dashboard. head far ass see daylight. Try example, maybe empathy trees instead humans. 

Do know drip line trees? rule thumb many deciduous trees roots extend approximately distance branches. take need survive. Let's pretend waste barrel (resisting urges here) spilling toxins would flow trees drip line without measures taken. happens next? tree gets sick depending amount exposed may die. 

Now capable scaling different volumes toxicant mind levels tree likely die levels give better chance surviving, try apply logic mask use. difference without volitization toxicant example completely neutrilized threat. virus can't.

Save trees dude. Foreigner here: return permission process require negative test? Bill gates wants reimagine education know, install CDC chiefs teach em effective measures.

You know recourse point. public government take responsibility matter what. choice hot war gonna bomb Chinese ww3 revitalize economy.

I'm actually it, long win. 🙄 Fuck man. alone time? sacrificing lives speaking MASSIVE systemic issues. 

I’m sure paid lots attention educational funding slashed last 30ish years. Repeat me: “understanding advocating”. Understanding what’s going thing endorsing particular behavior, attempt disaster olympics. I'm going lie; thought quitting times distance learning started. stress understanding different learning platforms type parent support students would receive wearing mind night day. Distance learning started last week went way better thought would. Granted, lot work, feel provided stronger understanding challenges, needs, strengths one students families face. problem ozone generation everything stinks disinfection. matter long air afterwards. Using 80w uvc Tube. Orag Man Baaaaaad!!!

It's sad repealed precious SA sanctions imposed Obama. Oh wait. LOOL

What bunch morons

As expected HK colonial bootlickers Teachers educate children math science, can't understand virus spreads. amazing, really. I.....agree?.... People swim oceans chances getting eaten sharks 6%.

Imagine 1 200 people dying swimming oceans, 1 16 times person dies swimming oceans, due shark attacks. 

This considering covid19 spreads better melted butter. experience, no, generally normal course action United States. dont islam teach us inhumane That's good all, Darwin's thinking based racism sexism. Hello 80% nearly everywhere. Unfortunately always kind people every pandemic. Human nature, guess. know interaction yet flu shot covid vaccine? Consider one estimates almost half Americans least one comorbidity covid 19 percentage ramps quickly age increases. sure, 6% seems like dupe realize haven’t a) let things run rampant country yet isn’t dupe b) really struggled protecting long term care facilities c) let covid freely spread would see high, high numbers deaths long term complications adults poor American’s health general. Basically seems like dupe it’s not, fam. think coronavirus almost behind case numbers going up. know could faking numbers they're actually way higher says. China's corrupt surprised are. Think it, possible biggest country world barely getting cases? least million more. noble bastions idealism. love for-profit schools. trash article. confirms kid got infected school started. Egad, bad! Thanks catching that; I’ll edit 👍 get information? takes average 5 days get first symptoms. Another week hospitalized, death 2 weeks that. business world called **moral hazard.** think also apply everyday life. People superior complex untouchable hits them. please make rest world fall another 'masks take away freedom' 'testing takes away freedom' conspiracy. much.

Nor would make sense, testing VOLUNTARY (i.e. people apply get not....? Lol even worse one selfish uncaring folk boss officer company work for.

It's maddening put lightly looking elsewhere. prospective employer asks I'm looking, ""because handling covid"" answer, followed ""how folks handling covid.""

You go overboard, _nothing_ bare minimum federal stuff, arguing nuances law (trying absolute minimum) boggles mind. National health comission doubt ""most"" will. will, even then, hit chapter 11, restructure, back getting paying debt. ones actually go business, others spring and/or existing players move vacated spaces/markets.

Movie theaters still around over. oddly confusing worded title. Lol. crunching numbers head trying get add believe toxicity social media co-OP'ed movements things staying local, along globalization doubts. Suddenly buzz words making round French, Big Brothers, Sheep, things like that. hope raise French kids better heads shoulders. Republicans dont actually stand anything really care. worship power that's it. estimates referring, models attempt factor heterogeneity age distribution social activity level. read papers describing models authors state results taken estimates. 

Example: 
From abstract: estimates interpreted illustration population heterogeneity affects herd immunity rather exact value even best estimate. 

You find models PubMed. 

The seroprevalence measured non-clinical settings involves socially active members population, people either know SARS-CoV-2 thus immune lower risk developing severe cases disease. Even anecdotally sub see plenty people saying they're taking heavy precautions higher risk mortality, see lower risk taking fewer precautions. Additionally, look geographic distribution seroprevalence quickly see within states, within cities, ton spatial heterogeneity, meaning protection equally distributed area. 

What's goal herd immunity? many colleagues goal includes protecting vulnerable people contracting disease. Relying seroprevalence benchmark figure based disjointed serosurveillance achieve that, fact likely increase risk disease vulnerable populations. Which, actually, authors models acknowledge. dangerous high risk groups rely seropositivity declare herd immunity members go back associating others higher risk (i.e., elderly people gathering together) one becomes infected looking outbreak right there. President Orange say US bad India press Yeah understand. Kids hardly affected still forced home. Sweden NEVER locked schools seems approach herd immunity now. students come school putting anywhere 20 40 people room, 100+ halls every period.

Having teachers come school putting 1-2 people room, much Covid threat all. pretty much wear mask 11 hours day, situation could fairly safely go maskless in. 

It also positive centralizing teachers school system hopefully (if half-assing this) arrange internet speeds necessary stream learning several dozen teachers several hundred students once. also knowledgeable individuals hand (or tech savvy teachers) help system fails, teacher know adapt new system. Yea, believe it. Professors rampantly ignoring work, explaining entire research assignments blind sided us 2 day deadlines, random unannounced “required” discussion board posts, random “required” email response/submissions, essentially name it...... 

My school desperately trying pretend catastrophe didn’t even happen. Even people previously healthy would probably covid listed cause death. Things like reapiratory failure, cardiac arrest, etc. nobody talks virus, it'll go away. kind miracle look big picture. Somehow 200+ countries around world, different political ideologies religions, agreed work together trick common person pandemic happening. actually pretty amazing feat international coordination. Sounds interesting. Could please send link study? Welp. Here's another thing that's never coming back. way completely stop imported cases unless travel...but cannot continue live operate constant lockdown. day 169 2 weeks stop spread means needed start due minimal testing limited knowledge must move forward masks, contact tracing social distancing possible. wanted UK go herd immunity public outrage made U turn government seems moment, choose stupid option change minds obvious happens bag yet. live strange place. one 100 largest cities America, people even state point map. vote Republican every election, also passed every tax increase ballots 20 years I've here. Covid hit, impressed empty everywhere was, fee masked. summer hit, everyone went back work, hardly anyone masked. city issued mask mandate, everyone complies without much fuss. One lady nextdoor app tried get mask protest together throughly mocked outnumbered. never predict direction we're going Super misleading. Six ten Americans comorbidities like influenza, infected develop comorbidities. 

Regardless, taking account 5% mortality; 6% deaths perfectly healthy people, 0.3% mortality rate perfectly healthy people. pretty scary indeed. Oh can't declare essential workers guilt trip bully going back work die minimum wage. Shucks. similar protests germany right interresting part is, participants mix several ideologies. right wing protesters, neo-nazi groups called ""Reichsbürger"", believe germany legitimate country feel bound laws. also anti-vaxxers, conspiracy nuts kinds left wing people form government, well families children older people, necessarily think extreme political views. really strange crowd. 

So one thing people trying tell people is, look marching with, really identify people trying use protests agenda?

Yesterday one protest shut police, one wearing masks keeping distance. escalated like 200 people arrested. indications AASI genes worse covid outcomes.

Source?  300 million doses, 450 million EU citizens. Color impressed. It’s getting even less attention, CDC (once again) updates stats. 6% total cases truly attributed coronavirus deaths. rest comorbities, average least 2.5 underlying serious health duped fam... Super misleading. Six ten Americans comorbidities like influenza, infected develop comorbidities. 

Regardless, taking account 5% mortality; 6% deaths perfectly healthy people, 0.3% mortality rate perfectly healthy people. pretty scary indeed. Ok need help hope place post it. friend mine thinks masks harmful good. understand thinks lot misinformation there. thinks something sketchy going CDC said ""don't wear masks"" saying ""wear masks"". also thinks information counted valid coming quickly. 

I need help convincing something take seriously well masks beneficial information coming also true. (Links articles help DM comment here.) sensible person open information makes sense. (She also understand masks protect person wearing protect people) tried really hard I'm close need extra help! Thank much! I'm sorry allowed really could use help... China I've heard emergency use medical community military. medical community emergency use SinoVac companies vaccine military use CanSino Inc's vaccine. No, supply chain empty, enough new laptops. 

Even refurbished laptops scarce now. think companies regular updates. think everyone agree don’t pay teachers event remotely enough. Teachers have, arguably, important job world. spend time kids do. play huge roll shaping next generation. need pay value. context fuck lurk sub I'm convinced might never go away. that's case accept let natural selection job? like keep protecting ones can't survive forever, we? highly doubt virus going killing people remotely significant rate US even one year now, much less couple. know least 10,000 identifiable people need sectioned safety ours. way prove that? two schools situated right next other, one failing exam results poor one graded outstanding good exam results surely proves difference individual teachers make. 

When school improves failing outstanding quality teaching learning improved across school measurable observation surely shows difference quality teaching makes? 

In UK, also plenty private schools pay teachers far money charge parents fortune 'better' education (also facilities connections).

There's real problem retaining good teachers. like job, staff end 5 years experience less know going performing optimal level. TIL British people say fuck off. Hmm, it’s almost like Novartis, Mylan, Teva, bunch big pharmaceutical companies started ramp mass production decade’s old anti-parasitical back March; Authoritarian Agent Orange love affair it. efficacy drug COVID proven.

What companies meant now? Admit fast-tracking production hundreds millions hydroxychloriquine tablets March poor decision? No, clearly reality wrong, eventually enough studies we’ll find marginal impact treatment get rid darn pills. everyone commenting perplexed: it’s ok! Humanity needs cleanse gene pool stupidity. article nothing USA. Americans make everything themselves? told press shaking hands everyone met covid ward.... also refused apologise top advisor clearly breaking rules height lockdown. too. like wearing mask well probably continue pandemic ends. what? restrictions all, time, hints asymptomatic spread, widely understood. Everyone meeting acted normally. reason think couldn't. blamed? lol Maybe parents obtuse. Yes there's argument ""oh choice job"" schools would shut outbreak anyway point moot. mean, thats threat, powerful ""I'm striking""

State ""well we'll take license teach""

Teachers ""This important. Strike.""

State ""Fine. Revoked. youre teacher""

...

...

State ""Ok, kind need education. We'll agree demands.""

...

State ""Hello? Anybody left? ...Crap, think through."" can't count high. Thats true, I'm 26 feel like I'm beaten stick every day Right, increase salaries teachers, opt lighter workloads, reducing stress detrimental conditions.

There numerous ways improve education system, throwing money simplest that's many people happy solution. maverick scientist. selling snake oil. There’s convincing stupid...... I’m mRNA 1273 trial, getting second dose soon. researchers told may able see preliminary results within 3 months. housekeeper VA hospital Farley recently reasons. work goddamn hospital somehow wearing masks bullshit ""democratic hoax"" ""it's blown proportion, I'm going live fear."" much complaining nothing done choice quit. place outbreak waiting happen. Hope all.. Rather forgive fool learned mistakes turn another follow mistakes like manual. Tell dad get head examined -- it, ask ever he's suggesting voluntarily expose virus could kill you. Okay. bullets really fatal pre-existing underlying vital organs stuff. organs eventually failed anyway? 🤔 states require masters teachers keep licenses 5 years teaching. yea, many use “fast track” master’s programs easy less time consuming traditional ones, since also teaching full time getting degree reporting 10000 hoax yeah. couple different potential scenarios here, terrifying Corona way, way deadlier thought still massive amount population infect winter coming... I'm British/Welsh shit happening London everyone else know bunch idiots Hey tosspot, almost September post-summer spike registered even though nearly everyone back work almost two weeks now. bet top news-story watched news station, right? Nah even mention Fox - false outrage nonsense. duh

Is Chinese Health Mininster? Wow way I'll share see inside. Strictly opinion, course.

At least French crowd know par statistics. vaccinated fine, well unquestioning doctors. ped got angry bringing kids late (home schedule issues). one person circle absolute nutcase things conspiracy. sahd (stay home dad) yoga teacher. wife, even doubts leaning towards his, still got kids vaccinated doctors husband. far see, still respect doctors experts. 

I think huge amount suspicion anything non-organic, traditional way. modern wacko movements anti science stream caught waves aligned original pro farmers, pro local consumptions. Remember made news farmer dumped manure McDonald's? idea global food distribution always thorn culture.

If ask average French, sure, I'll get high percentage board sounding alarms full doubts. could mass production anything healthy? Vaccines doubts get borderline activists, yoga scene, anti GMO, pro ""bios"" (their organics), way government conspiracies, depends simple persons talk are. find other, grow doubts. .y MIL SIL like this. nice pies get huffy bio products. first get hooked idea manufacture products elsewhere likely safe default. think healthy doubt, hence answers surveys. Yet push come shove 1. cite evidence yet, 2. schools still require kids vaccinated able enroll, 3. doctors still prevail, far.

I get nervous social media toxic roll out. ways French bit behind anglosphere trends, good bad. Mostly bad. (But stuff harmless, like 90s music radio everywhere now.) Yep. tiny bit. wife (was?) teacher. also high risk get COVID. school starting re-open they've several positives now. time sanitize everyone back 24 hours later. carry passport Europe. Told call boss tell returning, packed shit came here. I'd rather deal starting 0 navigate pandemic beginnings civil war country give two shits about. Children carry noses 3 weeks per new research. yea including possibilities mentioned children may reseeded really slow, guys less testing. new CDC guidelines come mind. Wrong guess. China bully. They're trying take what's theirs. disputes India. (India-china border). They're occupying islands Philippines. Also trying Indonesia, Vietnam, Australia. Art here, idea; lung issue sounds scary please safe. necessarily Tory voters, they're conspiracy theorists. know staunch labour voter that's convinced tories using whole thing excuse get rid paper currency track everyone's spending. really gaslit people United States right now.....they defend world view end whether makes scientific sense not. told pwn fucking mods could post Damage control, scared kids fukin dumbasses.  Stop scared!  making lose faith inhumanity cuz can't think beyond fear. Indiana. Went visit family western side US everybody wearing mask airport except people gate waiting Indiana flight home. PEOPLE WHOLE AIRPORT. sad. Lol. funny. China bully. Sorry, still confused layman — point, think true reinfection nearly impossible?

Asking myself; (likely) Rona back Feb/Mar, last month blood test still showed antibodies. I’ve respecting social distancing requirements living less fearfully post-blood test. thought Karens ones claim covid hoax? many factions Karens? Nobody going work every day afford to. I'm essential worker. I'd like say I'm part country even economy; no, I'm risking exposure 40 hours week bills pay, I'm grateful able keep working pay them. ""hero"", huh? Education, government police crumbling away
 GG America. making comment following conversation Redditor wanted expand little. job roles teaching rigidly structured there's practically lateral movement. branching hierarchical movement, want move need masters specifically building administration.

Would nice, requires cinema. bank still operating (in year three). 150,000,000 people voted

I doubt 150 mil voted total, deffo orange fart. Ah another r/conspiracy idiot, guys ever get tired wrong day day out? tired brigading subs spread 55 IQ nonsense? I’m embarrassed entire sub obvious right wing shills Russian cyber ops. Better go drink bleach-HCQ-zinc mix stop Steve Jobs implanting microfiche covid vaccine make complete moron—oops late. Blocked repost. Belgium spring break week Stockholm. hard hit. Southern Sweden holiday week before, like Denmark. much less severely impacted. 

This one thing making hard compare countries based “similarity”. 

Look regions, countries. Look last year’s death numbers see many high risk dying. Look travel patterns China Northern Italy March see countries risk importing large outbreak. crossed mind day we'll never know Herman Cain epiphany would never let out. People fighting tooth nail get laws changed case. Serious question. emergency use mean millions injected it? really know think people wearing masks chin, covering nose. Like, know whole point cover orifices, right? sincerely wonder thought process like experience... unless they're spiteful.  movie theaters go bankrupt neue then, seems rather likely.  I've calling Kerensky since second closedown, mostly shocked pikachu face moment. I'm loss see outcome cases would dramatically increase opened businesses quickly did. response better Abbot's DeSantis's (low bar), change fact response incompetent thus far. clear know he's throwing things wall see works. 

That'd fine itself, also seems interest taking personal credit successes downplaying failures. consider great leadership spend half two hour press release talking economic accomplishments past. consider great leadership instead saying ""I messed reopened fast"" go ahead blame people acting irresponsibly. course people did- he's policymaker. understood that's people would do. I'm going pretend I've got oodles policymaking experience, bit have, me, principle want outcome people, admonish remand that- construct policy ensure it. Still deaths, wide margin. Yes exactly. time someone points lack deaths, always ""wait two weeks"". they've saying since May. HWAT? look great home.

Off Blu-ray, perhaps. Streamed, almost definitely rereleased next year safer go

Assuming cinemas still operational then. Time start working unregistered animagus. Nothing done, they’re quitting. Also, districts giving option stay remote-only, telling in-person learning they’ll lose teaching license. People allowed complain killed employer. agree protesters stupid 30%fatality rate suddenly coming from? side effects: patient may start purr spit hairballs Got link? Meaning, good pretty apparent happening. biggest fraud ever happen world. Reddit complicit think kids resilient people realize. fine end. It’s really difficult parents support systems completely collapse. months beginning saw nobody kids never left house except play outside. days tears would want visit grandma heart breaking explain couldn’t. (They went daycare since born everyday.) days absolutely crazy. Trying teach basement office two year old four year old running house damn near impossible.  

There eventually day look back talk memory. fuck retirement, university fired already. hope jackass catches it, i’ll accept regrets cdc website. searched saw fb post implyng cdc made update secretly. Saying dont wear masks anymore. someone explain me? Heres quote cdc. “For 6% deaths, COVID-19 cause mentioned. deaths conditions causes addition COVID-19, average, 2.6 additional conditions causes per death. number deaths condition cause shown deaths age groups” I’m going post lot detail today family member teacher telling got tiff principal concern safety regulations (or lack thereof) culminated meeting district office people union representative threatened termination. Sounds like it’s worked it’s ridiculous. Especially since, based numbers area, I’m pretty sure schools last two weeks in-person. adults living pay taxes work teachers train educate, government would pointless. course, they’re screwing enough stuff currently they’re pretty pointless anyway. drug can’t administered anally, orally, intravenous. kids expendable gop. Oh fuck’s sake stupid *is* guy?! Well, consider pneumonia, cardiac arrest, respiratory failure ""comorbidities."" think derive information table since death clearly counts multiple categories. Oh 750k monopoly money first USA confirmed actual reinfection considered potential re-emergence virus initial infection, samples sequenced. Ok good. remembering Biology properly. needed that. still hiding. legend status surely. largely arises ""good guy gun beats bad guy gun"" system thoughts. get better? think business professor would know X% country dying would worse slower economy short term &lt; X% dyomg. find interesting public fast throw teachers germ pit yet afraid enter subbing.... 


Source: scared apprehensive teacher LOL go strangers homes work every day essentially pretty much block imo, safe possible. I’m definitely participating less zoom classes. It’s annoying interrupt ask question instead able raise hand. kill parents teachers. I've noped out. gonna first year music teacher part time lateral entry start with. worth it. Ivermectin known anti-viral effect number single-stranded RNA viruses. In-vitro test ivermectin vs sars-cov-2 suggested worth try.  interesting references, including possible mechanisms action viruses. think issue comes ask district remote learning district says ""fine, want"" offer resources help teachers transition. 

Establishing whole system, method, routine takes LOT trial error. doubt districts spent time coming really interactive thought-out ways helping teachers teach. 

My son's school basically handed Chromebooks, gave students workbooks stuff, said ok watch zoom learn. I'm homeschooling I've never taught anything anyone taking lot trial error see works doesn't. pretty stressful. 

So can't imagine whole class kids freaking zoom lecture trying get learn work. 

There lot tools like Adobe meeting rooms, poll software, thing pen hand write digital whiteboard, etc. think thought prepared that. 

How completely revamp whole year's worth curriculum assignments perfecting years months?

For college classes differences quality online classes pretty pronounced professors already offered taught online classes years COVID professors start completely scratch. hard. paid put Covid-19 anyone dies hospital.""


Damn, people spreading conspiracy theory U.K. also? Seems tad desperate me. Covid: party me? shouldn’t have!!! oh yea think mention study too. one actually expects people smoke marijuana combat things. or...at least i'd hope anyway. right point someone might take wrong way actually try believe smoking would certainly make things worse either ARDS C-19 would feel poorly did. i'll edit post accordingly. many sentences still sources. Lame. course vaccine deemed safe effective multiple authorities get public health nuisance separate society.

Vaccines carefully vetted safe. Rushed vaccines, like rushed swine flu vaccine, higher risk. given example rushed vaccine turned cause permanent damage people. read source provided, believe true? Yes, definitely retire, fuck stick. literally get better pos virus gone. alone bruh. hate shit many people think going get infected continue spread it, unknowingly killing people process? No.

And late figure tourism based economy incredibly unsafe pandemic virus go together. No! idiots get infected, they'll spread good people. 20 min walk daily increases bodies bodies natural killer cells (they making vaccines increase this) . first line defense. Get immune system ready fight. Live streaming video conferencing two different things. Zoom fatigue real thing. many meetings it’s exhausting. can’t imagine kids every meeting. NOOOOOOPE. I’m 26 years old quit sub job year! “We might need longer assignments before, like teacher exposed quarantine”— crazy?? Triple pay I’ll it. Otherwise, you’re own. permission slide 2021 already someone visited India seen first hand amount pollution lack sanitation, wonder Indians stronger immune systems cope better virus infected?

One example stood literally seen stand sort food market COVERED flies. flies would scatter customer would come purchase eat food, land back left. normal there. one cared food bought ate approx 100 flies seconds ago. able willing help translations, please PM me. schedule going get lot busier next weeks help would appreciated.

DISCLAIMER: doctor healthcare practitioner, master's PhD. native German speaker either. translation conflicts anyone belonging groups mentioned above, please refer instead mine. Needless say, official translation comes out, please refer instead mine. simply medical student admires work Dr. Drosten colleagues, would like provide unofficial translations podcasts may helpful speak German. Alabama doesn’t anything right One *confirmed* six million. there's numerous cases reported re-sickening people there's way confirm reinfection. pretty difficult! Believe teachers giving fair shot hard position.

That said, would like, I’m sure ur district accepting subs! apply give shot? 

Can’t wait see building Minnesota last days. Allegedly due resolving reporting issue. really it. People thinking get casually passing someone standing near 10 secs missing point. ""four c's"" pretty much sums real risk factors. Back went great party school. went art program (and hopefully still is) top-notch. think mean normally, base death rate unrelated covid. get memo? sub wants favor locking everything down, wear masks even though work get number deaths 0. could admit idea talking sounded good moment?

It's fact schools becoming better academically profit awareness football teams. know publication used(they're joke imo), lets look undergrad. University Florida, 7th ranked public university commonly cited US News. widespread air conditioning, hardly anyone even lived state. little history build on. 7th highest ranked public university. think get without football? Fellow teacher here, want wish well. situation sounds frightening. hope improves. Wait till GOP rediscovers evil deficit spending gets Biden end social security Medicare 

Want see real depression? Take 20% population make beggars 
It would inspirational banks see Biden slam coffin lid new deal Longer actually. Hopefully, dark time evolve source light, providing larger platforms lower cost higher education people. 

It would nice society moved forward pandemic. 

World, meet Disease. ..Hmm. Yeah, evolve overcome. move forward. beat thing. win. Correction ""10,000 fucking idiots believe anything hear Facebook"" little late good chunk US Also interested learning teaching ur welcome sign ur district subbing!! need bachelors degree( means 4 years college!!) ur good go. since carefree covid I’m sure you’ll there! 

Looking forward ur progress caring teacher:) feel bad teachers right now, shouldn’t complaining two options. There’s good solution right now. complain there’s nothing done? would be? There's still vast majority population infected first time... Yup, percentage population easily deceived, fall conspiracy theories, believe whatever makes feel warm fuzzy instead facts 30%.

They used crazy idiots nobody ever listened recent political figures united them, several countries...often Russian support. countries suggests re-opening schools increase community transmission.


What evidence?


Children 12 school months. social lives limited parents chauffer around to. argument (which disagree with) would simply helping corporations best way help citizens. parent really sucks right now. 15 year old gets still sucks her. personally think HS years pretty meaningless long term would really sucked moment miss them. 

But feel bad toddler. can't anything, terrible storm blow town without power 10 days. said one night ""Hey buddy always like ok? bad year."" 

I know grasp it... wanted say anyway. went affordable state school option, recently significant personal life issues. currently work field studied halfway across country making good money. Wildly untrue university full idiots. local poor people maybe. mean, everyone Berks county suck ass, good state school. Sounds right ex local though people area usually fully there. scary many scared bc lost faith government would protect citizens rather push unsafe vaccine. That’s pretty amazing usually can’t even get kid carry school books car house! COVID isn’t tho Yeah totally comparable large countries land borders part last school year entire summer figure remote learning still.... specifically RNA necessarily whole virus, since one straight said RNA yet PCR test actually detects Wish could give year fully paid. Kids year behind. still is. I’m sure change heart (doubtful), least seems pulled head Trump’s ass long enough something people. think reservations rushing first vaccine effective. Actually said vaccine passes phase 3 found effective, even 50% effective, would recommend people get it. issue vaccines using Emergency Use Authorization fast tract unproven vaccine public use completion phase 3 clinical trials, something Trump wants elections something would set back COVID vaccine trials done. I’m gonna party sure! can't, wildest imagination, comprehend mental gymnastics needed reach conclusion virus fake. dead bodies. think people paid actors? families people paid actors? doctors nurses everyone medical field conspiracy? even understand conspiracy supposed be. make everyone wear mask reason? members Illuminati club going go ""ha! Made wear mask!"" can't fathom what's going people's heads. Pretty sure Alastair Cooke name villain one DND campaigns Heh. dunno. internets guess. Dan Aykroyd John Candy best! Quasi linear sound scary enough. though? We’ve consistently told early 2021 vaccine, earlier luck. give chance. Everyone freaking fringe cases noone mentioning this. doubting science learned 10 years ago. feel like going crazy.  can't remember, country burning 5G towers Alex Jones level crazy spreading Covid19? wear makeup! super spreaders everyone already it.

/taps-head every thread r/Coronavirus. Even still, speculation otherwise allowed. Imagine virus deadly need mental gymnastics prove deadliness may also 'pre symptomatic'. detectable symptoms many 'asymptomatic' symptoms yet. it! experienced smoking visited China ""experts"" said masks useless. Lots studies coming proving effectiveness double-layered cloth masks single-use ones. government literally lied people since rest countries around globe agreeing use would help situation. Yup. Literally one South Dakota uses masks.  came saw masks Fast forward next month 3,000 anti lockdown protesters die corona virus. 7,000 still think fake. pro-control woman, plain simple. California shows bazillion percent increase COVID19 cases despite keeping everything closed down. 

Of course since know anything statistic virus infection works. comment is: lets whine cuz info given, given preferred data set.

Are fuckin serious? upvoted you?

good gods!

People sick dying, insane rate, data sets!!

&lt;strike misread comment. I'm guessing implied /s address health insurance has. Even then, last unfortunately. Hawaii well good long even they've lost control. It’s like people assuming world isn’t steaming fast possible vaccine limit damage does. much effect US make education affordable people fall these. Wait... mean tell studied advanced theoretical mathematics bully people internet...? Welp. go. Schools open cases 18 go almost 0 20+% immediately. though kids spread thing? vis versa. leftover cold-war sentiments really regressive. issue daughter bad ear infections. Might sound dumb keep home over, runs fever 104 them. know they're really bad, somehow cause *no pain.*

I rolled eyes threw trash, gonna lie. live Florida. Send help Loser Yeah get flu shot lower death percentage.

Spanish flu iirc killed healthy people 20-40 age still fucking know why.

I told mother firmly take flu shot. care believe it. taking I'm dragging take it. straight told got flu + covid19 dying. saw statistic. work healthcare get email daily every work day. Same, happily sign Oxford vaccine shown work. really concerned negative effects read. Thats give two shits politics. strong political stance average japanese citizen would anti nukes  don’t know. Russia pays all. I’m following orders. think element decreased demand testing? less people getting infected exposed? see happened shakier? It’s dangerous sport regardless.  Every safety regulation written blood. cultural/legal changes expect monumental lots life. pass May wake now? NY got hit fucking March April. Social distancing even term outbreak started, CDC still telling public masks work. FL fraction population density NY, months head start prevent majority 11k deaths currently has. 

Anyways, are, exhausting trying defend literal scum Earth. Like said, anyone defends Florida and/or Ron DeSantis idiot like early pandemic, number Floridians took seriously stayed home.. proven happened prior inept governor anything.

Now, think mostly due large chains like Walmart forcing masks population part acquiesced.. mixed staggering numbers hard ignore.

Have worries though, governor conspired every turn force schools open, we'll teachers parents students dying, due sheer incompetence. 

I'd call menace, he's damn stupid even that.. he's terrible person who's unable process information given leaders medical industry.. sound familiar?

I doubt he'll run president senate years win.. he's complete pos. They’re also factually incorrect; UIUC testing, ISU college headline. big difference.

Down UIUC we’re actually pretty well. now, course. Time tell testing positivity rate on-campus testing locations 23.5% past week. worked lucky husband home situations.

Otherwise, we'd fired middle daughter lot issues end one year children's hospital lot within months. Pretty sure contributed getting laid off, actually.

Jobs understanding things, sucks.

Thankfully keep kids home they're sick. Wonder Canadian snowbirds going winter can't go Florona.   STONKS strongly encourage florida governor ron desantis shovel much festering dog shit mouth possibly I’m surprised don’t get press this. skeptical first, say far good. course real test keep semester, maybe. think major headcases made trip. Nice blend conspiracy nuts, reality deniers nazis. organised Corbyn's brother £10,000 worse rozzers nicked end. Wuhan death wish Chinese authorities let run amok learn history doomed watch rest people repeat it.  first 10 comprise Bill Rights, added once. Madison, et al, wanted ensure people understood zero significance order, none took precedence importance other. went hospital last week minor thing (heat stroke) super militant enter leave certain floors

I also thing detached unit a/c helped japan fight covid accident. Less aerosols unlike America central a/cs norm seems everyone gave trying stop pandemic want try save business expense employees's health lives. [Exercise May Boost Vaccine right? Never thought that. Hysterical agree that, English first language excuse since important topic.
Thank you, They're talking wrong college though. University Illinois massive testing, contact tracing places setup quarantine students. Illinois State University. That’s crazy almost 1/6 USA infections, New York still holding strong...

Too bad rest states didn’t listen New York voluntary lockdown extensive us states.

Literally makes sense. shut everything LA non essential. voluntarily *more* that? talking MC Escher painting going look back time, look like dumb people festered pandemic.

People learn nothing mistakes, usual. mistakes, I'm referring decades work health social services that's lost last 6 months 3rd world countries. invisible victims fear-induced paranoiac dystopia never register radar privilege. victims whose blood never see, wash hands, protected ivory tower. step brown people starving feet, always have. many young previously healthy people die, died, result economic fallout, virus, lockdown. 

*Fuck* em.

For progressive bullshit, world keeps spinning direction. Away people. Gee, must extremely tough go through. Hope stay safe, enjoy cake day! bars fucking closed Florida, walked job packed were. I'm dying fucking tip share. literally sad thought 6k daily deaths? read projection wrong? Nobody expecting MMR-type vaccine time, point, bulk community cautiously optimistic sufficiently efficacious vaccine based current data. rarely go outside. work working home, frankly never much life begin with. go shopping food week, maybe get fast food, beyond stay home. 

In fairness though, that's I'm allergic lot environmentally, easier stay inside. doubt sent known positive corona patients nursing homes either. Thank honest virtual school inferior. teachers best, effective way learn. wonder vaccine even matters point. people wont trust it. Achievement unlocked husband works local hospital, covid attendance really decreased last weeks. tbf, kind point stuff article, doubt people read article. need write clearly. Proof read submitting. posts absolute mess.  don’t think anything really closed. People still going out. Downtown Sacramento epicenter stupidity right now. report came saying 6% covid deaths healthy, non comorbidity patients. boils 9000 deaths 180k. like someone overweight, covid straw broke camel's back, attributing beinn overweiggt, even tho actually covid death. 

It came yesterday. I'm fairly (not trying get political) certain trumpism, cause CDC FDA mysteriously changed reporting getting pressure white house. Idk though. 

In short, no, covid alone killed 9k people. http://nbc25news.com/news/local/cdc-94-of-covid-19-deaths-had-underlying-medical-conditions

🥱🥱 Yeah yeah yeah many actually sick and/or died? half posts get removed, regardless source. Problem whole discussion COVID-19 politicised US, particularly strange someone like isn’t American. 

I certainly don’t remove posts based source alone. 

If think sub joke, here? propaganda article Hypertension, ~45% American adults have, preexisting condition. That's mention asthma (8%) diabetes (11%) too. 

And three common ones, without even accounting healthy people developing blood clots 30s young people recovered permanent lung scarring.

If want look even deeper, ""mysterious"" ~500% increase pneumonia deaths (non CoVid, officially) year concerning.  depends mean highly effective. seems premature assume anything level effectiveness. cares post misleading news, long owns conservitards  written utter nonsense. Try reorganize thoughts find analogy better aligns situation around coronavirus. Half accounts calling anything Twitter bots. Twitter full bots. Well things get serious - - expect nothing less complete utter collapse utopia notion scarcity, perceived benefits willingness pay cornerstones upon prosperity built.

Therein lies delusion.  highly effective. jury understanding scientists expecting highly effective vaccine first round candidates.

Edit: downvotes? literally quote Gottlieb. Watch video. That's said, opinion. think probably trying make joke, clear presence COVID wastewater means system person generated wastewater. words, it, poop it.

Wastewater detection incredibly effective way detect asymptomatic cases shortly reach peak contagion levels.

Edit: deleted comment joke wash hands wastewater, there's nothing worry about. understand saying. point simply this. know death rate covid-19 2-3 conditions, looking data later tell us much actually covid-19. theory like article says, acceleration death covid-19 show less deaths illness year next. getting difference avarage see true numbers. even make sense. 
Also shows much worse coronavirus people within certain age range. destroying economy, closing schools. Things like need end life needs go on. probably killing actual virus, mental health, loss jobs actual virus. They're order section amend. earlier would come original document, earlier put list. stay inside bro, wait potential years leaving house virus eradicated bro That's true.... see there? better that's sure. Still think dorms safe. No, comment gobbledygook. Non-native speaker I'm guessing. Hey, really close! Thank you, deeply un-nuanced title really bugging could easily misinterpreted made evident many comments. well documented COVID-19 causing major symptoms cause things Pneumonia/Cardiovascular problems. data set alone like well 150k+ people died either respiratory/pneumonia/cardiovascular issues.

If see another person say something stupid like 6% deaths COVID-19 I'm gonna actually start calling Russian agent trying sow discord. Even me, non-doctor critically think enough understand time actual virus kills you, **it's complications virus does.** used be, could go Infection2020 website see case numbers grew, state even county, since beginning pandemic. recently changed displays even ""all dates"" settings go back early June.

So track much COVID grown Texas since *we* reopened starting May 1st, go back find [this great heat created user daily early months pandemic, went radio-silent 3 months ago.

From DrHoatzin's map April 30th, Texas 27,390 cases Coronavirus. Infection2020 indicates yesterday, Aug. 29th, we're 632,292 cases. That's increase 23-fold, 2,200 percent, not-quite-4-months.

*so tired winning* really nice see country covered something positive. I'm proud passing mask legislation HAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH Get fuck feed Floridians right now: "" shoot it"" dangerously misleading based widespread disinformation campaign. Comorbidities include respiratory failure, pneumonia, cardiac arrest. know, things caused COVID. really means 6% incomplete death certificates listed COVID. Excess death stats anyone?  pandemic. conspiracy theories spice quiet lives desperation. It’s sad &amp; pathetic. seem reacting all. understand 6% percentage deaths close 200,000. Also 6 million cases US . .2% chance death calculated whole us gets infected. Also low chance since 1 103 chance dying car accident. ""If move decimal point number ain't look bad"" -- Florida Republicans, probably Thank changing mind. important able something like this. No, mean virus deadlier. PCR positive test still means someone infected; otherwise affect CFR IFR. Lol except didn’t, said exactly opposite wanted say told stop taco wear fucking mask. contrast dismal re-openings parts country. Hopefully keep up. basically saying correct approach? correct approach would testing faster paying attention viral load, which, number cycles, appears somewhat possible? Correct I'm wrong, giant fuck up? Even scientists article saying can't believe done. opinions matter meaningless continue listening monolithic SCIENCE organizations failed every turn rather people trenches, move varied skill sets represented WHO, Koch, CDC? US sitting around thumbs assess claiming nothing done real complicated issue great answers.

If describe major US issues, know does. list ""impossible solve"" problems seems major issue US every developed nation problem insane...

Healthcare, school shootings, guns general, Covid19 control, teaching pandemic.. top head I've awake 5 minutes  Why? mandatory? ☝️ Imagine 9/11 occured due uncontrollable forces nature mainly killed people late 70s 80s. zero cases shortly. want travel Los Angeles New York five minutes, can't regardless much cash urgent is.

Testing products efficacy takes time. woke! smh it? countries pretty strict lockdown reopened street cafes etc. Spain reopened night clubs current midst pretty aggressive spike. France reopened tourist attractions also experiencing aggressive spike. left recreation closed? Ahh, yes - single people, without mortgages dependants, don’t family insurance policies tied jobs, still legally parents insurance plan they’re 26....  could explain [Florida Department Health claims number COVID-19 cases schools great country wet market looking like petri dish

So weird Hillary working health plan Bill's presidency, insurance companies biggest contributor campaign funds Congress year. make sure relevant.

During Bush Jr. Years got bonanza Medicare part (drug coverage). Money power, use power ensure get.. money.. vicious cycle system.

Bush also greatly expanded Medicare advantage plans popular *healthy* retirees generous. got paid 140% Medicare would pay patient. Insane.

Obama admin kinda cut money Medicare advantage plans, ACH 80% medical expenses ratio helped bit (but cheated expenses, claim people working pre-authorization hotlines medical expenses example) 

All things arcane people understand insurance well enough follow. much life tldr limited time. That's ppl get away much bullshit ""developed"" anything.

They still working it.

Didn't learn count chickens hatch?

When vaccine November 3, sure come back remind post.  can't *eradicate* disease via natural infection. Herd immunity binary metric. Places like Sweden (and soon Florida) herd immunity extent deaths new cases dropping background noise.

If herd immunity, R0 would never drop exponential growth cases forever. don’t blame them. ppl aren’t taking seriously economy going toilet. He's bad Trump can't keep mouth shut! Look, it’s simple process. 

Step 1: Contact every child Florida ask coronavirus. 

Step 2: ???? 

Step 3: Profit. 

I think see Department Health needs hide numbers. need protect children nefarious plots this. disgusting person are. Despite this, can’t even land teaching job still. Fresh school doesn’t seem easy even get position. okay; that's still lot cheaper cost losing loved ones. Canada. also doesn’t track location uses app installed phones transmit unique code others prolonged contact with.  test positive report app, notifying others you’ve near issue. Annnnd cue lawsuits! might make zero scientific sense US, 330 million people, look New Zealand, country 5 million people

Can people stop repeating stupid BS? stupid Americans stop pretending like true? No, policies NZ TW nations PERFECTLY fine US.

Things like mask mandates, contact tracing, mandatory quarantine, etc doable US. Could people actually learn think critically throwing hands air justify laziness/incompetence? goes stupid healthcare system, stop pretending like there's realistic better alternative. Stop pretending like incompetent government never less corrupt efficient. Wtf wrong Americans? happened vision values? literally said wanted take stroll MFing moon freaking it. Get together, stop bunch weak demoralized whining p-ssies. Uhm? What? paid attention viral load stopped ignoring rapid pool testing though use acting though everyone behaving wait two weeks results, we'd much better position now. history eugenics wants word. empathy. going pull boot straps work harder! that's old definition learning I’m going assume fact every Intel agency group senators parties concluded “Russian thing” real conspiracy. size Trump sign inversely related size penis. I'd much impressed Wyoming Vermont hit 700,000 cases. (They 700,000 people).  sure another Bill Gates trick? mentioned better healthcare Sweden account lack coronavirus spread neglect masks lockdown. socially distant are. plastic screens 6 feet tape separating sit restaurants schools. Yeah, get that. suppose I'm wondering AMC upscaling areas essentially monopoly. horrible. You’re thinking backwards - computer use phones internet connection, doesn’t work direction. AKA: “Please come, state totally fucked, don’t income tax tax retirees pensions, need tourism money stay afloat”. Probably never. vaccine development almost completely stalled. I’ve teaching ~10 years *most* colleagues 2nd job least side hustle. rest wealthy husbands. It’s anecdotal, it’s reality. went head, I’ll whoooshhh That’s all, apps used tracking. Requiring medical professionals backlogs Doctor offices pharmacies delay people getting tested safely efficiently. I’m American I’m pretty sure doctor requirements pharmacy visits cost people much $5 test cost. key make test that’s accurate, quick, doesn’t need symptoms effective, administered non professional purchased without prescription. Sona Nanotech one game changing tests soon. Guy red wearing mask afraid showing one's face beliefs? Typical hypocrite!

To them, CoV hoax, right? ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ 

No 5G? Wrong protest!

All praise Karma! knowing Canadians help immigrating? live right next elementary recess, obvious teachers dont care kids getting corona. Im glad kid online learning year I’m fence truthfully. quitting, selling house moving in-laws. It’d insane change family insane things going on. anyone curious science side UV disinfecting, Ozone production etc

This dude engineer broke UVMask came goes wavelengths needed kill organisms, wavelengths produce ozone etc Russian conspiracy theory. E.g.  


You also look causes deaths year cdc.  


From post said: bump types death flu deaths time flu season, subtracted out, bet excess deaths would come closely current excess deaths. 

Have done math? Source please. simple grab thin air? unable convince people mask helpful “the virus tiny germs move”. I’m doctor can’t really come back anything lol. OMG this. neighbors block wide pizza party chalk art contest. kept kids inside prayed would hear commotion. Tbf, number tests don’t tell entire story. also need compare % positive. 5-4 ruling Trump. There's plenty disinformation China. government. Lol. quote article? 
 
the hypocrisy bunch bullies suddenly compassion another bully got called ‘karen’.... unbelievable honestly. given reason “insulted” wouldn’t wear mask. pandemic. Poor Karen. 🤦‍♂️ Let students visit thank UofAL administrators board directors personally. wipe hands anything.

Then students visit friends family.

To them, CoV hoax, right? ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ 

All praise Karma! I'm sure seeing Smashmouth totally worth it!!!! Rona Tide yup, Americans want admit makes failed quarantine crumbling job market failing economy hurt much must think okay, ""God's plan"" /s local school superintendent unexpectedly resigned first week school. Rumor enough shit. misread caption ""nurse save husband covid19"" ""nurse save husband form covid"" last 3.5 years already felt like never ending hangover. really want extend ? Note: sarcasm apologize getting it

You clearly idea learning/education works. don’t kids take textbooks home read them? needs teacher all??

Learning comes interaction experience, single teacher could provide 1,000 students time. tons data points towards better outcomes smaller classes experiences provided teacher/student interaction. 

The world would lot better everyone didn’t assume they’re expert something think so. last week Pakistani man telling family teachers highly revered position. said regardless age, would stand teacher walks room. wishes become teacher too. HRD instagram facebook PUMPING statistic saying hoax left trying make trump look bad. Thats aussie saying fucking morons  I'm poor white guy, wife never recived check all... us work make less 24k Feelgood ""student solves problem baffling scientists"" story, kudos trying, already well aware UVC huge downsides represents. I’d take chinese vaccine Finally! It’s always secret weapon 🦸‍♂️ 💩 Hm. Seems worked countries people actually give shit other. thought children resistant, wore masks distanced get sick. apparently none ever seen child remember *being* children (which furthers theory politicians ~~are lizard people~~ stupid). see scientists discover origin. pin blame origin open past future viruses originate country north America whole payment scheme. Sorry gonna support tax dollar.

Just like condoms, breathing choice masks.

And get started intravenous drug use still clamped another source HIV export lack scientific consensus efficacy masks. science deniers, scientists. you’re unsure believe, that’s problem. still going work March 18th, last day ""essential"". Many people similar situation. went basketball game Newark, record attendance March 4th 

At time, following much going on. still thinking reached US yet. Magic wands way better 😏😋 Yeah, paying tourst season, deaths holding steady now. country, age typical sick person went 73 34 example. get think reddit hive mind echo chamber bubble. told think waiting happen right prove smarter Imagine supporting Trump? Wow, surprised union would that. district heavily requiring participation. student misses many classes (without proper excuses easy attain) must come school parents assuring education found neglect. 20? one  MIL friend posted page MIL nurse breathing issues. told disrespectful posting stuff like nurses page.  Teachers incredibly important, ALWAYS undervalued underappreciated. anybody deserves colossal pay bump deal 20+ walking-Covid-receptacles day day out, it’s teachers. Forget COVID second, look thousands terrible things happening world daily basis.   
Most people cope ignoring going day day lives.  
So COVID comes along same. recovering alcoholics still alcoholics? Hmm... Almost like impact recovering extreme way leave aspect behind, create around beyond it. Contained, eradicate. Won’t able eradicate without vaccine. person part ex religious community angry bitter long time, advice him. Thank you! aware made another comment like this, recall effects WW1 flu taking toll people wanted life go back normal stopped caring. whoever got sick died, died, whoever survived, survived?  Please stop trying get people go gym. gym opening soon 10% capacity. would much like workout safely corner. Well yeah cause really cause extremism since centuries, current oil funded wahabbism big deal, it? uncommon start project thinking ""hey, everything goes absolutely perfectly we'll something show end August"" inevitably everything goes perfectly. disgusting! Greed worst evil. literally much money don’t know it. spewing ground. can’t treat people respect dignity. people cruel. Ah want someone get rid nasty virus inconvenience? soon Dem governor it, would become world’s biggest deal, way worse 180k dead. That’s way system works. fall folks! another trick Big Bicep. Instead, proposed “more nuanced” model assessing risk viral transmission relates four “C’s” (close, closed, crowded, continuous) whether face coverings worn. 

Is could done five “Cs”; close, closed, crowded, continuous, **coverings**? Good know we've come full circle terrified Russia again. long 3 years.... Canadian even make first decimal point number. hate dude, would hate something control over? literally indoctrinated religion ever since kid, exactly choice.

Also, post backed actual sources, absolutely misinformation. house Saud pure evil. hope removed power day. house Saud caused much damage world. hope removed power someday, wealth looted people Arabia returned them. true. Outdoor transmission low. asymptomatic symptoms can’t answer question parents? know I’m right this, due texts wouldn’t angry. Yes data presented without context. drop something something immediately replace there's void needs filled things get better. Maybe get stuck there, know Mormons Muslims, ex-mormon Identity takes long time unwind indoctrinated beliefs. find new community, identity, develop newfound perspective life, recover ways ""supposed"" behave drilled upbringing. hard enough getting ""ex"" stage. Regardless whether people agree choice surely people understand takes courage ""leave family"". idea air purifier actually make safer, long UVC light inside, harmful itself. Damn, traded Bernie Sanders Patrick Leahy Rick Scott. husband teacher. conservative school district decided distance learning spelled bluntly much liability would one teacher one student (with right parent) came serious illness Covid. no, can't sign waiver. 


The principal one school literally put yardsticks floor, desk desk desk, SHOW hybrid model good theory can't miracle physical social distance classrooms have. I'll butcher quote heard.

'Conservatism group receives special priveleges, group receives special restrictions. nothing &amp; nothing less, never been, anywhere' global website, like Facebook YouTube. Nobody cares country originally made in, ""belong"" Americans, Internet global.

Also, Americans ""vast majority"" Reddit, love acting like it, make slightly less half users.

If go country's major newspaper website check comments, people somehow still manage actually discuss country mentkoned article. Maybe because, unlike Americans, people actually basic education interest countries, instead thinking whole world revolves around nation. Weaponized disinformation courtesy Putin. crowd - size is. course should, it’s important remember problems America has, it’s better place live vast majority countries earth. first consideration stick ass?! Virus didn’t come wet market came lab, truth suppressed CCP we’re here. recognize improvement? Yeah, that's union.

If wage-slaved threat eventual eviction loss health insurance legally allowed strike, what's point union? well aware this. 

You person questioned.

 OP questioned specifically interpreting article wrong. I've thinking too. big step probably take lot longer whole thing made realize country probably going power long. people government turning pretty bad. WW2 great comparison. WW2 fought elsewhere. US population 140 million. 16 million soldiers war. bit 10% population went fight war. rest stayed home, (to large degree) unaffected war. people essentially trying sabotage war effort began trying keep us war keep us good terms Hitler. went war, people stayed home, much could do.

Now ""war"" that's taking place homeland. people want fight essentially giving shelter weapons ""enemy"" homeland. can't ignore people object ""war"", time actively sabotaging it. 5 year old made masks dolls. handling better many adults US. surely aware 200k well within top 5% earners, probably like top .5% fresh grads. feels like flex educated person aware situation typical.

to guy, university alabama fine. make much difference get degree from, cases. weird they're randomly attacking car drive much make. mean, finding UA grad drives rolls royce possible really prove anything either. seems like inappropriate attack school general bunch folks unhinged virus. nobody forcing US trials. FDA approve vaccines data countries. FDA going give EUA vaccine trials elsewhere, may think what's point starting trials now. can't really blame them

Victoria locking rest Australia might safer justifying violence police? lost guy. takes simple google search know islam religion treats everyone fairly matter religion. happened saudi arabia extremely islam, example terrible people terrible shit people. Nothing religion. Hate islam want guy, change facts tbh! DiE!

Better give possible lung damage chance spread kill staff city then! Yes, people stopped wearing masks longer necessity, ignored went away *pikachu face* Human rights abuses may degrees, addressed. Wow, well laid spoken argument.

Care actually make point? like isnt whole point masks flattening curve admitting everyone eventually get virus? it’s better hit once? genocide Fuck Saudi Arabia COURSE NOT. post full misinformation, hate lashing out. Man half people area even take virus seriously. precautions problem around I'd thankful people actively things dangerous. Large groups gathering buildings without kind PPE. Employees stores masks. look like idiot lol different things FDA allows disallows relates medicines food

Just curious, anything FDA review would protect ensure EU review case? Asked old right right today's got posted, posting again:

When everything started, wife insisted wiping groceries cleaning produce got delivered. I'm wondering, necessary? lot recorded transmission surfaces like mail, packages/jars grocery orders, there? surprisingly female world leaders often better world's severe restrictive lockdown starting late January, ended extremely effective. beaten covid. evidence secretly way cases China reported. Chinese people back living fully normal life, still lots cases, would result massive spread couldnt covered up. know actually cases saying. perspective gov't services, working home becomes norm, commercial real estate crash tax receipts, adding declining revenues income sales taxes. Gov't budgets going get hit hard. extremely disingenuous. Almost criminal. Yes, I'm going get Flu shot soon. get every year never get Flu (knock wood). rumors around nothing 100% confirmed, know young people symptom fever literally 1 day that’s test positive. 

Keep mind people it’s severe disease real fear mongering related COVID. people go office work everything falls apart. working fine.  migrant children going missing literal prisons, surely walked out, wrong here. Every single verse context, terms source, go find way accuse bias. Find version want, arabic english.

Who said God teddy bear? seen mother nature action disasters kill thousands people one swoop. even lion chopping head baby deer.

Why would think god, Abrahamic god perscribers hellfire one people teddy bear? whole universe chaotic full destrution.

You becoming people hate. like extremist muslims like demonize people like you. same. Personally I've loved working home. Certain parts economy (fuel, car repair, tolls, lunch restaurants, dry cleaning, etc) may lose money, workers save able spend elsewhere. There's reason force people keep old system up. grow new system improve people's work/life balance* environmental footprint time. 

*some people may like working home that's cool, choice would nice. Unless crime seen harming CCP, enforcement entirely local party administrators. 

If harmed, way profit illicit activity, simply continue allowing it.

Law enforcement China joke unless religious minority opinion. Countering misinformation attacking religion, one thing. Honestly hope find way compensate young people, especially college students, this. data across world pretty much shows negligible risk healthy people elderly/in nursing homes. many sacrificing futures few. It’s also lives lives eventually see suicides. 

Something would arguably extent social media didn’t exist. Something done help out. So, feel pushing agenda boosting voices large group people feel genetically inferior them? say someone also view genetically powers purposely crafted teaching profession one 'calling' 'special' teach. so, create culture martyrism teaching, attracting type people basically put kind bullshit. split pretty close 60/40 area, probably less liberal areas better benefits pay, that's enough teachers strike 'because kids' national strike straight fail.

If critical mass workers striking, it'll never work. Fuck that, effects public health, florida. piece shit. I'd imagine people little apprehensive last time everyone going ""look, going away lets get back business"". last time, mean whole time, including right now. Yeah. 51% staff votes unionize boom, union. 

My advice would contact largest union area see join them. article:

Significance Statement

This study demonstrates wide class epidemiological models adapted applications heterogeneous populations context COVID-19 epidemic. shown persistent heterogeneity, rather bursty short-term variations infection transmission responsible self-limiting epidemic dynamics.

Compact generalizations classical results herd immunity threshold final size epidemic derived. degree persistent heterogeneity estimated data real-life face-to-face contact networks, age variation susceptibility COVID-19.The estimate supported analysis empirical data epidemic NYC Chicago, well 50 US states. results suggest end first wave epidemic, hardest-hit areas, NYC, close heterogeneity-modified herd immunity, thereby limiting vulnerability potential second wave epidemic. Someone's triggered. Yeah, table data really poorly interpreted unfortunately.  first mistake people making adding causes subtracting total. footnote table states cannot patient could zero multiple factors part death certificate. can’t add values across causes. would need actual underlying patient data that. second issue table data known.  many people also diabetes never diagnosed?  people won’t diabetes cause listed data. simply cannot make statement 6% people comorbidities.  incorrect math follow statement healthy people even flawed.  It’s possible make statement based data. Ahh need wait 2 months we'll know everything virus? news 

Fuck shit disgusting. Emotional exploitation misery porn. Everybody clap boss's profits instead taking care other. unfortunate thing whole situation regardless happens kids getting FUCKED system. 
“By summer 1919, flu pandemic came end, infected either died developed immunity” .....as *lockdown* strains nations.... looks like something right slavery chapters history book. Sanction country thing migrant children US? many kids ""missing"" kid prisons now? virus ever dangerous healthy 19 year olds? There’s wide gap young peoples’ perception virus it’s actual threat health. wrong ad hominem attack? parents terrible right?

Considering reading Qur'an turned atheist, find irrelevant mention religions supposed monolithic commandments rules, humans deal understanding culture. literally thousands interpretations Islam religions.

I get it, literally claimed Islam monolithic Muslims practice differently across globe, say this, pick side dude, either Islam monolithic rules, people make rules go (like polytheistic religions even infer Muslims ridiculous motion, whole purpose logic dehumanize them. know comes dehumanization.

Reread everything said slowly, literally said Muslims same, follow monolithic rigid religion. economic migrants without access resources information have.

These guys often recruited ""labor agencies"" come work. get find really modern equivalent slaves. Hahahaa. job roles entirely changed, don’t time mess around trial error it’s working elsewhere!! I've got textile bag go grocery shoppin'. Good see stupid people everywhere, states. I'm American. Please mention area/region affects most. free post Reddit. Teachers life frustrated too. students dont hear weeks. parents, teachers. wife morgue manager, height deaths US 100% stacks bodies. refrigerated trucks 3 week backlog crematorium.

I guess aren’t piled sidewalk don’t count you? think society whole thinks that. Calling “political” idiotic

Bypassing US trial, given existence positive trials countries similar COVID strains demographics, reasonable 

This doctor disgruntled canceled trial HIS. Kids Yemen Africa eat too. thought can’t risk losing health insurance.

says really 200k could take months find out. money, problems. treat immigrant children badly. don’t treat “pretty much same” Saudi Arabia does. degrees bad. Dick measuring contest first. It’s scary fear mongering enough sub, clearly. political. can't admit tacitly admitting Trump right take seriously. ""early team""? go february exact ""early team"" bs. 

This time supposed investigate , want ""early team"" shit, 6 months via Skype. side gig. imagine full time Who’s going buy tablets? make sure every kid one? one makes multiple windows open. lot required programs use school won’t work tablets. exactly supposed type essay tablet? 

Also, teach kids need to. can’t see screen it’s hard walk need to. every kid different computer, don’t know what’s going tell exactly click. There’s much side zoom.  don’t even start “actually teach use it.” 

Like said, suggestion shows don’t know you’re talking about.

I mean seriously. “Give tablets” equivalent “let eat cake” level understanding issue Regardless whether it’s ‘outdated’ not, please stay away me. ....selling wild animals ""still"" ftfy (Cries foggy glasses able safely eat use mass transit - even driver's license, let alone car) propaganda 9 months in, many ""investigation teams"" visited wuhan? relevant post. Uhh ok then. Teachers paid 180 days year, time working 180 asked go 'voluntary' trainings attend relegate terrible teaching positions.

A masters degree average cost thousand easily; districts pay $2000 stipend per year Masters. yearly pay increases like $500 $650 best. supplemental pays stipends mention come tagged massive work hours, resulting pennies per hour times (Cheerleader coach example gets paid extra $1000 year, account football/basketball games/etc. attend literally pennies hour).

Administration really promotion, different field.

Officers duty working overtime area get paid $65 per hour. even contest gets paid more, opportunities promotions, pay increases. What, Saudi Arabia isn’t human rights utopia thought was? Murdering journalists, suppressing women’s rights disregarding human life? Don’t say it’s so. Good thing oil. People interacting Sturgis likely spread COVID.

Just people interacting daily basis likely contribute factors mortality kill higher numbers COVID. answering questions? easy straight forward questions. answer your's once, need actually answer mine believe demanding go there? show China completely transparent. show God yo world.

The inspection team arrived yet, know go Wuhan? sake going there? virus started there, go China Wuhan. meet New Zealand then?

Again, main investigation started yet. know go there?

Now answer questions.

To what?

What think pre investigation team wuhan?

Or want go sake going there?

And evidence think still around wont weeks china last 6 months whatever want? US. forced UN thing starting tomorrow. guys think everyone wearing masks, 6 ft still aggressively practiced? 

I still quarantine, always wear masks never go out. also watch lot youtubers seem problems going amusement parks restaurants. Eating friends. one virus yet. 

I can’t tell I’m strict myself. Lies! want us walking, running, biking past 5G towers infect us covid! /s Sorry. can't name 1. phase 3 failures: 14 effective, 1 safe, 7 neither safe effective. OK, maybe make 21, since one effective safe actually approved FDA restrictions. thanks 😊 [As 8/24 51% country did, higher Obama’s approval rating time Yep, 9 years I'm half latina shape, Russian troll. doesn’t mean Facebook thinks means.

If perfectly healthy heart, COVID causes fail, death certificate lists COVID heart failure co-occurring causes  really scapegoating person/party deserves blame? I'm less concerned safety vaccine concerned they'll rush something work well long. 

So say vaccine threat works 40% time keeps immune couple months. folks get back go work school, stop wearing masks, know back square one.  

And doubt rushed political purposes. care long term repercussions obvious. scenario happens, long got reelected, care tons people keep dropping dead. afraid getting sued. fearful catching COVID? No, really. Maybe - Im heavily asthmatic smoker. However, way look this:

1) symptoms pass someone else bad time it? I'd feel pretty bad that, wearing mask heavily reduces odds.

2) I've noticeably fewer colds year since back about, sure related, Im breathing less peoples colds train guess? - I'm continuing. 

3) mask takes literally 0 effort wear, cost less £10 several. Even benefits marginal, big deal, might well.

If wear mask minimal discomfort, I'd wager people can. Sometimes bad day need extra bang inhaler taking off, that's big deal. I'm yet hear compelling argument wearing one.

EDIT: Reason 4: also like look, theres too. That’s get entering country illegally. Don’t it. Oh India going Top next 2 weeks keep going up.
HOWEVER, Recovery rates super high, death rates low buying time India till / medicine comes.
It wild west survival fittest.
Don’t know future holds India particular makes confident EU stringent FDA? regards COVID vaccine, general? 

I surprised statement went a-sleuthing. Came upon 2016 paper - IMO, regulatory bodies equally stringent, though differences. October 22 date won’t work? really opinion. US serious obesity problem. Governors big ag states securing N95/KN95 masks migrant workers? find KN95/KF94 masks amazon ebay right now. hard states pull together buying power secure millions protective masks couple factories China. what’s number daily tests now? forgot post stat doesn’t fit narrative Dude great stuff. Please favour... another respondent OTT - id like hear thoughts.

If R(t) critical banging R(0) much? don’t get it. serious? drawing parallels America KSA. One divorce state religion religion constitution. last classroom didn’t windows all. excellent point! Thank you! presume know vote.

If teacher, perhaps able inference since said ""you all"" direct reference you. addition ""all"" makes 'you' sentence plural. One teacher position opens 3 high-school district average every 2 years... ONE

So shut fuck up. idea you’re talking about. banned travel Europe China, started task force brought Fauci on, else supposed do? seriously don’t understand people blaming president something responsibility governors state. Cuomo put elderly Covid nursing homes, yet don’t see anyone condemning him? Prepare downvotes. Even though said 100% spot on, won’t fit narrative Cuomo god. underestimate incompetence America’s response feeling headlines press ran never accurate quotes predictions. simply acknowledging fact people attended Sturgis contracted spread COVID Americans get sick die hard acknowledge? 180,000 Americans dead - COVID, last 6 months. fact people die preventable causes might allow conscience minimize unnecessary suffering deaths fellow Americans find tragic unacceptable. Good luck, wear mask wash hands. lost weight tried traveling outside state, might learn real trolls Oh, even mention went remote March, kindergartener came home one notices, **scarlett fever**. Like WTH, scarlett fever? hell parents thinking, sending kids school? 🤦 completely sidestepped everything said make redundant point know going age incredibly poorly. True, though teachers work 180 days year, instead 260 plus overtime. One biggest reasons wife went back masters teach elementary school significant time off. valued pay.

Teachers raise opportunities- board certifications, advanced degrees, districts higher supplements, mention yearly structured pay increases, counting teaching niche areas getting administration. peaceful beach protest. Excess deaths diagnosed covid listed reasons.

There deaths normal, even include covid diagnosis deaths.

It looks like lot additional deaths relate covid related issues,but enough data confirm that. reasonable explanation posited though. Wow, that's like 10 times time kinda talk, people need jobs money make thru. know work places gym? Tablets much easier children use since many already use them. intuitive use. I’ve done myself. also helps actually tech use them. unfortunate low opinion Americans. Yeah hope called police abuse worth catching Covid. Well maybe shouldn’t looting making unlawful assembly. 

Enjoy Covid wanna protest without mask like BLM spread shit go ahead blame biker rally lol  citizen. hope right. think could handle emotionally another round went March/April. almost 8 times average number deaths.

The thing rest country (not mention world) seems yet finished first wave, things still get much awful. Yup read it. interest reading it. simply question shitty headline someone answered me. got wanted situation. Overall, bad idea read headline. Look out, come comments random folks know nothing pharmaceuticals, biology, chemistry coming tell big deal. Main drive relative live operating system. like adding another user installing another hard drive. entirely sperate new windows installation. first windows partition bitlockered there's way second windows partition operating even know whether ""primary"". 

Imagine two separate computers. That's partiton would effectively be. way ""cheat"", would different running ""primary"" partition. want protect data, that's fine, research so, perfectly possible right. 

Save time talk IT. Thousands years old civilization, people top other, supposed do? Gotta eat. Obama built cages. net worth declined since he’s office. Russia collusion hoax (how still believe that?). acted faster Obama H1N1, more. don’t time educate you. Turn CNN educate yourself. don’t love guy, he’s demon believe is. Yup think overweight medically significant.


She’s going learn painful lesson life standards go way higher keeping distance, enjoying hobbies requiring meeting people wear piece cloth mouth means also think time Im leaving home

Been done that, masks mandatory everywhere turn back return home get one multiple times. Nothing beats sitting inside car front store dropping F bombs like crazy return get goddamn mask... speaking regulatory aspect. would like add something discussion regarding “the obvious reasons” please many americans comorbidity? forgetting country disgustingly obese Denmark exports pork medicine. surprise, pharmaceutical companies actually quite well pandemic. dare say fake news post, bot. 

All could done internet. reason go China go Wuhan establish conduct investigation. reasonable person, expects China completely transparent. proves percentage US population comorbidity? Conditions like asthma hypertension extremely common deaths older people even less likely comorbidities. anyways matter? don’t consider family expendable many us genetic kidney disorder.

Trump loves say report published ranked US best prepared nation pandemic, seems crazy given unaffordable healthcare extent ignorance polarization, main reason CDC. CDC lost much credibility this, ongoing testing disaster, EUAs hydroxychloroquine plasma political reasons. It’s sad. testing regime insane. know someone took test wait 2 weeks result. It’s essentially useless 1) provides absolutely information modifying behavior. don’t know positive supposed drastically altering life informing contacts? Furthermore don’t symptoms we’re contact someone tested positive? supposed act information 2 weeks? 2) standards say positive (by test) supposed wait 2 weeks symptoms subside long takes get test results. time you’ve probably already recovered end quarantine period. original comment U.S. needs drop Brazil EU bans simple, viral load. Large stores people wear masks outdoor events usually ok. Small spaces , restaurants, bars, gyms, classroom smaller space 20 mins more. safe cannot made sade long people it. new information technique methodology apparently:

"" mean don’t really see problem late email, it’s like can’t answered morning. believe tactic used local schools well; threat massive budget cuts (teacher layoffs) school closes due infection.

Parents already suggesting boycott testing since school can’t make mandatory. school isn’t given confirmation case drive on. I’m little surprised college crowd hasn’t gone route. want party scared virus - get tested?

We’re long haul. go there? show China completely transparent. show God yo world.

The sake going there? virus started there, go China Wuhan. meet New Zealand then? never imply anything, change tunes. clearly seeing things. said said, they're verifiable facts. plan investigation matter public record. advance team China make plans international investigation. investigation team even established yet. still waiting experts sign investigation team. investigation start Wuhan team ready. scope investigation whole world expected result years decades later. zero confusion unless hearing fake news. second statement. 9/11 occurs every two days regards cancer deaths US. 

that's poor comparison fair. 

Your talking terrorist event, caused directly humans killed 3000 people matter hours, also shook entire country's foundation. Every sensible citizen US, tenure world shock day. 

This virus pretty serious, deny that, control virus little different terrorism, I'm even implying one less serious other, place decide that. I'm saying two completely different scenarios share anything common aside needless death. I’d bet admin doesn’t show classroom would normal year. count one hand number times administrator observes teaching in-person normal year; idea there’s accountability commute school building teach online joke. [archive link anyone trouble accessing article Thank you. People keep blaming President Trump COVID spread conveniently forget came China. President Trump amazing reminds us every day calling China Virus never forget true enemy. egg face New York ramping up, telling everyone India going pop like country. like months finally kick gear, surprising say least. US Canada, eldercare workers work low wages, encourages get jobs multiple facilities.

That makes workers optimal superspreaders. One gets infected outside facility, nature job ensures lot residents staff work end getting infected.

Building design probably help. Many facilities common HVAC ducting among rooms. virus highly contagious airborne filtration inadequate, infected person could spreading throughout parts building even entered.

If Japan low case load first place, may matter luck; many opportunities spread infection vulnerable populations. extent luck, luck usually runs eventually. Yeah, everything bad Islam context right? 😂 I've got family ties though unfortunately/fortunately part problem I'm equally driven get away them. Still making happen pretty impossible right now. Hang we'll figure even end result problem half Darwining existence.

I wish dual citizenship somewhere! combination realistic mathematical models immunity real-world data place like NYC describe strongly indicate see second wave. outbreaks (particularly schools universities open) result epidemic growth larger population. Haha tablet would help. Even suggestion shows idea you’re talking about. Europe opened schools fine still cases. I’m saying should. I’m saying ban Indians colleges businesses, going fully online negative implications profit margins variety reasons. response well talk quietly don’t hug?

Transmission particles involves physics, they’re relevant considerations. true. Spain France obvious second waves. politicians selfish see opportunity pander votes.

The science pretty clear. Countries reopening without robust measures place seeing resurgence, like Europe state started reopen without robust testing tracing.

Countries locked stayed way much better shape, like Thailand. Oh hey america, gonna issue sanctions? reserved economic rivals? Reprehensible? course. 
But buddy said “a citizen” citizen. 

One least favorite thing Reddit situation AWFUL...but redditor (knowingly not) soups bit exaggeration two...then point out. It’s like “fuck baby killing Trump lover”...

Wait wut? Good! Yep. Test, trace, isolate works! Like Vietnam, New Zealand, Malaysia, South Korea, &amp;c.

It hopeless given who's charge be. Nah money going vaccine getting approval wether ready november Ironically efforts suppress infection spread effective, likely we’ll end less effective vaccine. “Spain/France hitting pre-lockdown levels, UK/Italy/Germany seeing cases climb.”


which we’ll see another surge starting october. brief intermission; quickly forget lull back may/june. winter coming I'm pediatrics, deal younger patients. deal hospitalized. 

I'm saying reports say disease mild younger population. maybe someone deals mainly people seek medical care otherwise mild disease bit trying argue correlation causation.

I think imply (sorry there's confusion I'm English). friend knew actually flue badly affect eyesight.

The flue cause horrific complications, also cause little true. get infected SARS-Cov2 **will** one symptoms 

You say much conviction, yet sources agree say. see:

 people become infected virus mild symptoms may know sick. Others get flu-like symptoms. patients — particularly adults 65 underlying medical conditions — develop severe form pneumonia, lead death. 

and 

 15.6% confirmed COVID‐19 patients asymptomatic. Nearly **half** patients symptoms detection time develop symptoms later. Children likely higher proportion asymptomatic infection adults 

and many many secondly, people able ride home they're contact doctors via telemedicine 

Most people infected contact doctors? saying 'Over 20 million people' (by cdc's June's estimates) us contacted doctors monitor treatment? think would bigger news case.  happens elections November, 100% chance approved due political pressure rather science. ""but people virus"" - probably it’s suspicious case rate drop low many daily deaths...   Many people supposed to/expected take part test actually did. Many opted out/declined. Really tell much. pray 2021 better year. It’s they’re testing more. /s Rolling vaccine quickly big logistics. Except critical industries (doctors, nurses) I'd imagine people access vaccine months. I'd like see *your* mental health would situation. Go work public pandemic learn empathy it, please. Sad, true. ""Green means go!"" would show evidence match shitty math? article clearly states it’s deadly deadlier spreads less better response mechanisms Fuck Saudi Arabia, rich oil drillers legion. guys treat migrant workers, Asians, Africans, name it, practically like slaves even forced give passports working there. recently start pass laws banning practice.

I ashamed. time right backdown bot. paid unlike you, know bedtime coming.  “My crime leaving country better life ..” 

I felt that. 💔 Start reading Guardian something want international coverage, change subreddits. NY Times usually back-page story least something shitty going internationally

Edit: Someone posted article un.news.org, looks like good source well like Palestinian leaders A-OK what’s happening Uyghurs. Ok brainer must TONS support, everything closed now? People protesting get everything closed immediately majority. lost want keep virus going. long affects larger cities (where Democrats live) rural areas, win GOP. nearly enough, expect access without getting approved first? where's evidence mortality rate going increase 16-50x? Floridans right now: Load previous save, fucked up! Unrelated comment: related This. people irresponsible running infected, people irresponsible responsible. Even means going restaurant one night week instead two, small adjustments add make difference. Oh didn’t know things can’t change Yeah that’s difficulty virus new. I’d say try avoid contact people don’t worry quite much someone hasn’t it. There’s much long you’re wearing mask (pref N95 foreign equivalent like KN95), washing hands etc you’re probably going get next months. 

I know sucks say don’t full data don’t full data. Unfortunately comment somehow long hard read. felt bored read all. think lot people might basing Moderna. Oxford Pfizer show really good results Moderna, FDA probably go route regardless data came countries. like Oxford simply based existing platform already working quite sometime. Regardless, political aspect touted many. Unfortunate coincides around election year. watch Pfizer. it? frustrated want kids back school person remotely, concerned person risk children returning??

I know teachers good work, everyone tough time work right now.. job 100% safe, ridiculous misconception teachers working flat false. train engineers, roadwork maintenance men etc working flat out, furlough throughout this? 

These people begging paid wages sitting home blaming everything sun don’t work grinding. Lol, I'm banned argument holds merit. fuck hole, troll keep circlejerking there. No, causes inflamation heart muscle - something specific partocular virus - rest, otherwise risk permanent damage. Calling vascular type virus [known guy tell COVID mortality rates lower everyone's gotten yet. People even know word ""rate"" means try LARP experts tell everyone sky falling.

I think username sums subreddit pretty well. Considering Florida currently one 8 states isn’t going follow CDC’s “revised” testing guidelines, don’t know much weight statements like anymore. huge fan DeSantis all, Florida testing lot. Except not. 🤨 latest (purportedly CDC) ***misinformation*** campaign circulating factoid 6% deaths list Covid cause. 

As medical professional upthread pointed out, 6% death certificates filled incorrectly data entry errors ***no virus cause death***: rather, virus causes things happen body cause death (organ failure, pneumonia, sepsis, stroke, etc.) huge number people SA basically use African Americans slaves (i.e. live-in maids permitted go outside alone access passport). Saudi Arabian friend racist great guy, plenty examples sure, make mistake modern-day slavery SA households culture. can’t speak specifically residential universities highly dependent profit housing, food, on-campus fees. Since one built budget “what physically closed X weeks (or whole semester)” income stream fundamental operating budget.

Check thread insider perspective chance : states infected people infected New Jersey?

Let's assume beaches fact problematic NJ. beach goers primarily NJ, NY, PA residents. NJ NY significant outbreaks since opening. someone recieved infection NJ beaches, expect see sizable one well? 

I'm talking country literally talking one specific state.

Viruses expontnetial curves, logistic curves change slope carrying capacity time respect different factors.

A state ""having control"" means leadership people appropriately act time acceleration period begin. really disservice call reinfection. different strain. get exact strain twice. happens colds flu too. means even immune remember immune strain, strains coronavirus. masking still necessary government treats them, family? Positivity rate also dropped, well hospitalizations. you’re concerned testing numbers, hopefully you’ll criticize California drop testing well.

And “reckless” push reopens school similar NY/NJ. I’m glad we’re back “jUSt wAiT tHReE WeEKs” Florida lol mexico 3rd deaths rising 1k day Either answer questions stop harassing me. asked long time ago refuse answer them. Likely realizing pointless demands really are, ashamed admit it, keep trying turn things around change subject.

The main investigation started yet. know go there?

And evidence think still around wont weeks china last 6 months whatever want? flu shot since child, flu 10 years, year definitely getting shot! think journalist still makes bold reprehensible. thinking public intellectuals philosophers, everyday schoolteachers. testing = cases

Water wet. Totally unforeseen... Came nowhere blindsided them.. -13 downvotes (as now) comment saying won’t wearing masks rest lives. sub somehow still manages surprise me. meant exposed people it. know contagiousness occurs quickly exposure. I'd take could. point being? would mortality rate go up? measured resolved cases, general population. Ok, let’s take driving privileges away 14 days..erm 30 days...actually six months indefinitely. Oh shit, cars rusted - guess we’ll never go back. 🤷‍♀️ Next time come discussion mid way trying act like white knight knows talking about, prepared. look foolish lot egg face. forcing people work know. 

And dragging dangerous phases pandemic things dangerous one cormirbidities job. care economic wellbeing? economic wellbeing businesses?

Getting virus control point pooled testing feasible, could safely reopening much right now. 

It would require selfish people like make sacrifices greater good put gyms non essentials, obnoxious. 

They nonessential dude. seen lack gyms navy still stayed shape physical fitness tests. People watch work maintain healthy level even non essentials pure luxuries cannot closed long without riots. 

Right, people like start access luxuries. minority level selfishness willingness violence benefit.

That's opinion, tell percentage non compliance society tolerates. second bars opened flooded, seem like society scared willing give things long time protect second bars opened flooded, seem like society scared willing give things long time protect people?

It take many dipshits town 30,000 fill bar 50 stools dude. loudest assholes necessarily majority. Like central american migrants US’s hellish covid detention centers? genuinely understand think point making pandemic would  really reinfection. infection 2 different strains. get reinfected strain, immunity working. got really unlucky. evidence saudi arabia BBC FOX news derived stupid americans starts points fingers. 

One question?!  many u kill japan nuked them?! always thought 6 feet laughable well think people knew well, definitely going stop meeting everyone. know I? Lmfao. funny  spotted fatass agenda appears stoking conspiracy theories? moron. One school district indicative school districts across country. know we’re done Covid right  largest dairy operations world. middle freaking desert. We've already several cases related Rpublican National Convention Charlotte last week, even though party attendance activities scaled down. Sadly, probably follow. doubt following state guidelines masks social distancing behind closed doors. would know.  rammed vaccine practically none standard testing chief executive figuratively holding gun heads. Oh, company manufacturing leading candidate never produced anything previously compared Theranos.

Half country doesn’t believe virus real, half already regards vaccine snake oil. Who, exactly, expect take this? Less people dying unrelated causes 1910s mean death today somehow counts more. That's ridiculous.

Fact matter is, like article says, USA's 0.05% mortality rate highest world - rate still dropping constantly. Spanish Flu mortality rate 2.5%, **50x** that. COVID mortality rate entire world even lower, let's say that's better medicine. would mortality rate **every single person** went hospital died(which even remotely case even back 1918)? [According CDC, hospitalisation rate 158.6 per 100,000, even ridiculously generous scenario, mortality rate still 0.1568%. Still **16x** lower Spanish Flu.

So even every single hospitalised person died, even case 1918 healthcare, mortality rate would still 16x lower. Objectively significantly less deadly. Ha fake news much yeah people totally openly sell buy slaves Saudi like America pre civil war. Dude don’t believe everything read internet. isn’t slavery, woman’s rights improving everyday past 2 years since MBS came power younger generation saudis open minded people speaking I'm surprised 

Why? people hypocrites. They'll go hoax, get sniffles, bet they're first line testing station. suggesting US’s close ties kingdom Saud prioritizing strategic alliance profitable trade relationship human rights? doesn’t *sound* right... 

(Please tell don’t need add /s) three two closer age, one not. worry Can’t afford Theres already likely 300,000 dead.

And let ask this. like push narrative TV 10x number people reported. means 70 million people usa it. population 350 million, thats 1 5.

Have 1 5 people know covid? Nope. Its. A. Propoganda. Campaign.

The virus deadly theyre saying. Welp Jeez, sounds like U stole VEISHEA added nihilism it. funding kind. poorer sections society get dramatically subsidized food, limit increased extended. Could afford literally nothing else. Almost like type people arguing it, usually go outside get invited anywhere fun. Wait overwhelming hospitals doesn’t affect death rate? smart Saudi Arabia country religion race. honestly stupid making comment fat shaming.

That would say Crazytown. 788 posts T_D totally unsure stage remote education inferior, long support home. Lack socializing main concern.

Unfortunately many parents cannot time means provide support hurt. Obesity pre-existing condition tho Totally agree you; even states like currently good control, wish wouldn’t risk it. 

Thank God don’t kids, though also job that’s always “WFH” opinion outsider’s. 

I surprised Dr Fauci said okay f2f k-12 virus well-controlled. mostly meant obvious example bad reopening policy. specific commentary France. See Florida die Yes even insignificant amounts virus primes immune system. 

Again, get contact tracing that's bad/pointless/waste resources. bigger picture, good thing. understand death rate nothing amount people right? Like 10 million Americans get vs 1 million Americans get that's going mean change death rate. percentage whole number. Red staters gonna suck schlongs oligarchs matter what. Schools hybrid learning keep schools less crowded allow social distancing. A/B schedules schools 50% occupancy. cdc updated actual deaths reporting 94% deaths already underlying health unconditions? Well walking neighborhood boring. I've done ton. want go somewhere new. guess go park stay away others that's okay. We're haggling standards relevant friend. Drop double standard spin. think standards relevant state human would want live wanted stay healthy. I'd take state gets control faster keeps control months afterwards sign uptick. Yeah, data lists conditions would classify ""pre- existing"" possibly caused virus.

Two points find interesting: (1) Diabetes seems worst pre-existing condition have, hypertension obesity. (2) ""Influenza pneumonia"" super, super bad have. wish separated influenza specifically, boy I'm getting flu shot year sure. Anything indoors lots close talking ideal aerosol transmission. Pretty much anything Covid 19 dangerous combination. anti researchers say solution test less, skip testing people without symptoms, recently suggested Centers Disease Control new data underscore the need widespread use rapid tests, even less sensitive.

From article article trying spin anti-intelectual anti-science flare. Thanks catching that. went searching guess lost track specifically asked. yes,he asked one, still fulfill that. I’m 23 2 kids, insurance tied husbands job. 25 party animal idiots. Probably aren’t. fat shame. part problem America. Many people live food deserts various reasons cannot balance caloric intake. It’s developed immunity. suggests tens thousands people who’ve given positive tests results viral loads low reach level defined infection. also means one govt - President Trump, Tony Fauci - bothered set uniform standard threshold - so, instance, could level virus positive Arizona negative New Mexico.

It also means lot resources - testing contact tracing - wasted people sick. Babe. see whole message board. “PHackersReunite4” posted exact thing 32 minutes ago, commented it, 31 minutes ago posted different title. don’t think you’re super sleuth think are.

I known information long time. CDC trying hide it, successful hiding you. every one pillars rules need followed, even one Faith requires admit God Allah, Mohammad central messenger God.

Anyone rejects Shahada automatically Muslim. That's like Christian saying ""God exist"", Buddhist saying ""Desire ruling deity omnipotent omnipresent five fundamental pillars; Prayer, Ramadan, Zakat, Hajj, Faith.

You're listing tenets religion saying Islam monolithic. Like, even mean? 

1. Muslims practice Islam way? said may monolithic

2. Islamic institutions rigid? global mosque majority practitioners belong too, unlike say Roman Catholicism like billion members explicitly belonging one, holy, catholic apostolic church. Muslim community much decentralised aspects governing body, ""supreme council imams"", Holy See.
3. practice religion rigid? history Islam one constant change, adaptation, innovation (a loaded word!). split Sunni Shia (which occurred, like, second Muhammad died), schools jurisprudence veneration saints, mention different ways Islam practiced different cultures intermingles nationality/ethnicity (eg. Hui Muslims Gansu/Ningxia vs. Uyghur Muslims Xinjiang/East Turkestan vs. Palestinian Muslims Gaza vs. Turkish Muslims Istanbul). mean, Wahhabism (a small sect Islam) rejection perceived ""innovation"" Islam (which ironic practice Islam never standardised since *inception*). Wahhabism be, like, thing, requires innovation exists, no?
4. Qur'an unchanging? course unchanging. written millennium half ago, ink parchment can't morph new words. that's case, every religion whose tenets ever written anywhere ""monolithic"": Christianity, Buddhism, Taoism, Sikhism, Islam, Judaism, name it. ""non-monolithic"" religions would animist folk religions, perhaps edge cases Hinduism (the Bhagavad Gita) Ancient Greek religion (Homer's Iliad) definitive scriptures fact semi-authoritative ""inspired works"". hospitals overflowing yet? Right around time Wuhan lockdown, Chinese relatives Shanghai went Portugal vacation. mom telling come US safe, refused mom crying stuff thought would die.

In April sent us masks lol.  Hey, interesting points. Luther nailed 95 points door 92 anyway, suffering difficult period everyone. introverted WFH, say party right oblivious lot happened thus far rate...
If want look historically say 1960s complaining usually got executed persecuted law.

Anyway going back historical points.
I studied protestant reformation go much might bore enough say although impetus behind points nailed door may appear corruption, schism due ""complaining"" many theoretical reasons Protestant reformation, one transfer power Rome individual states. introduce dynamic ""complaining"" may beg differ one..

 view French revolution ""complaining"". famous expression resounds causes French Revolution ""Let eat cake""... depends viewpoint. says complaining lot got French where. took direct action. want assimilate food riots combined revolutionary theory aided new development printing press ""complaining"" maybe could shoe horn one there...

Similarly throw colonial Empire Americas stretch limits use word ""complaining"" American forces well armed arguably intelligent millitant commanders. complain British America

I going Slavery one see relevant. Slaves unable complain anyway. dont see good complain gun head? abolition slavery accredited many historians reliant changing fortunes northern forces civil war ie tactical decision aided north tricky time. really dont see abolitionists ""complainers"" either. opinion moral matters make person automatically ""complainer"". would argue slavery ended economic shifts America made system less profitable era labour needed north factories. ie slavery capitalism good bedfellows. think slavery States ended abolitionists nice people bit study.

Hitler? personal level get things done complaining due certain fear factor perhaps? really stretch try suggest 7 million jews died Hitler complainer

I agree lot say examples fall short...

In brief - complaining always equate saying shouts loudest gets best result - maybe day age view grandfather thinks death count inflated hospitals listing *everyone* who's dying COVID case get funding/undermine Trump. countries closed recreational stuff contained ARDS would considered clinical manifestation covid, correct. Covid cause infection, say people die covid, actually die laundry list ways infection harmed body. there's enormous difference good theater (say, someplace shows foreign films strong programming general, probably also serves beer wine) shitty megaplex. Okay wasn’t citizen op said US citizen. journalist =\= citizen. post article purposefully trying spin another article?

Why post actual article instead article article interested e science way spun? possible hit herd immunity vaccine out, especially threshold really ~20%. seen weakness, that's idea strength: hating weakness. Remember CDC reported. 6% deaths Covid19 alone. huge scam. worry cash discontinued. curious think worry it.

I used cash years causing problems van think of. Everything done card online even paying back friends easier online. scientific article takes political stance within first 4 words biased. Biased material shouldn’t spread. irresponsible write article, understandable. It’s irresponsible less forgivable spread around truth. Yep, healthcare workers access services provide least. sad truth matter literally person test, dont insurance fucked. Basically dying moment, waste everyones time going ER. decent (which hope continues improves), can't bring back preventable deaths they've already had. countries ~~were~~ ""good friends with"", country least respect human life. easy find news torturing abusing (sexual, physical, mental) hired help.

The culture Saudi's rate swine book. least pigs try chill. Get high horse. pay well since they're apparently essential? 

The public's true colors shown through, March ""Oh teachers amazing realize little Johnny Susie home 24/7 driving fucking wall"" ""Fuck selfish pricks unwilling die get rid kid six hours day."" People like reason teachers quitting. One interesting would-be-funny-if-it-wasn't-real stories come Iowa City specifically UofI students reacted this. university policy allowing refunds housing 5 weeks school widely theorized (by students, could wrong) University going attempt hold in-person teaching refund policy kicks immediately kick students, keep money, go online. result this, students developed live let die attitude begun party *way* normal going leave anyway. University already reputation party campus, refund policy, debauchery basically exploded. I've seen people flipping cars ripping beer bongs yards everyone see them. Crazy shit. think issue places already seeing *some* effects heard immunity. Queens, London, Manaus, New Delhi probably lots little communities general. add even smallish amount vaccines looking pretty normal. 

On hand, places managed virus well large outbreaks probably need wait huge amount vaccine. 

So New York? Maybe January. New Zealand even Canada? Maybe March April. actually, cleaning getting ready leave, employees golf cart came asked us start car make sure started. EU health commission stated ""UVC exposure unlikely cause acute long-term damage skin cause severe acute damage eye permitted tanning device.” “Exposure limit value UV (180-400nm) 30 J/m2 (= daily value 8h)”

 think republicans don’t try downplaying numbers? want keep pushing natural origin narrative. one people wears mask area disease fatality rate influenza?

40s - roughly 1 1000

60s - roughly 1 100

80s - roughly 1 10

If risk profile like another influenza scared shutting societies? feel like victims instantaneous social media overreacted this. think you’re missing spirit thing bud. need take burden vulnerable, beach isn’t place require force it. example- 

Yesterday twins’ birthday. lieu standard house party met early park. folks (higher risk group) stayed masked upwind. rest us got enjoy reasonable visit one another mask-less spread out. Conversations held step back greater normal. known group people trust exercising increased caution places count, risk happy take, reasonably. 

We’re also state hasn’t done NYC many don’t public-facing jobs. ones higher exposure possibilities stayed step back well. 

I’m wearing mask riskier places. I’m wearing mask public sanitizing hands right things counts. I’m ensure park day kids family feel bad it. splash pad compromise much smaller slip-n-slide. park compromise backyard. limited cupcake event didn’t include blowing candles compromise standard family bbq hangout we’d otherwise. 

Find ways same. think life put pause since lockdown. girlfriend different country we’ve unable see since January visiting see family 2 weeks.

Now uncertainty travel bans lifted. seems like Trump genuinely trying add travel bans wants look tough. truly makes feel sad hopeless. Also tens thousands infected serve lessons people pay attention something happens personally. Biohazard suits bunkers! Shoot anyone spotted roads without permit! Rawrrr! /s never got see force awakens 70mm. thought FDA health org US though, China. friend's fiance trying get US India finally get married. come COVID struck up. feel bad him, he's hopeful months work soon things India seem getting worse, better, think he's going make US while. sounds like outside home four times less. go take walk outside woods, can't get there, three am. mention August miserable time clicked privacy policy link page form button close it.

DeathSentence  also US facilities love keep people part time give benefits would required give full time employees take multiple jobs survive thereby increase chance spreading anything contagious

Employees Work Multiple Nursing Homes Spread working paper, researchers estimate workers incentive stay put one facility, outbreaks nursing homes could reduced estimated 44%. would obviously impact alarming death toll nursing homes. CMS reports 30% nursing home residents New Jersey, Connecticut Massachusetts contracted virus late June, nearly 10% nursing home residents states culprit system effectively encourages (if outright forces) workers shuffle among multiple facilities. Many nursing homes rely staffing services deliver workers just-in-time/just-as-needed basis, rather directly hire full-time staff. median hourly pay rate $14.25, making living wage require patching together work multiple facilities.** Even then, essential work nurses’ aides orderlies skilled nursing facilities provides median salary $30,000, according Bureau Labor researchers found 7% individuals entered one facility also showed inside another facility. average, found, one facility connected 14 traveling worker. rural settings (Montana Vermont, example) cross-facility job hopping far muted, smartphone showing fewer two facilities. Florida, Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey Texas, single smart phone pinging average 20 researchers’ analysis estimates expected COVID-19 cases highly connected facility within state 190% higher expected outbreak least-connected facility. There's segment population hates change, actively *loathe* adaptability. They've never forced situations life they've suffer inconvenience, can't adapt save lives (quite literally, COVID thing.)

When see people wearing masks, lash call sheep, etc. ridicule see people threat. eyes, ones wear masks adapt actively pushing forward encouraging change they're lashing against, must ridiculed torn down. always way people. 

You actively work tear something perceive threat. Imagine realizing stealth-edited last 24 hours TV tells notice  Fuck Saudi Arabia. COVID cause failure multiple organs (including heart), lungs. I'm sure likely get point without pneumonia first. know didn’t come wet market. wet market origin theory debunked way back February:  well worrying, nearly million people died needlessly millions left severe organ damage we're still basing numbers complete, unfounded guess ""mostly over"". gamble life, right gamble anyone elses. returning schools world apocolypse hasnt happened yet.

how's going america though lmao. talk weeks. Took long enough figure out... attend US college 25k undergrad/grad students. outbreak yet, extensive measures taken prevent ending like UNC/Alabama. course optimistic arrival freshman next week, seem pretty good plan place. realistic would us control this? person classes resume next week (with mandatory masks, person classes size, larger lecture halls smaller classes guarantee social distancing). every country remotely understood that, covid would dead. AFAIK, China reopen anything functional track-and-trace paired ability force people quarantine, top waited lockdowns effectively eradicated covid first place. understand country's logic reopening anything whilst there's still ongoing new cases spreading community. Exactly. Listen, one thing genuine learning disability, case already IEP getting resources help. parents saying ""But kid pay attention computer!"" Yeah, that's problem. raised kids discipline fiber chickens coming home (literally) roost. Time buckle get work take responsibility learning. Sounds like child concentration camps USA almost like herd immunity is/was worthwhile strategy, many us saying Show downsides home working, old order benefit more.

Some office-type jobs can't done home, exclusively home. friend works job requirement keep physical records premise, dumb is. record searches done records digitized, done office. But, said could get 1-2 days week office rest job working home.

Then work government, work done classified labs. can't done home. would, however, vast minority office jobs.

And feel like meetings better done person, small minority them. business travel, like 90% meetings could've done virtually without much impact all. IMO Florida might get break winter time. temperatures come back close 100 degrees, people start outdoors like northeast.

The data really reaffirms know: high risk factors age preexisting conditions. 

And majority us health really low risk death Covid. 

[CDC updates  will. read somewhere Reddit commenter heard lady radio claiming believe anything experience first-hand, therefore believes virus fake. real, would now. Yup, people actually think way.

That's useful document. interesting see risk compared activities/diseases.

It's clearly significant unwanted additional risk.

I guess risk would even greater went ignored disease completely would reduce take lot precautions.

What do? :) allowed come America send people hate America place. would giving ask every day here. According respiratory specialists 14 different strains. Stay safe rates resignation may little higher normal, teachers need income live on. cannot afford resign. types articles tend exaggerate resignation rate, **[Here excellent subject. published months ago. Please tell grandson Dr. Sidney Gottlieb! Strange ones still around kill way never provided kind covers. 💩 already did. said terrible situation. honor things, rising initial safer home orders. I'd love see sources full reopening nationally would change things. 

Are (and others) able go walk park, go run, meet friends family? I'm we're pretty much able everything like normal long mask inside? 

I think initial safer home orders definitely showed need mental health supports access country, I'm glad agree even called beliefs ""fucking stupid."" Lmao you’ve already contradicted multiple times buddy don’t even try acting like you‘ “got me”. Go mutilate girl wearing hijab Muslim boy According CDC numbers, guaranteed .2% chance dying whatever healthy are, 659934 death across us guaranteed. close 1928 pandemic numbers, also WWII numbers. given 108 million US 1918, 132 1940 looking something third(or less) deadly those, given R0 COVID higher 1918 let loose guaranteed high percentage deaths. furthermore, connected world before, expanding stats around globe, looking 15188000 guaranteed deaths. also take consideration R0 outside US.
that said, bias trust CDC personally careful side situation. think pro football player catches going get full physical exam including EKG? Teams going really cautious this.

Lol that’s testing works. Unless put bubble get infected even test them. People going without masks also fault everyone else’s safety. Maybe real country cared prepare inevitable occurrence. China. Half stuff made children forced labor. Talk concentration camps 2020. they're brown Mexico absolutely do.

You must've forgotten that. huge percentage Americans kind medical condition. That's happens access preventative medicine privilege wealthy. Exactly, making conclusions months foolish. Definitely administration. Hell, probably support this. Six months ago, maybe you’d leg stand on. Maybe.

Is correct?  think matters effective. first gotta clarify bias towards China report huge amount.
WHile bias, also lot connections China, mainland others, according China effectively created effective system tracking, monitoring, isiolatiing new cases timely manner.
that includes check point cities, bans inside country travel some, mandatory checks every day even leaving house, thermo cameras close 100% coverage population. Add China system communist system people believe country greater good worth individual results obiediance self intriguity sense ( big brother) everywhere. 
it plausible China numbers correct much underreported significant number new cases college students like plasma BS. Remember Covid related deaths, 95% occurred combination covid pre-existing often deadly disease. extremely rare anyone dies Covid alone.

The general level health considerably lower US compared Europe. number people sick, also lifestyle related problems like obesity/overweight.
I think difference US Europe massive comes health, comparison make much sense. Bold assume it'll get better think post clarification reddit, taken wrong way clarification abrupt.

Hope alright that's teens! imagine like younger children many supply requirements. also need know student paying attention struggling (hard see unless everyone cameras really good internet). someone asks questions get something need something repeated, way harder virtual classroom. also impossible quietly ask neighbor answer 4 missed teacher said. 

Finally notice way less stuff written ""on board."" That's issue learn seeing things writing down. 

I'm saying distance learning wrong choice think major drawbacks people anticipating. “Stupid stupid does.” build thousand bridges ... like touching face mask unwashed hands want lookout someone walk near entire time I'm walking dog. So, wear mask entire time. TLDR: UVC light causes cancer, fuck around know doing. Yes, simplistic statistics. well past idea disease affects elderly. populations equally affected, including obese, poc, diabetics. one good focus one subgroup. ""More 40,000 people died virus UK, one man’s sign said ‘fake science’ comparable ‘bad flu.’""

\- point get wind ICU. I'm baffled idiocy people; yes, get need money survive, yes, get huge mental strain some, yes, get need flexible people interact, deny science civic duty simple hygiene (like wearing mas) mind boggling.  example ... district did. punish anyone willing attempt digital learning. funny part older kids could manage sit meeting day chose offer person learning online. automated learning crap. entirety U.S. monumentally different times, also unable same.

The majority people see sprouting nonsense pandemics closings states see unable provide around them. government unwilling provide assistance meaningful ways look towards future. people unable provide themselves. 

I next doubt mind people given proper methods resources deal issues, could done. that's possible stuff like misinformation rampant people living paycheck paycheck hoping they'll get hours work next week.  stand abortion. family member needs one, is. case exception, want rule changes people exactly do. Egypt 200 new cases quite now. sure accurate is. makes sense given population still young. post got removed about? schools probably following NRA's ""school shield"" program involves turning every school prison. way spotting charlatan looking post somebody offers rebuttals calls charlatan. IFR consistently estimated around 0.5% several studies. direction that's going go due confusion dying 'with covid 19' dying 'from covid 19'. Unless find deaths government hiding..

And know know viruses? hell lot. Flu, example. qualifications exactly? Good luck destroying civil liberties economy waiting vaccine (if comes) particularly effective people trying protect. actually knowledge know that. like it, I'll stick conspiracy nutjobs. 

LOL, typical ""human"" response.

For uneducated maybe, plenty examples made author, community level throughout history, groups prone scapegoating. Generally speaking default reaction due lack information misplaced sense tribalism.

On individual level humans start life self-serving, develop adulthood (something never achieve) humans evolved towards empathy altruism, safety prosperity numbers. However, constant struggle developed adults, underdeveloped adults adults prone nature nurture behavioural variations sociopathy narcissism, scapegoating regularly found. religious civil ideologies offer laws moral guidance. would put forward well developed human adult, individual would seek resolve problem without resorting scapegoating, ethical option, option brings order knowledge chaos, gives us power environment (something us seek).

In contrast civilization governance still actively using ""scapegoating"" reinforcing perceived scapegoating populous tool achieve secondary agendas. last 8 months seen deluge misinformation, changing government strategies, original direction attempting maintain economic dominance rather solving problem. even seen evidence attempts governments name pandemic ""\*\*\*\*\* Flu"", ""human"" response academia ignore.

The author mainly discusses prejudices xenophobia's uneducated, goes attribute scapegoating human evolution. scapegoating capital political gain identified, included expanded problem description list ""Global Sampling"". author expand governance money also responsible scapegoating. find odd humanistic input problem clearly exists, greater influence causes harm caused politicians industrial interests.

I think author attempting use humanity, victims pandemic scapegoat failings governance economic interests work compete with. understand many unhealthy people United States? far tell, school administrators, school boards whole lot governors spent summer convincing kids could return school person kind sorcery. don’t follow logic. wouldn’t vaccinating kids good spread adults? won’t catch vaccinated kid suffering it. Citizens treated like literal prisoners. Wow. people hope future? one result current regime. crowded conservatism favor cultism. heard ""nail houses"" China?

In China house owners flat refused sell property government redevelopment yet none disappeared get organs 

In Singapore I'm from, government decided want land redevelopment find new home. could even say strongest considering former Mob influence unions, go that.

Isn't funny violent entities actually end power? say peaceful protest works - doesn't. MLK get much done lifetime, lot done riots assasinated. white people era generally despised said peaceful protests went far. Yes can, may future simple things right, like wear mask.  good warning. unfortunately, article somehow long hard read. felt bored read all.
ok, I'm aware dangers uvc light used disinfect also warning light usually accompany lamps... article could written bit better way.

this said, feel like *much more* warning this. mich concise, matter. Maybe pandemics like help thin stupid herd little. sucks inevitably take responsible ones them. 

But seriously, stupidity problem can’t fixed. like 5-10 still surprising people like exist Indian nearly fat America though, probably mostly mild cases 3 godchildren virtual best friend, mom, calls *at least* day tears can't deal way structured constant meltdowns. dont know world completely insane expect 2nd grader logged remote learning 8:45 4 pm, even lunch break. Like, dear God, theyre making kids PE virtual classrooms. guaruntee state police union.

Have tried randomly shooting choking people? works police union. /s.  honestly sounds like bunch propaganda hogwash. get it, mad get ""alone"" time, would sacrifice lives anyone else keep it. Need get first wave first Well mean mostly dangerous people 50.
As August 22, Less 5000 people died 45 years old US. millions infected. lower go smaller number gets. example, 280 people age 14-25 died. almost 60 000 people 85+ died. it’s false info say old people risk young people.

That’s CDC Nothing wrong knowing asking others help. Well.. long everyone feels better  Good. union isn’t going step fight safety yourself. Department Education could provide consistent guidance schools help make best practices, something bankroll student loans banks charge predatory interest rates for. One quote works jn china “ absolutely get paid for” interesting. live FL, article says schools opening past 2.5 weeks (so like early-mid August), makes sense since that's long enough us observing huge rise child cases article about.

But... FL's numbers actually deteriorating then? 7 day average appears continued decline, albeit perhaps slightly slower rate past week two. [percent declined period time. Rt remains [decently Hospitalizations [decreased 

This make sense me. I'm one disbelieve numbers they're going direction similar rate, make sense? actually possible open schools, stupid amount unchecked outbreaks possible outcome, somehow explode general community cause another spike? explanation this? what? mean abandon people concentrate resources there? like people color obese, ultimately helpful information. definitely saying dangerous 50. repeating false information. many at-risk groups helpful single one. Thankfully well estimates Ehh could've better. We're horrible species, Agent Smith right Matrix behave like virus, destroying whatever touch. Throughout history made life living hell lots fellow human beings, countless animals. world better place without rampant cruelty ignorance. Sounds like problem problem,some person en Lmao effective case numbers low - Melbourne overwhelmed.  Shit dont need half teachers one teacher teach million students. shits downright profitable fuckin love capitalism! feels scary thinking things next winter Depends deaths pick though. read morning whilst cases Europe up, actual hospital capacity required Covid-19 gone 7 8%. article argues new cases Europe currently driven younger people get significantly ill require hospital treatment even less likely probability dying.

Therefore see Europe seeing significant uptick deaths yet. least US overtaken several European countries death rate. Yeah :( shows India extremely undercounting Covid cases fatalities. reinforces incompetent are, specially light chaotic lockdowns. bad? nature taking course ... 90% mask wearing? live NY actual law see 80% city 70% rural. part nature, nature always defines future causes? Oh, still discussion... 


No, cannot compare deaths one week August one week January, e.g. deaths due heart deceases winter. 


There still deaths per week bad 2018/19 flu season. 


 Yes. US home inner sickest populations planet. can’t live high stress, eat shit food, take heaps medications expect healthy ... COVID not. Iatrogenic disease one leading causes death US never even makes news. Nobody tell America, need minute exactly hiding right now? wear masks lockdown. talking point seems unaware extremely common various comorbidities are.

For example, among comorbidities Hypertension.

55% people died COVID-19 US also hypertension.

This probably **45% Americans findings found 45.6 percent adults hypertensive 2011 2014 new blood pressure guidelines released 2017.  told keep door shut active shooter reasons 

That ridiculous. allowing guns get first place? talking point seems unaware extremely common various comorbidities are.

For example, among comorbidities Hypertension.

55% people died COVID-19 US also hypertension.

This probably **45% Americans findings found 45.6 percent adults hypertensive 2011 2014 new blood pressure guidelines released 2017. virus appreciates Alabama’s stupidity Ride free die and/or make others die Teachers organize force institutions go fully online. Fall (and Winter) coming going get worse. talking point seems unaware extremely common various comorbidities are.

For example, among comorbidities Hypertension.

55% people died COVID-19 US also hypertension.

This probably **45% Americans findings found 45.6 percent adults hypertensive 2011 2014 new blood pressure guidelines released 2017. Lost translation.... it’s okay... MAJORITY JAPANESE CITIZENS asian descent. Pick metropolitan city like New York Tokyo randomly pull 10 people street.. you’ll get higher majority Japanese asian citizens Japan... cultures American vs japan different..and percentages Japanese / asian vs American /different ethnic blending ..

I live Los Angeles California it’s multi ethnic city. don’t know live at, SEE city different hubs races , Japanese, Chinese, Koreans , latins , black, White , middle eastern, etc.. distinct cultures behave differently it’s strong here... 

Couple government actively doesn’t want “ immigrants “ you
Can see breakdown might occur sides. saying Japanese people/ citizens RESPECT laws governments way prevalent country here.......

Hence, American’s disregard fellow
Citizens....if president embraced every one like Japanese leaders do, wouldn’t problem followers disrespecting every ethnic group here. Come live country ( don’t already ) exchange notes weeks.... tangible way differentiate good bad teachers... Plus becoming teacher take much education doctor lawyer engineer they're seen easily replaceable  1 dissenting vote district? even remember much it. spent good deal first years schools huddled desks became part given. worries regarding kids regardless age same. clear middle high school kids like adults terms transmission handled such. wear masks continued meet friends family outside home. Talking quietly reason fared decently.... Doubling ""God's waiting room"" nickname, see. return person Sept 15, I'm barely keeping online expectations we're supposed teach in-person concurrently 40% coming M/T 40% coming T/F Wednesdays 100% virtual, still maintaining full distance learning curriculum remaining 20%...and no, allowed film stream teaching person count distance learners.

&amp;#x200B;

So setting aside impossible task teacher four unique preps 180 students rosters, also means I'm going physically exposed 80% students week.

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm giving week, see go madness, fully expect resigning. read signs, say hoax, others caused 5G, others masks increase infections rates (?!?!?).

You're giving much credit, people using brain. genuinely understand Florida teachers. Tbh able take classes online really sooo nice. able class’s comfort home. mean ""gain""? Theses idiots hold political power world over. even HIPAA FERPA? can’t release info. like 50 percent population? fan Elon, strategy worked well Tesla Wrong. Even getting people dont take responsibility. people tend lack empathy, care happens them. don’t know teachers survive year. much time prepare better remote learning governments worst nothing all. 

Wish best luck thank service. Might want research making invalid claims. donate whole body. funeral. implore talk doctor this. go back public do. taking mask order sneeze OMG!!!! Paint shocked. think thats early tests. think it’s better feel like people blame. Info wearing masks social distancing still see parties masks. Yes, obesity probably one number comorbidity. obese either.  Can't make people spend many lost jobs shut down. .... villages surrounding town, already 100+ cases. She’s type person send kids school sick Teacher (elementary Music) parent. knew kids would attending. hoping teach home could help too. Toss high risk icing cake. wondering thing. I’m sure people posting actually reading understanding implications.  don’t get it. see protesting reaction disproportionate threat, protest it’s hoax? ....man, people problem *everything* reddit. That's liberal mindset. kids important I'm elementary school teacher, dude. ""ageism."" much think. Direct cremation fraction cost. every state allows teachers unionize. SC doesn't. Indeed state fairly sizable restrictions 800-900 new cases day. given shit generation ago become life-and-death undereducating. problem undereducation incredibly dangerous teachers walking dying seem grab headlines. properly sad shit. right peacefully assemble human right, doesn’t matter you’re protesting for/against. Yeah, exhausted parent want live. sending daughter school fall. Nope. bet $10,000 Russia behind organizing (just like they’ve behind organizing “COVID Parties”). never knew this. That's amazing background. lot leaders lack empathy. Thanks info. Diseaseny World two sentences lie? me. would say half viral illnesses past 10 years caught plane. usually 3 domestic 2 international flights year. Harsh probably wrong word, agree post.

But vaccines high standards. need know works safe. giant new years festival kicked China outbreak high gear. Seems logical. isn’t highly unreliable? haven’t keeping eye antibody test believe May like almost 50/50 reliability scale? get paid peanuts. Resigned Monday last week. Sent letter superintendent, assistant superintendent, supervisor, principal. didn’t hear back one person. deleted email account Thursday guess. It’s Florida, expect? Yup, sounds right. Imagine proving dumb looking title article clearly even bothering read past headline

""Gradually, since end June, restrictions eased, although social gatherings remain prohibited. rate new infections shot again"" 

If bothered reading article get basic understanding Peru hit hard realize shutdown. Oh wow that's amazing I'm super jealous!! wanted get game art program went. go video game program fine art program? reputable website buy surgical masks? husband worried amazon dupes. fabric ones latest studies want get disposable surgical seem safer. Thank you! explanation that's throw around mandatory TB vaccine apparently boosts general immunity life long. think investigations aspect still on. Would pretty crazy true. Meanwhile ""free-market"" prime minister literally disabled disease resign. want take issue first sentence: care equally lives surviving pandemic. Everyone deserves able live face Covid.

I agree everything else said, thought “caring kids” misguided messed up. leads type sickening disgusting ageism see, people act like elderly willing die Covid people able go eat.

Life inherent value, old young. believe wonder many Americans know difference single payer public option. biggest problem see private insurance industry. They're big powerful see giving up. enough scientific information kids transmit virus (BECAUSE SHELTERED KIDS BACK MARCH!)

Yes, isn’t shame nursing home workers grocery store worlds don’t powerful unions protect them? Looks like r/conservative nutshell 😉 much increasing relative age groups? much increasing relative age group school reopenings? Details like would help interpreting numbers. That’s go on, willfully gullible constituent. also fact covid19 stats flow thru White House release, statements like ‘school coronavirus numbers confidential’, mention fucking mountain lies concerning nursing homes. Anyone stupid enough hear things still remote bit faith numbers fed throat professional liars deserves leadership now. 

Keep low IQ, inbred Floriduh. rest country would like saw state kick ocean. male infertility, testicular pain, ED, problem takes little liberty expressing opinions. much science hardliner. say things backed hard data. Even knows something true, everyone else knows something true, won’t say unless there’s evidence. 

He takes middle ground everything doesn’t add much personal input all. honest way things doesn’t sit right Americans today. used everything editorialized news. vast majority officers never fire gun know whatever lies need tell yourself... Would helped. I’m exhausted days, use help get. exactly what’s happening one surprised. Honestly, think 20 years going see massive spike lung cancer something. Hear hear. Literally changing schedules three days school started. Still making complete overhaul changes 10 days school year. Yes atrocious planning, definitely part teachers. Correct however reporting experience currently differ scale almost 
irresponsible. Yes. Everyone thinks expert know doctors!

Just like sports drafts everyone thinks they're gm. whatever reason, simply obese body mass clinical problem carries huge risk death COVID. put /s. long lock for, long wait? cases left even thought (0), far away 0 cases 1 million cases (as opposed 100 cases 1 million cases)?

The reason believe going lead disaster either faith covid American/Brazilian/whoever getting reseeding (the bomber ALWAYS get through), faith China must lying (there MUST coverup tens millions deaths UN can't report satellite China magically competent oppression somehow). fundamental questions whether reopening makes damn sense anyone else... \*appear\* miles ahead. gonna die Could get together indoors? Perhaps Victoria Albert get boris johnson speak? multiple different vaccines phase 3 trials. know they're protective primate models challenge virus. know produce neutralizing antibody titers stronger convalescent hospitalized patients recover. unlikely none work produced sufficient quantities entire year. people definitely sneeze four times day. people usually aren’t handwashing masks. throw mine laundry

Your mask isn’t supposed tissue. That’s it’s made for. Winter coming. Germany Plus police get kill people annoy them

The level stupidity site keeps exceeding expectations... Actually really wish limited here. Would give hope world likely get worse year over. 

Basic law physics: Every reaction meets equal opposite reaction. words shit **this bad** people going push back hard opposite reaction.  would written months ago. Focus vulnerable. clearly known die get 'flu'.

Nature published another study clearly saying dies gets 'flu'.. single public hospitalization. bet several. Trying get young child read lessons computer day pure Hell. Fixed IT? serious? ever met teacher worked school district? nearly non existent. underfunded one district technician entire district. One school technician 2000 kids tech needs well hundreds staff. living complete fantasy. Educator multiple school systems checking say apparently normal somehow considered ok. baffling. American labor movement shambles decades. They've never gotten support. one gets support unless they're seen expendable. Teachers different workers respect. Never say never. want enough fight it, get it. already polls around 70% among Americans increasing people see much pandemic screwing public Mass testing works differently. actually going test everyone positive rate low enough tests pooled. Depending expected rate type assay 32 samples pooled together, possibly more. Single tests patient symptomatic positive likelihood high enough pooling make sense. type test, called rapid antigen test even faster. basically like home pregnancy test. manufacture scale distribute it, could done really fast. Luckily India strong pharma medical manufacturing. go data, I’ve read nothing people ground claiming situation actually worsening hospitals overrun. think conspiracy situation ground catastrophic, burden proof you. You’re history major compared wearing mask social distancing Holocaust? 

Have taken courses deal WWII yet? feel really bad kids kindergarten. going first experience school? Agreed there. storm last forever. 

Hell I'm even stressed virus point crazy fucks emboldened states right now. Police get paid vacation every time pull trigger. extra time kill human. want NYC morgue pics like refresh memory? course does. Can't install proctor virtualbox? Italy starting see another day moving average new cases dropped ~200, back 1246 increasing.

The way we're getting herd immunity vaccination. BBC said children rarely spread it!!!! totally agree you. anti-maskers little bit always fall back on.

I personally feel strangely Fauci. Something always set alarm bells head. feel he's dishonest conniving. That's personal ""gut"" reaction. said, heard leans heavily toward pharmaceutical ""cures"" stands make absolute ton money that. surprised later discover Coronavirus really transmitted aerosol form 5 metres away. Brexit? friend who's conspiracy theories. would look straight eye answer ""Yes"" questions. Incredibly frustrating! Good luck getting job, hit news mass firings teachers record low attendance.  main stream narrative report it, not, reality. Districts financed attendance ""butts seats"". numbers way expectations year schools make personnel decisions. We’re actually Ca watch list due decreased Covid.

Same SD wish asking rhetorical question. really do. gotchu I, hardcore democratic socialist, first commend Trump ONE THING got right, considering everything works out. Credit credit due. take away blood hands crimes he's committed. Deaths always lag cases. rest assured going increase expect people act like people indefinitely?

No, there's vaccine viable treatment. need apply common sense. People Asia simply take seriously, like said people Shanghai doesn’t leave house afraid catching it. coworker went Taiwan said quantine 2 weeks allowed out. Can’t imagine things happening America Haha thanks. She’s friendly talkative. Sometimes gets lost conversation quickly forget. It’s intentional. don’t think really understands whole scope everything. I’m trying talk anything, is. 

She doesn’t ounce bad her. truth makes better person. Per University's 1,063 students tested positive since 19th, within last 12 days. 

The University 38,103 students enrolled currently.

If assume there's 1,063 active COVID infections (if assume ones longer infectious made newly infected ones), means **1 every 36 U students currently COVID-19**.

They canceled in-person classes yet.

🤷🏽‍♂️ Fun fact: Qingdao/Tsingtao famous beer used German-colonized city WW1

It's also place [it looks like People think comorbidities far less common actually think. know percentages top head, I'd say safe say people age 40 kind comorbidity this, obesity, heart disease hypertension. Peru worse brazil, chile too. Keep safe please know amazing job United STates starting see cases people getting Covid twice... immunity real. point.. Covid one fucked problems US see coming months. Hold onto pants dunno country welding people's doors shut. Making people stay indoors super effective way stopping spread virus. Oh thank god stupid people US problem Sounds like poor financial management me. Yep. thinking guys typed that. Music art library. PE benefit going outside. guys building subs like highest risk.

 I'm hoping typically resilient immune system hold almost always does. downside though, kind issue diagnosed yet. lung capacity randomly halved back March recovered. I'll deal best now. can't quit even start. need money maybe importantly, need maintain reputation. 

Anyway wish best luck. Stay safe, I'll say prayer us. never allow contact tracing locations tracked positive publish cross check others. many us think wearing masks hindering freedom ffs.

Just wait til see sort tracking surveillance Americans allow advertising ‘national security’. Yeesh, education upper manager lizard people now? mornings, coffee, waking think: virus gone. Then, actually wake remember dream. Teachers’ unions systematically stripped power exist all. police unions treated way. happening africa btw...i barely seen news...have actually handeled better countries mentioned above? went heroes zeros matter months. thank clarifying Wow, that’s bullshit. cannot see beneficial public health. I'm expert, seems 6% cases cause mentioned otherwise healthy people, risk factors, died *only* COVID. others would anyone another risk factor disease time dying COVID. 

So, I'm right, 6% scary number. one says healthy people killed this. 94% average 2.4 diseases conditions making COVID worse vice versa. 

I see people responsible failed response would want spin way, say 94% really died something else, reasoning make sense. source this? I've heard differently. Anyone ELI5 rebuttal meme 78,903 fresh cases, Saturday’s Covid-19 numbers India went past previous highest single-day count 78,427 infections reported US July 25, country witnessing biggest surge virus. sucks.

It's illegal us strike well, getting ready it. Going strike never fun, sometimes hand forced. enough scientific information kids transmit virus (BECAUSE SHELTERED KIDS BACK MARCH!)

I agree that, hindsight anyways, huge overreaction shelter kids March. don’t make mistake twice. Yes. So? What? UK longer part EU. Unless referring deal aware of? necessarily district thing. building built. Depending size school, every classroom going access outside directly leading lack windows. think classroom located next exterior wall, time window. Phase 2 establish safety. so, even 30% effectiveness would seem worth trying. downside potentially upside. Hope highly effective though. friend mine elementary teacher Canada, allowed bring mask home, supplied PPE year. right now, two masks, meant one day use, single pair blue latex gloves. Thats 2 masks gloves per day, thats they're pro.ised get entire school year.

Shits fucked can’t follow China measures much US/western cultures. 

We never allow contact tracing locations tracked positive publish cross check others. many us think wearing masks hindering freedom ffs.

Chinese people actually selfish cares lot, however selfish lives whatever takes stay alive, able vote makes people care politics long lives good. Xi tells people lockdown appeals people’s live opposed trump asking locking down, reopening, less tests re-elected. Xi doesn’t worry that, important goal keep virus people go work. age 94, survival feat Cashin, contracted coronavirus hospice care Longwood, Florida, assisted living facility. despite bleak outlook, multiple near-death instances before, Cashin pulled through, said Francis Cashin’s son, Mike Cashin. teacher. exactly happening. It’s two weeks going school early, staying late, going school majority weekends. brain feels like silly puddy, can’t even keep days straight! Teacher don’t quit kids, quit adults. city kindergartens expect kids 3 hrs Zoom.

Even I, 30 yo, cannot 3 hours video conference without going trance. 

More 40,000 people died virus UK, one man’s sign said ‘fake science’ comparable ‘bad flu.’ would add differences terms education requirements well. Teachers college degrees certifications they’ve tested for. Cops really basic training near sufficient warrant level pay prestige hold. Dude lol... that's arbitrary... also bizarre criticism given many people criticize engineering education actually teaching engineering. Profs academics mostly teach theory work teams, budget long term projects, distribute work, etc.

People usually learn stuff job.

It's minor thing crap many dislikable qualities grocery store workers unions like teachers we’d starved now. Public unions need destroyed. allow organization whose express sole purpose negotiate interests taxpaying, voting public. unelected yet set policy fundamental functions government. Insanity.  dragged asshole Governor’s office yet? serious reading comprehension issues. And, definitely need medication issues.  word advice. lecture fiancee something seriously may something want think SERIOUSLY gets late. I’m fed world Arizona high school science teacher said resigned job loves district voted return students in-person classroom learning—creating health risk many teachers say willing take. drives insane teachers part blame membership low. can't get people join chance strike. sucks. teachers need get state realize poorly treating us. former high school teacher, definitely understand this. bloody well hard enough keep paperwork nonsense around teaching see kids controlled environment school. deal one individual home situations, developing good remote teaching resources, working around scheduling difficulties, missing personal interactions in-person teaching (or worse, dealing anxiety in-person interactions added risks students even dangerous disease vectors usual), salary commensurate manager McDonalds restaurant, would made want leave even left. would especially true if, like me, degree STEM field much remunerative less dangerous alternatives readily available.

For me, chemistry teacher US, made mid-career move pre-COVID wife went job hospitality (which paid little job Bachelors degree 3ish years experience part) almost year hospitalization eating disorder (which built LOT debt us, especially shitty health care plan options teacher) position half prior salary graduate student. financial pressure, MS chemistry let double salary private sector spend entire adult life screwed medical credit card debt, working half hard teacher. went engaged enthusiastic teacher (that built two brand-new AP course programs school 3 years working there) successful cube dweller, slightly less screwed way treat teachers country, would still inspiring kids science rather absorbing fluorescent light within carpeted walls (or, COVID, spending 40ish hours week sitting home office apartment). don’t see doctor often enough ask question. 

Dr. Knighton CDC disagrees really adamant this, it’s pretty clear don’t know you’re talking about. Absolutely BS. Another post fear monger us. Cases hospitalization death rate declining nearly every state. doubt even go past 200k let alone 300k. virus dead be. People dying got long time ago. links post saying life expectancy entire nation drop 1-2 years mean people dying covid would dead anyway 1-2 years. people get covid recover, lifespans normal. enough die prematurely enough drive entire population's average lifespan year two terrifying comforting, requires lot significantly premature death. taking many years many people, dozens years some, handful (older). COVID-19 directly destroys lung tissue. body attempts prevent may experience high fever inflammation. uncontrolled fever lead brain damage death. Lung inflammation aggravate preexisting asthma, COPD, etc cause pneumonia even preexisting lung disease. also reports damage blood vessels throughout whole body I'm less familiar specifics that.

Just die complication disqualify COVID-19 reason died year.   Isn’t reporting skewed though governor? Unfortunately large amount people world believe Corona virus worse flu. whole lot virus political. One party doesn’t believe bad party takes seriously whole lot people stuck middle. sad USA going through. live South. red quite blue too. guess Independent don’t care either party. Educators never really give enough teach future Citizens schools. many “things” important leaders today good chunk things always almighty $. think fewer politicians teachers paid well might much better chance future Amazing leaders! go back, also teach remote person kids time.

That actually sounds great. wish school. Instead skipped almost got expelled. Honestly, gives us idea hard find adult America without comorbidities listed. left immediately? doesnt work. provided internet computers kids. still wont log on. figure force kids log virtual learning instead playing games hanging friends dont see successful. We've positives building staff working summer. ridiculous think could go back person instruction vaccine rapid testing. almost markets bad thing organize society around.................. would know Morton death sentence spreading reign ask states. man grim reaper Alot teachers retired early school district, running teachers. Good thing many retiring, many new people getting hired. bad thing people still choose taking care kids risking health concerns taking school. Yeah. Music here. same. see kids. classes duties. I’m relying diligence keeping distant safe, luck, prayer. bs? Genuinely curious, literal CDC data website. Maybe comorbidities people confused one lesson learn pandemic, countries take short-term pain tough lockdown, recover economically, countries take halfhearted measures. Surely Indian government aware this. yet someone Reddit told Sweden religiously following social distancing able control Covid cases. Yeah else got Reddit? People would accept Sweden beat virus absolutely nothing it’s viable strategy us states need time population.  Odd thing is, there’s 97+% she’ll fine. argument won’t change. common knowledge

You linked one article interprets biased data, three reference flawed study. 

If useful data, I'm it. source work less hours? could believe rest work 7 hour days 182 days year. cant imagine police officer works less hours that. almost month nobody died yet. Give up. American feel awkward precautions need done family barbecue.

""Yeah, family smart safe, it."" Hard fuckin pass. Exactly this. could’ve months prepare. Months communication families hit ground running day one. 

Instead going go months shock everyone switch back distance learning drop hat. survive? Fair enough. blame Brits wacko doctor too. ;) I’m waiting school quietly stop testing, tbh. Fellow music teacher here. I’m lucky it’s general music elementary. it’s still super tough. Hands-on do! 

I feel much. Sending love virtual hugs. tested positive COVID Thursday. fever, sore throat, slight cough, aches. Felt awful Wednesday Thursday. Felt better Friday little better today. feel like umm getting soon. Ok still quarantined room till Friday regardless mother law showing symptoms now. took hospital get tested. Dr said it, wary day 9, that’s breathing troubles could arrive. anyone know going like roller coaster I’ll feel ok today feel like crap Monday something worst case scenario? Going send message dr figured I’d try get crowd reaction here. Let know. government forcing 2.5 million students sit engineering-medical entrance exams 2 days. testing keeps up, expect huge surge number cases couple weeks. Literally every industry adapt this. Teachers group continuously strike kids use pressure can’t strike retire legally things union strong at. almost impossible remove tenured teacher matter minimal effort do. One last schools worked teacher punch kid got hearing due union. Sooo... think likely get school shooter covid? That's completely fucking ridiculous. I'm sorry. Annoying, make fact 25% many signs out, ones 100% larger. Huge flags, giant signs windows...his followers like living embodiment spirit: ""If can't dazzle intelligence, scream go away.""

I can't wait November. I'm taking day celebrating. And? point still stands. Yea think right teachers. get came agreement, sounds like nightmare. illegal NYC teachers strike well. England manage fast? people along way..... thinking selfish. completely agree. radical protesters BLM side understand people protesting stay home/mask orders. commenting OP’s comment motives. relevance discussion though? You’re saying want lockdowns bring collapse research academia? did... read caption...? agree virus stay dormant fat tissues maybe, like influenza. Yikes Russian, perhaps?

I'm reminded of, early COVID, posters Staten Island ""grassroots"" protest. single soul showed up. can't even train kids corporate spies future food them? *Sarcasm*  see you’ve never met Robert California. Could also lucky asymptomatic spread.

Love see somebody crunch numbers. reason 7 proven genetically sequencing virus first time, person gets again, genetically sequencing second time, proving different strain (so relapse). 

The number low people get virus sequenced, two different strains. dad got antibody test done see faint line G, hallucinating? Could mean indeed COVID-19? spent week around 1.5 months ago pink eye, sore throat ear pain curious. Thank

WHOLE WORLD. students text books workbooks follow televised content. homework, assignments send teacher via google classroom. friends even using what’sapp parents send teacher pic work done. great effort communicate set expectations students. weekend, employees home, work. numbers get updated come back work. say “the pandemic become political” less accurate than- among Republicans, taking health precautions stem pandemic become litmus test. party believe health Americans important economy America. Protecting economy collapse means taking risks people die. 180K died part price willing pay. 
The final bill yet come due. quit. grandma got lung cancer charter worked going open even though school district not. shamed concerns carrying virus onto family. Grandma way better now! Goddamn ever hate piece utter garbage republicans come anti-worker, anti-american laws.

They absolute scum earth deserve nothing less burning eternity hell (whether real not, definitley deserve it.) There's zero evidence linking vaccine autism. however proven connection Andrew Wakefield conman gave birth myth order make easy  states made illegal teachers strike. agree 100% willing change based new science, point changing systems constantly one cares system we're seems like Kafka beaucratic nightmare even worth trying untangle. feels hard say following sciencewhen first plan came seemed cautious scientifically sound - come june completely threw away let CA open even though cases still rising places... close things weeks cases started skyrocketing (insert shocked pikachu face). gotta feel businesses gave greenlight open for, spend ton money goods supplies reopening safety, shut help end sight. Overall, I'm fan governor, fan handled crisis start, seems misguided choices along way constantly changing systems one them. actually excluding South Africa. prevailing theories average age Africans something like 19 years old. second one adequate vitamin levels prevents cytokine storms kill younger people. third sleeping open air seems positive effect. (There's also recorded deaths homeless population relatively speaking). Obviously, unverified, thinking. gonna lie. read India probably 160 million cases, unreported due inadequate testing. silver line India reach herd immunity anybody else. also true genetic disposition acclimation relative poor quality environment given immunity plethora diseases might case low mortality rate. Quietly let infected students fly home
To parents country still travel certain degree diplomats plus think black market drug smuggling. came work... SYMPTOMS? option work home?! im pretty sure shit pay undervalued fuck also contribute it. 

Hey guys lets go college 4 years minimum graduate average starting salary 36-38k student loans ensuring another 10 years finical hell front us! OP’s link says it’s 7. assume maybe it’s 10x that. Why? state since beginning Corona harmless. know reason incident March? checked antibodies? 
And thanks. certainly will. American stupidity leaking.. unless elderly people left antibodies (or memory cells since antibodies 36 day halflife), old vulnerable already died Covid. Well shady shit Fauci knife. Wouldn’t surprise Trump would try spin Dont go far one likes Robert Murdoch pushing covidiet narrative. I'm going bars restaurants thanks lockdowns stopping community spread am. Lockdowns worked spectacularly. thank much... kind words really appreciated trying times heard before? 🤔 Thank you, gets negative there. nice see kind words while.

Man, know high Pune. chance look epidemiological data. Usually reasons densely concentrated populations people following norms type super spreader event. One reason insanely high testing rate. We've done almost many tests Mumbai quarter population. still, rising daily deaths depressing. 

As Bihar, could well case gross reporting cases. know working places cannot really say much them. high? Hit nail head! almighty $ !!! many teaching friends Canada. teacher glut/shortage depends live. Many places Ontario, example, currently bringing foreign teachers fill void. live Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver $50k pension? Maybe Winnipeg Edmonton...  Perfect time Education Reform America  don’t think anything nefarious going on. honestly think it’s attempts districts keep throwing money problem people feel like it’s safe. 

I don’t think plexiglass manufacturers stake lobbying close ties local governments. Could wrong knows. Nice. nation dumb dumbs coming right up! Asimismo, 30.450 son costarricenses (+1016 respecto ayer) 9249 son extranjeros (+198), dato que incluye además las personas residentes.

Wow. realize CR lot foreigners account 30 percent cases? Certainly 30 percent people living CR can't foreigners -- even counting non-citizen residents. reason account large proportion cases?

And man, R0. ☹️ thought UK opted EU deal Astra Zeneca provide 400 million doses vaccine? Norway get access vaccine via Sweden. Apparently ok us buy need sell Norway reason? exactly hospitals hiding patients? Many web site tracking beds covid patients. Oh wow, guess missed couple interviewed 30,000.

My point *most* accept bad flu going around, protests useless politically orchestrated lockdown measures.

You thankful them, big government would simply way people go call bullshit. grimmest book world records teaching last several years. Got new job January, ever knew COVID gonna hit like did. 

I think used life’s luck one moment. You’re unhinged asshole blinded hate. state involved kind mass conspiracy hide number new cases, somehow getting hospitals board hoax. virus peaked that’s things work goof. Nearly every county implemented mask mandate baboon. Bars closed 2+ months imbecile. nation lockdown international borders closed. mom teacher. high risk. school decided resume person. family convinced teach (we lucky sense livelihood depend ability teach, really enjoys it). decided ask leave absence essentially take risky year off. Instead, school offered let teach virtually, hired another person essentially babysit students virtually teaching. students 12-14. Sounds like good idea, everyone story sounds smart rational far right? 

Enter parents. Well children’s parents complaining newly hired person qualified around “blossoming” child. person, literally hired make sure child listens teacher zoom hours day, apparently good enough (sight unseen). want know parents want happen? want trusted teachers risk lives teach kids? pay teenagers babysit kids go out, that’s classroom go work it’s acceptable? want know people complain every possible situation. You’re getting kids house, getting teacher, teacher isn’t putting risk, you’re complaining this. Why? want understand logic. Venting completed. I'd look made money connected makes decision. means there's way way that. like ppl would tell anyone got it. Yes.

The British Union Fascists also turned wave flag reportedly went unchallenged - tells something Brexity crowd was... Would we? doubt it. know, really getting many coworkers wear masks campus. I'm ""techy"" one get 2-3 people per day coming help, 50/50 either wear masks take off. think I'm going put sign door asking people wear come room starting drive mad. want get thing think care whether do. People still moving (flying, cars, trains, etc...) out. would know? None things reliably counted ministry truth gets hands it. begin, Party’s values, rooted Marxism-Leninism, offer view politics incompatible values United States allies. Free World today, see individual people ends believe liberty worth prioritizing, even makes political decisions difficult costly *even times works collective security well-being*. Leninism, contrast, makes individuals means towards achievement collective ends. Beijing, Lenin, collective material welfare (“common prosperity” Party’s contemporary official lexicon) rather political freedom criterion judges success.

[Testimony U.S.-China Economic Security Review know Americans like say, ‘he would trade liberty security deserves neither’, retort ‘he trades security liberty middle pandemic winds dead’. Sure thing. [Here Bullshit. hasn’t worked all. Run Forrest, run. Lol know right? It’s insane watching morons defending CA saying ‘Uhhhh yeah test more, higher population, blah blah blah’ headline Florida comes it’s somehow end world. Teachers area quitting they're whining keep cleaning rooms wear masks teaching.

I imagine disgusting classrooms must overloaded custodial staff is, frustrating wife pre k teacher who's months still seen babysitter field complained once.

Those ""babysitters"" ones make sure child count, write, develop social skills, etc instead letting ""real teachers"" 20 kids equivalence pudding cups students population homogenous SIR epidemiological model. people susceptible, people jobs / commutes / households bring exposure higher viral titers. saw Covid19 race groups NYC/tri-state area, groups exposed, remainder population less susceptible lower exposure. Initial viral titer makes difference outcome. 

Medical treatment improved. First peak supportive care focus ventilators. taught clinicians important interventions anti-inflammatory corticosteroids anti-clotting heparin/enoxaparin, ventilators avoided long possible. places clinicians whole panoply potential treatments, without randomized trials, difficult say elements responsible benefit, they've gotten hospitalization death rates 20-25% \~6%. comes r/coronavirus hivemind downvote hell. people pathetic. Absolute losers Taiwan small.

But yeah - they're islands far enough places limit access air screen everyone enters.

They're also serious countries efficient governments cohesive population. probably don’t know word syllabus means didn’t give health insurance would’ve already  That’s becuase per capita CA averageish 


Per capita states not. Fuck governor ""mayor jaws"". drove Chicago south Florida help elderly father fuck flying. ghoul. Seems like alternative - going back school unprepared deadly pandemic - risking lot strike would. get though. It’s called data error whomever filled paperwork busy fill rest. Covid kills via cardiac arrest ARDS among things get listed covid death certificate. seem repent get infected. Plenty “well would wish anyone” videos there.  think virus fake.

Lots people particular protest holding signs saying virus fake.

If don’t think virus fake, holding signs saying virus fake? It’s really really bad. I’ve relatives I’ve looked whole life share disgusting things regarding recent events. reason major disconnect people don’t realize sharing spreading garbage. 1.2M JEE+ 1.6M NEET, close 3million :/ site link publishes these? must rely empathy intelligence American people far hasn’t impressive true, wife works made law new teacher unions formed fall 50% must disband union. also aren’t allowed discuss encourage joining union. don’t understand kind rules enforced anyone see rule immediately understand need join union. 

I say leave profession. Anything better sacrifice. wish teachers valued enough realize worth get better jobs. think teachers care much. system doesn’t care them, business transaction. Everyone loves kids you’re worth give deserve better treat you. like every child (and person) learns differently, things government school admins needed kind plan months-long period plan.

And said (emphasis mine):

“Calling state educational neglect unsuccessful **none cases opened.**”

I wasn’t expecting perfect rollout. However, far short even rocky rollout. Lol learned lesson! fuck talking man? fuck downvoted?! I'm currently participating study already received first dose. study lasts year find received actual vaccine placebo end study. I'm curious would affect want sure I'm vaccinated soon possible time NYC blew already late lock one city. Oh no, all. won’t someone frugal money me. grew broke, won’t it. It’s insurance cost much, working healthcare know really can’t anything sadly. don’t illness need meds, thank god, get without insurance now. get older like everyone else, I’m sure healthcare wise. Insurance costs much. mortgage, girlfriend, trying save bit, spending money, I’m done. pay insurance, point I’m working pay insurance. It’s shit either way see it. I’m teacher India currently highest number new daily cases. ~75,000 daily. government wanting open schools soon September 21. legal 12 states actually. still happens however. Go on? live appear things getting control. Cases, positivity rate hospitalizations going downward time now. still way fucking many cases supposed first-wotld nation.  brand Florida Who?  free Covid. fuck place‼️ China found another positive case Taiwan. That's quite absurd. One sisters teacher. summer began, told expect teach in-person reopen (Tuesday Labor Day). Last month, told change curriculum 100% online, provided list software school would provide (zoom, adobe rooms, etc)

Yesterday, told they'll using Skype Pro. everything. asked supposed give AP calc exams, told figure herself

Piss-poor communication district, case unique  Imagine thinking saying “hooked liberty” burn. average American exposed stupid, selfish, indecent. died? local blood bank is! read base rate fallacy. sake children everyone come contact with, keep fighting good fight. video need watch order know China mess around comes say numbers report fully truthful, definitely think completely unrelated reality people might think. per virus probably stronger immune system given daily life lack sanitation. Though life expectancy overall lower average result. would develop long term health issues even stop daily diarrhea. going every state soon. Southern states often start earlier others. Anyone working hours day ER say covid policy. disgusting omg. mom underlying health issues retired teaching. she’s remote teaching 2x salary. Stay safe y’all. Pennsyltuckian.  sisters district opened weeks ago already started quarantine kids first hand exposure. Parents sending kids school knowing they’ve exposed. (In example classmate nephew who’d contracted ... parents.)

From I’ve read first hand exposure happens parties aren’t wearing masks, required attend said school. 
This school system one largest high schools Indiana. 

We live ten minutes apart, district e-learning parents already pushing return person schooling. 
It frustrating home learning it’s better coma! feel teachers probably would frustrated too. 

I’m worried us. 🌎 two going don’t choice. could chosen distance learning can’t afford lose fiancé’s pay. (As teacher, don’t make much.) 

I trust kids obviously, faith teachers safe. faith kids around kids teach. understand it, neighboring countries Finland, Norway Denmark also relatively normal lives -- lockdowns indeed short situation sustainable. 

""Was"" sustainable? defeated virus, they've managed hide temporarily. Yes, stopped running around like chickens fox paid visit shed.

It bit different here. Around 1000 people arrived daily Wuhan. clear beginning activities come late. island absolute fatality rate 0.001%.

Countries decided look countries low fatality rates tried methods. So, basically failed. brand Alabama. local high school required teacher students home students classroom simultaneously normal block schedule. 

Their computers don’t cameras microphones. provided webcams. make lies fit agenda... Ok... keep living delusion. Smart. understanding viruses vulnerable silent treatment. society ever respected teachers job. plenty jobs like take skill important, market care never has. Guys even mom lives keeps asking come mean ....???????????? won’t convince someone think will? lol believe specifically checks flags virtual environments One cousins art teacher. say ""was"" quit rather expose family dozens kids, definitely covid. 

So quiet going homeschooling kids. least qualified. convinced wife take year leave. salary deductions barely covers day care costs daycare safe children currently. We've trying best protect prevent spread five months, meanwhile see many people trying least. endanger children teach children? lot leaders lack empathy

not lot *good* leaders Vietnam agree exist till lands doorstep admin communicate you, when? strawmanning. assumed talking Facebook memes talking mask effectiveness general. New studies come showing masks effective, Im shocked meme Facebook inaccurate. find problematic seem go from, ""a meme inaccurate "" ""masks aremt effective lie"" hardly rational train thought Whoa. knew? Totally surprise golly gosh gee uh huh. That's also meat tenderizer, yuck understanding N95 mask filter air coming in/out, surgical masks filter incoming particles (covid particles air small). believe surgical mask helps preventing spread cough/sneeze, catches large droplets. 

Can someone please correct I’m wrong? Hmm parents Shanghai. ""official"" lockdown point time - like could go grocery shopping, exercise park, etc. coming going apt tracked. people allowed apt delivery people residents. late January, people panic buying masks seldom left house. mom went buy iPad grandma, person mall. point time, less 100 cases city 34 million. Schools workplaces already closed holidays remained closed April/May. Temperature taking hand sanitizer usage mandatory entrance every building mask-wearing enforced (my dad got scolded police officers multiple times). first time parents saw friends face-to-face 2020 June. 

I living Bay Area earlier year. huge testing shortage offices still open, people STILL throwing parties, wearing masks, etc. Bay Area praised reacting ""early"" freaking slow reacted compared Shanghai. packed bags ran China beginning March. 

There way China could covered tens millions deaths uncontrolled pandemic. city dense: people live apartments, everyone takes subway, air-conditioning full blast, people eating restaurants like crazy, people even wear masks anymore. one person sick COVID, would spread like wildfire (like Korea rn). also got anti-body test curiosity recently. line all, got results straight away. 

I assume eventually outbreak Shanghai way saw clusters Chinese cities. expect involuntary lockdown point. meh, vastly superior sheltering-in-place months. much rather China watching movies cinema going Disneyland meantime. like... complex get pandemic control. China anything special strong public health messaging CDC making sure sufficient PPE resources everyone people stay home essential workers safe. Polio corona two different things...not even comparable honestly. smoking sign cigarette break Unless asymptomatic like 80% cases won’t hospital bill. Tldr: gatherings 100 people allowed social distancing measures, train services resume major cities, schools remain closed Globalization won’t allow this, much right thing That's cooked spices antibacterial effect gut. Smashmouth somehow. Maybe don’t run education system like business.  Bergamo attack rate yeah, they're likely much closer herd immunity 5-15% places report.

And recent definitive cases reinfection expectation immunity wanes time pretty much puts herd immunity completely reach. Sheep living better humans 2020 America. Wow! Republicans really tired power whatsoever. There’s going blue tsunami. Names, yes.
Numbers, much. absolutely true, america, true Trump's election, also reason getting rid trump alone little fix america. good advice didn’t take fuck dude??? Every headline see making stupid decisions ever??? I'm sys admin school. matter brand new computers, like example. asked implement system takes year planning months execution less 3 months. impossible, specially departments schools underfunded understaffed hell.

Also, people technology inclined, making even worse. teachers importantly *seasoned* teachers expendable all. good teacher get child way one else instill confidence.

Their experience invaluable shaping children public school teacher highly respected position. 

Unfortunately, people seem forgotten value education country constantly slipping ranks internationally.

I get saying get out. infuriating badly we've treated teachers past 40 years. giving *you* vaccine enable wish come true. Faster, cheaper = less accurate, sure that? seems likely one point year least school districts going close completely thanks lack staff. teachers quiting, getting sick classes reopen, able find replacements literally staff run things.  don’t move deer crossing signs prosecute people call 911 car hits deer. deer problems. president thanks you. People like allow people like fester. Congrats. That's still ≈ $600k USD, exactly chump change lol  yeah we're doing. ""hybrid"" method. option floated semester back May. KNEW would choose option looks best parents public large -- conveniently one fucks teachers most. regulations

found missing Randian time detect sarcasm reddit. time though. *"" second study, unadjusted analysis showed significantly
protective effect N95, medical cloth masks""*

It right there, damn study.

They 1 situation reduction transmission. perfect use (hospital settting n95)

Got bad news brochacho. people world hospital (controlled setting new mask everyday) wearing correctly. 

[That pretty little graph Aunt Cathy showing ways mask reduces transmission.  Well, makes sense. second populated country world high population density. infection number may high infection rate per population going low. Chinese pay tests. happened country. Simple that. Wisconsin? live Bay Area. teachers starting salary around $60k USD. decade so, getting $80k USD fairly normal. number classmates graduate school became teachers local area

There cop area posted /r/publicfreakout shooting less-lethal shot non-violent protestor. makes $200k USD 

Cops make ~3x teachers make Bay Area. mention better benefits (especially retirement) ummm...that's we're also. Constant live-stream lessons kids home *while* we're teaching kids class. get it..but insane probably untenable. 

And I'm building sub. I'm going cover class kids person kids learning remotely, immediately pick particular teacher handling particular lesson. 

For $115/day taxes. 

And deadly virus floating around. people difficulty creating antibodies specific diseases. think seen something like 5-6 people get second time, 6 million disease US odds good. pressing question happens yea now.  Practicing Pune new epicenter. Hospitals full , 50,000 active cases. feel swamped ICU. us breaking point mentally. People die virus, bad. I’ve thought can’t risk losing health insurance.

*laaaaaand freeeeeee* I'm boat. I'm trusting snake oil salesmen improperly/dangerously/dishonest pressure regulators. give shit election might safer vaccines equal safety/efficacy? Hmmmm. Pretty sure that's works. &amp; ""it"", mean ""anything""  order magnitude easy get maximum sentence court overturn set ruling (here, already delivered fine) coming money contract? *HUGS* right thing. teachers ever get support admin? I've teaching admin 7 years one ever helped anything. Yes, lot work rework class distance-based, context needed. many people afforded ability safe stable paycheck right now. redesign entire class accommodate situation. complain right tone-deaf. windows original buildings high school opened. school built 1957 air conditioning swamp coolers there. would unbearable windows open, barely bearable was. Roll...SHUT UP! appreciate it, yes, am. probably get tested soon, Im trying pay extra close attention meantime. loosing BEST teachers right now.

Tons great teachers teach income, teach passion it.

My Mom taught 30 years even though fine Dad's income.

She decided hang hat. worth it. sad it. tipping point 2nd wave I'm sure That's plan adjust curricula upcoming year, often discretion administration state requirements Pam Beasly become cat scientist? Harleys sale. Man, Republicans get travel ban? Let? actively knowingly voted for?  Behind every bad American politican bad voters. Behind bad voters Fox News Facebook Memes telling bad good. I'm sorry exactly online daycare. Good. achieve herd immunity faster avoid deaths future. Overall rates daily cases deaths Florida clearly decreasing. recently thought wanted visit England. team?! LMAO. know I'm black, right? Reported, anyhow. Glimmer hope, whatever. trying minimize you’re saying, time, common refrain “plan worst, hope best.”

We haven’t done least. planned **best**. now, see that’s working out, hey, what’s hundred thousand people perpetuating madness compared able get hair did?

We entered summer seeing infections going up.

What makes *anyone* think reopening schools *real* backup plan distance learning place good idea? glad see USA country lots whack-jobs. Take look bottom homepage here:

He also lists site LinkedIn profile. Hmm rule would mean we'd pay global HIV costs example Yes... India, covid infected poop lying open ground.... Already hate flies. Wonder impact spread Sars 2 get scientific data imgur No, team following neonazi playbook intertwined politics. ok. organized disinformation movement side. simply exist. live Iowa, masks required almost businesses downtown, head town it’ll rare find mask. There's flu vaccine. Still flu. Clearly didn’t see one coming.. /s Try get pulse oximeter also monitor oxygen levels. things relatively cheap, they're good things handy even without Covid. They're must every household's medkit alongside thermometer, IMHO. Wish getting downvoted. let sub get way truth. Nope immigration-education industrial complex would like word. Lol you’re fucking dumb then. pain horrid, literally nothing bad comes vaccine. I’m psychologist public school never seen hate public school educators. Many teachers open schools taking leaves absence can’t risk health health family members. community angry means many schools can’t open. calling teachers lazy. Calling fired jobs. thing is, remote learning far work us. Far work far less results. want nothing go back way things were. don’t want risk lives it. Minnesota looking good. ""No""? Maybe he'll start washing hands got caught thank kind stranger 🥰 don’t want cat leader?? all. don’t want Queen purple ducks following me. Stop breathing planet. Definitely wrong. may work well n95 still greatly reduce much particles breathe in. important I've read disease severity likkely related viral load exposed to. even modest reduction could mean difference asymptomatic mild case vs severe case. thought lag cases deaths like 4 6 weeks. several days 2 3 weeks written.
I also strongly feel data coming India (where live) accurate manipulated bjp government (which controls much media). Somehow bad news India goes strongly desired nationalist / patriotic narrative required government.
Number deaths suspiciously low. Yes population age India low total size population India large, even low percentage number old vulnerable people huge. existing morbidities (diabetes, lung heart disease) also high.
I also find studies antibodies population suspicious considering high rate growth New cases.
I confidence accuracy integrity current government.  wish everyone could understand willing this!! Still gets drunk portion price. Right wing tactics reflected academic institutions shockingly consistent right wing governments’ mismanagement catastrophe. issue dependent ton factors. Lets say Sweden hit herd immunity 20%. 

That means countries similar health infrastructure, population density, hygene, mask utilization, test turnaround...etc also see number cases reduce time.  new field go into? (Current sped teacher immunocompromised child home.) Dissenting disinforming.  Public unions limitations. Normal unions bargain workers owners. public sector unions bargain workers public, makes giving lots power less critical.

Furthermore, public sector unions often extreme leverage bargaining. bay area public subway (BART) union strikes, practically shut whole city. result BART janitors sometimes make 200k.

I support labor unions generally public sector unions little different. sad private sector unions ground dust. possible lawsuits others thing and/or Trump office? clear they've acted interest ethics &amp; best practices multiple occasions. Like, way worse even early days AIDS pretty damn bad. one major vaccine rushed unsuccessful mean one be, too. 

Of course previous failures guarantee rushed covid vaccine also unsuccessful. certainly make everybody pause think taking rushed vaccine. explanation previous rushed vaccine turned unsafe, changed avoid problem time covid vaccine. disease lethal enough, lockdown force resolve within households (to death recovery), rather transmitted community, considerably important. law enforcement able arrest individuals without seriously risking lives. Anything get Rt well 1 long enough clear infectious agent local communities. 

Covid's sort disease. past infectious diseases case fatality rates 50%, yeah enforcing quarantines would considered seriously. understand frustrations learning disabled students, trouble online teaching average students?

Is learning different medium teach from?

I understand ones retiring early probably ""don't get computer"" never really tried to, average would hope could manage operating video camera glorified message systems assignments. 

What biggest hurdles teachers teaching online average student? I'm grateful daughter's school district actually used summer prepare distance learning. Teachers got hardware use training use software. Servers upgraded, Chromebooks distributed scheduled contactless drive pick books materials. daughter 1st grade even 4 hours instruction, hard sit still stay engaged. commend teachers best can, less support teachers district. absolutely criminal way country treats educators. deserve much better. told going bar 20% chance giving hospital bill would bankrupt me, would stay home. Oh wait, that's I'm doing. health insurance...we need that. WOW. ABSOLUTE FUCK. state? Going hard US top India purely population standpoint. way percentage population. I'm sure exist canada heard rally's seen anything news. could wrong... global pandemic continuously since early 80s Lose pension? one paid into? may strike? That’s great all, there’s difference “we don’t time train” forcing teachers go back in-person school and/or hobbled POS isn’t even curriculum *as merely outline* teach children.

I seen firsthand last years. Teachers begging parents front cost school supplies many years. They’re paid even cost living, they’re still expected teach children pockets. Teachers expected get sick die now? wouldn’t stand shit even second place, teachers expected so?

We’ve seen pandemic developed. Last school year, cancelled classes. you’re trying tell wasn’t enough time “plan worst, hope best?” absolutely planned best nothing else. This, pandemic gotten **worse**.

They absolutely time prepare. didn’t. multiple ISDs closing things plan A, *only* plan, isn’t working way wishfully hoped. Source? Crazy. There’s going books kind stuff years. going interesting reads, it’s terrifying live through. FUCK THAT? Get tested strep throat. sure surprised, though. American public education shitshow.

Also, saying teachers can't frustrated. frustrating situation in. Context important deciding publicly complain about, though. There's difference complaining brother shitty work situation news interview it. Good luck baby. actually read plan, it’s significantly slower restrictive reopening happened May June. Yeah me? force 2 women together conflicting agendas? messed up. Fight club. Nasty. literally idea whether abused not. zero training remote teaching well. Two cousins teachers. One full remote zero training. second? &lt;Drumroll Zero training remote zero training life Covid world. BEST PART? teaches art children severe disabilities. Again: zero training keep kids, immunocompromised safe. Surely, isn’t powder keg waiting go anything. can’t tell worried joint sanity, well one go in-person. I’m entirely sending kids back school it’s handled properly safely possible. fudge? Oh dissenting opinion might show up! Well India we're hold nation wide exams millions students next month count us yet. Yep, I'll feel safer anything approved November 3. 2.8 minimum. graduated 3.8 GPA grad post grad education. also happen author publications - one used worldwide.

I consider lucky at. every fortunate academic-wise. That's supportive different forms education - especially vocational schooling. last school year, spring, teachers followed administration's directions expected remote learning. everything told. Parents complained enough.

Now we're remote learning page we'll meet rigorous requirements teaching, giving lessons, homework, etc. administration wants prove parents they're control us making us come school work remotely. fact we're two weeks in-service home first proves it.

Oh, they've developed schedule requires us teach year-long courses semester. give PPE request! went ahead deleted comment obvious break free delusion. day think 1,000 national deaths contagious disease okay, proven psychopathic features seek professional help. long big number, trust cdc!!!! agree. problem is, actually unrelated reality, virus would reared ugly head full force, Iran-style now. fact falling over, medical system completely overwhelmed, entire country paralyzed, tells whatever truth matter is, least close they're saying. Misinformation knows borders, language barrier. Virus dropping pretty quickly Orange County. interesting country mobilize people 5 years fight world war, sending many young people overseas die, retooling factories make weapons... yet can't get people stay home properly 76 days. treated like war 76 days. tough two months.. two months. US already lost people World War 1 still taken seriously. /u/seanLFC making joke. People often correct ""who"" ""whom"" play name (which put caps).  Yeah thought too. guys weak unions need find new leaders vote in. leadership elected members, right? That’s teachers union works. district's plan is: teacher tests positive COVID, required go work showing symptoms. emphasize insane is, CDC's best guess people show symptoms still spread virus 75% efficiently show symptoms. Jesus Reddit seriously collection adult children. I'll take state example. glance teachers make average 45k-75k. Police make average 49-65k. Hardly double. Like place, there's departments pay crap others pay well. schools. 

But difference make police make compared teachers first place? police deserve get paid well? require masters degree? people deem educated enough deserve make good wage? 

Police also work shit tonof time too. sacrifice normal work schedule well. miss kinds important events due nature work. Got court date day off? bad guess who's going court. Get dwi 20 minutes clock out? Better hope he's nice drunk going hours. forth unlistable amount things keep police work want go home scheduled. 

And seriously saying police salaries retirement plans threatened? Police effected much politics job almost literally defended time new party voted respective jurisdictions. 

Which strong union important. Reddit hates unions actually teeth represent clients fullest. maybe police defended adequately because.... even know. Maybe human require fair representation something. 

Again, idea compare two. Teachers absolutely represented paid fairly already. whole bs rhetoric ""police get paid good shouldn't"" honestly hilarious. Reddit collection scream fair living wages someone like sudden fair wages, good union, job incentives evil. 

Truly source ""unbiased"" information place is. Hospitals federally funded? Sure.
No one buying conspiracy theory.
It’s wanna drag narrative that’s friend. 30% effective vaccine given 30% population still slows transmission rates ~10%. wouldn’t cal nothing. Given long US hovered transmission rates near 1, every little bit crucial “Shh! Transmission based hearing. we’re quiet enough, virus won’t find us!” wife's union polled strike Louisiana lose health insurance strike.

Too many people deal without can't blame them. I'm disappointed, fault. can't stand Americans say ""we can't lock like this..""

U.S used World Wars, twice.

Imagine lock form mobilization. Mobilizing everyone stay home much easier mobilizing fight Europe war. Build supply chain country easier sending food fuel across Atlantic.

The reason think is:

  sh\*t authority.

or:

 strong win 2 World Wars, still weak fight homeland. (which make sense.) Gave life fighting pandemic assisting many people horrific situation. warrior. May rest peace. Certainly valid argument one agree with. easier push advocate actualize. convince teachers 15+ years experience risk lot. That's hard ask, even seems obvious laws would change. Facebook seriously one worst things happen humanity.  Usually reasons money urgency go? hear lot places even take Americans anymore :( I’ve busting ass since March follow every guideline right thing like you. I’ve spent countless hours educating family keep safe. I’ve done everything keep kids safe. 

Tomorrow goes window walk first day PD. goes months months choices I’ve made help community prevent spread. 

I guess “it is.” really need justify football season, university seeing education window. correct! still fairly unreliable outside small window time (~3 weeks initial symptoms IIRC) accuracy/reliability seems vary quite lot different tests/manufacturers. definitely relying manufacturers data test accuracy (in Australia, millions 95%-99% accuracy antibody tests closer 50% checked them. Basically toss whole lot, many countries done same. still bother antibody tests they're unreliable)

There might usefulness large, population-wide testing areas high rates infection, even results taken huge grain salt can't rely accuracy antibody testing. hope changes, I'm banking it.

I mean average French horn costs used Honda guess one obvious answer. feel like person actually correct combine thoughts. Experienced/good teachers valuable make difference paying teachers more. 

But also lot problems need fixed saying good teachers fix everything part horrible myrtyr story everyone loves. Like teachers need supports (i.e. teaching emotional well-being great replace social workers councilors needed schools), teachers high workloads many preps decreasing productivity successful teaching, schools teachers responsible feeding clothing students communities, students' parents often work much can't parent much need to, even get started weird property tax funding schools US, school prison pipeline, systemic racism failing US infrastructure causing urban decay lack community space kids breeds crime, general culture school teachers US, total disconnect admin teachers, trusting listening teachers comes profession, list goes on.

Saying good teachers could solve problem discouraging af lot teachers struggle they're job 10 people getting paid half person end thinking they're good enough even though fault. yes pay teachers more, blame teachers everything recognizing many factors lead failing schools. blame students, often want learn product failing environment. hard learn worried surviving.

Hopefully made sense tired. Good night reddit 😪 Telling people jog stop eating junk food isn’t going make obesity magically disappear overnight. certain programs promote healthier lifestyles, like one Michelle Obama pushes nutrition guidelines schools, even guideline removed beginning year. [On birthday less. Come one, name 'cell-cycle' must know he's talking about... Governments hesitated mount broad containment response virus first emerged ended eight times many deaths per 100,000 citizens, average, compared sprung action soon after—or even before—confirming first case. &amp;#x200B;

I know that. I've done research background molecular biology. done yours? sound like reporting individual cases younger people dying part overall pattern. Read breakdown IFR age.

&amp;#x200B;

And reinfection? point waiting vaccine there? seem realise reinfection lead mildly symptomatic/asymptomatic infection second time round due T-cell response. Actually 30% 60% people already T-cell response they've already another coronavirus.

I think understand risk. stats lie. course, young people died virus (thought single healthy child died Covid 19 UK) tiny number (much like flu). flu dangerous children Covid 19. diabetes statistics adjusted age worst thing people realise they're diabetic. best thing obese actually lose weight get tested type 2 diabetes. I'm locking obese people can't lose weight. already well known obesity increases risk dying. 

&amp;#x200B;

As infecting older people, virus! mild viruses cause serious illness/death elderly. wonder attitudes different towards viruses... Massachusetts absolutely requires [from “Both masks significantly reduced number microorganisms expelled volunteers”

What studies?

Mask wearing isn’t required seasonal flu doesn’t R0 2-3 death rate 1%.

Asking people try lose weight perfectly fine, issue people already know health benefits don’t care it. Alabama vulnerable stupid Concurring Grilledcheesedr said. filtration better none. particles Covid hangs aerosolized, droplets, masks types beyond single-layer able filter air well. think mask that's pointless wear polyester face scarves. That's basically like wearing anything. 

In fact, polyester stretchy face wraps actually scatter virus smaller particles infected.

As mask test, I'd lighter test sprinkle salt. See blow mask. less can, air encountering resistance losing momentum mask face, want. Ideally, infected particles getting stuck fabric weave pass mask, like motorcycle trying go straight line forest. Surgical masks good weave thin heat blasted plastic layer. Breathable like polyester, hard penetrate like cloth mask. N95 similar fully filtrate air coming out, obviously ideal healthcare airborne pathogen. That's nuts. 

Wow. wow. district making teachers pick students, unpaid course. Texas sucks teachers, weak unions next zero rights Source? SINGAPORE - Tighter regulations constitutes mask worn also came effect Saturday (Aug 29), according notice gazetted day before.
It comes Ministry Health (MOH) reiterated Saturday makeshift face coverings bandanas, scarves neck gaiters used masks.
MOH's recommendation also line multi-ministry task force tackling Covid-19 pandemic.

The definition mask revised mean covering made paper, plastic textile solely designed worn nose mouth protection infection air pollution.
Previously, mask defined ""any paper textile covering designed made worn nose mouth provide wearer protection infections air pollution, excludes face shield"".
A mask also required touch wearer's nose, cheeks chin worn.

The previous legislation stated needed touch wearer's nose cheeks.

The amended regulations Covid-19 (Temporary Measures) Act come incident earlier August bus driver [refused allow man wearing neck gaiter Health Ministry spokesman said time neck gaiters bandanas recommended used masks.

[A study published Duke University United month looked 15 types masks found wearing single layer neck gaiter made 92 per cent polyester 8 per cent spandex worse wearing mask all.

The ministry said may perform well purpose-built masks may good fit around wearer's nose mouth made materials specific disease prevention.

""A mask worn closely completely covers wearer's nose mouth, without leaving gap mask face,"" ministry added.

Senior criminal lawyer Rajan Supramaniam said amended regulations mean clarity constitutes mask ""more decisive"".

Commenting possible repercussions member public caught wearing face coverings like scarves neck gaiters instead face mask, said: ""They reprimanded given warning, could prosecuted, means could fined.""

Regulations state caught wearing mask fined $300. plan track much can, right something relatively new interesting follow, time becomes widespread really matter track case, may change format display statistics data. currently unknown happen, reinfections common isolated cases? countries states continue genome testing reinfections become widespread change way count them? time tell.

Schools run private companies dollar bottom line, private prisons poor kids sent institutions profit number kids there, sent judges bribed prisons. Teachers kids going back school putting health care financial burden poorest families working 3 jobs feed kids.

And top outright saying old people would fucking GLAD give lives younger generations bitching health care costs older people (solving problem letting die spread virus...)

Ah fuck, I'm ranting now, tired little drunk.  Citations studies pandemic please. plethora data exist since it’s frequently discussed topic. I'm trying justify anything. probably fair all. point simply college going hand 100% failing grades. Hard stop. isnt right either. 

What 6% means dont code actually failed body caused death. listed covid. 

Just like got stabbed bled out, bleeding killed technically. case respiratory failure usually listed along Covid stroke/heart attack. wife already purrs spits hair balls goes me. Surprised take: “Something seems wrong this.” 

Informed take: “The System functioning intended to.” Appreciate kind words! Studies decades shown masks (other N95) don’t really prevent anything. 

Why isn’t mask wearing required seasonal flu?

How stretch asking people take personal responsibility health diet outlandish? know words I'm gonna guess I'm talking someone UK say I'm speaking ignorance. US, though, school performance free/reduced lunch populations easy correlation find. windows open.

I'm surprised that's legal?

What kids school class designated area play/hang school yard. allowed hand students classes. No-one wear masks (teachers students). someone gets infected likely hit one class instead whole school. said numbers quite low general helps course.

Good teaching little complicated that. worry online teaching sake, worry learning outcomes children.

As example one best moments last math class students separated pairs worked small set problems. group whiteboard, easy anyone else see they're doing. setup facilitates working together in-depth discussions kids reasons think actions make sense. Towards one group hit upon 'best' way solve particular problem, easy group explain everyone else.

Now theory possible replicate right tools, tools even it'd take time get used them. there'd still host issues, like older siblings take care younger ones, difficulty picking social cues, lack motivation school friends fun average student staying home, keeping attendance assessing who's working who's slacking much time consuming can't glance around classroom.

The average student school suffers lack motivation, social learning opportunities, lack kind learning activity experimental practical nature. think republicans think far ahead anymore? Comorbidities essentially health factors contribute death. Like obese diabetes. sad took us long develop ability? told keep door shut active shooter reasons

wtf Amd looking liability protection fuck Awesome. I’m Indian I’m called back work. often wonder idiots like even see world. can’t fathom stupid Masks prevent spread. Helping people’s heath helps decrease risk death. change one thing instantly, easy mandate. One impossible mandate, takes long time health benefits kick in. Also, even one obese, people would still die *obesity factor* supposed feel sorry people die Covid-19? Insensitive? one answered 'so?' fact 3000 people died self-harm.

A lot 3000 could saved political save them, isn't. Canada great, vaccine? know someone actually went this. Facebook plethora bullshit nonsensical garbage 'theories'. terrifying people exist. mandatory across Australia. People completely ignorant requests Government social-distance, stay home unless necessary go out, cross borders illegally, wear face mask (and properly around nose), list goes on...

You would think lost jobs due pandemic would jump idiots follow guidlines lucky enough still jobs, but...no.

The Government going support everyone forever. Money run out. everyone done back early March, would completely Covid-19 free.

(As long also stop flying infected cases every week without fail, is.) This. also, they've education disrupted, likely work jobs affected lockdown, job all, also likely live cramped unsuitable accommodation (or parents, even worse). voted? get that. long term sub sitting masters earning less $100 day, though? justified leads degree inflation. 

Plenty schools stopped paying extra masters degrees realize lot people getting really helping cause. extra piece flair apron. long masters holders jobs, though, it'll flow compete lesser positions. hate see people continually go debt keep up. conclusion virus fake

Don't fooled headline. think virus fake. think fear hysteria manufactured. fear hoax. 

And given we've over-reacted many pandemics last 40 years, one turning way. businesses shuttered virus kills predominantly octogenarians older.  come reddit antagonize people? get enough day job? That's true schools pulling different populations. live literally two primary schools road council estate. Schools publish numbers pupil premium, SEN, EAL children quite easily compare intakes. same. One Outstanding, one Requires Improvement.

Because wages paying teachers attract best. private school pay 50-100% job smaller class size attractive offer many people.

All things play part think teaching change views education. undoubtedly success stories disadvantaged neighbourhoods well. anything kids need role model champion anyone else. 

Wealthy neighborhood automatically mean better... comes different set problems like working much time read children combined attitude 'I'm paying job'. Bangladesh: First time? fair, statement perfect alignment public health agency Sweden. Didn’t nursing homes too?

Like can’t skimp things anymore. “Evidence countries suggests re-opening schools increase community transmission.”

part overall deterrence effort. says every day path forward data driven Deaths relatively low compared March. mean “much deadly”? Science based facts derived peer reviewed information tested repeatedly. Hahahahaha! China, specifically chinese government deaf criticism. think extremely hostile environment. change, better worse. example, china much transparent covid problems. perfect, transparent enough, transparent ever before. 

On negative end, china took lessons america's way suppressing muslims ""anti-terrorism"". Internally, several attacks happened western china government swiftly build re-education camps, taking lesson guantanamo bay. Terrible shitty stuff. 

India problems though. Caste system example. officially abolished, continues affect indian society today. indians treating fellow indians like trash. treat non-indians like trash. muslims also facing discrimination suppression: extremely unfortunate. 

The workers also brainwashed u think either. u see kind discrimination u displaying right now? ""Oh, black people savages."" ""The educated ones civilized rest savages."" No. worker class brainwashed. Billions lifted poverty lifetime. u started ur life finding hard proper meal government step help u, u love ur government?

It working class everywhere. believe government make lives better, support it. MAGA successful among less educated? usa government telling less educated ""it ur fault less educated"" long time. trump says ""it's everyone else's fault"" instead. brainwashing. made simple value judgement. Yeah... implications rapid antigen testing cheap widely available. then, cant really lower cycle threshold. missing? agree also think global misunderstanding taking precautions ones health taking precautions health safety others. even think world wide epidemic selfishness, think many mixed messages experts governments quick encourage public shaming cover failures. total lack accountability officials governments. want admit mistakes make message public blame. average person virus came nowhere given little credible information expected completely change behavior without question. lot people becomes attitude going treated like assholes, might well act like assholes.

The article says $569,000. Meaning could fined much. could also fined all. Essentially, charged something could lead fine convicted judge decides give maximum possible fine. majorly doubt get fined much. Dumbasses hope get Well don’t feel bad dropping KU? stupid... nice gave professors choice work home.  universities force professors whether feel like safe. real-world implications? actually read full article? Right now, immediate major real-world implications. Read it. cant lower cycle threshold testing available every day. Testing available every day cheap antigen tests widely F.D.A. noted people may low viral load newly infected. test less sensitivity would miss infections. problem easily solved, Dr. Mina said: “Test again, six hours later 15 hours later whatever,” said. rapid test would find patients quickly, even less sensitive, viral loads would quickly rise plead 5th brah Sure, maybe three weeks flies coach Hawaii wife, kids Mom 👍 depends. I’m Massachusetts, handling somewhat better states.

The state provides free testing regardless symptoms (generally longer wait times faster turnaround time results), municipalities. Otherwise, insurance (generally) covers cost test symptoms medical necessity get one (like exposed case, going surgery hospital etc). you’re asymptomatic, tests cost $130-$160 pocket, insurance often won’t cover it.

Yeah Christmas fast approaching (especially look retail calendar) 4 AMERICANS DIED BENGHAZI SHES STIIILLLL LOCKED UP! maternity leave, can't country anything right? postponed invasion 2021. Immunity baby may vaccine availability then, it’s probably going frontline workers at-risk groups first. I’m expecting able get around March next year. mess. hell going there? Fair enough, headline gross oversimplification frankly stupid. Came say this. honestly makes sick seeing everyone become complacent. Even people ""listening"" beginning pretty much stopped. continue learned virus actually come wet market, since wet market origin theory way back February? even good nutrition news anymore. why? Yep, good balanced article (especially liked 'We Still Need Cautious' 'We Need Robust Worldwide Discussion This' section). 

My quipe he's attributing lower effective herd immunity threshold (10-20% mentioned article) CV, ignoring places mentions still measures (social distancing, masks, etc) theoretically would also lower effective herd immunity threshold. 

My guess mix factors going on. Americans stupid?  Great. vaccination needed. can't. Political issue? even gonna touch that. nonsense can't even describe.

We tried it, work. fault, asked me. incompetence able prepare stage lockdown fault never even asked lockdown first place went it, say refused try. true, obnoxious makes want comply even less chance people like get pissed even more. “Not one person Covid” - CDC (Trump’s CDC, America’s) Yeah ekg always show heart damage. problems causing go far back way Putin.

Are intentionally lying misstate situation?

Or really clueless think simple comfort issue?

Because believe saying, know function, pissed tax dollars might wasted obviously educating difference death, permanent injury, comfort.

No one stupid pretending right now, they?  I'm sorry said kids. guess brain. something

That's addicts always say. record, done they're fun moderation (though I'd never recommend meth anyone). people use drugs moderation. suggest ""everyone something"" like beers week lines throughout every day logical.

Anyway, tweakers usually methheads way is, chronic users stimulant (coke, meth, Ritalin Adderall) tweakers too. acting like one. I'm saying sure *are* one, defending habits everyone it, posting online message boards drug choice, trying chat users like anything particularly interesting using (like hanging friends even working (not I'm condoning working drugs)), normal.

It's normal Pokémon. kinda weird *really* Pokémon. problem Pokémon interfere normal life. problem *becomes* normal life, point imagine almost everyone secret Pokémon habit too. repost article actual discussion since removal eliminated prior discussion.

Pictures angle deceiving. went beach yesterday never within 20 feet anyone else, looking beach looks like picture. beach one safest places be. Walmart 1000 x worse. What? Covid 50% mortality rate?  Indians claiming community spread yet? Remote learning work, thing learning from. get burned REALLY REALLY REALLY quickly it. remember Covid hit, one point taking 3 Online classes week.. got burned extremely quickly those.

So imagine kids feel can't see friends, deal ton online BS. Plus, annoyingly hard control kids get focus online class.

In person, least control things bit better, get better read room. That's essentially impossible Remote learning. say anything teacher thread.

With lying, prejudiced assumptions, coded racist terminology taken aback claim teacher say something. Next milestone: 1 million dead must child hasn’t experienced life I’m sorry truth one world owes stranger anything. People wearing masks feel like whatever it’s peoples responsibility make others feel comfortable inconveniencing theirselves. better solution government would good start. know, money. Well, elderly take one way trip mountain. basically though. different pharma company (equal larger size Biogen) work cancelled international travel then. False Equivalency. Lobsters never started pandemic live lobster markets US typically alot hygenic typical wet market. many viruses attribute bats compared lobsters? like Coronavirus conference. teacher spewing much hate without even able read evidence presented seemed pretty place too, bringing up. would ice cream? mean ice cream. No. said ice cream. God dammit fucking phone said ice cream. Fucking speech recognition bulshit!!! *Statistics anyway, started blasting. CDC amused that.  “we” citizens United States America voted office representatives help come together elected representatives help determine best overall path forward everyone involved. people decided within various jurisdictions handle pandemic way suitable live within it. 

The amazing part America free 1) vote representatives, 2) run office, 3) move jurisdictions representatives closely align beliefs.

That’s fair gets friend. 8 years later get Covid-29 people learn probably EUA, different general public full authorization make wrong. still right, refusing accept fact people like yourself, government fools pandering thinking political issue, caused guys able things correctly.

You right work. people like refusing even attempt try. Lemme guess: US, Mexico, Brazil, India Even partial population immunity still meaningful, context reduces R, alongside measures social distancing masking, could used control virus's transmission rate.

Complete eradication pipe dream, rolling back measures gradually immunity increases many gets infected (and hospitals get full, patients get treated etc) isn't. Fantastic news. 

I seen much coverage yet 6% deaths, COVID-19 cause Well he’s dedicated last decade life eradicating illness.

A PhD gives clout, billion. teams people working figure things out.

But hey, let’s ignore non-Docs, I’m good long revert back top doc turns saying things gates.  Age biggest factor, Africa extremely young young people (&lt;30) make less 1% covid 19 deaths They're way peak. schools swelling next wave.

Give month, make sense then. whites comments understand way feed 2 billion people make use everything. problem going away easy answer. China resources properly feed everyone. Lol. No.



It's simple mitigation. CPU drop temps install better cooling PC CPU become immune heat. drops temps took measures mitigate heat. That's all. Herd immunity absolutely fuckall drops infections. People going rub faces months writing wall yet again. Exactly. US cases 40k day, 30k day first closed schools spring, somehow time open back up? upsetting scroll far find information. It’s REALLY hard decision. work elementary school husband works long hours outside home kids choice go back. start 3rd week school (Florida) tell kids amazing. much better masks adults. Nobody complains. distance best can. stress hygiene washing hands DAY LONG. follow rules. Even kindergarteners really surprising me. honestly thought going shit show kids happy back really stepped up. hope continues.  Thanks link, check out. sure live, California things opened back going well far. masks enough, that's addition masks share work tools, frequently wash, keep social distance, take temperature daily enter building etc. Masks one part essential list things people need do. one saying quarantine healthy. Use correct words want taken seriously.

Who joking, take anything seriously requires anything anyone else.

Like making lives elderly disabled even worse acknowledge already are, little bit comfortable.

Pure evil. see. seems little place particular comment chain. Pakistan bad those. Yea, watching heart damage like saw Eduardo Rodriguez sideline player heart heals. Oil that's literally destroying climate. I've thinking thing. remember reading articles White House processes COVID test numbers, started mid-July cases started go everywhere Yes, also you’re allowed edit original title source. 

OP shouldn’t posted click bait article.  well, ""mass"" testing ......... 650 test. Thus, measures (such social distancing, masking, avoding mass events, etc) lowers effective herd immunity threshold (for R&lt;1). Partial (even 10-20% ish) immunity + measures = lower transmission rates. issue gradually roll back measures without many people get infected once. We're already seeing Europe. Watch got time traveler I’m sure fact it’s still hard get tested helping that. Numbers can’t go don’t allow people get tested.  realize doctor state senator video *on* youtube, right? really disingenuous, definitely unscientific. I've never seen scientist completely totally dismiss another, simply published. forgot link sources Another conversation went nuts attacking anyone audacity agree avery crazy racist thing said china. That’s regular middle east, confused singled palestine locked early, let single earthling since whole mess started. hear single case since January I'm sure much trust numbers. California may well say shelter place months/years vaccine. reopening plan unrealistic joke. small businesses save unemployment extensions/social program funding run lack tax revenue coming in. next? know I’m definitely going keep wearing mask store future flu season guess deaths don’t matter then! /s Unfortunately southern hemisphere winter increase COVID spread seems counteracted benefit lighter flu season. major temperate countries southern hemisphere, countries got community spread (New Zealand Australia) got away light COVID winter. Still lengths countries gone terms social distancing requirements immense, Victoria, Australia Auckland still suffered.

Argentina, South Africa Argentina suffered immensely harsh lockdowns. I'm asking special privileges, live life normal, lol. feel bad people at-risk. sucks, life fair. vast majority us risk destroy livelihoods? fair? I’d move heartbeat could.

why then? make mistake, exactly DeathSantis wants it, far subtle psychopathic version whitehouse

he sleeps fine regardless extra extreme suffering death he's responsible for, criminal liability, liability all, dream come true fucking dramatic. little sister fine, really enjoys time home pool. enjoys zooming home lunches. Speak us fucking ass hole. wonder look entire world dealing come localized excuse think one part issue might present people vastly overestimate responsiveness testing meaning outbreak begin tests even actual chance catch it. 

It's physically impossible positive test day infection. time incredibly high false negative rate start demonstrate symptoms, even begin demonstrate symptoms still alarmingly high false negative rate days symptoms began. That's swab test. Meaning somebody could asymptomatically spreading disease week even *weeks* single positive test comes back. info magically eye scanners return immediate unshakable results. Putting people incredibly dangerous situation testing twice week like tossing bullet proof vest firing squad unload them. Better shooting normally? Yeah. Better shooting all? Hell no. Lesson learn. Work work. used want work charities - big ones. full biggest waste space selfish people find. actually gravitate towards jobs ( mean management level) good enough private sector. How? humans bloody stupid, that's how. Ignorance bliss, expense others. Go goddamn park put infected Latinos Mexico's numbers African Americans Ghana's. put everyone calls Irish ROI numbers go almost 0! What? Yes, correct statement. talking reporting numbers. 
Your statement therefore strawman never argued people would “magically stopped sick stop testing” - that’s addition. 

Poeple don’t magically show statistics without tested. 

They would remain undetected, especially many covid cases mild completely asymptotic. 

With less tests, less people would detected get statistics.


Let demonstrate game: 
you 100 balls sack. 
90 yellow
10 purple

If dig sack 3 times chance get 1 purple ball given don’t put back sack already picked? 

If dig sack 50 times chance getting purple ball trying grab one 3 tries? 

Yes, course do. 

The number purple balls sack. 
But picks chances higher find purple balls. Hilarious think large corporations fall rather small, family owned businesses mean, ways yeah. electronics crazy expensive here, got us beat that. can’t go run? Trump said we'd get sick winning. right. comparison.

They aren’t exercising energy. energy exercise  Vancouver definitely not, pretty much new houses Southern Ontario do. much humid warm overnight west. hope involved miserable lives. really appreciate nuance here, thank comment! primitive, brutal society. oil they'd still living tents, using slaves. pity, individually good bad amongst them, good overshadowed culture, allow improvement value education. oil runs market dries difficult imagine Saudi Arabia ever making headlines again. lie bro, everyone free go country wanted (if enough people travel country, send alone), one way ticket, COVID-19 situation done with.

So....cigarette smokers Diet Coke drinking fat people ones dying... China needs catch nuclear flu. I'm 21 I've stuck customer service industry whole life. moved new house month ago everything piling up. state (WI) never paid single cent unemployment since laid old job March. Governor Evers fucking failure incompetence forced seek work. finally got hired place close home $9/hr retail job managers disorganized catty people I've ever talk to. feel like talk like I'm lost dog, irritating. I'm working getting there, hoping get re-hired job captioning assistant kind secretary administrative assistant. wear masks everywhere go fucked seeing many people act like nothing wrong. There's auto shop stone's throw away house remember looking window seeing 20 people across street gathered front single person wearing mask. even gotten 2nd stimulus check would much less stressed groceries I'd able afford PSU pc replace one died yesterday. excited finally 2 days working 8 hour shifts back back week luck way telling go fuck least convenient.

Sanity 0 months I'm wrestling little resources left.  See motto site: “Read Less, Know More” Wow shocking exercise good  UVC good sterilization you. Unless would like burn skin tissues. candidate vaccines covid19 listed 2 doses. Multiple doses normal vaccine.

All vaccines multiple dose too:

* Hepatitis B: 3 doses
* Diphtheria/tetanus/pertussis (bacteria): 5 doses!
* Polio: 4 doses
* Rotavirus: 3 doses
* MMR: 2 doses  Old news admit I've never trained marathon, maybe there's something mindset get, even Common Cold, seems insanely stupid continue intense training *while sick*. Offfff course. I'm convinced Missouri residents dont want virus go away. would love that.

Then talk reliability repeatability case counts vs time disease thats:

-less year old

-is exhibiting high numbers asymptomatic infected

-in state disease highly politicized


The function *positive tests vs time*. None numbers, particularly case counts, ever really reliable, least while. 

Numbers useful derivatives integrals active case data hospitalization numbers. people getting infected rate two weeks ago recovery rate considered. Perhaps percent positive cases given number tests would almost give information infection flat positive test integer per time. 

Case count per time eventually tell countries people. Good soundbite - teaching? childcare? think better realistic one's expectations. mean say like eating chocolate - mean going hunt job chocolate tester. People generally get work field good enjoy. allcomes present generation expecting get things young previous generations got them. think job enjoy. good probably enjoy vice versa also begs question hell mask wearing never adopted Western countries flu season.

Because western media used enemy imaging asian people decades. Masks something weird asians wear, regular people. Take breath. I'm serious. misunderstood article.

No, literally counting lab cases, article confirms that. need reread without looking prove right. says half states including ""probable cases."" Literally opposite proposing. wrong this. blinded anger emotion, can't even see it. Chill, conspiracy here. death gets attributed Covid, victim Covid. right-wing nuts literally insane.

I've literally never said there's conspiracy, I'm liberal. Stop putting words mouth making assumptions. helping case, making fool yourself. 

If death attributed covid, person *likely* covid. That's according *your* source, trouble reading. That's very, *very* different saying covid killed them. lung cancer, cold die, say died cold. 100% correct say died *with* cold, like said dying covid. tell us shit, it? Actually great point there. I’m fascinated things actually improving.

They testing less bypassing CDC data. Also places turning results all. Happening Arizona well. think another factor old homes prevalent Japan. Families take care elderly end. Shocked Pikachu face Also typo 1928, think thorough read would find mentioned 1918 after. 
I appreciate clarification. I’m mad downvotes, supposed tool individual discover mistake comment get judged pure data, understand calculations wrong. purpose doom gloom. diving cdc changes mean. No. They've handled COVID-19 well. people know hated softened views significantly well handled COVID-19. neither party rallies. 

It's quite spike August, would still say they've done excellent job. 

The opposition party ones obstructionist every turn earlier year said ""sunlight kill covid"". 

Don't speak us even here. Yea, idea guys study at, least country pick classes, get scheduled end semester beg good scheduling, unfortunately get entirety 2nd year. banks nationalized Bush’s watch. airlines need affordable rapid test. screen allowing people planes, people feel safe flying. sad ironic. bio researchers know enough meet online.

Because sales conference, research one. bribes thing age? Please elaborate..? two days show symptoms (if ever show) contagious, infectious period last 10-14 days following start symptoms.

Source: Contact tracer no, aren’t missing anything: crappy source conference covered amply elsewhere Rate change, rate hospitalization, rate death. broken age group, pre-existing conditions shown too. Would fun see data points us. Every family can't afford stay home parent, vast majority America. AIDS totally different. can’t make rules one disease it’s inconvenience rules illness. don’t get pick choose. guidelines consistent. even among different classes illness, count deaths way. 

We don’t count flu deaths way. Covid special? know count flu deaths - take actually deaths multiply get approximate. Comorbidities aren’t even considered flu that’s died. 
So Covid flu, count deaths manner? 

Also - it’s article. It’s op ed presented fact. It’s intentionally misleading. quoted text describes lengths actually go reduce spread virus short *not* getting together first place. SUCKS seems really alien (also reason I've hosted gatherings). right skip *really* want get cases enough start getting bk normal. People distancing less less. reason believe it'll lighter people ""on guard"", cause guard slipping. Mobile court? That’s really good idea situations like that! NYT data github bit. made glad didn’t live Florida, Arizona Texas last month. still struggling things getting better data seriously flawed. day get little closer believing really former.

I also don’t know anyone looks data think South Dakota rocking it. Counties border South Dakota lot cases South Dakota high rate per capita growing. wish people would talk instead making great example.  National secrets aside, company data trade secrets stolen Chinese done companies pretty much asking it. build facilities China expect behave steal data like they've done dozens time? point getting trade secrets stolen cost sort mass collaboration Chinese companies. One estimate daily infection count 830. caught 698, implies they're catching 84% infections. That's IIWII I’m pretty sure administration’s inaction, poor response, bad advise resulted deaths single governor. Getting control means reducing cases level tested quick enough, tracing done quick enough quarantine potential spreaders. thousands people confirmed every day imagine potential recent contacts impossible account for. Yet regularly do. sounds though don’t understand replication process immune response process. 

You qualified deny CDC’s stat. dont want easy come true number. said .2 percent. rate death calculated whole country gets covid cdc data says 6% people covid got jt . I’m saying cdc data right wrong, I’m actually againts basically said pneumonia healthy . got rush reading glorious victory Corona vaccine speedrun any% Hey..uh..do extra pencil? allies. Well duh.....Sturgis. post removal remove comments. post re-approved they’d there. Canada, I’d also guess don’t AC? Even Seattle, buildings don’t it, know it’s vanishingly rare across border Vancouver.

Where I’m originally Texas Arizona, it’s simply possible survive outside parts summer without occasional shelter. yeah, people stay indoors then. DeSatan mostly letting local governments enforce mask mandates. 

I really think masks help way think do. Look minimal spread protests cities masks mandated opposed not. Look infection rates cities like Tampa began drop 3-4 weeks mask mandates went effect. 

The state hasn’t done anything right, think it’s wrong say Florida done everything wrong. 

Look Disney. successfully created bubble NBA, still *zero* cases. extremely strict masks gotten lot heat making medical exemptions parks. system operates like foreign country, complete testing contact tracing. saying everyone run parks right now, they’re becoming increasingly safer local Publix. 

If locally elected school boards also power close schools, we’d way right track. branded article sponsored Unilever. Almost completely worthless information 10.000 London, 45.000 Berlin.
Crazy times indeed. Lol son starts preschool soon. require masks (except meals naps, cots spaced six feet apart), frequent hand washing, teachers cleaning surfaces every hour. gives hope enough keep safe. That's headlines work. Like instead ""Flu season alongside COVID may place extra stress healthcare system"" ""COVID pandemic get much much much worse winter."" wonderful current dilemma insurance Kaiser - so, can't go regular pharmacy get flu shot covered *but* they're offering flu shots area yet. options I'd otherwise eligible happening year locations fully/partially closed (main office work college I'm taking grad classes). recent trends amongst younger generations highly value public education, society government treat teachers level reverence US. 

Completely China Malaysia teachers considered level social standings doctors.

Do though? Malaysian teachers average, PPP adjusted, make less half teachers US make, China make almost quarter US teachers make. Oh, sure, what's agenda, bot? :) hundreds thousands tens thousands cases leads future include many, many deaths.  I'll home quarantine. count me. /r/whoosh don’t think calculating slope line (by looking it) even calculus lol US believe wearing goggles WORTH IT.

Great. wear one. God given right. 

I choose whatever want, God given right. 

I tell do. 

You tell do. 

Please stop embarrassing yourself. like meme RDR2, except brain Arthur looking for... HAHAHAHAAHHAAHHA mean mostly dangerous people 50

yes -- that's mean. that's' either sources quoted, words themselves, mean. stop training hard stupid Olympics. dont vote blue election, might another one 4 years. Well NZ Ardern things going pretty well, center left going full stalin. Ahhh yes abandon kids cause shit gets rough couple months. 

You teachers begin with. Imagine doctors pulled shit.

Grow hell up. uhhh.... that's even *the words quoted* says. Like, Yeah week 6 saying 13 feet confirmed testing farther. TV based training sessions? Yes, political prisoners Brazil. common sense CCP controls whole Brazil. bigger point used cleaning places like Airports luggage much like using UV light clean air comes vents office buildings.

It useful use safely properly. know different. him, way supposed be. 300 people arrested. protest, forbidden police, allowed protesters produced working hygiene concept. course idiots stupid follow rules cops ended protests. bunch racists brainless morons tried storm Reichstag. Pepper spray used dissolve them. said 300 arrested. revoke citizenship drop ocean... Everybody's father, grand-father, grand-grand father survived 1918 flu pandemic. Maybe, pessimistic. always save first foremost. Masks, stay home, stay healthy. God bless. seems baseless deny facts. Haha! true. I’m sure find way monetize it. Load full commercials, lots product placement within lessons..etc That's terrible education model lol idea life outside America makes anxious. death rate 1%, would classify swimming ocean deadly.

Of died swimming, 94% drowned due issues (leg cramps, waves, over-estimating oneself). 6% died shark attacks.

Would swim? agree statement, except 'last quarter 2021' timeline. Healthcare workers people front line expected vaccinated December 2020, vaccine rollout common man expected Q1 2021, entire country, least major metropolitan cities population density highest.

Just need hang 4 months, we'll start seeing light end tunnel. Well cases ok give bitter waters Ok let's double say 5% people get again.

That means 95% people can't. means could reach herd immunity eventually. That's saying comment. presence reinfection preclude herd immunity. Thank you...thank you! It’s shame Principal admin reckless. people normal looked calm attitude wouldn’t issue. person needs happen sanity children, parents teachers everyone needs wear mask safe...both possible!  never allow contact tracing locations tracked

[You already Ironic, it? poor woman called Karen refusing wear mask. flag masks. 

In Canada? It’s funny everyone thinks they’re expert teaching sat classroom. never knew half goes behind scenes teachers manage families’ needs, student IEP goals, paperwork, time demands, etc. I’ve doctors entire life know job entails see exam room. States, basing teachers pastime. Oh god, right! still belong herd simply insist believing imbeciles bleating rank nonsense! even comparing apples apples. What's point union then? booked collateral damage ...  district actively attempting keep everyone safe open tomorrow. students required wear masks times (they won’t allowed campus without one), use hand sanitizer time enter room, 50% student population virtual learning. students given laptops paper instruction minimum. It’s better effort schools I’ve hearing about. However, sympathize unwilling teach virtually. person virtual classes year, amount work doubled prepare scenarios. Despite precautions we’ve taken, still think we’ll closed within month much exposure kids can’t trusted responsible social distancing. It’s gonna interesting year. summary , see picture product  [Yeah. wow, mindblowing stuff. surprised see Bono part this. nothing suggesting case. Modern indentured servitude FL's numbers actually deteriorating then? 

[maybe, maybe, officials Florida actively cooking Reddit: need act fast early want defeat second wave.

Also Reddit: China locks entire city 50 cases? ChYNa lying!! ""As long people jobs properly""

Man, USA FUCKED. many excess deaths heart diseases flu season? know flu causes heart attacks heart damage? Well yeah get somewhere. Kim Reynolds massive piece shit. lol, ""the actual numbers"", huh? [You I'm happy wear mask seen evidence would make think necessary outside. would wear one, problem. Pretty sure is, I’m fine anything takes stop virus spread think go outside take walk. Outside less dangerous indoors. Massive prisoner's dilemma ""Mama always said, dying part life. sure wish wasn’t.” think spread much outside especially social distancing. believe there's much science wearing outside. Inside, definitely. ever even case know caught outside, yet? Positive tests US 4% world’s human population 25% Covid cases deaths. Hope helps! They're reporting data schools. DeSantis fucking numbers months. even reporting hospitalization numbers July, outbreak got bad could longer hidden. 

There reason assume anything different now. DeSantis keep covered either leaked he's forced give America fucked. Philly liberal, neighborhoods others. infection fatality rate 1% 65, would *not* classify deadly. 

Of died coronavirus, 94% comorbidity (or multiple). 6% coronavirus alone (CDC). Funny leading causes death far average way...

This going far. 

Your eye roll emoji convincing though! Nice little adolescent touch there! “Stupid stupid does.” wear mask hang around others well. prevent spread virus, rn many vaccines China developed far besides Covid? understand process behind? Process China show. don’t understand that’s process make product safe. I’ve saying thing. It’s frustrating could used months create awesome virtual experience. Instead, districts spent time money call safety theater. It’s damn show, nothing besides wearing masks helping anything. district started two weeks ago secondary students, last week elementary. already 90+ people quarantined dozen positive cases (that know of). isn’t sustainable long term. I’m terrified every time walk building. It’s true said it. it’s true. It’s remote teaching top everything else that’s breaking everybody, especially people near retirement. Nothing taken plates expected us ever before. makes throwing away experience masters degrees take much lower paying job look like fantastic idea. Massachusetts doing: people states positivity rate higher 5 100,000 must quarantine 14 days show current test result. Uninformed ignorant opinion: 

Fixed Obviously talking hypotheticals, imagine virus asymptomatic spreading period COVID19, lethality number weeks... downward evolutionary pressure isn’t going strong. Welcome 4th grade math, sponsored Raid Shadow Legends would need wear mask outside? Hey, want #1 something, might well stupidity. choice, fish lady. Orange county town hall meeting us. 
What bill gates!! jail!!!
And ugly lady wear mask like wear underwear things need breath. bully us time. It’s “we family essential” point glaring issues even work violations you’re suddenly trash. COVID-19 going suppress flu season, likely pretty substantially. International travel dramatically lower, percentage population wearing masks social distancing, hopefully people ever get flu shots.

Except Florida - Florida probably set flu records year. India also lot tests. doubt Pakistan Bangladesh much different India. Australia here, exiting winter atm. controllable actually, long people jobs properly.

If exclude Victoria, we're good. well, I'd remote learning frustrated PERSONALLY finance implement INSTEAD GOVERNMENT JOB THAT. inhale mouth, exhale nose. wrong accounts house? reliable statistics know Italy. say around 1%. So, totally harmless. 45% risk group would require something working done, political statements content failed already places.

I live island absolute fatality rate 0.001%. Virus hoax, something far sinister: “The American Academy Pediatrics publishes findings weekly and, comparisons difficult states report differently, data Aug. 20 shows Arizona leads nation 975 children teens hospitalized, 12 deaths positivity rate 17.8%.”

TIL: Florida kids 14 counted kids 😣 actual cases positive tests?  course article Bill Birtles brother in-law’s school shit plan opening half people town believed hoax. told could come live us didn’t feel like choose potentially dying going broke. He’s phenomenal teacher (was teacher year last year). put resignation principal acted confused made clear administration union concerns. moved us lucky enough find position taking things seriously. Fast forward school open month. got first positive case following protocols T. Meanwhile, previous school opened two weeks ago nearly 80 positive cases. Leadership follow make difference...not didn’t already know complete failure federal leadership deaths 180,000 people. contained cities could have, politics nice got way: I’m even saying 100% chance, owed hundreds thousands people dead tried. Whatever though, many people thread “but mah economy” types I’m wrong, don’t worry I’m charge anything, go days folks! Australians agitating 'decoupling', despite raking $$$ exports ripping international students.

A delusional country really thinks America's sheriff level global influence vs country 1.4 billion. Same. Literally describing life right now. school Internet need lot less teachers I’m planning become one open work suggestions career changing advice. ideas? I’m three times Teacher Year, exceeds 23 years evaluations, masters plus Ed, ESOL endorsed, bilingual/bicultural, decent tech like virtual teaching, I’m willing throw away much expected pension change. I’m also, like many others, deeply entrenched profession bubble teacher it’s hard imagine anything else. spouse friends were/are teachers. raised two generations teachers. passion calling. 

Any ideas? I’m looking online teacher/tutoring jobs, corporate training jobs (I’m great public speaker adult crowds awesome classroom better professional trainers ed companies sending county virtual teacher trainings.), voice work audio books (No acting background I’ve praised engaging read alouds). I’ve also considered collection gig jobs, like InstaCart. need clear $2500-3K month animals (left raising kids/hobby farming days) beef savings. husband TriCare he’s 100% disabled veteran I’m lucky need healthcare. cover mortgage basic bills there’s much left after. live expensive area don’t want downsize move eldest pets die 1-2 years COVID, likely around time. We’d planned early retire point, dramatically cut household expenses moving smaller home cheaper area, live pension mine kicked 65. also looking moving abroad. 

At 48, finally decent pay grade teaching going year banked away finally save retirement outside pension (sold stocks &amp; cashed investments swamped debt medical raising family two teacher income mostly debt free now). first two weeks bungled preplanning large district broken me. Now, there’s talk go back classroom mid fall virtual teaching phase mid winter. haven’t even begun time plan actual instruction school starts early Sept. last planning week booked professional trainings (mostly useless) individual meetings families. hardly keep peers working 24/7 still water either. years ago, fought two nervous breakdowns demands job let again.  ok natural selection taking away friends loved ones? keep us updated turns her? already has, nitwit. Kinda hilarious. Instead trying help students doesn’t seem responsibility adults. It’s wonder USA racist country dealt poorest covid see educational system failed completely. Whereas medical staff stay frontlines overworked protected people probably uneducated willing lose job forsake students climate. It’s quite hilarious read honest. guess manage indoor lines monorail etc. Haha the. subreddit filled bullllllshit. gets ridiculous day... going movie theater worse thing do- says expert..... wanna know else fit nose, coke, wife's pussys juices... China warned citizens start well. US there's reports numerous people sickened second time there's lack information officially determined fact infected second time.

There also seems almost lack find truth US well. bright side, I’m glad stupid people Americans people headed beach summer smelled cig smoke coming car front driving agree you, considering news recent weeks coming Putin (I personally longer ignore atrocities). It’s always table stuff someone else gets blamed news. already sketchy stuff going states, pandemic smaller bunch FB groups popped convincing people go protest lockdowns masks etc... worked - idiot creator didn’t know IP address easily visible different state FB groups traced back him. Pretty sure paid it. teacher, pissed good job summer break going staying safe. Now, thrown fire basically. classroom one smallest school. windows open. students told take masks get seated... normally one two remove them. 20+ students classes. told keep door shut active shooter reasons ""ventilation"" AC recirculates air room... course students wear masks correctly supposed social distance like should. 2 3 weeks I'm certain shut down. stupid could properly prepared virtual classes take inevitable risk many us getting sick...or worse. Florida Man becomes governor. two counties staff live improved, I4 corridor (explaining locals), plus NBA bubble WDW. There’s real reason assume parks increase spread point. It’s probably safer local stores. beautiful language, see. Constitutional amendment money isn’t speech corporations people may help Fair enough. I'll edit elaborate. PCR testing used caused needless drain resources (quarantine contact tracing) negative impact public health policy. 6 months pandemic US first confirmed reinfection? Sounds like good news me. Seems like reinfection rare. guess hoping everyone complete, permanent resistance getting infected disaspointed... Nobody dying. Guess what, people want lives back live like prisoner 2 years. Let stay home? Oh expect get federal response next January could see life return mostly normal end next summer PLEASE irresponsible. fire him. Sounds like knows they'll make life living hell going forward, he's planning retire. Idiot. **Aug 30, 00:00 (UTC+9)**

I think there’s argument made sneezing crook arm like normal pulling mask back on.  isn’t works. 

The link Chicago Medical Examiner archive data. see, lot people multiple causes death listed ie. Bronchopneumonia; COVID19. someone died got bronchopneumonia result COVID. person wasn’t going spontaneously develop bronchopneumonia without COVID catalyst.

RemindMe! September 21 Regardless said, take article article falsehood low-quality information? prone thinking experts everything. I've found many primarily experts working within academia. Perhaps, haven’t seen anti mask protests size here, ever. Usually hundred tops. Cuz r Red Alabama   still costs bit money. ... student dies 4-6 weeks... pneumonia? Heart attack?

See quote testing needless drain resources produced bad data comes public policy. good look also think viral load taken account. aren’t perfectly masked perfectly distant, might enough make deaths little less likely.

Sorry Ron, maybe next deadly pandemic. Oh jeez. teaching degree worked school system years. also toddler one-month-old baby.

My dad sent e-mail last week, suggesting apply sub I'll easily get job.

Could think response this.  According cardiac icu nurse know much better treating it, 22 pre existing drugs know help it.

Heck, look FDA plasma approval recent example sketchy political interference. would say Iran instead South Korea. means lot symptomatic people getting tested Please go back Facebook, eat shit there. Except feline Infectious peritonitis proven cure so...... blatantly misrepresenting statements now. Nowhere say PCR testing needless producing bad data. part lose reasonable people falsifying argument. Hes saying

1. data reported could used optimize contact tracing 
2. he's offering alternative hes quoted article saying, telling people low viral load get tested twice 48 hours. 

I mean, valid suggestion. sure feasible would given existing turnaround times fact need depend people schlepping testing center twice 48 Finally, clear, want change PCR threshold call someone low viral load negative. unclear article. simply want use information informative way guide downstream actions. Thank much! knew antibody test wasn’t specific wondering regular test. Well house bear canadian thing  Worldometers. Spain hasn’t reported cases today. highest number cases March 20. Based complete discrepancy numbers since can’t post screen grab app, assume 1 4 things.

But.... we’re unprecedented situation need less bickering show empathy. states unions sadly course correct. change fact widely reported. could easily year vaccine. ordered frontrunners: Japan track 521 million doses five different vaccines 2021, compared population 126 million.

Every place every thing gotten better get better every empirical sense. protestors wear masks /s it. Right here. Could explain someone familiar dynamics referring to? Yeah feeling weak. 104 temp feel fine Thankfully cats, I've never heard thing.

However, think point, people thought this. blame diversity. well! Stay safe there. :) assuming trump loses dangerous assumption. Another case Canada better America... lot chatter Vitamin deficiency problem COVID-19 morbidity, maybe he’s far off. John Wick 4. thought USA thing. lol make warm fuzzy though.

Righteous anger face austerity, cuts education, health care, unecessary deaths pandemic ect

...unites people empathy, compassion, justice.

These people feel unbrittled rage sense learn hate despise. Canadian seen people confederate flag masks. likely anti mask, used make passive aggressive statement. Appreciate that. doomed. Doomed. inbred idiots rest they've taken rest us.

A confession former teacher: kind bullshit school districts pull can't control outbreaks head lice (which, sadly, 99% schools America don't). Due ""confidentiality"", they'll send daily letters home ""one child's classmates may Covid"", parents gonna get tired seeing letters daily, start ignore them. Until, course, child infested. little Bobby also got grandma ICU. 

We learned **NOTHING** every pandemic last 100 years. Thanks understanding. hard. lot things created scratch modified work current environment. takes lot time technology always work way supposed to. get fewer 50 emails every day respond to. hybrid schedule kids building 4 days week, fifth day remote teaching. 4 minutes class disinfecting desks frantically. Teachers given three pairs gloves Band-Aids start year. That's it. No, making up.

We supervise group unmasked kids 40 minutes lunch who, although sitting desks 6ft apart, talking loudly laughing. told put masks back done eating, eat really slowly. 

As far requiring teachers building even kids - guarantee result long-standing shitty attitude many teachers. complain ""time off"" (we get paid days work teachers work tons hours outside ""contract day"") ""liberal indoctrination"" (Give break. Maybe ventured 15 miles house awhile little accepting diversity, too), God forbid get work homes top it.

Our small town 11.5% positivity rate yesterday. Many taking seriously. 

It's shaping stressful year ever. $flo grown$ bright side, Oxford found willing subjects human challenge trials. What's harm injected hoax virus? Went Ship lady's would constantly beat mens team. we’re sounds plausible conspiracy theory i've heard Would end way sister? almost like forgot spell Klutztown town klutz... forgot zero. bad. Lemme correct it. vaccines tend less effective people many high risk groups covid. expect vaccine different. People gotten used worse. I'll take Data Manipulation $500, Alex. music educator, tell people playing music thing least school :)

Best luck year gonna need quite honest world would better without individuals right vote, 3 days later going another 3k case corona this. makes sad people gone education system would think hoax. FFS hoax would require motive collusion governments ends? Economies destroyed, America roughly 1/3 GDP. majority people old ppls homes died knot know? Morgues undertakes full... collective governments want start selling Solent green? wtf wrong ppl. hope vaccine becomes available think sort conspiracy take Darwin Awards them, can't suffer fools. FFS go Wikipedia look Spanish flu!!!!!!!!!! appropriate precautions taken. Picture tells different story (assuming event title) good, maybe West trust chinese vaccine deep rooted bias, prejudice ideology. plenty countries, especially developing countries would happily take Chinese vaccine. Chinese Parma make tons money, Chinese government win loads political leverage lending poor countries buy vaccine.  group large overlap pro-brexit group? Also, seek rape, murder, aids, genital herpes. get done graduating way focus getting matricide patricide. needs parents anyhoo amendment money isn’t speech corporations people may help

So take EU route get bribed cushy job leave office. Representative democracy fundamentally broken level, time largest parties form synergistic corruption cartels big business media protect influence keep newcomers out. appears cost deaths lingering disability lower economic collapse staying closed.  Tough call. resume people know call shots take risks. dog-eat-dog baby, hope survive. went Yale undergrad Harvard Law. naval officer became JAG prosecutor. worked Gitmo deployed SEAL Team One Fallujah ""advisor"". fundamentally lacks empathy intentionally malicious, stupid.

I read nation testing 10x higher California. reading wrong? wonder work patients claim “ Masks pussies”? USA? PLease tell are, move there. I'm sick draconian measures NY Tank af got see. \*sigh\* many pandemics like one lived through? agree!! Also I’m teacher well share ur pain. I’m pretty scared stepping foot back campus even hybrid model. believe remote teaching best way keep everyone safe वहाँ भी संक्रमित करने के लिए सस्ता! Fine jail (I’m US Dumfuckistan medical professional). penalty load bodies trucks. It’s fair don’t really think actions impact. always way. internet cover it. Usually ignored died intelligent healthy people went way. extremely easy survive lot people would died given platform suddenly it. tried prayer? wonder ever works? know humanity lasted long. read sir. confused ignored you.

Can teacher's pet upvote. Thanks. Dat got nose air God though stupidity least contained US... painfully wrong assumption mine turned be. guess social media. species fucked. There's animated maps show major centers infection. Based reported cases peaks, would say:

China (Hubei) Iran (Qom) Italy (Lombardy) rest Europe US (Northeast) Russia US (South &amp; West) South Africa Brazil title two different people surviving two different pandemics. Russian thing could conspiracy well... middle 

of hurricane season please stop repeating 70-80% thing MARCH KNEW ANYTHING COVID. recent estimates 25% - 50%, none really that. current situation job right barely reflects teachers signed do. 

That said, volunteer sub? company doesn’t think family, I’ve worked small “like family” places tend go beyond benefits, especially insurance.

Reconsider stance, 30s problems start happening. health gets worse out. hate trump hate every single white people? imply that.

There literally infinite spectrum options aren’t “do thing did” “do nothing.”

If needs flexible willing change mind, *shouldn’t repeatedly announce plans stretch many months future.*. could easily announce short-term plans instead important take stat context. California populated state, expected sheer numbers cases would high compared states like Oregon Louisiana, etc. like Opposite Term!!!. I'm everything opposite entire term. Ya guess know optimist thread. Ok, sometimes they’re entitled jerks too. Every teacher kids bad attitudes they’re lazy. It’s super sad. teach ass ones make dent. It’s easier blame others look accept problem bad attitude.

A bad experience excuse completely disregard educators. Stick like pin cushion. DAMN!!! Interesting. Australia, school always 9 3, 'Rona made schools rethink, changed 8 2. remember 6 12 Mexico 00s, that's weather thing. [just gonna send naming beer Corona... oh wait.  Another factor - NY always strong union state. could even say strongest considering former Mob influence unions, go that. Many states super weak unions collective response stifled state gov't (FL mentioned another Redditor). result decades archaic horrible education system stifles emotions critical thinking. We’re finally starting get things control.

Are they? Worst part risk spreading others. just... can’t even... damn...  would like introduce president United States bullshit smear basis facts. Testing Pakistan ""much worse"". reason looks like demand covid tests plummeted prevalance virus plummeted result Pakistan flattening curve. 

Test positivity rate Pakistan past weeks consistently [hovered around 

Which means Pakistan fact right amount testing. Wow, really understand covid, study cite getting debunked place almost double take meeting asked parents “try” make sure children sent communications teachers reasonable hours. Apparently, teachers receiving emails 1am morning students. Elementary students. Like, heck child time period? child bed 9pm. felt sorry teachers. don’t even bother communicating 4pm. lives too. Geez. Except theory validity. U.S. intelligence services confirmed Russians really this. theory, real crime, evidence proof. 

Don't try equate wild, ignorant conspiracy theories actual, factual things really happened. Hey there, wanted say fuck piece shit. Thanks. Part leader ruining credibility announcing long-term plans repeatedly known can’t finish

This implies better anything enact long term plan know whether absolutely correct, can't know choosing.

It fluid situation many things changing. that, approach needs change sometimes. perceived best May best today. leader willing change strategies great leader mind. late K-State already fucked KU toe thanks sororities Lol can’t. 

I’m belief people super critical education bad experience schools. Problem see babysitting component don’t see work actual work. Basically going myriad discussions we've already phase 3 human studies. Kind reason phase 3 takes upwards 10 years.

Now could get incredibly lucky something 80-100% effectiveness...but general, know get data people getting exposed virus able fight off. lot vaccine candidates 30%-60% range first iterations...only discovered via phase 3 studies. (this due diversity needed sample population, difficulty confirming vaccine actually job)

Now something happening somewhat controversial younger people volunteering purposefully get exposed order accelerate phase 3. Something could help tremendously. (however also risky accelerated testing something deadly COVID...and young people getting sick pre-existing conditions too, quite understood yet) curbside pickup? grocery stores offer either free little. cool face covered snot day? Good Lord.  Everyone good. Everyone get accepted PhD, makes ,get diploma apply job *excellent*. 400 applications per job posting. fact. CDC longer trusted source. become politicized.

Slightly high blood pressure? Condition. Slightly raised glucose blood? Condition. Stubbed toe? Might condition well, idk.

Poor guy shot chest.

Bullet kill em?

Nah, blood loss.

Gee, that’s unusual 🤷🏻‍♂️ Wasn’t heart problems. Hopefully problems turn error too. Sharing fact official report CDC? add even would last, mounting evidence mutations occurring.

I like scientific statistical evidence ignored since world learned Corona mutation. Wieners I'd offer respite US, but....uh...yeah. We're worse. Exactly, empty out, use every viable organ help living. burn party. good redditor. Thank you. first  happened today Berlin too. 👀 real people lost years decades life would otherwise lived, you’re disgusting. Thank saying this. Reddit pisses sometimes. important people know.

This end. Would listened weirdo preppers now. Viruses mutated COVID. statement umbrella statement viruses. COVID different regard? No. didn’t culture viruses, it’s unlikely actively replicating. Korean CDC also found happens adults 3 months (continuing shed non-infectious viruses), could good news kids shed virus 1/4th time, perhaps infectious window equally short. People need stop spending thousands funerals. bankrupt say goodbye looking corpse? Cremate remains wake. Save money survivors.

This old foundational formula pertaining fluid dynamics, old guideline proven way even time. Carl Flugge studying details virus particles propagate, even know virus caused respiratory illnesses studying. literally trying convince people exhaled gasses related reason catching cold happens often proximity sick person, established fact time. time figured viruses particles, Carl Flugge dead.

It's $15 pack 50 masks. old died covid rather covid argument. 

I mean virus people initially thought God's punishment China cracking religion. 

oooo got much sulphur, morgues operating nonstop! They're hiding deaths! 

And everyone's like thing overblown. ""They die getting shot! died exsanguination bullet abdomen!"" coast cruise ship on? supposed go ports Queensland probably able use argue refund.

Less 10% nation wide guessing till now. cases projected peak October.Only metros hit far.Rural india starting now.  people drop dead COVID19.

They get hospitalized die pneumonia/organ failure/etc. Bit fauxpology there. Basically every zombie apocalypse ever vaguely remember Adv. Higher biology weak immune system’s white blood cells carry antibody info would die post-infection, think wild exceptions would care believe liar tells changes it? Ignoring part I'm guessing:

""Britain preparing revise laws allow emergency use effective coronavirus vaccine fully licensed shots meet required **safety** **quality** standards"" district, ever since classified essential workers, admin decides want us leans favor community anyway appease them. even go full remote, teachers required entire school building ""we essential"" It’s funny it’s true They’ve increasing restrictions weekly. regions saw outbreaks July already stopped exponential grow either stable decreasing. Check facts. 

Measures: meetings 10 people, face masks mandatory public places regardless density, massive test campaigns incidence suspected high, smoking banned public spaces unless literally alone away rest people. Face masks mandatory shared offices. Etc. Direct link; Got United Healthcare  
*""That's waiving certain out-of-pocket costs (deductibles, copays coinsurance) plan members. means $0 copay primary care specialist physician services, well covered services September 30, 2020.""* Successful counter measures. idiots small horizon can't see happens everywhere else actually believe virus exist, bad often hoax get microshipped Gates.

You love seeing people dying ignorance. FlU!



Who hell wants catch flu?


Wear mask social distance. keep getting huge daily numbers, wonder point herd immunity start slow spread covid India? sure sarcasm... Covidnado!  No, needs violation civil law plaintiff win suit. decent judge toss case long trial civil law violation can’t justified. It’s timeline keeps pushed further, inevitable delay rolling vaccines, questions vaccine effectiveness keep feeling optimistic. swear god recently 2005 democratic congressional delegation. :( Los Angeles, California cases cases per 100,000  cause problems. Systemic racism obvious cops power act it. Rlf-100 seems point right wont get eradicated, least anytime soon. get 90% positive cases arent transmittable statistic? true r value would 0.1 true anywhere world impossible quarantaine elderly.

Sweden wanted that, can't done. Old people can't avoid contact everybody. Exactly came say. go fine expected paid, expected essentially ban country without formally send message everyone else. That’s funny. district, even teachers “teaching remotely” school.

Yup. It’s moronic. gotta look excess deaths though. Nordic countries measure deaths accurately, unlike lot countries. US, example, ahead Sweden quite time comes excess deaths. strategy also accounted deaths first, similar amounts end. saying gonna end like that, that's they've saying might happen. agree him! doesnt help abysmal amount soul-crushing news last months.

And yet people almost taking glee it, love proclaim doomed stuck like years come. agree there. far complicated real life. Obviously hospitals stay open, I’m sure you’re places handled better (so far) others.

I worry school opening, spread like wildfire Canada. see people work, price tag school reopening “safely” CERB could extended another three months cover first semester. People making working sad is.

Again, without social supports, course can’t slam country shut, people work. Bars, water parks, restaurants, schools (can online), business open. It’s global pandemic. grow deal it.

I appreciate scientist comment, you’re attentive observant person, though scientist, obtain degree science field I’m sure largely impacts thought process.

I would however propose viewing situation thing saying “shut er down!” Unfortunately level help governments need offer scenario unpalatable many.

Again, maybe I’m idealist, could dealt way hundreds thousands need die, all, SARS gone, Toronto, one hot spots, locked shit down. successful people isolated immediately, everywhere, threat gone. chance, that’s I’m saying. I’m sorry offends you. Also, university professor still allowed ""mull retirement"" directed students intentionally spread deadly disease? one signing sub, hazardous working condition, intermittent per diem pay doesn’t even match minimum wage.

My district put call +17 bus monitors. *one* applicant. Like, it’s one year position, split shift, pay $1.5 min wage. 

Yeah. It’s gonna great year. many die due Sturgis? Would attendee okay even one died? One patriot brothers? Sad   friend sharing social media CDC changed 6% deaths solely Covid, I’m woke enough him. friend sharing social media CDC changed 6% deaths solely Covid, I’m woke enough him. they’re afraid sending students home losing money, going get legit trouble open things pandemic going? ridiculous anecdote. I’m glad you’re healthy, let’s leave experts declare flying safe blame everything one demographic. Here’s another anecdote. partner got covid back March, extremely careful since well official action government. Fluffy President! almost predominant economic system proving incapable sustaining health well-being populations subject it. cousin, RN nursing home, tested positive last week sent kids school regardless. I’m high school English teacher feel scared trapped. Doctors, firefighters...they signed heroes. sign hero. signed safely educate children. drafted last week haven’t told parents. hope I’m one lucky ones survives this, I’m counting days we’re sent back remote. wife one Roll tide Yeah, they're infected places importing people would improve percentages. guess. Way come. Also lot big districts reopened August 24th, it’s matter time cases significantly spike. unproven accusations

I never accused dude anything (aside preaching me). talking about? No, even closed videos I’m sure it’s posted lazy scroll down. truth 6% thing? part plan. Stay safe, friend! even live FL fucking hate Ron DeSantis county 78 per 100k still ranked 300+. I’m sure there’s counties it’s 2nd/1st leading cause. to. think many rural people moved country ""get away people."" one's people problem. Clearly testing causes virus! 3 feet work too. block day students take mask socialize. quit fuck that. claim muslims anything islam told us smh It’s almost taking seriously key success. Weird. Ok class, today going talk first monkey president.. begged mother retire, said couldn't; saying years though. going back work in-person, high risk poor outcomes across multiple categories get COVID-19. wears mask social distances, says, definitely much lax am. I'm preparing mother going get really sick and/or die fall. Heavy judgments something a-symptomatic person could easy do. may kill anybody. 

And still don’t know end herd immunity anyways. migrants, several displaying scars backs, claim beaten guards hurl racial abuse “We eat tiny piece bread day rice evening. There’s almost water, toilets overflowing. spills short video clip smuggled shows several rooms covered filth overflowing squat Several migrants said rounded homes various Saudi Arabian cities placed camps. Others African refugees war-torn Saudi Arabia deeply stratified race cast. African migrants enjoy legal rights many complain exploitation, sexual racial abuse Testimonies gathered NGO say Houthis killed dozens Ethiopians forced others gunpoint Saudi border. Saudi border guards fired fleeing migrants, killing dozens more. 

Heartbreaking. Migrants refugees treated abhorrently government citizens one wealthiest countries earth. ""My crime leaving country search better life."" Also, lot schools FL pushed reopening two weeks started August 24th remember Georgia, people impressed reopened numbers go up.

But fast-forward two months chaos. we're seeing days 100+ deaths (and half population Florida). hope don’t buy single thing pocket. unpopular, pretty sure illegal unconstitutional, unfortunately. Trumplogic finest. get decide. people seem give shit?

Because now, Teachers able ""make do,"" making seen better unemployed. 

Now things gotten bad teachers refusing, gets attention.

It's every revolt ever. Things bad while, finally, passed point better risk everything. Good luck, america used great nation it’s filled morons running country ground. wear n95 day. think principal's decision something ask Monday faculty meeting. gotta know made bs rule Duh. deadly. contagious diseases want spread most, they're deadly.

And still, 80 10% death rate. guy looks really healthy, especially age, would like 1%. don’t anyone directly blame it’s easy ignore. It’s faceless, directionless, invisible enemy realistically would take fairly dramatic changes lifestyles stop. death individual one, single entity killing person army virus. don’t blame building crushing person twin towers, blame terrorists flew planes clear cause effect. attempt blame China, administration, health officials, isn’t whole lot proof China built virus launches conspiracy theory territory, blaming admin health officials like blaming managers told people go back offices building wasn’t hit yet. blame extra lives lost, sort nearly much blame terrorists planes. problem is, terrorists blame. It’s wildfire created lightning.... house tragedy, considered unavoidable. Thats happens science. literally scientific method action. fucking cretins base knowledge understand happening. accurate testing president pigshit want look bad. numbers skewed way want be. gf actually slightly worried virus me. Best luck situation, really feel like younger generation, grew overloaded information internet tv, therefore pretty much tune go day till something smacks right face, older generation grown cautious surroundings combine reactive media they’re receiving sometimes react necessary, leaving big gap younger generation thinks older generation bunch paranoid reactive people, older generation thinks younger generation uneducated stuck ‘invincible’ mindset even care dont get yet think know dont get it. Got it? Btw, went digging DR.DK news clips day reported quote ""live feed"" can't linked directly to. Here's screen, since doubt coverage previously. rotating shifts hospitals community service. due test rates high positivity high? delhi shout crosses 7 8 per cent double testing. They’re trying everyone catch football season presume. approve bumper sticker. hand sanitizer made distilleries

Why considered odd? big tanks, distilling towers, fluid-handling setups. Yeah I’m never going back full time office..   approve number sticker. Nice Smash Mouth concert? position board directors reflection professional status COLLEGE. job tied directly college, WOULD BOARD!

Here members board regents University Kansas. professional status people relative university? think can't read, can't logically deduce shit?!

You understand university board looks like. company. believe read, stupid realize ignorant of. I’d like agree won’t celebrating anything orange shit stain going win again. Oh shut old fuck. done PCR ten years, back then, set number cycles start up, let run continuously. article makes sound bit like could stopping starting cycle check base threshold found virus, seem reasonable.

I agree 40 cycles seems bit high, think sensitive setting made lot sense initially given samples acquired. idea virus distributed nose, transferred swab tube, assume sometimes person positive swab misses virus. Yes could probably lower cycles, could mean people genuinely early incubation?

The ""solution"" proposing - test people 6-15 hours later catch virus replicated seems really logistically difficult. sensitive test asking people isolate abundance caution versus come back run different test - cheaper easier former. 

We're barely managing get handle testing is. data would amazing, able quantify viral load would ideal, point yes/no manage, see sensitive test bad thing. stage anyway. Geez. Disgusting. Yes, many science deniers scientists. That's what's made confusing.

First off, realize contact traced outbreak studies scientists U.S. first said usual catch phrases ""no evidence""/""purely circumstantial""/""inconclusive imperfect"" citing regularly HAPPENED APRIL EARLIER. one happened U.S., infamous choir practice. article discusses conclusions made Asian countries U.S. time - one little zero evidence surface WHO, CDC, Koch Institute, New England Journal Medicine ignored denied asymptomatic fucked aerosolized can't, wildest imagination, comprehend mental gymnastics needed reach conclusion virus fake. dead bodies. think people paid actors?

Most ""hoax"" crowd believe this, dumbest dumb actually think covid exist. article implies, ""protests"" (including US months back) center around people believing overreacting virus (""it's flu"") leaders/politicians taking advantage making power grabs. said, still pretty moronic - mean imagine history books, ""in early 21st century, extreme leftist socialists rose power across world ushered downfall western civilization *checks notes* closing... bars making people... wear masks. QUITE full-blown retarded actually believing sars cov 2 exist. I'm waiting local mask mandates start lifted numbers look better. took two different votes city commissioners pass mask mandate, last 30 days time. first time passed, one dissenting commissioner. vote next month, two dissenting commissioners. matter time city declares MiSsIoN aCcOmPlisHeD decides let mandate expire/vote down. Oh, nothing really there, either, graduated 2008. originally wanted get communication design major, time transferred there, taken gen eds already courses offered lower pace, would taken much extra time finish went fine art route. one 3d modeling class time, guy taught actually legit industry guy, non-traditional classes available CD students enrolled. self-taught 2d digital art (I ran Mario website, lmao), learned model SMU’s grad program video game development, went KU. 

If program game production now, I’m actually interested looking it, curiosity. It’s still hard people area find path game industry I’d love see students opportunities expose kind art. It’s also one things makes nervous, there’s experienced industry people PA, learning inexperienced people huge fail wrong directions, focus, incorrect advice! pay livable wage instead? much info share...remove step sister part. Exactly, school gives every student Chromebook. rural area internet end last school year go virtual set buses around town WiFi. definitely done. still show something camera audio computer streamed phone tv another device. think also consider excess deaths caused indirectly covid19 due overwhelmed hospitals, unemployment, etc. 

It’s probably even shittier consider possible deaths reduced lockdown like traffic deaths. God awful When's USA going impose sanctions SA? bet China still Covid 19 problem. make easier new teachers find job? better parent mine. live dad since cheaper us, saved money could work unemployment cut off, decided go back school job apparently go back he's gonna kick 🙃🙃 Look, wanna scapegoat, that's fine, it. plenty threads world news way back heads deep asses listen.

Staying topic scheme, really bad call think more. time virus comes say, venison wild meat Alabama, gotta pay

$1.4 billion China
$1.3 billion India
Not mention rest world, assuming $1 test.

Even QE, that's gonna pass Congress House.

Not mention past pandemics like one 2009 started mostly us. One could even argue education we’re mess created government we’ve electing decades. fingers crossed. partner work schools (I’m clinician, partner’s preschool) we’re realllllly hoping isn’t college based surge trickles back population. don’t want get sick :( Huh. go school? Give dude. 

While made good points, idea talking comes education: school metrics comparable private public schools ( private schools show much better public school using public schools grading rubric, therefore getting tuition using sales tactic), teachers rated educated, teachers live ( yes work jobs take additional responsibilities school extra pay) generally educational works whole. 

There teaching methodologies, psychiatric emotional tools determine good bad teacher.  us big meetings trainings via web video (and years) puzzled this. agree person learning much better transitioning inline learning hard all. see unwillingness inability learn it, especially collegiate level. Professors technologically illiterate bare minimum yet students paying full price. isn’t guarantee that, matter said. written current laws that, you’ve teacher last couple decades, well within realm possibility. 
 
And would ACLU anything it? They’re civil rights group, workers’ rights group fucked. Stay inside. here's latest case/death charts ranked 16th terms per capita deaths, 51.57 per 100k population. Moving up! reading headline bad idea. Sorry, don’t think Hitachi makes UV-C add on. really proud Wisconsin's Governer Tony Evers. plans set put Stay Home orders fairly quickly. recently put place mask mandate (he said wanted earlier, certain would sued would brought 5-2 conservative majority court. think court 4-3 conservative majority, hoping one may different due different pressure.) also uses ""Holy Makerel"" unironically.

And legislature happened decided sue could get state open early possible. everything schools (gotta love footnotes) open up.

I'll see find podcast something link sure actually telling truth, may bit due long ago happened.

Even tiny island nation. guess everyone lockdown hard house arrest, slip thru cracks NZ... would never understand point putting /s sign sarcasm. sarcasm explicitly say so. God reddit worst. qualified talented administrators tell suck covid risk, must fear losing - either leave there's 10 line do.

Hmm. I'm really sure. know latter -- people actually want building sub positions. lot work pretty poor pay. Could former. principal took different approach reached phone essentially beg stay help since admin second year. really good relationship kind rare comes administrators teachers. 

I'm also sure ""FastTrack"" masters program is, mine person took almost three years finish. say hard...but fake bullshit either. Kids Kinder 3rd grade adjusted rather quickly easily remote learning. school gave ipad chrome book. apps pushed devices needed like zoom, google classrooms etc. easy.

Unfortunately sounds like byproduct FastTrack masters programs everyone wants offer teaching grads days. everyone advanced degree, noone advanced degree.

I said original post different eye something better qualified talented administrators tell suck covid risk, must fear losing - either leave there's 10 line do. One big reason teachers required buildings teaching remotely equity special ed teachers. us SPED teachers students us 5 days full time even rest school system remote many students really can’t distance learning. Also, states terrified lawsuits parents IEPs aren’t met.

SPED teachers exact teacher unions, teacher salary scales won’t get extra pay working person. equitable put lives line regular ed teachers get teach comfort living rooms. Also, students gross- many require high levels personal care tolerate masks (which aren’t required due disabilities). Many school districts requiring teachers work classrooms attempt level playing field. 

In state, new guidance urged district allow teachers bring personal children classrooms children considered part higher risk group students (special ed, ELL....) getting first priority person teaching parents work. However, IMO makes special ed staff students even vulnerable COVID people building, janitors need clean rooms used person learning potentially takes away PPE resources could using keep students safer teaching person. None mandated many districts said fuck (either teaching remotely rooms allowing children them).

There good answer issue. know salty getting bitter day regular ed teachers fighting go think buildings aren’t physically safe need childcare without even stopping think small % school person either way. It’s disheartening know Union essentially ignored it’s best students. don’t teach will? time, life put jeopardy Karen teaching English living room supposed equal school district’s eyes!? People think:

They'll immune get it
That get bad 
It'll like bad flu life goes 
They think they'll serious medical repercussions like organ damage
They figure fat heart disease they'll survive
They see figures 200k dead can't really wrap heads around (so rationalize number inflated 199,000 old people, sucking Social Security teat probably lived long anyway)
They believe non-whites get die they'll fine white
They figure they're healthy probably get anyway
They believe God save them
They believe hoax perpetrated Deep State, Dems, rest world make Der Trump look bad (or number batshit conspiracy theories)

And more. many excuses I've actually heard mouths friends, colleagues, family, grocery clerk, bank teller, nurse doctor's office more. Even teachers.

Honestly, blame teachers retiring quitting, wish best. know stand front lines watch politicians, misguided/misinformed/willfully ignorant parents - options- send kids face face school big, poorly designed science experiment see many get sick die. got hit fast hard beginning tests even ready. Horrible happened there. majority country comorbidities. Also hadn’t gotten virus wouldn’t died.

Asians started wearing masks months ago even early last year everybody made fun that.  good, almost definitely rereleased next year safer go. Thats edicts exclude children, pay attention. self-centered can't even look past self righteousness? I've tracking metric while. US well course jump several places next 30 days. US Brazil 10th 11th ages way behind anyone else they've caught lot ground front runners Brazil nipping ahead US there's one even cost behind US now.

The US Brazil gaining around 4 deaths/million every day whilst countries table static. five countries ahead US within 60 deaths/M. countries remained static US would overtake 15 days.

If continues September Brazil US 5th 6th worst death rate end Sept.

Although think US death rate slow September enough see US overall jump several places minimum 7th.

India's bad population large it'll need death rate 5,000 / day match US current death rate/M. 2% Korea's cases either reinfected relapsed end April... Here’s shit ton research mask ineffectiveness:

Furthermore, benefit wearing mask, blocking power droplets aerosol particles, benefit wearing respirator (N95) compared surgical mask, yet several large meta-analyses, RCT, prove relative benefit. Masks respirators work.
Many potential harms may arise broad public policies wear masks, following unanswered questions arise:

• used loaded masks become sources enhanced transmission, wearer others?
• masks become collectors retainers pathogens mask wearer would otherwise avoid breathing without mask?
• large droplets captured mask atomized aerosolized breathable components? virions escape evaporating droplet stuck mask fiber?
• dangers bacterial growth used loaded mask?
• pathogen-laden droplets interact environmental dust aerosols captured mask?
• long-term health effects HCW, headaches, arising impeded breathing?
• negative social consequences masked society?
• negative psychological consequences wearing mask, fear-based behavioral modification?
• environmental consequences mask manufacturing disposal?
• masks shed fibers substances harmful witnessing bryan fargos vision future (aka Wasteland, Fallout) real time now.

You definitely low priority organ transplant recipient still using drugs. that's punishment - scarcity organs, go people likely survive healthier life afterwards.

However, want argue scrap nationalised health care people accountable actions - sweet. start treating smokers, drinkers, drug users, obese people. Would save absolute fortune :) CONCLUSIONS

How long take virus infecting someone person becoming spreader? way written makes appear happens span hours.

People desperate jobs, fucks lowballing potential employees hard they're *still* getting anyone. ""proven"" genetically sequenced two different strains (to rule left-over original infection). 

Other cases heard go process, proof reinfection.  frozen fish packaging. China investigating thing one outbreaks. Ewww...sand. coarse, rough, gets everywhere understand exactly saying. fears trepidation returning. sending kids back in-person learning district working create safe environment. believe done lot curb virus - fear students wont give damn. 

Again - speak district district only. feel done decent job reopening plans. firmly believe last weeks training teachers beneficial. firmly believe outbreak, go full remote right bat.

I'll bet would sad. empathy.

/s! look long term symptoms coronavirus? ruin life. Totally agree! also think, maybe naively, clear, consistent messaging beginning, would easier people. Since Americans critical thinking skills, need leadership tell us exactly do. “Social distancing” is/was mess. People somehow think families friends don’t count? Even now, see people indoors taking masks “when one around”, even medical professionals, newest research pretty clear airborne. Meaning trope “6 feet” indoors pretty pointless you’re sitting poorly ventilated space breathing talking away mask on. people know this! aren’t going take time actually read every update comes up. CDC, media, leadership horribly failed us many ways, simple act spreading clear concise messaging, me, egregious failure. India superpower Hey neat, that’s hospital... hospital us seen people lately sick covid dying. people everything opens fully strain rampant US since start. Nothing see here. Ok, maybe Florida lol. could convince there's way state could strip things them. can't believe ACLU someone challenged shit like yet honestly middle school teacher, confirm 100% case. current back school measures safety theatre parents scientific backing. Also, colleague total hysterectomy months chemo treatment, told return full time take unpaid leave (against doctor’s orders).

Zero remote positions offered district high risk staff, even though would cost district; which, we’re clear, ADA violation. are/our union trying hard push back this, school board power, literally refused meet us.

Cute. teachers know IRL already fence quitting. concerns: teaching rewarding, shitty parents/administrators/policies make almost impossible. know exact origin HIV. COVID 19 definitely China. 

Sex choice necessary survival. Breathing choice.

Again, try compare apples apples That's scheduled college prof. The. One week classes shut entire campus overrun positive cases. I'm fully online thankful pretty difficult teach way even college students theoretically choose (yet still skirt responsibilities). would want get caught cheating woman pic really unfair.. could state show states fight reduce infection rates.. enforce stricter quarantine measures, enforce strict mask mandates, etc. 

Instead allowing citizens become another statistic. 

""A single death tragedy, million statistic."" 

Take notes America, please vote. shift opinion Scotland since beginning lockdown. might dramatic sudden change think people agree old habits hardly justifiable more, voters also businesses local institutions realise options status quo. elements opportunity progress, political social sense. Remember one Spongebob episode Sandy said ""Stupidity virus, sure spreading like one""

Yea, quote kids show becoming PAINFULLY real day... many hospitalized You’ve said I’ve thinking! 

I think could made distance learning work. Teachers could spent summer coming ideas could work. Parents could spent summer making plans childcare. could worked. no. It’s like every single district country waited last minute it’s shit show. 

Im first year teacher don’t know fuck going on. school weird blended method. want school year hasn’t even officially started yet. Part wishes taken year stayed parents didn’t worry rent lol. awful. Agenda based share. Garbage. actually [tons ways fix need monitor stuff. Set kids can't share screens unless allowed. can't change names unless allowed. Use right settings prevent zoom bombing (in article). Agenda based share. Garbage. happy cake day Turn housing. Problem solved. kid bagging groceries job right now, would fully support quitting Probably started testing asymptomatic children often Tried 6 months ago work. Legalese wording state right kids granted equal access free public education, teachers record lessons, kid misses live stream, kid denied equal access. Even union agreed concept now. thing isn’t mutating.

Unfortunately, mutating. people infected, faster mutations come. important get virus control, fast possible. headline article makes sound worse here. Follow Clay Jenkins' twitter post links article stresses heading right leveling since governor Abbott stopped disrupting county judge Jenkins' ability take action. Dallas statistics found Dallas' DCHHS transparent communicating happening here, tone comes across taking death seriously, calling grim milestone par course him. deaths per capita terribly high, ""one death much"" kind high.

Just insight someone lives Dallas. people idiots people mostly cooperative staying home, wearing masks, etc working. I'm sorry but....
Isn't one OSHA's first rules, employee right work safe environment??? isn’t ‘parenthesis’ (I’d call brackets) isn’t either it’s quotes surprisingly they’re quoting someone windows open keep door shut case one comes starts shooting everyone up, elementary school....!? Holy fuck, country messed man!  Might unpopular opinion, advantages freedom speech China idiotic conspiracies anti-vax, COVID hoax flat earth censored China.

And perfect example disadvantage excessive freedom speech western countries. \*cough\* \*hack\* bottles \*wheeze\* wall. Exactly. Setting terms reference takes time. everyone always fucking rush time? add NH list too. motorcycle week ending weekend many headed Sturgis event ended. Probably dictated donors.

These unprecedented times, people remember WW2 last major upheaval life.

The worst people endured lifetime KFC chicken shortage.

And give inalienable right anything want public good?

It would better virus physical threat - like extreme weather temperatures ongoing - adapt them.

But back virus - people fund political parties hit hardest, therefore direction take needs lead us back way came irrespective 'few deaths' also previous advice.

This virus smart, smarter us going back already proven lose control certain point, countries world losing control went back fast.

But, look economic indicators, talking record breaking - even manage spin expenditure outside utilities food dropped zero 3 months.

Wow, record breaking rise expenditure nothing normal, that's incredible. wife medical records doctors office home. Girl office told everyone conspiracy. got said worst thing ever gone through. encourages masks. mean understand challenges parents, students, teachers face, parties can’t figure simple remote learning, internet connection, pc, email, webcam, etc fucked kids going going 2020’s beyond? really works nearly everyone it. 
 
Believe me, agree assertion, teacher, you’ll incredibly hard time convincing people put decades life make decent teachers salary retirement potentially lose ability work elsewhere. Look Florida’s leadership, would really give teacher good feeling laws changing? agree small breweries across country. in-laws European like going roadtrip visit many breweries possible. Good surprising finds time. rid IPA craps.

Big brand American beer though, yuck! They've Limbaugtomized. know cure institutionalize insane asylum rest us go lives. wonder many actually believe saying many joining mischief? going back Monday teach face face like you, sadly thankfull dont teach virtually. stress crazy workload I've seen place teachers hybrid digital insane. support, 50 kids, they're using microsoft teams LMS doesnt function correctly. cant use zoom either somehow still get evaluated. Fuck bullshit. probably known  it, would power state could maybe change archaic rules. Sad people see power numbers clear question. spread rate was, know. ""Google"" research R0 rate 0.6. NJ 0.78 Friday. NJ least 2.7 height. 

What read along way, perhaps underemphasized, extent voluntary distancing Swedes did. know rural nature country big cities, also factor. Plus factors clean air, universal health care comorbities cited. administration, government. NYC, even principal's union reopening pushing fully remote start school year.

Meanwhile, governor chancellor twisting facts press conferences. 

* say supplies necessary (the truth: school walkthrough last week we're missing basic things like plexiglass office. principals reporting similar situations schools). 
* said 74% families ready return school (the truth: survey families, 26% said opting fully remote. Many rest undecided unaware survey). 
* said every single building certified nurse (the truth: lot NYC schools nurses plan put place remedy that. Unless secret plan made public yet, happening).
* said 85% teachers ready go back school (the truth: 15% teachers approved work home. remainder us forced return school).

So yeah, principals school administration asking fully remote start schoom. custodians, nurses, school office workers, paraprofessionals, counselors asking thing.

The chancellor governor one's seem care health health children. Families First Coronavirus Response Act requires coronavirus testing [covered zero cost private insurance plan (both group individual). Additionally, forms government insurance plans cover it. top that, Department Health Human Services set lot [free community testing require insurance all. states free community testing sites too. biggest problem many different places covered many different ways, easy get tested free, also easy end paying test insured. terrible even would something that’s holding back.
Keeping losing insurance Every village idiot. they're harmless.

The internet allows idiots form communities. Together definitely harmless. DeSantis trying hide cases try force ppl high risk/can't eat live jobs here. benefits. gave co contracted failed unemployment site 135mil website another risk group, Medicare.

We fucked. saw video show market still closed

Get facts correct, simple mean you’re asking teachers risk potentially dying loved ones dying Covid, potentially lose pay, savings, ability work somewhere else, retirement they’ve paying decade+ told keep door shut active shooter reasons

This stupid hell. odds happening? One 10 million? accessible people without medical training? FWIW ""Italy"" context means ""Lombardy"", region northwestern part country. rest peninsula experienced pandemic similar rest Europe fair RICH. forget important caveat. youths need instructors live perpetual fear.  Recently where? Following science? Covid science fucking place, still isn’t even close consensus masks work not. haven’t ever started surveillance testing fucking idea death rate infection rate actually is, don’t know methods transmission are, don’t know people get sick don’t. Science put 100% eggs vaccine basket expecting everyone wait undetermined amount time vaccine lives social needs fall apart. U.S fault Best Works me. ashes thrown sea. Rather spread wind around Rockie Mountains. love mountains.  masks stay-home somethibg else think? general, say happened 4 people millions covid...I consider outlier knows accurate.

Now starts happening hundreds thousands...its different story.  Thank reply. NDTV already considered joke country. little credibility left, any. warned Wet Markets China government nothing still open. Chinas fault. 

Somethings better left jungles. eat everything moves. Simple that. windows structure egress windows.... know anything layout school. Never heard politician lie before. know better elect liars office. call conspiracy, statistics, truth big deal. Damn tarnashin', one flyin' machines? Death rarely one sole reason unless die due acute trauma.

You really die due type 2 diabetes, die cardiovascular diseases, yet accredited highest risk factors premature death. Why? rarely die single disease complications likely cause, T2D CVD leading heart attacks. Likewise, die directly Covid-19 virus, die directly flu many viral infections, mean harmful significantly increase risk complications.  teacher zoom lessons. day long. Kids teachers stare computer 6-7 hours day! 

Kids giving teachers getting frazzled. consistent head ache eyes hurt. year? Shit! Think talking preserving skull thing costing much. would see people staying home?  Brainwashed animals can't see facts, really feel sorry you. Continue listening mainstream media experts feed information. 

You people longer ability think yourself, need others you.

Bye Everyone crying foul China certainly forget lick Saudi Arabia’s blood stained boots Medicare already working site? No. look back talk memory

I keep looking forward time. going weird stain lives everyone entire world that's mind-blowing.

Stay strong pal. I'm sure saying helps feel bad many people right now. Kids hopefully resilient thinking stunting daily routines/lives/development breaks heart. always stigmatized us though. BLM protesters wore protective masks, tried stay 6 feet away others. expect protests still caused kind bump virus numbers.

The ""CONvid-19"" protesters shoulder shoulder protective masks. They'll spread virus like crazy. 

Good thing ""Hoax Virus""! best part “said many physicians doctors”. Technically China also WW twice, China U.S. side WWs. 17th highest world IIRC wealth controlled MUCH smaller caste Saudi Arabia well dad took antibody test yesterday, pink eye, diarrhea, sore throat really bad ear pain around month half ago, see faint like igG section test I’m sure consider positive, I’ve read even it’s faint it’s positive could weak positive due antibodies decreasing I’m sure. took test mine clear except control line.

Especially pandemic medical news. know, people go blind every year looking eclipse naked eye. people understand giant ball fusion space dangerous, I'm pretty sure plenty go blind looking this, 3-5 years get massive spike skin cancer deaths. ""stacks bodies."" virus isnt fucking deadly. Nothing article stated wrong.  
Trump thought Bleach could help. obviously case. communicated regardless. People drank Bleach that. national healthcare

If noticed, call ""socialized"" healthcare here. Ok you. Here's frustration remote learning. remote itself, epic failure administration. They've constantly dragged feet since March. 

How Earth could least made plan B distance long time? district Superintendent even admitted ""I thought going end May."" Meanwhile... are. I've teaching online two weeks. Personally fine me. I'm comfortable it. there's direction district build admin. staff meeting next week brainstorm teach online?! FUCKING MARCH!

The district promised parents we'd comprehensive training. paper, PD week it. reality, didn't. training. ol' bullshit PD every year. blew whistle. least tried. set anonymous e-mail e-mailed Principal's boss couple others including Superintendent. got response. got online training. 

In macro realm things. COVID taught anything country leadership. Leaders get paid supposedly best equipped handle things. aren't. clue even willing risk bending status quo. seem think shuffle papers around over. schools districts, politicians (both parties, Trump Biden effectively address looming health economic crisis). idea social organization farce. Something had, name tradition only. We're own. 

TLDR: failures remote learning failure admin, reflection failures leaders society whole. hope Evers takes action police regarding Whittenhouse murders. There's police department maybe needs rebuilt ground up. It’s like every single district country waited last minute it’s shit show

That's exactly happened. couple weeks ago, wife still know district going approach remote/in class learning. Surprised Yeah exactly, interesting wonder also question deaths big things country? Cause I’m pretty confident lot things play role stuff besides covid. 6-foot rule works great Europe  job. sucked. i’m pretty sure pandemic ended people stopped wearing masks. 
Wasn’t social end pandemic? society decided didn’t give fuck anymore? covid specifically, using social media manipulate gullible citizens mobilize behind false cause. china? Australia? south africa? mention everything? mean, every single human rights abuse. know why? can't. Overwhelming topic much information unproductive little information. president unconstitutional shit everyday. seem issue. That's feature, glitch. problem chart people stupid selfish work well.

People simple pretend thought correct, claim follow rules, people current rules.

The easiest way say masks public. Period. confusion accidents leading unnecessary death suffering. Dude teachers US never supported. I'm 90s kid. went middle school 5½"" floppy disk Macs even though home computer Windows CD drive. underfunded hell, &amp; grew thinking normal. Imagine shock learned kids went school teachers least finished college  went around attacking atheists every chance got, would pathetic existence. Atheism cool btw, believe power you! See bitter angry. worse isolated, raped, starved, tortured possibly trafficked? Death. much else compares. CT here. Gov done good job. Still, son starting 8th grade tomorrow spent week making sure affairs order I'm auto-immune compromised late 50s. needs interaction kids we're sending him. 2 days week person, still there's lot Karens children Karens. happens great majority population refuse get vaccinated? People sort rational thought wearing masks long time, Coronavirus isn’t going leave USA anytime soon. Must difficult Trump fan days Bake 2 hours 175, UVC light 2 min, let sit 7 days. welcome never went college. someone works research- let translate. article states one site (palm beach county) move forward project would 10 volunteers.

Im certified contract tracer, know better spreads. Absolutely better you.

""start this, stop that, stop one early"" variety. would actually inappropriate them; they're regulator results submitted to. Okay then, correct verse 4:91 (also I'd like source mind, sincerely doubt translation), verses?

Are seriously gonna tell God promoting justice said ""unleash wrath"" atheists merely existing?

Yeah right, thing proving Qur'an extremely inconsistent messaging. First I’d like commend wife. couldn’t imagine working small children this. Secondly, think major complaint cleaning classrooms comes secondary Ed. Imagine every 45 minutes two minutes passing period prep lesson. Wash 16 desks disinfectant. Somehow disinfect chairs well lay completely new untouched set classroom manipulative every kid. 8 times attempting teach lesson make curriculum group based students can’t sit groups. Teachers quitting aren’t asked teach ( know job). also asked counselors, janitors, nurses. spend money, got slashed year, cleaning supplies extra masks students. It’s beyond stressful, add fact districts giving us two days less notice changing school run. often times forcing teachers teach online person learning time extra prep time, happen hours. personally school almost 10 hours day trying plan virtual hybrid schedules district keeps threatening bring us back drop hat. hope cleared misunderstandings. article wasn’t clear details. Maybe possible Zoom practical Online Learning system. designed students teachers share voice, text, video images. shut would kneecapping whole learning software system. E-Learning one way Youtube video. something mean remote threat. Wrong. Keep strong pal. story hurt because, even though I'm parent, understand somewhat going through. ten days without power thing one scary things feel like we're starting see point. I've noticed stores things like shirts socks think bigger companies pivoted masks. 

These kinds things scary feel like they're signs things come. figure people get infected less people we'll upkeep things like that. I'm already seeing things like roadwork get delayed things like mail taking longer deliver. (Likely reasons considering Trump seems hate USPS)

I hope I'm wrong hope things manage upkept I'm looking forward winter... #1 worry rush one great, people lose confidence future vaccines, shit hits fan even worse. Kansas Board Regents comprised nine members, appointed Governor Kansas. 

That **FIRST** complete sentence link. 

Where disconnect bad realize money? money Kansas.. rich people watching accounts dwindle. Please think I'm defending dude clearly read article, headline imply whereas actual article didn't.

The headline *is* sorta clickbaity. means kid must virus school....

Meaning everyone exposed child exposed virus. Wait don’t migrant detention centers substandard sanitation sick die? It’s better would assume however... judge? (I’m American obviously) ex-Muslim still bitter. stuck, haven’t moved aren’t free. coming someone part “ex-Hindu” community, pathetic existence. observations peoples post like yourself. worry EVERYONE manipulated putin. He's like evil mastermind global puppeteer. TT beautiful country bright, beautiful people. share class issues 20 years ago, I’d move heartbeat could. 

I missing doubles. 

(Not trini. visited young adult.) mexican children hostages usa? Covid spreading prisons  It’s fascinating there’s almost puritanical obsession “fun” activities potentially spreading coronavirus (beaches, parks, etc) yet barely anyone talking nursing homes...in state least that’s hospitalizations deaths originated. benefits come state level union, school. join, health insurance, etc. understand exponential spread? Look graph cases location anywhere world. Yes, we've many ""crazy breakouts""! hold weddings &amp; birthday parties, surprised many get sick die. Colleges reopened thousands sick students.

Where getting news? hope FOX. protests really get thinking people coordinate get funding lol? Yeah, getting kind scary me, future teacher. I’m supposed track student teaching next semester, hell gonna happen? gonna get degree time? quite sure Zoom video learning going assume nightmare. got 30 kids trying scream yell interrupting teacher trying teach think compares literal chattel slavery conditions middle east, definitely perspective. It’s Alabama, let’s face it, driving home. seems take willingness cheat thousands fellow man. Seems like government jobs require either masochist sociopath days. Thank perspective. Peace you. It’s almost parents supposed ones raising children.... Wait, no, get ass back work 40+ hours week pay someone else it, make boss filthy rich get second job make ends meat. Suck up, buttercup  Jesus Christ 2020 people STILL saying Russia lmfao. sure FDA isn’t involved trial oversight? can't tell worst best sense humor I've ever seen. Russia theory come from? acknowledged COVID exists? IIRC Putin's bragging new vaccine. Yes, that's point. Bring attention. Every human rights abuse. There's room. we're ever going become civil society, protect vulnerable across every border. don’t control media enough hide stacks bodies. Got wonder long vaccine “testing” religions supposed monolithic commandments rules, humans deal understanding culture. literally thousands interpretations Islam religions.

So even infer Muslims ridiculous motion, whole purpose logic dehumanize them. know comes dehumanization.

We wasting time anyway, year 3000, abrahamic religions around probably higher population. wrong ad hominem attack? parents terrible right? wrong, answer questions.

Or closest going get admitting spouting topic clueless on?

You really need pay attention claims accusing people making, entirely clueless. Somebody retweeting “the gateway pundit” reliable source. even comorbidities ultimately fatal life limiting. Parent grandparents live kids too. extremely large crowds totally justified though. kid went school week.. seams ok knows? sucks kids get school Sorry you’re absolutely wrong. lack understanding virus spreads lack understanding political education become. think anyone believes covid hoax (hopefully). calling deceitful reaction it. well possible lockdowns kill many people virus would have. think important bring public debate ensure weighing pros/cons policy, since black white decision lockdown = automatically save lives. SA really care human rights. districts can’t provide teachers need. systemic issue teachers. still haven’t recovered 2008 economic downturn financially. took pay freezes waited past year education recover. always last. Dead f-ing last funding economy crashes. People always complaining teachers bragging extra $500 recovered taxes. isn’t fear COVID. don’t resources teach safely. Buildings old (think infrastructure), technology old gets outdated rapidly. Many teachers don’t simple projection tech mention even web cams digital platforms handle “business like” remote “meetings.” shit hole mess years. COVID finally got people’s attention bad saying years. Yet. won’t matter. COVID vaccinated away. “economy” get first boost American school system find slipping behind top 1% send children top schools around world. Welcome land free. Free use financial human resources make grossly rich paying taxes back system. Times sure changed educating base seen counterproductive ability create low wage workers. 1,500 refugee children gone, poof, disappeared 2017 2018. also trial 10 people, weird, many classes many tests either. problems solved. everywhere, parts still think hoax! majority people places think over. administrators deserve fired district start coming distance learning plan June.

The remaining teachers restructure larger districts administrators actually jobs.

In mean time, sympathy teachers put effort make lesson plans fall worked distanced learning, demanding unions least start demanding action unions get administrators job worked distanced plans.

Regardless whether help district not, would responsible lesson plans. making/converting/researching soon obvious possibility. 

These extraordinary times living in. People need step hard thing want get society possible. condemn equal disgust? Human rights humans. Stop whataboutism, really nothing address actual problem. contained it.... reminds me, family go get flu shots year. made hvac changes school site. Swamp chicken. numbers come CDC. Facebook post included tween interpretation comes random woman. go tweeters profile find tweet interpretation fact coming gateway pundit. QlHonestly kids want well ones care far lives. Parents need parent teachers teach. ur kid acting parents fault. realize contact tracing apps save location history, you? sarcasm, guy top levels government claims exercising depletes battery. Spanish flu magnitudes deadly COVID-19. even realm. putting mildly say we've complete overreaction virus. nothing religion tho. 


Its Saudi Arabia backed USA. 


Because oil=$$$$$$ issue specifically wanting use data use phone. logic wife makes $65k 10 months work. means actual full time pay equivalent $65k * 12/10 months $78k. Plus full benefits year around. 

Also defined benefit plan retire put 30 years service. It’s 60% paid annually based average last 3 years employment. That’s paid indefinitely retired teacher dies, full survivorship benefits windowed spouses limited 10 years retirement.

How hell peanuts??? 

Again fucking planet living on, broseph?

What trying achieve behalf teachers peanuts comments? 

Higher pay? 

The pension liabilities states already control public positions like these. statements totally ignorant baseless.  Sad people accepted even support idea. Time fight back. uh huh USA room talk comes immigrant detention centers. issues system need fix. literally repeated guy said... 

I'm confused calling dumbass.

Hes right, nobody impression current guidelines effort stop spread. That's possible. current guidelines, wearing mask social distancing effect slow down, frees health care system severe cases treated best can. 

That's exactly said, exactly guy said. Read article, paranoid freak. answers it. I’m thinking another country think that's point though. WNY can't keep 2% best case scenario nice weather kids school chance everyone forced inside cold weather. Saudis respecting basic human rights? Gee what's new phone horizontal mode stand would do. teach laptop phone stand, done since February classes China. exceptional equipment. What? I'm talking regulatory standards? Thats idolizing anything. EU stricter regulatory standards almost everything US. Never. EU sure shit isn’t going it, yeah people fucked forever. reason. make plans Wuhan. want see place investigating, scouting spots, etc?

China wants everyone forget virus came Wuhan, world forget instead hiding it, held initial planning there. side looks getting, Wuhan priority started way Trump. article doesn’t say anything “stacks bodies”, talks vaccine trials. Nothing goes back normal virus rages, masks prevent enjoying life. Everyone loves free market don't. never ""up date"", really. pretty ridiculous get go (and guidelines, adopted Italy instance, even say 1 meter, i.e. around 3 feet!). whatever, least obvious evidence meaningless... particular article though, least me, since get past cookie screen eludes me. long ago europeans seizing impounding medical equipment destined european nations like animals, bizarre idolisation foreign going help anyone real terms. Trump literally defends butchered US citizen embassy. Even audio tapes released. Saudi Arabia's prince higher priority United States ever was. Imagine America would like competent leader listened advice technocrats. Four dead Ebola reason resign. Kill 250,000 troll army rise defend disinformation. don’t know naive are.

I'm barely pointing naivety honestly think people say, problem several years go ahead?

My point American people outraged demanded changed years ago, *didn't*.

If accepted ""national security"" purpose years ago, sure fighting COVID (and shouldn't, really) considered national security importance.

The issue tracking (it's done US government), enforcing quarantine infected people. couple friends posted this. think people understand Covid kill person, like flu kill person. complications arise kill person, especially underlying health issues. 

My one friend also posting anti mask bs basically making fun choose wear one. get it, area extremely low basically non existent case count, still wear mask odd time venture that's comfort level. person longer friend. We’ve gathered now. shit realization Whenever read hear “human rights abuse” media, know it’s propaganda. Commercial landlords want money Pret closes, give use buy stuff Tory friends? yeah really don’t get argument, Saudis treat everyone like shit regardless religion ethnicity. *Childhood obesity isn’t highly contagious it?*
You're right. Children grow fat eating shitty food parents fed also go produce children poor eating habits

*Even child decide eat hot dogs areas secondhand smoke.*
Kids choose homes. Think stupid sound here.

*2% population town 60 neighbors.*
COVID kill 2% population. 2% infected. add current aggregate positive case counts USA 2% population. 2% 2% town 3,000 1 person. Math hard

*These sick dying people fellow Americans trying conflate consuming hot dogs cigs deadly, highly contagious virus rather acknowledge fact people attended Sturgis contracted spread COVID. fuck wrong you?*

Well, Secondhand smoke kills 40,000 Americans every year estimated 13M children US obese. populations actually choice avoid behaviors put serious risk health complications. get it. Covid bad. ebola country dozen major public health crises tackle sky-rocketingly higher mortality rates COVID.

So fact, problem lack fundamental understanding numbers work rather rationally look situation realize country ~350,000,000 people going die time time occasionally, they'll die something peaceful passing sleep 99 years old. I've heard type before. ""lets lock entire country go anywhere saves 1 life, worth it"" feel way cigarettes? booze? cars? boats? Airplanes? People get food poisoning processing mistakes carelessness forced eat Soylent? mean, fuck, even allowed leave house? know even COVID, sniffles, could get older person sick kill them? painfully obvious need protect point doomers like actually stopping progress think tens millions kids going die return schools despite &lt;20 kids age 18 dying COVID date still, there's dozen mortality factors kill children higher rates. thought way build immunity pile 100 llbs eating nachos watching tv, wish would make minds. Last one, tried us vpn, still popped up. time. running low shark fin rhino testicles cure ED Unfortunately FDA undermined credibility longer trust anything say. Retiring ones going tech savvy Hello.

Let's try ignorant, please. Seriously... designed stop people living GDPR countries accessing site all, nominally allowing it? intelligence test see figure get past screen? Quite true everything mass shooting 911. Sounds good teacher like bad marriage. get support need, stay children. need, use phone's camera upload pc. Time cancel Middle East. Overdue 35 years issue EUA vaccine lots people think political even isn't. may well depress number taking vaccine -- believe polls indicated 40% wouldn't. EUAs previously issued help FDA's credibility better lots phase 3 trial data released showing efficacy safety groups targeted first use. Uh oh. Like what? What? scientists working day night develop safe vaccine absolutely heroes well. Trudeau right. Europe seeing surge due excessive holiday goers. see, thank answer faculty states obedient? uni CA professors would well start every class update spite university. Picture taken telephoto lens compresses distance makes things seem crowded are?

Check. bright side... natural selection work Here's latest Taiwan Stop harassing going troll. losers poor people work mostly jobs Impossible work home. 

But hey, lets rage stonk market cause taking poor. district switch programs. cheap. 

This focus think you/they need target then, given limitations presenting. 

Either crowdsourced financial backing open source software even student project software. even need many tools software use need work need work, right?

But thing seeing repeated tools work. need tools work. Either make tools get elsewhere options see.


There's tons codemonkeys nowadays wandering around.. :P rethought position dawned people likely wearing masks people would trust vaccine, therefore making masks kind redundant. guess covid run amok anti vaccine anti mask crowd. cares teachers elect them? Teacher police unions democratically elected citizens yet exercise absurd amounts power government policy. 

Teachers also generally mandated resident district teach, that's besides point. get special powers influence merely periodically threaten hold entire education system hostage. Imagine comparing less 200,000 COVID deaths systematic murder 12M non-combatants. 

And America still less deaths per capita Italy, UK, Sweden, Spain. leaders equally guilty murder inability stop virus? officers paid overtime get significant raises making different ranks / promotions.

Teachers really get kind option. Yeah, folks still wits need careful sound like agreeing crazies.

Like crazies already downvoting us. LOL, yes. Neonazi agenda pushing PCR testing issues agenda science analysis. would thunk1 moron. 2-3 years hell long time. gonna play shitshow long. Got life enjoy.

Although, lets realistic, even CZ matter time make andatory again. Maybe people protest much, not. Maybe. once, masks supposed mandatory two days again. People got pissed much gov backpedaled... still hope. US government something similar people southern boarder. slightly better. person got tested campus here: people getting tested getting positives asymptomatic mild symptoms. said, still ton people likely virus asymptomatic testing. school provides testing anyone wants it, mandate it, even sick close contact infected people.  important distinguish asymptomatic presymptomatic, one thing. believe presymptomatic people incredibly contagious. Asymptomatic people definitely contagious too, however. Hardly. could far better, could definitely without government's mixed messages (Go campaigns encourage domestic travel eating out, example).

Not mention tone-deaf response sending two cloth masks per household turned mostly useless unless got small face (actual filtering ability aside, barely covers face.

On plus side, least more-aware public part, even though still non-mask-wearing people (thankfully nowhere serious issue compared West). Holy shit, fucking dumb? That’s means. point masks limit spread. Flattening curve people still get using common sense, masks actions means get sick go ICU you’re dying spot ICU go. Otherwise, stuck home without access ventilator keep dumbass alive. Seriously, pull head ass. kids developed significant mental health problems quarantine. hoping recover guessing take years. Politicized?

Like politicizing early crew setting things actual investigation come? Right bro/sis. Stay strong. Bad economy certain areas sectors, bad economy general. Isnt whole point we’re making. Winners Losers. I’m glad I’m dual citizen, but: family ties that’ll hold states, even then. I’d lucky cross border anyways given state things. 

And nailed it. pandemic shows deep rooted selfishness, narcissism, tribalism here. forget anti-intellectualism, faux science lean. It’s bonkers. 20?! type news bad! basically justifies attendance huge events. 20 gets thousands attendees people start attending events again. They're somewhere middle, made fair share mistakes. mean Palestine, Qatar, Yemen... Saudis richest politically intimidating doesn’t mean need forget shit going around them. certainly reason.

This pre-investigation party making initial plans, actual investigation. quran hadith II info.

First dont act read quran, read meaning know Allah despises torture anything cruel anybody. stop acting like know things people like know fuckall speak shit like know everything. Fried also delicious! Seems pretty obvious risks are.

Lies, damned lies, statistics. Realistically mid late next year hard painful, change requires difficult painful times. believe world better one day struggles now. Oh. seems like missed opportunity gauge effectiveness measure. #FDA LOL!

Was okay Don? one's ignoring protests. seem spread covid much. helps police conveniently kept tear gassing people encourage keep masks on. 

But keep pretending social shenanigans morally equivalent protesting police abuse. Totally different beast. government response Canada much better happening United States. think one super powers humanity generalized ignorance. perceived risky difficult things were, might ever gotten done. Ocean exploration good one think like wow that's crazy.

The idea preserving ones life also relatively new concept brought improved medical care. may surprising preservation life isnt top priority honestly people making correct assessment odds dying relatively low themselves, that's another humanity superpower, tribalism caring tribe, whatever define as. care what's outside tribe. 

One important things leader right try help people learn tribe humanity. anyway. Maybe billionaires part tribe. Lol people real world gotten things least extent. don’t know single person still stays home 100% time. “Quarantine” finished mostly dog pony show begin with.

The entire fucking country closed this? Easy answer: No. dude cherry picking hates connected dots. argument flu, high percentage people die flu underlying conditions, yet 37,100 die flu (US average last 10 years) compared 180,000 six months COVID-19 actually idea talking about. completely nonsensical framing situation evidence ever happening. course 10 million Americans got hospital's would overwhelmed death rate would go up. never happen never happened provided evidence happening lol. 

Now 10 million Americans eventually get diagnosed period months see definetely realistic death rate stay likely go better treatments developed. death rate disease vastly lower back people dying New York months ago even though people infected. Japan one highest life expectancies world. think elderly bit healthy elderly. treat exercise norm say ""failure exercise may reduce vaccine response""?

Yea one time think that. majority people trying get day day you’re asking lot people people wanna get back normal actively working towards  what? not, CDC graph shows one least comorbidity numbers underlying conditions.

Basically: residential trash pick people home. Plus, higher rates absenteeism. Imagine absolutely terrified maybe looking bit foolish wearing mask build elaborate conspiracy theory head justify wearing one. Ironically people vocal calling others 'sheeple' ones suckered hardest crackpots. That’s he’s talking here, don’t think fully understand he’s referring to. common occurrence clinical trials fundamentally ethical consideration.

A clinical trial ethical state clinical equipoise — basically, don’t know whether placebo treatment (in case, vaccine) going better outcomes. However, don’t want unnecessarily expose either group increased risk, trials Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) monitors data regular intervals comes evaluate whether trial continue.

Think way: initial data showed vaccine killing people, would want keep trial going administer vaccine, would want stop trial immediately communicate FDA rejection? Obviously, you’d latter — would unethical keep administering one arm trial data showing better.

It’s similar concept here; data shows vaccine protective clinically significant statistically significant level without significant incidence significant side effects, unethical continue administering placebos data showing vaccine better placebo. point, trial ended prematurely, data reported FDA application authorization.

I’ll honest, Hahn made comments, first reaction startled *wasn’t* always clearly plan. He’s probably explaining first time while, entire country interested results clinical trial, people learning actually works. remember, NY hit it’s peak zero testing available, CDC botched testing. NY wasn’t even allowed test FDA March 13th. Imagine federal government incompetent couldn’t deliver testing, literally blocked states Yes, is.

The virus already observed (that’s science does, observed reports observed) burned multiple large population centers United States, new areas becoming hotspots every day.

THATS I'm actually even sure saying. I'm expert PDF linked staph aureus vaccine, phase 3, found effective placebo associated higher rate multiorgan failure. phase 3 trial actually terminated due adverse lack efficacy due adverse events. HSV vaccine produced solid antibody response phase 2 phase 3 found provided transient partial protection thus approved. think Africa would good place manufacturing [archive link anyone trouble accessing article Nothing said backed science lot people using London NYC proof 20% herd immunity theory. say soon tell. Though probably highly unlikely get surge like already have. Yeah technically still antivaxxer, dumb antivaxxer 👻 calm people. It’s Sunday night 🥂 yeah should’ve separated influenza that. remember, covid came US peak flu season, i’d say 95% “influenza &amp; pneumonia” comorbidities actually pneumonia, caused covid.

some experts actually projected maintain social distancing mask wearing could relatively low flu common cold season year since it’s less contagious covid. 

gotta weigh 40% chance flu vaccine works year vs possibility contracting covid going get vaccine.

[here’s case study 3 patients covid flu, 2 fine 1 died cardiac arrest. 

[here’s another source talks possibility could either make illnesses worse, could actually peak different time. There's multiple polio vaccines. live virus, dead virus.

I'm merely saying pays careful rush things out. get bad batch, bad things happen, today's media world people going freak out. needed continue polio vaccine back even mistake, helping harming. today, mistake like would get lot attention rabble rousing could seriously hamper efforts get vaccine.

Thus, need rush things. Get trash fucking ignorant! don’t even know 12,000,000 starving year estimates 130,000,000 starving death? mentioned several times, it’s easy find. Get work, cowards. “You understand death rate nothing amount people right? Like 10 million Americans get vs 1 million Americans get that's going mean change death rate. percentage whole number.” Damn it’s almost like said 2 minutes ago actually slowed down. peak number deaths july 5th 690 cases. 1k numbers media showed numbers lag. COVID-19 nearly ten times deadlier infectious disease US, influenza kills 37,100 people per year (average last ten years) 180,000 last six months COVID-19.

The US 570 deaths per million COVID-19, average rest world 90 per million. Reddit also believes acknowledging herd immunity may reached limited areas advocating removing restrictions letting virus go wild everywhere. you, actually anyone reading needs someone talk feel free message me. time , listen every word. Many times that's people need heard let go things building holding in.

You appreciated needed wish best. Yes hospitalizations going down, someone supposed take credit it? Florida 100 weekday deaths day another two months.

NY real social distancing guidelines schools .5 percent positivity rate. seemed challenged science math, that’s OK. need help getting GED, Khan Academy Tump University might able help. Incredible.... sheer lack morality Whelp. End days got frankly later thought, figured it'd nukes would end humanity. get it, virus bad. can't close econom longer. I’m still afraid outcome. Remember polls Hillary to. still think Ohio could hacked straight tv show scandal.  I've heard staff worked multiple facilities primary driver this, problem US. AFFECTED Seems like bait everyone America ignored virus 330 million Americans would get 10 milllion people would die would get lung permanent lung damage. neglecting spread. Iowa governor special kind stupid. think agenda get rid cash? worry you? Imagine business owner states opening colleges right now. Many areas starting get covid modicum control throughout August. Case numbers falling highly problematic states. following trends, see numbers looking good, various ""benchmarks"" steadily improving. Maybe order shipment whatever sell, preparing able operate business relatively normally. BAM University Fuck opens 20 miles away, shits 3000 cases 2 weeks, shut back down. 

I would absolutely fucking livid. sad thing people US still don’t think big deal. cousin presumably went buy groceries. said well test hasn’t come back yet wore mask. Fuck going out. youngs bearing brunt really think need read Good luck. Stay safe. pay help, I'd guess real issue lack hours. People really crappy jobs $9/hr give enough hours make worth it. people want work 3 hours day, 5 days week, split shift, get dawn go back interrupt afternoon order make $100 per week taxes. Jobs like probably usually filled stay home parents kids school retired people, probably weighing risk versus benefit right differently would previously. Chinese numbers wrong, much. We've seen since start pandemic cases inline imported cases China measured neighbors. Funnily people come families left country looking better life. Unfortunately clearly disagree governments handling corona virus decide break rules trash innocent persons fence has..... unfortunately warned would ""normal"" programme said health recovery Covid-19 pandemic would ""cornerstones"". 

So... can?  isn’t option private school teachers yet, is... IFR close zero people ages 15 44, increasing 3.1% 65–74-year-olds 11.6% anyone older.

How fear mongering? literally says it’s almost dangerous people 50 grandchildren! Wait remote kids attending daily virtually count district? state, know do. I'm north I've heard south, guess shocked state somehow decided remote teaching require teachers. Spoiled fucking wankers, rest Aus would gladly cut Victoria rest us push sea. Nextdoor. Would gladly flee Hungary get overrun ""families children"" consisting 99.9% 20-25 year old terrorists male sex arab origin.

Now border closing shit curse blessing time, laws apply normal people blocked crossing border, laws apply leftie financed terrorist insurgents, walk across without problems else ""u wacist"". This, please. Crazy think 9/11 happens every 3 days yet everyone seems desensitized worse pushing reopen faster. guess facts numbers reported accurately. mom retired spring school begging come back. taught 39 years left things kept getting worse fucking drained. She’s considering seeing worn became hope doesn’t. diabetics dialysis fearing lifes every day, partying under-25s drive numbers worldwide?
What older bus drivers?
Medical workers?
People lost decade-old business due high chance infection customers?
Teachers?

And group fear getting Covid-19, sheer body ability bounce back economically time, suddenly hit?

By time reach age early 30 start paying serious tax money, least half debt already paid back, taxes inflation capital older people accumulated. would suggest responding, ""Dad, want put child grandchildrens health risk make $60 per day?"" Sadly that's probably happen.

No. Worked torture facility??? explains it. according this: graphs here: Haha many early back March April. don’t remember details... customers completely ignoring pandemic. Yeah get summers off. teacher, one answers district can't give going back. going sub long stretches even enough subs day two? COVID-19 clinical presentation SARS-COV-2. da thunk? Well, bills start comin' stop comin' Taiwan ranks near top tests per confirmed say they’ve done incredible job containing understatement Republican Lt.

Conservatives fought tooth nail force Terri Schiavo live irreversible vegetative state, can’t bothered bare minimum try stop people dying COVID. proof Republicans Pro-life. Bullshit. People say likely never lived Asia. monolithic thing exaggerated. I'm gonna say one last time: process something historic. one major vaccine rushed unsuccessful mean one be, too. want take it, don't. please engage people unvaccinated reach herd immunity. I’ve seen people mentioning tests anywhere free $300.  Depends lot factors.  sarcasm? Going get pulled ""No edited titles"". It’s possible. least districts least drafted
Contingency plans manner tho I’m even seeing lot pull away Fox.  one state. Go “select jurisdiction” dropdown. Check states re-opened early: FL SC GA TX, get started. Hell, select state decent population center. 

PS, actually know nazis did? Hint: tiny bit worse wear paper mask miss sporting events. I'm pretty sure family got watched Sonic theater end February. movie worth it. gonna awhile go back. mean, morons accusing families Sandy Hook victims hoaxes. loved ones *massacred children*, would accuse parents perpetrating hoaxes *right faces*. Nothing sacred massive idiot.

And yes, know Sandy Hook thing US, UK, morons everywhere cut cloth. know shocks still adults comprehend this. Sigh. one teachers. AMA.  highly doubt making potentially dangerous vaccine mandatory go well people. I'm getting states. seen hope change. many useful idiots. stopped testing releasing accurate data.

But people try tell magically got control literally opposite anything rest planet done. Well, meddling away. Canada, keep pushing anti-Trudeau stuff. pretty easy see many bot accounts. Also, love bad Trudeau hashtags seem really trend whilst sleeping. Almost like come places un time zones. Yeah. Asia people mostly kept mouths shut, wore masks, washed sanitised hands, kept social distancing guidelines. say mostly. we’ve minimal cases compared “don’t take freedom” countries. Huh.... imagine that. 
I’m Japan wear mask anytime outside. take shoes door shower/wash clothes soon come home. sanitise hands enter exit shops banks etc. It’s preference live like it’s working. local people talk same. feel like life kind boring less effort freaking social media, shops street etc. people kept shit together lot countries would ok now. (I’m looking America). actually trust numbers...on day Florida's Department Health saying number COVID cases schools confidential matter? Sorry, means universities teach subject got 2.8 in? Look fool.

Spanish flu killed 3% entire world population

I going say *orders magnitude* want anyone accuse hyperbole :)
 economic devastation lasted generation 
 
Correct. claim otherwise. effects Spanish Flu felt society decades, effects COVID-19. Despite this, catastrophe faded rapidly memory. called *the forgotten pandemic* nothing. Consider following year, 1920, sporting events took place: 
 
Jan - Australian Tennis Open 
Apr - Sep - Olympic Games 
June - Golf US Open 
July - Cycling Tour de France 
July - Tennis Wimbledon 
July - Golf British Open 
Aug - Golf US PGA 
Sep - Tennis US National Championship 
Oct - Baseball World Series 
 
When major international sporting events held year following worldwide pandemic that's pretty much definition ""back normal"" Dingdingding! though, IMO algorithms, Youtube, Twitter, Fox (""news"") contribute this. distrust media, trust Fox? They're media too! Nope.

it saying 10,000 people EITHER **unwritten cause**. nurse, doctor, whomever, chose wrote additional cause death. 

Remember, Hospitals incentive write covid, free 40k government.  Schools district least meet specific air quality standards - get rid classroom plants, classroom pets, air conditioning kept even one's using building, etc. (Learned PTO work / school board budget meetings.) part that, staff informed very, clearly must never open windows windows open replaced non-opening ones remodels.  Feels like someone got hoisted petard one. moment realize Facebook Karens might point vaccine recodes RNA. Would makr difference given quality American education. Id rather kids teachers ali e dead Teachers get fired time. ""tenure"" simply means due process let go. teacher without tenure let go time, reason without due process. Tenure mean cannot get fired.

Also, teachers get paid contract day work. Unlike jobs, get paid holidays get paid summer (Many teachers ask 9.5 month salary divided paid 12 months budgeting purposes). teachers work hundreds hours beyond contract day one getting rich teaching. Many teachers work jobs summer supplement income. dad painting business coached three sports part because, despite master's degree, salary less many jobs requiring less education.

It's challenging yet rewarding job regularly get bashed ignorant people could never job themselves.

My parents beloved public school teachers/coaches made positive differences hundreds lives. I'm proud followed footsteps I'd like thank teachers teachers working really hard make best current situation kids. I'm aware API unfortunately, said probably exist thanks China's affinity big data. dig yourself. can’t plan resources. Teachers *laid off* summer months, districts don’t extra money invest planning. Oh, still planned, free. waiting guidance federal government, state government, county health department, know budget school year around October. extra money allocated *planning* extra funds spring used buying new technology spring. finished first week distance learning quick Google form checkout end week 9th graders. One questions rate week 1 (terrible) 5 (awesome). expecting mostly 1s 2s would say 90% kids rated week 4 5, said really enjoyed classes. older kids ok, understand make best bad situation. wife teacher president local union chapter. illegal teachers strike state. union basically power all. collective bargaining rights. Every single person representing mayor President* Republicans keep attacking unions keep making things worse. carve valuable, existing real estate.

There fabulous 99 percent invisible (podcast) episode shows movies NYC character goes ""dark alley"" filmed alley New York. Yes, has. teachers could literally die stuff. **blame them** finally fed enough demand treated fairly? CO VIDE Respiratory illnesses love company. Kind pathogens kill whole people.

It's like deaths Maria: handful deaths recorded hurricane, thousands inexplicably dead drowning, trauma, infections, getting meds time. 9/11 Katrina! But, know, maybe would died anyway /s. kind bullshitery this? Student here, windows open buildings really aren’t old. Maybe it’s district district thing? 

Also, I’m almost positive room one door needs rescue window. wish well. know people travelling etc. I'm hearing deaths hospitals, heart issues. wholeheartedly agree find interesting even post anything half offensive this, post gets removed. happens over. would mad virus, local health departments mitigation measures. amazing, able read, still mean understand, totally amazing. 10000 people died perfectly healthy comorbidities saw it.

Was preparing response.

You claim 1 state higher average excess deaths proves anything? really doesn't

This thing went 2 million dead Easter....which happen.

Then Million end summer...which happen.

Then 'IF EVERYONE WORE MASK' mask mandates months growth prove wrong.

So it?

Either disease forgot kill people like March. really bad counting cause take shoes instead implemented Nazi level interments somehow pat backs say something?

That friend, bullshit smelling. Why? What’s changed? evidence literally 4 cases reinfection 25 million cases known reinfection, pretty easy “denier” evidence. Meanwhile grandmother polio ruined quality life twilight years. Long term affects real. place hit hard far seen second wave yet. leaves hopeful herd immunity achievable fewer deaths hospitalizations feared. well? still six months.

And Desantis gets way probably less crowded too. :( Ah, guess 1918 pandemic also hoax. Right? Right? That’s assuming vaccine can’t developed, coronavirus isn’t like flu way doesn’t go away warmer months. 50% Americans comorbidities like obesity. Sure ya bud pandemic within 12 months, vaccines available worldwide.

In countries (e.g. USA UK) may within 6 months, get vaccines first.

The economy bounce back people go freely, travel, go clubs, pubs, shows sports events.

And importantly, try avoid listening doomsayers, many occupy subreddit. state doesn’t union, professional organization offers legal support needed. 

I’ve person 4 full weeks. Masks mandatory students, teachers. I’m exhausted - mentally physically. That's ignorant you. Thousands thousands people died horrible terrifying deaths, telling people ""don't worry fun""? 

There something seriously wrong you. expense talent? think isn’t enough TALENT dying go teaching?!?! Hhhhhahahhhahhahahahhahhahahahhahhahahhahaha *Cries adjunct* everything underreported india. infrastructure western standards. It’s improved bit past two decades it’s still yet Oh, it’s great US that’s woke! 

/s ASSume away! ""I'm good. wait safe.""

In boat, minus toddler/infant (my kids school aged), plus remission cancer. tell people asking I'm gonna go back teaching. therapist got truthful ""I'd rather farmer, honestly.""  average now? What’s fancy Ivy League word I’ve never heard What's shit pay? I'm teacher teach 100% online year, love it. made curriculum adjustment came together me. took fuck load time effort make digital curriculum though. Honestly penitent professor kind asset. owes now. Peru list Brazil  don’t really unions. negotiations. state law, contracts. Teachers make like they’re people work. reminding people American ""beer"" exist Yet 40% adults dying this. vast majority people exaggerating risk. it’s general comment. house senate spending wasting time increasing foreigner work visas green cards instead helping, um, American citizens. 

House: HR.8089
Senate: S.386

How bills helping work Americans bringing foreign labor recognise me? might able get anti body test see really time I've read many stories people who've gotten sick twice they're checked ""that happen"". thing happened pets. around long enough, enough testing know happening larger scale not. sumo wrestlers Well, :) 

Thanks proving point.

Edit: ss case US like “hold beer” Hmmm. UoA classes began 5 days earlier rate 1 33. LSU mandating testing. UoA is. I'm certain that's difference. countries comparable. Take worldometers. Sweden 9th.

Lol okay Ben Shapiro Wuhan (capital Hubei Province), Hunan. (it's Hunan ""wet market"" Wuhan, confusion understandable)

Still, that's point well taken.

Animals like pangolins reservoirs viruses can, little mutation, humans great deal harm.

The way forward seems better job two areas:

1) Putting lots resources studying viruses animals carrying around.

2) Preventing spread zoonoses educating people handle animals sanitary ways. . . maybe convincing folks stop eating (or huffing whatever) certain things. add resume.

The government decided bring forward launch programme Covid-19 pandemic, hit Spain hard devastated economy, causing queues food banks swell.
  
Of 750,000 applications filed since June 15 government started accepting requests, 143,000 -- 19 percent -- analysed 80,000 approved, according social security statement issued August 20.
 

 
'Months waiting'

The social security ministry really analysed 6,000 applications 74,000 households already receive financial aid awarded basic income automatically, added.
  
For hundreds thousands households, wait stressful. Marta Sanchez, 42-year-old mother two southern city Seville, said applied scheme June 26 heard nothing since.

A spokeswoman ministry acknowledged rhythm ""was perhaps bit slower expected"" said government working ""automate many procedures"" processing times become faster on.
  
""The launch benefit always difficult ... situation exception,"" added.
  
But Molina said new situation, made worse years budget cuts public service lost 25 percent staff past decade.
  
""The problem rushed everything, without training huge lack staff,"" added.
  
The social security branch charged basic income scheme 1,500 civil servants, also process pension applications, Molina said.

About 500 temporary workers recruited reinforcements assistance limited status civil servant, cannot officially approve requests financial aid.
  
Demand expected increase. government said measure expected benefit 850,000 homes, affecting total 2.3 million people -- 30 percent minors.

Yay teachers! pre inspection team. investigators yet.

And evidence think still around wont weeks china last 6 months whatever want? Spanish Flu incredibly deadly even young healthy people. death rates young people corona low - vast majority even get symptoms, let alone go hospital. Almost none ICUs. sane states. walked day mask rate 80% outdoor environment even 250k deaths USA.

The models March predicting 2.2 million deaths without intervention, looks like we're pretty good. Well, [it answering question. making claim, defend it.

What important feature type mask, electrostatic properties? Lockdown skeptic crowd force lately. sad mods dont aggressively crack them. lots totally valid questions sub get buried people allowed linger around. Dang, yall Americans dramatic touch Why? make trash pay get health benefits working environment extremely high risk coronavirus exposure? governor *tried* force teach in-person. Multiple school districts went online anyway suing. Also, Iowa reported 2,600 positive tests Friday, COVID Kim give Iowa City waiver go online since University Iowa college students fueling spike cases irresponsible partying. also closed bars. It’s shitshow here; leadership GOP controls executive legislative branches. Why? trust CDC source? VN here. Pretty much normal except wear masks public places. Oddly enough don’t bars, clubs movie theaters.  Name vaccine phase 3 data stoppped vaccine. asked question million times one find one example. Know why? Almost vaccine pass phase 3 fail funding production never side effects. Unlike New York Banks failing people depositing money using credit cards. Shows matters say economy failing mean tell stand big green dot supermarket checkout still get COVID? Chill guy, everything revolves around Americans Unlike USA, ship back ever come from. Yeah NY 30,000 people die lockdown. bottom line everyone's getting fucked unless culture everyone follows rules willing lockdown close year.



Florida 3000 cases per day 1.5 months ago 12,000 per day. Hospitalizations less half peak deaths starting decline. That's see articles headlines like instead articles bashing current state Florida. love this. wish people brainwashed thinking virus worse is. third time ask stop violating site wide harassment rules leave alone. 

Stop harassing me. Dang! betting Oreos Pabst Blue Ribbon. Umm, that’s union. can’t fire someone they’re old. 

There’s virtually tech training schools. Maybe instead firing them, make technology training priority. okay we're going pretend meant nothing ""for obvious reasons too"", absolutely nothing signalled all, lol. don’t use laptop. Use tablet. 

I’ve done big group meetings/teaching young kids via ring central. wasn’t monumental task. Let say upfront know absolutely nothing, live NYC think least population-wide resistance now.

While lockdown never anything notional, since May businesses started reopening, many people back socializing (albeit mostly outside). Mask wearing remains spotty, particularly transit (ghetto trash course refuses comply, there's enforcement). protests/riots/looting. People parties, travelling beach houses, that. despite that, testing shows continued decline virus prevalence. We've 1% positives weeks.

Obviously things could change. School reopening big concern (they might yet push back). things bizarrely calm right now.

Last heard (late spring), blood samples suggested 25-30% city residents antibodies. grow water intensive crops drought prone California. even us consume fucking cows eat. hate argument: “They don’t even care human rights USA.” Really? Typical redditors anti-US propaganda. Every citizen U.S access basic human rights. Discrimination illegal. Slavery illegal, etc etc. human rights US lacking? there's order I'd take great pride disobeying. Let's continue treat cops educators like shit see society lands smh early team does. investigation team do. Fine. get vaccinated get virus receive treatment, die. give two shits them. I'll first line get vaccine whatever boosters recommend. know set october arbitrary limit, think i'd rather tell know certain currently justifies us throwing hands air saying there's nothing else consequences wrong potentially high.

is long term immunity developed? - long? covid-19 reasonably vaccinated against? remain dormant system, looking timebomb here? actually know there's value caught virus setting people wave wave incremental organ damage? associated long term health risks need take consideration outright death? virus likely seasonable? plans place provide people remaining safe getting back work contradictory? social distance kids at-risk parents?

a weeks ago told kids spread virus, know schools opened exploding case numbers; even know sure whether ""treatment"" we're giving people going kill - got october that's fucking important lol? Aww come on, don’t like that! So, willing give car now? need days? incredible amount vert well organized detailed information here- age groups infection, hospitalization death. Well worth look. Sharing information CDC website? Lol no, already virus takes time multiplied high enough body detected. cases tested negative first 14 days quarantine 2nd test positive developed symptoms. **250,000 excess deaths** tells us ""sick"" people would still alive today also contract Covid-19. would tough, data incomplete, quit job. won’t die injure Learn use word gaslight instead Reddit misuse already discussed yesterday: talk go away. Wow think we’ve reached new low mental fortitude extra disinfecting wearing mask greater good society makes want yourself. hope get better go see therapist. EAP friend  Florida reported 9000 cases days reopening shut public reporting numbers.. stop fake news. country interest interpreting virus started ? Good know, Chinese spokesperson.

Ok, changing tune. First said prepare, implying came back, would go Wuhan.

Now saying going all? say investigation origins, even takes years, start immediately? Unless something hide, guess.

But keep howling fake, bot Thats good question. downvote good questions. article Dr. Larry Bush says FDA looking whether trial bypassed altogether vaccine approved using ""emergency utilization access."" Bush says FDA usually approves vaccine using results U.S. trials, conducted countries said ""there group people"" high levels federal government pushing bypass trials. 

What sounds like political pressure FDA use foreign trial results (which presumably already underway end faster) rather wait bit longer US trial results completed.  

This good thing. Rushed vaccines found dangerous subset people fact. example, swine flu vaccine rushed approval British couple years ago, later found resulted permanent health damage people. testing would increase probability detecting type cases. Alabama = low IQ, obese China  stop. Harris poll American osteopathic association says 2 5 Americans doubt vaccine safety. anti vaccine movement growing insane pace, spending misinformation goes it. Almost every school male teachers. tons them. creepy part you. Decades discussion EU regulations FDA regulations. It’s common knowledge EU regulations FDA. current president even ran deregulation. change biden woke looking comments, realize initial comment made different person apologize assuming you.
It’s equally disease poor 10x people 50 died 50. It’s definitely age you’re right can’t ignore factors confuse society government. 

Would like shit talk directed Trump include you?

We're people like you. say horrible shit like say anything might well get thrown them. Sure, true Scotsman fallacy. Whatever makes feel good. Moderates centrists voted trump hrcs failure get swing states fucked us over. Deny reality want.

But hey, long work house thats perfect. Lots upvotes ""look giving example"" poor people flood public transports. Make sure post social media. that's news Shithole, USA. Teaching kids online completely different college students adults it. aren’t even comparable. don’t know use computers, trying get need hard, can’t expect figure like adult would. don’t know find fill assignments. lot barely type. time management skills, getting come back different meetings challenging. don’t really know take notes. 

It isn’t ANYTHING like meeting online training. can’t talk hour. wondering well.... Germaphobe one first things thought Covid began pandemic people required wear masks possibly exposed flu. School kids example. Many times school sent emails (x) amount kids bc flu...why whole classrooms tested possibly stop spreading? wonder going change guidelines ANYONE airborne illness could potentially spread one another. Yes, understand that. point. scary used call virus hoax. downvoted? Governor Reynolds special kind orange cock gargling evil. “Stupid” easy out. Good luck it. kids suffering lack pretty much everything well. wouldn’t send kids even school open. survive make this, personally wouldn’t risk catching kids catching it. 

I hate sound bad heard reports children dying long lasting issues like breathing problems recover? vaccine due beginning year. kid can’t wait then? really don’t want get virus. doesn’t kill you, could end “long hauler” stay sick months, recover die weeks later blood clot issues life long. Check out:

r/covid19positive (they updated month include dont want *any* kids problems. scares me, im scared you. esp since youre higher risk. Jesus Christ 1. presume know vote. live city taxes go towards schools come housing. **I've literally voted give taxes duration home owner.** many neighbors. last tax passed levy citywide preschools, state even support universal preschool.

2. **I fucking teacher.** I've bitching fucking terrible teacher **about 15 years point**. got teaching combination school district hiring freeze time kids, said kids (one neurotypical, initial reason delay going back). 

I loved work helping kids enough volunteer work district, knew teachers get enough fucking help support school, including mine. literally anymore *I fucking cancer doctors told around kids immuno-compromised*. 

3. Around district, demanded (and obtained) remote instruction, even though county one Covid transmission going summer. *I literally prepared keep kids home 2 years means teachers risk dying, matter hardship.*

So yeah, I'm gonna mention life death is, I've bitching teachers expected literal shields kids school shooting since Sandy Hook, I've complaining fund education enough serve kids individualized instruction need decades. questions? ""For 6% deaths, COVID-19 cause mentioned. deaths conditions causes addition COVID-19, average, 2.6 additional conditions causes per death."" indication thing. Asymptomatic people able spread virus, cases may super spreaders. There's glut women degrees education areas. plenty replace them. However, may actually make wages go up, since labor supply decrease. Wish could upvote more. Sorry downvotes man. wish could help.

Also, find full bullshit everyone screamed lockdown protesters peacefully protesting cars, cheering *other* protesters (in much larger numbers btw) unsafe. Exactly. colleges afraid sending students home? Surely reason collect virus samples try understand originated, like previous outbreaks gaslit point drinking bleach, anything possible lost pay? I’m worker cant work home. Using anecdote example, newsagent fellow staff commuter town winner city center newsagent loser. big loser though commercial property owners city centers. balance think net loss economy merely fairer even redistribution spend sucked big cities. terrifying spreading way is. posted information separate comment nurse know used info go rant corona US politics hoax.

If anything, means 6% death certificates filled correctly person thoroughly examined, mere presence virus, virus, system kill you. It’s definitely cure though. president said so? bad im locked small room can't go run go gym exercise. Hey guess pushups situps like prisoner. US cozied SA LOOOOOONG Trump, mean?! doesn’t get reinfected final resting place

Or 1,457,338 them. guess what? It’s going happen. Everyone going wear mask 80-90 degree weather outside drop it.

Them stay inside. people get force much risk suffering must vulnerable take burden wearing masks outside??? See argument makes sense??

No, see point think making.

Putting mask increase risk, prevent people participating society, etc.

Insisting wearing mask means anyone living with, working with, actually elderly, weight, diabetic, etc cannot fully participate society. Millions people allowed part society behalf comfort.

So no, see point, think cruelly insensitive think wearing mask bad forced self isolate.  CDC Says ARDS contributed 22,000 deaths Covid-19 death certificate. ARDS certainly comorbidity. additional condition get getting covid. (Right?) Tests accurate. Many false negative positive. Monkey see monkey 29.0 minute delay fetching comments.

^(Parent commenter ) [^(delete message hide They're trying bungle speak: stories? I'm sure buy conclusions here. true, city like Pune India get antibody prevalence (and assume actual exposure virus higher population, since blood tests detect antibodies antibodies already faded away)? think everyone gets COVID realizes it?  “allies” virtually entire world: business Saudi Arabia, like almost every developed country world business that. States sides requested point. What’s point. Impossible forever. Restrictions drop pandemic over. countries dropping mask requirements already like China. Don’t worry that. think comorbidities would accurate word choice. many black people included eu trials? Wrong. Movement help recover quickly infectious diseases, help prevent pneumonia. don’t need much movement though. Walking around would enough sick. cannot walk legs moved bicycle motion them. important lie one position prolonged period time. Heavy exercise never prescribed advised though. COVID novel, old advice may fit particular disease. Doctors still learning works.  mean training something serious can’t take days mildly sick learn push it. Professional athletes play sick time, aren’t allowed take sick days games practice unless really sick. It’s doctors call incentive team make compete whether feel not. recently basically expected professional athletes play concussions, would let stop flu? Maybe help people reevaluate priorities. 

And truthfully, often feel better exercise I’ve got cold something serious. Sweating getting blood flowing sometimes helps. times clearly case err rest light gentle exercise like walking. People college kids move parents too. Alright. doesn’t change fact might still acceptable Sweden. Yes, unreasonable. kids idea like keep locked inside year social interaction. harm covid ever could.

Mind business. ...and obvious clue talking about. Tell teachers prevent kid contracting coronoavirus strict rules can't r.e. children.  might want complain administration, teacher's decide shit comes policies procedures. Educate yourself. 40,000 new cases day 40,000 new cases day dude.

You said control months, yet numbers decreasing month. increasing therefore control that.

Further, control numbers low enough implement effective pooled testing essential industries even worry nonessentials. assumed taking today's numbers proof Politicians though. exactly point post? know comorbidities huge factor, people dying wouldn’t hadn’t contracted covid. So...is implication anyone underlying medical condition doesn’t matter? shouldn’t worry deaths? 

Also citing public information available since pandemic started acting though someone “admitted” something scandalous laughably stupid. know like 99% survival rate 94% 1% deaths 2 1/2 comorbidities. reason this. bunch bs. Clearly means refrigerated trucks parked hospital parking lots optical illusion planted radical left.

Alright yes NY hit hard (about double Swedens per capita currently), mandate somewhat heavily. I'm glad brought past month single digits Sweden, NY past month 4 days double digits. great improving. also population 412 residents per sq mile. may say packed like sardines bit.

Australian ‘Covax’ sounds better me, side-effects. actually minority, thanks assuming. eyes law, however, equal. access human rights. course doesn’t happen way time. evil forces disobey laws - racism, discrimination, prejudice, unlawful shootings unarmed civilians name recent major ones.Those forces met punishment. say U.S doesn’t “care” human rights wrong. even slightest discrimination work place gets fired days. entire country getting judged actions evil people. majority us condemn things. 

I’m saying one person like U.S. I’m saying human rights get violated. act like don’t human rights wrong. could go longer thorough discussion wish explain further. True enough would still less severe - fantasy scenario also completely fucking irrelevant Spanish Flu *did* kill old vulnerable. exponentially higher death rate every age COVID. 3,000 Ethiopians deported Saudi security services back Ethiopia first ten days April leaked UN memo said 200,000 follow.  moratorium placed deportations international pressure brought bear Riyadh.

OK, so, genuine question: mostly migrant workers family Saudi Arabia, would international pressure return Ethiopia? mean, obviously best scenario would Saudi Arabia keep treat well, seem likely happen. I'm thinking detention center, would rather go Ethiopia. 

I guess sending 200,000 people anywhere bad, destabilizing idea, probably especially now. worse this? Obviously I'm missing point. live Texas. Yet le redditors fully embrace people &amp; ideals label outlandish names presenting facts. I'm pretty bummed able gather family Christmas. We're basically 100% sure nothing change December, right? yeah. someone 25 want find purpose, home, kids, independence, meaningful work, companionship. /s imagine culture puritanical history hates fun. Source: get many dirty looks fun public I'm depressed shit human touch I've since February doctor old guy groping me. I'm still going out. barely leave bed point. Mental health excuse. fucked day😢 That's viruses work, bud. case would take ideology extreme treat fellow mulims well regardless color.

As long say aren’t TRUE Muslims, justify actions Islamic remember basically sent residents Covid isolation camps test positive, either recovered died. hot zones like Wuhan military lockdown ppl even leave apartment buildings. blogs living show exercising running flights steps allowed except groceries. basically like city house arrest army rifle point. could never kind lockdown US. hash tags Reddit lmao would provide links back up. Children shown higher viral loads infection seem infect lungs like adults. Consequently, don’t spread disease easily. Children fewer Ace2 receptors lungs lungs don’t get infected don’t shed virus there. citation Ad Hom attacks acceptable form formal debate would great. course you’ve already forgotten original point resorted logical fallacy, that’s m.o. facing long term consequences, risk unleashing another virus world. need make sure spread manufacturing this. get al masks, resources get virus gonna say. Given farms tank fill liquid nitrogen semen? I'm sure medical facilities gonna fine. We’re nation lazy idiots. Sweden looking pretty good right now. interpret success? Answer questions, stop bothering me. answered your's, turn.

Otherwise, stop bothering me. saw article early explaining using smoking example builds up. even explained 6 foot rule entirely correct. Yet, somehow everyone started holding strict rule completely ends virus. see videos pictures snapchat, endless posts different people showing talking going parties, traveling, going dates strangers. not. poor, concept food even extend meat anything garnish except special occasions. Poor people think killing rhinos horn would even sit without ever eating decades priceless them. guess thinking is, far ahead Moderna they’re rushing it? really, everyone's gonna get point there's way avoid it, do? link source that?  know “exacerbates” it, sure caused wouldn’t nothing Covid systems. say right now, don’t know extent causes exacerbates symptoms person vulnerable to. Speaking anything fact point reckless. Either way. nothing see Wuhan. answer global pandemic, nothing important. Move along. Also Hongkong China move along, nothing see here. 
In seriousness, incompetent organization anyways bears point visit anyway.  believe entirely. Sure, going lunch much working home, spend much travel, company paying 13,000 sq foot office power bill. that's money that's spent wasteful items.

What workers mind production? Put price that! commutes. Longer hours job now. Dogs happy owners. Better/cleaner environment.

So hell money lost, human gain change? Money lost email became popular. complains now? students, families too! virus keeps giving. wrong you? mean, literally issued EUA convalescent plasma Hahn lied efficacy national TV doctors publicly pushing back authorization lack quality data. Hahn resigned right we’re what, third FDA commissioner pandemic? 

The damage FDA likely outlast pandemic. kills young healthy ppl doesn’t kill old vulnerable ppl would say DeSantis still governor situation vastly improved, what’s point lol. think they're gaslighting you?

Your theory hold. Wuhan then? not? soon shut gyms made drinking beer mandatory required us eat nothing Dominos every meal!!!!!111 real? virus kill healthy young people severe one kill old vulnerable? I'm one invading countries steal resources. Nice try, though. cows Saudi Arabia?! don’t numbers, %+ way now? Less tests could mean less sick people request test. 

Does anyone data %+ 12,500 versus 3000? feel like can’t mention test numbers without also including %+. 

The province live couple little spikes testing went way up, spike testing went back less people requesting tests. %+ didn’t change throughout, drop tests literally less infected people.

Edit: looked would seem Florida’s %+ follows new cases pretty closely. suggests reduced testing isn’t affecting drop new cases, there’s fewer sick people request test. OP’s theory might far off. wasnt person saying peanuts. arguement points. point trying make teachers paid 10 months year, regardless spread 12 months not. I'm sure wife ability live Canada probably much different experience had. Maybe stay country improve it. everyone gonna get sooner later turns can't survive it, that's probably gonna happen. 1).

I would still avoid sharing unventilated space 10 minutes even mask distancing It‘s interesting “Islam“ - politicised / weaponized - far scripture “Christianity“. Says guy painted westerners brush. exactly everyone else. hypocrite, nobody listen to.  answer reading properly.

You answer still keep saying go China site made difference? 

I never said site makes difference, asking this? Put straw man bots invade Reddit trying make seem like China open country earth welcome information dissent. 

What about? China worst threat free world faces right now. keep making shit me? make point like adult? firewall.

A firewall basic part cyber security suite. one, should.

Now, answer questions? incapable defending stance rational manner?

The main investigation started yet. know go there?

To what?

What think pre investigation team wuhan?

Or want go sake going there? really sounds like want go optics.

And evidence think still around wont weeks china last 6 months whatever want? illegal, death appropriate punishment crime. based observance outbreaks there's limited window time air room still harbors enough viral load infect subsequent occupants. much time really know hvac systems &amp; room sizes vary opportunity aerodynamic researchers setup live demos infected covid subjects. “Reddit Immunologists expected immune response generated initial infection could prevent second case, least stave severe illness. That’s occurred first known reinfection case, 33-year-old Hong Kong man.” 
But amateur immunologists: 
“What caught experts’ attention case 25-year-old Reno man appears contracted SARS-CoV-2 (the name virus causes Covid-19) second time. Rather, it’s second bout serious first.”
Does fit well, first real case

Data lie! report national case series 11 virologically-confirmed COVID-19 patients experienced second clinically- virologically-confirmed acute COVID-19 episode. According clinical history, discuss either re-infection reactivation hypothesis.” prefer shouted word, “NANI?” course is, right November disagree, easily misunderstood

Edit: Actually look based death certificates. Influenza pneumonia listed 68k. guess indicates lack testing anything else... doubt tested both

Obesity listed 5k, although 30% Americans obese

Diabetes 25k don’t read good celebrate yet keep “India ramping testing” said since May numbers still haven’t improved. Claims testing 1 million per day made since May too, it’s “amazing” considering population you’re talking about. per tests per million stat, India testing 8 million people match US’s daily test rate. India hasn’t increased testing now, it’s going peak. “Sophomoric”, nice personal attack, guess argument didn’t merit. Make obligatory US flights. Thanks! I'll talk wife. really wants in, denier. explanation seems blame administrators like they’re Hollywood style ‘evil warden’ Shawshank Redemption. problem much broader admin struggling cogs. can’t choose brighter path shit additional budget teachers get smaller classes, plan time, reduced legislative scope creep job requirement (dealing IEPs, mandatory reporting, parents, etc.). Problem societal, funding based local voters vote property taxes, etc. SARS 3.0 going infect 0 people everyone dead then. They're testing less less sick people requesting tests. Percent positive 12.5% peak uNlAWfUl AsSeMbLY. patients tested negative multiple PCR tests SARS-CoV-2.

that multiple PCR tests.

and no, PCR tests appropriate tests hospitalized patients done lower respiratory sampling hospital much accurate NP swabs outpatients get.

and nobody tests t-cells diagnostically, reading much twitter, know anything this.

and need seriously fuck back r/conspiracy nonsense. went herd immunity route without looking back. studies saw published couple months ago longest virus lives surface 6 8 hours. Assuming store closed 12 consecutive hours nobody viable virus left reopens. fall victim anecdotal evidence. YouTubers watch carrying normal make living mean anything. killing last rhinos aphrodisiac horn know happens. 33.4% believe vaccines getting pre-clinical Phase 3. guy right vaccines make Phase 3 specifically high percentage succeeding jog get vitamin supplements schools opened back early August, waited till later month. places open around 10th seeing big local spikes. Told so? self-congratulating Jacinda kept total number deaths New Zealand less Sweden last two weeks.

Whether talking case loads, intensive care usage, deaths, New Zealand absolutely demolished Sweden, even per capita basis - hundreds times fewer cases deaths.

Tegnell et al., nothing congratulate over. strategy lead thousands unnecessary deaths.

And yet. Cuomo literally making book covid, didn’t lead world worst response acting like it’s going come back lol. guess holding *all* leaders accountable, picking ones based affiliation, bad thing now. Lmao even read studies? blatant case willful ignorance I’ve ever seen. FDA finished current administration. anyone connected Corona Virus. political explains deaths multiple causes Oxford already begun enrolling people trials around world, searching higher infection rate places. also two doses tests, receiving one believe. posted thing Sounds really scary say like [but really look scary less scary look [individual appreciate this.  America 

Doesn’t us force migrant kid drink toilets fired sent jail? even thread horrible Saudis are, can't contain anti-US ressentiment. 

""The US even invade Saudi Arabia. They're real villains!"" explains true virtually deaths natural cause Doesn’t us migrant kid drink toilets add said, benchmark funding is. 

Standardized testing score results give district part funding state following school year. 

The states dont want give money schools unless perform certain level. I'm maintaining baseline education, tying funding ludicrous. hurting education system citizens.

It makes learning money enough itself. 

All this, ofc, course back funding education whole. enough go around, schools fighting it/competing gets paid. 

I think everytime see article many billions dollars military asking ( support military damn) Pentagon flat misplacing money. huge companies getting bailouts they'd survive fine little bottom line. 

Do know many school supplies buy $1 million? lot. answer lot. 

I'll get soap box now. Prion diseases contagious. going show problem maths analysis now? apologise blatantly misquoting me? make counter-argument own? RemindMe! 1 year pointing see public results agreeing guy  
  think you’ll glean phase 1/2 data?

Safety Phase 1/2 for? There's lot learn safety profiles early trials. one example, Moderna's explains went specific 100 ug dosage amount 3 dosages trialed. school district Oregon decided pandemic good time cut number elementary music teachers district one. One cover 4,000 students grades, classes. music teachers fired rather assigned teach regular classes subjects trained teaching qualified teach. course friend wife's who's teaching 30 years decided time retire. want wait find stuffed barrel thrown sea without life preserver. main loss everybody working remote human element building relationships colleagues. couldn’t give rat’s ass corporations policies, places great team spirit simply can’t replicate remotely. It’s face face, also activities breaks/lunch facilities Seems happening globally. 

Anecdotally around me, ones moderately unsafe getting safer got used (after getting reminders etc around them, getting used masks, etc) We've also self imposed isolation cases someone know infected, stuff like that. feels lot less crazy July I'm at, partially people know someone caught Rona, making feel real encouraging precaution. Distancing also comes naturally, feel, feels less like something purpose (stressful) natural (more sustainable). Let's see keeps up. went school law make smart. IQ focused one area. mean stupid categories life. I'm super good computer stuff suck arts crafts. See? remember Chris Cuomo it, saying staying active helped feel better. think meant full exercising said stayed moving around.

Maybe got lucky. use excuse racist, fucking bigot. saying welcome favor.

It sounds like anyone favor, rather parroting headlines actually understand.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* going show problem maths analysis now? apologise blatantly misquoting me? make counter-argument own? went extremely bad bad, improvement relative. agree increased mask compliance helped simply people figured it’s hoax. daily Covid deaths stayed 10 since July 19 

Well done!

Sure, deaths last two weeks New Zealand total... clearly strategy paid numbers like that! case, local supermarket (owned Stop &amp; Shop) much “wet market” sells live lobsters. 

Unless buy lobster frozen, way buy live. still risky though. Even places relatively low numbers open schools responsibly [otherwise things could easily spiral virus spreads exponentially. true, Jim ran right cliff. Rip. isn’t, average school district job fair teacher position line 30-80 people, one fucking position.

Again, idea you’re talking about. Bingo. article post misinformed, petty agenda. Frog legs considered delicacy East Asia Southeast Asia, even buy Chinatowns across US. considered wild known vector zoonotic infections. businesses closed? Bars, indoor dining? schools? pretty much except elliptical bike. u.s. care too. Like really matters u think incest born. Wrong. disinformation that's easily disproven reading actual table. saying different? statistic truly matters deaths per capita, NY amd NJ forever king there.

AZ tried though. lay people media business reporting developmental drug trials. 

Just think you’ll glean phase 1/2 data?

You’re far depth you’ve already drowned. Scott Gottlieb also said would reach herd immunity january. doesnt know shit honestly think bought paid for. reached herd immunity imbecile. Lets start USA making billion dollar arm deals Saudi Arabia one many reasons kids virtual school year. trust parents keep sick kids home. used volunteer elementary school regularly would see many sick kids school. hear kids saying things like, ""I threw seven times last night"" morning meeting. Yeah, son hit eight absences couple years ago got certified letter district basically scolding us. Kid flu year- I'm gonna send school flu??? I’m worth coworkers putting in. 

Well said. much higher death per capita New York New Jersey? New York’s death per million like three times Sweden, correct?

Sweden’s single digit deaths(often zero) per day last month. going get second wave. holding pattern success. Meanwhile US death toll continues drag along. Likely deadlier mutation died off, might something similar Sweden it’s said done New York, Democrats, Cuomo horrible job murdering nursing home patients. you’re even making sense, there’s thing “physical tests”. doesn’t matter many tests India day population 1.3 billion, conducting 8 times many tests keep world average.


I thought India “outtesting everyone”, would need increase testing case? still false. lists pneumonia, respiratory failure, cardiac arrest comorbidities. can't reach conclusion with/without comorbities table deaths listed multiple times cause death group. saying 6% people died Covid cause listed one biological results Covid. virus kill? nobody dies flu virus HIV? do, go like reckless person would. would interested see many people barely disease contagious anymore. That's true causes death many states require multiple causes listed, taking account proximate kind term.

Tldr: basically politically biased click bait deceptive source mean, understand not- yeah would perfect. Honestly getting instantaneous case number would pretty cool. HRD saying (I believe) ""conspiracy nuts"" right, something keep businesses closed kids going school. denying ~~good~~. Population matters timing reaction evidenced NY right compared Florida even though Florida's leadership endzone dancing 50 yard line. Well like 50% country overweight, that’s underlying condition, many others asthma? believe read earlier pandemic around 70% US underlying medical condition. [This article huge. can't believe getting traction since good many cycles we're getting positives people contagious. Maybe 90% cases unwarranted. Along bleach drinkers It’s ok bro l1bs relatives fun3r4l China can’t improve US isn’t? kind bullshit whataboutism this? far... one state lol it’s least 200 states considered that’s without tracing  wear mask I'm anti-vax, get vaccinated anytime soon unless thing 100% effective cause shit happen later life. us stop killing none white people


Doesn’t us migrant kid drink toilets Oh! I’m sorry! miss interpreted comment! Interpret alongside fact endured 7th highest death rate world per capita get there. mean, yeah. imagine they're little bewildered going ""guys, showed it, completely fucked up"" No, invaded Iraq ""there good targets Afghanistan"". Iraq Afghanistan either small potatoes unrelated. real problem Saudi Arabia along reason US government keeps protecting them. First thing 9/11 getting Saudi royalty country. Wtf?! Saudi arabia islamic, jews nazis think it’s fact China, lots European countries, etc federal power US

Imagine Trump federal power. would make drink bleach Yeah factors include obesity high blood pressure pretty common U.S. think many deaths. Mexico fallen around 500 deaths per day. peaked Brazil US well ahead Omg. would livid. feel parents though. worked professional jobs used sick time looked passed promotions. creates culture choice go sick also send kids school sick don’t support parents. bad. 
Still Scarlette Fever? kid felt looked like hell. headline (story’s fault, OP’s) dangerously misleading.

Underlying doesn’t automatically mean pre-existing. 100% perfect health get COVID, makes heart explode, “heart go boom” would listed cause death alongside COVID. results coming in? holy fuckall trying propagandize. . said lets see moving next month. Lets see able increase testing capacity. Right volume tests higher. number, tests per million. 

Is true conducting tests? 

Not tests per million, physical tests. 

 increasing testing capacity? Well, shit. suspect infections. child, mother left us home alone. Even kindergartener. Could sick. Puking. Fever. see straight. She'd dose tylenol leave pack crackers open ginger ale bed.

She anyone. socially acceptable then. (I agree it, it).

Now, know people know anyone can't afford sitter miss work. I've considering figured hard hit places, city included, must combination people finally convinced take seriously mask careful kind 'herd immunity' among remain careless.
If that's case, happens next? I'd hate see cautious people lured false sense security getting sick too. Happy Cake Day! numbers going weekend slump, silly look people /r/saudiarabia subreddit say this:  That’s determining reinfection though—if genome virus cultured second time different virus first time must new virus, persistent infection never cleared. It’s possible people sometimes get infected genetically similar viruses we’d trouble determining whether reinfection persistent infection. Ahhh retractions... don’t wear masks... it’s spread aerosol...  hope right place expressing concern asking question. house, clearly see neighbors homes, yards, driveways, etc. it’s relatively new development without large trees. I’ve seeing small clusters neighborhood kids - ages 5 10 - playing closely together. masks, distancing, several different households. They’re outside, still, seems reckless me. Last night, observed gathering next door neighbors driveway 6-8 adults 8-10 kids. fire pit going gathering lasted several hours. gatherings seem even risky knowing kids back person local school now. unreasonable feeling angry this? kicker personally one households involved school’s high school principal wife two young sons. principal preaching everyone social media (Twitter me) safe they’re making keeping kids school everyone part also staying safe outside school. feels incredibly hypocritical us. fact they’re outside enough make “ok”? don’t think case, especially given young ages kids they’re naturally going get close other. Google “T cell immunity”

The operating theory 50-70% us encountered coronavirus similar enough deal well. aren’t seeing many places break 20% antibody prevalence. 

20% antibodies + 50% cells = herd immunity really much sense talking ""strains"" thinking infectiousness, severity, vaccine development? see scientists using word often, usually specific. Like, talk particular mutations like spike protein, words like ""lineage"" ""clades"" topic tracing movement virus time.

I get impression people social media generally trying adapt know influenza lots different subtypes infect people, flu virus antigens mutate rapidly avoid immune system. Yeah, where's freedom? point Saudi Arabia trouble containing covid-19, UN doesn’t want spreading Ethiopia too. 

Ethiopian migrant workers Saudi Arabia usually passport taken rights, basically looked property people. Household maids sold site similar craigslist. detention center evil enough finally get international attention, though. that's relevant people care facts though.

&amp;#x200B;

like....bleach drinkers. good point. accurate description corrupt, criminal, shady fuck ""US politics"" Yeah let’s let SARS virus fester mutate gets even higher death rate? sounds like plan woke genius. 

Every time let expand rolling dice recombine snake, cat, ferret coronavirus form something way deadly. SARS outbreaks 8 30% death rates. possible.

Look I’m scientist would desperately like anyone convince need wear mask socially distance, cannot done critically analyze facts value human life. makes dumb Well one, department education run one family members nation's largest pyramid scheme.

If ""Trump University"" tell enough Trump's approach education, clear one. Read fact check. never said that! Nope all. Al Qaeda even denounced ISIS extreme liking one ideologies Wahhabism. Man stop giving false info :

*If county’s case rate positivity rate fall different tiers, county remains stricter tier.* 

Right economic sanctions forbid this. $3.5 billion year sounds like peanuts. financed raising taxed rich 1%. Heck example, even read Phase 1/2 data front runners right 
       help numbers? Yes. CAUSE deaths? No. reopened guarantee 0 deaths Look, America's politicising topical non-political issue again. make one an...antivaxxer?? 😱😱 Central South Africa stop trading treat ppl like period Alright, established think episode CSI China, going waste time that.

Now questions still answered...

The main investigation started yet. know go there?

What think pre investigation team wuhan? expect anything waste time photo ops.

Or want go sake going there? really sounds like want go optics. yeah, totally want sake there.

And evidence think still around wont weeks china last 6 months whatever want? one “strain” circulating low numbers less severe, it’s unlikely peers caught it. MuH FrEeEeEdOmS!

fuckin idiot Retarded cousin-fuckers.  Making point million people die obesity smoking saying 180,000 dead matter. said that. me.
What disagree disproportionate response COVID we've accepted millions people going die every year preventable causes adolescents likely shot school die COVID. 
You live world there's nuance glib people dying padlocking people homes way safe.
Its like lockdowns, however dangerous harmful mental economic wellbeing worth saves 1 life. cares cancer diagnoses 80% saves one life? cares children can't report sexual abuse home school closed? saved 1 life. cares generation people likely never able pay debt, buy home secure sort financial stability life save 1 life.
We're locking healthy save 80 year olds answer lock 80 year olds compromised immune systems. Please, start overly pessimistic let good enemy great. Would rather get nothing let people die *for sure* rather *maybe*? S.A. fucking ""friends"" US.

How fucking pathetic. Dr Fauci credibilty book (as mine), said month ago US expect pretty much back normal next summer.  big story month ago due controversial firing epidemiologist. routinely test healthcare workers (unlike general population) makes huge bulk tests expected mostly come back negative. presenting numbers represented percent positive total population precisely skew lower even though misleading so. muslims well aware saudi one worst countries terms human rights. look arabic/muslim countries well. Okay. That’s anecdotal I’m doubting it. truth hospital system overwhelmed. never outside New York. length stay drastically well. deadlier strain Rona almost disappeared well. gives information two axis. could sort mentally visualize it.


You want shown dy/dx form? know states outbreaks. talking New Jersey right now. 

But states infected people infected New Jersey?

Seems like matters quite throwing around exponential growth like wins argument, disease spread models significantly complicated A0*ert

They certainly are, comes controlling things, even family 3 4 leaving New Jersey infected spell disaster wherever pass like could explain seeing getting masters theoretical mathematics much understand exponential growth works

I would interested explaining country control last months claimed earlier. already get exponential growth works engineering background. got back there, it’s literally party Asshole world need scientist know rushed vaccines worse vaccines forcing people work know. Also put gyms non essentials, obnoxious. 

But even non essentials pure luxuries cannot closed long without riots. That's opinion, tell percentage non compliance society tolerates. second bars opened flooded, seem like society scared willing give things long time protect people? Recently. stated Murdoch role still absolutely central. commercial companies competing first license vaccine, experts say world would better served waiting comprehensive results showed least 30-50% effectiveness.

This extremely low standard. FDA 50% efficacy minimum. good phase I/II results we've seen far, I'm bit baffled scientists worried low floor. $15k fine enough deterrent. SV likely small fraction overall costs. Make $150k might start listening.

Plus local govts need find way make ends meet w/o much tax revenue, let's make superspreaders pay. poverty country Maybe, always strive better, demand ally with? going lie went Kutztown underground music scene there. scene got swept two years ago collapsed itself, student felt connections made studying worth it, professors impressionable, except Massad strangely... Got education dreams dipped Spring start COVID child type! Bigly, bestest numbers. Winning numbers! Convalescent plasma 2.0 coming through. FDA puts misinterpretation results. Half country goes crazy touting great success. Doctors look data point mistakes. FDA puts correction. half country never hears it. everyone population gets exposed, clear everyone vulnerable 50-100% camps, prisons, boat, dorm/frat house etc. test positive.

That mean herd immunity impossible lower numbers. Heard immunity defined level immunity population required outbreaks self-limiting. point outbreaks. reach heard immunity crowded area, prison, virus still spreading numerous new people, even reproducitve rate 1. different views, big surprise since we're internet. take sarcastic tone away, calling attention Brazil bond-villian charge would bring awareness people maybe get riled it. Activism starts awareness calling attention horrible shit happening another country water down, imo brings wrongdoings focus wider range people. wider variety people affected we're talking it, maybe problems forced change. 

Look what's happening America, half country take action believe might actually effect too. see things infuriates me, people think like that. see headline think ""oh happening africans, nbd.""

It's good acknowledge happening SA, Brazil, America Saudis, brazilians, Americans outraged know front door. 

But no, want reddit comments right way. gatekeeping.

Edit: add, bothered someone pointing parallel human-rights violation, report mods. Seriously, harmful discourse I'll first one support removing it. believe case look cases per day...Florida looking really good negative rate increase... yes title might correct context right Wow look hypocrite Google. necessarily, that's goal. means FDA reviewed data Phase I-III found results promising enough allow made available public, rather wait Phase III fully conclude (amongst things, take many years) allowing made available public. didn’t say did? said media isn’t controlled enough hide serious outbreak Covid. That’s true. Asymptomatic transmission rare Althzemers (sp?) Disease prion disease. pretty large scale threat, even though contagious.

By nature, prion disease years without symptom, there's way stop nasty little mangled proteins. know, there's already massive, contagious prion epidemic silently spreading millions brains, know symptoms start presenting years.

Then again, maybe not. point is, share poster's fear prion diseases. They're poorly understood, transmitted often animal meat, damn hard detect, well researched. contagious prion disease stretch, we'd potentionally world-ending amount trouble one developed. Imagine telling world disease spreading kill 10 years, there's nothing done it? Jesus, anarchy would eventually erupt enough people tested positive... downvoted getting worked offended nothing, following whole paragraph ""what this"" ""what that"".

We're talking US here. countries issues they're relevant conversation.  American website English usually does. already told benefits, planning would need visit sites make plan. site visitations required, go China guess makes sense idiots UK--some lineage crossed North America 300 years ago... Say rest it. Say long people want shut ***nonessential*** parts society.

Because people claiming would forever bad actors like you. Exactly. infuriating. get vaccine, likely fine. part people can't. problem ia people care others. frustrating. right filled crazy idiots countries across world? 

I. AM. SHOCKED.  That’s Rasmussen..... move ass randia. Turd. never said was, responding “the virus isn’t dangerous stacks bodies”. single working mom, feel horribly trapped. No, definition R0 includes nothing related human behavior. entirely function biological characteristics virus, constant. elements DOTS important drivers R(t), R0. Thanks mentioning “feelgood” part. agree you. Feelgood things fact detrimental one’s health safety. We’ve bombarded feelgood things wonder we’re still stuck problems.  Thats fucked, frankly fair. SK japan successfully prevented ""wave"", areas europe one yet another. Areas europe prevented 1st wave getting one now. impression viral symptoms always 100% present every patient? that’s reads, believe mean, data going public anyway. can't get transparent that. Experts fine-toothed comb. Efficacy hard identify. I'm convinced football player drop dead live television fall.  Go back chodi shithole stay never said never need go there. simply would show good will. would show China really interested investigated.

So reason because? actual benefit it? expect accomplish anything, parade around show it? logic holding initial planning place started.

Beacause decisions made CCP investigated.

Now questions **still** answered...

The main investigation started yet. know go there?

~~What think pre investigation team wuhan?~~ expect anything waste time photo ops.

~~Or want go sake going there? really sounds like want go optics.~~ yeah, totally want sake there.

And evidence think still around wont weeks china last 6 months whatever want? That's good question. R0 important upper bound R(t), that's it. Testing cut half people modified behavior. reckless push open schools without restrictions push Florida back 5000 cases day three weeks kill another 8000 Floridians end year. Come snow birds! know? test fellow classmates already? I’ll check back ... remember moment..... new reopening plan insane seems like joke. rate false positive tests alone prevents state ever reopening. get past r/coronavirus admins? sub ignoring China shitting West remember! still blocked studying origins Wuhan. people getting infected Disney going home states recording cases rather Florida. I'd compare Sturgis Disney pretty proactive making sure people wearing masks such, would expect would fewer initial cases never said going happen, said chance post Trump. i’d love Biden change course usual neoliberal policy SA i’m holding breath Frogs exotic, they're pretty commonly eaten China. bullfrogs even called ""field chicken"" (as farm field). fact article point exotic animal actually leads believe close non-story. FDA (and government agencies, including health agencies like CDC) corrupted political pressure. People want truth want DOOM GLOOM. amount people save small shut society.  seeing political pressure US government agencies pretend everything fine dandy, would trust EU more. faith people FDA pressured push vaccone that, pressure, cave like cardboard roof.

I'm saying love Trump, think he's terrible. win EASILY win way looks now, Biden cowers away debates look even worse him.

When programming labor pool becomes super saturated (which is) begging unionize order keep job.

Instead, continue argue self interests, old, company dump 5 new hires thing half price. zero protection comes union.

I still opening. Even assuming single child die -- fact know that..that we're sending 6-12 year old's back school non-zero chance they'll killed deadly virus way properly understanding -- completely reprehensible imo. 

No matter teachers administrators, there's *way* school normal year. Kids horrible prospect hanging heads. building wear masks whole time. *All day.* desks socially distanced surrounded plexiglass. can't get within 6 feet other. leave room circumstance except use bathroom. one kid hallway time. *some* days go outside recess. PE. 

All ""special"" classes (Art, Library, etc) take place regular classroom. can't visit library, gym, art room. They'll eating lunches classrooms well. can't sit together bus. 

And better staying home months we're least *more* sure we've got control? I've saying beginning kids, least elementary, *not* go back school way represents kind normalcy. Anyone ever taught elementary tell difficult get some/most kids cooperating working even good day. Now? really expect kids work circumstances?

And people say important socialization. agree way. Socialization actually believe *the* single important aspect elementary school. kind socialization expect get aforementioned environment? think may actually become *negative* influence way children socialize going forward.

Stay away media. watch one station thinks Covid Democrat hoax going away November, stations think Covid like impending nuclear winter. There’s much going little common sense. try stick scientific studies. r/holup Yeah, America someone profit it, get done.

At end day, it’s still job take much haven’t read article found quick search.

And even none true, get paid poorly work summer job poverty. Nope. Virus come close feared numbers beginning. death toll statistically significant anywhere planet.

CDC even confirmed (what smart person could guessed) lockdown measures causing death (suicides, stress, overdose) virus ever will. Anything possible willfully gullible constituents.

It frustrating could many things took precautions seriously. Don’t worry, us hoping Florida sinks asap. feel like competition see gets cases tallied. I'm married one too. regular classroom stuff, back school PD occurred contract time.  obvious point lockdowns hurting helping. Phase 1 2 trials typically run tandem, typically done competition projects, usually carried massive funding pipeline.

Additionally, majority time usually spent Phase 3 take many years get sufficient exposure without unique situation presented pandemic conditions.

This say nothing fact medical science developed rapidly disciplines recent years. might well talk historical average timespan took map genome. 

It's 1960s anymore. unique situation. Things change. dude taking Europe. Take look Italy spain France UK. went Friday classroom/school Monday teaching fully online. time planning? summer (8 weeks) waited governor decide whether going back person, waited weeks scheduling plans administrators (full day? Half day? Every day? ). Mine finally got decided last week, go back Monday. Again, time planning learning. school starts rolling, think planning/learning teachers happen? they’ve spent 7 hours day controlling teaching 100 kids day?

Or kills them, case oh well. Thanks service. Pune surprisingly high number daily cases. worst hit city India now. TPR also insane(25%). 

Why think Pune receiving end worst covid scenerio within India? mean states like Up, bihar seeing miniscule number cases compared populations. Maharashtra seems worst hit. wonder why? means we're going get used corona season. gator gets eat end. fuck even talking about? fare real world? Teaching isn’t “normal job” you? Masks. Everyone wearing masks. live Los Angeles, maybe bit mask OC, seems like 100% masks store building. Massachusetts illegal us teachers strike. Admin calls strike union not, it’s semantics. Wow.  tell Russia targeting social media. People knowingly spread highly lethal disease mass murderers students part keep repeating assignment get it. fail.

This education system US works anymore. pressure shifted students teachers. justify fail student, justify pass. kids part failure teacher students. Kids care grades learning know long bottom barrel pass much damn work fail them. Good questions. 

First, claim want work... safe... ridiculous. 

We know odds young child getting seriously sick Covid. worse dozen things everyday (well maybe kids days - seems like parents walking bus stop even they're juniors high school, lol). 

This teachers age 55 so. 

For older teachers actual health problem, good solution. would slowly make realize magic vaccine probably going ready soon, ever, Covid part life next years, least.

 want take risk, time early retire reduced pension they're within approx. 7 years it, tough shit not.

A pandemic essentially act God like hurricane tornado. private sector lower middle class workers already taken vast brunt pain, public employees up. Based collapse almost state local tax revenue, pain going isolated teachers. even Biden wins, see Congress passing huge bailout states. know ""dozens""? I'm thinking much pay monitor 50 screaming kids bus every morning afternoon. 

It's well buck fifty minimum wage. Uh. Didn’t work. Father law died May this. family care much COVID. enough connect-the-dots growing up? Didn’t find catch twice? reacting positive diagnosis? big deal? blaming everyone else? Certain jobs seen integral structure American society legally allowed strike. think true fire fighters too, maybe police officers? That's thought months ago. could follow China keep virus check. actually happened mind boggling point pretty much lost hope. key China able control quick testing, contact tracing, hard lockdown needed. look like we're ever going them. even say? want see Betsy DeVos televised education program. government expects children write exams now. teachers getting support admins. takes lot work turn in-person math curriculum fully online one. Administration putting duties squarely teachers

How teacher supposed much give online exam zoom? can't. need additional online tools, again, admin often failing provide went horse show today. far could tell person hundred mask. Social distancing also definitely happening. SUCKS, kind it? actually true - vast majority easily pair fists pair handcuffs, quiet lie told front judge ruins someones life, veiled threat knocking complainants door 2am slowly following victim around town.

So yeah, majority police fire guns victims, often subtle ways inflicting pain. wife's school got masks looked exactly like ass part men's briefs.

They're made Hanes. anxious person all? anxiety manifests physical ways, often upset tummy. stressing makes worse. million different things cause symptoms you’re really panicking, get tested possible. Peace out. People normal jobs either work, go without income. can't imagine teachers would fare real world... Flies sit poop food, spread deseases. Trump thought locking NYC. might worked. However, locking city easy, making sure nobody starve death would required competent logistics. lol. retarded? Coronavirus become another disease here. Thousands recovering home itself. think goal wear mask, fooled.

The goal create biggest theft wealth history.

Take virus normally kills half million people year, blame death virus everyone panicked, print trillions give buddies.

Or something like that. still prefer measured approach opposed believing numbers fake situation secretly getting worse across country. trust overflowing hospitals, would get reported. It’s okay states better. Look! Stupid people aren’t American! imagine teach manage in-person remote learning time—- that’s many teachers CT facing, MANY places gave parents choice, teachers. It’s terrible. least teaching remotely don’t additional stress lives endangered 4 days week.. person every day Wednesday’s- That’s clean Covid’ building. (Never mind it’s building that’s issue much 300 plus people INSIDE it). 

This doesn’t make happening alright either! sounds like horrible stressful nightmare. Like way many teachers, haven’t given support/training/equipment/bandwidth etc teaching fully remotely. students facing version issues.  It’s crap, right complaining well. It’s hard state that’s even option many teachers.  Retire face good possibility catching virus die. Seems like easy choice there.  assume went WW1 what? Holocaust months?

Boil frog man... terrorist. Bioterrorism serious crime. terrorists need face severe punishments. 37,500 go. poor lady Haha, omg love this, find brutally honest/true. stay open guise restaurant. reopen Oh, forgot people decided wait Christmas die again. level interments 

Just fuck off, man. dare you. Lol ya used sub I'd never go back now. already really hard long term assignments low income district poor admin... chance hell I'd reneter environment pandemic. wouldn’t say experience, knowing lots fellow teachers, hit nose proverbial head. half-life appears around 2 1/2 months. antibodies detectable long time. think allowed salons open indoors across yet tier system. It’s reality Yeah that's dumb considering Singapore Malaysia pretty diverse yet see protests. old teachers retiring, bet lot don’t need $ anyway. They’re trying stick around 5 extra years max generous pensions even get little bit extra $ per month die. There's trust anymore whatever going come FDA/CDC. none.

Everything come Trump looked triplicate accepted. 

Which be. absent strict rule. know country, Malaysia police constantly check premises make sure following SOP given, every customer need write record scan temperatures. high compound used given one failed so, direct courts order rich dipshit take easy coz money. night life, large gathering many restriction.  Another fukking governor disallowing communities decide handle public health situations. Brought people like say government problem, small government, states rights, freeddommmmmmmm!!!! 94% deaths attributed Covid comorbidities. underlying cause death identified, unprecedented. Thank world health organization jumped USA Brazil bandwagon economy greater good.

Source: bam, France Italy case counts rise nations remove restrictions.

I'm never ending restrictions corruption. Same. I'm starting year 20 3 schools I've taught district, none windows open. “If stopped testing students wouldn’t cases!” Sounds like needs “COVID symptoms” quarantine several weeks test results come back, go maternity leave “early labor symptoms” last month.

She’s hung dry workplace union don’t care dies. Time return favor. lizard people live flat earth That's enough time implement successful online model. time trained implement new system, troubleshoot it, etc etc, train teachers experience, technically inclined. create documentation parents older kids trained well, talking minimum 7 months year hit ground running without major issues. steal would naive think isolated practice  thought numbers low rural areas testing capacity there. probably spreading like wildfire rural areas too. know what? came back America Asia March. Everyone Asia wearing mask would get temperature checked entering buildings. exiting SFO, noticed ONE WEARING MASK! People looked like CRAZY! 

I guess America wants stay #1!  try! Burned bridges I’m pretty sure neighbors think I’m weird. Whatever. make best decisions can. stfu Death negative outcome sick. That’s know you’re dumb, ones dumb typically also arrogant entitled too, gives Americans undeserved bad reputation helps, born 1961 time got college (women color) still encouraged involved sciences even math. thought ""too hard"" blacks quite disgusting.

The reality is, want better treatment, better drs, on, encourage community. 

Here's proud went; fact majority people working there, black. make feel comfortable? Certainly did!

And yes agree, people's attitudes need work. Blacks cannot afford left behind. work community within.  lots outreach community.  another way that. Ahh. SEC mentality. Got it. 


Sorry, I’d prefer go school focused academics. recruiting people play want watch football. Guess differ important School. least increase attendance, cost attending gone 153 rank (even faculty hasn’t really). would handful reinfections start happening now? Could immunity lasts certain number months, people recovered getting started reinfection? Think it. 154 medical schools USA. rankings change year year, depending specialty ranked extremely highly believe orthopedics. considering state school, really high ranking. tell highly respected medical school. rate, can't seem agree keep others safe... almost seems easier let spread happens, happens

We know elderly fear flu, careful that? Nope. need jerk; factually incorrect, mean opinion? say 1+1 4, people allowed criticize statement ""opinion""? mean ‘git add .’ would add new things. Link unreadable piece shit document. Great! 

I’m sure studies fecal transmission done. I’d imagine India would place relevant. Europe Covid flushed upstairs neighbors toilet ending toilet.

You’re probably going say “but public bathrooms” say, avoid them.

I refuse debate further. plenty idiots Canada too.

Turns anti-science stupidity isn’t exclusive us - it’s people vote lead country. lot people don’t recognize problem it’s late directly effects them. Almost every single Covid denier gets sick says “I wish took serious.” people won’t care death direct family gasping air themselves. Whatever US UK copies slightly watered scale questions, evidence mounts large swaths people symptoms, need focused on: silent eventually serious effects them? so, percentage?

This critical planning needed globally pandemic. Proponent small local government uses big government powers hamstring municipalities. Running doom articles I’m pretty sure he’ll gladly take $569,000 USD fine. Hopefully get reinfection. Bit unfair California. far largest population. third second place (Texas) almost double third place (Florida).

In terms cases per capita, actually tiny bit US average (18,500 vs 17,700). 20th terms cases per capita US.

It's also testing average 280k tests/million. Compared 245k/100k entire nation. course...
As teacher, would willing teach small group students families situations. like movie Parasite one lie leads next soon spirals control WTF? funeral luxury. I, example, plans one. Donating body research. Medical cadavers hard come by. US actually sell body cases. Recycle LOL save money.

""Forced"". citing outdated thinking. like using Titanic itinerary telling using that's way timing get across Atlantic. Again, hard fast rules here, whether like not. theory relativity - extra resources, brain power emergency protocols really accelerate this. that's talking, that's Fauci myriad public health officials across globe.

And course vaccine deemed safe effective multiple authorities get public health nuisance separate society. absolutely think state (federal well local state) eventually held liable debilitating side effects like this.

They let population suffer mass infertility, breathing problems, on?

well okay, we're taking fuckin basic income, shitheads. brown Read room hell Sad true. Yeah that’s correct, bad article Yes heard that. really crazy guess still believing cure Something exception proves rule comes mind. 

I’d view context 25.2 million known infections globally. likely much, much larger number actual infections, including asymptomatic, mildly symptomatic otherwise untested cases.  

This would’ve felt pointless say months ago. Uh-huh. We’ll get right that. Go ahead hold breath. dont know live dense city, everybody acting like covid gone also point Spanish flu, United States put place mitigation strategies helped suffer much less parts world (The death rate US ~0.7% compared worldwide figure 3%). arguably risen level competence current pandemic. could lead one predict that, relatively speaking, suffer long-term effects United States pandemic 1918. rudimentary mitigation efforts might seemed, compared parts world, worked.  Single parents upper class neighborhoods financial stability hire someone stay children they’re work. Oh, stupid spreading.. headline already American dollars sure... India 60,000 deaths total, sure you’re reading 50,000 dying day? mean, would lock would immediately devolve skeptic-fest, since they're pushing misrepresentation article. post intentional disinformation anyway. Maybe generally traffic heavily lies, would fine. stands, mind skipping bombardment falsehoods. Good, banned life then. weakest nursing home people gone.  Nah man they're gonna get Edward Snowden treatment. Demonized media point message dismissed/forgotten. Guess state... everywhere, live pods, teach, teach again, video distance learner due child privacy requirements. Spanish flu killed 3% entire world population. 50 million people succumbed, population roughly 1.6 billion prior pandemic. men susceptible women, women time breadwinners family setting, many dependents thrust widespread poverty wake pandemic flu. Countries adapted science scientific method felt disillusioned widespread death devastation amount time, became slightly less scientific approach embraced alternative medicine much readily. Conversely, countries slow adopt scientific method accelerated adoption.

The divot Spanish flu put economies first world countries massive. economic devastation lasted generation. However, wake devastation, widespread pandemic epidemic surveillance rose fore socialized healthcare became much popular.

Those massive sea changes. world Spanish flu world Spanish flu good bad ways. Laura Spinney lays well 2018 book Pale Rider, talks Spanish flu 1918 positive negative long-lasting effects.

Respectfully, cast historically checkable event something people got went back lives way lives pandemic incorrect. defined actual facts recorded remain observable. Yeah, point waste taxpayer dollars locking up. point ban ever returning. someone actually pays fine that's bonus. already manufacturing big batches vaccines. Depending things sequence, could lots supply ready-to-go approval happens. good football team, that’s want 'better' version? We're still trying get people go beach...

I think actually illustrates important point well. Trying get people go beach indicates fundamental misunderstanding makes situation dangerous. beach good gets ventilation ability spread out. 

I strongly agree consistency messaging critical, handled poorly far. effort optimize though, they're trying course correct. messaging (and mean things like photo beach top basically every article quarantine since May) consistent, misleading comes forming useful conclusions effectively manage risk without total isolation.

Personally think need get point importance ventilation across, try mess distance requirements. real takeaway chart really safe distance poorly ventilated space. messaging, combined trying shift stigma away seen outdoors public spaces, would accomplish everything chart does.  little bit. Honestly, could great model learn place US, due size population land.

South Korea, Taiwan, Ice Land's methods likely unable use US whole. size population land affects lot . Better treatments younger infected cohort. Deaths eventually spike though. observed lag United States. mean, that’s way larger anti-mask rally I’ve heard United States. 

It’s usually hundred dummies. seems reasonable. Anyone violates conditions would fucking asshole moron.  deathsentence still governor though? change heart? getting second strain strain. Derrr.... almost Yeah, mean it’s bombshell article I’ve seen since pandemic started. It’s basically saying minimum half positives likely nothing concerned about. front page news? sure recover lesson learned next pandemic fall habits? would thought almost worst case scenario entire human races action performence stopping spread shown still immature species.  Florida’s plummeting new cases seems fishy. COVID burned funny stuff testing? Years ago applying universities, one first things looked GPA/SAT/ACT requirement. place like Univ. Florida required exceptionally high GPA near 4.0 ACT score 27 even considered possible student. 

Alabama required 2.3GPA ACT score 15 gain full admittance. thats article about. American friends, dumb. Americans dumb damn, sure seems like lot are. said, I’ve run quite dumb Canadians well. someone please start sub screenshot drama queens mock them? No...Article stating phase 1 2 exactly are, test safe human use. Phase 3 data collected measure protection/efficacy.  
Article mentions majority astrazeneca trial volunteers around 30-40yo, best best way measure would miriad volunteers ranging 18 55 different healthiness levels? 
And running various phase 3 testings different approaches different tools, techniques labs... putting data pot would wisest conclusive. Yeah, whole cult spreading fast coronavirus disease. wanna get Mrs. Nomes wild ride. - may true, don’t think removing article takes away ability make case? It’s like article came blog. It’s New York Times. feels like there’s bit picking choosing going based mod opinions.

And get can’t change cycles rapid testing available, governments making decisions policies results test, it’s really important they’re correct. makes sad makes sad know people.

Edit. look like 10,000 people though video titled ""hundreds gather"" magnitudes Gracias! wasn’t 9000 kids, 9000 people entire state. 9000 kids. reaching Yeah beyond thanks. right. would to. problem people getting tested quarantining get results back. mentioned original comment tested like day two first day school, went schools without receiving test results back (most districts counting misses due COVID truancy, that's reason). ""gotta get kids house school matter what"". adult probably one goes office strep flu ""they handle it"" parents taking kids tested positive ones send kids school sick anyway ""you're sick need stay home.""

I hope district taking notes opened already triage situations ""unexpectedly"" popped initial opening. cousin goes there. pooled testing system?

Because without numbers low enough long enough allow that, enough. How's weather Beijing? Pro moves florida Source? ass? Saudi Arabia country world provided FREE healthcare residents even illegal ones somehow type shit headlines make news serves LOT different agendas. Yeah, absolutely think everyone suffering knowing best years, last years, even years life wasted disaster. intend insensitive others struggling. even that's true, poor catching selling animals.

they can't shut things bs poor submission like certain countries Pathetic response. Typical American. Every teacher know parents won’t this. can’t even count many times sick children come school throw within minutes entering classroom. single rushed vaccine safety tested effectively isnt anti vaccine general high death per capita (not rate) dealt quickly. highest worst Europe. US merely getting number less quickly. Uh, lot places overwhelmed. aunt nurse Arizona said nightmare tons mandatory overtime huge issue burnout. I'm Colorado recently take stepdad hospital, bumped quickly could needed space, packed there. Front line burnout I'm afraid right now. slowed manageable level world, health care workers fatigued, retire, sick would-be nurses doctors turn away profession subsequent waves harder deal with. Updated treatment protocols huge advantage course we'll see enough. Proof racist? Camel fuckers r/NoShitSherlock knowledge two strains, G. terms severity, they're equal, one contagious. Uh, sick kids NEVER go school. Western journalism terrible. Misinform public like redditors pull shit asses. People going wilderness catching animals. ""wild"" animals farmed. Why? Because, economical farm animals, numbnuts.

They went farms tested animals checked every source connected Wuhan seafood market. find thing. western media never report that. cases Wuhan people connection contact seafood market. COVID-19 cases France December. People sick US back November tested positive COVID-19 antibodies. Use logic. Maybe COVID-19 already wide spread Wuhan first place detection. Lol look definitely match numbers gave earlier.

Were hoping one would actually read it? cruelty knows end. horrible. point using headline OP straight misinformation, not? disagree point ""The United States entire continent"" simply false. (d^2 p_c )/(dt dp_c), then? I'm aware holding narratives. Thats mad. Yep rocket science. Build lab every college, maybe train students grad students part medical programs. Beaches have, general, open summer CA, outside initial lockdown holiday weekends. yeah.. we're human.

if anything stress manifest wars random agression.

its gonna fun decade alien watching far away simple, ""hey kids, 6 feet apart please"" ""hey kids, dont tackeling other"". couldnt see might work, dont know tell you. Youre lost cause point. Absolutely, area R ~ 1 right reached herd immunity (for example) concerts sports. course are. fuck china China never faces consequences. concentration camps...they started pandemic...they steal tons top secret information trade secrets skate ""oops sorry!"" every single time without change. Fucking finally someone else understands clinical trials. saying everyone thinks  Loony. makes sense vaccines ASAP 

 

 

The overall estimated PoS (probabilities success) industry-sponsored vaccine program 39.6%, 16.3% industry-sponsored anti-infective therapeutic. math wrong. cdc many states countries would disagree assessment virus gone

It has? guess 6,835,167 active cases get memo. Theyve hyping make money since began, lot research teams. Academia sadly driven money nowadays. September wasnt realistic wouldnt surprised latest target isnt either bring mask beach, also generally wear set spot one reasonably nearby. steady ocean breeze good dispersal mechanism. 

I put back walk parking lot. What's got US? issue places work barebones staff first place. Many part time workers get little paid time get penalized calling sick-because normal staffing already short take good care people, facilities can’t afford call outs. Working conditions nursing homes brutal exploitative. hospitals struggled ppe, guarantee many nursing homes didn’t get shit. It’s surprising covid spread like wildfire. Anyone works hospitals know everything spreads like wildfire nursing homes, d/t vulnerable population, close quarters, often substandard care. Link? Since math looks atrocious think forgot medication morning lol. never read book life. know lot people started computer science degrees never finished them. coursework complicated intense. Coding easy. people pick fast. passionate it. Others never understand it. 

I know hate jobs too. salary makes manageable go profession think rainbows unicorns. Wow, someone telling end entire fucking world? reddit? Crazy point factoid universities less-developed testing programs probably fair number cases counted due relative lack testing I'm we're pretty much able everything like normal long mask inside?

Oh yeah? good you. That's case I'm at, want change. People able live lives. Restaurants struggling, movie theaters closed, musicians can't practice profession. You’d surprised. I’ve seen plenty times place employment. parent sent child school knowing sick school nurse school admin called pick up, gave excuse sun couldn’t pick up. child remained school entire day. mom sent school sick two day’s. Child crazy stomach bug passed staff child’s room caused hella call outs. parents don’t give shit. School daycare them. parents itching person learning begin don’t deal child day. think mistaken, he's stupid making comment. must stupid well making comment. Buncombe gave students either plan B (hybrid in-person online) plan C (fully online). Asheville city schools online first nine weeks, everyone else county options. rural areas, parents travel AVL work case numbers haven’t fantastic. weird mix people take virus seriously, people still think it’s joke.

As parent, it’s really frustrating. 1. asthma example hypertension another mean treated collateral damage “for economy”; 

2. majority American adults underlying conditions, known not, pre-diabetic hormone imbalances auto-immune disorders. Chances good too...; 

3. underlying mean pre-existing. COVID 19 caused one’s blood clot easier, died respiratory failure, clotting would one underlying conditions death though COVID 19 created condition first place.

Also, “entire fucking country” hardly closed... FBI  No. 100% safe. still taking precautions, precautions would much realistic able go now. Agreed. Sometimes people like read articles understand like that. women waxes eyebrows complete breakdown me. sounded extremely stressed scared. listened let get out. say anything gave good tip. herd immunity means even 100 imported cases won’t start large outbreak infect average fewer 100 people.
The way get exponentially growing numbers infected region herd immunity (so make look like import exponentially infected people time, that’s logistically possible. Talk year Sturge cases. Trying eradicate COVID-19 isolation social distancing lot beneficial, unintended consequences. flu, common cold could see decrease. Heck, even STI transmission rate could all-time low. son (Pre-K),entering K, tremendously well remote last semester. Maybe growing up. see soon since remote K starting tomorrow. proud Time Person Year 2006. Plus don’t know many coders extremely happy job. think suffers pitfalls every job has. Googled - [deaths per didnt know already though, people discuss basic Knowledge countries top/bottom. understand cultural thing, wow, hoped lesson learned. disappointing need jounce measure jerks charge  ""The mutates, likely become benign long haul""

WHAT?!?! extraordinary claim little support. appears little selective pressure virus become less deadly since window infectiousness almost exclusively long host may die. Let's conversation late fall... It’s every place could leaders focused health Americans. It’s impossible task. say that, said death RATE. Meaning percentage people die given number cases. increase cases, percentage. Unless hospitals completely overrun like suggesting ok happened.

To put even simpler terms you. 1 million Americans get diagnosed coronavirus next month 0.3% expected die. 2 million Americans get coronavirus next month 0.3% expected die assuming hospital's overrun (which been). Thats mean death rate. majority us health

The majority americans probably really healthy.

Just obesity, risk factor, remove already 42% population (CDC data). heroic forced pick grapes middle apocolypse

\*ahem*, correction: They're middle two apocalypses right now. risk COVID risk lung cancer Californian fires. course is. Bill Gates want us exercise want gather finite energy 5G antennas. Idiot sheeps think 5G antennas' purpose spread coronavirus know antennas also gather human body's finite energy. u think got billionaire? Wake sheeple. OP makes sound like courses Code Academy going help someone find job. they're literally sitting gold mine

That's retarded comment here. I'd argue they're literally sitting massive oil field. gold mine? literally encourage help this, also exactly thing do. Yet? Hospitalizations almost 50% since last month. titles misleading show far news fallen mainstream even this.  


Literally talk doctor ICU. Death certificates list: Pneumonia due covid, Respiratory failure due covid, ARDS due Covid, Covid. 4 ""conditions"" COVID. people diabetes/cancer also another condition leading death, see table 7k died getting Covid battling cancer.  


They code multiple things one disease helps CDC figure virus kills people. AIDS kill either directly, causes immune system die cold kill you. 6% death certificates lazy find actual cause besides covid. attack 6% want count them. 

This even preexisting conditions, easily tell 5k people obese died. US like 40%+ population obese. 50k people ""respiratory failure"" prior Covid. doesn’t always work. also caused harm. bs meant reversing decision approve political pressure added. science isn’t good enough it’s easy risk free procedure. Seems pretty clear implication masks part clothing pandemic managed. words friend (a chemical engineer): ""Do like job? Fuck no. afford nice vacations things help enjoy life better. lot everyday stress deal with"" directed malicious people. orders top malicious unfortunately ignorant accept orders uncritically. they're dead set putting people risk, pay get medical support system camp, even means getting another country. country standing army tons rations medical supplies either cycling needs cycle out. Still good could use it. No, understand that. still seeing R ~1 even significant social distancing measures place (AFAIK, NYC still allow indoor dining), probably yet.  one wins argument internet Reported Quarantine's bit much. We're even currently quarantine (in US.) vaccine out, masks social distancing still probably happening cases drop way, way community spread low also take time see effective vaccine large population. Basically, vaccine things still take time relax. course people already relaxed would happily go bar...or motorcycle rally. Almost, want current positive cumulative positive, daily change current positives. estimate doubling halving time. referring image: dumb. Running exercises general mask harmful choose believe whatever narrative fits prerogative. wish people would choose stay home rest us move lives. Lockdowns work. Social distancing work 1% population disease. Masks work viruses. recovery rate 99%. 10k children starving month direct consequences lockdown. economy completely obliterated. whole thing joke. go believing MSM, part it. Yes. Like Sweden. Lol I've saying would happen since March. exact reason really cold states get hit harder flu's random colds Florida December. ""Slow testing down"" said. listened him, lost ability understand happening course virus. close one. Save gold, little buddy. Mild refers course illness doesn’t result hospitalization CoVID19, brutal one person know developed symptoms would say it’s big deal.

All missed work, although one feel fine 24 hours that’s one I’m stoked he’s family high confidence course illness. people dont think that's point~Fear literally screaming screen. Yup, thats totally mad. Yeah, this. Herd immunity magical threshold 60-70% people infected, virus spread anymore, effect point. gradual decrease transmission rates (R) % infected increases.

Thus, measures (such social distancing, masking, avoding mass events, etc) lowers effective herd immunity threshold (for R&lt;1). issue gradually roll back measures without many people get infected once. We're already seeing Europe. Yeah, I'm still little lost inferring from. commenter replied literally expressed concern sending (a teacher, themselves) kids school, knew kids kids. Nothing wrong Red Robin. saying even though burgers big delicious. lifting one one's mouth exercise.  **China:** semi-communistic nation shut whim, meaning virus outbreak huge deal 
**USA**: take freedom extreme fuck consequences, meaning virus outbreak last get vaccine fuck absolutely everything years

Why would bother trying stop point? China come stronger US weaker. weak US good China wants position new global superpower world US loses every year. I'd funding freaky animal viruses internally point. We've saying since Easter every single holiday yet seen marked jump cases here, steady increase. two statements mutually exclusive. actuality around 250k credibility....... FDA none hxq, plasma... everything we're learning think household spread proved huge unexpected problem - seems everyone becomes 'superspreader' 2 days, general distancing preventing spread population staying home guarantee household members' infection. multi-hour indoor exposure. families pseudo-isolate obviously dense/large households recirculating HVAC doomed. encouraging staying home heck even allowing interstate travel family (see: NYC exodus) traded workplace / school spread almost guaranteed household communication. Lmao made number one cares think. drug comments nothing me. Everyone something. Even mommy daddy. Nothing like good rail chill out. don’t meth. either you’d know difference. Glad wasn’t me. Good god, people get really dumb this. think makes unavoidable extensive data mining profiling done based spending history opting possibility bother you? mention inability make transactions glitch system anywhere remote connection problematic? Imagine able pay groceries debit card system down. eat shitty unhealthy way America poison fish stuff antibiotics. Overall they're healthier people know it? like graphs page: http://91-divoc.com/pages/covid-visualization/

The 4th graph shows numbers U.S. state, normalized population. No, catch itches like crazy. It’s hard discussion people want create definitions common terms. Piece shit humans ask me...  news number 6%.
May know math wrong getting downvoted? unhelpful community ""Those cannot learn history doomed repeat it."" Stoning women, killing gays... know Middle East. Americans like treat like city shining hill compared Israel (another ‘bastion human rights’). acting like tweaker, man. kinda kidding coke thing, think hit nail head honestly. Tüll arguing actively enough, even so, follow ups administering contact tracing extent laid Communicable Diseases Act.

Tegnell, usual, really bad explaining does. “Eat This, That!” doesn’t seem like good source COVID news Chin-Hong suggested inviting two three groups, single household, stay “pods,” least 6 feet apart participants. event outdoors, hand sanitizer readily available, either host wearing mask serve food, members pod could serve maintaining distance rest. Anybody using bathroom wear mask.

Absolutely one anything even close this. Neither young kids throwing house parties older ""adults"" throwing back yard get togethers. Yea, Vermont claiming they’ve got best country they’ve almost tested students *once* shows they’re watching going Urbana. Kinky  Perfect! That's talking about. wish articles gave sort information. Coronavirus going anywhere though. I’m trying find stats transmission rates someone asymptomatic. get downvoted, people fuckin twisted. 
Thanks response, makes sense. There's still enough cases right opened everything back normal levels, would spike right back up. me, control means everything open without much risk.

Country wide, still significantly cases first peak back april (though possible peak undercounted due testing shortages). Herd immunity threshold belived far lower 70% initially thought. think ""smart-ass"" states like NY, NJ, CA similar curves ""retards"" Arizona, Texas Florida? source. said “I bet” “I totally sure”.

Ofc couldn't. Unsubstantiated phrases, claims, etc. 


Why simple thing. Look excess death/mortality everyone else do, cdc, who, euromono, etc. see death now, compared peak 18/19 flu. 


But again, guess depends narrative. take two random numbers (as include factors like heart deceases name one), compare ""to prove"" point. Low quality, mis-information get. 


 
As said before: compare excess deaths get: (67664-59689) - (60640-51695)=7975-8945=-970

More deaths peak 18/19 flu. months reading in-depth analysis nation’s failures, bottom-line assessment new favorite think point new daily cases much higher originally started making restrictions make ton sense everybody acting like restrictions gone. go 
r/theydidthemath ask guys Exactly. everyone stay home easily, screwing parents. enjoy day sick kid. people... 5m cases US, 175k dead, need?
If everyone showed symptoms onset knew happening, wouldn’t issue. truly bizarre. Yeah, numbers Japan definitely underreported seen excess deaths, hospital bed demand surges, etc seen much rest world. understand point. seems like reasonable suggestion “not problem”. 

Everything life could possibly harm others restrictions regulations surrounding order keep others safe. 

Want drive? Acquire license. Don’t forget speed limit road rules. Want gun? Guess what, regulations rules. Want carry gun day long , that’s fine, rules regs you. 

I suppose support current defund police ideology right then, yeah? Also, I’ve never heard website, Eat This, source really want use COVID news? points contribute. Got it! namse like alexander aristotle ring bell? ghenghis khan well known preserving promoting smartest despite old traditions

Again, mistaking philosophers intellectual elites everyday schoolteachers.

Now also mistaking argument culture give shit everyday schoolteachers, strawman argument. seems like think I'm saying, ""schoolteachers important."" saying. Haha hehe haha ho time beds spare, exactly supposed put elderly people recovered? live nursing homes family care them, nursing homes outbreaks catching nurses anyway.

It’s horrible, still don’t know options Sorry, wrong. already achieved herd immunity certain parts country like NYC.  No, they're not.

This first store know sells them. outlet store gets clearance merchandise. put shelf. know sell friend mine saw employee wearing one asked got it. employee said behind counter, ask them. friend knew looking, told Who’s dadddddddyyyyyyy?

Me Trump! That’s who. Hahahahahha hahahahaha. 

You’re done bro. wanna complain f’n air. Old disabled people unable access many parts society it’s way forever. That’s way life is. It’s unfair. like it’s unfair quarantine healthy. classic case picking opinion makes feel good looking sources confirm want to.

I'm 110% sure thing. literally dismissed like 6 sources literally reason disagree person posted them. engage one single point made authors, doctors scientists quoted. 

You literally idea conclusions reached, perfectly reasonable proven may be, dismissed wave hand. 


I wish balls blatantly biased, project onto everyone disagrees me. That's amazing. guys *nuts.* mean, realize immediately downvote ban anyone *questions* cirlcle jerk, let alone brings sources citations counter bs. people ridiculed mocked anti-science.

Literally, whole entire sub cherry picked. literally conflicting opinions allowed. That's science. That's echo chamber. People responsible also got sick I'm saying right suggest cannot implemented. People tolerated much going lock everything again.

Then separate issue of; could made better use initial lockdown competent leaders would better now? answer yes. ship sailed. Well, probably wasn’t global pandemic happening yet. couldn’t see future  remember trying start car January Vermont oil frozen. Maybe keep thread that's bothering then. ran home daycare happened lot one moms. hating stay-at-home parents send children daycare least able care sick! Saudi Royal Family gangsters US supports protects them.

That need know US democracy. clean butthole letting go gotten lot shit, yeah, honestly. give sheet stats author picks exciting ones out. headline silly. florida supposed locked whole time? Florida done literally nothing different since reopening (besides closing bars again) cases dropping consistently. Yes huge spike July. positivity around 5% past several days. less 10% 2 weeks. literally we’ve done nothing different since re-opened May. subreddit ridiculous. Florida depends tourism shut since March we’d way worse right now. I’m glad governor hasn’t caved criticism. Wear mask live life. natural people read news figure relates that's point reading news.

No, main point reading *international news* find what's happening outside bubble country. course still try connect country, that's normal, what's normal spending time reading international news without actually interest learn what's happening why, use alternative jumping platform start talking country.

Hate break you, rest world fond type Americans ever able talk US, sadly Reddit full them. parents supposed do? symptoms COVID standard, anything cold, flu, allergies close enough force parent keep kids home 2 weeks *after symptoms subsided.* 

The light end tunnel getting kid tested, that's even good enough. see untenable position is? Saudi Arabia horrible. horrible. Fuck country. Middle East time someone something islamophobic say usually misconception stems shithole country. It’s really sad rest even close horrific country. However slavery absolutely prevalent entirety Middle East... hopefully level though. wrong, wait long enough low enough level point claimed at.

And saying willing put effort right protect vulnerable.

C'mon man. say wrong, explain actually right acknowledge it. statistic got most. Look many elderly died there. would people want protect moms/dads, grandpas/grandmas? 

The breakdown deaths across state:

0-4 age group: (0);
5-14 age group: (4);
15-24 age group: (27);
25-34 age group: (72);
35-44 age group: (208);
45-54 age group: (456);
55-64 age group: (1,178);
65-74 age group: (2,301);
75-84 age group: (3,179); and
85-plus age group: (3,532). I'd hope get financial support state. Mine pretty good small business loans right now, surprised me. residents area really great pick delivery help employees keep jobs businesses stay afloat. I'm sorry that's case at. 

If disgree state's decisions much, know moving easy, really make difference living state feel represents beliefs. Hopefully find place live least find peace at. I’m sure critically acclaimed source Idahoreporter similarly write article criticizing US live lobster crayfish markets. moment band played on. legit pulled old tattered book collection win argument Bill Rights Madison compiled presented original set, order remind people amendments presented order importance

I still feel validated Speech-to-text pretty awesome. Hardly effort all

And think that's page, must reading books kindergarteners  % deplorable little shits  arse, herd immunity years away, even antibodies stay, looks doubtful stage. ""I'm mad"" says, slamming page-long screed mad funny comment gets many upvotes deflecting blame someone else. China something bad ok USA Mexico similar worse? dont infrastructure PCR test seems like 6% death certificates list factors would suspicious ones. Though suppose died home autopsy done, fact COVID may thing known. Less supply + flood dollars created = inflation (higher prices) World, obviously. know say playing chess pigeon? tell live life. He’s really leaning whole “Gods doorstep” moniker little much don’t think? article trying say?
That coronavirus flu open everything again?
Genuinely curious received support need YEARS

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* masks saw gay faux masks nuanced opinions there, sure, mean headline straw man.

If walking behind guys shields proclaiming hoax, blaming Bill Gates 5G, advocating hydroxychloroquine (spelling? cares?), **while wearing mask yourself**, slightly nuanced opinion matter y*ou're siding idiotic scum western world*. entirely correct. measuring excess ia enough, show much excess offset e. g. lower flu deaths due social distancing, lockdowns etc. takes months, best cases perform studies. studies initiated, HCQ still widely regarded one promising drugs research groups world started studies, independently other. reason publish results. course are... Except average age death coronavirus US higher average life expectancy US. general outdoor activities seem lower-risk (not no-risk), yes. concern protest particular that, social media believed, many people believe virus exists all. even small number contracted (and probably small number) problem happens afterwards: demographic people going self-isolate avoid spreading germs people feel sick. 

Exponential growth means small number become much bigger quickly. states actually that, they're causing hollow arms race that's devaluing degrees. another instance teachers lining up, taking shot mouth, asking seconds. know think things get better people willing subject it. Gotta wonder folks see burnout rate think sounds like profession them. time, perhaps. think we're seeing beginning end leisure industry whole. next round lockdown come eventually, within lifetimes sure. saw kid post video sad teacher online class. Everybody cameras turned off. like teaching blank screen. Seriously? Kids required present? Lol damn sad. brought someone virus there, wonder many would willing stick claim purposely get infected put masks onto people hospital suffering Covid, die? Wow, fantastic. see medical degree wasted you. Smallpox, horrific 30% fatality rate thousands years worldwide, destroyed 1979. Good him. 99.98% people get covid survive anyway. people wear masks OC except beach outdoor restaurants.  people important enough shut economy then.may pay enough need strike. People suffer good public.  Don’t forget Sundance! mean kids get abused teachers constantly like prisoners, kids piss forced go bathroom, kids allowed drink anything, kids singled teachers malice want participate classes finally form power? woulda thunk. Masks indoors. OC lot outdoor space people generally hang around beach outdoor restaurants. Prob bit herd immunity play California. locked entire country guessing 1.5 billion people month , case count hundreds, including areas cases.i.e. went lockdown early hope disease would dissapear. longer economic staying power endure lockdown. Guess may forced act health system gets overwhelmed, expect smaller zones lockdown countrywide. international borders closed?

It's really practical close international borders. Someone New Zealand passport example cannot turned away want enter. 

But factors consider well. Shipping goods still needs continue ensure shortages break out. example rice, grown New Zealand needs brought daily. goods still transported involves truck drivers, cargo ships, planes arriving outside. sure biased since dealing young patients needed hospitalized? people either show symptoms recover silently.

I know someone flue affect eyesight permanently. wont go around saying ""The flue affect sight children, must shelter kids take risk. mean, everyone died got super sick vaccines, really benefit anyone relies working class taking vaccine work also precludes taking better vaccines come future? recently started calling conspiracy mythologists, feel like attributing mind power come new theories much compliment. Oh, Jesus... know myth teachers working multiple jobs comes overplayed anecdote. Stupidity american property sadly Jeez... problems USA. Health insurance tied employment... WOww.... WOW. glad left. sorry going separate US two parts?

The US obviously took title back Brazil. mean it’s prob like 7 million. Almost 850k dead

Approximately 7 million active cases now

How many people know right now?

Even troubling rise anti maskers, anti following advice science community. getting louder bold American trend. 

Countries also pressure reopen everything. could take 2 months see big consequences reopening soon meantime others think good reopen too.

I fear virus even started yet. That's true, official.guidance march wear mask. guidance changed, places democratic leaning constituencies (sf, nyc, seattle, ...) fairly high mask wearing compliance. Meanwhile Trump leaning places believe lies wear masks.

It insane. read too, I’m wondering well. 1% age 1.2bn+ people mah dude. guess flip side protests like likely spread virus within attending increase likelihood death. C'mon, 'Murica, can't let slide, something! AMERICA FIRST! D: /s ports closed? really.. think reason japan third population managed 10k deaths america 180k., draw corollary “ why?” I’ll wait...

Being American life see world leaders handle things.. cohesion respect law.. said, wait hear hypothesis..

It’s DEFINITELY cultural, immigrants japan respect culture nation... america anti immigrant it’s disgusting ( least right )... could go onto gun deaths , school shootings, crime citizens jailed behind bars...so please offer enlightenment think “ mindset” America’s citizens caused living Petrie dish virus proliferation... schools situated next different results certainly pulling different populations. There's reason title 1 schools exist - working difficult environments. increase teacher student ratio teachers bad students need achieve same.

Not sure private schools factor going private school going pretty predictable population is.

No teacher fix truancy, lack support system home, lack stability home, lack emphasis education, things plague schools. evidence? schools absorb disadvantaged neighborhoods go dump. automatically flight teachers usually ratings drop. opposite happens school absorbs wealthy neighborhood.

The students dictate teachers way around. I’m US. patient ventilator who’s son came back China. ran tests except covid (there testing January) remember night turning fought ventilator sputum hit eye. Antibody test confirmed it. didn’t need one know due fact nearly killed writings already wall. Going back school going work. like opening restaurants bars. get vaccine, can't congregate shape form. Social distancing masks allow anything beyond quarantine trips market. one wants face this. schools teachers put middle.  There's new way life coming collectively figure means survive crashed economy extended period time. pre vaccine period. Trying reopen schools distracting us real problem large parts workforce without income extended period time. thinking destructive society. seems looking like immunity 100% 0% varies good bit. Like Oxford vaccine people tested vaccine monkeys still got throat infections get serious illness. Also looking numbers Europe people still catching dying / getting hospitalized nearly much April suggesting many may partial immunity low exposures. I'd say fairly good student, lots A's high grades , high attendance etc. 100% certainty say would distance learning, would paid attention whatsoever. easy enough get distracted othrr things pay attention class. Online way way way worse. know would always like, computer, playing video games, things online class, I'm far one would this. fact, lots friends (including me) school computer classes alot time.

People vastly vastly overestimating interest say 14 year Olds school. given ability pay attention without getting called out, going fucking take it. People seem think teenagers care paying attention classes everything case Yeah, can't see ever finding decent job long employers find 2019 graduates. Legend? survived disease 1% death rate millions others survived well.

From comments seems people understand title, survive spanish flu, father did. Well one classes, class 28 students, group chat exactly 18 them. proclaimed failed. ended C doesn’t transfer college want take again. brought student court said claim isn’t supported take effect Covid crisis me, me. 

Essentially, professor gets excuse Covid, suck “should’ve able adjust”. 

That sounds like justice you? Eh it’s picking back Europe again. countries probably hold place, especially considering test developing countries. Obesity leading factor. mandating masks instead shutting fast food? keeping people homes fear instead telling getting outside exercising reduces risk?

Again, we’ve duped.. Lmao every teacher goes strike loses license. watch. watch state come crawling back schools actually reopen. Aa hope hit Freedom Information Act  Let’s hope leaks embarrassed administration enough either correct course resign mostly shitshow Knowing bit egypt, weren’t capable testing enough peaking, weren’t reporting lot known cases. it’s getting downvoted it’s misleading. someone already hypertension and/or obese, would comorbidity. That's true. grandma used say ""you wanna flush toilet? fine me!""

We went cremation though. Unfortunately, physical releases (especially Blu-ray) expensive, labels already skipping altogether release content streaming only. we'll see whether even get choice. likely won’t reinfected within 6 months isn’t guarantee. 

The unfortunate thing immune system it’s unique person. Something made one person severely ill may make another person mildly ill. Likewise antibodies could prove fight infection, could not. antibodies could fade B cell response could help create antibodies fight new infection may not. 

What know reinfection within 6 months happens, it’ll likely smaller subset people people infected able fight 2nd illness immune systems challenged. thats anything works. 6% completely healthy people dropped dead covid. covid main cause others, simlly contributing simultaneous factors.

respiratory failure considered comorbidity charts. This. would unpopular, state lock borders open numbers drop defined thresholds.  lockdown shut thousands businesses long single case. worth prevent death smart folks Alabama. institution higher learning less. Coronavirus found processed meat another country. believe found some
Imported chicken another country. know cases going LA, fuck still lot! Many, yes. Entire? No. headline makes seem like another mutation occurred however strain Europe prevalent wide spread. another doom gloom article. Now, back March lot people didn’t think even gonna big deal US TLDR $$$$$$$$$$$$ Medicaid?

I'm unemployed health insurance. pay literally $0 month would taken care cost needed medical care. Blu-ray, perhaps. Streamed, much.

Sure. That's going personal preference, want look best, obviously go shitty quality cinemas still operational then.

See response I'm wondering that's end it. Brazil, US, Europe etc peaked I'm sure large countries left go India. Indonesia still seems uptrend. Globally looks like things may peaked mid August. Hopefully. Nothing see folks! Back school now!

-Governor Rona DeathSentence like person, though, right?

What changed? think flying perfectly possible, carries medium kind risk properly managed. Certainly lower risk visiting Florida... Prediction: link eventually comes Russian intelligence anti-covid protests. Yeah, people choosing normal life isolation 4 months “2 weeks flatten curve”. Lol people getting humor here. snickered (; teacher grade level one taking FMLA sub spot. admin sucks they're supporting way. threw students walked away.

I work particularly bad school terms leadership. union reps putting together huge meeting together many issues. ....what? I've never considered that. suppose that's pretty egocentric. mean...this best right now, though. better paying jobs area right -- pay high classroom teachers outrageously competitive. RTI math position open last year. 600 applicants. 55 interviewees (I one). 3 finalists (I not). *could* get little money classroom teacher private school. 3 years ago made $32,500 Master's degree. fucking awful.

So really know here. Even George Orwell would scared WA resident, completely agree. surreal watching states like Texas Arizona crazy high death rates. Meanwhile, ground zero even top 40 cases per capita top 30 deaths per capita. patient zero DAY S. Korea, really anyone follow. top that, Trump HATES Inslee really made things difficult possible him. I'm really proud state Gov Inslee done great job, especially hand dealt. I’m sure. There’s something completely unnatural what’s taking place Facebook. 

It’s easy people wrong intentions create something looks authentic spread it. 

I don’t know why. Part believes older people (the stereotypical “boomer”) sort mystical fascination internet. None could fix issue computer set router. 

What see shared Facebook often comes family friends adds level authenticity regardless origin. don’t realize meme shared created Russian troll farm.  

I guess bring good point serious moral question. believe free speech access information even detriment society. Yikes... it’s late considering this. unclear count obesity.

I'd shocked count comorbidity...? rest billion people you.

Gonna fun flight. Yeah can’t peddle indoctrinate leftist propaganda mom dad within earshot ... hope drivers enjoyed getting yelled time drove military base night. Also can’t use school’s software. many districts states, mandated use particular Learning Management System. 

Think classrooms teacher said, “no don’t like room, I’m going hold class basement” would never fly. It’s like school tools use. always lot people coming Nicaragua ilegally. Nicaragua anything control spread virus (not even testing, lot unknown pneumonia deaths reported). So, add 2 together get what's happening.


We tried close border threatened us blockade truck coming here. Nothing could do. ""As long me"" 

""OMG got COVID! Somebody help me!"" Literally. keep saying wife...”is don’t realize?” “Should go eat?” (Haven’t since March). I’m like “no way!”. It’s like I’m gaslighting Worldometer thinks closer 190k Unfortunately huge majority people aren’t healthy one reddit talking CDC revised Coronavirus deaths statistics, turns 9% previously recorded deaths actually COVID?

Seems like MAJOR news.

But *nowhere.* Confidential? Man, that's weird way spell embarrassing. teach 7th grade, working classroom optional idiot admin office dumb mask may start working 100% home. AMC pay employees enough go around removing people. I'd sure hell removing people $11/hour. manager it, he'd day.

Alamo Drafthouse gets away AMC standard movie theater attracts lowest common denominator. AMC started removing people, they'd removing hell lot draft house did. I’m teacher also part summer training help teachers learn basics remote teaching tell 20% teachers low tech turning camera going hard them. examples...

I screensharing teacher show paste link thought me. tried teaching screen share confused. 

Another teacher didn’t know attach PDF. didn’t understand files organized computer go folder figure organized. 

Teaching online operating camera learning download homework. really art teaching online even though 20% teachers campus low tech, I’d say 80% prepared teach effective pedagogical skills day 1. 

It’s fault though - takes months even years teach online effectively. year wash. I’m upset could dealt better. issue like me....


I elainarosalina@gmail.com wife work call woman claimed election “depending wins, coronavirus disappear.” idea spices effect.

Pretty neat. Thanks sharing that! know reinfection 1 million? [And thought supposed funny pace we're moving, going take far less 500 years. Shit, Kanye runs president next 20 years, less equivalent President Dwayne Elizondo Mountain Dew Herbert Camacho. Capitalism downside would wasting massive amounts time, money resources producing, distributing administering something yet proven prevent COVID-19, also known Phase III clinical trials. turns provide meaningful immunity, drain could allocated one candidates may prove viable. 

Maybe worst though, rushed, bust vaccine millions get injected nothing would cause irreparable level distrust governments fear science. would catastrophic could render working vaccine later date useless, people would refuse due aforementioned distrust fear. Yeah. headline sounds like incognito push person classes.

Granted... good position attempt least hybrid models. Hopefully works out. Identify refuse treat get infected complete lockdown testing? never said India nothing start, said testing capacity high several months ago. already accomplished hacking disinformation before, during, 2016 election.   book linked today Reddit. wiki: book emphasizes Russia must spread anti-Americanism everywhere: ""the main 'scapegoat' precisely U.S.""

Elainarosalina@gmail.com time without air travel North, Central South Americas might gone completely untouched. That's wild think sure downvoted, legitimate possibilities. However, would add lack widespread testing really leaves us dark going there. lie, could slap button right make kind people vanish Earth, I'd it. remaining people might hate vilify I'll always know Earth solid. Anything like propaganda. Typical America mindset. Certainly desire go theater buY someone living Northern California we’ve decent heat wave last weeks many homes don’t ac can’t really leave windows open thanks wildfires, understand people would think it. 

Not saying it’s right call seeing people wander around Home Depot something, I’m surprised. see watched premise *Idiocracy*. thought talking Obama confused. coworker went vacation, got COVID, sick week half (had trouble breathing, bedridden, etc).

When got back complained nobody else household symptoms quarantine wearing masks stupid. Haha start distance learning next week! Wish luck! *feeling 1914 Parisian marching war* They’d go back hating Irish Italians. Somebody, minds, bottom socio-economic pyramid. Funny quickly forget. teacher working seven hours day? Seriously, teach? mom taught elementary. kids 7-8 hours day. teachers kids, kids go home. mom worked many evenings, well many Sunday afternoons. in, probably put 50 hours week, making overtime. mostly correct, herd immunity come natural infection too, vaccination Look Europe? We’ve done shitty job they’re beginning spike too. wanna point out. come China control fruit labor? send scientisits? use science facility? earth way stay undetected martian sensors. It’s terrifying quickly easily thing spreads. hope global community overcome this, I’m feeling lot depression it. Exponential growth enters chat. See advocate herd immunity, remember exponential grows really fast. Like population India 4x usa, still doubling rate still 30 days, means two months. Happy cake day 🥺💜 best teacher's kid know spell losing. Ouch. I’m sorry people don’t understand that. Don’t blame teachers, don’t want this. think people least know it’s teachers fault here.  don’t blame all. 

It used teachers supposed educate kids. 

Then expected become human shields event active shooter.

Now they’re asked risk infection death SOME* people tired parenting crotch goblins.


(* = include parents choice go back work childcare alternative, children receiving special services districts) greek row, campus kids throwing parties. narrative kids greek life causing spike uninformed one. gunning herd immunity guess. much ""academic freedom."" Ok, explain 5,000 intentional unintentional injury/poisoning. find hard believe entire classes failed. Yes, 180,000 people already dead USA alone this, worse normal mass murderers break 100 kills.

It's shooting sick people, shooting criminals purposely trying spread lethal infectious disease kills millions people worldwide injured tens millions. Swedes already pay one highest tax rates world. Giving Swedish governmebt money like giving alcohol alcoholic. Maybe focus actually money way forward. evidence supports theory get infected multiple times immunity may permanent. careful assume get infected again! 65 kids middle school spanish class had.

one super nice teacher open period would take kids routine troublemakers room but, one period kids leave, poor senora left trying manage literally 5 dozen us little assholes own, one shitty ""portable"" classrooms ac.

turned nice teacher god damn diddler arizona schools almost utter shitshows Median age 15.9, Average age 24.8, helps lot Covid-19.

&amp;#x200B;

 5,000 intentional unintentional injury/ poisoning. counted Covid deaths? Second wave start first one never ends. Big brain time. Well, learning hard lesson within week two think that's correct assertion. Immune system antibodies memory cells, immune system far far complex thing, expect atleast bit stronger India. Also, sanitation shit years now, people die diseases, natural selection also would mean stronger immunity. 

However, even assume immune system fight back unseen pathogens, multiple reports cross reactivity antibodies. expect significant exposure coronavirus India, lack hygiene assumptions here. I'm rural Idaho. mask mandate. cases county, we're rural, we're behind curve larger cities seen probably social distanced early. knew everyone thought totally similar me, still thought caring (very religious area). Turns aren't. worst feeling is, think mostly everyone uncaring. moved work pandemic really shown state me. lockdowns Denmark still invasive, everything non essential closed two three months.

Sure yielded good results, sure really afford another one spread picks again. Try telling conspiracy idiots. think everywhere state giving choice distance learning. Anyone subjected schools subjected parents. parents can't afford home, also can't afford school closed. Seems ""come want, stay home choose"" model best possible option. People magically stop getting sick stop testing. Rates change like everyone around wore mask vs. Everyone around wearing mask? Bald dude behind right shoulder looking Becky like ""I legit heard cough breath...remove yourself"". Please show Trump, he'll want one. won't.  sky blue. think every major city Florida mask requirement now, person school started concerned. Elongated Muskrat considers allies. completely false *tips bowler hat* Yay Easy prove:

1- can't go jail car accident, unless drunk something, that's different story. Actually Saudi Arabia, different entity beside cops handle car accidents, authority take jail anything. estimate accident, prove wrong (if camera good go), otherwise would rely type accident installed cameras near by.

2- actually received racist comments, could raised law suit (he capture camera) would win easily, Saudi Arabia applied strict laws regarding that, click application report anything sort.

3- Saudi Arabian people known nice foreigners, coming people know visited country before. one incident two, mean country sucks people racist.

I'm still sure seeing - I'm arguing cases per day falling, definitely been. even charts linked to, apparent testing numbers per day also falling time period.

I mean, maybe take position they're testing less fewer people getting sick? could be, suppose. Hospitalizations definitely falling, legitimately cheerful. No, 2 common things table, apparently still read yet, influenza/pneumonia (which combined together reason) respiratory failure. theory conventional one:

have yet experienced symptoms effective spreading COVID.

One study yet published suffer small sample size.

[One Based posting, realize probably asking presymptomatic spread. It’s common Lmfao, 300,000 excess deaths compared 2019. anything, Covid deaths underreported. especially true since coordinated effort states keep case counts deaths public, i.e., Florida, Georgia, others. also completely transparent attempt try divert CDC data another agency.

Again, trying paint rosier picture, clear are, one denial, me. along idiot doctors politicians, still plenty run mill 844K deaths...but means afriad. definitely depends state. teach Massachusetts union great standing us past eight months. BOX SALT 🧂 suprised? i'm definitly not... It’s subject. 😂 844K deaths.

That something people wanting wear mask take serious. First half 2021 sounds good cycle happened SARS many infected per 100 tests? many critical cases hospital? Actually checking arguments internet instead hypothesizing? Get here.

(No seriously it’s good hypothesis) Hah! love this. BA sciences known better Also bad breath, wouldn’t like wear mask all. Isn’t herd immunity though? It’s getting slightly better last couple weeks.

You see herd immunity posts weeks ago! Downvote bonanza. Cant wait someone step something them! minute now! bro HOW!!! FUCK

Edit: read article, OP people like give anxiety everytime open reddit He's talking general authorization. also said could EUA October. got curve way down. google 'covid counts' get nice utility pick state etc see We've seen convalescent plasma FDA compromised Trump's corruption malfeasance.

It **has** political. **will** political. Trump willing sacrifice number American lives process. understanding lumber shortage already existed Covid. derecho tore Midwest certainly help that. can't even guess many pole barns need rebuilt let alone homes businesses. Going tough spring probably. extremely misleading title. Almost like publishing article called “Hitler Dead, Nazis Defeated!” 1983. thats irrelevant. nowhere near 70% reason slowed people avoiding large congregations strangers, wearing masks, staying home often, etc.

If everything opened allow herd immunity reached absolute number deaths would utterly dwarf anything we've seen far. attempted government strategy.  Everyone dies heart failure. Yea still sign K12 kids? 40% deaths nationally nursing homes. total abdication responsibility public/private sides protect vulnerable, much outrage shaming directed elsewhere. 

It seems like metric considered 5% positivity rate testing. Though requires contract tracing restrictions implemented scale percentage help minimize exponential spread. really gotten point test US yet countries moved phase handling it. called heard immunity. reason every area spikes gets better. work university penn, spiked it. even really patients hospital Wearing mask pandemic good helps curb spread virus.

I'm sure happened heard it. people arguing followed Sweden's lead (which public health leaders saying major shortcomings), read original comment line. Anyone thinks Americans would voluntarily follow suggestions wear masks socially distance paying attention. Yes, see total compliance Sweden, even mandates place U.S. compliance depressingly abysmal, know anyone would think lifting would entice people voluntarily follow recommendations. Instead protests masks events folks publicly defy mandates protest, people wear masks gather together create outbreaks. U.S. individualistic full people think know better experts voluntary measures actually followed.

First off, lot secondary conditions caused bodies immune response COVID, like respiratory failure. Middle aged adults randomly get respiratory failure nowhere.

Second, notice lot secondary conditions deadly. Obesity? Extremely unhealthy again, people randomly die it. There's millions Americans living heart conditions die.

Finally look excess deaths year get good indicator many people died COVID. There's around 200k excess deaths, meaning 200k normal year adjusted population size, people dying conditions regardless 200k excess deaths.

Btw, better curriculum better outcomes require lot time money, willing pay supplies training ur pocket? going increase tax burden ur surrounding area?

Looking forward answers :) TLDR: 9 new imported cases, 0 new domestic case, 4 new imported asymptomatic carriers, 0 new domestic asymptomatic carrier

Getting rid sick old people state? tried. Combed district plans. Went meetings including 3 hour school board meetings. Bought masks match outfits. Went school week school prep (we haven’t started yet). bounce. They’ve got million rules place kids “grown ups” following them, including mask wearing mandated live. Next level denial. I’m worth coworkers putting in. Man, rally school team spirit game, fuck team player pandemic. thanks. Preach Exactly: ""How long process usually take?"" -- ""Oh, 5-10 years usually""... ""How long working vaccine"" -- ""Oh 5-10 months""...

SHIP IT! Perhaps Governor DeathSentence focus trying halt spread COVID-19 wanting large number visitors come state.

Just saying. sure could ask blueprint adapt situation.

The Prime Minister Pakistan literally went way [**offered** India country's success, despite tensions all-time high two countries. 

In response, India [declined offer fact made childish I'm teaching Face Face day far better digital teaching standpoint. fellow teachers breaking daily tears, sometimes class even started. one team teaching 50+ kids day digitally ESE class subjects. barely hanging on.

The safety aspect sucks. I'm somewhat peace there... I'm young, wife teaches school, kids plan kids. also think already it, we're super worried exposed.

We wear masks constantly about, admin joke. principal school started back ""cries"" scared year, twenty minutes later talks cannot trust news. think I've seen wear mask handful times. walks around holding kids hands (elementary) gives hugs. ridiculous. makes near impossible convince children serious.

 EDIT: I'd like add view important service families need send children school necessity cannot stay home work time. teachers risks worries digital. need digital mind kids need person, even think that, health-wise, would better everything digital.  overcome stigma worst beer world though? I've back work teacher one month - remote teaching. I've ready quit least 3 times lost 800.00 month pay. extremely stressful I've worked 80 90 hours week trying figure various programs get kids engaged. I'm exhausted hungry time. 

The tasks attendance, webpage updates (which mandatory brand new), creation digital lesson plans, learning manage 60 70 kids ZOOM per class everyday bamboozled. worth it. know do. 

And want catch Covid -- sigh. took month day Diamond Princess set sail first death. Cheaper infect too! post removed cannot verify reliable source. Twitter sources may reliable. possible, please re-submit link reliable source (i.e. news article).

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Let rephrase truthy:

Governor Ron DeSantis looks state tax revenue; panics begs tourists visit right away Whatever friend. great night!  bet does, fuckwit testing Pakistan much worse off. may case reached herd immunity already.

If case, Pakistan's death toll would roof. 

As right now, opposite: Pakistan's death rate PER MILLION almost half compared India's death rate per million. 

Dismissing ""reached herd immunity"" quite possibly braindead take. might surprise you, Chinese government gauges Chinese public opinion attentively carefully, US government money, corporate interest, populism, party politics taken roots. Every decision Chinese government makes overwhelming support mainland Chinese people. Story sounds familiar! age would also really hard time leaving job I’m now. don’t get teach subjects would like would love find something suited interests style. people work best people I’ve ever met. Incredibly talented friendly people. job painful days rewarding. would feel guilty leaving. 

That said family comes first. find something that’s higher paying, good benefits, better suited teaching style would leave second. 

You’re good spot might someday health changes get older want retire. know someone worked self employed whole life physically demanding job. Made good money retirement paid insurance themselves. he’s getting age body absolutely shot. multiple major health issues can’t retire never retirement plan. (He’s quite literally walking COVID time bomb.) Point it’s good look future plan ahead. organized kens Karen’s That's it. whole thing tied election. I'm sure big brains vaccine development living best, can't change time, required proper validation. trust first vaccine door, supported US government, primarily shit show poorly whole dilemma managed, become voting point actual proper tested vetted vaccine. EU / UK / Japan give proper approval well, I'll stick arm. history repeat itself. sad say this. so? people would still need quarantine viral load ramping up, unless keep retesting determine plateau, no? *WHAT* Young population also. And, experience (in local union leadership educator), unless collective bargaining, generally see union support group individuals loudly press significant political play made. Individual union employee rights likely acted cause less ripple effect big newsmakers. 10,000 idiot morons*
 
There. Fixed Ironically another conspiracy theory Florida outbreak clearly winding down. Wonder mask social distancing improved something like herd immunity happened. known case density among highest world, would make sense. Arizona, question. Less Murdoch media. likely fomented social media. coordination this. Oh, imbecile conspiracy theorist. Thanks clearing up, stupid. Worst case. People believe hoax never stopped it. Oh yeah. Credit card companies would call relentlessly son died. adult (age 25). One asshole asked assets car. said died car wreck car totaled. angry even audacity ask that!
I spoke attorney advised responsible adult son's credit card debt.  Problem is, states don’t really collective bargaining unions toothless. negotiation lot states. crook arm stop many particles all! Use mask like tissue able get front nose mouth time already there, take replace it! Carry extra masks you! recommended carry extra masks swap whenever get sweaty uncomfortable anyway! get home, washing four masks amount work time washing one mask. 44.64 deaths per 100k population

To put perspective, ranking common causes death:

1. Heart disease - 163.6 per 100k
2. Cancer - 149.1 per 100k
3. Accidents (all types) - 52.2 per 100k
4. Chronic lower respiratory diseases - 39.7 per 100k

Which means areas USA COVID-19 fourth leading cause death. like Jedi mind trick. way OP word it, made sound like person. Yeah, lack density definitely helps. Even sufu there’s many people compared city. 

Idk also something majority state healthier average. Yes, Rez drags averages lot, farm communities way healthier average America. 

Cause despite positive rates aren’t seeing huge spike hospitalization states are. see hospitals packed, aren’t. don’t wanna jinx it, majority deaths nursing homes.  What's reason today's discontinuous-looking spike case counts several midwest states (IA, SD, ND)? change reporting Maybe talk demon sperm intravenous disinfectants something loss faith. 😉 drove Duval St Key West people shoulder shoulder sidewalk. Mostly wearing masks police code officers enforcement. 

We need encourage people find Florida. winter going insane here, tropical destinations closed Americans onerous quarantine measures options warm weather vacation limited. Hi Norristown! Sure, absent factor, whatever restrictions Sweden right combined existing seroprevalence clearly enough keep r 0

Definitely saying restrictions won’t needed long time, Sweden acceptable. sure. third testing per capita India. I'll buy one. Hopefully they'll available public. I'm afraid hospitals buy up. headline straw man. 10,000 people gather different disagreements lockdown 10,000 gather claim coronavirus ‘a hoax.’ Right. Sensationalism like disingenuous. Could please quote part said “do nothing”?

People weird idea can’t criticize things unless entirely. It’s huge problem society, feel like defend things 100% it’s side. ever think others yourself? People want, lot easier find purpose sacrifice service ambition hedonism. luckily find hoax weeks drink pee whilst reading fear mongering propaganda Interestingly, single hospitalization. Yet, rate. claim cases came classrooms, too. social events like. Bah, it'd boon even played politics. lot times School Boards filled people higher ambitions barely vote record use them.

The cops serve secondary purpose put ""nice"" face police children. officer regular eats children. Another sad reality cop campus nice parents get rather hand times. also deal lot child abuse, cop right handle part reporting process boon.

It sucks, they're protection crazy people. thought types america lol caught shingles around age 30, left facial scars caused nerve pain quite time. said - worse catch shingles retirement years. guess like initial chickenpox, access vaccination, better shingles sooner later. I’d happy work county decide **our** expensive taxes providing kids lieu traditional schools year, appears public school teachers going sit (without pay). 

So yeah, could blessing disguise - finally catalyst change, it’s apparent lot schools aren’t providing good value taxpayers, based much funding need vs educational outcomes. Teachers dont 3 months off, 10 month contract , payment spread 12 months. Teachers work overtime. dont get paid Curriculum building, lesson plans, training. unpaid, hours. 
Try becoming teacher! hear many open positions right 🙃 truth unions support cave really upsetting. Politicians run unions, strike, cry foul, disrupt ""expected"" teaching field way, politicians supporting union upset, union leadership cave political demands. Idiocracy among us! 

We live aftermath anti-science anti-intellectualism world dumb proud norm! reason they're requiring medical professionals administer tests want sure positive results get reported health departments. sucks it’s still something like 28th total cases per capita state. There’s lot people CA. Yup.

And spike media talking covid enough.

And school outbreaks community transmission outside schools.

And cases weren’t big deal deaths down, deaths wasn’t big deal old deaths thought deaths down.

It’s fucked.

But hospitalizations bit now, there’s that. Tfw Mexico manage put together elementary education easily accessible television every kid watch US sitting around thumbs assess claiming nothing done real complicated issue great answers. huge component contacts well.. friends classmates become leads jobs support later entering work place.

Several jobs leads friends thier network looking fill role. lying think country Covid control. resurgence proves control. Testing capacity.  Yea, well, goes whole rabbit hole. Basically 2 generations, starting 3 row absolutely decimated economically, even generation money power historically low savings much spending power concentrated increasingly smaller smaller group, yea, nothing done, we're gonna lose things like this. It‘s tricky situation. pandemic, harmful is, going wipe humanity, next one might. definite need accelerated processes. hand, authoritarian politicians try ways: release early vaccine prove greatness strengthen anti-vaxxers time. never locked in. Eating Red Robin count exercise. Good luck, Costa Rica! 🍀🤞🙏🤞🍀 Take one down, pass around Germany made arrests gatherings. fecked country. Weak water government organise dyslexic gangbang warehouse Sweet home Alabama Awesome, love gator grill. delicious. jobs going get? Working instacart? grocery store workers work, teachers can. Education, especially young, essential. Isolate vulnerable teachers otherwise get back work. Sweden NEVER shut schools fine. Yeah protests much bigger reports loads arrests, yet Reddit seems care highlighting stupid thing small minority Brits do. wonder why. wife teacher currently fucking classroom, already one COVID scare worried shitless another.

So please presume preach life death is. also dealing stuff long teaching, never saw tons folks Reddit suddenly hyper-concerned safety lack support before. claiming know stuff yet read papers regarding estimated IFRs? Every developed nation estimated IFR. Like said go unless think Western governments hiding deaths.

&amp;#x200B;

But here's pre-print conducted say, 'they peer-reviewed', based recent statistics.

If anything, basing antibody data going give higher IFR everyone produces antibodies become undetectable time.

As criticising comparing flu, typical thing people using respiratory virus (like flu) order make assumptions transmission prevention. Silly people think saying 'it's flu'. best tell scientists work assumption virus spread like flu (and respiratory viruses). data supporting use face masks come analysing flu spreads. scientists taken seriously? Come hospital. meds treat mental illness. Yup, lot's people seem significantly overestimating amount interest focus children actually paying attention class. like university students voluntarily often understand strong incentive actually pay attention. absolutely idea talking about. must blast parties It’s tragic we’re losing professionals Im also Mind cant operate computer day age teacher anymore. old teachers quitting saw article one teacher saying stress streamed day overwhelming Thats completely fair sign that. Feeling frustrated bc you’re incompetent utilize tools job different scenario entirely. But, but, he's wearing white coat! think they’re saying BBC said it, children don’t spread it? certain interpretation text never read original language correct one? way read he's saying expecting 20% far 25% would see time period normal year. would spin sentence explicitly stating there's fewer claims normal year? 

*""Even though number claims car come SOS International fewer last year, still expected.""*

It's really ambiguous. know. teacher wife wakes up, I'll ask I'd blame her. disinfect drinking water 36W UV LED lamp (I get drinking water well E. Coli years ago. water goes \~2"" / 6cm, 4ft/\~1.30m pipe glass tube inside contains lamp. kill 99.9% bacteria viruses 2.5m³/h. also make blind almost instantly causes extreme radiation damage skin. UVC lamps great tool, nothing carry around portable device.  shocker. share photo it? solid white mask kind looks like adult diaper worn? I’m 22. Basically alone time now, desiring social interaction worried ramifications expanding social circle. Many peers feel way course not. would he? People fat..not morbidly obese like US Lol: sounds like citizens punished breaking public health edicts ***during deadly pandemic***. 🙄

Korea’s one college kid ***in jail months still awaiting trial*** ommitting two contacts spoke contact tracers. disgusting person.

A mistake ignorance disgusting person make.

You say things like probably think kind. think run country based data one day.

And also think looking cheap budget solutions corona.

Anyway, continuously adapt corona policies. start big huge policy thay know works, see afterwards get impact less intrusive means. goes national lockdowns small local semi-lockdowns.

But gamble like many countries do. 

It's possible change testing policy sometime, week starts looking like possibility. Except exercises Click bait — “G” aka Lombardy strain/clade one hit China couple months ago, Vietnam East Asian countries. Bummer. Somebody something that. XD inability education system properly adapt crisis proves incapable education system first place. first part true. said he'd shaking hands hospital thought covid patients. actually interesting watch say - he's putting context saying scientific advice shaking hands problem long hands washed properly (I'm agreeing - pointing saying). sounds lot like climate change issue. You’d believe science believe it. 

I raised home believe science religion. parents bought books teen “prove” dinosaurs didn’t exist carbon-14 dating lie. several topics like we’re “discredited” using Bible reference point. It’s maddening. Funny CAPITALISM RACISM far worst socialist countries ideologies. ( face palm)

let guess, one people understand (or pretends understand) socialism call countries like sweden socialist? they're not, never been, objectively - leaves actual socialist countries like china russia 60s, go ahead draw comparisons, i'd love see argument :p economy supermarkets food? Education indoctrination. local medical school regularly advertises ""service"" newspaper. claim finished cremate remains ""dignified scattering sea"". greater faith humanity me. stupid scared animals howling wind. Always been. Still reeling huge rises cases saw BLM protests 😴 Ha.. mean isnt one fears americans country turn “ communist “ “ leftist socialist”. “ food lines “ , “ violence “ ““ unemploYment “ “despair” ? Funny CAPITALISM RACISM far worst socialist countries ideologies.   ( face palm) time break tradition

Could agree more. Funerals damn depressing...for lack better word. loved one cremated (this assumes we're middle pandemic) take ashes wild night town epic trip celebrate life loved ones. 

I think 100 ways honor family friends far better sitting stuffy funeral parlor church wearing uncomfortable clothes wondering mascara running. 

For funerals definitely fall category we've certain way long we've forgotten why. listed worldometer. must error though updated correct number.

That makes sense. Even though large variability daily numbers, randomly quadruple nowhere. 3 shows types health conditions contributing causes mentioned conjunction deaths involving coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). **For 6% deaths, COVID-19 cause mentioned**. deaths conditions causes **in addition to** COVID-19, average, 2.6 additional conditions causes per death. 6% 153,504 deaths recorded actually died Covid.

That's 9,210 deaths.

**The 94% 2-3 serious illnesses &amp; overwhelming majority of** _**""very advanced age"".**_ void mass exodus creates expected filled substitute teachers. Well, SURPRISE, poor souls completely untrained new style teaching expected work $75-$125/day. sister subbing several years says list long-term gigs unbelievable. $85/day + online teaching training + risk Covid person means staying FAR away long financially so. Good luck future. I’m sorry happened. True that. frankly disgusting. morons tried jailed immediately. Since happening, get drug street person gets 1 little slap-a-roni missed point I'm taking day celebrating.

Careful now. election security systematically dismantled, GOP openly asked foreign aid rig elections. 

You might witness death nation. also culture prsenteeism US. Ever since early childhood we're basically told, matter shit feel, take pill, suck get back work.

Now, sudden we're told exact opposite, habits lifetime hard break. need reply. Thank writing thorough comment address. Preachhhhh whats problem. remote learning tools bad?, teachers old learn new tricks? problem? source this? Fox News pushes homeschooling? curious there’s validity claim Almost every single Covid denier gets sick says “I wish took serious.""

To anyone reply: ""Tough luck."" 

Actively harming everyone around want live delusion. I’ve taught online full time eight years. world schema selfishness. disease overexposing fact still people thinking individuals, part whole society. hope best: we’ll get pandemia stronger, unified. think confusing remsividir-like compound Gilead also effective FIP refused submit authorization side effects animals may harm remsividir authorization process Ebola, get black market.

This one another company, Anivive, different number acts different part virus. Brooooooo!!!!!! Wayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy Lol work hallway? Well done quitting: exploitation workers higher education sector scandal. We’re last, meaning we’re first Yep, whole world banded together messing US. That's likely infectious virus... never get vaccine? long prepared live like this? We're seeing 2nd major wave Morocco, lockdown like 100ish cases per day, unfortunately like 2 weeks now, constantly 1k+ cases situation looking dire. started 7th. 22 days since 400,000 people started gathering 8/16 would already started see people dropping dead. Covid hang dormant whatever event starts manifesting.  
the comment ""Harleys sale"" ignorant stupid huge reason people tired wolf crying. last name makes wince bit every time read hear it. sure why. could possibly predict this????   good news? like old news nothing changed right Won’t anyone think accountants Trying funny, many crusty ass oldies can’t figure use Zoom video apps blaming Covid? Franklin basically sums It’s like we’re given good choices. elections. It’s like game rigged make sure republican wins. really understand comming from.
The thing is, know yet. Long term effects still studied.

Also, ""healthy"" people keep living (as ignoring precautions) way risk ""careful"". barely get FB, Twitter Instagram. far FB worse. mutual acquaintance send video Chinese got virus control drinking hottest water would burn esophagus! made virus disappear. Yup blocked her! 🙄🙄🙄 know.

THIRD BASE Comfortable pensions? Seriously? pension allow still pull Social Security low. Dad used think like you. shocked told pay include holidays, Winter Break, Spring Break, Summer anything beyond 8-4 work day unpaid---except coaching. got $1000/ year thing coached. worked $8/ hour. made babysitter 1990s. wonder large uptick London metro coming weeks.

No sympathy morons, fear families coworkers Lol don’t know you’re allowed say anything positive sub Florida? getting worse uh, people Reddit think so! know, people aren’t gunna like recently couple evil people arrested absolute terrible things kids. One killed jail cell. awaiting trial. think general population understand terrible people horrible kids.

Now many people favor sending children dangerous situation could turn kids disease carrying time bombs. get it, won’t, everlasting health complications selfishness parents around willing put children risk. What’s even scary kids pass loved ones. Sure survive won’t. like kids, everlasting health complications getting sick.

It’s hard understand one worse other. understand different. different doesn’t make either one less worse, least, me. Seems odd many people want justice one atrocity ignoring another. hate kids. Excellent ideas!!! 100% masks go anywhere people north Oc. Beach different story. must charts they’re hiding numbers. welding thing Wuhan though Can't email exams? school districts gonna pay phone bill? summers they're paid.  teachers resigning often loose license certification pension, unions apparently busy turning fucking crickets.

In meantime police officers murdering people streets getting fired, can't loose pension unions defend literally matter what.

Is country ever going figure could save money policing invested education ?

How painfully obvious things get wake fuck ?! Interesting parents first play major role helping educate kids home April singing teachers’ praises, saying deserve raises, calling heroes idea difficult teach children...fast forward September they’re yelling teachers suck up, stop complaining, get back work. countries seem problem mass protests force deeply unpopular political leaders resign. Americans willing same? One plausible explanation Desantis really unpopular media makes be. dunno got voted. Gator delicious, truth spoken here. zoom, everyone hear scream. Lol. videos Chinese government made. funny. nUmBeRs gOiNg DoWn!!! China That’s ratio seeing well wealthy suburb Dallas. 3/4 home, 1/4 class. Teaching home easy hell heard teachers school it’s happiest workplace upgrade happen them. Teachers said get actually teach instead moderate behaviors rambunctious kids mute kids won’t shut class mates mute aswell. teachers complain ones hate wife’s husbands That's cops Covid-19 also plans attending mad people waking up? 

 teacher. sucked long time, one noticed. people finally realizing bad is, I'm going argue. possible get rid trump I'm Egyptian, government useless completely untrustworthy comes Coronavirus data, Saudi Arabia literally right next door currently 300k cases, there's way touristic, vastly populated, densely urbanized neighbor 100k cases. Nope. ok performance.

So mass protests calling immediate resignation? normal course action remove deeply unpopular political leader, instead waiting years next election? Article says contagious less lethal strain identified Europe earlier year. part population leave alarmed (god forbid) following rules (by mean health guidelines) would people promptly stopped reading headline.

I swear, “it’s hoax!!!” “muh’ free-dumbs!!!’ contingent sub gets little funnier every day. really starting look like we'll wearing masks forever... kids, substitute parents. teacher care child parents do. Feed school, deal traumas created home neighborhood. One element seems missing: timely reward good changes. seems like every ambitious idea leads improvements general living conditions far track motivate sustained effort. attention spans demands quick results properly calibrated endure sacrifices inherent major course correction. Wait Communist States America? forgot check California still twentieth country cases per million.

I'm surprised Louisiana cases per million New York seventh country. ebay.com e-commerce website allowed posts comments. 

If believe made mistake, please let us know.

Everyone knows time young teachers make shit pay. knew well spending time money getting Masters. pay specifically decrease year COVID something? funny violent entities actually end power? say peaceful protest works - doesn't.

Peaceful protest works fine, provided people charge smart enough recognize violent protest next step.

Or, put another way, *only* power violence. power, anywhere. Civilization general, peaceful protest particular, effort keep us one remove violence.

A Peaceful protest warning. ""Imagine guns. talk like civilized people, start killing other?""

Sadly, people power tend sense recognize this, deal peaceful protests seriously. area still considered hot zone reopened schools already. Half students went distance learning option, half... could known? I'm sorry driven resign. I'm sure that's saw career ending. I'm even sorry district acknowledge done there. left district 7 years similarly, never even got acknowledgement letter (and even describe email months). really frustrating, sad feeling. think now...China pay it. care should, $1(lol). scapegoat want. one singing song. entire world is.

Cold war started, Germany US forefront it, basically world China. reason China origination Covid 19. One way China pay. 

Do research. know hard find country love bad guy, fact. Covid 19 originated China. hard fathom suggest raise voice take stand government. One voice enough create waves change.  young, qualified person wants teach, issue finding job. No, I'm saying long time. Online learning amplified situation. difference pre-covid post-covid extra person explain decision to; micro-managing final grades. I've argued multiple times best interest poorly performing students fail. need consequences unwillingness engage course content. always extreme pushback administration; look bad many kids fail. pressure stays teachers pass many possible. locked entire country guessing 1.5 billion people month , case count hundreds, including areas cases

This seems like poorly conceived strategy. India geographically pretty big country, like US, China, Russia, Brazil, etc.. virus unlikely spread everywhere, time. makes sense strictly lock local hotsports occur, leaving rest country pretty much alone support entire economy. 

Its like covid peak NY, medical staff coming parts US help. states chipped help sending medical supplies NY. NY started get better, help went way. ridiculous claim. doesn’t mean total deaths, 6% *~really~* coronavirus. means 94% cases, underlying conditions play time death coronavirus. 

And, Americans underlying conditions. read list, comorbities listed as: influenza, pneumonia, diabetes, upper respiratory diseases, lower respiratory diseases, heart arrhythmia, obesity. 27 year old healthy person happens heart arrhythmia. Plenty Americans athsma. Around 40% America obese. trying prove here? let people die underlying condition? son sent picture bar overflowing people masks near Pac Heights lives. course that’s true. see too. Guess also see?

idk lol Chinese bots sub insane  way would quarantine elderly immunocompromised allow (not mandate) rest return. None yet done way.
 
Just imagine Sweden would done this! much lower death per capita *and* far lesser economic loss us, U.K., Spain, etc. it’s gonna impossible eradicate covid. that’s unrealistic. Plus there’s new evidence 90% positive cases aren’t actually transmittable... lot false positives way deadly percentage wise Agreed Given current events immediately thought Bama given headline. Found ProFa thug solution scientist would suggest, paper lab would work. problem real world behave lab conditions. messy complicated. KUTZTOWN University? da f came name? Maybe that’s part root cause imagine administrations totally throwing teachers bus, giving proper PPE protection, increasing work loads classes reducing planning period time, stripping benefits offering shit pay expecting teachers pay supplies

Remove PPE part shit already happening teachers decades. people seem give shit? corona maidan 

western sponsored overthrow event pandemic brought several good side effects hope become normal continue beyond pandemic (masks, social distancing, distance learning). wonder focus testing vulnerable people left unprotected. economy would ruined, would problem left. You’re joke! Mr. Jokey McJokerson! hardest part whole thing people taking seriously. I’m always lecture fiancée getting close people wearing mask properly. Makes look like bad guy. It’s really tough neighbors parties kids together playing don’t let kids go play them. “Few catch it”

Two infected doesn’t exactly refute claim. Happy cake day fucker☺ novel virus means nothing people

Fortunately people like throw existing knowledge previous viruses instead fill gaps ever bullshit feel like. results something notion immunity exists post covid max ~ 2 months? therefore, reinfection possible? saying person reinfected without new exposure? Ty explanation countries deaths per capita. Unless prospects vaccine absolutely collapse early 2021, Sweden's going enough time make ground lost front loading deaths early that's even assuming Sweden second wave. Brazil US countries close passing Sweden point Mexico France quite bit behind them. think million dollars retirement saved lifetime wealth /u/intothemirror speaking to.

Obviously not. Accumulating million savings/retirement time retire uncommon middle class workers.

But start talking hundreds millions, billion, ect, people rarely 'self-made'. Boris Johnson PM. changes.

dead one especially big ones.

..and go ONCE. I’m sure you’re smarter I’ll leave that. great day! 

Edit... snippy again, sorry: mean though, worth fighting about. Please great day. basically hybrid format right now. classes online component. they’re going end making tests available home, like 2 classes already doing. 

Honestly need punish Greek community heavily this. They’ve partying bid week. see results. Good thing I’m American hahaha corona maidan

a western sponsored overthrow true, death rate rabies almost 100% hasnt died out. Almost DNA RNA replication humans pathogens alike replicates certain rate missense mutation thats leads development different strains. difference even outer coat virus affect virulence may subvert someones antibodies affective one strain another may lead reinfection. Hey say he’s sorrey. Good. Glad see someone taking seriously see dead people. 10 year old loves virtual school. 6 year old hates it. March? We've knew understand. miss taking toddler library play time reading kids. look forward taking swimming lessons things like line. sure aware Erie County, Bills play, hovering around 2% infection rate that's high NY State moment. Al problems, live shithole country. mean , cool countries people social distancing beating covid-19 teaching job actually well paying job. Wrong. Turning offices housing would best thing happen general public. Especially London. Hmm, paid agitation new front open Yes. People numb numbers. 3500k day sound bad compared 15k day two months ago. reality, that's still friggin bad, especially since testing went much. brother teaches, saying one big problems district substitutes. Mandatory quarantines there's positive test, district already stretched thin. pay $65 day someone sub. lot takers right now. ask support. Seems okay lack accountability mass genocide. China definitely knew kept hidden till got control. blame that. think fake... least them. Many think real, reaction overblown causing damage virus itself.

But news headlines come make sound like bunch rednecks decided virus exist. Take look RI handling it. move there. Plenty nice places live increase home value. know people come back taking seriously... pretty much completely unenforceable Nope, countries far lower deaths per capita, US 564 deaths per million, world average 109 deaths per million. number deaths per capita US currently increasing faster virtually every country except Brazil same, yes. differences inconsequential mainly lie genetic makeup.

It'd like saying can't compare Siberian Husky Wolf. pre screened trial, aren’t even starting shots area couple weeks get two shots, think month part. way there’s data election. Fun fact, Robert Kennedy Jr. part conspiracy demo Berlin yesterday even gave speech. desantis needs get head examined. Even virologists said single reliable data point confirming outdoor transmission transmission via surfaces. Linsey Marr one scientist, forefront charge get CDC recognize aerosols primary route transmission.

I honestly can't believe we're still discussion. insane detracts fighting virus places matters most.  I'm going handing masks beach later today. fire dept city couple months now, people much better wearing masks media portrays. Coming symptoms waiting results? thinking? Another important life skill recognizing sarcasm internet.

Also, never end smiley. That's condescending. theory (hypothesis actually) lead poisoning much wide spread problem saw Flint MI

It basically fact now: yeah exam required right? ( genuinly asking) mean vaccine wont time soon. going postponing exam? got teaching certificate. best worst time looking job. Virus lives matter everything started, wife insisted wiping groceries cleaning produce got delivered. I'm wondering, necessary? lot recorded transmission surfaces like mail, packages/jars grocery orders, there? literally way prove good teachers don’t make difference.

Actually are. There’s lot different ways approach education research couple:

1.	If teacher adopts new teaching style scores standard metric improve teacher’s (who adopt teaching style) scores remain constant, safe conclude new teaching style (and therefore teacher) “made difference”.
2.	We also trace institutions. track scores students belonging teachers went specific teaching program compare similar teachers attend teaching program. studies often include lots data, really strong case program. instance, program research studies indicating education would, average, lead 10% improvement scores teachers.

In fact, claim, teachers “make difference”, correlation student improvement teacher actions, disproved weekly education research. many thousands factors effect improvement students classroom it’s honestly overwhelming. want get started suggest google topic interests education google scholar.

There, make difference? :) sure ""Sweden 2nd highest death rate country!"" means, since kept schools open valuable relevant [data learn from.](http://inproportion2.talkigy.com/finnish_swedish_study_26jul.html) Sigh. Please research next time want debate something publicly. car manufacturers Nash (in 1949) Ford (in 1955) offered seat belts options, Swedish Saab first introduced seat belts standard 1958.  the Saab GT 750 was introduced New York Motor Show 1958 safety belts fitted standard, practice became commonplace. **Seatbelts popular first, 2% Ford buyers choosing pay seatbelt seatbelt laws United States began introduced 1980s faced opposition, consumers going court challenge laws. **Some cut seatbelts cars**.

So no, 30+ years seatbelts invented, people actively using seatbelts completely defiance. That's government make mandatory. people fuckwads like now. 

If someone wants wear pair goggles everywhere, that's choice would better world shut fuck opinion keep yourself. 

I hope enjoy rest weekend. Well, fair, expected adults US throw tantrums act like babies who'd rattles taken away them. things certainly over, family Canada friends Europe, they're mostly returned normal, certain precautions, etc. 1. Officials said months socially distanced open air exercise perfectly safe. want go jog bike ride wear mask avoid others fine.

2. need much space exercise. clear 3x8 space got enough room workout videos Youtube. happened tell to—shocker alert—wear mask. surprised yet medical authority find topic contradicts point? Maybe don’t actually know public health issues people decades elite education, training experience public health do?   first two planning days constantly people (fire safety inspector, custodians, maintenance, teachers) entering room without masks. put sign door ignored it. Fortunately someone power must said something suddenly everyone wearing mask next day. live OC correct, leave house seems like business usual. 

They telling us cases down, anyone tried get test OC? tried, $125. Ugh reminds someone follow social media, one folks body positivity think overweight medically significant. went headline last week. article obesity makes vaccines less effective. ""This ridiculous! 40% America overweight, deserve effective vaccine?!"" tried explaining something write articles every year cold flu season approaches, exactly ""news"" one ear, other. like people want something outraged at. Yeah that's case. Anything keep one admitting his/her beliefs coronavirus wrong. Haha, yell back; mind business! lol naive. 10000 morons. Given strict terrifying law enforcement Singapore is, that's hardly surprise. nearly eradicated never tested never reported. expect government act responsibly instead pandering different groups maximise election chances.

Masks all, enforced sane way parking fines , massive testing , massive contact tracing.

Instead hear ""Oooh, culture used masks, cant possibly ask that!"", ""Ooooh, thought need 30k test per day, gave 40k requests! Yes, sat whole summer hands could guessed second wave could come. Ooooh, pity ""

Then need shut anything night clubs mass events. beg differ.

Says 49 year old. mean cases deaths yeah way many. goes show apple fall far tree. Good. live LA imagine kind shape we’d stuck plan instead caving Memorial Day. one month economic growth set us back two months least. Well I’m arguing fly living averaging around twice month. 10 years perhaps body used it. remember couple - colds last decade. Haven’t flu almost 20 years. quite lot collaboration China vaccines, think governments ruling anything. Regulatory approval vaccines difficult, Chinese organization brought vaccine US Europe before, may waste money try large western pharmaceuticals may vaccine available west done. say plenty demand china countries vaccines may worthwhile pursue Chinese vaccine makers. Imagine blaming president something that’s control. stepped issued EO mandating every school must open, ever school must closed, he’d ACTUALLY fascist many claim is. Instead he’s left individual jurisdictions, system government designed work, everyone losing shit. know rare is. people gotten virus tests genetically sequenced. Agreed, Im American live abroad. many people ask I’m concerned Trump, say I’m concerned 150,000,000 people voted him. mouth piece nearly half population. Well yah. let's honest, ""diversity"" exactly helping western countries right now. definitely helps country like 98% homogenous. Yep. serious case asthma take Advair. Good luck paying pocket. still people COVID19 positive undiagnosed/unreported. could 100s moving around, living normally, without realizing sick. known cases reinfection RNA sequencing proved reinfection relapse. Maybe reason second wave 1918 flu deadly. 29.8.2020 another demonstration Berlin ""for freedome peace"" see similar. main reason always called Corona harmless healthy population. Protection required vulnerable part society. Protecting vulnerable people means function economy around. case many countries. wonder happening winter arrives. September 1st Eh. Boris leader Conservative party. know that's enough Reddit automatically hate without critical thinking whatsoever.

However, never floated sort conspiracy theories coronavirus. made wild claims. consistently listened experts country (Chris Whitty, Patrick Vallance etc) followed advice, changing messages advice changed.

It's wishful thinking believe whole crowd conservatives even right wing. Anti-science people come sides. anti-vax people often left wing hate big pharma. anti-GMO people usually left wing. natural remedy promoters. [Removed] always liked idea politicians wear sponsors suits like nascar drivers. Time general strike. Moar economy! Despite need space, UA still required incoming freshman class (6,764 students 2019) rent on-campus living space. Dorm prices vary depending location, UA website suggests students budget $9,000 per school year rent. Freshmen required order $2,056 meal plan semester. Er... honestly think America place world immigrants? Japan tons immigrants. Singapore many different races label ‘Singaporean’ doesn’t even designate one race. actually tack ethnic race word Singaporean want specific (Singaporean Chinese, Singaporean Malay, Singaporean Indian etc.) There’s 4 major religions living harmony there.

I think might riding wrong train thought probable cause there. both. make Trump administration happy. I'd rather colleges retire die though. mean, absolutely need better resources guidelines, reality impossible given funding. options unprepared virtual lessons get covid. I'm glad chose unprepared frustraighted. I'd also rather kids miss year school get sick possibly die. retired teacher come back force covid done, dead one cannot. 

I know making point this, wanted sure said. parents? Boomers. People beliefs choose facts support beliefs. case, probably people fearful COVID feel powerless. get that, want believe hoax, protest loudly enough over. evidence stacked particular belief easy invent conspiracies support view. perhaps particularly draw droppingly wacky one never wear mask. Teachers value lives. selfish.

What fuck wrong world? oh right, helps. Thanks lot reminder well wishes. saw something somewhere like history necessarily repeat rhymes. Got thinking. country founded consolidation actual nationalism , whereas common good everyone engrained culture.. many different sects people trying control other.. feel culture best. japan Japanese people Japanese. America Americans black , latino , asian, White , native Americans , Indian , Muslim Etc.. race different mindset it’s always one group people usually top decisions here.. Japanese government members ethnic Japanese, people likely follow advice people look like them..

America wicked place , years haven’t learned anything ever... person using wrong denominator. I’m middle school teacher 120 kids across two class periods. It’s extremely challenging manage. Can't second wave, first one never ended sad huge reason quit simply can't lose health insurance. Shit indoor dining closed like month Texas. restaurants super packed. It’s fucked Well people die, less people get right Sure, virus somehow magically unlike almost virus we’ve ever encountered, exceedingly low prevalence reinfection we’ve observed impossible coincidence recorded history, sure. still idea whats going African countries, like ventilator per million capita. can't get herd immunity diseases natural infection. 80% suffering UK experience mild symptoms.
so - expect like know already virus experience nothing winter's cold. suggests maybe thick another way looking it, still cases factor three one day country Vietnam (a country almost five times population Florida) total entire crisis. Yeah, root really need strike right wing media.

But we've waited long literally army (already armed teeth) fanatically zealous disciples Uh, no, that's correct. 

The sample size people who've genetically sequenced twice far, far lower that. 

And even then, two different strains count proof, reinfections strain even count. sure. know indoor gatherings much much worse. simply pointing families gather backyard things quickly go window. also need honest people masking inside relatives house. 

I bring backyard gatherings implicated recent spread state. Well, religious gatherings. World leaders suck right now..look leaders .. Johnson, Trump , xi, bolsonaro , duterte, Ford, Putin. It’s like world run idiots!! Oh horror. \[Look happening working 45 hours week still spending hours day helping kids assignments teach use laptops... Hard time everyone.  one Winnipeg (Canada) today too. many people attended. must group they’re part happening day. switched daughter online public school almost 20 years experience accreditation. virtual learning art we've amazing first week. safety comes first terrified everyone option. That's Asia, general, culturally collectivists. exceptions, large people like ""rock boat."" easier conform buck looked suspiciously.

In contrast, western cultures, especially American one, individualistic flavor. Bucking trend (whether justified not) applauded conforming want rock boat seen cowardly.

Both norms pros cons, think one better largely subjective individualistic collectivist tendencies scale.

But see, individualism covertly taken advantage masterful disinformation warfare. US pass Sweden soon tho Yeah Europe went exemplary model second, third waves anti-mask protests. They’re already back March level daily cases. Europe fucked. Yeah, too.  never bad media says. someone working grocery store since june(quit recently), say people like godsend.

I get ruffled many things, feeling get someone decides wear mask register fun experience. supposed tell put mask on, point, risking health random dude's monetary gain. herd immunity works. I’m kind mini gathering today parents complain whole time- guarantee it. tell teacher want. already know. It’s admin states won’t let kids fail require teachers prove exhausted options fail student. teacher, really **isn’t** online learning work mandated above.

Not mention lot us forced live stream- 2 cohorts live kids front us classroom put zoom meeting “teach” remote kids way. expected effectively teach students physically front us ones screens simultaneously. It’s literally impossible effectively reasons you’ve already mentioned plus way more. Rally ended 8/16. 
Are good epidemiology basic arithmetic.  


Let's start simple: many days month? “The reason is, part, poverty. Lima, capital, nearly one million people lack running water. Many extended families also live crammed small homes, making social distancing impossible even tested positive.
But also rooted routine flouting law here. Peruvians often debate source unruliness, frequently blaming lack “values” cultural legacy Spanish colonialism. definitely case official corruption ineptitude, arbitrary red tape, hardly encourage citizens respect authority.
On August 22, 13 people crushed death stampede police swooped unlicensed disco Lima’s gritty Los Olivos district. Twenty-three people also arrested, 15 tested positive coronavirus. Supposedly “clandestine” party, sound system could heard block away.
Although usually less flagrant, socializing thought country’s principal source new contagions, especially family meet-ups, often traditional Sunday meal.” UV light air dispersion kills dissipates virus. real transmission risk indoors extended periods airflow. Go hike! Go biking go see nature. Lack sunlight excercise months end comes high risk. go hang mall, yet one caught covid19 fresh air, regret it. We're heading fall soon, seize moment go enjoy outdoors.  Wtf even comment? seriously replying teacher he’s concerned upcoming school year *scolding salary negotiation?* Please get internet awhile. feel evidence shows though. Inside gatherings much worse. People going inside use bathroom masked though. we’re going screwed weather longer good outdoor gatherings. Yeah, security important. read guides, addressed early teachers learners... mean, giving lots children devices cameras... that's sure increase vulnerability there's probably going interest phenomenon child pornography mafia child molesters general. course NOT. likely fomented social media.

QUIT FOMENTING INSURRECTION, DAMMIT no. deliberately trying spread it? 

I would wear n95 day, require students wear masks times. won't, send them, maskless, principals office. still planning playing football games right?

with crowds?

yeah, they're fucked -- rest us lived Bay Area 17 years moved Virginia weeks ago. People pretty good part here, nothing like Bay Area. Plenty people around go Walmart mask, lots people still go restaurants, etc. hyper vigilance Bay Area, hard get used to. thank doing! power you! population must scared follow rules. conspiracy nuts going use say fake right? teach school windows. room 150 students divided 6 half walls. Even though cases 1 percent here, still scared. Inside packed venues unmasked morons yes. Outside packed venues unmasked morons, also yes. failed USA poor republican leadership across country leading uneducated think they're opinion fucking matters instead following science. followed science like rest fucking developed world we'd mend instead 175k dead. Instead knee deep there's vaccine billy bob dumbshit dropped high school listening idiot paid way life tell hoax distract fact he's getting impeached. Booooooo. must needs undercover whistle blower. 

Balance. course resign

Haven't payin much attention Fl, ya? bad shit comes Ron DeathSentence doubles down. florida, get large part income probation Drug-addicted high school dropout ex-cons several major issues this, even disregarding fact would potentially cause blindness skin cancer. Many natural synthetic polymers degrade exposed UV long periods time. Many colour inks, pigments, dyes degrade rapidly UV light. indoor environments simply designed receive large amounts UV radiation prolonged periods time. organs null void. Nobody gets them. Also kill even attempting save me. organs also null void. feel like anger wildly misplaced. hear someone concerned teachers, reaction shit *their* throat, pandemic priorities different? war trying win here?

Just feels like seriously misplacing energy right now. basically saying they're many cycles eventually picks things yield false positive? mean... like fighting forest fire keeping hoses individual trees long extinguished without paying attention burning hottest current moment? man, knew ""me first"" here, know would intense, slight inconvenience worse actually killing someone. wild I'd go work coffee shop you. food absolutely fabulous always, servers hotel staff well. heat really got though. going vacation, even consider trip Madrid midst summer, well, vacation. prioritised actual reason (and sitting quarantine home it), sightseeing even visit beach.
Still, situation changes, I'll happy return actual vacation spring autumn 2021. :) respect returning school? Well that’s long answer I’ll try keep shortish. 

Basically school level admin pretty quiet “hands tied” also state constant flux district state receivership didn’t really principal last week. superintendent (who came us Hillsborough County Fla “turning district around”, well commissioner governor adamantly want schools open person. likely funding money tied happening. 

For context, buildings crumbling, windows hvac ancient nonexistent, bathrooms rarely soap, mold leaks... families low s.e. strata, multigenerational homes, parents keep working options. perfect storm. 

There rallies, open forums, surveys, etc. doubled said ok well push back start school 2 weeks definitely person. said 70 percent families want can’t produce dataset show it. 

Then, moving contractual start date forward two weeks, added 4 PD days end summer less 2 weeks notice. person PD.  

The Union pushed back. gov/sup/commish asserted Union complaining they’re hearing anything actual teachers. (What the?) wrote letters admin chain requesting person PD made remote. said no. 

That’s like “ok ridiculous I’m many years I’m losing much ground” noped eff out. 

Gov. making announcement tomorrow, I’ll keep posted. One hopes soul isn’t entirely sucked daily job, active useful making noise needed change things. positivity rate higher 5 100,000 

Case rate?

Because one positivity rate testing low. India generally richer areas impacted. denser states badly hit. unlike US UK poorer ethnic minorities hit badly. Oh no, one 12 Starbucks city might close down! Let's see councils slash rent hopefully we'll see return small independent shops cafes. Make cheap someone open run small business maybe people drawn back high street. Working home amazing employee, great employer too. Businesses save fortune electricity costs sell office space housing development whatever. They'd outrageously stupid force workers back pointless, expensive, potentially dangerous office environment. stopped months ago - control virus.

And staying home quality life thing, want cost money.

do want get 5 catch 7am catch 6pm home 7.30pm?

Or want travelling turn computer 9am turn 5.30pm would office?

I 6 years. Also:

* likely single. Romantic loneliness joke. 
 
* likely social lives centered outside household. grapple question ""what level social interaction acceptable right now?"" lot say 38-year old living spouse kids stressful. Honest question: remote teaching difficult enough make teachers quit? 

I’m university student remote courses past, though haven’t taught remotely. I’m sure would make much stressful conventional classroom. required disclose statements sponsored content, like YouTubers are. impact globally complete utter collapse

Eh idk, think might. people 50+. customers anyway.... understand 23 year old employees care. fake news. repeatedly clarified press briefing mission completed simply mission make plans. Investigation origin probably take years decades. People dropping like flies denying reality whole thing. think that's praise for. Aside said, absolutely correct, *think* saying second.

You're saying bag-boys put loved ones harms way, food fit neatly bag, means teachers also put harm's way? getting A, B, C? Why, put certain people harm's way, mean put harm's way? possible, £480bn spent somewhere coffee sandwiches more.

The losers vocal - - things shifted feet without notice bleating 'unfair'.

The world fair, commerce fair, life fair.

Yet many life actually improved since February yet calls reversed. fair. Fuck Florida. sufficient sleep. It’s amazing lack restful sleep affects body. daughter turned 13 literally 3 days son born. loves course helper nice. Dealing toddler teenager issues tough. 

The biggest thing us like look know kinda sucks sometimes he's baby... sacrifice that. eventually understand that. Honestly imagine overall easier 5 year old baby. teenager least occasionally reason dealing baby toddler. $55 Oklahoma. Extra $20 certified teacher willing accept long-term. I’m sure schools continue run thoughts prayers here. said anything caring public health? shut get back work, economy hurting. like US early July, wait deaths go up. one point 70k nre cases day 400 deaths still. long tail deaths well US 45k new cases day still 1000 deaths weekdays. Yup Fucking finally It’s good time life insurance parents willing go get sick leave kids Certainly there's evidence silent treatment effective! Yes. I’m TA giant time suck sucks. Sux. suuuuuks give shit. maybe try keep life normal-ish help mental health. know CDC guidelines social distancing, etc really harping on. believe healthy immune system starts exercise proper diet clue you’re talking about. Grocery store workers front people short period time, plexiglass protection, masks sides, high ceilings good air circulation, etc. Teachers usually none that. 
Also, Sweden *2nd highest death rate* country! Get facts straight. They’ll relax criteria become teacher anyone Bachelors degree it, kids suffer even more.  stopped investing improve bussiness long time ago. issue atm right next flu season. want people go back school, office etc. saying going deadlier. UK government absolute joke since started. March/April save NHS, deadly virus can't take risks. oh deadly young willing send back. 

Probably protests going London. message changes nearly every day. necessarily mean struggling. could well reason they're partying poor mental health brought pandemic broken willingness care. depends talk around here. parents irrational. personally think shows everything can, number retirements too. teacher friends wondering everything asked year. Administration’s response split class among teachers, hide behind mantra following CDC guidelines “to best ability”. Get fold tables, buy 5000ppm ozone generator two 150W UV-C bulbs, wemo switch, Alexa hang table. Hang painters plastic around enclose table easy lift bottom adding plastic loop. Voice controlled timed disinfection. Total cost $200. disinfect car full groceries, mail, item fit. Best setup garage place easily vent ozone. Gotta get kids’ $$$$$ Sex needed ones survival. Breathing is. 

WHO reports warned china close wet markets years, Chinese government nothing. Even open. husbands sister first year teaching Tia worked pre school/4K program years we’re terrified both.

I’m environment there’s choice within 6 ft someone without barriers various points day.

My husband situation people testing positive nearly every time they’re tested.

We’ve masking since late March early April even though wasn’t mandatory state month ago.

Our daughter currently unemployed industry hit hard Corona. we’re grateful home one ways we’re able reduce exposure risk (besides observing guidelines course).

I ptsd built Crescendo course thirty years likely diagnosed. It’s abuse, neglect, witnessing crimes, catching fire, nearly dying once. There’s that’s story another day.

But single terrifying thing I’ve ever dealt with.

It’s worked hard get life hands people incapable basic human decency.

I can’t express properly words infuriating is.

We’re diligent mask wearing following social guidelines one person doesn’t mask wash hands exposes us illness don’t believe real intentionally willfully ignorant about

There goes livelihoods, savings purchase house, financial health rest lives, probably bit sanity.

I released therapy unmedicated months (close year) happened can’t say anymore.

Between rate I’m discovering people really months intense stress I’m grateful every day excuse hideout home regularly. People look say, ""oh 77 health issues don't."" ""the hospital said died covid probably died something else got marked covid."" want go *way* topic second. said 15 year old toddler. middle deciding kind year disparity works. advice someone 12 year old thinking another? get that. I'm talking group people closer age. saying people pre existing conditions overwhelmingly likely die coronavirus, something CDC saying day 1. 
Millions Americans least one comorbidity including diabetes, hypertension, obesity, asthma, alcohol drug abuse, depression, etc. 1 would put 94% category. 
And honestly, 6% perfectly healthy people dying coronavirus pretty shocking actually.
How’s this? Can't say disagree. Silver lining mortality rate much lower here. idea why. hope gets soon. Crypto infections? Hmm... That’s good, aren’t willing job get outta way someone else take job. what? Disciplinary action Li Wenliang style? virus cannot define futures' - Sturgeon

It going change, many people much invested Old World allow New World get grip.

All articles lockdown - chance change terrible things put decades/centuries, trend - go back old ways losing much money. Doom! Doom!

Pollution, environment, wildlife, congestion - things going change, one allowed out.

Now - always was. China built empire backs teachers. India. Teachers basically oligarchs day Greece.

Prussia exist without them, king realized important education recruited/overpayed best one, sending country future lightning speed.

List pretty endless.. dictators specifically target teachers. incredibly respected feared understand do.   keep forgetting FEC short quorum too. toothless Jesus. plus Supreme Court... wouldn’t bet money Biden declared winner Make sure plenty alcohol ready ~~evening~~ ~~week~~ month. thegatewaypundit.com may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

I give up. hearing other. good one... heard someone suggest using existing local television bandwidth broadcast classes directly home. seem like bad idea considering connectivity software issues people having. forget residence hall fees, hell, even parking fees. must keep educational priorities order kind ironic, considering DeSantos exactly sharpest light bulb garden. NYT article got pulled one Iowa 70 percent positive test cases didn't? CEO FLORIDA MAN county cases college students came back school. county's case count exploding.

As friends family county, knew bad idea I've dreading moment. hope remain safe. Maybe revitalise town centers commuter towns. would big plus *gasps* “We take virus, push somewhere else!”  I'm surprised died. I'm surprised exercised caution nobody else either. Talking specific group people obviously areas science studies different results. That’s systematic reviews meta analyses. take body evidence look majority says. currently majority available evidence says kids spread virus effectively. available evidence even suggesting kids spread virus studies looking viral load found noses, know viral load isn’t even indicative infectious someone is. studies don’t hold actual weight. think says something people inspire learning people aren’t willing learn something supposedly love new way. mom 63 year old teacher. 100% prefers teaching person certainly ripe retirement. Quitting would easiest decision right now. Instead spent entire week glued computer learning new ways job starts tomorrow. get it, year collective kick nuts everyone it’s surprising teachers can’t teach teach new way. speaks volumes generation teachers opinion. HIV happened country, simple that? 

UV light Petri Dish Demo sure, relies people actually wanting centrist centrist themselves, that's i'm seeing around world. much talk immigration labelled racist places now, pragmatic centrism people start civilised one another there's middle come together anymore; time soon either seems.  boyfriend considered quitting, visas tied jobs. Either risk corona going school risk corona unemployed separated home countries. fucking sucks. That's bath tub filled disinfectant. kids take dip 5 minutes fully clothed every time come back home. also wear masks learning online, never know dangerous virus truly - keep getting new study results, all. listen Madrid? missed annual trip miss terribly. gonna make upset! mask working, care numbers! Feeling Ohio. come subreddit remind that, YES, are, fact, still midst pandemic and, YES, government large portion population still really care! 🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️ Yup. It’s fucked. I’m sure yet know I’m whatever damn time want room alongside 26 9 year olds. FlU /s problem places unions power places barred teaching life lose retirement. That's reason either. Vaccine trials huge N multiple year follow-up. cost much object AstraZeneca, issue Pfizer.

If *nothing* else data 6+ month immunity yet one would want many globally dispersed sites possible such. can't. even solution??? parents young kids work. must children must child yourself. people home working high exposure environments, way try keep safe.

Just home mean safe. Spread home worse spread public. cannot spread home someone catch public first, focus is. presuming vaccine forced effectiveness safety testing done.

Russians still successful crap? dummies plentiful ever imagined, Russians playing game perfectly. Assuming states, masks ""affront freedom"" bullshit.

I'm gonna wearing mask permenantly commute UK on, likely permenantly. typical human response can't take responsibility. direct reflection leadership problem, chief. neighbors effective though. South Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam reasonably successful too. argument falls apart hard. Education past used even route learning everyone wants say kids better critical thinking skills.
