0,2021-07-08," girlfriend part statistic. apparently getting vaccinated giving 100$. got whole thank email it. pretty cool CDC's 3-page document care feeding Pfizer transit temperature monitoring built shipping containers display green light package stayed cold transit.
(and evidently email temperature log!)

Note temperature recordkeeping required. Indian may fine thousand natives America I‚Äôd beg differ 1.4 billion Indians India would fine calling natives ‚ÄúIndians‚Äù Family paranoid new variant. fully vaccinated mom wants stop meeting friends going gym. want go back normal goes summer vacation N95s pretty good Why? Athletes used crowds lol  ? Google 3rd Moderna dose, absolutely said they‚Äôre running trial it. isn‚Äôt news requesting authorization yet it‚Äôs complete yet, hope available fall. I'm sure impact thinking FDA CDC, although doubt many people get booster impact worldwide vaccine roll-out. Still, bad look. honestly know that. kept seeing news Delta enough positive news. Hoping jabs get delivered quickly! Oh, I'm ready. I'm also education currently. I'm school counselor (not school). advocate step son. goes catholic school. We've advocate before. pretty sure abbott allowed bars open may lockdown march-april. 

i live dallas thats memory it. 

people wore masks grocery store. bars restaurants closed month. ""capacity"" literally...like legally... way enforce it. 

i live part dallas strip clubs big latin dance clubs looking snap chats places maybe 2 months lockdown PACKED. every night open. masks (like would even matter club hundreds people)

they tried tape playgrounds parents tore down. 98% kids never wore masks playground even height it. 

they even started remove rims basketball goals get people stop failed jist gave essentially. 

not saying 50% county caught it...but dont underestimate terribly stupid texas is. sorry went mother going through. ok? able get treatment now? yeah believe ... believe indiana tbh. city called city churches many stop conspiracy bullshit. believe good majority people rural areas always spoken That's case decades. Farmers group largest recipients government aid programs categorized subsidy dont cry socialism.

Regardless much money anyone know received local, state, federal government programs farmer ever come across received double. Lots speculation, since FDA may decide approve booster, would probably available pharmacies. 

Like you, received two doses Pfizer. probably going make sense get booster different vaccine - decide make available. *Doc take ventilator away... I've intubated Lord!* referred real Americans instead native Indian. Nobody ever thinks it‚Äôs going happen them. Turns out, someone percentage people get sick! It‚Äôs number, it‚Äôs people, they‚Äôre one them.  mean really sick? Hospitalized, ICU?  even mean anyone else finding limbo period knowing resurface serious way nearly unbearable? wonder they‚Äôre worried people independently seek third shots without fully vetted? Idk. Maybe also trying encourage vax hesitant individuals get first shots? wrong. Columbus got wrong.  They‚Äôll definitely kick basic technical training pretty readily certain undiscovered undisclosed medical stuff, penicillin given due conditions boot camp itself. wouldn‚Äôt make sense kick people it, get it‚Äôs never given preventative thing. uptake shouldn't. probably at-risk patients. Someone please explain indigenous people still called Indian (including themselves) day age? Japan 15%+ fully vaccinated state emergency Tokyo. giving away? tell first one people putting danger? That's reservations 12 beds hospital want high mortality rate. close entry points isolated hard time ""source tracing."" regret giving hospital care. made beds; sleep them. one going stop anything wait booster shot. Right FDA even think necessary. 

If booster becomes available, people get won't. one wait others get it. comment automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  LOL agree! baffled truly. terms, Black personally finds ‚Äúunpleasant ears‚Äù?? cannot sure mortal enemy biggest trading partner time. Right, right. Canada da best, USA da worst. 

Speaking literacy issues, know US still vaccinating .1% adult population every single day? means 70%+ adult population reached less month. 

80% needed? According who, Trudeau you? cite studies definitely state 80% needed nothing else suffices? Like things booster shot, speculation . . . 

The data mixing matching doses (first second doses) UK showed made sense got AZ vaccine get Pfizer second dose. got Pfizer first shot, data showed immunity (as measured titers) similar getting second dose either AZ Pfizer . . . T-cell response seemed better got AZ second dose. 

Adenovirus vector vaccines - AZ J&amp;J - thought advantage stimulating T-cells, long-term protection component immunity, data makes sense. third dose adenovirus vector vaccine (J&amp;J US) would probably effective third dose Pfizer - LOT spectulation even know FDA authorize booster shot. 

I got two doses Pfizer vaccine. choice third dose, would select J&amp;J, due data mix/match vaccines cited above. second choice would Moderna makes sense get something little different. third (and final choice I'm US) would third dose Pfizer. 

If Novavax gets approved, would make decision tougher . . . Dude point that‚Äôs it‚Äôs WEIRD AF you‚Äôre even black yet claiming term black racist / demeaning / unpleasant ears??? It‚Äôs Native Americans left. forgot human body actually leukocytes immune system

No, didn't. studied virus found 1) causes horrible immune-related attacks people 2) order prevent that, vaccine helps immune system function better. 

It's called science. Inbred hick. curiosity, Covid‚Ä¶what it? mysterious illness blaming? tribal lands par 3rd world nations quality life unfortunately.  worked contact tracer last summer fall, required speak families friends people tested positive covid-19. Based experience think I'm well-qualified answer question. answer is: Fuck no. rare

That makes feel better getting it. It‚Äôs websites read made sound like it‚Äôs rare still concern 50. Thank you. sierra. Lima coastal cities, not.  Yeah, literally last week reading story mRNA vaccines may good many years, potentially life- week it‚Äôs doom gloom waning immunity need boosters. 

I‚Äôll get one becomes necessary, damn ups downs news stressful. Sheesh, I‚Äôm sorry. 
As soon immunosuppressed 14 year eligible friends got vaccinated quick succession, fully vaccinated get spend time together year apart. 

Stay strong, I‚Äôm sorry friend less integrity group 14 year olds.  rather imagine American Indian experience smallpox, like, ""Shit yeah, I'll vaccine right now, thank much.""  Exactly. 

Being Black Black people chose black mean like American Indians choosing Indian means. may offensive hear term Indian way Black grating ears. But, that's Black people chose called, that's call them. Indians want called Indians? say anything else?  Aka Dunce Cap.     right since it‚Äôs seasonal thing, it‚Äôs flu year round? Tons people never get flu shot either. many won‚Äôt get covid vaccine. either seasonally stop world every season admit overreached hair no?  We‚Äôve year lives stolen this, told patient vaccines come, life return normal, obedient followed rules got vaccinated, told need vaccinate elderly return normal, 60% population, 75%, 80%. I‚Äôm beginning lot respect states like Texas Florida opened earlier pushed back public health, say callous didn‚Äôt care human life, mental health quality life? 33 given 2 years prime life this, it‚Äôs looking like forever. Vaccination rates EU countries almost perfect many EU countries end August, 80-90% uptake complete vaccination. one instance appeared war tacit. condoning biological warfare all, that‚Äôs still different circumstance traditional narrative. 

How people handling blankets first place manage get sick? use smallpox survivors ?  black doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre color coalüòÇ serious internalized problems mind instantly equates black Jew insults.

You interact black people, it‚Äôll help get tunnel-vision world view. know sisers coworkers husband died covid 31 years old they'd 1 year old year prior . Really heartbreaking think virus altered many lives ways can't even see yet. It‚Äôs definitely differs place place. Philly full Catholics Irish Italian descent pretty much every one know ha gotten vaccinated Jew specific. American broad. 

I've never heard anyone say they've 'americaned' leaving store. many times heard people saying things like 'That place Jewed me' 

Take that. anything inherently different what‚Äôs third dose compared previous two? Yes. essentially stopped there.

You're 54% total population least 1 shot.

Canada shy 70%. 80% needed, nowhere near close. Canada passed total shots delivered per capita, despite vaccine supply issues, we're still delivering ~9 shots per 100 people per week. US 1.5.

You end ranked subpar front 6 months, like literacy rate.

You protected enough stop another wave coming fall.  think people going agree you. ""at-risk"" patients going want additional level protection get. groups probably right.  west coast TX Covid. things total lockdown months EVERYONE wore masks. liberal part TX though. Take upvote get out. Saying Native American tend hold job administering land stolen people generations ago behalf government stole arguably pretty bleak.  Well far risk toddlers risk almost negligible. Sure yes risk young ones healthy there's higher risk driving store things.

Yes careful, risk tiny toddlers specially perfectly healthy. Local metrics hold value, Local leaders job right. Else clusterfuck incompetence. US lagging behind likes UK, Canada, Israel soon EU respect vaccinations, especially got first dibs whole damn population.

It's shitty people sub harder people doubling importance vaccinations rather ignorant 30% country can't put ignorance egos aside get damn vaccine. Woah....dying bad thing happen get covid? TIL  You‚Äôre going let kids live lives they‚Äôre going fine.  I‚Äôd like point Peru actually tried pretty damn hard, didn‚Äôt resources cope Covid months end. You‚Äôve never heard someone called fat, stupid American?

I guess american slur too. use literally anything slur say negative inflection.  What's amazing absolutely closely numbers related....64% + 34% 98%......you could almost infer 1:1 Trump voters getting vaccinated. Hint: they're actually India. still use word Indians? pretty good data widely available want know going COVID-wise (vaccination data, case numbers, bunch stuff). [Our World IMHO, best, makes easy look data across different countries (perhaps little reliable info anecdotal data one guy park :) 

FYI ...

* Canada administered doses US (per capita)
* Canada vaccinating high rate currently, prioritizing first doses whole population, almost second doses now... easy get fully vaccinated Canada currently.
* US still higher percentage fully vaccinated, probably 10 days... many people getting second doses every day Canada vaccination site actually local Indian reservation. whole travel ban keeping families apart. actual Indians lol. makes sound ridiculous best time interval mazimize immune response? provide info references. Thanks. Unlike 2020, when, sure, people died, people cared deeply would live forever, free curse death! Oh, whole world could forced injected scheduled regimen vaccinations every six months til time indefinite world could like used be- magical place everyone love lives forever peace! dont doubt all. 

Take recent wave UK example. vaccines- theyre likely seeing THIRD major surge deaths endure another lock down. already two big surges, around 50% total population fully vaxxed today.

This virus still jabs it. good news areas US Delta's becoming dominant strain we're already highly vaccinated. lowly vaccinated areas? Good look. could get sad again. talking 6 months second dose. Let list countries percent fully vaccinated. Malta, UAE, Iceland, Bahrain, chile, Aruba, israel, Mongolia, Uruguay, qatar, Hungary, Curacao, UK. 

Counties behind US Spain, Germany, Canada, Greece, Poland, Lithuania, Austria, Canada, Belgium, Switzerland, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Italy, Ireland, Netherlands, Denmark, Luxembourg, France I‚Äôm going go go ahead stop there. 

Also UAE really one list significant population high fully vaccinated numbers. countries front US whole except UAE, Hungary, chile less population US states. 

Massachusetts Connecticut would move number 4 5 spot behind Malta, UAE, iceland countries  

Also put perspective, think large US is, it‚Äôs total population. Hungary Malta EU countries higher total % fully vaccinated versus literally US Malta population 500k. 

Also put perspective. next list US would Spain Germany 42% 41% states, would put around 36 37th place. Let‚Äôs highlight states better vaccination numbers countries. Montana, Kansas, Nevada, Kentucky, Alaska, Nebraska, Iowa, South Dakota, Florida. 

 yeah, you‚Äôre right. US totally SIGNIFICANTLY behind western countries. Even still stupid. Actual Indians still exist lol one says one says this. valid non-immigrant visa, go visit family UK allowed back US, I've lived last 4 years, without spending 14 days bridge country. myocarditis happened within two weeks vaccination ‚Äî right way ‚Äî OP said. mean, link posted bold header titled ""Boosters"" statement planning give boosters time.

Are preparing boosters? Sure! government also planning variety wars, humans aliens. mean likely happen though.  grandpas immunocompromised either.  nice. Rule 1. ‚ÄúHere Florida host fucking summer olympics two weeks notice‚Äù Never heard guy, looks like Bruce Willis hard work medical staff going past year+ still deal people wanting vaccinate, least get ""I told so"" ridicule them.  It‚Äôs definitely universal. Every native met doesn‚Äôt like called Indian unless it‚Äôs another native person. aren‚Äôt India, term relic dumbass colonizers. Indigenous people fine Yes avatars audience back September guaranteed

Hilarious, no. Lockdowns never happen US again. could see *some* businesses closing restrictions put place combat variant, full-blown country lockdown happening. Presidential order banned Europeans another one could quickly reverse it. nothing visas. submission linking google.com automatically removed source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Natural Selection work eyes. Well sht Sadly do... aunt believes even told vaccinated grandparents that. :( two weeks!!! real time I'm super cereal [That's true 41% White Americans vaccinated, compared 34% Black Americans. vulnerable vaccinated won‚Äôt anywhere near rate last year. Opinion piece Damn sounds like doctor needs re-read Hippocratic oath districts teacher unions bargained masking all. difficult get vaccine first months. wonder booster? want know motivates people downvoted comment. exactly people solid footing science common sense ought want, we're feeling spiteful. 

The answer clearly education, biology class fitting. 

The problem now, society decided individual freedoms rule greater good, direction experts matters affecting us whole roundly ignored (and ignorance celebrated diversity ""different strokes"") soon someone raises freedom flag. 70% small number still small number. think visa process vaccination. Sounds like fear mongering can't read article. hospitalizations near zero take much increase 70%. highest vaccination rate world, ones need luck? mmmmkay  definitely is, there's nothing deterministic it. random. there's evolutionary pressure able spread vaccinated individuals vaccinated people around. course, mutation may arise infectious unvaccinated **and** vaccinated people. We're speaking relative terms here. Anyone refuses vaccine dies COVID worth feeling sorry for. made choice met consequences Gotcha, thanks!  shot though. different thought. misspelled Chinese tourists. both.

Most children get seriously sick, mean wont affected COVID, transmit COVID, provide opportunity COVID mutate. Kt recommended certain age group? keep asking see data breakthrough infections. ages medical conditions? sick getting age? thinking someone like might need third shot, 25? make good decision without data? found mouth breather. Trudeau ain't perfect perfectly acceptable like politics, he's literally putting people's safety political reputation. that's true leader. agree everything he's done, claiming right people little fucking stupid. Yup, got second dose April, said ""last time"" woman registering said, ""Until booster."" People get flu shots every year, tetanus boosters every ten years‚Ä¶ reason think three-shot series even yearly booster cause problems.  wish we'd sever terms colossal hubris dumbass Columbus insisted landed Asia.

He still causes much confusion. people getting vaccinated are, large, rural white conservatives. Black people seen enormous loss communities due COVID. selfish super-entitled, ‚Äúskepticism‚Äù made self-serving. Exactly, vaccinated measels, immune it.

The vaccine gives degree immunity.

You dont need everyone fully vaccinated reach herd immunity, need degree immunity.

AZ gives around 70% protection first dose only. second raises 90%. 70% lot!

Even 50% like first MMR vaccine, would still lot.

You dont need pin hopes 90% doses reach herd immunity. need enough degree immunity. already 90% Yes, post deleted said 70% population, incorrect.   Yeah waiver 2 pages long tried read said zika virus something else got yelled sign keep moving flipped first page 2nd one said brain bleeding middle page signed it.

Im still guess whatever took sorted out.

This happened 2017  Oh they‚Äôll believe it. Unfortunately, may lose couple people care deeply about...and that‚Äôs makes whole thing sad. that: real, cohesive community. People care enough fellow humans smart thing. rest United States fallen far since, say, WWII polio pandemic. Full morons believe quack doctors vaccines shyster lawyers want make billion class-action lawsuits. sad. Evolve* Actually 70% adults received first dose. person catches common cold (a viral infection) like nearly hundred times lifespan, cause autoimmune problem?  far aware covid vaccine free everyone America even insurance

So need go insurance backed pharmacy. go place shot recieved   Like updated target Delta, etc., stuff that's focused Covid Original exist anymore? Thank this. You‚Äôve made feel better given sense relief. person go get 3rd one since many tools want one?  saw pediatrician said thinks November elementary kids. also said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure make delta variant.‚Äù

I hope it‚Äôs September though.  Yes. if, c'mon people. didn‚Äôt say was. 

But it‚Äôs ‚Äúeasily preventable curable‚Äù simply creating hygienic conditions, isn‚Äôt money invested infrastructure accomplishes this? 

Why overcompensate address symptoms creating ‚Äúvaccines‚Äù instead correcting *source* problem?

That alone shows so-called ‚Äúptb‚Äù aren‚Äôt interested solutions. need chaos run answers problems created.

It‚Äôs health, it‚Äôs control. Full stop. can't really compare US countries though they're still limited supply. Vaccine uptake good areas, huge i.e. 100% among 70s Ireland, UK Nordics.

The UK 12 week gap doses young adults getting first one now, yet fully vaccinated people US. London young population, course many people vaccinated there.

Delta hopefully result significant hospitalisations since practically vulnerable vaccinated. can't said US, even areas high uptake far between. Oh gotcha. don‚Äôt know thought would something would get kicked military, lol   Need HELP/ADVICE - people COVID still need get vaccine? 
Can someone genuinely answer friend refuses get vaccinated due already COVID. says necessary immune spread covid rate someone vaccinated - true? terrible 5G reception inside COVID ward? Reality vaccine = mask [just ask people already COVID considered immune?  


Can someone genuinely answer friend refuses get vaccinated due already COVID. says necessary - right? literally go everywhere without mask indoors. Like seriously outside recently? Delta overblown. go ahead terrified, means nothing rest us.  Saying covid isn‚Äôt threat kids misleading best. Kids much less likely catch it, less likely severe disease, less likely long term damage covid. However, still small populations kids develop MIS-C damage it, isn‚Äôt immune compromised kids. nephew one - 8 yrs old time, active, healthy known medical co-morbidities, poverty.

Are chances kids getting sick extremely low? Yes. mean say fuck nothing mitigate risk control? course not. Take whatever measures comfortable regarding kids, also keep mind don‚Äôt choice.  I'm DC well, going Northeast 2 week summer vacation roadtrip.


While legit things want anyway, I'd lying vaccination rate low spread factors.  Tribes?? title says American Indians. Let's put differences aside curry on. race delta variant 2nd doses. Black face said this?

What unvaccinated politicians business people? actually showing work well *after 6 months*, working well *vs. delta variant*? going difficult disentangle data dominant variant changed time, also important distinction. also seem note vaccine remains 95%+ effective preventing serious disease, arguably important protection. second Moderna shot, tied hell. Slept full 530 630 following morning worked 12 hour shift pouring concrete 18"" forms one guy. pretty shitty day going matter what. point is, second shot really hit hard. heard stories im close rougher time nothing severe enough even describe here. knock around, I'm truly sorry felt shitty. Would experience detract getting booster? 

Me personally, hope open got different brand well. I'll jump right front line occupied I'm applicable. Safer keep little niece nephew, better feel.    Hence, like said, OP saying business told they're allowed require masks BS. discussion third dose cause much stronger fever-etc. side effects kind makes point well, right? Stronger faster immune response spike protein, memory cells, = side effects. I‚Äôm Canada, guys still call aboriginal/natives Indians? Good work Belgium! Proud them! Cases may rise ultimately, deaths avoided life relatively go back normal soon Native Americans‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ American Indians‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ wtf Columbus! incredible really causes spike. one instance, someone received negative test result error data entry test lab. barcode test scan properly, staffer entered numbers hand made typo. negative test result sent person got tested went night out. next morning, error found called inform positive.

In instances, results sent time due congestion system, people went back complain given negative test result created manually, without even checking actual result was.  needs plastered everywhere get rid vaccine hesitancy new plans build factories produce vaccines? Seems like theyll needed years come.  case Netherlands, adults eligible. issue folk age 30 getting first shots last weeks. Blankets Actually, I'm totally fine forced vaccinations. Imagine scenario ebola contagious covid people started going around pretending flu again. better believe govt would go full lock mandatory shots arms asap. waiting emergency approval. exceptions. Throw economy trashcan keep everyone home since can't future economy everyone's dead. Let Pfizer/Moderna develop vaccine 2 weeks immediately start manufacturing shit. Well, ok... guess cancer patients people compromised immune systems exemption, everyone else... 99% population: üíâ üíâ doubt it. stepmum's siblings ardent anti-vaxxers one said ""I'd rather get COVID vaccine"". still get vaccinated even though stepmum see (she type-I diabetic, vulnerable, fully vaccinated weeks stage). Furthermore, vulnerable age group could double vaxxed weeks now.

It's them, entire community, country fully opens 19th, delta variant simply rip unvaccinated community. Unfortunately think least one stepmum's brothers die it. would hope smallest population especially indigenous folks would high vaccination rate! US needs continue taking care native people themselves! don‚Äôt act like Canada since least 1912!

Btw, aren‚Äôt American ‚ÄúIndian‚Äù... Native American. sad, local reserve, Six Nations, two languages less dozen people speak it. extinct years, decade tops. Weird. look like India.... Natives/Indigenous.

Indian someone India. 

Indian derogatory Canada Latin America.    Maybe it‚Äôs economic then. Pretty strange 50% Americans vaccinated, yet 100% Americans stopped wearing masks. guess Honor System dead. Ah, bad. Adding asshole list. different toddlers adults vulnerable vaccinated, need masks?

I‚Äôm trying understand documentation europe vaccinations foolproof.

We basically apps use prove vaccinated.

Qr codes scan check valid everything.  Work Korean medical facility. Four people office unmasked around walked in. reported could gotten us shut 10 days. Yup thing over. gave year lives. It'd done. true. rez lost quite two family. fought hard get vaccines.

 Let's forget clinics sent body bags instead PPE requested battle Covid.

A large portion still unvaxxed due distrust government things like small pox blankets recent history, boarding schools, forced foster care adoptions, forced sterilization many women 60s 70s, though went til 90s. got Pfizer vaccine late January got covid end May. symptoms lessened. I‚Äôm glad got vaccinated annoyed ended covid anyway. Let‚Äôs hope booster gets approved soon. Hopefully it‚Äôll make difference. Patient vaxxer here, holding Director‚Äôs Cut edition Vaccine 100%. Israel saying two doses around 60% effective Pfizer. yeah, I'm done masks too. Sources?  worrisome know know mask prevent spread. sure vaccination rate have, low end bell curve. think they'd care, they'd denial ""Some may die, that's sacrifice willing make"" Yeah we‚Äôve let people stop wearing masks, way people going go back masks. We‚Äôve let genie bottle. don‚Äôt know apparent vaccination isn‚Äôt issue. Maybe issue valid documentation vaccination? read yesterday working group created solve issue EEU travel US, sounds complicated. 

Also, member states EEU pushed hard allow US tourists crucial financial reasons. It‚Äôs high level push EEU tourist dollars I‚Äôve seen.

It may EEU needs tourists US. isn‚Äôt true experience though. order triple vaccinate I‚Äôve gone different vaccine centers said undocumented immigrant order get Pfizer, Moderna, J&amp;J shots. bed ridden week 5th shot I‚Äôve never felt better protected covid. extreme spike cases totally avoidable vaccination evenly distributed age groups. Spain, Portugal Netherlands see increasing numbers 30-year olds aren‚Äôt even eligible vaccination yet. Makes way sense distribute evenly 60-year olds slow spread.  high American-Indian populations* 

If gonna keep using term ""Indian"" least put ""American"" front it. thought talking us actual Indians. Exactly, it‚Äôs like redditors haven‚Äôt taken economics 101. wish covid vaccines mandatory kids school next year. work Kindergarten wearing mask day cute kinders wear one tough! kids champs it-way better adults.
I looking forward masks coming school year. knows happen? Anybody else feel like discrepancy Moderna Pfizer saying need booster FDA CDC saying won‚Äôt another reason people get vaccinated? It‚Äôs getting increasingly harder tell best interests, though seem feel like little bit cash grab companies. I‚Äôm getting tired conflicting reports worried vaccinated people taking Delta. went confusing stupid. Good know previous reply good faith. 

If want cape wholesale ownership word ‚ÄúIndian,‚Äù go ahead. suddenly waking versus centuries/generations use same. great analogy case. experience foreign viruses coming killing huge numbers them. People thrall ideology able learn anything. growth rate Delta UK actually highest 1-2 weeks ago (UK higher 2 dose rate US point), can't compare UK May. Using vaccines, exactly?

Would nice make priority last year, given entirely responsibility - hey, government actually done anything successfully? Rosstat publishes Russia's mortality numbers regular basis shows far higher excess deaths reflect severe undercounting. government poor job containing pandemic exactly covered up. Dirt doesn‚Äôt contain rsv virus, child‚Äôs daycare still essentially sanitary bubble due lack viruses spreading amongst general population. Considering USA displaced genocided native folk much existence, surprising sadly. reals. don‚Äôt see logic. Operation Warp Speed Trump‚Äôs baby. wish Trump would taking credit getting vaccine quickly encouraging disciples get vaccinated. It‚Äôs frustrating. German chocolate cake German, point word different meaning meaning change time.  1. Reinfection natural immunity, and
2. breakthrough infection vaccinated immunity 

Both extremely rare occurrences happen around extremely rare rate. 

There evidence implying friend needs get vaccinated top whatever natural immunity developed. little evidence suggesting either. 

That ""we know long natural immunity lasts"" different vaccinated immunity, form immunity virus. even argument. mean they're recommending booster shots 6 months anyway better protection \*AT LEAST\* 8 month protection natural immunity? Lots people denial UK threads.

First cases supposed top 25-30k stay there, yet peaks 100k mentioned, matter cases nobody gets hospitalised, hospital admissions rising fast still nothing-burger.

I mean clear vaccines work, also clear delta cause problems even countries high vaccination rates. Severity problems see thanks UK's approach couple weeks...  Nope Conspiracies. comes conspiracies. Cons susceptible ""evil government"" conspiracies, Libs ""evil corporation"" conspiracies. Unfortunately, apply vaccine: made medical corporation, rolled government. plenty hardcore Liberals know get vaccine they're ""natural hollistic"" need want anything bodies come straight Earth, reason companies engineer chemicals thing body. Conservatives know like vaccine pushed Liberal government (I'm Canadian). cases, conspiracy theories bullshit internet nonsense tell vaccine evil, different reasons. Lol you‚Äôre right, definitely went head. forgot that. bad  [Information Philips Company makes machines weren‚Äôt natives America? someone tell Pfizer Modern effective Delta Variant. keep seeing data Pfizer Delta Variant Moderna. data helpful?

Also, tell think okay vaccinated unvaccinated americans let EU, can't fly US im fully vaccinated (in 2 weeks) see girlfriend family seen 18+ months now.  American Indian Indian Americans native Americans? always get confused. literally know single person gets flu shot, free unless old otherwise risk. mean around 20‚Ç¨ want it, that's enough people say ""naaah need anyway"". arent indian.

Old *old* people will. Young people probably there's decent campaign registering easy. Boomers probably won't.

I'm still trying get mom take first fing vaccine, even though longer ""hurr trust it"" camp, still keeps putting later date ""busy"" ""there's rush"".

She's retired sits around nothing day time, clear. know Americans rejective naming parts country already excisting countries but... litterally Indian country 1.4 billion people already... Growing Canada native friends, although would refer Indian way black person may use n word, much white people saying ‚ÄúIndian‚Äù refer them. differences could regional generational though mean Native Americans.  it‚Äôs like all. mixing two things

‚Äîindian indian spelled same, seems like word

‚Äîindian refer two different groups, seems like two different words

just use word talk two different things doesn‚Äôt mean don‚Äôt see difference things. call two things ‚Äúbats‚Äù one animal made wood. hand sometimes two different words refer thing‚Äîlike pancakes hotcakes. fact indian refers two different groups doesn‚Äôt mean can‚Äôt recognize difference. tribes generally use ‚Äúindian‚Äù rather ‚Äúnative american‚Äù guess erasing culture?   real, thank covid something least. mean it‚Äôs like foreigners invading pillaging lands, raping women, poisoning food sources, nearly wiping origin history real life american history books anything dying language cultural practices. 

I can‚Äôt imagine blow foreign invader occupier culturally. Lmao that's one way put it. I'll agree 100%. vaccine hesitancy I'm though, worry. home country ordered much mrNA enough fully vax 35% population guess wishful thinking now. cases rise 5x before, could happen little rules place, chances you‚Äòll amount people hospital, counting vaccinated people experiencing breakthrough cases (e.g. older people immune system unable mount sufficient immune response).

That would true randomly vaccinated people, haven't. focused people highest risk ending hospital. Virtually fully vaccinated know US data fully vaccinated people end hospital.

On specific topic hospitalizations people thread drastically underestimating efficacy vaccines point dooming.  +1

also- im springfield MO strip clubs dive bars essentially. fuckin things MASSIVE lol. honestly didnt even know strip clubs werent hole wall joints moving side town. Apparently. pretty confusing.

They‚Äôre literally saying comply die. 

I want people nice other. Treat people like people like nameless faceless disease vectors.

I also caught covid last November recovered easily. took two shots moderna January probably people eligible. haven‚Äôt transmission risk quite awhile now, even took vaccine probably didn‚Äôt need comfort others left far ill covid did. Yet forced endure endless mask theater 6 months constant infectious disease vector six months straight, masking 10 12 hours straight every single day work. goodness.

But global responsibility think that's like world health organization. I'm mistaken former dipshit president America cut funding lot ties presidency.  I'm sorry saying shot gives covid? zero evidence that. guy saying learn last year make mistake. never made mistake never opened much like since corona pandemic.

Even try compare last year March, test events vaccinations. also mass test March, thing saw hospital numbers exploding. comfortable would vaccinated people feel going gym California right now? precautions would take? overall reluctance seek healthcare period TBH. yes newer medications vaccines it‚Äôs obviously struggle get us take advantage things. Gottlieb book sell private sector likely independence deciding many interviews appearances make.     Seems accurate. Hell lot people states don‚Äôt know difference tribes essentially assume every native Cherokee Navajo. yes, natives generalized quite often dismissed country. Nah he's Indian-American.

* COVID real, deadly disease
* far contagious harmful flu.
* striking communities awful rates, targeting precious elders.
* COVID vaccines effective preventing disease.
* COVID vaccines safer aspirin. 

There's also fact U.S. Government given tribes room administer programs vaccinations ourselves. (generally) trust tribal governments least care, even always succeed things. instance, lot tribes Oklahoma got members vaccinated even offering vaccines non-members long state government (run denialists) got act together. One favorite sayings. Also: can't fix stupid. UEFA member FIFA, still completely separate organizations. nation member one member other. fair, say black wrong skin colour. 'Black' negative connotations currently preferred term us (uk currently using bame 'correct' terminology), looked linguistically, could easily deemed offensive point future doesnt stand well scrutiny (as points out, one actually colour black, white people generally white colour, skin tones far complex that). 'Coloured people' previously accepted term obviously deemed offensive (for good reason given historic use) linguistically meaning identical 'people colour', currently acceptable. Language changes calling people want want called basically  Jurisdictions allowed mandate masks. Private businesses whatever want. Dallas County can‚Äôt make wear them, Walmarts Dallas County want to. 

But, blunt honesty, pretty much everyone said YOLO masks recommended best days. yet see business actually require see fewer fewer people time. Worldwide deaths (that actually reported) surpassed 4mil. God knows actual number are. many kill over.  Probably trying get vaccines sent poor countries try slow spread deaths instead know hogging Western countries cause far shown America vaccine job protecting people fully vaccinated contracting Delta variant might reduced efficacy like 97% like 93 still hell lot better countries zero access like 0% population's vaccinated like countries shit spreading getting chance mutation went Costco last week 6 year old made wear mask. kept pointing unmasked kids. 

Thank God state 70%+ vaccination rate.  people still hang cell phone? people play football hands? still CC e-mails? still rewind streaming video? people asking faulty etymology *Indian* still sound like broken record? 

Same reason: word enters language, unmoors etymology. meaning drift, enormously. know *girl* used mean child either sex? *nice* meant know anything? *buxom* meant docile obedient? Meanings drift. 

 word leaves language, never makes sense given etymology. reasons.

Unmaskedchusetts know of, I've seen data people vaccinated AZ/Pfizer... seems Turkey making advances third shot, hopefully we'll get data soon (I guess that's authorities Chile taking time officialy announcing third shot).  proud may be, smart enough care one another single unit protect other. lesson us. Love little green state. Depends European country. Germany Italy UK track get much higher vaccination rates USA, France seems way something similar USA, Poland perhaps similar reddish state USA. look poor Bulgaria :( According German article, first batch new mRNA already produced BioNTech Mainz. targets full spike protein Delta variant. Clinical trials could commence amazing. Updating vaccines seems like quick software update. trials done, might new variant already...also, worlds even vaccinated once, yet say need booster already. new plans scale production? Covid really seems driven surge nationalism internationalism, like weird jealousy hoping another country fucks worse country.

So many people seem willing one country's plan worse plan. People complaining restrictions, see another country lifting saying ""ha good luck that...""

You see vaccines too, ""ha good luck X vaccine"", ""I've heard variant like hot knife butter country use vaccine, thank God use Z""

How many people see really saying ""great hope goes well them, good us works"" compared comments saying ""that's stupid work, thank god we're that""

I'm trying defend one country say another approach better, I've seen people praising simultaneously scorning Australia trying covid free instance Breaking: people experiencing consequences hate it. Wait till find Covid make impotent obvious US, sure would think US country divided Covid. caused division Crises make rich richer. incentive power prevent them. *Satan misinformation, seems like spreading fear nonsense. also really seem understand mutation replication works. 

Most vaccinated people get sick. vaccinated person comes contact virus, replication barely happening, isnt enough time mutation spread one even iccured stage necause neutralized body replication happens, meaning mutated virus replicate. virus body, immune system reacts immediately, vaccinated person virus neutralized immediately. 

Partially vaccinated people still much, much less likely get sick, less likely get severely sick get sick all. less severe illness less virus replication therefore fewer chances mutation body knows fight virus.

If vaccinated person get sick likely hold onto immunity partial immunity vaccine (this people), people normal, encountered different version virus still likely get severely sick unless virus different enough. 

Mutation happens every single person catches virus happenstance imperfect replication similar way cancer happens. mutations benefit virus, do.

There time bomb vaccinated people. threat vaccinated people unvaccinated mutations create. 6 monthly/ yearly jabs true well, guess title could considered correct accounts... headline say COVID surging. article say that.

It says Delta variant surging.

So got Delta going like 3% cases like 50% cases period like 6 weeks. surge? think so. 

Now, lot nuance this? Sure. think NPR trying trick people thinking COVID surging state? No, think may overzealous assumptions carefully people read headlines/articles.

Is large risk vaccinated folks? No, think article really trying push notion good deal discussion unvaccinated Mesa County great vaccination rate.

Was focus outdoor music festival dumb? Yeah, think Dr. LaCount worried we've seen virus really spread outside I'm sure Mesa County sorts riskier behavior occurring. Delta Variant different? Maybe, really discussion Delta Variant impacts spread outdoor setting. ‚ÄúWould fine me‚Äù. thats fine must fine everyone? referring happened due covid colonization genocide native Americans North America terrible unforgivable get wrong want clarify apologize asking question curious  really weird, I've seeing posts bad ticks year particular, I've gone bunch walks/hikes woods year seen single one.

We fairly robust data even asymptomatic (unvaccinated) COVID extremely damaging organs; outcome T-cell-cleared disease among vaccinated look like *that*, look someone who's never sick? Answering question gets least partway answer first question -- really one I'd love see data on.  Maybe right - get sentiment west, want vaccine, get it, we're rapidly approaching plateau around 50/60%, really sucks. It‚Äôs partisan issue Canada. Vaccinations seem thing levels government agree here. people need utilized PSA ads. Maybe help.  Except true!

I hate misinformation UK. starts vaccines amazing post supposed intended fear mongering people suck numbers.

I claiming are, example said:

&amp;gt;Cases wise last time similar place (case numbers trajectory) mid December admitting &amp;gt;2000 people hospital day.

That true. real data would lull move back effectively zero spread months, new wave begins.

That December, Early September &amp;gt; Late October.

There small reduction, wave got worse December. Moreover cases higher positivity, cases missed.

Anyway October - end October deaths spiked. Nearly 2 months beginning surge. 20-50 people daily, around October 20th jumped 70, following week hundreds.

Will happen wave UK? Well no, like said meant fear mongering. keep seeing ""30k cases 9 deaths, back December 1700 deaths"" look actual data, compare last wave actually started... (End august/beginning September) lag roughly 1- 1.5 months deaths started skyrocket.(and similar number cases well, stop comparing December/janurary lol)

Deaths also increase hospitalization, hospitalized overburdened. People would otherwise live, die crowded hospital. 

The wave UK started End May/Beginning June.

Like said meant fear mongering, starting see uptick deaths. vulnerable safer due vaccines, see waves 2k dead daily, mean upcoming wave going tiny. even seen deaths yet.

I hope wrong, people pointing UK right really wait least July August half way through. would love wrong, like said bad previously people forget cases missed cases(if get 10k positives, likely 12-15k actually infected, UK getting 70k cases, likely 300k actually infected, COVID death rate 0.6%... Well 1700 deaths * 166 = 282,000 cases).

Also October 2020 admitting 300-600 people hospital daily. 

Kinda like 3-4 hundred now! previous waves, cool UK numbers like 2 months using example proven yet? country opposite. Anti-mask right, anti-vax left. Fully vaccinated means receiving doses waiting correct number days last shot.

What suggesting would require everyone get regularly tested antibodies.

And says nothing B-Cells &amp; T-Cells. example, think body currently producing antibodies measles. However, vaccinated measles means quickly produce needed. leave people refuse get vaccinated self-chosen fate rest us continue live normally?

Or force vaccination them.

I‚Äôm good either way. I‚Äôm going back editing day day order keep incredibly foolish people alive, refused free help offered. 100% agree. episode 2 weeks second Pfizer vaccination. riding mountain bike snd uphill stretch ( done many times before) afterward heart/chest HURT. Like sore actual serious pain. continued evening, along fluttery feeling. actually said husband go get hospital once, feel like could heart attack. 
I felt better next day I‚Äôm bit nervous strenuous exercise. 
I would still vaccinated heartbeat snd would take booster needed delta. COVID much dangerous.  Everyone sub said J&amp;J enough/‚Äúyou‚Äôll fine J&amp;J‚Äù people asked, mRNA vaccines 10% less effective basically imply vaccines fail.

Most world hasn‚Äôt even first shot yet, especially third world countries. people care 10% personal protection booster ‚Äúto protect immunocompromised‚Äù like said. Maybe lets vaccinate world first protect human race? plans scale 1B doses 2021 2B doses 2022. imagine somewhat self serving get rich countries buy another round two things e.g. scale manufacturing R&amp;D booster prevents symptomatic covid, seems Delta data showing.

Basicly thing unless kids 13 home. understand good group. many selfish people country don‚Äôt give shit group.    True, link obesity covid death tolls, got it. good friend. offensive, incorrect People saying year people absolutely love lockdown restrictions. hard evidence. rural bumblefuck states accepting shipments vaccines one getting Oh, definitely happen. ""leaders"" spineless take meaningful action ANYTHING unless going line pockets. might come somewhat snide, reading quotes makes valid criticism:

*Dolsten said early data company's studies shows third booster dose generates antibody levels five 10-fold higher second dose, suggesting third dose offer promising protection.*

Why focus antibody levels? offer meaningful long-term protection, inducing stronger immune responses likely increase risk developing severe side effects. would keep efficacy numbers high antibodies wane, may within 6 months. Useful can't risk infection circumstance; i.e. sick elderly. 

Maybe bad article, sloppy remark make, Pfizer lead scientist even.  I'm trying figure many people US received one dose using number doses administered vaccine type. Here's know.

**DOSES ADMINISTERED 
Pfizer - 184,073,920 
Moderna - 135,297,225 
J&amp;J - 12,708,959

Approximately [11% (CDC) gone back second dose.

**SINGLE DOSE PER PERSON (using information)** 
Pfizer - 103,410,000 (Doses / 2 / 0.89) (Not entirely accurate many people received first dose second) 
Moderna - 76,000,000 (Doses / 2 / 0.89) 
J&amp;J - 12,710,000

The sum approximately 192,130,000. That's **57.7%** total population. According data % adults population vaccinated compared whole population 94.9%. calculates **70.7%** adult population vaccinated least one dose.

The [CDC 183,237,046 administered **55.2% (67.3% adults)** received least one dose.

Clearly CDC information I'm using, still wonder much is. always try use date data CDC I'm kind curious. someone knows surveys work tell seems way aren‚Äôt ton American Indians, it‚Äôs based percentages compared demographics? love northeast too, part, ticks terrible!!! outdoors ruined me.  makes happy considering government sent Native health center Seattle fucking body bags asked supplies.  Maybe start looking deaths instead cases, despise huge increase remain stagnant. one point live virus. Yup, Vermont amazing last saw. 67% fully vaccinated covid cases like single digits day. like 1 death week that. wish states would follow suit. Luckily cases Delta even show-up spread quickly. I'm glad hear this. Early pandemic, acquaintances mine skewing towards pandemic skepticism, highly distrustful medical care since everything happened 70's.  Oo, links?  easy find exemption. Boy took lot liberty saying ""Delta Variant Surging."" Colorado seen uptick cases deaths headline says ""surging."" Fearmongering spoonfeeding media finest. us wife along daughter vaccinated, parents, son young it. pray school starts kids 12, I'm holding breath. Abbott Texas allowing schools require masks, really hope rolled back school starts. I'm really sure we'll do.  Sources? 

I‚Äôm OC, quick search don‚Äôt argue they‚Äôre exactly expecting.) post obviously wrong stupid lies?

Seriously.  fake account, post fake bullshit, post ridiculously stupid things, why? watch Singapore, almost exclusively used mRNA vaccines, documented spread vaccinated individuals occurred. Even vaccinated individuals. vaccines fantastic preventing death severe illness LEAKY. ‚Äúperfect‚Äù vaccines convey sterilizing immunity. reason vaccinated information consider. think it‚Äôs FDA approved, hospitals like OhioHealth require it. like flu shot mandatory. study train wreck, I‚Äôm surprised CHOP promoting it.   interesting. suggests vaccine prevents contraction covid means someone vaccinated, concerned anybody else is. don‚Äôt Indians go something else? Bharat something cool sounding. You‚Äôre buying misinformation. Long covid thing. damaged organs, loss smell (and maybe hearing), etc still live. I‚Äôve heard gangrene possible symptom delta variant. probably survive gangrene, want lose appendage? risk things happening increases mutations. time goes on, you‚Äôll longer ‚Äúhighly protected‚Äù. idea it‚Äôs needed either. Even body armor fail let bullet pass even rated stop bullet. time stop bullet. That's simply effectiveness works. Nothing 100% effective... credible scientist believes Covid could mutate much would entirely evade vaccines?  likely bet reasons. Pfizer incentivized squeeze much money possible, boosters way that. huge chunk first world people refusing get vaccinated billions less fortunate countries chance yet.. means see new variants pop coming weeks months. new variants already proven vaccine resistant lowered efficacy original Pfizer vaccines requiring new round booster shots. given this, probable new variant resistant booster shots emerges Pfizer happy keep tweaking mRNA vaccines selling government combat them. yeah, 4th 5th shots highly likely. isn‚Äôt universally case, oftentimes actually created programs entirely.

The feds delivered vaccines, everything distribution-related purely driven tribal governance. 

(And least near me, extremely generous excess doses.) ‚Ä¶ opposed COVID19, *definitely* associated cardiac inflammation I'm disagreeing you, read ""the Delta variant surging"" becoming dominant strain, COVID-19 cases increasing dramatically. I'll grant that's that's ""technically true"" way word makes things sound worse are, wanted give slightly different take!

Cheers! Texan envious. state local government along community think over. masks, vaccines, everything 100% open. almost thinking Delta. Texas cases raising 25% daily, hospitalizations going up, seems one cares. Covid local state news all, peep Abbott anyone else. county's daily covid reports moved week now, guess we'll find today we're doing.... though I'm encouraged it'll good report. protect kids, keep masks on, hope best see Delta sink back unvaccinated circles community. wish people would make clearer often. seems huge difference. That‚Äôs nice. city county vaccinated drop crazy get outside city MN. suspect lot Midwest way. Oh sure. Thanks providing context.   Well, prefer things like Zuni.. collective noun, Indian used. 

Why don‚Äôt drive Rez ask them. stop worrying much educated better people stoopid anit vaxx Dammit. know *your* question rhetorical. Ugh. German person, Italian person, Jew.

That doesn‚Äôt sound polite me. Shoot, know seen youtube ads. believe it, focused vaccine sure, smart people. get CDC FDA. wonder hemming hawing issue. Yes, fans science would love actual damn facts, stands reason people sneezing heads might certainly spread covid others, vaxxed not. wonder Georgian feels Atlanta coffee Peru much hotter.  that‚Äôs call themselves. 

It would seem rude, otherwise. naturopath movement making money hand fist shilling natural cures. friend goes schill told ...put arms out. Look left one dropping. take vaccine kill you. Here...take instead. kidding. seen since February probably never can't convince matter much information provide get damn vaccine. Forget math reading. teach people critically think schools! study like this, sure participants contacted time time, either *be* prompted *feel* prompted report side-effects.

----------

On different note, Germany, health authorities provide app pretty much beginning vaccination campaign, people could use report siede-effects. idea ""fishing"" unprecedented large number vaccinated people, would precise picture side-effects. idea went smart-phone made equal provisions people like (excluding large swath elderly reporting side-effects process, digress). get can‚Äôt mandate vaccines kinda. make everything require instead. want sit home whole life go ahead access. convincing people hesitant getting vaccine best interest.

Hopefully gets full FDA approval soon. Making vaccine mandatory university students military increase vaccination rate percentage points. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

FYI - vaccine 100% get approved current form. whether take months, thing. went looking it, find it. remember seeing one point that, iirc, ~98% doc's get flu shot required. True, might prevent antivax nurse breathing next person.  Yup, even know folks immunosuppressants.

They advised take big gap doses, dose got delayed could get vaccine. math teacher understand exponential growth. Anything 1 exponential growth. would always doubling anything 1. Even takes year. Exactly. That‚Äôs assumed. doctors office I‚Äôve still masked know they‚Äôre vaccinated. know. They're basically bot lazy misinformation. Unfortunately, cant let people like slide.

Ivermectin school district allowing distance learning allowing masks. superintendent told can't order mask mandate since governor rescinded health orders. There's overlap ""Jesus' protect me.

How impact marriage?  nephew young vaxxed another family member health issue cleared vaxxed yet. still wearing masks reason going large gatherings. eat restaurant crowded (I'm eat gluten-free restaurants next impossible anyway). friends see vaxxed. Mine is. body, choice.

That work abortions, too?

Also, certainly choice refuse vaccine, fine puts others risk. Hopefully they're made social pariahs rest us get lives. vulnerable vaccinated now. arent, thats them. Young people obviously scared long covid worry restrict freedom? get it, thats them. risk mutation country around half population vaccinated extremely low especially compared countries Asia. 

People love moving goalposts away, fact, need get vaccinated live normal life again. People, get vaccine know risk taking.  new mutations discovered every weeks, many scientists predict Covid continue circulating around world least next two three years, requiring nations reinstitute public health measures ad hoc basis foreseeable future. 

This going happen. mean, medically will, politically won't. People world willing lock ""save"" anti-vaxxers help themselves. still mostly PR get exception various reasons. I'm fully vaccinated, tested positive covid 3 days ago. Relatively mild symptoms, able smell pretty annoying. say totally over, still think vaccinated people try live normally.   used model study different interventions aim reducing size infection clusters, situations clusters would large. found interventions based acting symptomatic students receive positive test, standard practice many jurisdictions, ineffective preventing infections, instead found frequent screening entire class able reduce size clusters substantially.

Has nothing long covid.

You left word ""serious"" ""complications"". Serious complications = hospitalization death. relation long covid, considered serious complication rather chronic illness chronic health problems. 

And left part applicable young children, mostly age **5.** 

**Not misrepresent CDC said (which also know outdated anyway constantly updated changing), entirely left section long covid, completely different area.**

Additional complications associated COVID-19 include:

Lets hope figure something out, like maybe effective booster population. worst part AZ actually offers better protection beta even Pfizer. used single poorly conducted study make decision led thousands unnecessary deaths ""contained China"" Actually, though, that's also reason can't trigger happy lockdowns merely use rising cases cause try enforce them. Extended lockdowns also hurt ability country stay functional, mostly vaccinated countery going cause sorts severe internal tensions. third one earlier year barely tolerated.

You're splitting hairs two words synonyms other.

**Authorized**

*adjective: authorized*

having official permission approval.

""an authorized dealer""

Approx 15 per 100k car accidents. 7 per 100k covid. narrow men car accident rate would higher. Unless that's followed unrestricted life, yes, essentially value. bet soooooo great protected wasting away home everything closed endless cycle shit. least I'll allowed go supermarket since I'm vaccinated (the unvaccinated allowed seems, serious proposition I'm from), oh joy! I‚Äôve trying put thought words ages ! couldn‚Äôt pinpoint exactly driving crazy. Yeah, they‚Äôre talking less time detectable levels, time symptoms. Although you‚Äôd think time symptoms would lower.  think greatly misunderstand things work.

Just someone saved someone else‚Äôs life, it‚Äôs excuse remain unvaccinated. could well carrying virus result someone‚Äôs death. would say then?

And people want, that‚Äôs correct. don‚Äôt forget works ways. means people want, too, people currently something make life safer let selfish people interfere make harder everyone. spent last three months NL work Covid policies NL insane me.

Upon arrival April, everything closed except groceries make appointment go Hema buy dishes. thought bit overkill. However, wear mask work (large company, mixed office shop work) literally vaccinated person building 200+ (I'm American got Moderna late May). thought work without mask even go store mask allowed pretty crazy too; half US office already vaccinated point still mask requirement enter building. 

I go Keukenhof outside garden without getting negative rapid test, weeks later, packed Madurodam without mask test anything. rapid change policy real change vaccination even really infection rates. day left, could eat inside sit-down restaurant without mask infection rates going beyond arrived take-out situation two months prior.

It seemed vaccine situation basically changed 90 days there. vaccinated person work guy travelled US division gotten vaccinated there. vaccine schedule website said early June 40-50 age group mid-June 20-40 age groups without anyone knew age groups invited schedule appointment even early July. guess recently say 18+ get Janssen vaccine, they're covering 30+years age group once, curious that's working out. 

I understand country half population California produces vaccine locally awful job rolling vaccine stellar job offering free testing easy access nation-wide.  appreciate responses would love get insight, please help understand arguments. Regarding said, response... 
1. said SARS-CoV-2 novel. First sentence earlier comment.

2. never said anything scientists creating new virus. want confuse lab-made lab-leaked.

3. Everything written original point dismiss lab-leak hypothesis. Lab-leaks/accidents happened around world (US, UK, Venezuela, USSR, China, etc.). happened before, certainly happen again. Therefore, dismiss hypothesis evidence disproves it. 
Accidents happen, including strains like SARS-CoV-1. SARS-CoV-2 exposure events USA come lab mixups spillages. happened pandemic started, still, point accidents happen. 
Here's pandemic triggered lab-leak...

The Reemergent 1977 H1N1 Strain Gain-of-Function Debate (article 2015): article talks gain-of-function research Russia 1977 H1N1 flu outbreak came strain seen 20+ years. 1977 outbreak killed 700,000 people worldwide (mostly age 25 younger), despite mostly mild. came strain seen wild since 1957. younger ages could indicate older people previously exposed therefore immunity.

And here's article non-profit regarding several lab-leaks (some bacterial, viral): trying point happened before, therefore, possibility. dismiss lab-leak hypothesis evidence (which admit may never find). one EU UK something, too. seem Malta accept visitors minister said Malta recognised vaccination certificates issued European Union Britain. course Miami opened compared NYC. issue Florida people died didn‚Äôt need don‚Äôt see accomplishment. 4th absolute number deaths New Jersey, New York Texas isn‚Äôt something proud allowing happen. big increase cases slight increase severe cases good thing right? herd immunity relative low cost Yep. work home still (local government), I‚Äôm mask.  study occurred emergence Lambda variants? enough you? understand?  Yes, changed rules week later ppl received vaccination QR code got keep it. like applying job Subway putting resume, 'I bread. believe it."" waiting day COVID extinct; day almost certainly never coming. either get vaccinated accept low risk getting infected incredibly small risk turning serious one risks daily life stay isolated forever. choice. want involved shutting society experiment get choice. 

Calling 'experiment' seems common attack anything person making point like. truth whole pandemic massive unknown. There's risks every decision none decision. There's risks opening risks it. unknown outcomes. Ooooooof. Also young fully vaccinated; sorry you‚Äôre stuck dealing entirely predictable consequence dumb government actions. I‚Äôve anxious we‚Äôve going bit quick well luckily didn‚Äôt do‚Ä¶ that, jeez. Hope friends recover well stay safe.  I‚Äôm nurse NJ March-April last year TERRIFIED put child daycare nanny quit us fear. daycare first responders, even scarier, considering parents taking care Covid patients. interestingly kids getting sick! Now, I‚Äôm curious know son antibodies! Either really dumb, planned happen. know one worse    housekeeper nursing home tested TB every 6 months. ‚ÄúMost laws unjustified.‚Äù sure that. It‚Äôs opinion, right?

These people ultimately forced. article says it‚Äôs condition remain employed. Failing adhere rule result termination.

That‚Äôs society you. may choose live society‚Äôs greater good, it‚Äôs society‚Äôs responsibility accept so. Yes, 2 1/2 weeks radiation left. Still severely anemic &amp; white blood cell count low. mom begging help thru treatment &amp; finally let take daily radiation half week husband go back work &amp; found yesterday covid exposure church (singing, masks) &amp; fight make get tested &amp; kind freaking radiation occur body part once. get careful since covid started, I'll postpone/quit radiation &amp; less chance work. kind bull going here. Even people claim take seriously making easy mistakes basic science &amp; plenty news coverage say wrong right now. $, would move heartbeat... Maybe skip foreplay, call cops cause I'm extremist? :D But, CDC sez don‚Äôt need masks vaccinated. Exaggerate much?    true. negative test 40 hours. guess happened. people got sick hours brought club. club town Enschede 200 infections 800 visitors. even heard stories clubs letting people without evidence covid. Stupidity!!!! cant even... kids cohorted, make modifications increased ventilation systems (many schools spent lot money area), increased outdoor time, room follow 6 ft protocols desks, health check policy good? say, parents may conscientious area keep kids home illness symptoms. many possible protocol layers add decent effectiveness, necessarily option school districts. Masking thing. schools might thing that's feasible. know that's prevailing hypothesis, least, makes sense me! negative test entering

that's here. enter clubs minute received shot.

But that's kind dumb... Yes innocent question. tell ""just wondering"" rhetorical flourish. They're equivalent things, like asking blue sweater beige one, preferring Manchester United Manchester City. One definitely revealing cultish beliefs. little üî•, still good still good  Dutchy blame government this. misread Delta variant made dumb decisions time much uncertainty. pay price. Ill fully protected 6 weeks try careful before.

Dumb dumb dumb prioritizing 1st world countries vaccination good idea. We're NY metro area, too! :) Yeah, know healthcare workers don‚Äôt grow trees u can‚Äôt fire everyone. Maybe healthcare workers paid would want follow rules place lot closely. People able go clubs without shots, negative test entering. Also people able enter clubs minute received shot. Stupidity around...  traveling Italy last week basically indoor areas dozens people wear masks properly even all. mean care less since I'm vaxxed, kind weird considering one harshest lockdowns Europe anyone enforcing rules really. 7 July UK reported 30,000 new daily cases first time since January 40% rises hospital admissions deaths. 

I love use total number describe cases % increase describe deaths. wonder they're trying hide something???

Yes, are. Deaths went 20 30. Last time many cases deaths closer 500. Interesting. I‚Äôve nurse nearly 10 years haven‚Äôt mandated get single vaccine, I‚Äôve sign declination form. Yikes. üëçüèº literally people's first hand experience vaccine lol. ashamed poorly executed joke.  someone explain new varriants starting pop now? 1 year nothing new? pop like mushrooms. started UK im right? delta one, lamba, epsilon. now? changed much past 8 months so? Yes. COVID vaccines currently emergency authorization awaiting approval. given large amount data available showing efficacy safety, almost guaranteed full approval. 

Here's [opinion physician NYT felt helpful read. (Paywall bypass go Tor private browsing). 

Just one quote it: ‚ÄúFew biologics (vaccines, antibodies, molecules) safety efficacy scrutinized degree... mRNA vaccines overwhelmingly proved safe effective clinical trials, independent research experience millions people around world received them‚Äù. think people getting false impression Delta less severe best data coming UK. vaccination rate high there, big increases case counts accompanied big increases hospitalization death. 

That may give people impression Delta milder. UK reporting risk hospitalization nearly double Delta compared Alpha, multiplier 1.9 think. 

Fully vaccinated people drastically reduced risk hospitalization compared un-vaccinated people, large fraction UK population vaccinated. vaccinated unvaccinated 1.9 multiplier applied risk (compared Alpha). So, people able go clubs one shot? ridiculous. Switzerland, opened clubs weeks ago, people got two shots + waiting time, tested right entering club. come country used socialist. Best among us manage escape capitalism. Maybe perfect best thing world has. Exactly. now, I've gotten four tests done following order (while experiencing zero symptoms):

07/05/21 - Rapid Test (Negative)

07/06/21 - PCR (Positive)

07/07/21 - Rapid Test (Negative)

07/08/21 - PCR (Positive)

07/09/21 - Rapid Test (TBD)

Unsure much longer virus going lingering body per phone call Nevada Department Health, I've passed 10 days isolation (since first day experiencing symptoms), good function back normal. Indeed. Ive vaccinated since March still wear mask busy places work part. Outside mask. Anyone else this? johnson johnson still need one? people like one anymore? Pfizer, still vaccination choice even adventure. Sorry friend, agree you.

It like every countries leaders see two modes, fully open locked down. many measures work used between.

My state, New York made one decision shows ready backtrack. allowing restaurants keep outdoor dining areas year. clearly case pull back indoor dining. never tested. tested gave blood showed reactive vaccine. seven day average new cases looks low it‚Äôs Colorado since last summer. ‚ÄúSurging‚Äù alright‚Ä¶

I‚Äôve noticed fear mongering moved deaths cases percentage cases Delta. remember song dance used UK variant months back. ‚Äúsurges‚Äù even though cases aren‚Äôt even going necessarily. weird. never hear anymore bad NJ, PA, NY, etc. almost like took vaccine really worry anymore. also pass stupid antimask mandates either.  might well fire 95% healthcare workers. work two hospitals practically one masks nurses station anymore even though it‚Äôs mandated. northeast area 70+% vaccination rates. imagine it‚Äôs worse Midwest south Jewed verb definitely offensive, different noun.

Your ‚Äúthat Jew took money‚Äù example could said ethnicity.

That Mexican this, Italian that. say something negative inflection, anything ‚Äúslur.‚Äù

It‚Äôs definitely way offensive assume calling someone Jew insult, shows person‚Äôs negative bias. end, still customer. Capitalism sucks, get choice healthy aware enough make call time. death's door, care take you. go speaking every tribe, definitely shared consensus.  Yah right. Next saying seat belts keep face smashing dashboard. OP said he‚Äôs ready live life he‚Äôs done covid doesn‚Äôt care anti-vaxxers die. I‚Äôm sure celebrate anti-vaxxers dying differently old people last 2 years cause they‚Äôre me. Still people. shows reddit hive mind thinks people agree deserve live. means FIFA takes it. next Olympic hosts actually suited hosting mass events. 

Can't say World Cup Stop making life difficult healthcare workers. shot outside protocol, outside FDA guidance, mean additional paperwork. what? booster needed, come consensus say so. meantime, getting fully immunized super helpful. 

There ways check, perfect admit, patient willingly forcing medical errors healthcare affects us deeply. Healthcare workers protected work outside rules. even mentioning guilt feel something goes bad. ""correlation causation"", let's get carried away here

/s Hence need mask mean buy dry ice grocery stores. Doesnt seem hard. cant socialize meet people everyone waering masks. hermet what? roll dice long snake eyes lands.  ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è We've seen across states Australia, one first states ""open up"" first hit ~6 months later.

Unless actually mean actual indians dont think do.

Stop calling native Americans ""Indians"" unvaccinated continue breed variants requiring new boosters. username could fitting states developing online verification system prevent fakes. It'll take awhile, hope they'll permanently ban idiots entering ever get caught. J&amp;J still 1 shot vaccine, right? hate needles apparently mRNA vaccines near moment. Every food injest plays part gut biome‚Ä¶why investigate diet instead? Also yeast infections typically cause poor hygiene.  I‚Äôm vaccinated. I‚Äôm spreading shit. feel sick I‚Äôll isolate.

vaccinated people resistant COVID evolutionary advantage COVID mutate bypass vaccine resistance boom new variant becomes prevalent even vaccinated population resistant it?

Ok high school biology background. Wishing lived anywhere missouri right places didn‚Äôt close beach all, given sharks kill old people stuff. like 12 them? sure vaccines Pfizer kept cold needed random places giving shots? seems hard imagine small walgreens, cvs, riteaids etc., able consistently? ‚ÄúVaccines? Indian reservations.‚Äù can't imagine store without mask on. better nothing, effective Pfizer, Moderna, Oxford J&amp;J. can't get anything else, take it. comment makes zero sense. someone side effects vaccine means either weak immune system, older, body didn‚Äôt make antibodies shot (this happens people getting certain vaccines). COVID previously ones get severe vaccine side effects. super spreader would sick AF vaccine. gets said lot, ACTUAL Indian Americans? Like know, fucking country? Wut What? Calling people black racist... Wtf?

Are offended someone says white? Fellow American Indian here. Frankly really bother someone addresses Indian. perfectly honest I've always kinda felt indifferent term 'native American' actually.. grown me. Right FDA CDC say science yet pointing direction needing booster likely protection, though unclear effective variants could different infected by. Additionally, research shows getting vaccinated improves immunity natural immunity alone. drink enough Clorox. Indian Americans. one says American Asian. Thanks laugh haha. I‚Äôm 23 getting second dose Monday Stay away her. I'm saying know firsthand. presume judge them, friends co-workers prefer called. 

I call Black people 'Black' even though racist idiotic sounding me. That's want, I'm going argue.  Okay emails lost, far long.

However, able find portion NAVADMIN 327/20 EUA, commands ensure 100 percent personnel 
are offered vaccine vaccine available. Vaccination remains 
voluntary EUA. Commands considered complete 
personnel recorded MRRS either vaccinated declining vaccine licensed, vaccine may required.
If vaccine becomes required, commands considered complete 
90 percent personnel recorded MRRS either vaccinated 
or received exemption vaccine. Nationally isn‚Äôt picture here. Look Arkansas Missouri. Texas headed direction unvaccinated multitudes. found video really informative this! know Dallas completely overwhelmed number much high. even Wuhan 50% population infected. Indian-American rather American-Indian.

Look way. I'm Jewish. never chose term really refer Jews. name used slur much label. I'm Yehudi Yid myriad terms USA English speaking world Jew works fine. watch context cool. 

I understand wanting control identity. Americans Indians want called American Indians? Fine. find term 'Black' demeaning racist. But, that's they'd like called argue? research make informed decision. However, need disclose vaccination status family. That's business, theirs.

The vaccines usually symptom-free mild cause problems except extremely rare instances, shown effective. hand, COVID -- well cause problems.

Incidentally, reason prefer J&amp;J Moderna Pfizer? mRNA seems effective variants. So... Instead name white man gave them, chose name white man gave them.


That's solid sound like idiot call Native American First Nation USA.

... tribes/people within think Indian stupid term sound idiotic, got it. Good know speak self-hatred. make lot sense means majority people (who mostly idiots) opposite. Immigration officer here. Test vaccination documents aren‚Äôt standardized don‚Äôt anti counterfeiting measures them. Making next useless international travel. travelers wanted keep going ones downloading fake certifications offline. 

Computerized schemas would great generally take years (or decades) get agreement on. TIL impossible Pfizer Moderna testing third dose existing vaccines must merit.

edit: Fauci Gottlieb also considered 3rd dose Whoosh. That‚Äôs pretty dang terrifying. Meanwhile sh1t state, governor told feds didn‚Äôt want covid assistance wasn‚Äôt welcomed here. God hate Midwest. nonsense needs stop. presume they're holding work booster that's effective Indian/Delta variety. People keep saying masks big deal hate seeing people's faces hate foggy glasses restricted breathing.

I'm vaccinated! supposed end. really hope start wearing again. Indeed, thought went without saying tbh. Yeah, screw disabled high risk folks might able get vaccines greater risk part. 

So edgy, brave.  Covid deadly, dude.

Even efforts put last 18 months fight pandemic, 1 ~500 Americans dead. understand that. city first death delta variant fully vaccinated 40 year old, although noted several underlying conditions, knows going on.  Indigenous people prefer called Indians rather Native Americans.  prefer make choice rather 'The White Man' give yet another label thankyouvery much. 

Indian, American Indian, tribe accepted. sound like idiot call Native American First Nation USA. ask tribe nation belong like lumped name choose. Fake crowd noise driving crazy. ""at will"" employment state, employer require anything want long protected class, fire refusing comply. Vaccination hesitation protected class. called black ‚Äúwrong‚Äù skin color??

Maybe black negative connotation mind, that‚Äôs problem.  FDA approval ""necessary"" doctors recommend patients. much stopping someone getting third dose, unless pharmacy insurance company really ball. keyword tourists? many jobs require international travel workers going world unvaccinated. never heard Jew used slur? 

Those Jews moving in, ruining neighborhood. 

Jews running Hollywood banks.

Bunch Jews starting another war.

Rich Jews ripping us again. 

Don't jew bro! They've pretty similar recently. World Cup 2014 Brazil, Olympics 2016 Rio. World Cup 2018 Russia, Olympics 2018 Sochi. need 70% immunity virus can't spread first place

It's actually probably closer 80-90% Delta's R0. Alll European Union countries electronically verifiable vaccine documents verification systems could implemented two hours. It‚Äôs QR code link verification system also includes name, DOB vaccination information. absolutely standardized. Absurdly rare. Covid much real threat. don‚Äôt get vaccinated, almost certainly inevitably get covid. Even gotten covid already, Delta variant (the dominate strain US) reinfect you. know, existing vaccines still protect Delta variant. 2/3rd adults ‚Äúatrocious‚Äù now? Lmao. long language accepted enough people become normal without ‚Äúright‚Äù Right now, Pfizer saying want FDA authorize existing vaccine third dose . . . FDA buying (right now). 

If decide authorize third dose, likely they'll recommend at-risk patients. accepted term 'Black' make less racist. makes acceptable racism still racist. literally referring large group people racial characteristic. textbook racism?  over-preparing well. get (as extreme example) variant that's suddenly far effective evading immunity, constantly updated booster candidates puts us better position. bullshit. one gives enough shit ask who‚Äôs vaccinated, businesses want money people want chill friends again. sing verse 18-24 year olds getting vaccinated much higher rates olds? one said learn much...   Based what? arbiter? think physically disabled man like would empathy. Apparently he's mentally disabled too. top Native American online news source named Indian Country Today: Shoot daddy guy can‚Äôt serious calling Jew black slurs. 

He seem american, he‚Äôs commenting American culture knows anything it. Yep, one shot. analyze word 'black'

You're referring someone based solely skin color. skin color that's wrong mind you. No-one black. racist? demeaning wrong? 

Yes, use term Jew time. Secular Jews know nothing else. Move religious Israeli Jews term used nearly much. Israelis call Yehudim Yisraelim, Orthodox Jews call Yiddin generally. Jew fine pedestrian. much less used formal situations.  alone. Hang there. sucks. did, getting tested access turned complete shitshow. dude's moron. Canada 46% eligible population double vaccinated, increasing 1.25 percentage points per day. thing. hometown Oklahoma [Seneca Indian close 1980.  reckon Vietnam UK comparable. one get pretty cold winters wonders increasing prevalence respiratory disease. Maaaaan enough!? people arent going get vaccinated!! Im talking ones refuse btw lol covered, not....why still punished others arent taking serious? I'll wear mine kids cant get vaxxed yet, point need take shackles  Jews definitely refer Jews America. certainly slur. Please continue train thought, I‚Äôd love hear anecdotal reports didn‚Äôt Covid first jab typically isn‚Äôt bad, it‚Äôs 2nd one.  know tragedy. I'm responding specifically comment saying companies lose vast swaths blue-collar workforce.

""Not deadly"" mean ""not deadly"" means ""not deadly specific person I'm replying believes."" would shocked recommended get vaccine theoretical third dose. Based data we've seen mixing vaccines, getting different vaccine makes sense. W trump admin really helped tribes procure vaccines Biden‚Äôs admin continued that. I‚Äôm high admin healthcare reservation saw support admins throughout.  title makes seem like vaccine distribution favoring inmates staff, staff freedom get vaccinated want to. Africa vast varied. repeatedly referred terms individual countries? Basically one reasons government cancel olympics IOC forcing go through, else pay economy crippling fines. tribe location dependent. link scientific paper study (i.e. evidence) says that? Wait, Indians Native Americans? think point can't keep restrictions forever  wonder factors feed other.

Vaccine skepticism might likely take hold among population already good access (and longstanding relationship) primary care provider. Without someone already know trust encouraging get vaccinated, addressing skepticism, members already marginalized groups might receptive conspiracy theories.

So something like Indian Health Service would already put ground work trusted voices public health issues long covid ever happened, way might true poorer black (or Latino even white) communities. dependent tribe location. this? ~50% adults Canada fully vaccinated now, we're vaccinating nearly 2% population day, number close 70% 10 days.

We've delivered doses per capita US has.

I know specifics NY, I'd expect Ontario passing guys second doses shortly, already passed first doses. White guy here, vaccinated Chickasaw. know disease fuck around. Florida would probably demand non-vaccinated athletes allowed compete. Oops, probably walked 2 miles home vaccination tropical sun then. Hell I'm Northeast still masking indoors. help Upstate NY effectively Trump Country though. June made agreements send 80 million vaccines developing countries. least 40 million shipped end June rest done coming weeks.

These doses offered Caribbean countries well African nations.

We can't save everyone once, we're sending vaccines now. Donating them, actually, selling unlike countries. Hmm, can‚Äôt require masks, post signs saying charge customers twice much don‚Äôt mask? also 900 cases 125 million people. US 20 times many cases less 4 times population. state 4 million dropped mask mandate 500 new cases day. good place see reaction much different low numbers?  high rates vaccination. high rates partial vaccination uneven vaccination (e.g. 50/50 vaxxed/unvaxxed) forward transmission vaccinated unvaccinated. get 80-90% fully vaccinated range, need suppress spread context likely breed vaccine-resistant mutation. director Centre Genomic Research University Liverpool said day, ‚Äú letting virus rip partially vaccinated population exactly experiment I‚Äôd evolve virus able evade immunity.‚Äù 'use critical thinking' another blend 'I'm right, wrong' anymore.

If actually applied critical thinking realize nonsensical arguments been.

If genuinely think favorable call someone colored rather black, pretty obvious indication far detached reality atm. want make argument known proper vernacular (not pejorative vernacular) racist, valid argument, waaaaaay detached conversation. 

And think implying that, again, misappropriated said, 'critical thinking'.

Brave, indeed. 3 seconds googling would tell you‚Äôre wrong. 60% residents NY least first shot. Almost 70% Canadians theirs. Good try though! Mine might see sibling he's upset lack care others.

They antivax before, avoided flu season things like measles outbreak, pandemic last straw him. Said it‚Äôs almost impossible get fully vaccinated Canada right now.

He's full shit. Every single person older 12 eligible shots Saskatchewan we're country's backwater. He's willing make multiple calls pharmacies provincial vaccination sites. hard right Ontario. Maybe signed provincial waitlist bother looking resources like pharmacies.  Source? Can‚Äôt seem find anything saying private business can‚Äôt require mask. Uptake percentage single digits. enough ways trying kill off, need Covid lackluster health care get, experience US didn‚Äôt help. People want get vaccinated get vaccinated soon can. Work hours family isn‚Äôt holding people back. started wearing n95s able buy them, give headache.

I wear one, kiddo might high risk, know immunocompromised live amongst us, data vaccinated transmission still place. 

But look forward day ditch mask except sick worst flu season like used do. Sunk cost quite right, since would actually lose money scrapped Olympics point. avoiding monetary loss continuing. yet still much faster vast majority countries. bad country domestic production capacity vaccines. Military yeah, maybe government officials too. meant precedent mandating everyone. Right little garage?  ones usually crowds, like basketball, swimming, etc. competing front crowds (until recently) year, plenty time adjust always thought Canadian term ""First Nations"" respectful descriptive. sound like much friend. state Emergency two months ago added another prevent outbreak Olympics. reality we've strict restrictions throughout year.  120 people Maryland died covid last month. 120 vaccinated. Lol ‚ÄúAmerican Indian‚Äù isn‚Äôt term white people came with. Question: know infections among fully vaccinated people rare possible, know people getting unvaccinated people? data likely spread fully vaccinated person another vaccinated person?  really care get it, choice. care potentially putting others household risk.   It‚Äôs rather logical. Yes, specific studies this, exposure better immune system generally speaking. Good. Dumb people usually learn lessons it‚Äôs late. also remember stories blankets    That‚Äôs term seems common Canada (alongside Aboriginal also includes Inuit (‚ÄúEskimos‚Äù) M√©tis.) Well solve this?  Wait till people figure strains also created vaccinated breakthrough infections, strains adapt vaccines.

Unfortunately much done this. 3rd boost technically cause even aggressive side effects 2nd? curious People tend think catholics one monolithic entity. might look way first catholics _very_ different depending country. progressive conservative ones, tolerant intolerant catholics. Even Europe differences huge, catholics southern Italy may think differently Ireland, may even different festivals traditions. 

And naturally way see science may different well. may open others. empathetic Da. Ok, link overall covid page nothing support statement. CDC currently preparing booster shots. Point is, anyone trying say covid over, Forever flat wrong. don‚Äôt know enough. 

‚ÄúThe U.S. government planning potential need Covid-19 vaccine booster shots ""just case,"" CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky told CNBC Healthy Returns Summit Tuesday.

Drugmakers scientists say people likely need booster shot Covid-19 vaccines possibly additional shots year, like seasonal flu.

Pfizer, Moderna Johnson &amp; Johnson said developing booster shots next-generation versions vaccines bolster protection.‚Äù

""What we're talking thinking ahead,"" said interview CNBC's Meg Tirrell. ""What happens year 18 months immunity wanes? That's really job hope best plan might happen need boosters future, way get flu vaccine boosters every year.""

‚ÄúLast month, Biden administration's Covid response chief science officer, David Kessler, said Americans expect receive booster shots protect coronavirus variants. told U.S. lawmakers currently authorized vaccines highly protective noted new variants could ""challenge"" effectiveness would realistically say best, 70% 70% would willing take third dose.

The messaging focused around getting two doses, even though always toyed fact third might needed, need change marketing strategy say: ‚ÄùOh you‚Äôre fully vaccinated? Yeah nah lol you‚Äôre actually need third nvm‚Äù

I‚Äôm going guess say third boost pushes slow tedious. let‚Äôs get 2nd doses cleared first start talking 3rd 4th lmao   dude, could describing town Oklahoma, they‚Äôre baptist Methodist here. heart goes you. think moderna considered slightly effective pfizer general. sure means regards variant though, sorry  claiming triage US states anywhere? has, Canada. describe Indigenous people. 600 First Nations Canada, First Nations include Inuit M√©tis people. Indigenous works fine Canada include everyone, I'm sure people would happy US. I'm due 2nd Pfizer dose week's time. wondering reschedule get moderna instead Arkanspread unlike original shots

I'll respectfully disagree here. cash injection govt, Moderna losing hundreds millions year since Since inception, incurred significant net losses. June 30, 2020, accumulated deficit $1.74 billion

The cash injection US govt [over $2 all, U.S. agencies committed $2.5 billion help develop Moderna‚Äôs vaccine buy doses

This alone put back ""profit"".

This raises questions motivation companies involved covid-19, ""[a wave 40 new billionaires made ten-figure fortunes companies involved battle reason 750 deaths among 160 million vaccinations SPREAD lessened period time due vaccination. prime saving grace lessening spread less infectious variant. That's vaccine primarily does. secondary effect, individual improving immune response resulting asymptomatic presentation, reduced hospitalization death. 160 million people exposed covid last months. Millions though, vaccination rates low. see limitations secondary benefit, numbers harder shrug at.

Once places well throws another wave, absolutely will, find deaths significant number.

Whether think good public health anything you.  Modern media, social traditional, also far stronger form propaganda think people realize. Especially news media anything presents ""reporting facts"".

In experience, people least usually distinguish fiction reality bit better fiction obvious disconnect, presented fiction. allows less suspension disbelief used watching say, movie fictional story. might still believe something false (like, sound space hear space movies), usually drop belief pretty presented facts.

But effect decreses media presents ""real"". People believe fictionary story home town believe sci-fi story. believe documentary believe movie home town. believe chosen news source believe documentary (especially conforms already existing beliefs challenge them). believe Trump rally believe see him. despite fact accounts equally fictitious false. trained respond media way.

The way actually counter teach people naturally skeptical, question everything, think critically. teach discern false information TOP that. honest, easy. skill develops time. constantly guard aware idea someone try trick false information learn fact-check everything. People spread disinformation also deliberately confuse facts takes time (and effort) disprove claims, therefor people less likely time energy it.

All result combination traditional media propaganda smartphone age. never dealt history, we're starting understand effects it. Giving people phones without helping people learn use responsibly may thing destroys us end. reach people one time help learn skills. grandparents ones greater risk. yes risk still exists young little humans, really would worry toddlers get covid asymptomatically drool grandma grandpa something boom might get sick toddlers showed zero symptoms. Maybe. risk still obviously toddlers too. explain Kent variant dangerous COVID mutation 2020? Kent third world country opinion? I'd like see data Israel places start getting extreme talking boosters.

I think odd seen rise reinfections folks infected last year natural immunity presumably lower levels antibodies point. we're seeing vaccinated immunity wane 6 months. 

I need data available make make sense. Nope extremely wrong It‚Äôs Canadian term. Even US, people use ‚ÄúFirst Nations‚Äù refer Indigenous peoples Canada Inuit M√©tis. It‚Äôs even necessarily fear they‚Äôd win. Litigation expensive even get W.

EDIT: Meaning universities. doubt military cares much kind cost. See? guy gets it.   Everyone keeps mentioning unvaccinated kids, significance that? potentially get sick COVID, going harbors transmitting disease? thought kids exceptionally strong immune systems need worry? genuine questions have. Comparing flu, also endemic dangerous, isn‚Äôt allowed brings sense familiarity concept leads little bit comfort‚Ä¶. That‚Äôs forbidden. 

The obsessing people product articles like this. divide America.. ever notice lagging vaccination rates cities often go unreported certainly complained ? Everyone get vaccine. Dr. Eric Topol, professor molecular medicine director Scripps Research Translational Institute La Jolla, California, said basing decision waning antibody protection ignores role important parts immune response, including memory B cells, make antibodies demand challenged virus.

Thought important thing remember. long risk significantly lower infected vaccinated person transmit virus, memory cells protective.

Israel said earlier week that¬†the shot protected 64% inoculated people infection outbreak Delta variant, 94% before.
The vaccine still provided 94% protection severe illness outbreak, compared 97% before, health ministry said.

This makes sense Israel started efficient campaign December. read article? So, grandparents refuse get vaccinated around toddler children, greater risk? Let‚Äôs honest though, western world there‚Äôs really nothing it. least US (I think true Western Europe well), everyone eligible vaccine able get one while. We‚Äôre close vaccination ceiling.

Even presently we‚Äôre dealing ongoing case landslide prefecture that‚Äôll host bicycle stuff. weather forecast says we‚Äôll heavy rain next week likely causes landslide flooding Western Japan - unfortunate weather-disaster combo repeated last several years.

Here‚Äôs example: Nigerian man moves US. point, never referred Black. simply African, bis ethnic cultural identity. here, he‚Äôs lumped existing ethnic group simply due color skin. 

The whole shit elaborate scam human existence. Blame Bible, source evil world, Noah. body response much stronger since already antibodies vaccine. Pan-flu probably gonna happen though. far understand, flu mutates much fast due ability swap entire chunks RNA strains.

What *might* happen mRNA technology may able wait start flu season see strain becoming dominant *then* start mass producing vaccines, instead trying guess 8 months advance like currently to. Yeah it‚Äôs long term effects described issue Little bit background:
Clubs, bars large public events reopened massive societal pressure. conditions entry being:

- recent negative test result, or

- vaccinated

The caveat regular 14-days vaccination take full effect taken account. current spike infections caused two groups:

- people already covid, went quick Jansen vaccine (being one jab), heading bar straight after.

- people forged proof abovementioned entry requirements. Australian, actually thought life back normal US.

Unfortunately life normal us due slow vaccine rollout, close (unless unfortunate enough live Sydney).  vitro yeah agree general theory. However, I've seen nothing suggest amount anything significant. think legitimate concern tho hence prepared elderly immunocompromised now, I'm seeing precaution. I'm 100% gonna take word Moderna co-founder need boosters. I'd much rather let someone else ""independent"" tell me. worked great Netherlands  Probably intensive all.

Moderna posted [development took 2 days receiving genetic code SARS-CoV-2 creating vaccine formula. Within month, first batch vaccines ready used testing.

The biggest hurdle regulators. want quick rollout modified booster shot, current approval system adjusted something akin seasonal flu shot.   send beautiful congratulations cards wise decision.

What hell thinking. recently traveled across southwest 40. HAPPILY SHOCKED Gallup, New Mexico highest useage masks anywhere. honestly like San Diego first 2 months covid, despite 16th month covid (counting March 2020. know earlier that's measures started happening.) 

It clear influenced tribal populations. unmasked 50ish year old white people though occasionally there'd either someone hispanic American Indian wearing mask inside business.


It amazing unexpected. 93% protection hospitalization death. 
Regardless Vaccine taken. 

I treat Vaccine body armor. Even get pinged , likely get sore reminder still laugh next day. 

Rather rolling dice  Priorities discussed‚Ä¶ India meanwhile implementing super-expensive unnecessary projects like new government house described megalomania.  Canadian citizen permanent residence travel Canada, way last 18 months

That's inessential travel. Canada let's others essential travel, still approving manner visas. spacing first second dose 35 days. God, America stupid country. know getting J&amp;J, could go party. That's mess. Even vaccinated still spread around well.  happen? true. saving grace Johnson vaccine really worked favor deaths remain LOW 32000+ cases would preventable only.. oh well, country comment I'll leave brits comment further. things may want consider:

- number testings Tokyo small. last month, highest number testing per day 15000. weeks numbers hover 12000- 3000-ish. numbers likely include asymptomatic cases. 

- Japan many ICU beds per population developed countries do. According [this article last Japan 5 ICU beds per 100,000 people, US 35; Germany, 30; Italy, 12; Spain, 10. Even seemingly low number cases could lead collapse medical system, Japan extra careful. 

- Japan hasn‚Äôt good compared countries Asia. example, Japan (population 126 million) 14897 deaths, Vietnam (population 96 million) 100 deaths. Yes, actually agree confusing, way things communicated help all. addition, country comes different conclusions different measures applied, etc. mess.

What I'm saying, basically, surprising mess, situation complex. everybody (naturally) looking clear answers guidance therefore probably unavoidable institutions news sources provide apparently (and misleadingly) clear absolute answers. said like 6 weeks ago, I'd believed you, Canada enough doses go around. **only** thing Canada might make stateside appealing mandatory 7-8 week wait doses. Except example slew vaccines kids required get school. Well considerating history eastern sickness wiping populations‚Ä¶ got three doses pfizer lol march may june 8 weeks. I've gotten help Cherokee Chickasaw Nations American government wrong. Canadians can't get second dose four months. fail.

That's longer accurate. currently 8 weeks. yes, understand well-intentioned rationale provide added incentive people get vaccinated.

This optimistic way looking it. cynical (and, view, realistic, ymmv) view stats game. Nothing said going convince many people one way another. people going keep masking going keep masking, ones going get vaccinated get vaccinated, ones already gave pandemic bored going change behavior. convince 10 people waiting around good reason, consider ""win"", especially makes look little bit better average Joe wants understand wanting something make true.

Calling ""good intentioned"" bit generous. statistics, apathy, unwillingness forward looking. children start dropping like flies COVID, might kick ass parents need get kids vaccinated. shame resort children dying ventilators. Hmmm political party belong? always, suffering point Im understanding what's corrupt letting games continue I‚Äôll take business elsewhere duh They're saying immunity wane people got shot 6 months ago might need (if ever)  $$$$$$$$ Arizona, idiotic especially coupled extremely low vaccination rate. virus stayed around population yes. first vaccinations were/are effective, don‚Äôt use efficacy completely stamp virus population you‚Äôre doomed repeat flu cycle. sense, yes, always going end here, didn‚Äôt necessarily to.  Second dose killed yesterday/2 nights ago ...and private business requires customers use mask? wonder Moderna.  write good conscience? sick dying voters (and family of) ones driving this. ""top"" politician moment reflect views constituency. people super anti vaccine live imaginary world friends created.

I‚Äôm feeling nervous. first Pfizer fine. nervous?  It‚Äôll interesting see countries moved longer intervals see different results. regardless it‚Äôs encouraging see third dose vaccine boost immunity massively. easier wait newly developed shot. 1 - chancellor University Arkansas Medical Sciences. Gotta think ""sciencey stuff"" backing up.

2 - Patterson, used family example, even perfectly healthy vaccinated people carry virus asymptomatic minimally symptomatic COVID-19 goes state probability spreading virus grows higher transmittable delta variant play, especially 65 percent Arkansans still fully much higher percentage time young otherwise healthy individuals. odds going much rougher experience COVID-19 next several months experienced first 18 months pandemic. Well, perhaps *and Delta variant dominant*. wasn‚Äôt CDC made recommendation. 

We‚Äôre looking ~160 million undervaccinated unvaccinated people, iirc, ~44 million unvaccinated kids 12 Delta washes country. trying say that, clear, every region different blanket recommendation longer necessary parents let get even though old enough to.   concerning thing virus prevalent long-term symptoms are. thing keeps going around foreseeable future, going ton people basically disabled.   ‚Äútwo Americas,‚Äù said Dr. Paul Offit, pediatrician vaccine advocate served advisory panels Centers Disease Control Prevention Food Drug Administration. ‚ÄúThere vaccinated America unvaccinated America, think unvaccinated America pay price that.‚Äù Reminds black mirror episode   Um, is. said places outdoor dining set-ups established covid next year. thought guys figured they‚Äôre indian?? don‚Äôt hear anyone american articles still refer problem everyone that, kids unvaccinated fault won‚Äôt access medical care unless go drain ED resources something pediatrician handle. 

Rather punishing kid, doctor reporting families CPS since it‚Äôs form endangerment.   Maybe people weak immune system (like elderly) get booster. I‚Äôm expert covid policy think there‚Äôs reason lot European governments going direction. It‚Äôs really sustainable. thrash population bigger governments bill ‚Ä¶.

I really responding fact people think it‚Äôs upsetting covid came bank lockdown #3 . 4 ? 

My mountain town US defcon 1 last year we‚Äôre still kicking . Individual responsibility goes lot government rules lack Easy fix‚Ä¶ give everyone ivermectin, cheap available. None things contagious. COVID is.  Yes. say they're working updated one Delta, 3rd shot original would still increase neutralization quite bit.

Sinovac CEO based Phase 2 trial even West often small yield statistical Yes, provides massive boost neutralizing antibodies prevents infections. original doses given close together - 21 days enough maximize immune response. window ""convenience"" get trials done quickly. 

In US least, tons excess doses floating around. one could argue best thing would give countries need, think third dose reasonable offer option anyone elderly/high risk spend lot time around same. people knocking doors say ""here's vaccination locations literature vaccine"" become ""the federal government going force vaccine us""? legally possible interpretation constitution. government knock ask nicely. tell fuck right off.

It‚Äôs problem. feel bad immune-compromised people, shouldn‚Äôt anywhere near people this, masked not. Canada pretty big distaste that, ik first Nations use (including grandmother) acknowledge habit/just use, acceptable. also understand bit ridiculous due well... india answer. know lambda it‚Äôs worse known variant.

Northeast bros Thank you! thought article talking Indians living America. still get infected vaccinated. remember article read, third shot could increase immunity 5 10 fold, especially new variants coming Delta lambda. know  true. probably degree immunity years, maybe forever. wane time, first thing wane neutralizing antibodies stop getting infected first place.

The boosters would largely top off, likely take even higher originally, going winter months virus likely become prevalent spreads easier indoors. also cement t-cell cellular immunity (which long-lasting stuff reactive proactive like circulating antibodies) place strongly robustly course say normal.  know that, thanks. saw tonite Pfizer working Delta-specific booster, word schedule

Again, knows long take. reorted effectiveness 64% preventing infections symptomatic disease 64% compares 88% effectiveness delta variant second dose [as reported time effectiveness preventing severe disease remains reassuringly high 93%. dust settles final estimates probably fall somewhere inbetween.

That really said all. saying contagiousness increase delta variant overcoming seasonality **unvaccinated** population. mean breakdown pandemic phase Many tribes like term Indian though believe opinion matters well. Coming someone tutored reservation undergrad. Chile also Lamda variant death toll horrific  Isn‚Äôt vaccination card good enough? It‚Äôs currently sitting safe mainly reason... case need travel reason parts country need wear masks highly vaccinated. course..those sections country believe masks either.

And course states would need reintroduce mask social distance never even think that. news media insist masking fantasies never happen?

Like sudden anti vax/mask/social distance governors going change minds day now. Yeah sure, bet! day gonna right thing LOL! term ""American Indian"" least knowledge became new leading term 10 years ago. look comments here, indigenous americans comments say refer American Indian forget southeast exists. states even hit 33% vaccination yet extremely unlikely ever break 40% vaccines start wearing off. people get boosters extremely low number around also. Let eat cake die Considering fully vaccinated friend caught covid couple months later, I‚Äôd concerned. miserable days, made worse wondering he‚Äôd infected young family members idiot half family remain unvaccinated.

I sympathy family member ends hospitalized chose get vaccinated- doesn‚Äôt mean won‚Äôt take kids/pets/help spouse even though causes hardship. Unvaxxed people hurt families/communities themselves.

I‚Äôm nearly concerned unvaccinated, it‚Äôs still worry. job very, public expose 2-3,000 people per day myself. I‚Äôd rather give anybody covid. get myself, even would almost guaranteed mild. 2 shots, I'll even get 3rd shot.


If get 4th 5th. I'm lmfao. enough enough



I would assume everything lost point, im suffering ""side effects"" game cat mouse. Fuck Native here, grew reservation, American Indian Native American fine. Pfizer 1 2 moderna 3? I‚Äôm starting wonder mean ‚Äúfully vaccinated‚Äù. 

Tempting assume means shots Delta immunocompromised would logically mean adequate titers protective antibodies. Literally this. want know already. gonna blow soon?? Someone give definitive answer. law large numbers work. 

If effectiveness vaccine goes percentage points, say 98% 80%, given variant, make ineffective. also means among 100.000 vaccinated people get infected, get 20.000 people potentially need go hospital, rather 2.000. That's ten times much, even though effectiveness budged points. Scientists working RNA vaccines 30 years.

Kinda hard trust something like this. club bar‚Äôs interest check fully vaccinated/tested. don‚Äôt care, long get paying customers. 

It‚Äôs common knowledge people get screenshot fully vaccinated tested person‚Äôs QR code use enter. Officially ID check well, bars clubs don‚Äôt increase waiting times. 

More waiting times = less customers = less money financially difficult time. 

Also, another issue don‚Äôt wait full vaccination become effective. allowed entry everywhere long got second shot. saw people getting vaccinated Janssen morning, going clubs evening. Despite vaccine zero effectiveness. Thank god fixed this, wait two weeks. 

If wanted testing/vaccination entry work, made independent organisation verify entry QR codes. People without financial stake many people enter bar club. that, course, costs money. Apparently MRNA vaccines super easy change adapt different strains variants since done genetically cellular sequenced level.

Where been? Canadian citizen permanent residence travel Canada, way last 18 months I‚Äôm vaccinated sub amazes think spewing hateful vitriol verbally abusive literally wishing death vaccine hesitant people think afford political gain somehow convince hesitant attempting bully people submission good guys here. 40% actually Yes.

The needs many outweigh needs Seems like empathetic vs self-serving I'm glad sf bay area, extremely high vaccination rates. really hope bring back mask mandates comment telling wrong 100% right, eat shit  validate Christopher Columbus? think restrictions largely removed covid numbers low. Yeah ""First Nations"" means ""Canada.""  


Legally US, ""American Indian"" include Alaska peoples, ""Alaska Natives."" people realize term gets used broadly. ""Indigenous"" increasingly common officialdom, would include Native Hawai'ians, different cultural background. 

In case, whatever term people use, lumps together hundreds tribes nations sole property ""other"" colonial communities created nation-states U.S. Canada.  is. American Indian equally confusing sometimes lol Again, lot speculation, . . . 

In UK mix / match trial gave four different combinations: AZ/AZ, Pfizer/Pfizer, AZ/Pfizer, Pfizer/AZ. results, based antibody titers T-cell response, pretty clear anyone given first dose AZ would better protected second dose Pfizer - definitely surprising. 

The data received first dose Pfizer interesting. Getting second dose Pfizer improved antibody titers T-cell response, getting second dose AZ (after first dose Pfizer) increased antibody titers similarly t-cell response almost twice high receiving two Pfizer doses. Here's excerpt write-up Nature 

""In Com-COV study, highest antibody response people receiving standard two shots Pfizer‚ÄìBioNTech, response almost high combination Oxford‚ÄìAstraZeneca followed Pfizer‚ÄìBioNTech. combination also best T-cell response ‚Äî twice high two Pfizer‚ÄìBioNTech doses. Mixing mRNA vaccine adenovirus-based one could therefore provide ‚Äúthe best two worlds‚Äù, &lt;immunologist Leif Erik Sander Charit√© University Hospital explains.""

Adenovirus vector vaccines AZ J&amp;J known provide strong T-cell response that's key long-term immunity. Using adenovirus vector vaccine J&amp;J makes sense ""booster"" two Pfizer vaccines - certainly receiving third Pfizer dose. 

I'm saying answer, data right - know adenovirus vector vaccines strong t-cell response - that's I'd put money right (with choices US). go Asia nuanced approach. Germany also still requiring masks public transport etc though restrictions gone‚Äîbut gone numbers really low moment. numbers go certain thresholds restrictions automatically apply. Personally want huge Covid surge Autumn/Winter‚Äîthough sort surge inevitable. High five Pacific Northwest. Sorry southerners‚Ä¶ people won‚Äôt wear them

So people LIKELY INFECTED won‚Äôt wear like term sense making clean break terminologically, also emphasizing political nature tribes. ""Native American"" treated like ethnicity, never was. 530 tribes US, nearly one ethnicity.  


That said, sounds funny use First Nations us, term means Canadian tribes. That's part it, also access vaccines sooner others. able get vaccinated nurses know. I'm healthy 20 year old. got first dose February *Freezes burns death simultaneously Texas* pretty neat since told nurses giving shots first EMT 9 counties actually volunteer receive it. choctaw nice know native tribes taking covid seriously.  Honestly really big debate comes individual person fine with. use native popular grew (and get confused type Indian we're talking about) grandparents choose Indian. that's fine. say redskin injun lol. know someone's tribe always use instead aren‚Äôt First Nation though. never one nation many fractured tribes empire even first. first would whatever nation setup came across land bridge Asian even it‚Äôs doubtful one monolithic group would dozens hundreds small tribes came across time. 

So there‚Äôs way know specific tribes descendants actual first tribe come America. happened last month :

""In broad ruling reaffirming the¬†sovereignty¬†of¬†Native American¬†tribes, U.S.¬†Supreme Court¬†declared unanimously Tuesday that¬†tribal¬†police officers power temporarily detain search non-Native Americans on¬†tribal¬†land they're suspected violating state federal law.""

Progress, albeit painfully slow. think confusion ""Indian,"" since Indian-Americans prone, like X-American groups call ""X."" Hence ""I'm Irish!"" people whose family back Ireland three generations, ""I'm 3/4 German"" etc... tribes call Indians literally word Indian name tribe. ""Vaccine Stocks"" thing?

Well sucks :/ Indian person would probably say they‚Äôre India city they‚Äôre Sort of... based Federal government data (the CDC), US Federal law, ""American Indian"" comprises enrolled members 500 some-odd tribes nations recognized US federal government lower 48 states.

""Alaska Native"" comprises enrolled members 20-some-odd tribes nations recognized US federal government Alaska.

The difference arises policy distinctions many years ago, carried over.

Usually, contexts, ""Native American"" used include groups. article written. However, headline writer (who generally article writer) apparently aware nuance. That's learn deserve friendship. I've seen stated elsewhere thread, illegal pharmacist knowingly give one deemed medically necessary beyond 2 dose vaccination schedule time. do, risking losing job license practice discovered beyond ethical implications. makes feel better, Native American colonialist term too... entire concept describes rooted colonialism.

Before Europeans came Indians Native Americans whatever... folks Cree, Comanche, Cahuilla, Choctaw, Cayuga, forth... ""Native American"" ethnic group, although created term along lines hyphenated-American ethnic groups. We're talking 500 different ethnic groups histories, traditions, religions, languages, forth. two same. tribe historically much common Mohawks Uzbeks.

Vaccinated still wearing mask public. would love discuss issue would happen somewhere else. That's Canada puts natives detention camps lol   Pfizer announced today developing vaccine target delta Wrong country. UEFA FIFA two different organizations, FIFA UEFA completely unrelated. AFAIK right EU letting US citizens provide vax card *or* negative test, could get tested. read article earlier talked abt stats. Something like 3/4 African countries don‚Äôt good record keeping births deaths, therefore it‚Äôs hard approximate death rate, look normal number deaths year, extra deaths guess number ppl died covid. Africa, many countries, bc deaths recorded, taken ppl even figure covid outbreaks happening. I‚Äôm sorry can‚Äôt link. believe read NYT article abt 1 month ago. wish wife resolve. That's patently untrue. Kids died covid, died covid vax. Complications may incredibly rare lie say Glad hear reservations never reservations. UEFA FIFA two different organizations, FIFA UEFA completely unrelated. fact still referred Indian sad. Imagine called name based mistaken identity.   
Not mention another category called Indian American refers people India makes even confusing. would wager Venn diagram people travel overseas, anti-vaxxers would use fake CDC card nearly two completely separate circles. It‚Äôs still important call establish independence matter. CDC FDA, reviewing data comes make final decision need booster vaccine later date, Albert Bourla. reiterate too, Johnson Johnson data suggests holds well Delta variant even researched people need booster. folks self identify Indian NDN. Follow Indian/ native news sources indigenous people areas you‚Äôll see variety labels preferences.  Vaccine passports good. way unvaxd choose without medical reason would banned non essential functions. Basically relegated grocery stores gas stations whenever leave home. deserve freedom movement afforded normal people. Reading news OP's source, Fiji seems reached testing capacity bottleneck. Hard say what's going without enough testing. Guilt. want admit massacred native Americans. Remind one year husbands adult siblings aren‚Äôt vaccinated aren‚Äôt allowing around daughter, worth risk delta variant. want see get shot. *Native Americans. Yay!!.. endless shots everyone! diet anti vaxer.

Depends you‚Äôre ok tail *and* third eye. Okay you‚Äôre making shit r/UsernameChecksOut said ANYTHING lockdown?

All people saying wear damn mask. hard.

People wear masks mask mandates businesses. comply vaccine passports. Rules rules. Requirements need put place. live California tell mask mandates wear mask kicked business police could called.  United States, Native American widely used falling favor groups, terms American Indian indigenous American preferred many Native people. wanted say good you. know side glances comments suck, keep it. think mom heroic.  Yeah exactly there‚Äôs little crowd noise majority events anyway, mainly music pumped people dancing camera. one know wtf going part they‚Äôre enjoy experience it. one voted you. part US from? west/Midwest places I've lived Indian native unless person political activist. Also check fuck talking about?  find amazing consider Johnson Johnson vaccine efficacy mid 60s perfectly acceptable, Pfizer‚Äôs efficacy potentially drops around number it‚Äôs cause alarm. 

You‚Äôre right tho, chances aren‚Äôt non existent. goalposts moved far started one even see original perspective anymore. 

It doesn‚Äôt really matter get it, especially you‚Äôre vaccinated. Even get it, chance serious illness death astronomically low. Nonexistent? Nope, we‚Äôre aiming that. We‚Äôre aiming reasonable protection. 

The whole reason lockdowns mask wearing viable vaccine covid want overwhelm hospital system. Now, plethora viable vaccines, things keep trending way are, hospitals danger. 

Yes people getting covid going continue get covid, one ever said goal completely prevent that. That‚Äôs something people started assuming along way. Ah yes, wheat chessboard problem. Ever consider possibility superspreader point? day husband started showing symptoms covid, cat started coughing lightly. joked could've covid, I'm pretty convinced was. 

Cat ok now, we. None individual choices kill people.  live Cali. Man it‚Äôs crazy many people wader around stores without mask like nothin happened all. I‚Äôm fully vaccinated still wear damn mask. Huh?

The comment responded white person telling native person using wrong terms describe themself. That's made comment did.   said many hospitalized Covid-19 patients ""shocked"" Covid-19 truly exists make people sick even kill them. ""A comment make time wish knew going end hospital sick would made different choice got vaccine,"" said.

Oh fuck's sake. Oh look yearly boosters like flu obligatory. Welcome new normal. Key words: ‚Äúat ‚ÄúFDA, CDC, [the National Institutes Health] engaged science-based, rigorous process consider whether booster might necessary,"" added.

Also One dose Pfizer-BioNTech AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine [""barely"" protects Delta virus, mutations variant developed, new study published journal Nature Thursday found. Well I'm happy ignore rule :)  budget much smaller might think. $4.8 billion 2020-2021. That‚Äôs scale poorest countries Earth. don‚Äôt resources purchase large quantities vaccines. waiting pancoronavirus vaccine though.

I also want pan-flu vaccine. Total game changer That‚Äôs businesses require it‚Ä¶. aren‚Äôt going want pay higher premiums employees won‚Äôt get despite faster vaccine rollout India's parts country cases. flu RSV. mix little shingrex? :) don‚Äôt actually know vaccination immunity wanes time, much. still literally researched Pfizer scientists speak. 

But whether it‚Äôs optimal approach, end day here‚Äôs reality situation US. We‚Äôre going back lockdown. ship sailed months ago. one that‚Äôs stopped wearing mask going start wearing one barring catastrophic event, save select few. 

Those fully vaccinated going resume normal lives, close depending comfortable are. chosen get vaccinated also resume normal lives don‚Äôt care covid, they‚Äôll probably get eventually pay consequences. vast majority people fine, die, society whole view acceptable pandemic fatigue time high, we‚Äôll chug along covid another normal disease nobody cares anymore. 

Is right way go things? Probably not. what‚Äôs going happen? Yes. ""48.7 percent natural immunity previous COVID-19 infection""

WHAT?!? Nearly half county Covid? could be? Regardless, relying roughly equal number vaccinated citizens infected citizens sound like smartest way reach herd immunity. rude, also also correct. said able still get effects Covid even though I'm vaccinated 100% true.
I'm obsessing I'm locking house. I'm taking necessary precautions get sick, everyone be.
The vaccine 100%. People public health guidance requires. CDC locale falls back line WHO, duty fellow man told. want this. Oh white savior coming think comparing antibiotic resistance. sounded plausible coincidental timing.

I understand microevolutions happen replication usually force drives it.

I‚Äôve yet hear anyone credible corroborate it. immune even get vaccine, listen people here. vaccine supposedly minimises chance getting really sick. Sorry rock, happened? know original delay honestly! I'm getting #3 flu shot October. Seems prudent thing do. wish combo shot Also vaccine efficacy really around 64 percent risk catching covid post vaccination necessarily small. Especially immunity wanes time. lot factors involved including whether high vaccinated vs. low vaccinated area, spread covid community. live unvaccinated people around every day work community, spread covid high area, chances getting small.

Second edit: yeah called craptastic sort shit get vaxxed man. I'm glad feel covid protection. teach trick rest class It‚Äôs guardian, pandemic turned massive click bait fear mongerrer Pfizer tried two formulations, 3rd original 3rd (and cases 4th) booster designed target SA variant. got 3rd original. seems that‚Äôs producing pretty impressive immune response data. Antibodies wane. expected. Apparently drop effectiveness Israel due healthcare workers vaxxed 6 months getting infected. Israel first country population widely vaxxed. Theyre nearly 5 months ahead UK. Israel Ministry Health backs study, too.

Again, antibodies wane. That's nature beast. antibodies wane, get infected, memory cells protect severe COVID make harder transmit virus.

I completely believe case Israel. So, comes question, cool virus spreading, hospitals longer overwhelmed? Id hope so, inevitable unless want give boosters every 6 months. makes way less tantalizing headline though.

We need get everyone 2 shots, select 3. employers requiring proof vaccination employees. IFR 1% 13% unvaccinated, means still people may die COVID far. fucks sake, 2021. stop referring Native Americans American Indians? Considering fucking India stupid call Indians unless specifically want called that. sure ""lie"" sorts. left another comment explaining think happening IMO. I'm sure risk analysis discovered getting unvaccinated people vaccinated giving boosters already vaccinated terms impact hospitalizations overall spread. telling people need additional shots prevent unvaccinated people getting vaccinated. 

So similar ""lie"" mean protect health care workers, think dishonest transparent perhaps ""protecting"" unvaccinated, want scare want focus getting vaccinated. mRNA vaccines still effective preventing hospitalization death (though less Delta variant) CDC could care less breakthrough cases result that, even results things like long covid health problems. call Delta Day? Please stop calling Indians So, trail tears wasn‚Äôt enough huh? hols years ago. Cracking bunch lads. mind em all. inclusive get whateva u want. Running like they're crack haha. Good bunch Tunis brothers.

God bless England. COMING HOME True, although read Delta also spreading part vaccinated people, though agree though CDC FDA look things high level assume based analysis would greater impact getting unvaccinated people get initial shot(s) vs. focusing right booster shots already vaccinated. want scare unvaccinated people thinking vaccines ineffective may need booster shots.

I'm still unhappy though CDC FDA transparent honest rest us vaccinated. believe flat lying; know need booster shots (soon). care ever breakthrough infections (the CDC even track anymore unless result hospitalization death). breakthrough infections potentially lead long covid health problems, wish paid attention them. Oh, well. still want around types  would guessing neither spouse kids thenüò∫ Guys im sorry failing states but, try get shit together.

Sincerely, canada.  Mate, ones get skip queue Scotty marketing VIPs political clout. sell lockdown stupid population? Call intelligent. Exactly. goal get rest country vaccinated, fully transparent. 

They therefore focus selling initial shots unvaccinated people know help suggest 1-2 enough (depending vaccine get). 

They absolutely know booster shots required needed soon, withholding information stop vaccine hesitant people reason say vaccines effective avoid getting vaccinated.

I guarantee couple months, done trying vaccinate rest United States, announce already vaccinated booster shots needed (soon). Yeah guess depends actually started working it. Possibly also spreading due astra zeneca J&amp;J less effective Dleta mRNA vaccines are. would possibly partially explain big current wave UK something like 50% vaccine doses astra zeneca, compared places seeing much smaller Delta surges. take, someone else.  Define high. pockets high.

Cries one pockets barely 50% one shot. Oh sure, thanks contribution captain obvious. AFAIK current research seems point direction. Antibodies SARS-CoV-2 transmitted placenta much less diseases, e.g. influenza pertussis. preliminary, seems vary stage gestation well.

In case, antibodies transmitted mother provide short-term protection infant. first Biontech shot couldnt go work next day. felt terrible happy finally got it, didnt care. Im little afraid second possibly third compare pros cons literally inargueable. protection get leave work early case immediately start feeling side effects?

Nice.  private company came said ""limited data set"" showed countries paying money booster shots would helpful, yes. (yet?) publishing full analysis data. 

There reason wait (nominally) independent analysis experts FDA similar agencies approve medication vaccines giving out, rather trusting companies word effective / necessary are. 

Also worth noting: Pfizer's statement says 2 doses vaccine remains 95%+ effective severe illness Israel recently circulating Delta variant. would appear even internal analysis suggests current 2-dose plan continue suppress hospitilizations deaths, even effectiveness prevent minor cases covid.  say Native American already?

So yes ""A"" ok peers dropping like flies.

Now vulnerable would singing different tune afford asshole lack information brought light.

Plain simple. it, works.  Yeah going relatively low, think that's mainly due mixed signals. one first non-essential/healthcare people get vaccinated. could wait part ending pandemic. thought third shot, however, I'm sure. many studies (as recently within last month) said Covid immunity seems last long time, perhaps even long 10+ years. CEO Pfizer, stands make tens billions dollars third shot, telling us need third dose. really buy it, think people either. completely conflicting studies literally show exact opposite results? One must result bad science, bias, both. Plenty examples contrary. better phrase would vaccines reduce transmissions. agree age band strategy resulted significant youth infection, counterfactual done even vaccination resulting optimal outcomes whole lot supporting data. 

While hospitalization risk someone 50-60 4X someone 30, death rate 35X higher. Even spread vaccination strategy would reduce cases 25-30X order result fewer deaths (if objective function trying optimize). clear number vaccines spread across larger pool would effective reducing cases 20X+ times justify policy - especially Delta proven thrown traditional herd immunity levels window (50% even vaccination across 18-60 would stop rapid exponential growth). 

Age death risk strongly correlated considering community spread reduction secondary making sure oldest vaccinated first. Even 35 year olds 4X death risk 25 year old. 

The UK similar ""problem"" vaccination strategy, context deaths, seems like strategy indeed optimal: 90% age 45+ fully vaccinated, damage COVID significantly lessened.   odds, stakes. antivaxxer tried tell know affect Indians different genetics among different tribes working Navajos mean anything lmao Ok.

Wearing mask nothing enriching life is. say ""I would rather people die let gubmint data"", bullshit excuses typing worthless.   healthcare workers tend higher exposure levels work vulnerable populations. 

Even FDA/CDC want move forward boosters everyone, would probably make sense approve recommend healthcare workers, high risk people, close contacts high risk people. circled back American Indian preferred nominclature? Well, I‚Äôd less. Point taken Pretty sad. I've come realize family. So...I‚Äôve watching closely past days. think consensus Pfizer/Moderna protect actually catching symptomatic version Covid 88% severe disease/hospitalization 95% NOW. 64% number Israel includes positive ASYMPTOMATIC cases, confusing. Israel received doses months earlier US. I‚Äôm speculating here, guess starting see positives comfortable based Israel study thinking protection waning due delta variant lowering antibodies time. TLDR- think we‚Äôre safe right think accurate statement Fauci, subject change time. 

I want add, wish people would give scientists break. brand new virus 18 months ago, wow, look accomplished amazing vaccines. Nature science never perfect always changing, can‚Äôt people calm let guidance evolve? Honestly, think exact approach need right now. would hate say everything ok afraid change minds longer way. well may happen need accept that. obviously evolving situation, let way enjoy vaccine now, accept may need booster point.

I wish us, humans, could quick efficient solving climate change that's happening. Worry that. get us end, sooner rather later seems. Gathering shaming really needs end. really good vaccines available basically anyone susceptible disease. yes, immunocompromised well &lt;12s fall camp. However, former small percentage population risk very, low latter. 

The pandemic over, unquestionably entered new phase okay people go live lives. I‚Äôm Northeast area good vaccine rates really low cases it‚Äôs still common courtesy wear mask inside business‚Ä¶ layman opinion, provide boosters vulnerable (immune compromised extreme elderely) frontline healthcare workers routinely around vulnerable.

 Everyone else substantial protection severe disease and, even 6 months, able clear virus much quicker, reduce viral shedding, lower viral load compared unvaxx, likely major impact transmission. So, community level, COVID lose lot steam even aftet antibodies wane majority population due memory cell response robust.  Tough part another negligible risk, babies toddlers heart major health issues undiagnosed due young age. gets tricky. things obvious kids developing heart problems yet detected. Parents free keep kids however much bubble feel comfortable with. societal point view tradeoff allowing millions adults live normal lives worth adults kids interact getting sick. That's risk comes life. We're past point many people going hospitalized people going die things there's simply beds help them.  fault. good see subs bit balanced days.

Maybe ignorant fight it, smart people   Nothing, people want admit ideology wrong. people would rather die admit wrong. people refusing vaccine purely medical concerns, political groupthink/conspiracies thinly veiled medical concerns. ""My wife driving influence, I'm afraid hurt others""

yem\_slave: ""respect personal decision"" elaborate response, vaccine-resistant variant higher chance emergence (or rather, dominance) partially vaccinated population unvaccinated population, simply increase reproduction rate specific variant other, resistant variants.

If variant resistant vaccines emerges unvaccinated population (provided trait differentiates dominant circulating variant), become dominant (well, likely... anything happen, chance). become dominant variant vaccinated population (obviously), dramatically increase potential network transmission, likely become dominant whole population. Simply put, resistant variant evolves unvaccinated population, reason become dominant, evolutionary advantage variants, might even die out. introduce vaccinated population, enormous evolutionary advantage. Kids really great risk compared type people go country music festivals. looks like fun. getting downvoted?
Does make people feel better pretend fact? I'm sorry. empathetic person, important people remember people dying things, cannot access treatment services makes things even difficult.

I mean, complain since I'm idiot wanted vaccinated everything could. saying, get everything military, whether want not.  aren't, indeed Haha okay. Thanks too.  Long covid rare worst, vaccines help it, time reopen everything countries high vaccinating rates regardless cases  Yeah, flu usually. facilitating conversation imagine mental gymnastics.

Bizzare reality literally punching people face (or lungs usually) people attached ideas stuck idea can't wrong, willing literally sacrifice family members admit mistaken. Vaccines designed both. (but all) vaccines provide good protection infection addition severe disease. High enough vaccination rates typically used eradicate diseases. Measles significantly contagious even Delta eradicated aggressive vaccination campaigns. 

But we're splitting hairs. Two different questions. COVID eradication via vaccines definitely objective indeed feasible (it likely rates high enough); different trying achieve COVID eradication behavioral changes (lockdowns, excessive restrictions, etc). latter table high-vax country. First:

Who claim Georgia? 

Second:

How people South Asia come called Indian? seems word given outsiders. people living call Indian Dutch, Portuguese French English Persians Greeks came? problem people know masks, get vaccine. healthcare teachers. Soo.....yea talkin' whole bridge section it? parts overlook water? Asking friend. can't even respond without writing novel, one asked Coronavirus thread.

Thanks link. Yah b ass hole. Take easy &amp; safe designed produce immune response. usually means prevent illness least death hospitalization. quit kinda stuck. explained said quit. Sorry catch sarcasm.  clear, that's antibodies. memory cell response seems robust, may provide long term protection. We're talking years upon years. Unfortunately, since antibodies wane, means vaxxed individuals start get infected higher rate, memory cell response robust- even infected likely wont develop extreme symptoms clear virus much quicker, lower viral load, reduced viral shedding, reduce transmission community level.

Make mistake, highly vaccinated area take steam COVID. ones willing die really creep out, ""if time go..."" would scoff efficacy pretty useless number two reasons.

1. says nothing risk hospitalizations deaths, risk infection. Covid already endemic, learn live risk re-infections.
2. number means little without also knowing confidence interval standard deviation presented underlying study.

Unfortunately mass media outlets gloss (or likely, ignorant) facts want ""**pfizer vaccine may 57% effective new sigma-faraday variation!**"" clicks.  Republicans care family. Nothing new.  saw little protest people anti-mask signs saying masks restricting right oxygen, quarantine tyranny, masks don‚Äôt prevent spread viruses. hate too. High usa, remarkably good, all, end result. comparison clear developed countries sail past us.

But agree, happy here. I'm re-opening.

But re-opening begore everyone, wants vaccinated, fully vaccinated, turning great idea.

In country Netherlands would take another two months. two months.

We re-opened soon, imho. performers care $$$ Ever hear Mary Mallon? government ABSOLUTELY infringe person's rights interest public health. seems expensive. need printer make US.

And conservative numbers, already 67% full 86% single. fuckery forever? high vaccination rates

Here florida we're even tracking properly more, assume we're 100%, right?

Do expect NPR send journalists every concert, sporting event, bar, festival mass gathering? They're picking one event thousands write ""boots ground"" story trend happening across country.

The suggestion put forward incredibly dense assuming sort social pressure/power dynamic would ever used ‚Äògood‚Äô, incredibly naive.

Oh wait. Rich white people swooping get vaccines almost racist caricature reflective vaccine was/is distributed 

Vaccines rolled age groups anyone could make appointments - never first come first serve.

Also - working people races dealt work dilemma scheduling appointment/dealing side effects. That‚Äôs problem exclusive black people, can‚Äôt attribute reason black people disproportionately less vaccined.

It‚Äôs accessibility issue. personal/anecdotal experience, truly boils distrust government. That‚Äôs recently, least state, PSAs TV trusted black public figures urging black community get vaccine. youx not, kidnapper us poodle somewhat agree this. hospitals danger overrun COVID patients, it‚Äôs definitely time implement serious mitigation measures restrictions. %70+ adult population track fully vaccinated (like state), agree it‚Äôs best left individual decide navigate this.

You correct one-size-fits approach doesn‚Äôt work, it‚Äôs true enter phase pandemic beginning. Every hospital employee patient facing potential super spreader. Nice humble brag!  I‚Äôm sure live call fringe minority count lucky. Darwin busy neck woods empathy ended around half million mark mattering folks. Captain_Natsu linked Australia's minister Health Aged Care, calling liar bit unfair, it? minister lying, point out, unreasonable expect government officials charge vaccine rollout understand they're doing, communicate status clearly.

Pfizer's statement total amount vaccines scheduled 2021 changed, actually contradictory minister said, pace vaccine deliveries going increase. They're moving deliveries forward, available earlier. 

Australia contracted 40 million doses 2021, enough vaccine 80% entire population, AstraZeneca, actually need vaccines 2021, need get doses they've already contracted fast possible. avoid liver damage unintentional overdose acetaminophen.

I'm exposed work (I teach special needs children) I'm thinking every percentage point matters. I'm going put thought September comes around. Definitely interesting, ultimately disagree it. sympathize Native people, term Indian already taken. identity \~18% world's population. increasingly globalized world, strive use terms avoid confusion.

Slightly tongue cheek, Native American, I'd want Native part dropped altogether. Americans come America. Indians come India. USAians come USA? read general (or least scientific majority) consensus seems Corona become recurring issue like flu.

This means regularly updated vaccines vaccine shots people. Additionally would also say amount deaths hospitalizations accept new normal (like flu, car accidents, etc.).

The basis start probably going 80%+ initial vaccination population.

What additionally might come this, personally hope so, people taking responsibility are/feel ill. Meaning use mask feel ill (be Corona, flu, common cold), mingle people, preferably stay home. acceptance various countries, culture employers precaution worth it. Maybe...just maybe...it‚Äôs politics like 99% sub suggests. friend isn‚Äôt anti-vaccine, she‚Äôs afraid Covid vaccine afraid needles. wouldn‚Äôt shocked people apprehensive simply hate needles.  Possibly, seems like spiking case numbers NL caused directly reopening clubs, combined lax ""testing entry"" system error prone easy cheat. Last week party club home city, 200 600 attendants ended testing positive covid afterwards.

Our growth rate risen almost 400% one week, exactly clubs opened cases like party mentioned started coming out.

This could probably prevented waiting couple weeks youth would chance get shots. I'm '96 getting 2^(nd) shot August 8, safe say club-going demographic largely unprotected. Cheers, friend. ‚òπÔ∏è It‚Äôs weird literally wear treatment area anyway that‚Äôs standard care. like, leave patients, it‚Äôs hard. Glad walked though, hope find better dentist soon.

Even get full FDA approval, nutjobs still avoid vaccine random reason  J&amp;J would love get re-vaccinated something works bit better delta variant. got pretty early (late march) realized issues nurses generally ones choosing to.

Nurses walking, talking Dunning-Kruger effect examples.  Get 2 4 year degree think know everyone else medicine. Ahh misunderstood part parent comment referring to. You‚Äôre right, definitely widely mandated full approval.  feels politics disease Yep, today around 35,000 new cases announced 29 deaths

The last time daily cases hit around 35,000 upward trend 16th December, day 433 deaths.

The number deaths give much better indicator pandemic plays highly vaccinated population Many governors backed health departments emergency powers reduced party power legislature. Doesn‚Äôt bode well fall  two different viruses, need different methods protect young children. Also, responding comment compared covid flu.

The covid mortality children safety restrictions mortality flu children.

Another problem covid transmission rate much higher. even mortality rate appears low, number infected children much larger. result many pediatric deaths compared flu.   dull pain thx primarily work middle/high schoolers, really can't take another year playing mask police. exactly would work? sort punishment would metted law would cite basis? think America looks rough wait door door vax goons start injecting people front porch. Probably always way going forward. another link showing r value one UK government. r value 1 considered exponential. please tell Even researchers stop developing boosters aimed new variants, going able amp production improve global vaccine distribution. That's job. priority thus far hospitalizations deaths covid **enough** research data, mean potential problem. CDC collecting data long covid. even looking breakthrough cases vaccines. sole focus hospitalizations/deaths...for now. get data later, point pointing significant number adults getting long covid specific evidence reports regarding reduces odds significantly. Good luck Godspeed Mine personally? None? neighbor kid got bone marrow transplant. his? It‚Äôs people like fuckers shitting on. I‚Äôll fine. could care less people like collecting Darwin awards. wish could hand point. Maybe not....but vaccine free! Back drawing board!  understand, getting immunized prevent re-contracting virus, prevent spreading others. time get confused somebody incredibly smart unbelievably stupid time think make sense, remember Ben Carson. Good... Exponential mean cases every day, means rate increase also increasing. Families can't afford that. need provide families cannot afford them.

But want student body protected, us. Look advanced nations responding look US. Absolutely abysmal. dull pain randomly hurts second two wouldnt worry it. got tetanus shot years ago shoulder random pains months after.

If serious pain really worried - would call doctor. help.  It‚Äôs getting increasingly harder tell best interests, though seem feel like little bit cash grab companies.

I know american contracts are. EU population 400 million ordered 2.4 billion doses Pfizer 900 million option new variant. think EU least always kind expected 2*person would needed even plan give away some.

I know booster would put people off. yearly vaccinations flu. ago thought would get vaccine one shot, require two shots. booster nothing ordinary.

Also regarding pfizer need cash grabs, got orders lined long while. wonder USA ordering 500 million doses ostensibly donate preparing booster required, know many ""slots"" orders USA has.

Keep mind large stock might need donated expires. important understand contracts delivery much when. Please stop feeding troll. arguing good faith.  even fully immunized still partially immune strains. It‚Äôs surprising seemingly many nurses goddamn stupid. never hear doctor refusing vaccine. Yet always hear fucking hero worshipped nurses causing stink. Got family healthcare it‚Äôs always nurse isn‚Äôt vaccinated. either believe don‚Äôt. won‚Äôt get vaccinated, get healthcare. went regular dentist (Kansas) cleaning assuming everyone would wearing mask promptly walked back literally nobody wearing one. Since problems understanding see UK announcing cases everyday? yes exponential growth! Apologies assumption. I‚Äôm wanted vaccinated given ample opportunities cost. point struggling get folks show shot 2 anti-Vax people show all. blanket ""no""...? nothing support it. Ok scientists spoke CBC News assert research NML actually behind China terms technology discovery, nothing steal. No, think close society expert realized that's ""healthier"" whatever. Sometimes things matter what's healthy, that's something covid doctor imperially measure you. let's honest: fully vaccinated much protection loose cloth mask afford? Maybe single-digit protection? really want student body protected campus they'd mandate N95 equivalent high-filtration masks. Uh. No. want travel safely amongst non-disease vectors. Spanish flu, you‚Äôd leg stand choice, don‚Äôt. cure. want plague monkey, stay home like told us super oppressive ‚Äúlockdowns‚Äù ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs freedom freedom safe you. Two sided sword jazz. think getting people thoughtful feel sick even asking much countries like mine particular (US). step son wearing mask school people not, benefit it? CDC spent better part 18 months telling us masks keep wearer safe, keep others safe. understand meaning exponential. understand...they absolutely tracking long covid...in anyone. Adults kids. tracking breakthrough cases either.

The CDC 100% focused hospitalizations deaths covid point.

Not even recently long covid even taken seriously.

There lot data however regarding long term effects adults extensive research kids *yet* mean ignore it.

**Some data exist however, indicating potentially significant number kids may develop long covid post covid heath  idea long term effects it.

I think that's accurate. COVID may throw us curveballs, know basic things physiology immunology.

It's like worried new year 2022 Ford model \*could\* spontaneously explode. mean, they've done crash tests people test driving nobody driven one 10 years know whether suddenly blow computer logs 10 years operation.

COULD happen... sure. would surprised many nurses hate masks vaccines blows mind. nurse go full rant Biden cant tell mind business. get this...she covid last year started... CDC released guidance saying vaccinated students need wear masks. wish hospitals could state (Oregon).  State law allows employers require vaccines except health care workers, law enforcement, firefighters, prison workers.  exempted ones seem like ones need vaccines most.

And I'm avoiding non-urgent medical care know local hospital full anti-vaxxer nutjobs BFD every flu season nurses refuse flu shots. know coming, remove masks early? *sigh* I'm arguing vaccines slightly less effective latest strains.

I know guys enough plate ultimately, student + parents responsibility, like flu, come through. done math getting injured vaccine? way lower...!&lt; mRNA vaccines protect specific spike protein used attach host cell. significant variation make vaccine pretty much useless. 

But specific spike protein also exactly makes dangerous first place. change spike protein significant enough allow completely evade vaccines would also likely destroy ability attach host cells, making virus completely useless point. Another country guys sworn ""beat COVID.""

How many times guys going wrong admit know anything?  idea what‚Äôs going picture it‚Äôs perfect   probably want hear, but... living fully-vaccinated, normal life. Went club first time. couple house parties. awesome. got sick, thought cold. Tested positive covid days ago. I'm back quarantine life. Really sucks. I'm thankful vaccine likely reduced severity minimized chances spreading others (so far one else around tested positive). I'm done quarantine period certainly go back living normally.

Get vaccinated, stay informed, doom scroll social media. definitely healthy. ""trust science"" man probably already has, case fatality rate seems lower first discovered Wuhan. Also props pulling sources, I'm lazy good see people backing anti-vaxxers? 
or spineless state federal government taking strong stand people like FACT- opinion- threat public health entire nation. me, ""very cautious"" means watching normally do. wrecking yet another year education children ""just case"" problem line.

Not sound cliche, hell happened ""Think Children!"" Yeah figures change countries different standards, unfortunate someone's entire argument ""your minimums herd immunity 10% lower ew"". Woah, awful vaccination rate. wonder lacked access vaccine, thinking already beaten it. well known over-use antibiotics feeds mutation bacterias, don‚Äôt know could similiar effect viruses?

If so, would solution be? Take upvote heathen  10.9%. Appalling.

Honestly think world would better place without heartless, despicable people like it.  confirmed. estimates million.

and get case estimates, estimate flu deaths year. info found countries substantial vaccination rates. I'm aware factors play, happened/happens places like India, Nepal, Indonesia, Tunisia South Africa really suggest less lethal previous variants. anything, various (admittedly anecdotal) stories read quickly people deteriorated initial onset symptoms point death (for example India), may actually opposite. full vaccination Canada European countries hovering around 30-45%

Yet. Canada, 69% people got least one dose vs 55% usa.  kids many ACE2 receptors, Covid binds to. Daycare-age kids even fewer  Agree. kids problem virtual learning anyway. say want go hospital don‚Äôt mandate vaccination? right. 

Can say want go hospital serve Pepsi products coke products. right. According study. It‚Äôs really concern least vaccine 220 high 280 covid, physical labor job gym helped. Lost job family pass covid, made depressed. I‚Äôm 250 struggling, I‚Äôve gone gym comfortable due covid letting self go. guess need man it. fully vaccinated nervous it. lost 4 relatives covid, ages 33-65. Easy say, difficult unpopular do: stay home parent. emergency approval still approval though full noted. employers still require vaccinated. goverment can't quite, force anyone take per say, unless wanted long court battles. fully approved government could actually force people get vaccinated.

as full approval, could literally moment. reason duration protection unknown. Boris gone absolutely mental. sizable portion entire generation going sacrificed, either death disability, what? damage Covid killed people many poor countries virus.

Source? live here. shit see go beyond anything make up. Friends family work healthcare refusing vaccines masks. school area never reporting cases year. Shit crazy.   seem like lot? yeah, happening, overkill, people going Turn CNN news alerts. Problem solved! Gee, shame. stop worrying virus, block subreddit good, focus healing trauma caused pandemic

Yes. trust science, I'm vaccinated life largely back normal. feel people areas people vaccinated life largely back normal feel guilt that. thing working measles animal reservoir, unlike SARS-CoV-2.

One cross event constitute animal reservoir. like constantly deal SIV jumping humans restarting HIV outbreak.

Regarding whether measels counts eradication, semantics really matter. public health measures apart vaccination needed control it.  Purposefully knocking stack papers someone's hand might low cost legal seem think is. tried digging see could find. looking table IFR per age bracket CDC's website think took down. Instead guess I'll compare raw numbers. age bracket 18-29 year olds. US 16.4% population, looks like roughly 3,300 covid deaths age group. 36,000 traffic fatalities year, could guess 5,900 occur 18-29 age group. 

Covid around longer year now, fair scale 3,300 deaths order compare apples apples 5,900 traffic deaths. simple metric, 25 year old two times likely die car die covid, every 18-29 car past year, whereas catch covid yet, could scale covid numbers back starts get even foggier exactly much. 

So comparison totally unfair, though looking strictly lens personal risk ignores young people vaccinating makes higher risk population safer. Young people vaccinating also would help virus die completely opposed letting mutate more. That‚Äôs fully vaxxed- 54.4% one dose already. went 1.3 1.2. BIL making fun cautious still.

That's good hear. biggest fear still ending long COVID. vaccines designed stop cases

How keep getting repeated sub time. Vaccines designed train immune system specific pathogen, thing vaccine designed prevent cases another vaccine prevent deaths. 

They causes various benefits reduced chance infection, transmission, mild disease, serious disease death, differing efficacy rates depending vaccine. Right? people assume replicated slower? According picture caption

Important remember, it‚Äôs anti Vaxers people don‚Äôt access vaccines all. countries don‚Äôt access like US does. also puts children comorbidities terrible position exactly try tell people. son age starting preschool don‚Äôt know go it, everyone dropping requirements vaccine numbers there.

But, .000001% people immunocompromised! Delta variant! Please, need scared feel empowered tell else terrorist intellectual high ground says college professor Fauci. What? That's works.

The Pfizer vaccine, looking material gets shot you, material gone two weeks. gone. end peeing out.

It provides instructions cells make spike protein days. instructions version spike can't enter cells, looks extra scary immune system. spikes gone within weeks too.

Your immune system sees spikes, freaks out, makes Memory B cells make antibodies spike. Then, get virus you, spikes get covered antibodies can't enter cells.

If while, many antibodies used to, soon immune system detects virus, tells memory B cells make tons antibodies. Yes, according news today growing slower rate last week. Smaller percentage cases Indigenous seems broad, unless specifies continent. case, North America. natives name continent instead using North America? No, 12-18 need vaccinated, 5-11 come negative PCR. happening Tunisia. haven‚Äôt seen studies identified certain groups prone breakthroughs share links? Agreed. amount paranoid westerners clamoring booster shot developing world even one sickening. that, maps showing counting come up. Again, depending ask, counts part south.  nailed it. main reason huge discrepancy effectivity studies around world attributed two main factors:

1. methodology employed countries, IIRC Israel picks infection failure inmediate ability vaccine (leading 1/3 reduction infection prevention).

2. Delta reproducing more, meaning time linger around body cause symptons - body picks antibody production rate destroys it. Studies report results 2 weeks recognized asymptomatic increase relation previous symptons IIRC. Two. yeah, fully vaxxed two doses still catch/spread Delta variant.  Yeah understand comes from. also live area high population American Indians know that's *their* preferred term. crazy would correct them. Eventually West need get vaccines arms globally, rather talking eking couple percentage points using boosters, vaccinating babies. Read Shirley Bennett's voice.  understand that. live Bay Area, particularly SF, students online previous school year without even hybrid option (and that, even offered district, made available month May). CDC guidance actually quite significant regard. I‚Äôm saying students shouldn‚Äôt wearing masks, point need back full time. LOL said countries poorly vaccinated defenseless child seeing dangerous therapist like that? Great parenting. blame lies pushing antivaxx narrative. friends relatives hopelessly confused safety efficacy vaccines get ""news"" Facebook. many folk, fed false narrative that's made scared paranoid believe anything official source anymore.

Yes, themselves, without remorseless drumbeat antivaxx lies, many would reachable effort.  Data UK showing risk hospitalization nearly double Delta compared Alpha, multiplier 1.9 think. Fully vaccinated people drastically reduced risk hospitalization compared un-vaccinated people, groups 1.9 multiplier applied risk (compared Alpha).  thing already????  Reposting elsewhere:

If second dose likely first dose trigger myocarditis, mean third doses? prospect Pfizer boosters rolling dice myocarditis risk time? also removing mask mandates time seems Delta variant infect vaccinated, seems like bad mix altogether. damned situation. still get COVID vaccinated. vaccination protects severe effects COVID result hospitalization death. Also, also still pass others. Vaccination make immune. Delta variant killed vaccinated people, too. Granted, very, rare, still risk. Many literally believe arguments, scared accept anyone tells want hear.  Ever heard something called law happen area [""mom intentionally test kids -- therefore ensuring Covid cases -- chance?  right federal mandates education, policies governing classrooms much remit state local governments. federal government cajole threaten pull funding, effective would outside full blown crisis, I'm sure.

I doubt Biden administration looking way navigate treacherous political waters without making many waves. looks like decision made focus targeted vaccination efforts, presumably thought would non-controversial, even there, severely underestimated conservative paranoia conservative politicians' desire pounce anything bolster street cred base.

And they're clearly using carrot stick reinforcing efficacy vaccines broadcasting loud clear vaccinations means return normalcy. agree enough, unvaccinated start dying large numbers, know would move 50% Republicans refuse get jab. not

Your guess objectively wrong. recent report stated Delta contagious days quicker original strain. DJT come said [Covid] dangerous begin vaccination best chance along masking, we‚Äôd better place. can‚Äôt unring bell. do. That's general, widespread consensus. 50% doctors average sympathy levels time low. Make pay treatment pocket premiums don‚Äôt go account stupidity.

Surely heard before. confirm, 4 nurses family..... would always complain getting tb tests, flu vaccines, hepatitis vaccines..... mandatory.... guess what? it..... mainly complained travel hr/staffing locations site work. Yes. imagine Europe Canada pull ahead full vaccination sooner later since significantly higher number first doses. Maybe that's plan. honestly see getting better here. Obviously better last year, whomever wanted vaccine got it. low vac rates, anti mask sentiment unvaccinated, policies place make safeguarding companies difficult illegal. kid may high risk, go back teaching university (that measures) 3 weeks...I give life honestly. Hi. get rapid tested? Thank you. don‚Äôt actually know anyone who‚Äôs getting vaccinated. I‚Äôve wearing FFP2 masks months doesn‚Äôt bother continue wearing indoors I‚Äôm people time being, what‚Äôs harm? tested antibodies? also live NJ know many kids antibodies never sick. maybe wouldn‚Äôt worry much. benefits antibodies disease training immune system mitigate negative health impacts virus value...  Please report her. nurse, I'm sure putting patients risk ways.  friend doctor also going chemo treatment breast cancer right now. still got vaccine.

People immune compromised generally get vaccine. problem vaccine trigger strong immune response, people likely produce antibodies. vaccine dangerous them, vaccine contain virus.   Vaccines way out. near-miracle efficacy vaccines can't end Covid, cloth mask goes pocket day isn't. Get vaccinated, tell friends to, tell family.  Indianer US would someone state Indiana. You‚Äôre good. vaccine 90% effective it‚Äôs still possible catch it. catch it, immune system good enough take care - symptoms milder. I‚Äôd use precautions spread it. always thought ridiculous many people sub made seem like impossible happen. suspect lot us get COVID point, even vaccine, get horrible symptoms die. Considering trials happened particular time world world shut down, closed borders, distancing, wearing mask, still yet chance see things look like ""normal"" scenario really. long hospitals get overrun, vaccine done job. FDA approved, right?  work Indian-americans, American Indians people post about. 50% increase week night clubs would closed would problem would time anticipate potentially increasing hospitalizations.

But got tenfold increase 9 days. means justifiable experiment. flash we'll see March 2020 watch out.  biggest thing would help right leaning leadership news outlets would push rather active disinformation campaign currently waged. Missouri governor wants dead citizens 

There fixed headline That... model Rt. model bynomial distribution since know true R. epiforcasts explains [their US median 90% credible interval shown.

It high low. single number statistical estimate area. we‚Äôve conditioned sue everything hopes winning major lawsuit. think partly people admitting wrong anytime great persists. I‚Äôm ready done still think careful overall. We‚Äôre almost feels like Exactly! Tracking killing would also someone's personal choice, feeling ok that.

Why exactly ""personal choice"" matter talking stuff? Nearly every law book stop ""personal choice"". doesn‚Äôt always clear up. previously healthy male early 20s Columbia Presbyterian right underwent heart transplant weeks second shot. thought talking school aged kids parents? extension, thoughts make sense districts reasonable accommodation (online school) many families need it.

It‚Äôs endemic yet, be. It‚Äôs still pandemic there‚Äôs lot people standing navy ship sign big red letters saying MISSION ACCOMPLISHED. like Bush did. mission wasn‚Äôt accomplished country mile neither pandemic. 

It sounds like you‚Äôve worn it‚Äôs taken long you‚Äôve resigned whatever happens it‚Äôs convenient. I‚Äôm afraid living fear it‚Äôs clear see anybody reading literature fall going bad everybody - lot worse unvaccinated people. Vaccines like bullet proof vests, protect people general lots people still get seriously injured die wearing them. Right things ""fixed"" poobt say Wow see fuck Biden admin been. told so. Also virus deal bunch talking points. man recieved vaccine refusing liar personal choice way beating people like personal choice. 

Not sure people think ""personal choice"" type silver bullet fight regulations. There's many personal choices allowed do. still trying disprove UK exponential growth?

Edit: lot removed posts sub  rate change negative exponential. LOL, imagine using anecdotal evidence anonymous people online reason idiot. I'm sorry, one US culture erased American Indians. Indian Americans *far* representation US American Indians. dont win battle all. Native American *is* suitable name simple. know ""1"" say ""Exponential growth anything 1"". mean rate change incorrect. Yes, also decreases trust doctors. Underated comment can't really draw many conclusions that, though.

Different vaccines going elicit different levels response 3 doses DTaP might elicit X level antibodies Tetanus (and diseases), mRNA vaccines elicit 20X level antibodies 2 doses. That's really rough - even vaccine, lost smell. hope get better soon. visited often 2020 even cities like Miami felt open compared NYC. (badly enforced) mask mandates, felt pretty free.

Florida may refusing report hospitalizations, lot harder hide deaths.

But I'm glad we're agreed make top 20. would good gesture correct slightly misleading post above. personal freedumb???

/s they're ones using, preferring word Indian, would ok name sense convenience, ignorance, both? little control decision making, even ‚Äúsovereign‚Äù nations. 

Then let pick name... seems they've chosen Indian. Unless Indians start using preferring different term, Indian correct term. American Indian want clearer respectful mind.   entire argument based civil war era allegiance? ROFL. Government knows best. keep happening. Spanish flu still exists (swine flu) yearly flu vaccinations account that. Covid variants keep happening. hope keep enough people vaccinated limit worst effects. would love hospital really push this. unfortunately leadership conservative koolaid gallon consumers, surprise many coworkers also antivax dipshits...oh mean dumbfucks....I mean vaccinated ""Exponential"" refers rate growth, whether change positive negative. inverse exponential growth, value decreases rate proportional itself, exponential decay. Lived Northeast Midwest Fully vaccinated Moderna past months got tested positive COVID! heart rate bit high doctors say it‚Äôs normal probably last even recovery.

Lasted 6 days. think explained would found issue wrong. 

Honestly lot people spoiled, used getting want, believing things consequences side effects. lots convinced want yo vaccinated. want perfect solutions, want want, bear concept vaccine works like mild infection. Perfection real friend  One biggest problems covid knowing many variables stem that.

The chief issue, though, comes knowing COVID spread easily.

If Delta spreading easily OG COVID, end result still worse. silver lining really help.

For really crappy analogy, would like someone tossed 1000 pounds bricks back Prius someone said ""Hey, silver lining regenerative breaking generate energy."" Well, really matter already wrecked fuel consumption extra 1000 pounds getting regenerative breaking really help.  younger elementary preschool kids? proof that? Sure schools shut kid two tested positive, ‚Äúoutbreaks‚Äù student student transmission. Also, private schools able stay open teach person without issues, public schools couldn‚Äôt manage it? guy thumbed down... know vaccine takes couple weeks take effect right? ... ok hospitalized breakthrough cases‚Ä¶  4,840 new cases today :| also crazy shit like non-tribal person commits crime tribal land tribe can‚Äôt anything it‚Äôs separate. local police suck nothing gets changed.

There‚Äôs lot gray area they‚Äôre kind letting people figure think, better worse. fact you‚Äôre giving consideration probably better lot people. Even vaccines, prevailing opinion symptoms gone you‚Äôre almost certainly still contagious (you‚Äôre contagious right right begin symptoms). asking me, I‚Äôd say you‚Äôre symptoms gone, you‚Äôre good go. Okay sociopath. current vaccines provide immunity variant? basically turned news mine got poked I'm wondering need start worrying. Lol none anything claims. 

There data evidence back up. 

What choose ""worry"" basis information spreading. beliefs clearly based science facts, matter many times *say* are.

You choose ""believe"" whatever want. Heck, people personally worry covid believe vaccines work nobody died covid.  that's R stable 1. one day R 2, next 1.9, next 1.8 on, exponential pattern growth slowing down. 

If stable growth rate 1.0001 would exponential growth though, yeah.  Vaccinated people still carry viruses, isn‚Äôt it? Sounds like problem young people vaccinated, bars clubs open. tooooo. 
Also immune-comprised, also sick hearing BS. 

People say things demonstrate behavior kind belief longer friends. Period. really think Delta variant proving deadly locations though.. although India way common multiple generations live one another / large crowd. South Carolina spread out, packed urban centers like states might have. 49% least partially vaccinated I'm sure good 10-20% top carrying antibodies covid already.  Nice kinda got ""more contagious"" part. comments add absolutely nothing discussion, pure cliche panic, fking worst. We're mid-July... soon symptoms showing delta?

Lots people also sleep lunch. yes Spain stupid social. everyone kisses everyone. nobody knows vaccinated. lol, loophole big enough semi? Lol. Well SEC fined companies 15% income unruly behavior bad accounting.  I'm around Atlanta able find single hospital requires staff vaccinated.

Sure, provide vaccines recommend it. require it. able find full staff did. IMO, fact COVID isn‚Äôt nightmare virus probably reason bad job containing it. I‚Äôm COVID denier, reality vast majority people get COVID end fine. includes things like long COVID. another pandemic happened much higher death rate, like 10% 20%, still believe people would take much seriously. 

Everybody likes make jokes zombie apocalypse happened today, half America would run towards zombies screaming they‚Äôre hoax. wouldn‚Äôt happen, zombies overt threat.

What?

It's way around. Eg:. data Scotland. Data Israel looks similar.

The data English public health sector closer, still AZ behind: seen study Astrazeneca fairs better biontech/Pfizer Moderna vs variant.

Mind you, mean bad vaccine. much rather AZ vaccine. mRNA based vaccine score better around.

Highly active meaning 88%. I‚Äôm perplexed. guess that's point. care countries effects us. Delta came rampant virus India happened poor political decision making

Decisions America made affected world Suppose public colleges simply add ""must vaccinated"" admission requirements.  Students willing get vaccinated, accepted. others, willing, less competition admission. likely would convince anyone get vaccinated already, campus safer students faculty/staff. Plenty dead healthy adults would disagree weren‚Äôt DEAD Damn got lied to. There's vaccine, even medicine, zika.

Edit: specific. Unless year span (2016 2019 2020), could testing proposed vaccine. Otherwise something else.

Note: CDC two weeks ending July 3, 2021, shows Delta B.1.617.2 variant 51.7% share among 213 variants circulating US. page, select ""Nowcast On"" see 51.7% two weeks ending 7/3/2021. I'm bit concerned here, even vaccinated damn thing still fatal?  adults least partially vaccinated. 

If cases rise 5x before, could happen little rules place, chances you‚Äòll amount people hospital, counting vaccinated people experiencing breakthrough cases (e.g. older people immune system unable mount sufficient immune response). Additionally, you‚Äòll run risk essentially creating brooding station new variants likely escape vaccine protection. 

But honest, don‚Äòt know solution either given societies western world apparently unwilling unable squash virus (e.g. 20-30% populations simply unwilling take vaccines) pressure reopen keep rising, making new measures less less effective. strategy implementing half assed lockdowns order keep much economy running set fail beginning, better rip bandaid hope herd immunity faster hospitals reaching full capacity? 51% among health workers two week intervals, also single study (Butantan). Chile already published real-world study NEJM found efficacy vs symptomatic infection 66% case, reduction hospitalizations 87.5%. actual percentage breakthrough cases result long covid though? Stop whining. burden age. Buckle buttercup Yeah. want called American Indian, want called native American, care either way. trust little fly-by-night amateur CDC?   Predictable tourism stopped. See Pfizer‚Äôs latest Announcement  Everyone vaccinated still subject quarantine rules upon entering Canada. Fucking thank you. People keep downplaying fact delta variant drops vaccine efficacy 60s. ""But still wont hospitalized"" take someone got chronic illness mild virus, life ruined death. Im vaccinated wont drop mask cases low. uptick, im wearing damn mask. dont want ""mild"" case covid Im short breath laying bed. dont want thing all. Nobody should. fact people blase long covid says lot view chronic illness disability country. understand, antibodies generally wane time, body produces memory b cells response infection/vaccination body uses upon subsequent re-exposure. likely memory cells last long time, dont act immediately antibodies (I'm clear details this). So, still good protection variants, body might get mild infection time transmit virus. Plus got vanilla covid last year, antibodies may enough break chain transmission catch variant. Canada cannot deny entry Canadian citizens permanent residents, make quarantine vaccinated.  That's interesting point. husband thing also zero side effects getting Pfizer shots. stayed inside much could, limited number times went grocery shopping (or got deliveries), didnt hang friends family person, wore masks anytime home.  bestie nurse large city worked ward converted COVID.

She would sob told anti-vaxx/lockdown protesters outside hospital, first thing shift zip another COVID patient body bag. Boris Johnson probably one worst people want leading country pandemic. self-serving interests overall actions parallel like bull scenario Trump maybe bad pretty bad put bottom list people I'd want handling country pandemic.

On top that, vaccines general, adverse effects tend show *right away*. That's body reacts. would strange (and unlikely) vaccine different. Also indicating genetic component. wife got diagnosed ADHD adult explains much childhood. Turns mom also ADHD siblings. Seems like they‚Äôve able operate way different countries different regulations already Thank reply! Well, fuck then. meant British. Since care people getting sick? deaths holding up?  Lol countries TB killing people vaccination. 

I'm getting covid vaccine yet continue social distancing personal reasons. (I think vaccine tech rushed would rather play odds long shot make sure arent severe symptoms say 5 years road. I've worked pharma normal protocol new vaccine testing 5 years remember correctly.)

However, TB probably one WORST comparisons could make get vaccinated.  Tell usa like half population bill gates puts tracking nanobot vaccine nut job conspiracy theories. That's fair point, imagine UK Schengen Zone amounts majority tourism United States. 

Having said that, one countries already possession B-2 visa, there's realistically little stopping travelling US. Meanwhile, travel ban stopping tourism banned countries, stopping people legitimate work visas (who imagine mostly fully vaccinated individuals) entering US without two week stay unrestricted country beforehand. Free dlc Thank much! mandate vaccines instead mandating masks again? Either mandate sensible option don‚Äôt mandate anything anymore. mean also lot unknowns health effects covid vaccines long run  put perspective: cases per capita even peak India's second wave (although India probably under-reporting). outdoors, surrounded mostly vaccinated people. I'd guess risk low.  want go twice year get shots, first Pfizer shot took couple days tired week after, second shot needed single day I'd rather potentially write couple days year getting booster shots. I'd rather continue wearing masks vaccines can't provide long term protection covid becomes thing deal rest lives. got full pay worked home. Apples oranges compared nurse working COVID wing risking life pat back. WSJ:
The vaccine doesn‚Äôt offer much protection first two doses, however. company said appears vaccine‚Äôs effectiveness begins wane six months second dose, based clinical trials recent data released Israel Ministry Health.
Israel said earlier week that¬†the shot protected 64% inoculated people infection outbreak Delta variant, 94% before.
The vaccine still provided 94% protection severe illness outbreak, compared 97% before, health ministry said.

This seems make sense re: Israel started vaccinations December. addition others already said, Covid-19 long haulers reported symptom relief getting vaccines.

If concerned continue mask socially distance. healthy habit general think.

The vaccines provide lot protection regardless variant.  school district town made optional summer school said that‚Äôs fall too. think point people getting downvoted following CDC guidelines place fully derailed I'm done sub. 

See y'all life, I'm out. Canada exact issue US: public health provincial/state matter, result passport that‚Äôs federally derived isn‚Äôt really possible. get vaccine card Canada US. I'm scared kids young vaccinate. supposed masks required? I'll send kids masks, help everyone else running around without. flu lethal covid kids 12.

There LOT unknowns health effects covid.

In case, every age group far, vaccine objectively much safer getting covid. doubt going different children (if is, vaccine granted EUA).  think matter time vaccines children also approved. Vaccines developers started adults, already testing vaccines children now. 

It also would already help children immunocompromised adults adults general fully vaccinated Netherlands would closer herd immunity. think 46 % adults fully protected still high number. still means 54 % adults increased risk cases even young healthy adults getting seriously ill. 

Why wait least 2-3 months longer getting rid restrictions? number vaccinated people Netherlands would high soaring numbers anymore everything gets back normal.    Awesome! Thanks, counting people that.  bet do. don‚Äôt mean rude sounds like problems anxiety virus itself. you‚Äôre vaccinated little worry about.

Who think came term American Indian? I'm sure Gov. fully vaccinated too.  Yeah booster shot like bug-fix patch. though. 

People vaccinated still safe Delta. still effective. may need booster, going get seriously ill Covid. 

The reason parts country need wear masks highly vaccinated. course..those sections country believe masks either. something nasty August 2019. took 6 months feel near bad heart rate better. completely better now.

Chances elderly know way people tough time understand vulnerable. case death ratio change that. going hitting younger unvaccinated groups less severe outcomes.

So going forward statistics going change along predictive models. Cases might surge, deaths probably remain flat. easily 20 vaccinations life. really get people reluctant get them. need vaccine stupidity. guess, measuring immunity trial participants? Trials started year ago seeing immunity waning would warrant booster? got vaccine Spring 2021, probably okay right now, time goes would need booster? think rollout would signficantly faster homologous, manufacturing distribution may slow down.

Yes, certain situations modern world, best way sustain might make lethal. 1918 influenza deadly evolutionary pressures selected variants lethality global transport (only die soldier moved hospital).

Delta Variant: hold beer Yeah it‚Äôs really unevenly applied. Reasons? Refusal failure behalf government systems Black population areas? perfect us parents healthy kids can't vaccinated yet. give us nearly sterilizing immunity 6 months. Vaccines approved children time antibodies wane.  actually really GOOD idea. Insurance companies going take nose they're required cover ""long haulers"" insured. people refusing get vaccinated, lose insurance. month old, quote article says 0.5% Peru‚Äôs people died covid-19, toll worse recorded UK 1918-20 ‚ÄúSpanish‚Äù influenza pandemic.

Native American long ass time American natives First Nations Canada countries. That's sad first.

Im native one near wanted pull tooth for... drumroll please... cavity. 

Thank fuck got second opinion. want rip teeth instead of, know, fixing problem. second dentist flabbergasted repulsed actions. thought study came said creates b cell immunity could last long time. it‚Äôs 6 months? I‚Äôll take 99.98% chance survival without getting risk heart inflammation still getting covid, it‚Äôs own.    thanks two enough.

I'm boosters, moderna little rough. wonder side effects would better taken Pfizer. Either way, I'm glad over. Seems like places Right multiple studies suggested much higher efficacy. will. choose get immune 'traditional' way, choice. JFC. Hope wills. annoying already contingency plan vaccination, ICU occupancy active cases targets. 

They give us fixed date, sudden finding concepts vaccines summer vacations? think people would want answers future point? 

And I'm midly annoyed I'm closish border want go US side Champlain Lake. plan paid vacations work around visiting family side border, would freaking livid. Negotiated what. vaccine payed taxes. vaccine completely free

The negotiation probably guarantee everyone could get easily instead waiting list. glancing post first part sentence assumed said something American Indians hard time Covid cases infections. must say presently suprised read whole headline. least natives getting fucked much usual.   Idk I‚Äôm getting tested tomorrow got vaccinated may I‚Äôm deathly sick almost 10 days sign getting better. Feels 100% like covid earlier last year. 90% sure covid included First Nations? plan live it. Get vaccinated forget I'm happy delta variant first virus hit us. unprepared would screwed.  covid sure unvaccinated person Indian right answer lmao Developed world idea developing countries. 

Im country would surprised get 20% 2 years. world getting vaccinated.

Luckily vaccines really bloody good boosters, good covid got vaccinated. Don‚Äôt listen dumb ass people. need get vaccinated protect future variants. likely get flu shot every year different Crap. side effects exactly second Moderna ‚Äî 103 temp serious chills. I‚Äôll still get booster prepared high fever. Popsicles best friend chills stopped. basically Republicans, yeah, like said. need national lottery. get play register vaccination record social security number. offer stimulus checks vaccinated people. Carrots sticks effective winning people over. I‚Äôm sorry. lost family member. Immunity takes time develop, though, vaccines even requiring second dose. danger infected virus vaccination full immunity could give virus time adapt vaccinated person becomes able ""kill virus fast"".

Outside pandemic would rare. inside one difficult avoid contact virus. people get vaccinated social distance while. already know we're great that, apparently. Let's hope works differently time, though. missed getting annual shot decades sometimes new strain gets loose shot formulated.  lock downs US again. less idiots.  saw video back, White guy tries actuality culturally sensitive simply look culturally sensitive, helpful.   It‚Äôs right there:

Lawrence Gostin, Director World Heath Organization‚Äôs Collaborating Center National Global Health Law.

And, quick google yeilds:

‚Äú Professor Gostin center public policy law multiple epidemics AIDS SARS, Ebola, MERS, Zika. currently works closely Biden administration global institutions like WHO, World Bank, Gavi COVID-19 response‚Äù Originally Baltimore city planned mask restriction lifted 65% vaccination rate adults. 

That got scrapped real quick realized happen anytime soon, rest State either good vaccination rate simply care. Myocarditis happen immune response. People gotten bee sting - people even allergic bees.  right answer seems change every 8 years. wonder next time  lost many elders tribe members.  seeing extended family tribalism mixed religion. 

So many devoutly religious people feel current cultural changes taking place end making religious beliefs unacceptable society.  worried basic freedom worship attacked.  wrong.  

I believe country entering Post-Christian era separate outside political parties. religious cultural changes blamed Liberals, Socialists Democrats. conservative evangelicals feel fighting save way life.
 
The political divide lots spin it, core, religious war.  right believes fighting Satan. Yep Mine 6 months 2nd, said initially, miss-typed misinformation sources responsible untolled deaths.

They also responsible January 6th. sky up. Yeah definitely important. think point, govt manufacturers going err side over-protecting. people totally fine cellular immunity, think they‚Äôre going want jack many people‚Äôs circulating antibodies going fall/winter. future, relying cellular immunity kick probably become norm.  die out. lessened deadliness became annual flu.

I one dont want yearly covid season. absolutely rattles see stats ""First Native American _____"" headlines because, know, think there'd representation folks first? Absolutely ridiculous.

My father's worked tribes USDA years thrilled beyond words Haaland. Hope first many come high Australia, oddly. NSW get zero, state open borders people there. Totally agree. biggest anti-vax problem white Republicans.

To specific, White Republicans believe Pandemic plot Trump.  believe one tailored variants interest concern would helpful. virus mutates places learned lot mutations lead variants interest concern likely occur. Everyone vulnerable. *Expecto Precautio!!!* trust American europeans travel anywhere   red belt United States vaccination rates lower Northeast West Coast vaccinations met Biden Target 70% population. want in-depth discussion head r/Politics remember smallpox well Native Americans Canada essentially Americans treat blacks many poor suckers saying know side effects vaccine ""concerns"" surrounding vaccine. Literally listen patient today argue doctor. Like mfer, wanna find side effects actual virus!? Hell nah know cheaper? vaccine chose call Indians.

lmao serious? name given colonizers. asked called decided take name people country around world. White people live mostly white areas getting offended telling minorities don‚Äôt interact what‚Äôs best them. 

Speedy Gonzalos again. dunno, Plains usually say Indian (the slang spelling NDN), Native. Nobody time say Native American, nobody finds offensive.  Anyways first identification tribe(s) citizens of. Vodka? actually point out. still pretending India? Indian refer both. Sure mistake 500 years ago languages change enough people call something incorrectly long enough it‚Äôs accepted it‚Äôs longer incorrect. 

Have fun telling tribes reservations Indians. boat. I'm trying pay attention new Delta news comes potential booster shots can't deal anymore. constant news feeding clickbaiting articles make money pandemic....I can't.

I want information damn, exhausting. Look. vaccine. Covid deaths us still 300-400/day. colleague lost father mother covid. mother two shots - relatively young died Monday. friend heart issues vax. think it‚Äôs lies point. Even CDC backing away booster. don‚Äôt know believe. But. I‚Äôm pro athlete, I‚Äôm taking vax. risk dying covid. Zero. It‚Äôs individual preference experience. place it. It‚Äôs like tribe tells us ‚Äúthis enjoy called‚Äù follow lock step. use Native American, dad dad used Indian. others know use American Indian. There‚Äôs rhyme reason. article uses term, headline writer (who generally article writer) aware apparently distinction, connotation, Federal law.

""American Indians"" ""Alaska Natives"" distinct types Native Americans Federal law, thus Federal data collection like this. 

The subheader uses word Indigenous, although also includes Native Hawaiians Pacific Islanders, different groups altogether. Stares worriedly Minnesota neighboring states  We‚Äôre poking fun ridiculous English language, degrading group people.

Edit: see deleted comment me, anyone know happened there? Hmm Native Americans. American fucking Indians. New Zealand Native Americans didn‚Äôt mass domesticate live near animals didn‚Äôt immunities normal diseases spread livestock humans. 

Also don‚Äôt forget wars. Native Americans anywhere near monolithic believe. waring tribes. Think early republic Rome. 

Many suppressed tribes jumped foreign allies help fight enemy‚Äôs intermarriage seal alliances common. Singular they/them usually preferred pronouns non-binary people traditional gender identities. You‚Äôre fine. Like things, intent important aren‚Äôt malicious everyone know tribe wouldn‚Äôt even think twice it. said that, would never describe word ‚Äúindian‚Äù lol. fascinating worrying easily coronaviruses jump species. Republican tribalism Fox News new smallpox blanket. I‚Äôm ok this. Polish people kind stuck time Jan Pawe≈Ç II pope. know kind guy - banned contraceptives covered pedophile scandals. Polish church authorities can't stand Francis he's everything JPII is, basic level, pretty fine guy. seriously one concerns. wouldn‚Äôt feel safe eating one these. doubt much influence... FDR, Veeps even invited cabinet meetings, much less given important things do. Truman put National Security Council ascended presidency knowing single thing FDR mind. Nixon first VP preside cabinet meeting, LBJ first office near White House. Mondale frist office West Wing. Cheney,  


Even Curtis's time, Vice-President literally sat around waiting president die, except rare occasions Senate tie needed broken. first VP John Adams wrote wife ""complete insignificance"" office. One FDR's Veeps famously bitterly quipped vice presidency worth bucket warm piss (usually reprinted ""warm spit"").  


All say, Curtis high constitutionally, actual power influence.  member Tohono o'odham nation, approve message.  stupid. value vaccines presented statistics, anecdotes. way, training people recognise anecdotes valid way reach conclusions. 

Bad anecdotes partly fuels antivaxxers. going tell ""that's anecdote"" antivaxxer tells heard someone dying vaccine, using anecdotes show benefits vaccine? anecdotes face value.

An article could written people regret vaccine serious side effects would never get upvoted worthless anecdote. equal merit article. Use data, anecdotes. I'm NYC boy Luke combs got really good songs now. It‚Äôs also always one‚Äôs personal health. vaccine also reduce chances spreading covid vulnerable groups. Good getting first dose, said ‚Äúwhy would take vaccine‚Äù thought I‚Äôd correct Compared Australia New Zealand, bad. ‚ÄúA lot isn‚Äôt science. It‚Äôs political science,‚Äù said Dr. Isaac Bogoch, infectious disease professor University Toronto. ‚ÄúIf high rates community transmission Covid-19 high rates unvaccinated individuals, makes sense mask indoor scientific perspective. Whether converted policy different question.‚Äù 


The broken quotes article really reached.... final paragraph really sums bit honesty. 

I liked CNBC now. Bad reporting. Personally, ‚ÄúIndian‚Äù irks little reasons suggested, dad grandpa used word time. Shit, even tribal documents use it. can‚Äôt really fault anyone else it. could ask 10 people family word prefer called you‚Äôd get 12 different answers lol. recent study Singapore suggests vaccination provides pretty good protection severe Covid-19 disease Delta variant too. 
  
 
*A Singapore study found COVID-19 vaccination (Pfizer/Moderna) provides 69 per cent protection infection Delta variant coronavirus, regardless symptoms, Health Minister Ong Ye Kung said Wednesday (Jul 7).* 
 
*Citing study National Centre Infectious Diseases (NCID) Ministry Health (MOH), said data also showed vaccine's protection symptomatic disease ‚Äúbetween 80 90 per cent‚Äù.* 
 
*‚ÄúEffectiveness vaccination severe COVID-19 disease, requiring oxygen supplementation, ICU (intensive care unit) care death, 93 per cent,‚Äù added.* Agreed. live Southern state full vaccination rate 40% people masking anywhere. Although I‚Äôm fully vaccinated, care elderly mother immunocompromised, catch even mild breakthrough case Delta variant pass her, would certainly fatal. I‚Äôll continue mask public (and work) despite side-eye glances I‚Äôm getting. Well I've best friends native American entire life, part native American (barely) lived Indian reservation many years heard opposite obviously different person. Indian never acceptable lifetime area. Maybe different. like n-word something normal thing longass time. like calling someone oriental, weird offensive people. Feel free correct native American friends though, I""m sure know better culture. care link says, native Americans I've know entire life think opposite.  mah freedumbs!!! Cases per 100,000 people:

CA: 9,670

FL: 11,087

CA (longer) mask mandate compared FL

Data: telling 30% chance life altering consequences getting virus sufficient keep behind closed doors? think dont want son heart issues, lung issues brain damage thank you. downside? getting spend day son? share road shit drivers? dealing assholes insist telling us live lives affecting making anyone's life objectively worse? much problem adults get vaccinated though? verification method see immunization record individual states. takes days get, assuming state actually keeping track them. That‚Äôs coronavirus behaves. Many people confuse two different terms- virus bacteria. expertise matters. Access search engine comparable knowledge expertise. Experience knowledge needed expert. ‚Äúwe‚Äôre letting plagues spreading unfettered white people kill us again‚Äù Hahaha we‚Äôre going die religions rampant education sparse. real issue first world countries third world countries going last ones get vaccine going propagate probably going cause black plague version covid  agree. we've got thousands panicky people sub demanding new restrictions fresh mask mandates. Let mask want to, long let others right vaccinated maskless allowed choice too. Vaccines way out. They're infinitely effective masking. know sub obsessed masking vaccines. people done masks. Kind debunks narrative Donald supporters refused get vaccinated It‚Äôs much that. receipt received generated information stored covaxON, provincial vaccination database. Every dose tracked it‚Äôs possible validate records decide implement system. Can't wait shot number 8 come easter 2022. confusing. friends first-generation Americans whose families India, first thought talking community. problem, according headline (didn't read article) would could end variant outside vaccine range, go round 2. I'm surprised China donated any. 

They really gone hard soft power vaccine diplomacy places eyes on.  Like said, need wait dust settles really see numbers are. Israel one country reporting data would indicate efficacy much lower countries reported. Even efficacy 60% range, care almost exclusively serious illness rate, clearly vaccines effective preventing that. would curious know average symptoms breakthrough cases delta too, they‚Äôre runny nose headache couple days really cares end day. ‚ÄúI really regret unprotected sex prostitute getting genital herpes!‚Äù longer global growth broken various regions grows declines independently overall declines.   discounting experience heard podcast. I‚Äôm also black worked one poorest neighborhoods country urgent care setting. clinic‚Äôs population 99% POC. would say 7 10 black patients saw didn‚Äôt want get vaccine due skepticism. anyone walked covid test order complete chart would ask vaccinated. cannot tell many times people would laugh say weren‚Äôt going be. 

Maybe things changed last months since left job May, personally experience lot skepticism. flu vaccinated kids lethal.  Ye reread original comment realized weren‚Äôt referring vaccine hesitancy initial infection mortality rates. wish First Nation widely used US indigenous groups. like gravity.. ‚Äúwe first, mf‚Äù level gravity kids hospitalized COVID, adults option receive vaccine, would schools remote learning? 

We going learn live COVID like live flu, lice, peanut allergies, etc. Pretty sure would long haul symptoms too.. wonder people fact check responses writing them. Good them! think see way get stolen lands back White men stupid get vaccine. worked places like China, Hong Kong,New Zealand Vietnam. 

And seems working Taiwan Australia. province/territory in? I'm Ontario got email little receipt thing optional.  far new strains still respond vaccines. keep vaccinating masking hope reach herd immunity vaccines resistant strain mutates. Texas. bad allergies, unvaccinated toddlers, social anxiety, hate putting makeup. I'm usually person wearing mask indoors idgaf Good joke concept work actively seeking procurement  Canadians 35% double vaxxed. Things getting back normal. What's rush open borders messing up. wrong considered immune.   sucks live Midwest. I'm Illinois okay region Missouri makes feel ashamed. personally, family (indigenous grandmother adopted white children) people call whatever want, I'm critical others label them. America understand open it, Canada call first nation Indian get similar look said racial slur. feels gross say Good them.  Good community mindset good, compassionate leadership. I‚Äôm wearing mask behalf Indigenous people used often referring native people outside US. would also acceptable term applied US. Native, Indigenous, First Nations, Native American would preferable Indian considering Indian completely accurate exists dumbass explorers knowing landed. native people like reclaim term, like N-Word (though it‚Äôs necessarily slur). Even still, it‚Äôs normally natives. 

I‚Äôm personally native, girlfriend family are. Like California vs Florida? Oh, wait...  Thailand. 4% fully vaccinated 10,000 cases today. We're fucked. Australia would fine without countries creating Alpha, Beta Delta... got Moderna vaccine, would settle potentially less effective booster them? Pfizer's better Delta (or one available whatever reason) elect mix &amp; match? Well I'd asume culture actually appreciates elderly would. see mean. guess we'll find one way another, unfortunately. Without doubt. worried we'd see become subscription model. Influenza vaccine annually one thing, reaction first shot second shot ROUGH. Seeing 3rd shot vaccinators report strong reactions again... I'm hoping see peer reviewed studied entities conflicts interest. think scientific community expected waning antibodies wanted see memory B cell response limit severity infections time.

This vaccine saved many lives appreciate work scientific community, trust corporate community. Distribution also incredibly active ensuring people educated comfortable taking vaccine. think NPR piece work challenged months ago? quick Google resulted link  trying police thousands seperate indigenous groups across continent want call themselves? Seems especially weird even seem part community. feel sorry Tokyo. 

But cancel Olympics completely allowed hold 2024 2028. US? part? I've never heard Indian say indigenous people. don‚Äôt know exact vaccination rates Canada according [Indigenous Services 81% individuals aged 12+ received least 1 dose 55% received second dose. Yes. agree. taking issue idea vaccines increase *likelihood* variants emerging risk higher 50% vaccinated community.  


Variants emerge virus opportunity replicate. Every time replicates chance mutation. Hence, opportunities replicate, higher incidence mutation be.  


Now, likely vaccine-resistant variant would become dominant strain 50% people vaccinated *but* presence vaccines alone increase odds mutation. fact, every time virus can't get new host, loses chances replicate every lost chance replicate, odds mutations decreases. Question: gets approval, walk pharmacy get wait another version get distributed? gotten doses Pfizer back January would get booster right away becomes available. Yeah! final lap!  Indian common followed native experience. ""Native American"" almost always white people. What? Exactly. odds favour proper vaccine. Well I'm offended think trying make sound like was. based racism, reason use ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Haha joking, ""soviet"" Russian word council.   understand cases going means transmission, means risk infection, means long covid.

There‚Äôs dead alive.

Covid wrecks multiple organ systems. fully vaccinated, completely safe covid.

Efficacy covid could low 64% maybe high 88% symptomatic covid (for Delta variant). immune getting sick. get breakthrough cases nothing saying get moderately sick develop long haul covid chronic health effects infection (even mild). Look ""long haul covid"" aware is. 

Protection hospitalization death 90% still 100%. Also depends strong/weak someone's immune system is, got (if got months ago might fewer antibodies), areas lot unvaccinated people (ie. higher viral load). Living places high Indian populations I've never heard refer ""Native American"" unless political activists. actually pretty interesting me, since 3rd booster shot vaccine would mean drop-off vaccine efficacy seen recently places like Israel much Delta variant immune-evasive, natural decay vaccine's efficacy time. Look newest California mutation named Epsilon. feel like I‚Äôve seen enough interviews vaccine hesitant black Americans NYC, none said can‚Äôt get work scheduling. It‚Äôs conspiracy theories. got mine OKCIC fianc√© got opened friends family March. Except fire raging. 20k cases day nationally.  know interests (many times posted) story? Israel's Ministry Health tweeted they'd found big drop efficacy vaccine, provide much backup information figures much lower studies found. 

Not saying they're wrong (too early tell), approach find unusual, I'm used government organizations playing *up* vaccine effectiveness shedding doubt unless to, to, trying emphasize much possible vaccines still effective. know Israeli MoH's approach deliberate (maybe scare people taking precautions mini-wave) itchy Twitter finger. white man inflict covid them? Posted already think dumbasses get vaccine ever leave poor ass towns? ü§£ there's need throw personal attacks. he's *quite* correct, general sentiment right - smallpox blankets mythologized widespread, systematic technique accomplish genocide, truth appears isolated cases, possibly one.

From link: 

""For outrage account stirred years, there‚Äôs one clearly documented instance colonial attempt spread smallpox""

Maybe cool assume every single person different perspective contribute denying justifying genocide? still 2 bars. maybe need third shot?  Well agree everything said. Wish could upvote twice. Vaccine ID cards shouts rights, oppression. bad sports, concerts, universities airlines didn‚Äôt make mandatory entry. Card immunity proof required. Don‚Äôt like don‚Äôt participate. Screw them. can't build sympathy here. Strange see Telegraph taking negative angle. need held liable illness shuts schools. somebody link source natives disproportionately affected pandemic? understand infection mortality rates much higher them.  them. 

Vaccinated people still spread covid. 

Given contagious knowing vaccine immunity wanes time, ignore going act like covid make sense.

It also like forever. boosters future. Children able get vaccinated. may treatments long haul covid. world vaccinated future, vaccinated right now. Yeah, child growing Central/South Asia near India, confusing watching American TV hearing ""Indians"". personally try respectful, specific, mindful referring to. ways. Possible lie. Also likely piss pharmacist would need report errors like this. nice treat someone going depend COVID jabs foreseeable future. 

Why impatience? booster needed, say so. one dying that. super rare easy treat.

People die COVID. get serious lung damage. organ damage. serious mental effects (""brain fog"").

Vaccine absolutely indicated children. much damage Carrie Underwood allowed unleash us? keep getting away this? It‚Äôs completely absurd two rich island nations bottom word‚Ä¶ try 

China lying teeth we‚Äôll never know really went sure damage many many times claim. undoubtedly got control that‚Äôs easy human rights don‚Äôt hold back weld doors shut . 

Vietnam, Taiwan good example success know well can‚Äôt happen western nation . 
It‚Äôs shame won‚Äôt acknowledge Taiwan might know it‚Äôs understandable considering it‚Äôs totally role global health agency get involved political disputes ""applaude""

- fan shits table screen Anecdotally, notice many Americans strange fascination reverence Native Americans doesn‚Äôt seem exist parts North America. I‚Äôve personally heard lot racist remarks Indigenous peoples living Canada US. Fine that‚Äôs takes. i‚Äôm fully vaxxed people get decide they‚Äôre done kill people wasn‚Äôt point allowed give up? think anti vaxxers worth less old fucks die year anyway teachers pass vaccine, damn fools. Oh, thought meant Asian Indians. Oops. last time...*so far* need remote learning. Masks work effectively schools. effectively.

I wish government better coordinated 5-12 trials could schoolchildren vaccinated August, first day school walk in. Hey want to, governments fucking awful, wish able get vaccine... Yeah, travel pretty similar back too. Wtf. Sure let's too, really relevant whether restaurants put tables sidewalk Manhattan. make feel? ask you, fellow Americans, think minute. 

I feel betrayed. feel like adults charge acting like spoiled babies. 

I feel like raised lie America best every way possible. American exceptionalism indoctrinated believe. Seeing piss poor response total lack preparedness really opened eyes. powers know it. That‚Äôs push stupid culture war lies. 

They want us distracted. don‚Äôt want us reflect state nation. manufacture lies don‚Äôt open eyes see nation decline. Crumbling infrastructure. Mass homelessness. Drug addiction control. 

Despair. fear population full despair. could dangerous. wish people could come together demand change. side effects?

How smart enough get vaccine first place yet still dumb?

Stupid really spectrum. idea mentioned. Toddlers extremely low risk unless medically fragile. health problems, keep away grandma grandpa. Far away. (example: diabetes, lung issues) probably also called people trolls mentioned vaccine passports months back are. Would honestly surprised? mean many people fence probably wouldn‚Äôt continue getting shots.. Pfizer sees waning immunity Covid-19 vaccine, says developing new booster trying woke kinda way isn‚Äôt wild 2021 still call people ‚ÄòIndians‚Äô üòî long. September, we'll 5 12 approved, maybe November rest. Hopefully cases spike winter. would Indian-Americans Again, voluntary 3 year old can't vaxxed. live area I'm feeling pretty fucking doom n gloom days. got vax back April, adoption pretty low slow area feel like life going held hostage forever. Bleh.   read article vaccination rates North Shore 80-90% Harvey/Dixmoor sitting &lt;20%. going stuck BS least two years. Yes. He's right. unvaccinated America wear masks either. suck them. sympathy strong. God made April, country‚Äôs chief epidemiologist, Anders Tegnell, wrote email European Centre Disease Control (which happens based Stockholm), warning recommend use masks. reasoning ‚Äúimplies spread airborne‚Äù, would ‚Äúseriously harm communication trust‚Äù.

This evil now. July 8 appears 48 199 counties claimed &lt;1% death rate- Yemen seeing death rate per statista.com. deadly virus varies greatly - easily country isolate itself; medical infrastructure; widely people vaccinating (which correlates declining death rates). short, allowed run rampant, chance death rate 1% borne data prevaccine.


The rest conspiracy stuff speaks itself. article isn‚Äôt Canada done Canada irrelevant. tribe member (in US) Indian name yes, still used frequently habit. First Nations never used tribes state consider Native American American Indian acceptable. different mean countries. Yeah like said depends person saying person hearing suppose. Intent important Man big yikes. both? absolutely let vaxxed Europeans in. effing ridiculous non-vaxxed European enter travel Mexico Turkey two weeks before. There's logic this. first comment thread (and lot replies I've seen make others) comes across like they're telling wrong using term Indian accceptable term First Nations - seems like Canada thing? article seem concern Canada.

It's pretty obvious thread one term collective group people. read Twitter's disclaimer regarding blue checkmark accounts? Catholic like /respect Pope? tenent Catholicism God's spokesperson Earth? Unvaccinated America pay price. that, entire country paying much larger price years come. guess 50+ will. may need keep deaths low CDC recommendation even folks covid vaccinated, too. 

So tossing everyone past ~18 months ‚Äústrong immunity‚Äù category without vaccination seems kinda ‚Ä¶ unsound. Especially Delta.   I‚Äôd love see safety data point. second shot gave gold ball size lymphatic lump Armpit two weeks. fever/fatigue come back every two weeks (twice) well. feel like good deal US's decisions politics.  Topol questionable accuracy area. guy said working vaccine all.  get 4th 5th. I'm lmfao. enough enough

No one seriously suggested except troll replying to. Sure. presence vaccinated population increase odds mutation happening would infect vaccinated people. fact, decreases odds simply less opportunity virus replicate first place.  


Every host increases odds mutation arising. 


It's like virus playing lottery winning numbers vaccine resistance. host provides opportunity new ticket get filled out. hosts has, likely get winning combination. Take away hosts odds getting combination decrease. past decade services least Oklahoma drastically improved. large part due casinos Oklahoma. Growing 90s then, funding great. built hospital Ada made things area much better health coverage. still long waits.

I think large part run healthcare massive vaccine education programs signups even started vaccines available. Many ppl work healthcare Indian services natives themselves. Nope , many people diabetes co- existing conditions , lots people dying. know guy lost parents late 50s/ early 60s. 
It really tore places . 

There‚Äôs still plenty skepticism, small areas people know we‚Äôre losing friends family . blatant even skeptics least elderly take . incorporate booster flu shot get year? Lots people get those. Comparing personal protection device built vehicles something intended protect others probably helped set back compliance mandates. data indicating that. LATAM people (even young people) desperate get vaccine shot soon possible.  Indiana here. Vaccination rates pretty dismal. I‚Äôm pregnant I‚Äôve continued wear mask everywhere it‚Äôs really discouraging seeing people wearing masks anymore. I‚Äôm vaccinated (J&amp;J) I‚Äôm still worried getting covid pregnant.  Hospitalizations always going go life gets back ""normal."" matter a) overwhelm hospitals b) what's number deaths people willing accept. Morbid true. yes, people fully vaxxed well. hate idea fully vaxxed people can't get COVID die. much less cases I'm kind fed news freaking boomer parents randomly happens. People need learn respect personal choice. want vaccine get vaccine. It‚Äôs decide what‚Äôs wrong body.   Sorry hear. living Bangkok 2019. left months initial covid outbreak. 

I unfinished business Thailand, can't get back due travel restrictions. think happen time soon. either, definitely sucks commission days. Since June 8th UK fully vacinated people USA.  That's great, lot tribes odd still call every native American that.

edit: keyword ""some"" all. post feels like TIL lot people know American Indians preferred term Native Americans within tribes. Oh agree completely. reason vaccine hesitancy it‚Äôs due fact black people easily mislead it‚Äôs ‚Äúall conspiracies‚Äù one responder oh eloquently put. 

I understand hesitancy it‚Äôs fault institutions. I‚Äôm entirely sure combat that. I‚Äôve discussions patients fruitless. Everything documented check records. FDA approves CDC says ok get third dose, considered fully vaccinated 2 doses give third one asking. want lose job license. Interesting I've lived Midwest west larger populations Indian/native/indigenous people. almost always refer Indian native offended it. Canada know frowned upon along Eskimo erroneously thought offensive. Indian also offensive white people offended others. pretty solid video certain point you‚Äôve got recognize everyone level acceptable risk. 

It wasn‚Äôt cool wear masks last fall protection virus. now. vaccines 100% effective delta variant?No. never never be. situation facing right situation facing forever. Covid never leaving, even vaccination run small risk contracting it, smaller risk getting ill, even smaller risk getting long covid. 

For people, ditching masks going back normal, pre pandemic life absolutely worth small risk. don‚Äôt think demonized that. They‚Äôve done part. kidding, right? Native Americans abysmal access quality healthcare never thought ability prevent unknowingly infected individuals spreading it.

Also keep mind sub like politics low quality information; post downvoted removed criticizing AZ vaccine. Germany pretty much requires get tested fully vaxxed go clubbing, Netherlands same?  Yes, CNN reported Pfizer starting EUA process. Technically could probably get one now, depending giving shot but. sure get 80% number high 40s vaccinated. Rest say they‚Äôve covid natural immunity, according article, putting 80%. don‚Äôt count way Oregon‚Ä¶ count percentage completed immunization. No, military straight can't require emergency authorization. There's round-about way, possible. get proper approval, certainly mandate Heads download vaccine receipt Ontario's Covid Vaccination site. Ministry Health watermark it, email copy They‚Äôre basing levels antibodies, hasn‚Äôt enough time study effectiveness memory B-cells.

Praise biology! hope nobody listens ""experts"". jfc optics going fucking terrible delta running around going absolute shit show. Canada used strategy. Younger vaccinated around early/mid-June June. speeded got vaccine stock maybe around 2 months ago around 40-45 yo. Absolutely disgusting - father, disgusted. ‚ÄúAt time‚Äù. 80% common sense think three seconds. Obviously vaccinated, better. need study know that. outside inside cuz kind makes difference cuz sides though black lives matter protests America also January 6th insurrection. little cases covid spread groups they're outdoors right Native Americans !!! is. Pandemics leave orphans usually. something brought year ago, part makes Covid denial infuriating me. tests lack week behind infections, guess happens next week. weekend people still party like June 29th. Epsilon variant: Legend. couple things.

1) Even Pfizer quoted news article saying vaccine continues 95%+ effective severe disease antibody levels drop. would suggest significant long-lasting protection vaccine presumably coming memory cells.

2) Reports booster trials seem suggest much higher level minor side effects fever third dose, compared second. consistent body recognising covid spike protein (presumably memory cells) rapidly launching stronger immune defense it.

To understanding, memory cell action bit delayed compared action circulating antibodies. means complete protection infection less likely sort long term immunity. However, still ramp antibody production time prevent large viral concentrations body lead high infectiousness severe illness. Hence would expect memory cells substantially reduce onward transmission severe disease medium (or long) term, even circulating antibody levels fall. American travel Europe fake vaccine card would imply person:

- anti-vaxxer (considering vaccine available anyone wants US)

- Wants travel Europe 

- smart enough able get fake card dumb enough risk getting caught going prison vacation 

How many people like exist? I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôre doubt there‚Äôre enough problem anyone.  worth noting initial skepticism among black people seems largely evaporated community leaders people trust said ""this good stuff, go get it."" think happened bit quicker Native community. So? still almost 100% stopping death. Well‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Darwin. confusing also Americans Indian descent tell two communities apart? something deathly Ebola became transmissible COVID-19 would‚Äôve much bigger problems ethics morality compulsory vaccinations. Society would‚Äôve probably collapsed time vaccine came out. call Americans Indian roots India then? Thankfully, UK high uptake (close 90%) unvaccinated cause problems. ya can‚Äôt travel internationally, attend big events, get reasonably priced health insurance, don‚Äôt need force anyone motivation matter created life saving vaccine it? respect personal decision? healthcare workers got vaxxed January? There's quite them.  I'm vaccinated still wear masks inside. ...that seems obvious hindsight. someone works reservation say first hand one first receive vaccine, included. said, initial hesitancy among populous receive it.

Thank you. cancer time covid awful, meaning delayed testing treatment. add attitude found Reddit 'cancer contagious ' 'you wait 'at least dying covid'......

Reading long covid, people complaining side effects vaccine day two, really puts dealing perspective.

I know may want hear it, risk laid one I'm willing take wear masks (Not like close 100% make invincible either). I'm illusion I'm invincible. I'm human get sick I'm unlucky worse. That's life. take extreme measures last year little community immunity letting virus spread uncontrolled would overwhelmed hospitals caused deaths far beyond virus would cause. vaccines US completely change equation. I‚Äôm telling won‚Äôt. wasn‚Äôt question anyway. agree question let plane pretty much.   Youll still highly protected severe COVID REDUCE ability transmit virus since memory cell response robust, community level- highly vaccinated- virus lose lot steam even starts infecting vaccinated people.

I dont think restrictions needed. southern states going herd immunity old fashion way, northern states likely see surge hospitalizations due high vaccination rate. That's think important give doses could used boosters rest world. Boost risk dying risk transmitting virus high risk US. rest goes vaccinated countries save lives lower risk variant coming along severely reduces effectiveness vaccines. 

Im layman, though, opinion taken grain salt like reddit opinion. Hey friend, me. work school extra immunity would great. 

My concern mainly around rest people yet get single shot given information may need three. kid People won‚Äôt ‚Äújust wearing masks‚Äù portion year forever.

Obviously cancer bad, doubt many ailments get close pain suffering caused Cancer  also don‚Äôt appreciate often lock threads. lot time seems unnecessary. Vaccines produce stronger lasting antibody response, yes.  You‚Äôre going lead next fight heart disease, stroke, diabetes, high blood pressure obesity right?

It‚Äôs almost like someone used disease weapon try wipe out. moderators part problem, letting news articles censoring others regardless accurate information content wait till 5 minute antibody test trust verify liberty loving lunatics didn‚Äôt get jabs. look forward borders less backed lol   They're back masking facing lockdowns again. 1.

2. vaccines protect 100% infection transmission. I‚Äôm vaccinated wear mask stores crowds genuinely care others wish harm anyone, even views differ mine. would devastated spread virus anyone, even though chance relatively low.

It‚Äôs absurd really. cares much hospitalizations also care walking around covid inevitably get thanks waning vaccine. 

I don‚Äôt know single person, including myself, would bother covid testing headache runny nose (delta symptoms). unvaccinated immunocompromised fare walking around maskless vaccination rates less 40%? Seems like lot hospitalizations. state isn‚Äôt state. decide state based states situation? weren‚Äôt vaccinated. tell post. Alcoholism drug addiction oppression.  You‚Äôve never reservation have, you‚Äôre blind. empathize. wife refusing.  I'm sure do.  Republicans rather please trump anti vax supporters putting every gop supporter risk death, help live another day cast vote them. Maybe want rigged elections. know lot die making new laws help shrinking numbers. bottom guys. They're actually right sense. people vaxxed late March-early April. antibodies wane 6 months like Pfizer saying, majority Americans going safe infection fall. course, protection severe COVID lasts longer that, possibly much longer, what's end goal here? continue boost immunity every 6 months reduce spread, content hospitals overwhelmed virus spreading?

The world desperate need vaccines, there's higher risk creating variant severely reduce effectiveness vaccines countries severely vaccinated. What's status FDA approval vaccinations?  happen eventually. government (in Australia) bungled rollout really badly. We've hit 10% mark (for fully vaccinated Australians 16).

And business get Pfizer get AZ. everyone scared AZ giving blood clots messaging lately really confusing. vaccines people immune dysfunction can‚Äôt get typically weakened ‚Äúlive‚Äù virus ones. would mRNA technique used across influenza strains. So, active replicating virus. mean offered vaccine. suppose there's tons people can't get vaccine even wanted to. Janssen AZ based Adenovirus. vector adenovirus. also use Native American work lot Indians India, consider *them* Indian Americans. two groups called Indian American, confusing. curiosity, boss father law vaccinated? mean that‚Äôs vaccinations work. protected exponentially got vaccinated. Would nice sterilizing antibody levels forever? Yeah, sure. can‚Äôt expect get booster every couple months maintain peak levels. You‚Äôre well protected everything. people likely retain sufficient antibody levels many months maybe even year more. cellular immunity would kick become infected clear infection becomes severe, keep viral load low, reduces chance spreading.

Could catch it? Sure. it‚Äôs likely. did, probably won‚Äôt know it. do, probably won‚Äôt bad. is, probably won‚Äôt need hospitalized. are, probably won‚Äôt die.

At point need start looking like common diseases, which, vaccinated people, is.

All said, I‚Äôll gladly take third dose if/when offered! It‚Äôs something worry heavily right now, especially relatively low risk person first place, sounds like well.  immunocompromised often choice. kids 12 right now. cannot always isolate. It‚Äôs sobering realize half ‚Äúadults‚Äù refuse get vaccinated selfish and/or idiotic reasons, putting everyone (especially vulnerable) higher risk, mention increasing chances new variants emerging. FFS. Amazing. 

Someone picked something subtle. 

Yes, grandkids look us like insane calling black people 'Black'. put ‚Äú/s‚Äù end truth? /s It‚Äôs name, DOB, brand vaccine, date vaccination, Batch number place vaccination. combination ID check verification via database certificate real, think it‚Äôs pretty idiot proof.

Do mean ""report"" doctor/vaccine vigilance system prompted directly?

Because side effects (sore arm fatigue) bother reporting since they're already well known. sure conservative? may liberal aware. None personal health problems affect people. Spreading covid kill people. think need increase research preventing things tenfold considering obesity contagious see reason restrict person's diet access public settings. comparison makes 0 sense actually care things listed using whataboutism. Also fun fact covid actually cause half things list.   Unfortunately agree this. hard get Americans revert back Covid protocols, especially masks. still wear mine many people it.  You‚Äôre trying simplify huge group stereotype make bad faith arguments group whole rather individually engage people.

Or god forbid, try make actual point rather attacking straw man created. Strawman. 
My question 'close collapse'.   comment meant response first guy. says hospitalization low‚Ä¶which true, overall cases. extreme case growth things could become quiet bad short amount time. even comparable? 

Masks something people get store online time, buy bulk store anywhere house. forget great toilet paper hoarding March 2020?

You can‚Äôt run store stock vaccines keep fridge. 

It‚Äôs two completely different scenarios. I'd ask help make better rather shit ""uneducated"".

Please watch video. Exactly. forget clinics sent body bags instead PPE requested battle Covid.

Somehow never heard year plus isolation. alone one point news triggering quit ingesting it, paying attention loss Indigenous lives.

That's disgusting.

I'm sorry lost family tribe members. what's end goal here?

Since ""flatten curve"" clear public health goal one clearly identify used guide policy. almost entirely unvaccinated.  ask FDA authorize booster dose COVID vaccine Delta variant YORK, July 8 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc plans ask U.S. regulators authorize booster dose COVID-19 vaccine within next month, drugmaker's top scientist said Thursday, based evidence greater risk reinfection six months inoculation spread highly contagious Delta Chief Scientific Officer Mikael Dolsten said recently reported dip vaccine's effectiveness Israel mostly due infections people vaccinated January February. country's health ministry said vaccine effectiveness preventing infection symptomatic disease fell 64% June. It‚Äôs job (and interest financially) continue staying top virus‚Äôs evolution order prevent sort real breakthrough. Current vaccines still extremely effective. boosters preemptive measure order continue strengthen neutralization moving forward.  Eh, specific charge... evidence iffy. 

However, colonizers things genocide American Indian. it‚Äôs bit moot point. It‚Äôs like asking ‚Äúdid colonizers use .22 caliber bullets kill Indians? Well, maybe... certainly used calibers‚Äù  well Israel's prior peak periods.

It's largely irrelevant whether they're low not. 

The vaccines designed stop cases, they're designed stop mass death hospitalization. long continue that, restrictions needed. likely business necessity boosters.

Does mean want sell third dose even really necessary? Consistency - vaccines much consistent response generate.

Some people make enough right kind response virus, almost everyone get vaccine. Orrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr get vaccinated get lame version spicy cold.  ""experts"" lol like Adam Finn? agenda, people want go forever, likely financial reasons. experts probably shares multiple private testing companies.  people still call that, they're india people going gatherings.

Why 12 avoiding summer activities, chances ending hospital probably around vaccinated older person. masks restrictions highly vaccinated states countries, high vaccination US states ended them.

We KNEW cases would rise re-opening sub treats like huge surprise.

The vaccines never stop cases, stop mass death hospitalization. Firstly, yes coming month. announced previously would ramping million week latter half July. never said additional jabs, million week coming.

So finish vaccine rollout Feb? living dreamland. country able that. people feel bad morons kids. people going go far. might ignore vaccine rule grocery store, someone checking cards(or even asking status) honest. think lockdown overkill well-vaccinated country, ""cases still incredibly low"" holds long. 

As recently June 10 (less month ago), virtually case: 15 day average, less 5 community spread (the others detected border). Within 30 days, cases increased 400 day - almost community spread. went 5 cases day 400 - 80X increase - less month. That's doubling period 5 days. 

These things eventually peter myriad reasons (the UK shows signs leveling well), naive extrapolation rate shows 3200 cases day two weeks. That's well Israel's prior peak periods. 

That said, impact significantly lessened due vaccines. ""cases still incredibly low"" silly say something showing incredibly rapid exponential spread. thought free people making money? I‚Äôm growing frustrated discouraged everyday this. part, got doses, wore mask, followed guidelines still mask large public gatherings yet hear everyday might need booster shot every year stay protected Covid Delta etc‚Ä¶it‚Äôs exhausting. I‚Äôm starting think going normal rest lives know? Like may never actually escape threat Covid, Delta, whatever else comes it. Sorry, vent minute That's dumb. Dumb denying virus.

They're necessary yet. are, fine, bother me.

You really seem feel like ""dunking"" me, I'm curious feel need.

Mild-moderate acute stage. 15% reported moderate severe symptoms months post infection.

If covid taught anything one size fits solution; comes personal evaluation risk. work year everyone colorado chance vaccinated, blame them. realize society work ""personal choices"".

You realize laws rules place right?

All would go whole concept ""personal choice"".

But that's happens live fucking society.

Get head ass, actions drastic consequences rest society, choice anymore. Please consider wearing n95s mask already. They're back stock days! Divided Covid restrictions makes sense political division though... expect liberal leaning governments want government control situation conservative governments want leave market customers make choices typical..

The vaccine thing different. Long covid actually rare people think. 50% people aged 16-30 experience mild covid symptoms experience long covid least 6 months. people know use freezers food. shortages damn good reason go out, pretty useful.  kind history white people passing deadly viruses onto them, shocked read this.

We're fully vaccinated tired this. vaccines offer sterilizing immunity. isn‚Äôt one them, unfortunately. told solved problem via boosters. It‚Äôs like live waning shots. 

A low vax area Florida means I‚Äôm likely get it. means I‚Äôll bring infection unvaccinated immunocompromised family members, coworkers, friends. know I‚Äôm infected, I‚Äôll also need inform people, quarantine, miss work, etc. That‚Äôs expensive frightening people around me. go this? 

I‚Äôm saying booster mandatory. I‚Äôm saying people want continue enjoy protection *infection* allowed so.

It‚Äôs idea might barred taking booster someone else comfortable getting covid lives high vax area fully vaccinated family, friends, coworkers, etc. concerning here. 

America never one size fits all, don‚Äôt see different. Maybe timing cases, maybe contact tracing. 100% certain though. No, choice.

Obviously nurses health care workers take flu shot, COVID could different animal multiple ways. invaluable. filled meats perishables didn‚Äôt run store almost anything. literally pulled data dates mentioned. numbers are‚Ä¶a fact. disagree methodology that‚Äôs different story, deaths per case order magnitude (at least) lower vaccines. 

Vaccine r√©sistent strains concern, don‚Äôt see epidemiologist saying likely thing given current vaccination rates.  disagree point. important realize still idea long term effects it. 

I went vax family incomplete chunk. something that's 'living' poking around bodies looking vulnerabilities. Yes, 2% American doctors antivax, still huge problem medical establishment. certainly decreases trust doctors. impressive immune response data referencing anecdotal experience, something you‚Äôve heard study director something? Agreed realize sheer fuck millions people dying prematurely going thru health crisis wrong. mother would constantly pressure get flu vaccine every year suddenly doesn‚Äôt want COVID vaccine. Even though year flu vaccine reformulated. Yes tech different however kidding self think anything self getting vaccine. Ur making worse everyone around concerned slight chance ur going die something. Ur likely deal long term health consequences COVID ur tight ur body temple bull crap. Covid around 1.5 years, seem much firm evidence lots kids suffering long term effects. worried kid early pandemic, point, think we've enough time feel okay it. clearly health agencies (CDC example) worried it, either. think saw clear signs dramatic long Covid effects kids opening up, rolling back restrictions, etc.? Well, shred normalcy fun lasted. bad feeling winter gonna another huge surge. seem lethal, no.  anything, symptoms mild - runny nose headache. open antelope canyon now? saw mini doc YouTube, maybe CGPGrey, many reservations term Indian prefered. remember exactly reasons were: Indian use longest become identity, Native American Amerindian seem patronizing / put colonizer's name title (American / Amerigo), Indian shows distinctly unique American culture. Really interesting stuff. common sense instead AntiVaxxers collective stupidity forces society.  Cats susceptible. 48% Americans fully vaccinated. 

The undervaxxed unvaxxed still problematic.

The pandemic isn‚Äôt over. Could always join satanic church correct would hard tell, like parents signing children rounding age year two form. 

From read, yeah there's lot conflicting studies, antibody counts may wane expected 6 months there's conclusive case mild drop, severe drop (no numbers released know), antibody level even required prevent infection kinda hard study can't ethically infect people science. Antibodies part immune response pieces memory cells appear still holding well. 

I guess comes purpose vaccine -- prevent most/all infections keeping antibody counts high means frequent boosters prevents most/all hospitalizations deaths none mild symptoms already works 2 doses. That's expertise say, I'm engineer. CDC said yesterday time booster recommended. 

There anecdotal evidence time receive another mrna booster side effects get worse worse stimulating immune system again. That's trade -- many active antibodies person realistically need vs potential adverse reactions unknown effects giving boosters every 6-12 months what, year, 2 years, 5 years? american indian indian american severity Delta even subject article/quote. basically discussing often vaccinated people transmitting strain virus. headline Fauci suggesting case. ‚ÄúVaccines reduce chances people getting Long Covid, reducing risk seriously debilitating symptoms also reducing chances infection lasting three months."" Makes sense. mostly remember TP canned goods shortage. guess frozen foods sold too.   American Medical Association (AMA) today released new survey (PDF) among practicing physicians shows 96 percent surveyed U.S. physicians fully vaccinated COVID-19, significant difference vaccination rates across regions. physicians yet vaccinated, additional 45 percent plan get vaccinated.

If math right 2% doctors vaxxed plan getting it. I'd love know two percent. 1. Kids 12 low risk group. Influenza many mundane activities partake likely COVID kill them,
2. unlikely event vaccinated individual spreads virus someone causes become seriously ill, infected individual likely vaccinated chose fate. 
3. Masks straight jackets annoying uncomfortable times. really want workout mask again. also many social engagements ruin. called native Americans. Calling them

Fauci guessing using experience. ZERO evidence yet ZERO evidence Delta leading sicker people deaths, Fauci made clear yesterday too. said FEASABLE could. data yet. Nuance hard Americans days unfortunately.  47.5%  nurse lose job. still catch spread covid vaccinated. vaccinated not, according aSyMpoMaTiC SpReAd, spreading covid. someone working healthcare closely vaccines, see two reasons.

1. Vaccines technically FDA approved. Requiring unapproved vaccine weird legal grey-area. court cases rulings regarding may set legal precedent, hospitals want sued.

2. Staffing. hospitals wildly understaffed right (our hospital ~100 open RN positions right now). know several people small world would 100% quit vaccine mandatory institution, ridiculous sounds, department high vaccination rate. would wind losing lot nurses already understaffed.

Both combined mean hospital, benefits outweigh risks. already saw literally zero patient-to-nurse nurse-to-patient transmission Pre-vaccine preventative policies, lose staff face legal action? saying people right live life zero risk contagious disease? That's bold right suggest one likely impossible achieve quest achieving would annihilate civil society well know it. Can‚Äôt force medical treatment. always taught sickest place go hospital.  avoid going so.  get additional illnesses like C Diff , MRSA etc. Shit, I'm cool getting booster, can't hurt. document interesting read. Ok, thanks country getting hit hard right now, average person still refuses mask up, maintain social distancing stay home. 30% covid tests positive today. strict lockdown week government take help police, army border guard still can't get people stay home. 1,000 people arrested yesterday city violating stay-at-home orders. hate people times. Vaccinating immunocompromised person like giving shield barely lift. Ugh...right?! üò´üò´üò´ pull names, Abbott helped lick, quite oppositeü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è may argue vaccinations compulsory, fact remains democracies world currently leaving individual, luckily good uptakes places. 

I‚Äôm getting second shot 2 weeks encourage everyone know get jab (and frankly don‚Äôt know anyone doesn‚Äôt plan to) getting fine less-industrialized society colonizers.

Actually, way American children learn history, westward expansion makes look like industrialization happened lot later simply settlers living ""primitive"" technology railroads caught them. still get around getting it. least thats say Social Media Except ""personal"" decision puts others risk. rights end infringe someone else's  I‚Äôm misusing word fallacious. views Pfizer motives alone qualify. don‚Äôt know high probability. certainly don‚Äôt source that. percentage always going get vaccinated. question whether still reach herd immunity without them.

I‚Äôm saying sue anything would definitely reach hospital let know isn‚Äôt acceptable. First, isn‚Äôt true. Hospitalizations starting rise within NHS system. It‚Äôs determined see subsequent increase deaths. 

Secondly, uncontrolled viral spread lead opportunities antibody escape variants develop render high vaccination. Rates meaningless. Report Patient Advocacy department. Report them, Uhm small government? leaving choice people want wear mask not. saying agree ideology seem ""small govt"" alternative. We're experiment Netherlands, recently stopped countermeasures coronaspread except vaccination.

Obesity contagious, walk store restaurant bar obese that's end it. walk infected COVID, highly likely potential vector spread others ten-fold. That's mask mandates lockdowns obesity things mentioned; personal issues deserve help support, they're individual issues alone, infectious disease. looking death toll ignoring part death toll connected contracting COVID got someone else. whole ""your fist stops nose"" thing, infectious disease connects fist other's nose. line, mass vaccinations started happening march, 4 months lots people vaccinated == almost 300k deaths. not. Indians? thought kinda messed call Indian they're Native Americans? thought referencing Indians, India, live America. Guys calling ppl idiots stupid getting vaxxed isn‚Äôt making get it. Idk anyone‚Äôs realized yet orrrrr.... I'm pro-vaccine anti-mask, kind weird situation - people assume folks either pro- anti- interventions.  

The studies done last 16 months clearly show little effect transmission rates masks worn. Cloth masks particular terribly effective even lab testing standardized conditions, real world use community appear real population-level benefit.  worst, give vulnerable people false sense security.  Knowing this, really chapped hide kids forced spend 8-9 hours day mask school obvious anything meaningful protect others.  

Vaccines, hand, *are* highly effective.  protect individual far better mask, people vaccinated knocks transmission chains community, protects unvaccinated (whether choice circumstance).  literally definition herd immunity. Native American also fine, usually indigenous people preferred many includes indigenous people Latin America/Canada United States I've also heard ""First Nation"" television programs specifically them, assume that's also acceptable. Man Austin Early April exactly 2 weeks getting second vaccine full craziness. Packed bar packed bar. never seen many packed bars life. mask seen anywhere. People dancing next strangers. sure vast majority weren‚Äôt vaccinated. people haven‚Äôt Austin won‚Äôt know talking about. two streets many huge bars. good... also looked Vermont's total population, 623K people size larger counties Texas. low numbers expected, proves well vaccines work. county Texas 255K people we're 33% fully vaccinated last Friday (reports week) still seeing 10 cases day 0-1 deaths week bad considering. foresee going way today's numbers come thanks Delta like 95% wearing masks following social distancing.

If think that's fear mongering, issue OP. Europe still supply constrained.  Yeah, sorta learned lesson whole smallpox thing. know particularly significant objection term USA, thing find frustrating term ""Indian"" ""American Indian"" ridiculously ambiguous is.

It also leads slightly ridiculous situation ""American Indians"" ""Indian Americans"", two completely different groups vastly different origins, referred ""Indian"".

Then again, guess problem even exists word ""American"", guess USA best relationship decent naming conventions.   I'LL TELL I'VE ENOUGH  Personally, fan this. Feels like service Pfizer CEOs premature comments (months ago) booster needed. vaccine fantastic, can't focus getting available whole world? 

It also says they're working modified vaccine delta. get third dose better wait that? Given existing first run shots still great Delta variant, surprised booster necessary first two shots. Obviously studies ongoing, possible booster may recommended mostly elderly greater risk hospitalization death otherwise. really pleased see UK go ahead full reopening. course bares risk backfiring, also reasonably high likelihood showing world vaccinated societies function normally even cases increasing. focus antibodies, effectiveness wanes quickly anyway. long term protection comes memory cells (T-cells).

There's also tiny, real, risk developing potentially severe side effect like myocarditis booster shot, workable strategy keep mandating shots every year.

And devil's advocate second, good data vaccine side effects either. Myo- pericarditis confirmed potential side effect today. may still others take longer present symptoms. like ""long covid"" presented infection, ""long side effects"" vaccine may coming. would Indian American.

""Innovative yet vetted."" county, we‚Äôre still behind vaccinations: 38 percent total population completed vaccination series 47 percent total population least one dose (61 percent adults 80 percent age 65 years). previous infections partial vaccinations provide level protection, evidence suggests full vaccinations effective way stay safe delta variant.

So 46.6 vaccinated number lie - that's *single dose* county. 38% total population fully vaccinated.

And lastly, here's **How got here** *(italics calculations used measure heard immunity track (*yes fucking moron write ""heard"")* individual level data vaccinations administered COVID test results since beginning pandemic. infected, yet tested 4x Adjusted Incidence Rate Ratio [AIRR] adult population 5x pediatric group based national local seroprevalence data. model also calculates overlap 28 percent vaccinated population Dallas estimated prior COVID-19 infection recovered.

Sounds like they're taking positive tests local population multiplying x4, x5 kids, ""estimating COVID-19 recovered.""

Man, kinds shit wrong shit. guys collectively pat back. I'm little confused isolation recommendation right now. wife vaccinated, symptoms starting last Sunday (June 27) tested positive (after false negative) last Tuesday, quarantine ended Wednesday. started getting symptoms last Tuesday (June 29) tested negative past Wednesday. Based symptoms, I'm fairly sure false negative symptoms much mild guess I'm sure.

&amp;#x200B;

So there's conflicting recommendations know trumps what. Obviously home wife, [caring someone section says isolate 14 days quarantine ends since tested negative, rather going start symptoms. [fully vaccinated says isolate I've come contact someone COVID. Obviously I'll least isolate symptoms, I'm sure do. 2 week difference makes substantial difference pick daughter Tuesday not. do? friend works nursing school TX (I know, shocker there) number students bind coming fall semester refuse get COVID-vaccinated, classes require work settings COVID vaccinations required. Even amongst supposedly well-educated health care force, politics reign supreme science. would sue happened. Translation: angry can‚Äôt bigots anymore. There's way dont spread .. earth they? comment threads reddit like one! Absolutely. 

You see sub people still terrified despite fully vaccinated. 

I much suspect high-vax states will, inexplicably, implement new restrictions soon people panic rising cases.

(For record, UK's case growth already slowed despite Delta + near fully re-opening. see governors able hold nerve.) even believe COVID Except poster described sick people were.  I'm guessing Delta still pretty transmissible even wearing masks? Assuming Delta what's hitting SK now. 

Herd immunity way ends, wish people willing get immunity vaccination rather hoping they'll mild course disease. sticking point willing consider ""primitive"". Preindustrial quite ring bell me. ridiculous. Karens flooding school board meetings make masks personal choice It‚Äôs necessarily anti vaxxer nut jobs aren‚Äôt taking vaccine.

Lots people sub want isolation world last years masks small children optional Fascinating read. Thanks share! interesting character sure. COVID related incident wear mask (at least allowed there) following two days. would things would make wife say WTF everytime walked room. 
Our nurse good came COVID protocols, care less getting wife medicine ordered checking vitals basic care would expect. think example badly COVID impacted Healthcare system. inlaws work hospital administration (not hospital) said hospitals throwing outrageous amounts money anyone convince work. That's happening everywhere, Texas schools. America rethinking rat race.

That excellent point never considered before. Thank you. appreciate answer. Outside immunity, curious Spreading it... difference vaccinated person's ability spread unvaccinated person natural immunity?  That‚Äôs excuse they‚Äôre giving right many find new reason get shot get full approval. don‚Äôt know that‚Äôs bonafide fact yes, would seemingly tough mutate much immune systems don‚Äôt recognize still able attach cells infect us. would basically completely different virus point.

""Oh bless heart think going end locked harder low-vax states winter.""

This you, right? Nice  Long-term effects turning common. study published June journal Nature Medicine looked 300 patients Bergen, Norway‚Äîalmost patients diagnosed city several months 2020. Six months initial diagnosis, 61 percent group persistent symptoms. common problem fatigue, followed difficulty concentrating, disturbed smell taste, memory trouble difficulty Since testing positive COVID December 10, 2020, 47-year-old Sherry Flynn Goldsboro, N.C., plagued long list ailments, including severe fatigue, blood clots, chronic headaches, rapid heart rate, general body pain, trouble thinking remembering, type 2 diabetes. accumulated shelf filled prescription medicines. two months post-diagnosis, Flynn‚Äôs primary care physician referred recently opened facility: COVID Recovery Clinic University North Carolina Chapel Hill (UNC) School Medicine. ‚ÄúShe said, ‚ÄòI treat symptoms, believe could maybe find ways help rehabilitate instead putting medications,‚Äô‚Äù Flynn Like Flynn, patient hoped find, cure, least reprieve myriad symptoms afflicted months wake COVID diagnosis. no. Agreed get lot neurotic parents saying need mask children Tech ppl move in.. non tech ppl move  patient contact require masks. means Fire Dept, ambulance, hospital, old folks homes wearing it. work outside, dedicated demographic still wear it. report simply right thing do, preventing Delta Dawn ... l always enjoyed song. something worry talking permanently adopting new habits constant disinfection, wearing masks forever even sick, etc. immune systems need exercise best. 

If put bubble, even imperfect one, probably avoid getting lot illnesses take granted regular occurrences, seems great. *something* make eventually, immune system used challenged, may end worse.

I'm scientist doctor, I'm perfectly willing hear contradictory data, I'm going seems like common sense. :) ‚ÄúThe hospital put blast person fired ask me‚Äù

And high quality information 55.2 received 1+ dose . number goes less final statistic headed Wait, playing Devil's advocate seriously getting vaccine? latter, why? I've never heard good argument.

My right risk infected entirely preventable illness due ignorance / laziness/ seflishness/ stubborness. Pick one.

MSG. I‚Äôm going Cincinnati July(outdoors). going take kids (10 8) they‚Äôre vaccinated, I‚Äôm selling tickets. Bummed I‚Äôd rather risk getting sick. always find interesting ""real world data"" never seems come source. via faux news site cites six cases evidence. 

If statistically significant, peer reviewed, published via proper channels another name ""real world data"". called bullshit. think boosters make sense maybe elderly - that's data highlights biggest risk waning vaccination date. I'm open booster see small pocket data showing necessary.

I think strange we've ton publicly available data practically everything pandemic call getting made based small pocket data hardly anyone seen.  Black African American thing. black people world African American. Yes, are. work dental office get weekly emails states dental society saying staff still required masked throughout day well patients unless they‚Äôre chair.  They're literally talking masks returning later year. Shoot UP! Boss babe energy Shots priced $20 right now, greasy fucks want bump price $150??? fuck eat rich starting pharma execs? People saying 2 weeks months lol. Actually, no. unvaccinated serving mutation factories virus. everyone could would get vaccinated, could shut whole thing down. Copium ‚ÄúBut unfortunately, new cases continue increase many  
thousands people, especially young, affected long-term 
symptoms leave sufferers unable live life normally.‚Äù collective, worst pandemic USA over. 7 July UK reported 30,000 new daily cases first time since January 40% rises hospital admissions deaths. 

And January UK seeing +500 deaths day‚Ä¶now it‚Äôs 30. number low, increase decrease significant percent change lol. People say ‚ÄújUsT wAIt tWo wEEks‚Äù want, month cases risen UK, 7-day daily death average UK went 10 20, back Fall, 7 day average went 50 400 less month. link deaths cases broken, it‚Äôs time open trust real science vaccines. saved

It's past tense think fine assume means ""up today"" So, serious question - danger 'oversupply' proteins antibodies?

Like imagine proteins pass particular threshold, might start clump, would bad, idea threshold might be. Herd immunity isn‚Äôt going happen long long time ever. There‚Äôs way many antivax people every country. key number 1 whether let people cheat not. work ton unvaccinated teachers break rules already. vaccinated teacher I'd love take mask I'd also like administration force coworkers make choice vaccine masks instead skirting rules. amazing, highly efficacious, halt spread (if ever reach high enough levels), make invincible.

Thank saying this. guess local community wear masks want do. need law tell wear mask wear one. line curving up, straight. UK announced 35k cases today also.

Look graph link. 7 day average keeps going higher. exponential growth. Sometimes feel like venn diagram female anti-vaxxers/anti-maskers bossbabes circle. cousin super anti-vaxx also shills Plexus. again, surprising since anti-vaxx industry (for that's is) major skin game so-called ""natural"" ""holistic"" alternatives medicine. consistent position Biden. sure 180 turn comes I'm fully vaccinated, I'm anti-mask anti-lockdown.

Every governor America lifted lockdowns mask mandates, I'm extreme one debate. western slope (where concert takes place) accounts like 20% cases despite less 2% population. issue is, 17 gave lot people.  aren‚Äôt part solution. problem. worry sicken. It‚Äôs problem.

This surprisingly common, though somewhat blood-curdling, attitude. first-class passengers Titanic doubtless felt way. 

Unfortunately even totally self-centered, swimming pool, happens one end quickly spreads other. could made statement January 2020: ""It's affecting Chinese! worry!"" huge outbreaks happening Malaysia Indonesia, coming big one India. world vaccinated years (I think 12% worldwide now), ongoing thing. Every infected person breeding ground new variants, seeing, doubtless blow right protection existing vaccines. course protection coronavirus vaccines fades time. 

It's ""our"" problem. OK lol. responded someone else asking exactly this. good info, thank you. long well forced strongly approve this. watch peers maskless still deal motivating get vaccine well (if parents allow them) easier use carrot stick. matter personal choice, cost living society. Refusing get vaccine break social contract. You‚Äôll also probably really shitty life keep saying ‚Äúwe‚Äôll step death guess it‚Äôs okay‚Äù know can't multiple reasons...

But forced everyone walk around hospitals covid see person (tv enough) pain suffering widespread age people hospital, bet vaccinations would higher.

Let watch kid die unable breath know I'm asking honest question, % overall population can't get vaccines one reason another (immune compromised whatever else)? 2% think may point.  devil details. Sure probably lingering efficacy years, enough? Especially new contagious variants? point booster 3rd shot seems aimed heading another surge. I'm sure vaccinated people probably fine delta even get break-through case, keep spreading unvaccinated morons. think kids school. Data tells us it‚Äôll fine virtual/hybrid learning work especially elementary. don‚Äôt shut schools flu high schoolers middle schoolers vaccinated then. 

It‚Äôs really appease paranoid parents virtual option offered bc know small cohort still thinks it‚Äôs dangerous kids. Early pandemic, former hospital didn‚Äôt even let us wear masks could ‚Äúscare patients‚Äù. almost May time allowed wear masks non Covid rooms. 

So pry mask cold, dead, hands point. one pushing likely immune escape. prove extreme claim. Yeah that's true, kinda wish did. wear masks anymore stores, generally avoid anywhere requires one  Recent studies indicating reason many population especially young asymptomatic due prior exposure cold causing coronaviruses memory T-cells giving immune system headstart SarsCov2. reasonable assume even cell response vaccine enough render people asymptomatic current variants virus.   Probably going end 1 dose mRNA boosters single dose vaccines least (I‚Äôm looking J&amp;J) Digital Certificates generally roled July 1st onwards (only ahead deadline) countries launching QR-code validating software past week coming weeks. probably still going take couple weeks come full force security significantly tighten around topic. death hospitalization also increasing.

hey Mr. admin, BBC ""reliable enough source"" sub? Delta wasn‚Äôt dominant variant US mask guidelines went out. [Let‚Äôs rewrite course knew coming; already said that.  never understood naive someone think that. wouldn‚Äôt stop wearing masks? third dose original Pfizer vaccine? Same. I'll get deemed necessary, fear mixed messaging really hurting things.

People know fence already saying ""see, vax work, need boosters"" (don't get started)

I worry bottom-line, money driven world, news reports say vaccines good Delta variant generate much revenue clicks headlines espouse dangerous variants are. 

Additionally, US falling short vaccination goals far reports mRNA vaccines protect years, Pfizer worried future bottom line that's pushing 3rd dose? 

Maybe I'm cynical. Everything 19th century pre-industrial. Columbus preindustrial, yet millennia ahead even developed nation Americas. 


Written language - driver knowledge sharing history preserving happened everywhere sooner later - worst measure. Aligns well term ""prehistoric"". think reading situation accurate, I‚Äôd wager lack transparency larger impact trust think.

We'll know months. meantime, makes sense Pfizer start putting together application they're ready case degradation hypothesis correct. 

But keep mind US public health authorities also conflict: REALLY want authorize third dose vaccine world first dose. good thing grandparents died year ago. covid numbers increase hospitalisation numbers remain low, issue? \*Genuinely asking open debate\* :) actually make sizable cohort flu vaccine recipients simply due convenience. Pediatricians offer well visits, parents already getting shots, etc. etc. drop flu vaccine seems happen end childhood beginning old age, blips radar pregnant women immunocompromised. true.

There simple solutions ""binds"". neurologist called covid ""a bunch government propaganda bullshit"". exist. Give break I'm expert I've heard there's limited mutation possibilities Covid could take break vaccination (based spike protein) without losing armful properties maybe that's complicated scenario ?

Plus, now, we've seen variants would taken advantage (based increase contamination potential) without vaccines. Despite vaccinated 2.5 billions people.

I'm saying I'm right. limited understanding topic.  Sounds like lawyer up. yeah sorry man, may maths teacher, wrong.

Linear growth case would mean R 1. would mean new cases every day would stable (300 new cases every day). Note still new cases every day here, total cases country still growing, growing linear fashion.

Anything 1 exponential growth, rate growth countries cases increasing day day. 250 one day, 300 next, etc, would exponential growth. 

Now, course different LEVELS exponential growth. R 3 really high exponential growth faster R 1.05, still technically exponential growth. I'm fully vaccinated. first couple notable mutations virus mean back masks restrictions, disaster.

Yeah number means basically nothing know a) big equivalent group unvaccinated people is, b) many tested positive, c) timeframe is. read chart, would you?  Quitting job probably major overreaction. COVID cases children usually mild. child likely die car accident drowning pool COVID. I'm trying morbid, give perspective. Except it‚Äôs novel virus that‚Äôs reached pandemic status üòâ makes think aren't? Hospitals [my decided month ago.

Also, FDA approval part issue. FDA approved, mandating vaccination easier, like hospitals already often mandate flu shots. bit different tell employees *have* get vaccination FDA approved. much silence Sinopharm. data see Pfzer, moderna AstraZeneca.  It‚Äôs mostly people lower education want get vaccinated. educate would best approach. think many resistent education. Looks similar [Our World problem Rt still 1.0, right? R 1.0, exponential growth happening, right?  Israel bring Pfizer court sold BAD product middle school 11 12 year olds 6th grade? many anti-vaxxers Los Angeles? would guess vulnerable populations getting vaccinated, vulnerable populations happen likely live multi-family multi-generational households. You‚Äôre also eating exhaust fumes same! You‚Äôre 100% right. Except we‚Äôre middle pandemic new highly contagious virus communicated. That‚Äôs difference. Vaccines working, efficacy declining (95% 78%) knows what‚Äôs going happen fall. Nobody - even experts. 

It‚Äôs immunocompromised obesity, diabetes, lung, heart, CNS/neurological issues - adult population US could check two boxes. Even vaccinated, mild asymptomatic infection affect heart, lung, neurological function.

So, yes. point need draw line. However‚Ä¶. Remember back last summer didn‚Äôt vaccine case numbers dropped hard? We‚Äôre part rollercoaster ride rip winter months everybody tired pandemic (me too, f ‚ÄòRona) taking precautions. 

Key point *we‚Äôre still pandemic* making progress haven‚Äôt made light end tunnel yet. lost many ‚òπÔ∏è‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs many others got vaccinated‚Äî-to protect elders communities.

Many tribes also ensured priority went elders culture bearers (language speakers, etc.). dinner local Greek restaurant Berlin - sitting outside, need test vaccine. Three ladies came along said wanted sit inside. ""Only test vaccine"" said waiter. Upon got vaccination passports out.

There probably places checking, round way seems working.  say sort assume God stupid simple are. ""Did Lord give us brains science, case 2 miracle vaccines?""  

What ever happened old saw, 'the Lord helps help themselves?"" Hospitalizations starting rise within NHS system

This accurate unlike year ago, they're seeing hospitalizations tend shorter, require less medical intervention much less likely result death average age person hospitalized considerably lower time last year.  We're seeing wave young, unvaccinated adults getting hit hard virus, UK Israel around globe.


Basically people much less likely hospitalized are, less likely long duration.  still pretty good shape, matter encouraging holdouts get vaccinated. r/notOPbutOK Yea concentrated certain states. wonder enough impact electoral map. I'm South Carolina never fully locked either.. one first nation case identified, never got bad surrounding states probably people about. bad pockets, especially Upstate 90% anti-mask bad places did. good start getting vaccinated numbers barely moved. mean. festival like probably high unvaccinated population luck it'll super spreader thin herd bit. also tend older people festivals. risk children line numerous illnesses (RSV, flu). 99% risk population able get vaccinated, there‚Äôs longer need shelter kids. 

At points risks virtual learning - entails learning development, social development, mental health perspective - far greater returning school   Poland clubs bars open without limitations since mid May cases still 100 per day.
Instead blaming young people, government focus checking borders.
These certificates completely useless vaccinated get transmit virus. it‚Äôs not? high rates comes higher travel risk imported infections, still reality everyone vaccinated yet. 

It mentioned vaccination come play well. fully vaccinated exempt certain restrictments coming another EU/EEA-country easily verifiable infrastructure established internally countries. Unfortunately easy vaccination verification yet established rest world, takes patience.  Yeah doubt lol friends kids whose children transplant recipients, district basically told parents ""oh well. can't anything"" Great point. Watch CGPGrey documentary South Americas big urban civilizations (cities exist). comes animals domesticated. So, Europe exists pigs :) problem. found reassuring! even fully defined ""Long Covid"" seems mean many things many people. talking post viral fatigue syndrome? Depression constant social isolation, lack exercise, prior medical issues popping due lack normal medical care? 

I know around three four months ago, literally every person Covid started talking ""Long Covid"" symptoms chalked number things might jack squat Covid infection.

Its starting remind ton people suddenly gluten allergy chronic fatigue syndrome fibromyalgia.  There's absolutely people suffering post viral fatigue see following numerous viral infections flu I'm skeptical numbers, based self-reporting various, vague symptoms linked number things, anywhere near high claimed. two outcomes COVID. Even kill you, permanently disable you. ‚ÄúAround two-thirds adults double jabbed virus, experts say helping prevent big rises Covid hospitalisations, although admissions increasing.‚Äù

Hospitalizations increasing, level cases. Yeah, sought first hand experiences Reddit googled people's experiences, pretty easy avoid reality news share much that. real! Nursing school requires every vaccine including flu shot. like flu shot, school got it. baffles many healthcare workers refuse shot. reactions mild u covid. studies show vaccine works! still catch thing vaccinated someone else around contagious. die, dad getting old I'll damned I'm gonna let choices stupid people threaten health well. oldest virtual since March 2020. told mom much hated school, now, times. youngest supposed start kindergarten, virtual instruction already missing year preschool going disaster, district discontinuing virtual learning, anyway. 

I really, really need kids go back school, unfortunately live Texas governor prohibited mitigation measures. 

We're fucked CDC care. 50 year olds eligible much earlier 20 year olds causes uneven spread thats right 100% even better 80% versus 70% arbitrary best. 75%? 85%? animal reservoir argument irrelevant domestic eradication. fact multiple countries sustained community spread elimination (Australia, New Zealand, China, ...) shows transmission humans animals relatively rare become ""endemic"" animal populations - least level regularly spreads back humans.

That would depend animals, density cohabitation, nature frequency human contact.

So, dozen sheep rural NZ farm, probably much risk, something like now-extinct mink farms Denmark [two-way

2) getting vaccinated morons would exclude prevention measure society large vaccines proven provide 

And hate world  I'm surprised Boulder Colorado list. dependent ""safety restrictions"" - dependent disease person - measure deadly disease infected person. IFR COVID flu roughly children, mean treated same?

I talking IFR. think sufficient data pediatric IFR regards delta variant. referring popular pediatric death metric number annual pediatric flu deaths pandemic vs number annual pediatric covid deaths pandemic. Again, need different approach covid, high transmission rate. 

Data places like Florida, Texas, Southern States sound interesting. important analyze data better understand effects covid young children. data children based different regions country. cannot comment that.

I agree beginning pandemic (2020 Spring) effects covid children mild nearly non-existent. However, advent variants (e.g. alpha), studies shown children get infected, infect others, get sick, like adults. vaccines available, cautious. hospital EVS worker wanna say jobs right staff follow standard precautions likelyhood getting hospital aquired infection super low!! hospital's infection rate zero years, meaning people come infections leave without them!!! using southern regions kind ‚Äúproof‚Äù density doesn‚Äôt matter sounds reasonable first, like much verbal soup post here, completely ignores differences lockdowns, mask attitudes, vaccination rates, access healthcare, qualify healthcare rural Mississippi example, rural California. 

Your attempt equate two laughable best, suggestion weather lovely June July UK weather lovely California year long. 
 
But OK, UK good, California bad. stand corrected. many countries vaccination still open group indeed prohibiting certain age groups glad work medical industry contagiousness infectiousness periods overlap

You're trying say contagiousness symptomatic here, right?

Because two words used basically synonyms. (Not exact meanings, difference irrelevant context sentence.) insurance premiums go up! Yay! Netherlands 11 deaths ages 20-29 408 deaths ages 50-59, 20-29 group way infections well, saying risk simply true. NL reopening bit shitshow though, right. Florida opened isn‚Äôt completely accurate it? local mask requirements recall. 

Florida already refusing report publicly number people hospitalized Covid. would hospitalizations death figures matter? study posted show asymptomatic spread accounts huge portion transmission thing that's pretty solid indication restrictions never go away vaccination rendered essentially useless there's going back normal one vaccinated countries talking lockdowns again.

Caveat: got either Classic 'Rona B.1.1.7 (the two variants around time) developed symptoms two days later.

Working hospital kinda wish did. problem might get fallout employees who'd rather work somewhere else get vaccine, administrators pee pants idea, especially massive labor shortage seems hit healthcare hard. Notable though- last employee COVID case heard nurse anti vaccine (I get problem there) got firefighter boyfriend, something like 3 months ago.

I'm bigger fan soft stuff- employers gave people day cash bonus getting it. Good luck getting kind benefit hospital, though. Refusing free vaccine get time really lateral move generally. Refusing 100 bucks paid time attached get LOT bites ""mildly anti vaxx""  also convinced viruses cause long term symptoms reason despite well documented.

Let's get back topic. Omg 1%, everyone panic. article month two ago COVID patients *themselves* still deny literal dying breaths COVID real this, unfortunately, shock me.  can't afford money want weekly, silly.  That's good all.......but third world countries? Lol suppose ship cold central point dry ice local places. wouldn‚Äôt worried US, Israel etc. countries using it? That‚Äôs different story. Exactly

Lmfao proceed laugh third world countries scramble China vaccine they're readily available ignoring fact third wold countries given literal Pfizer/Moderna crumbs moment. asking ramp production Pfizer/Moderna countries US Canada UK get ordered shots. exactly. That's way go. can't make mandatory, attach many conditions life become tedious vaccinated. Make condition employment, going school, attending large gatherings, travelling, entering country, ect. pretty well vaxx'd NC. worn mask months except flight. I'm surprised see someone mask senior kid. even think more. enough?  Well hope fucking so. Heaven earth moved them. I've heard jab, might experience fever like symptoms, aches, etc indicate active vaccine working within system. zero symptoms imply may gotten inactive vaccine dose? I'll sore arm jab. still plenty vulnerable people vaccinated. might fault, still inevitably result hospitalisations. well transmission gets high, larger proportion vaccinated get seriously ill too. Usually poop toilet don‚Äôt befriend what‚Äôs there, hey, you!   could downgrade. Benchmarks ongoing. Seriously. Congrats. that's capitalism works, yeah  What‚Äôs American Indian? what‚Äôs annoying countries fudging numbers. statistics (horrible statistics) critical making right go forward decisions here.

Russia, China, India, Brazil - places aren‚Äôt publishing true per capita data. Maybe Peru closer spots realize.  think big part old western movies. many movies filmed monument valley Navajo reservation. kinda mixed cowboy tropes taking wisdom Navajo. lot old cowboy movies showed respect. NC's vaccination rate 50% months ago. Missouri nowhere near NC. US really big state politics vary wildly. Calling Indians today absolute disgrace. Native Americans. Sounds like military soon fall. Partner‚Äôs unvaccinated mom needs fly US domestic, possible issues flying could crop up? Yea I'm wondering even tracked. many ""dead"" vaccines given already? even knows?

I understand people sides issue, fully support tribes people choosing term phrase feel best community. However find interesting many people thread offended term ‚ÄúAmerican Indian‚Äù even told accepted phrase many tribes, response basically say ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre wrong, called something else.‚Äù

Either outcome likely. ssn, drivers licence, healthcard. However immunization records mine province.

Covid vaccines records find kept province reference healthcare, know province wants share immunization records whether federal government outside party wants research reqards effective certain immunization treatments work.

The sharing medical data based want, data. people acces doctor myself.

You may say like census worked census know make hard determine data comes who, open this. 

The province regards covid vaccine records, dont know. called vaccine hesitancy hotline cant put someone tell this.

The day CBC listened interview lady wants national vaccine registry help ""encourage"" people get vaccine well creates large amount data help prevent next pandemic. 


What want plain simple going happen data? That's it, fog around happens really concerning coming government. ""I'll take chances."" Ohio too. Looks like knew. Booster shots fall. Still believe Healthcare professional? Booster shots fall. feel now? wonder work intensive perhaps research intensive adaptation mRNA vaccines new variants is.  That's funny, said entirely inaccurate. 

There way studied issue asking data support long haul covid, especially adults. Someone studied would never asking that. main difference CDC much tougher job setting guidelines because:

1. Education health policy set individual states.
2. Many states run Republican administrations happily risk citizens' lives chance poke federal government eye.
3. Many state government still Covid skeptics see need preventative measures (or scared upsetting voter base).
4. Whatever case, there's wide range opinion policy across country, whole issue become politicized statement pushes preventative measures condemned overreach. ""JUST TWO WEEKS!""  Seems consider stats Israel California State Capital 84-85% staff vaccinated outbreak 9 infections, 4 fully vaccinated people. Great news correct. Brazil vaccinating 1.2 million doses day average hasn‚Äôt FDA fully approved vaccines yet? end approving it, lot people get vaccinated! I'm 31, long-haul COVID. even extent developing brain lesions. awful. vaccine helped, I'm still flare ups. bad diagnosis really looking like MS tests back. initial case COVID bad all, I'm healthy overall. all. 

Norway looses tightens restrictions countries every second week basis, decided set level infection rates testing rates individual country needs fulfill get loosened travel restrictions. 

Greek region Crete also got tightened travel restrictions update US rates gone set limit. US gets affected course becomes case ""anti-America"". Lol people still believe conspiracy theories. China hiding thousands dead people also virus big deal exist, etc. totally agree, anything made pandemic worse removing ability counties, states, schools mandate masks social distancing even vaccines. culture would almost laughable deadly. think it‚Äôs like sunk cost fallacy. would take admitting wrong 18 months. Thanks! second third fourth fifth chance baby. true actual fully developed human being.

Am able return without quarantine? still need two tests?

Apologies stupid question, I‚Äôm hearing many different stories I‚Äôm confused.

Thank never said case, important one, seriously taken account along reasons mentioned. Yeah, I‚Äôm saying wear mask house around family, it‚Äôs still best interest wear one public, indoor, congregate settings. don‚Äôt understand controversial, I‚Äôve given trying wrap mind around culture wars US. thing can't trust statistics schools accommodate, true too.

Lots kids health conditions one (or combo of) 504, IEP, IHCP spell accommodations doctors school worked keep safe, schools follow them.

The difference covid thing protect kids young get vaccinated (or vaccination effective) around unvaccinated unmasked people. schools going figure make work, kids legally entitled education much child. Hopefully public benefits special classification willingly contracted COVID foolishness. There's significant percentage even fully vaccinated people still risk contracting virus (see Israel, numbers already well way herd immunity) hate private insurance companies, get $1200 per year discount none smoker. fully support $3000 premium unvaccinated complete refusal pay Covid treatment, feel like far/ inhumane.

Maybe give another $1000 fully vaxxed least. got money impetus travel internationally still anti vax moron. basically saying, ""look know better, don't!"" win think is. told people else *think* interchangeability directly effort inclusive. PBS Breitbart! 

Because know we're talkin population depending factor ranges 2 million 5 million people course going folks fall multiple different categories terms like. yes - change matter days. People get first dose likely getting second supply august. Same. WTF?  hell Kansas stubbornly stupid? Hallelujah Clearly taking vaccine least short term misinterpet you?

Your actions creating people get vaccinated, going back normal. example, Ireland, they're taking allowing vaccinated people indoor dining public indoor socialising. BJJ coach said wont accept anyone unvaccinated train club lives high risk person. Countries already implementing systems ban travel unvaccinated people.

Personally, Im disgusted too. dont want government power decide things like that. Unfortunately, people like dragging out, measures like inevitably going become common, people countries try protect another wave.

Meaning addition putting others risk reasons understand, also giving governments private businesses incentive deny access benefits free society. again, measures discussed unprecedented. It‚Äôs almost like nurses shift workers doctors doctoral degrees‚Ä¶  evidence yet suggest J&amp;J work well delta variant. Sounds like saying thing (some people vaccinations get sick enough require hospitalization) disagree scale problem.

In end, number vaccinated people get sick die still depends big next wave be. proportion much smaller, thankfully, higher number cases (and UK rivaling worst previous wave) vaccinated people breakthrough cases suffer, especially elderly otherwise vulnerable.  hospitals vaccine moves EUA phase. 

They probably could already likely view worth legal hassle, assuming vaccines become fully approved soon Absolutely. posted children.

There TONS data long covid adults. even worth posting Google 5 seconds. common knowledge point. aware yet another reason posting definitive ""no"" response - even done research!! Agree Kansas Midwest south UK teachers vaccinated plans vaccinate students, resistant COVID school states, science wrong right, patient less brave? Good point, thanks kids still wear masks buildings. wear mask requested. Luckily, kids old enough understand distinction.

Cases finally low state (NJ), otherwise going business normal. finally ate restaurant family 2 weeks ago. kids camp summer. Mostly life normal, masks little thought. bring random shopping trips anymore. bad idea middle schools. 6th grade mix 11 12 year olds.

It's another illustration people communicating effectiveness vaccines (public health authorities, journalists, anyone) need better number things. examples:

- careful specify measure vaccine effectiveness they're using. Reduction risk infection, illness severity, severe illness.
- Explain non-severe symptomatic illness means (people seem get idea either hospitalized severe illness, ""just sniffles"").
- Explain better X% vaccine effectiveness means. people still seem think 95% effectiveness means every fully vaccinated person precisely 5% chance becoming infected, even though would make sense. wonder we‚Äôll able mix match booster shot. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

What mean, then? literally looking ""short long term effects"". ""short long term effects"" worried about, ones think they're reviewing right now? 

The threshold 'lower' pedantic way weasel initial position. threshold question nothing legitimate reasoning get vaccinated. Jesus take ambulance wheel!   Testing almost certainly massive factor here.

Every approved vaccine far great lowering strain health workers preventing deaths. Seems like people can't accept wish people Sinovac start dying feel ""superior"". Quite disgusting behavior tbh. UK reporting - hold beer. depends define stupid.

If way knew choices could come back bite us ass. unusually public spat broken makers one coronavirus vaccines federal health officials whether booster shots soon needed.

Pfizer German firm BioNTech announced Thursday plan seek approval booster shot within weeks, predicting people would require vaccine boost six 12 months fully immunized. Hours later, Department Health Human Services issued emphatic rebuke, saying ‚ÄúAmericans fully vaccinated need booster shot time.‚Äù

The statement mention Pfizer name, said ‚Äúa science-based, rigorous process‚Äù headed Centers Disease Control Prevention, Food Drug Administration National Institutes Health would determine whether boosters necessary. decision, statement said, partly informed data drug companies.

Pfizer‚Äôs chief executive months predicted boosters could likely within six 12 months, seeming offer certainty question captured public interest even public health officials academic scientists said wasn‚Äôt clear yet booster would needed. pharmaceutical companies involved making coronavirus vaccines working formulating testing booster shots prepare possibility.

But Thursday, Pfizer released statement indicating time near. Pfizer said vaccine‚Äôs effectiveness eroded, citing two lines evidence outside scientists yet see detail. includes Israeli government analysis showing delta variant virus became dominant, vaccine efficacy dropped. study yet published conclusions questioned outside scientists. Pfizer also cited continuing follow-up people vaccinated last summer.

‚ÄúWhile protection severe disease remained high across full 6 months, observed decline efficacy symptomatic disease time continued emergence variants key factors driving belief booster dose likely necessary maintain highest levels protection,‚Äù Pfizer said statement.

Pfizer said would submit data regulators within weeks showing booster six months ‚Äî third shot original vaccine ‚Äî caused antibody levels shoot five 10 times higher original two-dose regimen. Moderna announced similar data May.Pfizer also announced would begin testing booster shot specifically programmed combat delta variant August.

Scientists applauded statement HHS saying boosters imminent. many researchers anticipate booster may needed say essential prepare shots ready deployed, far clear needed.‚ÄúMy opinion right now, however, current vaccination seems largely ‚Äòholding,‚Äô‚Äù said E. John Wherry, immunologist University Pennsylvania‚Äôs Perelman School Medicine. ‚ÄúBut companies seem suggest continued follow trial patients shows concerning levels waning immunity. much data companies publicly available yet. agree need much independent data assessment possible topic.‚Äù

Some experts think boosters could needed soon fall, others think could years. Many predict people continue protected serious cases illness, even immunity wanes. foresee scenarios people particular high-risk groups may need boosted sooner.

‚ÄúNo one saying we‚Äôll never need booster, say need give public impression vaccines failing something needs done matter urgency. ‚Ä¶ time isn‚Äôt now,‚Äù said John P. Moore, professor microbiology immunology Weill Cornell Medicine. ‚ÄúThe decisions going made made federal agencies.‚Äù

Pfizer announced May projected global sales coronavirus vaccine reach $26 billion 2021. company also frank current pricing ‚Äî United States, $19.50 shot ‚Äî temporary. earnings call February, Frank A. D‚ÄôAmelio, Pfizer‚Äôs executive vice president global supply, noted typical price vaccination $150 $175 per dose.

‚ÄúNow, let‚Äôs go beyond pandemic-pricing environment, environment we‚Äôre currently in.

Seems like pretty good outcome. article mess. single quotes multiple sources (many US unidentified beyond ""scientists"") buries part depends heavily local vaccination rates keep headline scary. Taking broad statements aimed global audience applying Vaccine Availability: Country alarmist garbage. Time tell. believe scientists right almost everything regards pandemic saying everyone mit vaccinated eventually get reach herd immunity. Maybe SC close that. see next month. saw that. I'm going assume many 14 positive cases. People came over. News 13 reached Florida Department Health hospitalization numbers last month, told hospitals longer required report data. also asked area hospitals luck. Centers Disease Control Prevention, however, provide info show numbers going wrong direction.

Just reiterate, Florida longer giving public data hospitalizations Covid. CDC numbers though.  propose close everything people UK already vaccinated? Ok. Truck drivers subject quarantine rules? That's news me.  Hyperbole doesn‚Äôt make statement untrue. There‚Äôs immense pressure governments keep things open, people forced home office office. kids school let people work. parents.

Teachers important job. Socializing important. we‚Äôre midst global pandemic, things getting worse.

So feeling actors treating school like taxpayer-paid daycare ‚Äúhome office‚Äù idea quickly forgotten, don‚Äôt want that.  1. Hospitalisations always lag weeks behind infections know whether stay low not

2. infections also means alot people getting long covid still relatively little known mostly red tape approved, there's probably data, use cases, studies, people drug arm drug FDA reviewed.  folks saying find excuse take even FDA approval, wish they'd get thing red lined approval negate excuse. How's symptoms? Mask wearing effective sons school well. One class outbreak 3 kids gave socially outside school, one else class caught them.   death matter it‚Äôs young people? strategy far worked well around world:

* lift restrictions
* shit bed
* Reinstate restrictions CDC go record state science tells us regard requiring vaccinations school.

You're exactly right, that's *should* do. fact telling.  Honest question: still contract pass along vaccine, seem ethical enforce? There's reason emergency approval. dont know either way though. Better safe sorry. delta indeed cause breakthrough infection significant portion vaccinated.

Why would breakthrough infection able cause long covid? Take look UK (which week along roller coaster). 

Compare current UK wave previous waves,. Deaths clearly WAY (10x?) used earlier waves reached level cases..

I agree UK wave looks scary nevertheless. know side effects normal, harmless, uncommon vaccines, 

They uncommon! People talk maybe, quite common. reaction covid 19 vaccine quite close reaction tetanus+pertussis+whatever booster. 

Babies dogs get noticeably affected vaccines. Rabies vaccines seems knock puppies quite consistently - vet know likes delay month two past legal date (rabies basically extinct anyway).

Vaccine side effects really common! Ask pediatric nurse. 

And side effects usually good thing, immune system noticed something wrong using tools fight it. immune system bothering swelling fever, pain likely also bothering effective things like antibodies specific that. can't make mandatory

Advice definition mandatory. Full FDA approval requirement CDC offer advice recommendation. Yeah dislike antivaxxers much anyone despicable person making light people dying. nothing rule long term health consequences getting covid say case numbers down? argument here. Thank you, that's reassuring. news, lava hot Yes streets. Regular sodom Gomorrah going on. guessing tens thousands party goers vaccinated. (%) = (RU - RV)/RU √ó 100

where RU = incidence risk attack rate unvaccinated people RV = incidence attack rate vaccinated example, = 0.8 (expressed differently 8/10)

‚Ä¢	‚Å†RU-RV = 8 ‚Ä¢	‚Å†RU = 10

We write (10-2)/10= 8/10 = .80.

Further split equation (10/10)-(2/10)= 8/10 = .80

This gives us RU-RV

1.	‚Å†‚Å†Risk unvaccinated (RU) 100% 10/10 (makes sense vaccine, 100% risk)
2.	‚Å†‚Å†Which leaves term reduce effectiveness measure perfect 100%: Risk vaccinated (RV) 20% - 2/10

Following formula literature, risk infection vaccinated inoculated SARS-CoV-2 20%.    people idiots. safe effective vaccine countries already fully approved it. FDA irrelevant.  agree.. sooner someone‚Äôs symptoms show up, faster isolate anti-vaxxer, would like Trump get vaccine DL, tell everyone get it.

I would bet paycheck Tucker Carlson actually vaccinated. always thought ""Native American"" odd choice ""PC"" term. like France colonized Germany, inflicted many atrocities people, named everything France, left started calling ""Native French"" post locked due Rule 4 repeatedly broken. Almost nobody except covid conspiracy theorists deny possibility vaccinated people still get virus transmit it, even becone significantly ill, argument chances happening low longer necessary mandate people make significant changes life, since goal isnt necessarily zero risk contracting covid, rather get baseline risk infection rates serious illness similar already experience flu.

If someone wants argue goal absolutely zero risk covid everyone ok, think thats tough position take one likely unrealistic, understandable conclusion come to, one im sure could effectively argued for.

However, really argument rebuttall deopping covid restrictions simply say vaxxed people still get covid - thats basic fact accepted nearly everyone alside conspiracy theorists, disagreements debate alround kind case numbers vaccination rates warrant dropping restrictions. I've Pfizer vaxxed since May caught Delta variant last week. foresee another outbreak, can‚Äôt trust parents kids honest vaccination status, keep making mistakes Yep, getting people responsible take part caring surroundings difficult. work use electrostatic sprayers least 3 times day disinfect waiting room surfaces go back physical cleaning scrubbing least many times needed. Waiting rooms difficult though due needing respect people's situations also needing ask accommodation get job done. Thank much! ‚ò∫Ô∏è health policy set individual states.

Untrue. Educational policy mixture state, local, federal policy. plenty federal educational mandates. even federally weighted comes healthy policy. Almost everything health federally regulated funded. case, there's wide range opinion policy across country, whole issue become politicized statement pushes preventative measures condemned overreach.

I agree. However, question becomes whether Biden administration going display leadership whether going play politics. made explicitly clear intends play politics. Maybe one level surprise yet another level disappointing. difficult take anything CDC says ""following science"" seriously recommendations obviously driven what's best health what's likely get votes. Maybe kids need that. Mine transferred state's online-only school district start pandemic. returning K-12 classroom ever. district one.

We need day care.  story say many 46 vaccinated. said one person vaccinated died. 1 9,000,000 could well issues begin with. You‚Äôre infringing right dangerous asshole! mean kind it, rather 6 7 days know infected it‚Äôs closer 3,  CDC recently put guideline saying 12-29 year old males risk myocarditis (which clear up). lower risk getting myocarditis via Covid I‚Äôve reading also far delta variant deadly reports. say good, latter part could silver lining. One biggest problems covid knowing many variables stem that. long incubation period added lot complications. Shortening timeframe contact detectable virus and/or symptoms could step towards becoming like respiratory viruses deal with.   know couple kids got covid school way schools report data get counted school. way virus mutate it‚Äôs replicated host infection. people, cats, mink, dogs, become infected greater chance Greek letters thrown around.  use God excuse. ""If Lord says time, time otherwise he'll save me..."" several stories radio people taking precautions saying ""Well, God get not."" 

They probably walk across street without looking ways.  reporting happening US. Understand situation UK.

No idea approach better.

Man, many mixed messages days. even worse that! people would catch virus, test positive believe doctors telling virus say virus exist.  Sorry , using raw case numbers counting vacinations silly. needs end point. Sad hear : (

To downvotes: similar setup Donald Trump would torn Republic currently ruler gtfo  I'm skeptical claims... Long Covid spotlight media many researchers since beginning pandemic. studies kids this, apparently provided conclusive enough results cause large concern health agencies. year half vast majority research data showing miniscule effects kids Covid, I'm personally going worry much it. Based science, I'll continue much concerned flu season toddler Covid. There's literally book it, called What's Matter Kansas Ah, yes, explains UK California per capita COIVD death rates different... wait second.. they're practically identical. 

While behavioral differences confounding variable, hypothesis population density impacts COVID spread really supported. case, would expect rural regions lower COVID infection rates death rates. least within US, opposite true: low density rural regions highest infection death rates. 

Weather likely *does* play role, may biggest driver accelerated transmission (humidity) support California. Southern California notoriously dry air, worsened indoors need air conditioning given warmer client. UK greater humidity average, less air conditioning (which dries air) needed. said, connection humidity, temperature, COVID spread tenuous best - humidity seem one better predictors. Interestingly enough, metastudy showed wind speed may actually even better predictor either. 

Regardless, UK actually quite lovely June July. Ok, tell 100% spewing random made garbage.  Well production is, patented product. right Pfizer's job distribute globally. seems approval third dose would create competition supply, terms health impact best thing get many people possible receive 2 doses. think it‚Äôs absurd American embassies vaccines Americans abroad.

Also note Singapore fully vaccinated 33\~35% population time Bukit Merah Market outbreak 36% cases Bukit Merah Market outbreak fully vaccinated. population exposed Bukit Merah Market cluster similar vaccination rates Singapore overall, efficacy mRNA vaccines infections (including asymptomatic ones) delta variant quite low, maybe even close zero.

Note Singapore one countries using mRNA vaccines vigorous exhaustive contact tracing testing program capable finding infections, including asymptotic ones. visualization shows half fully vaccinated got infected asymptomatic. explains difference efficacy results countries asymptomatic mild infections mostly undetected.

Sometimes need throw caution wind what's right. Btw I'm I've fully vaxxed month issues what's excuse besides muh right?  wrong you?

None stuff going happen, midst pandemic rational among us know it‚Äôs almost see things improve restrictions eased never power infact always getting butts kicked virus. mostly unvaccinated. that's also NL vaccinating age group similar UK. People 20s 30s middle receiving first dose right now, month significant fraction fully vaccinated (NL 5 week interval shots). nightlife reopened, also mainly young people getting sick spreading virus. Hopefully even poorly vaccinated states bad Fall/Winter last one, because:  
- Hospitals gotten better treating people. 
- Many already immune response previous mild cases. 
- Even states bad overall vaccination rates decent 60+ year old coverage.  
 
I still think stark contrast better worse vaccinated states terms hospitalizations deaths. comparatively high level worse vaccinated states still better last year's, deemed ""acceptable"" then. stable enough make decision, can, within reason geographically/logistically go whatever provider want.


That's super common I'm there's 3 big players healthcare, one excluded one another insurance provider, extra 10 minutes ambulance difference $10,000 visit, $75,000 one. Risk pretty much tho 20yo 50yo. problem young want Switzerland. Compared total shitshow NL become. That's Switzerland way did. 50yo generally go events thousands people.    Pfizer/BioNTech Moderna want sell products, expected. want many orders possible. 

This need regulatory bodies like FDA, ECDC, CDC etc determine whether booster actually needed. great companies researching boosters, demanding independent regulatories start recommending them. aware old restaurant job pictures hanging kitchen word LIAR written lol depends individual. Vaccines success rate, rate varries person person. example, immunocompromised higher risk getting sick immune system 100%. Things like stress, illness, genetics, malnutrition, pregnancy, etc decrease immune system.

If get vaccine, guarantee get sick, massively better chance getting sick get sick, youre likely less severe illness. 

If vaccinated person contracts covid, (which normal vaccine invisible bubble shield) body neutralizes virus stops replicating spreading simply virus replicate spread. get sick, even though might get severely ill certainly pass virus along. kind thing I‚Äôm talking about. mRNA vaccines cause cells produce spike protein, saying target protein. think it‚Äôs inevitable end multiple rounds boosters varied approaches. Sure, called ""The Moron Option"". Wearing mask prevent living life? Multiple states reporting similar numbers. governor Maryland said every person died covid Maryland month June unvaccinated. governor New Jersey said 99 percent new cases unvaccinated people. Missouri‚Äôs health department saying same. 

So number may 100 percent exact it‚Äôs probably pretty close.  That's true forever, every disease every immunocompromised person. There's nothing special COVID regard. mean, many willing take risk wearing masks, vaccinated, literally differently protect others.  Umm‚Ä¶ Indians. natives. Measles significantly contagious even Delta eradicated aggressive vaccination campaigns.

Measles eradicated. around 20 million cases year. 90000 cases Europe first half 2019. long cross-border travel exists, national elimination achieved remain temporary state.

One thing working measles animal reservoir, unlike SARS-CoV-2.  California also nowhere near dense UK far better weather. People stay outdoors far far longer UK.  cheerleaders spectators wear masks sports games. Nobody saying student's can't wear mask. simply required. Feel free keep wearing mask.

And people refuse get vaccine unfounded fears spread conspiracy theorists, likely experience societal pressure get it.

It's supposed make ""feel"" anything. show new medical technology, part misinformation there.

The risk *death* covid quite low, however long term effects, seem concerned comes vaccines, unknown. Long covid joke knows long damage lasts. Logically, makes sense risk there's need. might fine, might deal permenetly lowered lung capacity, loss 2 senses knows else. confident fine? say Im fear-mongering anecdotally, know cases, also anecdotally, 2 people know died virus ostensibly healthy men 30s. Again, confident you?

The main side effect vaccines seem blood clots, except contraceptive pill also cause clots much higher rate currently reported vaccines. Yet, still use them. Why?

Your point cohort people risk doesnt detract fact virus already changed become infectious. I've said, bothered reply to, people like give virus chances replicate mutate. That's people unwilling accept BS excuses. say certain next mutation wont yet contagious potentially even deadly? then?
