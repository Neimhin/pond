0,2021-08-11," Pfizer 88% effective delta variant dose

I smart enough know answer question, but, square earlier reports 42%?  need verify resident legal status etc?

The idea vaccinate EVERYONE regardless citizenship immigration status since covid care that, human.

So yeah, checkout CVS/Walgreens website, say insurance ID required. Even though ask walk give driver's license, name DOB - give shot?

Yep. Leave ID field insurance field blank. better yet, sign online fill forms online go in. let skip insurance fields. believe slightly modify dob addresses case.

In case, literally asked name time reservation. even charge case?

Nope, government paid shots. CVS/Walgreens try charge insurance companies since still store give shot, think charge gov insurance incorrect. Multiple universities made mandatory. think 973 175 fully vaccinated.

Illinois releases breakthrough data here: Need worry people getting first two doses push shit IMO  don‚Äôt think so. might add age range like 60 doubt would boosters entire population vast majority world unvaccinated. hope last pandemic surge natural infection vaccines move endemic level. 

I get frustrated media saying super resistant strain going come US UK. Sure could happen think it‚Äôs like happen 7 billion people offered vaccine yet.

Edit - add can‚Äôt even get people get two shots lol. 

We know soon data Israel says booster program.  Okay, regardless that, still take vaccine, already. nothing lose. many crazies.

A culling occur, possibly massive scale truly deadly pandemic.

No mask crazies. N95 properly fitted=no pandemic.

Yes, friends, pandemics. smaller ones, believe 3 (SARS etc) past 20 years. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

I'm assuming comment mostly fans packing stadiums? college football programs reporting 90 100% vaccination rates among players staff. spend way much time reading studies vaccine efficacy everything related pandemic. 

And total nerd stuff, honest advice would get 3 week mark. 

I come across compelling data shows higher efficacy vaccine longer interval. info observational subject confounding variables (example: countries ‚Äúone dose now‚Äù strategy geared supply towards elderly vulnerable, means healthier individuals usually ones got large delay doses. efficacy data incomparable demographics different)

Anyway 2¬¢ That‚Äôs we‚Äôre luckily district distance option. We‚Äôll wait month see plays out. Absolutely TX legislature tried pass something address governor's powers emergency declaration spent much time petty political shit.

This concern entirely unnecessary health protocols followed largest extent possible.

We debate perspective data good portion population actively undermining effort reduce harm societal level.

There's stake, well. immense spike due large youth transmission cases cause medical systems collapse (remember, reason locked first place, flatten curve).

Thus, routine issues could get treated may get deferred. critical matter need care may take longer get worse. emergencies may travel counties away find hospital capacity. suffering death result due virus, second third order causes.

Your analysis first order depth, impact COVID children. issue now, many people, happens get time (hyperbole, within six eight week period many states already strained healthcare we're winter yet). hope everything turns alright, think docs told so. confirmed inflammation going say maybe anxiety. I‚Äôve suffered severe anxiety probably 5-6 years almost always pressure chest throat/neck area. gone motions cardiologists, doctors, ER etc. Every test book, I‚Äôve done everything good. mind races 100 miles hour day lol.

If young/small children, could consider KF80 masks, also Korea. level filtration KF94, ones found seem smaller fit better small children. opinion better fitting mask, even less filtration, probably better job ill fitting mask higher filtration rating.

Number hospitals staff shortage [Percentage]: 10 [5%] 37 [17%] (+28%) ------- Number hospitals staff shortages nearly quadrupled week.

Above comparisons made using state profile reports found via healthdata.gov.

The following numbers directly CDC website.

Number patients currently hospitalized covid, July 30 vs August 6 vs August 9 (most recent available): 9,483 13,405 14,415.

From above, 41.4% increase July 30 August 6, 52% increase July 30 August 9, 7.6% increase August 6 9. 

Looking demographic trends hospitalizations comparing January peak. Rates given per 100,000. First number January peak, second number August 9.

The truth virus can't get much deadly either kills hosts gets chance jump another person; people proactively avoid anyone exhibits ill symptoms pure self-interest, cause viral strains burn out. exists now, virus encouraging people wear masks, keep distance, lockdown, also inhibiting ability spread eventually reduce number people susceptible infection strains viable threshhold. point herd immunity achieved, least particular strains. freedom sit ass day, eat drink whatever want. unhealthy well please. 

You freedom contract highly contagious disease risk giving kids, like freedom drink handle vodka get road right after. mean presidents *do* kill kids, whether invading country, arming another ordering drone strike. There's lot children's blood underneath presidential seal.

The moral argument compelling butt fucking stupid Desantis acting time crisis. 1. Society reached herd immunity.

2. living rock? still carry infect others despite vaccinated. 

3. is, right now, waning effectiveness. Masks help that. saying it, MUCH importantly, reporting it, peer reviewing it, stating studies since last June proportion direct findings scientific studies. Read last pub med papers. It‚Äôs literally talked issue regards spike protein Mrna efficacy right scientific community‚Ä¶ propose do? smoke like trooper everyday. never covid. entire household infected twice. made times. shared bed someone whilst positive still catch it. 

It's anecdotal sure, maybe truth this. study little late game lol   something needed studied? Interesting. feel like could swab microphone used singers announcers conclude seeing massive amounts saliva particles (not saying drenched, relatively speaking). smoke like trooper everyday. never covid. entire household infected twice. made times. shared bed someone whilst positive still catch it. 

It's anecdotal sure, maybe truth this. diabetes, liver heart disease contagious. getting vaccinated, ppl making already terrible situation much worse. Herd immunity never reached. 

Therefore, additional redundant measures necessary.

The country grappled stuttering vaccination campaign despite offering four domestically made vaccines cost several regions introducing mandatory vaccinations public-facing workers. 19.7% population received two vaccine doses Thursday, according independent monitors.

See comment below. would never happened people i.e. 70-80% population manned got vaccinated. would absolutely need this.

The antivaxxers (again) ones blame here.  Among vulnerable population Israel (age 60+) 89% fully vaccinated 3-4% recovered received one dose. Dept health, one remain consistent. Every CDC link went away course. Yeah looks like redundancy got monotonous, reporter touched cell, two cells actually. likely 16 years old. 

Here's point, unvaccinated bit. Calling names. Look youre really targeting. 

Media went saying black people unable get ID something like that. calling kinds things way blaming Republicans unvaccinated. reality case. Unless saying AAs shifted Republican party. 

*black people genuine fear concerns vaccines. Hence low rates. *

Thats told mentioned seems like segregation, letting people move without vac disporpotionnatly affect AA. counter white racist peoples fault AA dont get vacccined. Okay fine, thats counter rebuttle. 

Look NY pal boat OP. denied cancer surgery April 2020 due lockdowns.¬† seemed like everyone tiing communication lines.¬† Trying get PPE, trying ti get surgeries, nursing homes becoming infested. Theyre trying get elderly boat, thats happening. 

*Meanwhile, ship comfort empty. empty, wanting help. *

I felt pain, them. pal better. Got surg summer. Hope guys wife singing rain soon. One theory longer time shots UK helping versus Israel gave shots early little time between. ...lol, sorry, definitely greedy dumb fuck. seen republican party? That's less honest list.

First all, get compare Italy Spain anyone anything. hit massively Covid anyone knew happening, thousands people dead could even think planning response.

Secondly, **never** include micronations (San Marino) list, statistical flukes carry far much weight. 

Thirdly, can't seriously compare US poor Balkan nations, even EU. 

--------

That cuts list 

Belgium

Croatia

Czech Republic

Hungary

Poland

Slovakia

Slovenia

United Kingdom

plus two felt necessary include, ""close"":

France

Portugal

------------------
------------------

Now, comparing Covid deaths excess mortality, US **under**reported Covid deaths roughly 10%, factor Portugal Croatia.

The UK **over**reported Covid deaths nearly 20%. Hungary 25%, Slovenia 30%, Belgium France 50%.

The countries left list **under**reporting Czech Republic (15%), Slovakia (30%), Poland (by something like 37.5%).

So two three EU countries could compare US favourably to. exactly rich countries.

But makes feel way better fact US thrown advancing storm hands tied Trump cronies, resources disposal never allowed save citizens, go right ahead.   today (Aug 12) Israel 748 hospitalized COVID patients.

A 50% weekly increase get roughly 4,000 within one month.

The confirmed cases going 50-60% per week past month half, scenario possible.   Year road schooling say vaccine requirement say mandatory Darwinism UK Part EU anymore. It‚Äôs floating away. people virus, chance getting several.

For simple example, let's roll one die make six deadly variant numbers one five non-variants. roll die roll 1 6 chance deadly variant. roll die 6 times, chances see deadly variant? roll 100 times, chances see deadly variant? 

This simple example hopefully make clear opportunities random chance happen, likely happen. Thank you! truly didn‚Äôt know. people demonstrating ""magnetism"" vaccine actually showing that. showing oily skin. seen youtube video guy sticking like 30 spoons face, well covid existed.

With universal availability vaccines, adults make choices. don‚Äôt spend time around children, vaccinated people *significantly* less likely spread covid. hoax, disappear election yes feds dropping random illegals wherever please right pissed. No. Means higher viral load spreads easier. That‚Äôs kids kidding sick. Higher viral load. Right work nothing losing job. Party Local Control ... take away salary getting vaccinated... want vaxx, really big deal?

Test 2x day expense.

Work got someone vaccinate test shift. months apart.... 
And that's least partially talking saying potentiate other. can't make stuff up. history text books comedy material future. ""Governor Abbott... recognized foul stench brought board."" Nooooooo that‚Äôs fucked yo district FL showed 8 cases tracker last week.

My mothers father younger sister died pertussis older sibling permanent damage diphtheria. father went school kid got polio. Polio scared shit everyone rightfully so. happy get vaccine available. 

By time wave think lot people fearful COVID too. 100% safe? Never it‚Äôs ever going away completely. Hopefully get close number possible. Exactly this.

The vaccine stop getting COVID. makes less deadly.

That milder infectious periods means chances transmitting drastically reduced, impossible.

Deadly strains come parts world access vaccines whatever reason incredibly low vaccination rate. I'm guessing read part said, got upset, result. really interest talking someone accuses spreading false information, see spreading false information.

[From vaccines teach immune systems recognize fight virus causes COVID-19. typically takes 2 weeks vaccination body build protection (immunity) virus causes COVID-19. means possible person could still get COVID-19 vaccination get sick vaccine enough time build protection. People considered fully vaccinated 2 weeks second dose Pfizer-BioNTech Moderna COVID-19 vaccines, 2 weeks single-dose Johnson &amp; Johnson‚Äôs Janssen COVID-19 vaccine.

Even want question understanding efficacy, just.. wrong people hospitalized.

[From Department Health 96.5% COVID-19 cases February 1, 2021 ‚Äì July 24, 2021 fully vaccinated  96.0% COVID-19 cases February 1, 2021 ‚Äì July 24, 2021 hospitalized fully vaccinated

This means \~4 fully vaccinated, far cry ""not single"".

Me getting vaccinated plays little role happens you, I'm putting risk hospitalized dying. choices, yours.

Have done homework? know on-going trials for? know still waiting Safety Efficacy data come trials used get Emergency Use Authorization FDA, primarily 2 year follow up?

How feel us still gathering Safety Efficacy data shots given trials pre-Delta variant? really need hospital capacity, living semi-normally overwhelms healthcare system. wonder since start pandemic, terms used like middle war. 

Like, mild cases = Covid cold, disease require hospitalization (thus occupying healthcare resources)

Recoveries = [you said that]

Deaths

Severe/critical cases = require hospitalization even ICU

Was difficult define metrics would like live quality life? use public 'mild' definition? counting recovered anybody dead stopping there? 

I'm quite worried future. Wish Covid damages better defined, unvaccinated vaccinated people age ranges None schools attended child done anything besides clean, sanitize, wear masks. Georgia Whats insistence stupidity?  many ventilators NICUs/PICUs available? majority unvaccinated conservative-leaning, assume means mostly pro-life. keeping youth alive healthy? couldn‚Äôt find actual source data LA Times recently referenced one researcher calculated mandatory masking *only* mitigation strategy implemented you‚Äôd still see 40% students infected within 3 months school starting. thing ""completely safe"". take risks avoid every single day life make life enjoyable. Continuing living fear getting fully vaccinated borderline insane. sure you‚Äôre downvoted. I‚Äôm anti mask, read well wondering exact thing. 
They seem prove distancing masked unnecessary difference infection rates different distances masked. conclusion going back full capacity person justified assuming kids masked. far masking, looks like districts masked since lower general population numbers, said worked. That‚Äôs nice likely true, scientific conclusion doesn‚Äôt similarly situated comparison control group. people US refuse use masks? 48 million children get right that's 96,000 dead.


48 million children get next year there's vaccine that's 00,000 dead.



What want, 96,000 dead 00,000 dead? many personally willing let due middle ground? 1,0000 dead kids low enough bar you? children die? People going rely local resources, standing army going go charging rescue. may help, significant length time dent this. That's actually true.

The vaccine stands (pre Delta) intended prevent hospitalizations death. clearly states intended prevent infection, minimize impact body.

That said... reduce time infectious. Ergo reducing chances spreading widely. likely mutations die body.... Rather allowed proliferate outside victims. Yeah npr said Delta R naught 6 yesterday spit cereal didn‚Äôt realize high Triangle resident ‚Äî I‚Äôm happy hear that! Yay!! Always there.

Grow up. That‚Äôs sad story, still day amazes available vaccine people still making silly excuses taking it. research revised show vaccinated people can‚Äôt transmit it, understand even vaccinated could transmit this. mean pandemic unvaccinated unfortunately people adults ‚Äúcould‚Äù get vaccinated seems slightly disingenuous headline sense vaccinated person transmit well, thus cdc recommends everyone wear masks right now. difference correlation causation? Statistically going fine little worry about. truly hope makes full recovery long term issues. However, mind miserable days make realize important vaccine is. got original covid, mean immune delta variant. long covid keeps mutating, we'll never run people infect!  could seen coming?

I'd say generally think they're smarter others, earn living. Good chance might think they're smarter others vaccines too. Hope I'm wrong. think way...it's great time avoid people. They're crazy, right now. People lost minds there. Yeah think making statements like realistic helpful. took seriously initial outbreak I'm actively going resist attempt take another two years life away me. vaccines, work really really well, I'm enjoying living again. Mandate vaccine to, get approved children, let's move on. There's life virus. dude wears also giving high fives kids difference correlation causation? Um ok, military military though, I'm really sure trying articulate quiet place true. Don‚Äôt forget gerrymandering! everyone also forgot death lagging indicator.  South Korea, Vietnam, Atlantic Canada wonderful success controlling transmission within borders.

The money issue complicated. Presidential race, need able reach entire country, requires lot travel advertising. House Reps, much smaller area campaign in, every two years, need constantly it.

For solutions, propose:

Makes perfect sense Tom‚Äôs gonna spike idiot kid like Wilson. awesome dude like Tom Hanks produce little shit? Lolllll. That‚Äôs awesome used real name. might same. I‚Äôm really worried state dropping hammer, wouldn‚Äôt make sense agree last statement. I‚Äôm saying waiting case may paid ways one. hope regular testing expense.  mean bootstraps right?  long complete social unrest. Way off-topic, starting school late-July normal? MN, it‚Äôs usually Labor Day. kid starts week year, people look like dick growing forehead tell them.  I‚Äôm tired this, cases gotten bad cancel Colorado vacation. feels like we‚Äôve gone straight back beginning, another year this? get science, get data getting really old. Mask vac motherfuckers live dammed life again. whatever takes get everyone vaccinated finally start move past shit.  Eh, that's really much variant specifically though, time since vaccine. They're also getting closer approving boosters immunocompromised individuals, means boosters groups hopefully following soon behind that. We're still protected unvaccinated though, like we're somehow *more* vulnerable gotten all. example family owned businesses rarely last past three generations probably fully vaccinated (even says otherwise) Hopefully go get free shot. problem, they'll require negative test. need protect frontline workers! didn‚Äôt advise anyone need proof insurance get vaccinated here. government wants kids live new normal life, mandate school pay taxes (happily) give remote option asynchronous curriculum provide us instead making kids go school dodgy situation. deal issues everyone complains about. I'm child screeches every time I'm inconvenienced anything. get hell it, one asking march war (which way, used glad that's today). wearing piece cloth around face. Americans ridiculously weak whiny, easy thing deal with. Everyone know easier time Moderna side effects Pfizer parents flip side people waited may better protected you. It‚Äôs cut dry situation. Ok. 1st shot 3rd dose? 2nd shot 3rd dose? Thank Damn
So afford it? 
Must expensive balls got big bucks  people start dropping shi* get real government move certain response. Well we're going full Floridaman. Actually floridian elderly somehow high rate vaccination. 81% least one dose. started good DeSantis still boast that. still good portion risk, knows many already isn‚Äôt even close known yet. people *can* transmit vaccinated doesn‚Äôt mean *enough* people transmitting *enough* vaccinated people catching keep R knot value 1, case virus dies out. could it‚Äôs high enough, absolutely don‚Äôt know yet.

That sensationalized WaPo headline CDC data Provincetown done number people‚Äôs understanding don‚Äôt know vaccinated transmission. Yep. nursing homes ICU/ oncology departments. Anywhere full vulnerable people

It's brutal families tho. need make testing stupid easy. I'm noticing testing area started filling bit recently Delta scares  community protection aspect, you‚Äôre right. However, getting vaccine Feb susceptible infection/hospitalization getting May, it‚Äôs hard sell upside.

I wish data dichotomous data ‚Äúvaccinated vs unvaccinated.‚Äù need know *when* too, may help spur agencies recommend boosters, sooner.  Looks like territorials learn lesson 1865. Send marines. chance deadly variant spreading decreases.

You're taking ""may"" statement turning ""will"" statement. That's almost always bad idea comes complex biological systems.

It's fallacy leads people say viruses tend mutate less deadly. true. Something like HIV 100% lethal untreated. transmission occurs become seriously I'll, lethal matter. SARS high mortality rate also short asymptomatic period symptoms quickly obvious. Covid works span several weeks. mutation could easily cause fatality rate increase significantly without reducing transmission/epidemiological dynamics. mutation also caused immune escape theoretically also increases transmission compared vaccine-suspecptible There's little work hey random mutation produces deadly variant. need several actually deadly variant capable spreading quickly. 

Not necessarily. probability drops.

Yes, probability multiple mutations less probability one mutation. 

That's usually find new variant dozen mutations (not counting things like multi-base cleavages). need form al once. get one mutation, becomes entrenched variant, spreads, picks another mutation. That's basic, garden variety evolution action. evolution works much quickly reproduction is. entire point.  fucking hate life Chit idiot really news. happening across country close year. many grades sent home various times region. help argument? Millions get flu vaccine every year. Outside outright nuts (conspiracy, anti-liberal, freedom, etc), there‚Äôs huge group unvaccinated ability think collective responsibility/benefit. see one person saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm young healthy; think I‚Äôd get Covid okay,‚Äù I‚Äôm going lose it. 

It‚Äôs *you* okay; it‚Äôs trying extinguish fucking virus that‚Äôs ravished global economy killed millions people. *You* chip least small way, unlike poor peasant Bangladesh would love dose that‚Äôs expire eat lots vitamins crush CrossFit week. √® la fine""

""This end"" delta variant going run unvaccinated folks many southern states.

Oh n^o^^o^^^o^^^^o Except case, getting vaccinated earlier may worse since effectiveness seems wearing quickly mRNA vaccines‚Ä¶ Yes. boys, see point. daughter made friend there. boy he‚Äôs funny, always wriggles ( lot kids do) he‚Äôs absolute maniac. really dig lot. also friends another little girl met there, hasn‚Äôt seen person ages. 

I older girl go middle school we‚Äôve always treated members household people boss around. middle school dude soldier actually improved aspects schooling. even got student month. 

I would venture think it‚Äôs mature wise peers. Also strong mother helps lot.  Red meat statements base look like strong man. 1 shot, 3rd dose new variant out, protected much less vaccinated later (apparently). Deny COVID care unvaccinated. *might* get asses vaccinated. LOl! Thanks laugh! :) It‚Äôs autoimmune condition destroys thyroid time leads hypothyroidism. Grave‚Äôs disease similar except leads hyperthyroid. 

I think singular preventative inhaler makes us immunosuppressed. translation summary pf what‚Äôs going non Spanish speakers. Every employee works restaurant bars must vaccinated, restaurants want open 100% must ask vax id open 50%. Also government requires school college (even private) personnel vaxed, include children 12.

Also context, Puerto Rico mandatory vaccines schools college since 80s 90s.  schools enforcing mask mandates well can. would seriously ask school ""what action steps school take students exhibiting improper mask wear?"" problem I'm seeing kids wearing masks properly I'd would literally correcting every couple minutes school day. I'm classroom teacher position entails spending time number classrooms school wide issue. Given, we've 4 days establish routines big issue disciplinary action improper mask wear. refuse, send home, kids bad wearing it. point, teachers blind wearing masks noses even pulling almost soon corrected them.

The easiest thing make sure child good mask really stress wear it. Pfizer beat Moderna market got head start. higher production, kept head start. non American lives Florida since 2 years... fuck protests? people publicly forcing go leave position? Getting jail? Anything like that? people die, keep going on? wouldn‚Äôt would affect sheer numbers sick therefore bad outcomes.   would fraud, would imagine dumbest dumb, probably vaccinated anyway, would this. apple fall far tree. point them, like also absolutely too? Lol.

I guess take-away many poor, rich, uneducated, educated, otherwise different demographics certainly populate anti-vax unvaccinated crowd difference two groups also exists. end though see equally bad risk analysis, fatally so.

And results verified countries, take Russian/Chinese word it.

But yeah...Moderna looks like candidate top dog. CVS. Walgreens. Walmart. Target (which CVS). Pretty much anywhere.

It's true vaccinated prevent getting covid, prevent infecting others, reduce risk. also reduces risk dying covid ... Actuarially speaking, expect health insurance companies start demanding higher premiums willfully unvaxed.

Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Can‚Äôt 13-19 year olds get vaccinated though? What‚Äôs issue? Yeah Florida tho think interpretation presented article bit off. So, yes, Dr. Fauci rightfully points low vaccine uptake create problems, including increased chance emergence new variants. you‚Äôre extrapolating bit that. First, limit infectious CoVid variant be. Second, immunity infection severe disease doesn‚Äôt come vaccinations. getting vaccinated best way protect yourself, recovered COVID-19 degree immunity infection, it‚Äôs also likely B cell responses first infection make subsequent infections less serious. Even new variants, it‚Äôs likely previously infected vaccinated less susceptible severe disease. means fewer hospitalizations deaths subsequent waves. Basically scenario virus becomes endemic, serious epidemiologist saying now. Variants continue occur, it‚Äôs virus becomes different virus suddenly evades immune response. aren‚Äôt going situation forever. Lockdowns aren‚Äôt going last forever, restrictions. COVID-19 become less deadly live it, like live flu. People go bars gyms often kids home. thought hard core would say salaries school leaders getting vaccines. school district session 1 week. 19 confirmed cases 50 quarantine. Hooray year 3 working schools me... September 13th seems like far ways away it‚Äôs literally next month! What?? Thank you. hint good news I‚Äôve heard 15 months. Need stop piecemeal vax mandates pull bandaid. National vaccine passport require indoor public businesses require them. Get boosters available likely knock breakthru infections. We're going wind eventually anyway sooner sooner get back normal. least normal we're going get.

Fearless prediction: Tsunami levels infections schools get well underway. Something could minimized schools imposed vax mandates young kids. approved. Either act stuff seriously, condemn us years crap. FEMA sends teams physicians nurses. set entire new wards staffed either within hospital tents. honestly feel bad people fed misinformation people (politicians) trust, especially since politicians know damn well going on. That‚Äôs don‚Äôt work healthcare lmao seem missing point walk CVS change vaccine status 20 minutes. Can‚Äôt race, sex, sexual preference, age. isn‚Äôt segregation promoting general welfare population, constitution. really sure medical privacy plays it. Nobody‚Äôs asking sexual history anything like that, full body scanners airport would give away vaccine pass would. Bullshit.

The Spanish Flu concern today. Whoever vulnerable, burned through. Whoever resilient infection survived it. Eventually, passed combination evolutionary pressure virus kill hosts community developed immunity effectively disappeared.

So happen COVID. lives matter    Mermaids. Covid carrying illegal mermaids coming ocean border. many people hospitals got vaccine? Betting it‚Äôs pretty close 0.

Fuck it. Time go back normal life. don‚Äôt vaccine point legally / medically able get deserve face consequences go mask don‚Äôt distance. people following guidelines whole time got vaxxed don‚Äôt deserve suffer mentally anymore. Well, humanity longer exists, it'll moot point Today told (by anti vaxxer) people get vaccine dont go hospital dont trust doctors. magically appear droves? Likely hold court

Are lawyer, understanding public health law beyond layperson? understand would think that; authority states local governments enforce public health measures well-established. Nah K***n, Covid find first... can't imagine that's legal going get fat check get sued record say?

... see tomorrow... effective mean? Wouldn‚Äôt avoiding hospitalization effective? seems major issue this. got first Moderna shot Jan. 28th, second shot Feb. 25th. live near large hospital small town, late January two people work texted saying ""They're opening requests shots, sign later today website qualify."" qualified asthma that, couple days later hospital called early morning saying ""If make vaccination site, get first one today.""

&amp;#x200B;

Basically got tip also got lucky. lying caretakers older immunocompromised folks skip ahead. 

Can confirm Lol... Yes Kids miss lot school cultural holidays (Roshashana, Yom Kimpur, Armenian Christmas, Lunar New Year, etc). Schools get paid based daily count students attending day. Instead getting funds low attendance days, school district builds ""local holidays"" schedule kids likely attend school days. Hence, starting August still need meet minimum 180 school day requirement. Hey, 100 years nothing geological time scale. lot us selfish jerks. Wish different literally new sets articles every single day. Basically copy paste. wait every single unvaccinated person country comes magically unforeseen realization, using thousands dollars medical equipment hospital staff? know you‚Äôre joking, I‚Äôm sure toddlers/young children less dosage 12+ far I‚Äôm concerned, DeSantis currently committing crime humanity. Im even sure point political gain. He‚Äôs killing base. think might mad. Mississippi always best worst. everything.

What shame. Beautiful state. I'm extremally disappointed forever restrictions forever mask mandates thing. thought would turns never problem seasonal. freaks bit. one knows train headed.  announce ventilators shipped, feigns ignorance federal government trying help. easy get different job right now. Hawaii strict I‚Äôm surprised haven‚Äôt mandated vaccine residents tourists alike would solve problems right now. Constantly going back restrictions mandates ‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt give fuck anti vaxxers point. feel bad brainwashed forced get shots nothing change ministry health app contact tracing. think would wise install given projected case increases end result might same. given zero fucks, might transmitted host people, number might died.

Pandemic control happens one person; happens population large.

Had people backwater town rural Georgia shitheels‚Äîand masked up, stayed home, gotten vaccinated (our rate 1+ doses abysmal 27%), maybe gotten sick, maybe rates going rails right now. I‚Äôm starting like experts seem blaming us surges. seem touch times don‚Äôt factor human behavior. Even somehow got 100% planet vaccinated Covid would still this. isn‚Äôt smallpox situation also infect animals/wildlife. easily mutate something even dangerous way. going vaccinate wildlife too? 

Covid isn‚Äôt going away. think experts people aren‚Äôt yet comfortable admitting that. point really besides protect information tools now? I‚Äôm vaccinated. I‚Äôm aware still catch Covid regardless haven‚Äôt already. expect get Covid many times even fully vaccinated person. also know chances dying go ICU remarkable lower. 

I agree children need vaccinated ASAP. Otherwise I‚Äôm done. zero energy protect refuse protect themselves. also zero interest chasing expert‚Äôs wet dream zero Covid. I‚Äôm also uninterested living life fear something don‚Äôt control over. Nature evolution going inevitably win matter do. say right thing got shots.  SEPTEMBER?! See power self reflection reason please children Nawwww real? Yeah got mine February. lucky! think needed raise concerns. Remember grade school, specifically math science classes, always ""critical thinking"" questions end section. Teachers always us skip them. Maybe hard explain? hard grade? Either way, we're stuck adult population never learned critical thinking skills. 

Obviously, there's it, still think huge contributing factor. maddening. glad living Ca pandemic. county Health department wants mask mandate legislature allow it. person maybe 2% kids wearing masks.üò¢ distancing...nothing! I'm worried know do.  zoom map lot liberal cities high vax rates actually pretty well. Rural America shit show, surprising. forgetting important point get COVID last 6 months waiting.

Also u probably take u sit restaurants lol true... got third dose Pfizer today. First two doses side effects beyond sore delt.

Third dose hit like truck. Fever, myalgia, chills, whole lot. He's literally saying long get 90 percent. Hmm. Yes seem silly suggest impossible. risk hike fairly minimal, crowded concert venue? much. Fauci literally saying article long get 90 percent, new variants forever lead permanent restrictions Basically, become organ recipient end time. Oh! give citation vaccine mandates? a-hole friends would gourd that. ... actually quoted hospitalization figures... Death counts even lower - 8.9 per million vaccinated. yeah proportions roughly - 90% reduction. pronounced though already.  Clickbait title. Countries world experiencing surges -- even much fewer hesitants. There's reason believe fewer hesitants would resulted ""America crushing COVID"". UK, much better vaccination acceptance, went way higher US much surge recovery still daily cases per capita US. Israel getting butt kicked too. Vaccine hesitancy bad thing...but devil Delta. Pay walled every teacher strikes, what? Neopolitan Vaccine Here's anecdotal experience.

I live California. got J&amp;J April got Moderna (mRNA) booster two weeks ago concerned information coming J&amp;J's decreasing effectiveness Delta. 

Reading suggested Moderna + J&amp;J would likely better efficacy Pfizer + J&amp;J. That's somewhat anecdotal, though studies seem finding Moderna offers better protection Pfizer general lately.

All make CVS appointment. appt-booking website shows vaccine location offers book brand want/need.

My J&amp;J vax via state-run drive-through clinic collect health insurance information. Booking CVS appt online required entering large amounts info including health insurance.

My MD (who's following latest research interested getting booster themselves, vaxxed way back January) suggested CVS would deny noticing state-level vax database, suggested try anyway see goes.

I showed CVS day appointment, asked ID, nothing else. 15 minutes came administered Moderna shot. Gave card saying shot 1 2 complete asked come back second-shot appt. (I sure yet.)

It appears CVS assumed unvaxxed. glad end position might tempted lie status get booster. read media booster-seeking Americans ending position though.

J&amp;J gave headaches / leg aches generally worried (rare) blood clot complication. recent Moderna shot side effect bruise-like soreness injection site four five days. Major peace mind increase too.

Despite online CVS appt booking demanding much personal info, store noticed signage suggesting walk-ins welcome too. also passed mobile vaccination clinic walk CVS could fallback needed. 

However, would investigated option going ahead make sure using resources allocated folks greater need myself. Obviously vaccine offered would factor too. luckily CVS came through.

One last ethical question concerns America flush vaccine doses less fortunate nations struggling obtain any. Vaccine nationalism called. ethical us seek boosters people vaxxed all? reasoning American seems large stock vaccines far less demand days due rampant anti-vax misinformation. 

Covid-19 vaccines expiration dates, given lax demand, J&amp;J shot's middling reputation, personally felt justified seeking booster. can't say selfishness there. want OK obviously. felt like, given knew, actions depriving someone else vaccination. Hopefully right. Maybe, feel like might ascribing way much logic people.

But guess people try anything they‚Äôre good desperate hope without getting much politics (this sub really strict talk this). I'm holding breath though younger demographics (18-35) consistently least involved voting bloc US. would love proven wrong future.  agreed. mean loss smell terrible, debilitating. husband dealing now. classed neurological condition makes sound way worse reality theory it‚Äôs Louisiana fatter, much better food.

i would also like that. do. may ask, terrible vaccination passport? 18 months ago, Rand Paul's wife invested company behind COVID-19 treatment promoted then-president Donald Trump. TREATMENT usage profits increase SPREAD COVID-19. disclose now. Hey all! 

My question probability England getting rated Delta Variant area, least Germany.

What chances think could change next weeks? 

I live Germany, go England work soon. Germany's new law says people quarantine 14 days somewhere variant area, matter vaccinated not. I'm trying decide try replaced work trip, rather risk quarantine 14 days. 

Also, quarantine, would make miss flight home Germany, I'm really trying let happen.

I'm starting wonder anti-vaxxers longer want live hoping covid defeats them? example sounds like someone enjoy living anymore.  lol ‚Äúvaccination passports‚Äù years. fact literally could go school without certain vaccines. fuckkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk

offffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff Fair point....of course, kids often stronger immune systems :) know tested antibody levels vaccinated kids, 12-14 charts, way higher adults. really sure medical privacy plays it. Nobody‚Äôs asking sexual history anything like that, full body scanners airport would give away vaccine pass would.

You right refuse disclose vaccination status, right assume treat vaccinated.

Wish better example, similar situation. Imagine want act adult movie. ask prove HIV VD. refuse prove them, reject you, protect actors. thing applies here. worried lambda variant?? fuck Ez solutions.

No HIPPA violations here.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* DeSantis clearly mentally unfiit office. 15k hospitalized patients 3k patients ICU Florida. 4 deaths would statistical anomaly, likely due data delay. really hope ends political career like 45.  That's job government: provide rules well, govern, enforcing them. job society force government laws force people help society thrive. 

We've tried self-policing. obviously working. Businesses fatigued. time new rules make serious. Get vaxxed outcast. Full stop. virus never go away decide day day goes much risk willing take matter, data trash anyway. Where's go fund page? i‚Äôm breakthrough moderna person 2.5 weeks ago fully vaxxed april  wife Kazakh. say shit fucking ignorant. glad Americans freely get access Pfizer moderna vaccines. Kazakhstan gets Sputnik doesn‚Äôt even cover delta variation well. 

In addition, Kazakh culture communal based gatherings (large dinners, funerals, weddings). restrictions app track cases. Things bad near level beginning. country also sparsely populated ~20 MM people large country. Mom (who late 50s, 120 lbs formerly healthy) caught COVID last November she‚Äôs chest pain ever since. EKG bloodwork done recently cholesterol levels insanely high extent doctor basically told eat unsalted brown rice. eats less almost anyone know; she‚Äôs going echocardiogram soon get comprehensive picture may wrong. Strangely Dad kinds underlying health issues obese never even caught COVID even though quarantined 30 days. think genes may determine gets sick much age/health status.  Senator Bill Cassidy great find original video YouTube, CNN interview makes first 3 minutes 5 seconds one) Shhh don‚Äôt say quiet part loud. Damn, US backward? guess countries need example: least we‚Äôre awful US teacher shortage couple years ago masters degree plus teaching cert needed teach Kentucky Schools. They've since lowered bachelors teaching cert. guess, I'd say masters degree. good analysis. Give chance. There‚Äôs difference age medical decision made yourself. *There's many tho* just... kind f'd country live midst worst pandemic time GOVERNOR putting ""NO"" mask mandates??? point rise remove him? He‚Äôs getting people killed. It‚Äôs kinda fucked employees though, like government saying employer needs terminate make wrong medical decision yourself? government dangling people‚Äôs livelihoods heads coerce making medical decision antithesis freedom. patron bar/restaurant assure vast majority us want mandate. Enough enough already. may done part rest hasn‚Äôt world hasn‚Äôt. pandemic stay while. Since vaccine free, would say child uninsured. fraud. currently 400 serious cases, 150 fully vaxxed. reference, NYT overall population 60% fully vaxxed

So stats would indicate vaccine provides 0 protection serious cases? That'd 62.5% serious cases vaccinated country 60% fully vaccinated. Ehhhh afford kids days...üòÇüòÇ

Nah really though enjoy lifestyle is. look friends kids think ""Man...that looks awful!"" 2016 pew research showed level migrants.

Florida 775,000
Texas. 1,600,000
California 2,200,000

So real issue argument data. California many immigrants, more. exploding? mostly Texas Florida? Florida worst least immigrants general?

Yeah... because, would obviously contribute degree, driving factor.

Also, Texas, Abbott says stuff. Mostly lies get base riled up. border areas dealt via federal agents keep people tents tested. negative, ""set free"". positive, quarantined. simple Google search show MANY verified reports tons sources.

Even ironically, go watch videos border portals rounding up. immigrants wearing masks... So... Literally immigrants sense large portion Texas Florida

The whole thing absurdly frustrating. even hard find facts, MANY outlets, prove dishonest Abbott DeSantis are.... school district 19 confirmed cases alone... doubt 105 correct. cosigning opinion. That's ugh stood for. spouting nonsense attempt justify anti vaccine stance. DeSantis commits act terrorism. Arrest him. Hugs, friend. worth, 10 year old got covid month (not school) extremely mild, kids know gotten it. Statistics side! That's aunt says haven‚Äôt caught Covid yet. Coincidence? People think may dumb likely far smarter realise. Wait doc approval approve vaccine kids start this, given knew kids would main source spread schools? smallpox. Heh, George Washington first mandate troops inoculated.

We really living stupid times, people experience life vaccines. someone ELI5 90% effective extreme illness means natural immunity 90% effective preventing extreme illness. 90% effective vaccinated? always sounds like 10 percent vaccinated people end hospital obviously case. go anywhere maybe. show vaccination status several times already. imagine objective get cases close 0 mandate vaccines. Zero Covid places find Covid attractive dealing surges. Can‚Äôt exactly blame 100% this.  Well you‚Äôre gonna refuse long time. Herd immunity isn‚Äôt coming. I've actually thinking whole time.  Since carry Covid even vaccine, maybe mandate negative tests.

Source: wife double Moderna dose April sitting next Covid. name NASDAQ MRNA.  ‚ÄúAt end May, 6 per cent Canadians fully vaccinated COVID-19 compared 41 per cent Americans.

Just two months later, Canada overtaken neighbour: 63 per cent Canadians fully vaccinated compared 51 per cent Americans.‚Äù Poor guy! entire world chance kill Covid year half ago. Seriously, global population self isolated 2 weeks time.

Unfortunately US wasn‚Äôt source delta lambda variants.  believe sinister variants emerge corners globe.  2 days reporting Ventura County, CA yet statistically meaningful, past 4 days, Covid daily new case rate, already low, dropped 30%, deaths still 0 1 per day, ICU dropped 40%.  Here, vax percentage 65%. finally, measurable numbers building amongst Hispanics evangelicals. whites remain hard core anti vax. would important shot. immune system good 1 pill day catch it, sleep bed partner whole time covid get even kissing I‚Äôm starting wonder.  Sounds like it. nurse local, smaller, Advent hospital said lost 4 81 shift last Friday. entire state losing many 5 days later seems pretty unlikely. imposing government mandate ban mask laws. Almost like need government protect people. unpopular opinion think correct. sort lockdown keep fatalities spiking next week. Mississippi first hit point think many states far behind given lack available ICU-level staff available help out. Nailed it. Covid might endemic simply downgraded common cold. 

Also majority us vaccinated might simply get natural immunity. 

So I'm incline optimistic side thinking instead one guy. outdated. precedent doubt Supreme Court would overturn precedent wily nily. Roberts court overturned altered precedent 21 times, third within last 20 years, two even previous Roberts decisions. fact Roberts court overturned altered 8 cases Rehnquist court, court, Rehnquist conservative court.

In fact, Roberts overturned altered 2.2% precedent cases, one lower rates recent courts. tight decision seem honor precedent often not.  That's fine long morons clean pick dead carcass pavement zero effect people around them. That's reality. I'm people believing whatever hell want long detrimental effects around them. Choosing vaccinated, preventing herd immunity, allowing infectious virulent strains arise affects everyone around them. hypocritical people choose remain unvaccinated still go hospital sudden beg help healthcare experts, doctors nurses think lying them. sure take numbers jabs distribute people also showing vaccination proof airports otherwise. know several people Munich got jabs homecountries drove back car. Bet many get way well Also good science changes. data changes. Irony San Antonio. Texas.  Wonder offered immunocompromised fully vaxxed months ago. doubt they'd open got second MRNA dose week ago. absolutely June 8th? No...most every country position nearly ""crushed it"" failing, vaccination stop delta variant spreading sufficiently. fact countries attempt crush seem faring better moment. inspected particular graphic uhhh research purposes, way hell bottom row third position left actual sex position average heterosexual couple could perform. anyone recalled yet?
Just curious Oh thank god. went got booster Moderna table today, bet it'd help mix Pfizer doses back Feb/March. feel much safer now.

If going try this, go small pharmacy say insurance. asked ID, fill form. hopefully get official boosters, soon. great.  Keep social interactions reasonable. Alright, know you‚Äôre troll, go back conspiracy filled subs stop peddling garbage. Well... sucks.  I'm inclined believe delay best under-reporting worse. 

The 3K ICU concerning I'm reading COVID ICU mortality rate 20% overall (if someone got source/knowledge please share). sadly might see 600 people gone.  Yeah sue anything considering mmr vaccines required public schools like 30+ years gonna lose. Good. I'm assuming keep socially distanced animals, too? unprecedented times must maintain constant vigilance.

It'll great day lifeforms planet readily vaccinated. thick get QR code essentially data + signature, copying QR code would mean copying data well, paper might show info scanning QR code would essentially show someone elses info.

Also, trying modify QR code info would mean signature longer matches Yeah, it'd near impossible do. it'd necessary people take themselves.

States would call state/national guard it, might cause (easily stomped out) rebellions. It'd worth amount deaths caused less amount deaths covid would've caused otherwise. Unfortunately, stupidity people not. even varies wildly region states. Shasta county California June 2 36% least one dose. (County around 177,000) state whole 62% least one dose.  950k excess deaths.

And wonder there‚Äôs labor shortage movie would walked already it‚Äôs unbelievable. That's go-to drink, makes sense vaccination method well. says fully vaccinated shouldnt quarantine vaccinated people carry viral load studies. seem recall Reddit (not necessarily sub) convinced opposite months ago. remember one specific article claiming Moderna's protection short-lived, example.

Things like (the fact different studies come different conclusions) proof view topic, is: matter! vaccines reduce risk serious disease death 90+%. impact delays people try pick choose One True Vaccine ten times greater impact choosing ""wrong"" one.

Even Chinese vaccines high 80s percent: infinitely better nothing.

Once everyone's got protection engage hand-wringing figure improve situation, indeed whether actually worth all, might necessary.  Proof good society ALWAYS trump individual rights need becomes dire enough. humans hadn‚Äôt taken mind, we‚Äôd still hunter gatherers even extinct. Lol, federal workers pay stopped due tantrum border wall $750 monthly fee even won‚Äôt negligible amount compared college costs. actually believe cops need less excuses pull people over, cities towns need less excuses fine us, morons want drive around unbuckled fly windshield it‚Äôs survival fittest. first waves resulted mass field hospitals. staffed military doctors, nurses, others.

We may see something like again. difficult predict, many GOP governors opposed federal intervention right now.

You can't teach CRT public school even wanted to. entire histriography approach, single topic there. Good points. Stats still concerning though.

That's pretty clearly here. hard tack ""to 43"" onto end title it'd still sound interesting enough lots people read it. TL;DR: Please get vaccinated,

‚ÄúAs June 19, 2021, Covid-19 vaccines estimated prevented 7.2 million infections 27,000 deaths England alone. 

Similarly, United States, estimated 279,000 deaths 1.25 million hospitalizations averted end June 2021.13 

As delta variant affects various countries, including United States, current imperative vaccinate many people possible, quickly possible. ‚Äú  Yeah, hardly coincidence almost every single country towards bottom list remote island See above.  understand anti mask think impinges freedom.

Someone another thread recently said 10% Croatians live either Germany Austria. think Luxembourg, 50% people actually Luxembourg passport. bet even many live across border either Germany France, skewing numbers even more, eligible vaccination home country country residence.

So must hundreds thousandes people EU eligible vaccination least two different countries. method (or incentive) get raise hand say ""I already vacinated.""

It fact official vaccination numbers Luxembourg considerably lower Belgium Netherlands make think problem exists (and affects smaller countries larger ones).


I doubt EU green pass vaccination app re-adjusts national numbers (data protetction). least, vaccination numbers whole EU relation entire EU population accurate given national numbers.

I think vaccination rates lot less accurate people think are. EU, least mitigated ECDC also counts vaccinations gives percentage EU whole, negating effects internal migration. Still, countries keep vaccinating run people vaccinate, statistics say may may reached 80 85 %, percentages may deceptive. healthcare workers? 8 months first jab. Acting like cult leader.

Sounds like NZ want deflect poor vaccine rollout blame countries mess. Elimination never realistic countries working great strategy Australia moment. vaccinated wear mask enough entry anywhere. Shouldn‚Äôt need additional test think understand genetics. There's approximately 30,000 base pairs virus causes Covid. There's 4 different nucleic acids, giving 8.1 x 10^17 possible permutations. exchanging one base another may produce change genetic material operates 3 base pair codons. codons code 20 amino acids many codons actually code amino acid. virus change, need change end point protein structure. also relevant structure protein. 

The spike protein example coded 3831 base pairs, 1277 amino acids. ones really matter amino acids active site protein attaches cells well control protein folding. single point mutation result change, change allows better binding, change allow less binding. protein fit like lock key, one change wrong point result protein even binding affects folding around active site available binding.

There's reason despite fact 200 million people infected, person producing millions billions viruses, Covid picks 1 2 mutations per month. every mutation beneficial, may actually kill virus codon stop codon ends translation useful protein made.

I‚Äôd prefer year round school. remember getting two weeks Thanksgiving another two weeks Christmas. get couple days Turkey day week Christmas. feel like spreading school breaks uniformly across year would also help retaining knowledge kiddos. catch phase first month back school seems redundant. hope go back soon I'm still riding high  simple probability calculation like implied. come instead, probably would agreed first comment instead stupidly long comment chain insisted insulting intelligence.

No I'm specialist I've lot background 20s going chemical engineering degree minor biochemistry could go work Amgen facility making Enbrel. Ironically mother got sick RA attacking lungs stopped school help care passed. time opportunity go back, majority credits major minor expired gave idea rather try pursue 5 year degree late 30s lot room mutation still binding target.

Then also know there's lot room delirious mutations would actually kill virus instead allowing greater transmission lethality. mutation rate fairly constant whether mutation worth anything matters. bit complicated simple probability. failed mention he, along almost GOP congressmen, also got vaccinated. Lets get rest world vaccinated ü§î ‚ÄúFear keep line‚Äù local schools It. haven‚Äôt hear single school hasn‚Äôt done it. 30 there's barely difference catch it?  point make vaccines mandatory whole planet chuck human rights window name ending this?

I‚Äôm desperate Dude(tte). gotta stop bullshit. 

Point blank. misinformation like reason stretched long.

A) vaccine never ever advertised something makes immune getting sick COVID. help department, specifically aimed preventing Hospitalizations Death. far every vaccine 100% effective so.

B) really understand efficacy rate data derived. instance Pfizer Moderna luxury clinical trials lower infection rate J&amp;J. numbers provided start level ground... regardless... single hospitalization death vaccinated individual result vaccine COVID itself. (Not counting Delta variants, result vaccinated).

C) Failure vaccinate quickly results currently seeing. mutation virus resistant immune patchwork already developed... AKA even vaccinated people risk new variety... thanks allowing happen.

Maybe instead misunderstanding news articles, homework viruses work, different vaccines work world responding it. actually fascinating stuff. end boils this. thing, thing longer, things do.

We lucky ends vaccine possibly booster point. Another 7 8 million unvaccinated go Oh agree, can't get vaccines kids start school, masks mandatory sure. literally Ron DeSatan versus health risk procedures help save children educator's lives much f'd try block procedures threatening educators salaries. either completely brain washed beyond dumb thinks rest world seeing really is. Let's honest, right side conservatism mixed trumpism. Abbott probably like Rand, stands personally profit spread COVID.

No way understand it, really. Remember MS 70% vaccinated. like 35%. coastal counties, requested ship would useful, uh, red, unvaccinated. I‚Äôd worried Vermont needed help. Low vaccine uptake states struggling, kind expected. Saving content future use federal government ability overrule governors states making terrible decisions. Biden spoke yesterday reason said willing help least stay way. I'm aware, balance weighing educational needs safety. Mandating masks best middle ground, virtual option many people    husband risk genetic heart condition, never shown signs likely it. Apparently alone good enough get vax early. 

I work school got mine early. brought kinds ID whatnot prove worked school, long appointment one cared all. I'd imagine same. None republicans democrats like poor though. DeSantis like Americans. He's trying kill them. Makes one think something good Christian Americans. Trying kill families. would like laugh disbelief. what‚Äôs occur mask mandated states crime. never get open kissing booth rate. Superimposed infections uncommon. difference correlation causation? 
A correlation variables, however, automatically mean change one variable cause change values variable. Causation indicates one event result occurrence event; i.e. causal relationship two events. delta variant happening why? political answers please  multiple states asked hospital ships last time mostly unused.

and surge previous summer account changes testing/treatment yet wonder motorcycles banned roads. eligible adults get vaccinated Covid.

The hypothetical 1000 kids making full recovery. odds good (and close good), would different respiratory virus children.

The situation worrisome 1000 could serious disease. not, society wouldn‚Äôt care. 

To extent, care much Covid. one would done PCR testing asymptomatic mild cases infectious disease children. 

An unvaccinated child (excepting infants) less risk serious illness Covid vaccinated middle-aged older person. adults family vaccinated, try freak children. study shows mask work?

Please post. 48 million children 12. catch virus .2% die, thats 96,000 deaths. fish trash, lots thrown out. antibody test checks past infections? I've shortness breath 2 months. Got labs/tests came back healthy. 

I got JnJ shot March get shortness breath/minor cough til mid June. Negative covid rapid test late June, negative covid test last week. 

Wondering somewhere got covid long term effects sure even it, find did? picture sums argument agree. work school district schools. Last year hybrid online option. 70% came school. could distance 6ft keep hold things. student full time. There's way. stay community, either. Hubris. hope too. thought heard delta ‚Äúvirulent‚Äù well contagious‚Ä¶doesn‚Äôt inherently make dangerous misunderstanding term? vaccinating police support leading cause death police. 

I‚Äôm literally frightened pulled possible Covid exposure point. weeks past fear-mongering. Kids hospitalized alarming numbers return school going increase that.

Not mention inaccuracies comment. activated federal level. governor activates function like local militia rather arm US military. one remembers shit 100 years ago. one 100 years remember this. people barely remember 9/11 WW2. black plague wiped many barely remembered. grand scheme significant historical events isnt even blip. certainly got vaccinated - sure pushed way front line. Teenagers feel immortal underestimate risks younger kids stick canyons noses....so surprise here. Imagine US put ban Floridians. care us. crazy thing keep world making sense loser thinks state pays.

Last checked biggest tax bill school bill. exactly opposite. look China donated upto much orders Sinopharm actually fullfilled compared donations order fulfillment Pfizer, Moderna, JnJ Covishield among poorer countries.

Canada also big culprit ordered doses could vaccinate population five times essentially reduced chances donations countries put actual orders poorer countries massive backlog well mid 2022.

Its one big carnie bullshit. Likely hold court

Please, tell. law think violates?

The government right regulate businesses, including bars, restaurants, gyms.

People fundamental right enter establishments, discriminated many reasons--the exceptions members protected classes (e.g. race, sex, religion, sexual orientation).

""Unvaccinated"" protected class. sued personally! That‚Äôs money! overweight known factor covid19 ending hospitalized it. spend day elementary schools kids would pretty much guarantee teachers, vaxxed not, main source anything kids get. Kids cannot distance. suck masks. Even ones wear perfectly wear lunch even sitting apart friends talk occassionally hug get other's faces. brought home. Shit going get real.  This. Standards Reuters fallen much recently. wonder people screech ""fake news"" much lately. guess later year Delta slow Oh honey. You‚Äôre though. choose get vaccinated, you‚Äôre protected virus matter unvaxxed chose do. people fired vaccinated right?  know. Imagine growing mind? Sheesh. Things begin changing children start die. thought Facebook people saying vaccinated it? confused. Right. supporters begin attracted hatefulness vindictiveness conservative ideology. appeals worst society. drawn ideology reinforces anger hatefulness. They‚Äôre addicted drug awfulness. guess would time ready distribute would towards end Greek alphabet. I'm pretty sure said kids school, ALSO need address issues instead pretending exist parrot shit over..

Like doing.  sure fun time children grow long term health problems covid decide let millenials gen x die (even good part also fault boomers, dead then) responsible health adults. 

We better stewards children. schools Mississippi? Singulair immune suppressing drug time allergies That‚Äôs ‚Äúpro life‚Äù always huge misnomer. It‚Äôs pro forced birth. +1 year around school. Though work well highschool since kids want/need jobs summer. matter agree on. We're talking current reality situation. Eye protection importantly high risk settings, healthcare workers work covid patients. However, want wear eye protection community setting, safety glasses pretty I'm fairness think case referenced first two CVS second set Walgreens. know pharmacy state checking (or logging into) respective statewide databases, seem likely single company would pay attention records. 

It also probably easier couple months ago still state federal government run mass vax sites voluntary reporting would essentially give shots questions asked cover people like undocumented immigrants, name getting shots arms. I've seen people fb lost loved ones still say proud unvaxxed. blame death loved ones doctors. Said begged doctors give hydroxychloroquine bt doctors refused. reality. think even kids death gonna change assholes.

But Adults waiting FDA approval point absurd. vaccines approved governments world, many far better track record FDA comes protecting citizens harmful food drugs.

The thing stopping vaccines saving day right adults refusing get them. excuse Texans 50% vaccinated. try keep mind, lot loud idiots mean lot silent support too. It‚Äôs likely greater dosage, given enough data (population size). dosage distinctive difference two. use spike protein modified NIH similar lipid barriers.  blacks also getting vaccine low rates high death rates. vote dem. large medical centers US restricting non-essential travel physicians nurses. wonder requesting cutting elective procedures well. located? parents scheduled Germany Yeah well countries poor problems need help. issue immune suppressed people didn‚Äôt mount expected response vaccine. aren‚Äôt immune suppressed, probably expected response. isn‚Äôt giving extra protection risk groups.

Suck commies!

(I course, sarcastic. incredibly sad telling tale state country, proud say things like, ""hey we're better afghanistan!"". Yea man, like comparing American 3rd world countries saying we're better...ain't saying we're better...) believe you, makes absolutely sense. 

If we're pandemic induced emergency, need masks? orders Abbott saying cannot mandate masks, emergency, renders order unlawful. kids sacrificed *checks notes* ...make people like wearing piece cloth face happy?

I hate world. get vaccinated won‚Äôt get super sick die vaccine. True false LMFAO. Kids get sick 9 times year. Let alone mystery colds typical. 

5 million kids cold. ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ 

Also fine 1 kid dying? 1. vaccinated, still contract virus, however vaccinated helps fight disease much easily prevent grave illness. correct? &lt;--- yeah
2. true, individual vaccinated contracts virus, able infect people? &lt;--- yes
3. true, media narrative social pressure vaccinated about, danger un-vaccinated person poses themselves? &lt;--- former questions probabilities, bigger 0%, decreased. decreasing probability injection propagation decreasing probability worse variant delta arising. Yep. can‚Äôt wait companies start requiring vaccinations. It‚Äôs going fun watching peoples stupid little charade collapse instantly. they‚Äôll pariah themselves. Either seems fine. bike helmets  Since automod removed it. Biden election, trump tool even insinuating didn't. honestly could walk CVS doubt check Except there's huge divide kids parents time money keep learning disruption schools helping kids none that. falls almost exactly along lines kids *already* advantages. Vaccination rates also fall pretty closely along lines. going deepen divides already got certain former president elected. think goverment's role mandate restaurants must comply food health regulations prevent spread disease customers staff? kids 8 1. health care provider going give unapproved vaccine risk career.

HOPE IM WRONG. 

But Americentric view vaccines all. much world BARELY vaccinated. 

Mutations keep spreading. Lombada Peru. Epsilon Pakistan. 

I‚Äôm sure may have‚Ä¶.Zeta Botswana. Tango Krgystan (both fake examples) coming months years. 

The difference may sadly live fact us going get covid. One way another. seems unavoidable now. Even you‚Äôre vaccinated efficacy falling cliff Oxford researchers concluding vaccines dimly holding protection. 

All hope vaccinated get don‚Äôt long term effects either district? tracker? can't seem find updated numbers. Americans? Throwing tantrums? Oh, no, never! idiot's get wasting tax payer dollars losing court cases... oh ya, care spending long spending stupid bullshit. Give option getting vaccine jailed duration pandemic. We're going back before...   actually thought idea yesterday. vaccine-hesitant people, especially doubtful Covid's severity, spend hour touring Covid ward local hospital. Sorry making fun, PCR test known slow. takes days. rapid PCR one takes hours. require specialized equipment.

I believe meant raid antigen test, takes minutes, although less accurate PCR. like NYC spring 20'...do people ever learn. husband high risk remember hoping need go hospital anything urgent would able to. really polite people really warm welcoming... maybe brightest bulbs box, polite nice. mean, everything...  make claims factual 60% good uptake. Masks effective enclosed environment day. mention literally one leaves day, especially school. vaccine risks, vaccine risk free, risks lot lower disease itself. Myocarditis seems one like bring up, rarely happen vaccine, good bit likely happen getting COVID.  Oh no! Anyways.. Ding. aren‚Äôt 100% safe

We never 100% vaccines originally onky meant prevent severe/hospitalization, extremely well. Odds highly favor get Covid vaccine you‚Äôll fine.  Since difference phizer moderna vaccines largely dosage (and thus level neutralizing antibodies yield‚Äîmoderna larger dose, antibodies) follows third phizer dose raise immune response comparable (likely much greater) levels. kid *is* vaxxed, still insisting (and support it) wearing kn95 masks year. Luckily part NC mandate masks went back effect yesterday.

She's going person would been, covid thing. make decisions things life death even high school.

Stay safe, wish could do. think title supposed say ‚Äúunvaccinated areas‚Äù? That‚Äôs map shows, can‚Äôt see paywalled article. Otherwise, would pretty significant. think examples top head. school sends letters home lice outbreaks, local influenza outbreaks, norovirus outbreaks (stomach issues, diarrhea, etc), teachers sometimes communicate multiple kids class get strep throat. tell parents symptoms watch see Dr, well remind keep kids home symptomatic. 

Chicken pox 80s 90s also comes mind. Kids active symptoms sent home, still distinctly remember miserable 2 full weeks 4th grade it. I'm higher risk shingles. kids, however, risk memories missed school, headache fever, came it. there's vaccine chicken pox now. 

Compare covid. school district, least, kids active symptoms get sent home parents keep home begin with. kids likely remember sick miserable felt. They'll higher risk lifelong cardiovascular respiratory complications. problem is, kids eligible vaccine yet. masking keeping much distance possible school, distance learning possible, measures take help kids. reason couldn‚Äôt develop 90+ effective vaccine Delta? hard time getting new innumologist right unfortunately. agree vaccination (with mRNA vaccines, least) 88 percent effective preventing symptomatic disease caused Delta.

That's probably optimistic though :-(

There 5 studies mRNA vaccines prevented infection Delta. link provided best one, 4 say immunity wanes significantly, especially Pfizer probably Moderna trending  Vax blue smart people NYC/NJ still mask public. upgrading masks. People think mandating masks vaccines government control turn around support shit. Even sky comes falling
Even sun shine

Jeanette Nu√±ez lieutenant governor cuban heritage. Seriously? Let's say virtues always aligned. MeNtAL hEAlTh !! Isn‚Äôt whole VAMS portal? work way.

There's approximately 30,000 base pairs virus causes Covid. There's 4 different nucleic acids, giving 8.1 x 1017 possible permutations. exchanging one base another may produce change genetic material operates 3 base pair codons. codons code 20 amino acids many codons actually code amino acid. virus change, need change end point protein structure. also relevant structure protein. changes effect.

The spike protein example coded 3831 base pairs, 1277 amino acids. ones really matter amino acids active site protein attaches cells well control protein folding. single point mutation result change, change allows better binding, change allow less binding. protein fit like lock key, one change wrong point result protein even binding affects folding around active site available binding.

There's reason despite fact 200 million people infected, person producing millions billions viruses, Covid picks 1 2 mutations per month. every mutation beneficial, may actually kill virus codon stop codon ends translation useful protein keep mind Covid positive sense RNA skip transcription step. negative sense RNA, would need transcribed major source mutation. Pennsylvania, school board complete volunteer position, sure works Florida, though. envy anyone school board right now. evidence far suggests vaccine immunity stronger infection immunity, provides better protection multiple variants.

So no, antibody tests good. Records stored database (VAMS)  Nah, fact reposted twice good measure One added total, change someone's mind matters Get vaccine people! Also, don‚Äôt forget homemade cloth masks get because‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs science! AZ provides better cell response. may see tcells/ antibodies providing true protection severe disease. (TWIV experts also discussed given lack severe cases seen vaccinated immunocompromised individuals b-cell deficiency. cells still responding providing protection). Passing thru (in Portland now) socal. vaxxed. Masked indoors- Definitely see/feel pressure mask vs. Seeing vibe Grant's Pass Eugene (though stopped gas stretch legs parks outdoors) 

Different vibe California shifting towards masks slow despite urges. 

We're masking religiously keeping business outdoors possible. Ok.  example people changing behavior save humanity 1918 pandemic. cannot. everyone vaccinated much longer ""wear goddamn thing?"" went music festival either show negative test vaxxed (not lollapalooza) masks required.  show absolutely neccessary. costs fear ICE health care last resort illegal immigrants. legal status show soon hit rough patch. given average age immigrants legal illegal expect fill hospitals. 


Which course part appeal blaming them. Low health care access, fear deportation honestly argue young need hospital care. 


Desantis claim lacks evidence usual blame shifting excuses usual.   over-optimistic view US's reaction Spanish Flu. resistance wearing masks (such Anti-Mask League San Francisco) debates effectiveness. varying levels social distancing dependent city industry. debates whether schools closed not. weird medical procedures suggested/tried like gargling spraying nasopharynx electrolytic disinfectant fluid powder boric acid sodium bicarbonate.

That‚Äôs pretty shockingly high number. Could less testing? wish experts talks would look little closely results masking. writes lot places abandoned masking little impact high mask compliance previous waves (and masks stop earlier variants, good Delta?).

The big problem thing seems real impact spread telling people limit social contacts, means closing places people gather discouraging inter-household mixing. one wants more; one expert piece says high-spread states might want consider ""closing indoor dining limiting capacity events,"" nearly enough. 

I blame advocating would pointless; vaccinated people going stop social gathering, voluntarily-unvaccinated people never stopped. think one reason U.S. went vaccination sole tool masking turned make much difference, tools make difference longer feasible. That's simple. need weigh supply. Children approval time recommended booster could disaster supply, example.

Also, guidance may change time. example, may find advantageous mix shots- like got Pfizer getting Moderna vice versa. also may cause unforeseen issues.

It's still new situation information still changing constantly Ugh heartbreaking. 8 months pregnant vaccinated January hope able get booster FDA recommends (later today?) help boost immunity baby. need assertive policies like policy makers. way pandemic. Gym owners rebel lock downs. sure enforcing mandate. said support big time. thought rejoin gym summer definitely delaying Delta spike down. jogging good enough. policy change proposing? school? Also, school started August 5th, it‚Äôs doubtful tied school opening. yes, understand get worse. Oh, charter school. concentrated pool still fucking YUGE  cold would qualify getting sick, right? opinion, think Latam escape Delta variant? Looks like avoided Alpha. know two different beasts would nice could get spared. daughters started school classes California. Although schools take active precautions mandating masks, allowing parents &amp; visitors inside school daily disinfecting, keep getting notifications almost daily possible Covid case reported. daughter's teen friends vaccinated daughter waiting shot, however 10 year extra vigilant avoiding close contact always wearing mask. also taking vitamins extra C keep immune system strong possible.


My heart goes parents (and healthcare workers) please take care too. children need us healthy strong survive pandemic. definitely understand wanting newborn risk. son special needs, he's one can't get vaccinated yet, biggest worry. far avoided getting covid, see lasting way schools going.

I wish luck newborn, hope stay safe.  theme rooms! summer, lots people want go camping. Flu vaccine efficacy based guessing strains going show up. Sometimes good guess, times not.  going make employees enforcing? could dangerous. Delta variant transmission 1 infected person 5 others

Even worse - latest estimate delta variant [has R value around ‚ÄúWow can‚Äôt wait kids die‚Äù Said school board refusing mask mandate. ‚ÄúMe too‚Äù shouted parents agreement. 

Obv actually say might well would change policy? could 1000 dead children would still kept.

Everything I've seen seems focus viral load. sure would important, certainly seems like information viral shedding talked nearly much.

I wanted understand differences amount particle virus shed (not blood), contagious is, much air, differences vaccinated unvaccinated person. someone smarter help explain? mean I'm likely get virus exposed delta strain says 42% efficiency? complicated that? totally get you‚Äôre saying. However know families kids aren‚Äôt person year literally go homeless. scraping by. don‚Äôt money daycare jobs something done remotely.

Let's leave Moderna spring next summer.  would one thing FDA CDC institutions recommending vaccination. every single nation planet respectable federal health organization akin FDA, Finland Australia, saying vaccines safe.

Plus vaccinations required certain things 3rd dose obtained outside guidelines get tricky. course, personally think certain people go since benefit might worth it. People could've easily gotten vaccinated December determined (and yes know moral issue supplies then). drug fluvoxamine, aka Luvox. studies higher 30% children showing form long covid effects.

Still way better dying lack breathe though. I‚Äôm glad living Greensboro. county issued another mask mandate starting Friday.

We told April 2020 ""the peak"" would disappear, July 2020, Dec 2020... Florida hitting all-time highs new Covid cases every day week. Record numbers cases despite 50% vaccination rate.

Edit: Nothing comment, masks vaccines best way prevent spread, trust we've learned danger unsourced claims. great news make vaccinated person feel better outdoors unmasked crowd. you‚Äôve seen pictures extreme situation get environment.

Immunity single infection typically, reason, likely effective single infection + vaccination, CDC article linked shows.

This may true variants, since natural immune response creates antibodies immune memory entire surface virus. mutations occur across body virus, like delta, less immune memory identify virus whole. newer vaccines train body recognize spike protein part virus, seems give immune system better capability recognize virus, even mutates.  state actually took away option students go virtual. Completely took away! wait. Virtual fine till vaccine. Let's get moving. that‚Äôs thing fear motivation, I‚Äôm NYC first epicenter US told us you‚Äôre vaccinated go indoors without mask, meant going good summer enjoying freedom people normalcy back going restaurants, bars etc. hear delta variant south numbers started ticking NY delta, also cdc says vaccinated people get virus also pass mayor says ok it‚Äôs time start using masks didn‚Äôt mandated voluntarily guess happen started using masks believe fear going back bad months Covid ravaging city know masks social distancing help bring numbers down, I‚Äôm proud fellow Newyorkers that. taking care other. fellow North Carolinian, region county in?

I want see kids embalming table due negligence adults lives. many families received closure deserve. (Just get fucking shot wear mask ) many excuses come across selfish. Exactly. wish people would stop saying Covid vaccine developed quickly. mRNA technology cusp released, pandemic accelerated process. also, appears inevitable. Covid isn‚Äôt going anywhere. Good chance everyone earth catch point. Best thing anyone get vaccinated live healthy life. Thats best way beat covid. Masking, especially delta, isnt going thing unless people wearing N95s lets honest, kids arent going wearing those. Cite source, please?  explanation given doctor. says specs fit-tested mask. wondering effective someone throws 3 seconds way car grocery store. agree they're super effective hospitals, I'd question sending N95s everyone US terms efficacy, long last day-to-day use. 

That fact sheet seems agree cloth masks acceptable public use source control. think tell everyone need wear N95s, they'll stop wearing masks honestly getting good fit N95 pain butt lot people. hardly anyone dying going ICU.

Who cares many cases result? J&amp;J gang scrolling endlessly like ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt article since damn blood clot catastrophe.‚Äù wish info came J&amp;J, even AZ gets coverage us:( Pope vaccinated called ethical obligation.

That like saying, murder fine. every person safe themselves. Ummm, no. outlaw things dangerous society close impossible others protect themselves, cause societal harm... 

I almost control safety Texas. wear mask, large helps protect others, nearly much protect me. way protected others wear mask. 

I get vax, have, protects much. Delta high breakthrough percentage, flat want get Delta... live immunocompromised family member... best way stop people get vax.

The GOP argument beyond stupid. argument merit, also pro

1. police
2. laws anything. 
3. requirements insurance anything

It everyone one us right thing... Right? matter every black American knows it? think generational distrust institutions elders matter? 

They coming own, think USA culpability black community staggering take. doesn‚Äôt surprise me. Catholic Church far accepting science evangelical Protestant denominations Korea effectively island fair.

They're major global shipping hub. high levels international travel compared many nations extremely close ties China. fact able contain control virus early made difference ability isolate nations. familiar Atlantic Canada either, interest?

Same countries successful. took action cases low. Closed nonessential organizations minimized operations essential services. Issued enforced strick isolation quarantine measures. Implemented high levels testing. Established strong job protections sick/quarantined would enforced. Established social limitations enforced culturally fines extreme cases. Decisively imposed masking mandates tolerated non-compliance. fantastic job contact tracing high levels honest participation.

When cases low lifted restrictions care reenforced restrictions necessary. Love this. Hopefully Los Angeles next soon. literally told vaccines get us back normal experts knew we‚Äôre going get 80-90% vaccination coverage. vaccine mandates, boosters coming, children soon vaccinated...

But everytime hospitals shoot capacity like South, restrictions needed.

Everyone ignores part could years covid stops waves threaten regional health systems places refuse precautions. Wait till hurricane season really kicks in! thoughts effective JnJ is?

Having gone crowded places weekend I'm wondering effective JnJ given that's got months ago?

I Disney Universal Studios like month ago California delta new back then. 

Just wondering protected one JnJ delta spread. 

Thanks posted since NYT seems media outlet bothered follow story missing sequences made big news earlier. Maybe ending newsworthy (not sensation enough). What's obsession Israel?

Now what's percentage vaccinated passing along virus someone else? also people hate attack experts existence threatens fragile ‚ÄúI research‚Äù fake expertise bubble.

Their paranoia self-reinforcing. exists protect houses cards scary winds reality. Saying statements add paranoia like calling throwing lunch trash heap littering. 

Let‚Äôs clear positions wrong dangerous call are. Otherwise, thought hostages dumb, crazy people.  kinda figured would announce soon. really need look getting double vaccinated. I'm research study Novavax that's vaccine received. result, COVID-19 Vaccine Trial Participant Card. places accept card places don't. knowledge, Novavax applied EUA yet. Might look getting Moderna Wonder could make classes online except like, one class fewest students there. There, virtual. bring fact government coming take guns point fact going happen would've happened then. Democrats controlled everything believe barely type real gun restrictions put place. usually shuts while. got one dose Pfizer one dose Moderna 8 weeks apart. 5G signal solid 5 bars. Maybe standalone, there's kind support like stool bench? Yeah like this:
Rates infections schools delta variant with/without masks, with/without pcr testing, range existing curiosity - know much vaccination rates people 50 much higher younger people? got breakthrough case Moderna. I''m 42 year old man known health issues good shape. called doctor said half calls got antibody infusion breakthrough cases 2nd Moderna 50 breakthroughs week.

I pretty sick fever, chills, cough, congestion 3 days lost 7 pounds 185 start. I'm glad get Covid vaccinated think could much worse time it. strong reaction 2nd shot (bad chills, get bed day) thought must really worked lived life last 3+ months restrictions (shots March). 

I vacation prior weekend though drank bunch beers 3 days row beach bars think contributed immune response run smart retrospect. Anyway that's cautionary tale. really know proceed future. Like likely vaccinated breakthrough case predisposed getting predisposition health wise? much research there. Keep mind, Dan 'We grandparents sacrificed Covid save economy' Patrick next line Texas governor Abbott resigns.  true Basically risk. able prove transmissible surfaces. happened Maine too. got shot Micmac tribe there. really appreciated would wait longer otherwise. need support native populations. Even 1-5% magnitude value terms number people gigantic tried download paper, seems unavailable original link

I have... questions.

""Specifically, found typical elementary school without testing expect 70 percent students become infected within three months. middle high schools, 40 percent. Masks frequent testing halved numbers, however, giving school officials local policymakers valuable options ensuring upcoming schoolyear goes smoothly possible.""

What ""typical"" elementary school? parameters? much higher elementary middle/high school? basis estimate? many questions. 

My county 90% vaxxed 12. reduce this? much?

These kinds articles useful national level provide little guidance locally.    this. Market says I‚Äôll yay much, said I‚Äôve got 20, market said bite me! I‚Äôll go there. 

Anyone still job openings weeks time right offering little. Full stop. 

You‚Äôre paying enough. Dunno else say makes sense... it‚Äôs it.  There's self selection process going on: people going Sturgis much likely adhere public health guidelines vaccinated. People get reinfected new mutations. Natural Vaccine immunity lasts long. ANTI crowd going get Covid multiple times. I'm interested see cumulative effects. Got Covid problem. 6th time get 4 years. Still problem? rumors 5 fucking shots


What? think it'll give superpowers?  Abstract

 
Background 
Some Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients recovered acute infection experiencing mild symptoms continue exhibit persistent exertional limitation often unexplained conventional investigative studies. 
Research question 
What patho-physiological mechanism exercise intolerance underlies post-COVID-19 long haul syndrome following COVID-19 patients without cardio-pulmonary disease? 
Study Design Methods 
This study examined systemic pulmonary hemodynamics, ventilation, gas exchange 10 post-COVID-19 patients without cardio-pulmonary disease invasive cardiopulmonary exercise testing (iCPET) compared results 10 age- sex matched controls. data used define potential reasons exertional limitation post-COVID-19 cohort. 
Results 
Post-COVID-19 patients exhibited markedly reduced peak exercise aerobic capacity (VO2) compared controls (70¬±11%predicted vs. 131¬±45%predicted; p&lt;0.0001). reduction peak VO2 associated impaired systemic oxygen extraction (i.e., narrow CaVO2/CaO2) compared controls (0.49¬±0.1 vs. 0.78¬±0.1, p&lt;0.0001) despite preserved peak cardiac index (7.8¬±3.1 vs. 8.4¬±2.3 L/min, Additionally, post-COVID-19 patients demonstrated greater ventilatory inefficiency (i.e., abnormal VE/VCO2 slope: 35¬±5 vs. 27¬±5, p=0.01) compared controls without increase dead space ventilation. 
Interpretation 
Post-COVID-19 patients without cardiopulmonary disease demonstrate marked reduction peak VO2 peripheral rather central cardiac limit along exaggerated hyper-ventilatory response exercise. want travel again. long restrictions international travel cant wipe hands teacher hi - 5ing student this? intent portion definition, unless they've expressed intent make sort political, religious, military gain so. reckless endangerment unless there's evidence intended attack service goal  trusting COVID vaccine Tuskegee I'm going chalk mistrust.

You act recent mistrust born ignorance one built generations substandard/dismissive treatment medical establishment whole. Please let true‚Ä¶please let true‚Ä¶ Good point lol.
Hopefully bikers mostly vaccinated. mean, can‚Äôt afraid vaccine side effects ride motorcycles‚Ä¶ similar #2 quite sure want third one. really, really sick week second one basically reaction first one. So, reaction gets progressively stronger, don‚Äôt know poor body handle third shot. helpful, never ever US someone‚Äôs freedom meant could kill someone else negligence. 

Yes freedom kill alcoholism. don‚Äôt freedom drive drunk kill people.

It‚Äôs exact vaccines.  safe effective vaccine freely available. vaccinating point pure negligence part. don‚Äôt freedom go negligently infect people deadly virus.  almost feels like twiddling thumbs point, wasting time children starting school NOW. Authorize emergency use let parents make decisions given possible risks. I'd wager many parents would risk biscuit. Yeah, tiny percentage people can‚Äôt get vaxed‚Ä¶ shouldn‚Äôt going bars shows restaurants right now. sucks, feel them, that‚Äôs huge amount risk.

Personally, don‚Äôt think exception, would hard actually verify (and lead lot abuse.) can‚Äôt get vaxed, can‚Äôt engage high risk activities, you.

If everyone else would get vaccinated, wouldn‚Äôt even issue them. dental records! fuckin means, let‚Äôs require masks school. previous eua timelines held case, hand data September 1st eua could come October 1st-ish. Obviously could go longer faster depending rigorous want reviewing dire feel situation become. Would great get done next 4-6 weeks though, fingers crossed!

It‚Äôs making sure SARS-CoV-2 doesn‚Äôt bring us knees again.‚Äù**

I think great response comments read sub people ""done pandemic precautionary measures got shots."" Oh God, know said wanted slam head car door. It‚Äôs like saying ‚Äúthere many birds outside, close blinds birds disappear‚Äù üíÄ

Gather want *outside* greatly reduced (nearly eliminated?) transmission. inside, could strongly encouraging people businesses improve ventilation systems. bonus, solution helps every repository disease, known unknown!

Sure, nothing's good isolating one contact anyone potentially infected, still recommending people limit contacts wear masks inside. But, realistically, people going continue gather; talking gather safely. ""Hi, I'm first shot"" Yeah, I'm really venting. pandemic sadly destroyed long held belief majority people sensible well intentioned. I'm certain 30% live see others suffer another 30% stupid warrant opinion. spend much time advocating greater good, need kind figuratively spit face. understand people‚Äôs circumstances change right?

I feel like case put money teaching methods work better remote environment. basically, 'here go' training substandard environments. Nice COVID-19 deaths per capita US 51 times higher Australia. 

The two countries experienced roughly equivalent economic contraction 2020. mouth? Like Ace Ventura? Russia 360000 excess deaths last year, well 1k daily. ah see favor things unless create inconvenience Shit's real already. Mississippi setting hospital beds *parking garages* bringing federal emergency staff help care patients. medical system edge. What's even point going take covid test care results?   Yes accent mark = for√™ign √®xot√≠c Right now, parent ill afford take time work, thinking temorary insanity defense usually take personal insult like ""You think would get baby sick purpose?!"" ""You think I'm stupid enough visit sick?!"" variations occasional ""All kids got (insert disease) kids we're fine, probably good immune system."" already know downvoting this...    vaccines work working. pushed $$$ working properly variants. I‚Äôve heard doctors recommend it, well many saying wait take it. medical professional doesn‚Äôt mean can‚Äôt persuaded give something don‚Äôt know side affects something rushed emergency authorization nobody knows right decision yet. 

‚ÄúYoung healthy‚Äù way medical issues different, covid rarely kills people young healthy.. that‚Äôs fits here. I‚Äôm vaccines, lot covid seems off. I‚Äôm going use right American wait vaccine actually figured out, chances dying covid probably less vaccine I‚Äôm going wait. LA first school go back remote since they'll actually know bad is. Nonsense. approved vaccines time supply limited. Supply longer issue. thousands doses going waste every day millions storage. Supply issue. Florida keeps changing reporting. 4 deaths reported yesterday stay there, increase weekly report comes out.

They're fudging numbers make look better see people get welded homes.  It‚Äôs breakthroughs exceedingly rare hospitalizations deaths rest us? 

Are fully vaccinated immunocompromised? so...I think data off. Thousands fully vaxxed healthy people dying. regular 2 dose vaccine GREATLY reduces chances severe disease/hospitalization, reduces chance death even more. article responses collected Facebook surveys. April 2021. Texas, sentenced twice air force. terrible place. people elected office, even make stupid people look smart.  That‚Äôs great way make people stop taking Covid tests sick lol. Florida 22 million people. around 22k per day, would take roughly 1000 days every single citizen test positive. Even take vaccinated people equation, know accurate, half state, 500 days. 

Factor people getting going get test around 1 year every single unvaccinated Floridian citizen tested positive covid. 

All rough estimates course, but... Yea sucks Florida right now. ""Love thy neighbor*""

*Neighbor defined straight, white, liberal think challenge people relying frontline employees enforce stuff. That‚Äôs fair sure fights violence right true, really need targeting information campaigns demographic. telling you, people getting COVID post-vaccination saying walk park. Shit hurts worst flu. also run risk Long Covid.

Well sounds terrible. got positive test today despite second jab done two weeks ago. I'm starting feel it. :( right here. serious consequences, people keep this. Sometimes, people (such myself) are/were busy get shot. travel lot work side effects could've potentially sidelined couple days question (some people know felt like absolute crap couple days #2). Thankfully, things slow enough get jabs days ""just case time"". course, mine (much like others) came sore arm mild headache, ""worries"" moot, people really busy. Yes have. beginning pandemic, nearly every single state released metrics would qualify defeating virus.

And nearly every single state abandoned metrics reopened early people like OP.

And morons didnt get vaccinated restarted whole thing.

This rocket surgery. sooner OP stops crying masks people like stop spreading misinformation, sooner everyone else stop crying losing loved ones get back lives. They've expanding. However, considering lag new cases hospitalizations, high numbers remained last week, probably going get lot worse gets better hospitals. 

Severe covid often long hospital stay, can't really roll old roll new. There's going lot overlap. real silver lining hospitalizations lower year ago (as rate, necessarily total) old people vaccinated. still, get enough cases, we'll get enough hospitalizations run space. live rural Tennessee well, Warren County, vaccination rate atrocious. hate here. willful ignorance driving insane. zero chance wide scale shutdowns That‚Äôs great, seems like good move  Yes kids, teachers staff get tested weekly LAUSD schools. Moderna Pfizer shown 3rd dose increase neutralizing antibody levels delta 20 fold. That's enough bring back efficacy 95+% hefty discount vaxxed, there's profits had. browse Teacher subreddit see mention there. longer get sick days covid like last year use little days get quarantine prob show sick. say, doesn‚Äôt seem extreme mother-in-law fully vaccinated since December Pfizer tested positive yesterday. gone wedding, fully vaccinated bride mother bride tested positive symptomatic breakthrough infections (they informed guests, good them) decided get tested. symptoms point. live highly vaccinated state US.

The kind failure ICU beds staff run them. nurse doctor physically care certain number patients. severe staffing shortage, caused plethora things, lead cases hospital space people. results still (people may survived instead died) caused shortage people willing able provide support.

Lastly, there's failure material equipment. saw NYC get real close well, hospitals trouble getting oxygen. also lack ventilators PPE start pandemic enough. enough equipment, matter beds staff. less problem lot stuff know need manufacturing mobilized produce lot products already. is, however, still major problem countries India.

Why still happening? Hospitals actually make money pandemics - ramp lot staff areas normally (you can't put ol' person ICU, need training) staffing costs go also lose income made non-pandemic events like elective surgeries such. 

The staff also getting absolutely wiped never ending marathon exhausting work. long hours full bad endings good ones dealing ungrateful patients family members largely deny virus real. Medical personnel humans humans cannot maintain constant strain. time know ""support heroes"" line BS. Work 80 hour weeks months get free T-Shirt reduction part time hours (and pay) Hospital get back profitability (while CEO getting praised TV interviews receiving multimillion dollar bonuses).

So yeah, there's lots kinds collapse US seen different types different times. better material shortage collapse, much worse staffing collapse... one solved spinning factories.

0.0004% 385k (1/10 385k) 15 cases round want.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* PH. Government shoving Sinovac faces. got fights taking sinovac ""best vaccine one available"" BS. Now, hoping would get moderna vaccine lobbied someone me. 


Here reasons refuse take Sinovac (or AZ) 


1. Sinovac, protect us severe infection death 90-100%, yes. cannot prevent infection much, almost 50%, mRNA vaccines give much 90-95% prevention infection
2. Sinovac overpriced vaccine really wisest choice government did. like take procured personal interests.
3. mRNA vaccines gives many side effects Sinovac claims doesnt minimal side effects. me, side effects vaccine has, potent was. understand main goal vaccine prevent severe deadly infection. better vaccine prevents infection significant %
4. Sinovac immediate side effects kinda fishy me
5. Sinovac came country known poisoning kids people thru products
6. Sinovac doesnt VAERS.

I would blame mRNA vaccine countries despite surge wearing mask anymore. It‚Äôs really surprising. group isn‚Äôt vaccinating. group also isn‚Äôt liberal Reddit likes act. They‚Äôre highly religious

I know it‚Äôs completely anecdotal three families street Hispanic Trump signs yard OP say that. can't deny either even people business parents raising innocent children. There's reason pretty much everyone go therapy life. would FEMA able offer? 
Genuine question. Send overall effectiveness effectiveness specific variants? vote maybe even say citizens too. BNT = **B**io**nt**ech, company developed vaccine also manufactured distributed Pfizer.

ChAdOx = **Ch**impanzee **Ad**enovirus vaccine developed **Ox**ford university, manufactured AstraZeneca side effects reported examined, can't see media that's nothing report. Nobody reporting unicorns either, also exist.

Have read millions people dead incapacitated COVID? Life hasn‚Äôt meaningfully changed? crazy? Six months ago everything still closed.   Got Moderna January February. chose it, it‚Äôs offered ""Great things small beginnings."" think became ""political""...I feel like vaccines vaccines...like tetanus, get asked other...people get &amp; things hopefully get bettter...like polio, smallpox etc. get vaccine would could. know made sense maybe cause FDA approve yet too?  Yeah, feels hopeless we‚Äôre reacting every new variant point one agrees how/when/if pandemic end

In Virginia don‚Äôt wear masks even delta - it‚Äôs recommended pretty much one anymore. - I‚Äôm hoping last major wave thanks lots infections give immunity vaccines. It‚Äôs annoying going positive 2-3 months many media especially acting like it‚Äôs apocalypse. 

Plus booster shots children getting vaccines soon

But yeah, plan right vaccinate people let‚Äôs see happens. know everyone get vaccinated matter do. Everyone kind hoping delta infectious maybe it‚Äôs worst wave final wave.  $750 per month especially college environment!

Remember, they're begging vaccine die, clearly they're repenting getting anyone know long term effects also common people vaccinated get covid? Could link never even thought that! seems lots people though, I‚Äôm looking bit. feel bad people *can't* get COVID-19 Vaccine, really do, but...

There point treat COVID-19 personal health problem, move on. medical doctors say young healthy people ‚Äúsurvive‚Äù something, doesn‚Äôt mean walk away zero lasting effects. Motorcycle helmets increase accident survival rates lot survivors paralyzed, horribly disabled, missing limbs, vegetable. 4 outcomes = survived.

People need remember even 100% survival rate doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôll 100% original self. guy got Moderna March too. eligible industry I'm in. learning live virus!!   Mind fucking blown really don‚Äôt understand governor change budget own. seems like it‚Äôs set stone that‚Äôs unless law change. change without approval? Federally congress controls money goes what‚Äôs equivalent state level? Makes sense, pharmacies spoke said use drivers licenses. family member refused concerned gave info, pharmacy would able see 2 already. said license, told get lost.

Your realization fact evidence smarter lot people breeding. Hi, I'm Frontline healthcare worker covid AMA.

I tested weekly also work CMS regulated nursing homes. tested 50 times now, never positive, even husband caught it. sure Germany evaluate it, would remain cautious around UK reason. Oh wait. get staying late. You‚Äôre sarcastic idiot. want one low life‚Äôs sign stat dec claiming won‚Äôt take hospital bed get covid. Personally, don‚Äôt deserve one. mean... vaccination rates minority communities, predominantly liberal, exactly great either. disagree sentiment.  pets? know they're safe, too? Based.  mean.....they kind made bed one I‚Äôll keep smoking weed every-day case friend said met kid ""they let one!"" document left behind former president gameplan combating similar things politicians scramble milk disaster everything can, lose. Fine now. 

But need single case community we're screwed. vaccine rollout taken far long get going. going ask ‚Äòduck duck go‚Äô yea mainly mammals. Camels livestock Sort of. mayo clinic. birds fish? ones I‚Äôm worried about. =) Hybrid shown increase case counts though, options. kids school part time different daycares patched together unregulated daycares.  
But right, ton states burned goodwill keeping schools closed, even seemed pretty safe open. Particularly states like california oregon. could closed strategically, face huge problems close schools third year running. keep several test kits home. two young kids daycare, one two. parent knows, really young ones pick everything bring home pass around. sick twice 2 months, times everyone else home gotten sick. break test kits run couple make sure whatever baby brought home it‚Äôs Covid.  added tomorrow (Thursday)  That's one thing. Ability contract transmit virus despite vaccination also significant. better go per capita, florida still way lower many states, including own. yet outbreak tiny compared florida. scaring me. covid right really hope don‚Äôt get ventilator‚Ä¶ population survive over. 

That's fallacy.

98% survival assuming everyone needs hospitalization oxygen access things. Even measures taking now, hospitals overrun, ER wait times roof, ventilators oxygen hot commodity. 

If everyone sick once, flat run oxygen. [See trying control infections would catastrophic. imagine getting car wreck dying hospital beds help you? heart attack able seen hospital can't triage patients fast enough tell chest pain different guy chest pain coughing? imagine dying sepsis ER waiting room time 36 hours thought could tough infected wound home? tumour getting evaluated late treat, medical imaging equipment backed covid patients scans lower priority? covid deaths, EVERYONE needs medical care suffers Covid influx goes up.

Healthcare pushed beyond limits year. collapse without outbreak measures. cannot express many colleagues retired last year. Every doctor know talking early retirement leaving acute care. Nurses always understaffed critically understaffed, like $20k sign bonus understaffed. cannot healthcare without staff, staff situation gets worse rather better. everyone suffers access medical care. haha know, even though kids completely understand that. I've really long conversations one best friends, I've heard say something affect somewhat frequently.  Right... What's point though? change anything. got J&amp;J ....but still double mask hope keep safe....i locked year half cant go back stay safe son.  Yes, we‚Äôre vaccinated keep passing around mild versions virus build natural immunity it, won‚Äôt essentially become another common cold? That‚Äôs one POV I‚Äôve heard keeps semi-sane what‚Äôs happening! nobody covering US? One biggest elements ignorance refusal acknowledge long term damage that's already popping example putting athletes disabled lists. feel like whole ""fully protected 2 weeks final dose"" messaging probably best. J&amp;J takes longer time reach max protection tell people THAT. compare vaccines using ""days fully vaccinated"" vaccine, ""effectiveness 2 weeks regardless specific vaccine timeline"".

Knowing mess current system US right now, could go back time, would gotten J&amp;J (instead Pfizer) early April, waited delta started throwing wrench things, lied status gotten mRNA ~July.

At point CDC zero credibility me, whatsoever. I'm extremely pro-vax feel like they're taking us responsible, non-science-denying-morons granted pander antivaxxer audience never convinced either way.  authoritarian That's anecdotal though. Studies across board shown opposite true. Moderna saw adverse reactions, makes sense given increased dosage chose. paying people got though. Everyone take Rapid PCR test, even they're vaccinated. could asymptomatic. half measures. initial reservoir (though bats assumed everyone) intermediate host (the lab leak conjecture assumes muskalids, zoonotic jump conjecture credible idea) found.

Many new reservoirs created pandemic, making research initial reservoir/intermediate likely impossible low value. blunt day keeps doctor away Businesses fatigued government shut   sounds like difficult‚Äîand delicate‚Äîsituation. I‚Äôm sorry go that.

It‚Äôs baffling someone degree (pun unintended) education overlooking data decision making. sad thing vaccine politicized communities vaccine skepticism required feel welcomed/a sense belonging.

As far advice goes, suggestion would A) make sure nothing word choice/tone comes condescending/disrespectful/judgmental‚Äîvery difficult situations‚Äî B) listen address specific concerns/doubts. People hesitant feel way reasons seem perfectly logical them, perhaps try Socratic/Street Epistemology approach.

 Second, Wolfgang kubucki practiced right people make decision comes vaccination - exactly US country carries themselves. addition, Wolfgang Kubicki anti-vaxxer vaccinated? believe take away need reevaluate difference contesting whole.  

Lastly judging previous response covid-19,
I tell bit skewed bias comes covid news.
Likewise, I'm sure thought process even begin with.... shoehorned word ""penis"" part argument....
I'm going limb state fact antivaxxer feel personally attacked people's satire opinions. Likewise, take week two reddit ease mind brother/sister.  getting this? feel like literature I‚Äôve seen points fact outdoor transmission exceptionally rare. hasn‚Äôt single outdoor super spreader event. idea sarcasm, trolling, serious? vaccine, masks, get bumps along way. Quick question (and hopefully answer too). fully vaccinated person, still likely contract virus before, protection I‚Äôm really getting milder symptoms if/when contract (ie lower death rates vaccinated vs unvaccinated)? Consequence culture gone far! lists pretty clearly, study authors thought limitations study. reinfection confirmed whole genome sequencing, would necessary definitively prove reinfection caused distinct virus relative first infection. Although cases repeat positive test could indicative prolonged viral shedding failure clear initial viral infection (9), given time initial subsequent positive molecular tests among participants study, reinfection likely persons vaccinated possibly less likely get tested. Therefore, association reinfection lack vaccination might vaccine doses administered federal out-of-state sites typically entered KYIR, vaccination data possibly missing persons analyses. addition, inconsistencies name date birth KYIR NEDSS might limit ability match two databases. case investigations include questions regarding vaccination, KYIR might updated case investigation process, vaccination data might likely missing controls. Thus, might even favorable although case-patients controls matched based age, sex, date initial infection, unknown confounders might present. Finally, retrospective study design using data single state 2-month period; therefore, findings cannot used infer causation. Additional prospective studies larger populations warranted support findings.

&amp;#x200B;

What draw business, certainly see anything remotely approaching 'proof' natural immunity inferior immunity gained vaccination. extra week doses another major difference. think still studying topic. is, whether vaccines waned (A) general effectiveness going due vaccine (B) ongoing delta variant posing slight resistance‚Äîbut significantly‚Äîagainst vaccine  write long book ways institutions failed us pandemic, FDA requiring three times many months data collection children‚Äôs vaccine adult vaccine got completely missing start school year chapter. 

We lucky kids start getting vaccinated halfway flu season. I'm thinking thing. peak summer going way higher peak last summer. assume true winter's peak.

If end keeping schools open, probably going charts winter. Hope I'm wrong. hours yeah, lot adults interact people direct household almost day. vaccine still extremely effective preventing infection altogether. Depending data look 75%-95% never get infected covid period, including asymptomatic able get vaccine? like 6 months since available. 30 year old female. little fatigued day after, nothing major! Exactly. they're comparable chances dying COVID increase due many times get per year, like riding car. either get get it, either die don't.  Wearing mask already vaccinated may seem pointless-- child, friend's child, grandchild, niece, etc., can't get ICU non-Covid treatment full children Covid. father dies heart attack waiting ambulance they're backed transporting Covid patients. schools might forced close again...

When happens, ,maybe understand wearing mask even vaccinated makes sense. Maybe much sense 50% population actually getting vaccinated...

Masks never entirely preventing Covid infections. Masks keeping infection rate manageable level waited vaccine solution. Delta, unvaccinated, pretty clearly showing us failed, without masks, keep infection rate manageable level. States like Florida piss poor ignorant leadership condemning state unnecessary loss life eternal economic hardship. again, medical experts proven correct. certainly depend area, places (such hard hit states) daily decrease Rt see light end tunnel end month. Unless I'm mistaken make sense consistent decrease Rt spanning month see spike cases 6-weeks. slower Rt means virus starting burn less people infect. course, could also depend places lag reporting time. I'll agree thing odds increasing getting larger. That's particular variant favored others. able eradicate Flu, would COVID different? Huh? says (don't get wrong hope thats case see single data scientist saying so) got priority group due asthma squeeeeeeking barely BMI threshold, giving two risk factors. didn‚Äôt ask proof got shots.

""outdoors magic"" became new ""six feet magic"" mean actually magic. going find smoking gun study that's ethical/the nature airborne illnesses makes tracing hard anyway, nobody could seriously look evidence say can't spread signifcantly outside.

1. Common sense. There's nothing special outside. windy there's better airflow modern AC system windy there's less amount airflow modern AC system. significant, effect overestimated most.

2. Aerosol transmission accepted mechanism spread. Smoke smelly aerosol everybody lot experience with. smell someone smoking cigarette, infect covid. can't tell straight face able smell smoke say, outdoor concert everyone smoking.

3. [Covid transmission significantly correlated hot, low wind exactly expect airborne virus get spread outdoors. Also keep mind time period largely large outdoor gatherings.

There argument made keep outdoor stuff open convince people rather break restrictions indoor stuff, that's different argument akin ""vaccinated need wear masks"" gamble completely backfired. actually true polling. Check facts! also makes sense given governments history experimenting blacks sterilizing large numbers blacks.  really. likely allergies. understand people never feel like idiots. someone office thing, saying going disappear election. Even saying ""see, vaccine happened right election.""

I idea still come work wrong something vocal about.  Actually, UK seems picking cases slowly last couple weeks. Though still quite bit earlier peak.

Although least 80 percent people 65 older vaccinated United States, surging cases could still present elevated risk them. possible, epidemiologists said, seniors people compromised immune systems could particularly vulnerable surge, even fully vaccinated, bodies might produce strong immune response vaccine.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre seeing pretty dramatic spillover effect transmission community vulnerable parts population,‚Äù Thomas Dobbs, Mississippi‚Äôs state health officer, said last week, though emphasized higher proportion breakthroughs mean vaccine become less effective.

A need better data

A lack comprehensive data, paired growing concern Delta variant, may helping drive fears breakthrough infections.The C.D.C. provide data breakthrough instances state local level, provide data time, makes difficult see fully vaccinated people may becoming vulnerable virus certain areas.

The agency, along states, stopped tracking mild breakthrough cases May, focusing instead breakthrough infections result hospitalization death. decision recently garnered criticism several lawmakers, argued detailed information infections critical understanding virus behaving.

Several epidemiologists told Times collecting comprehensive data mild cases nearly impossible infected may mild symptoms bother getting tested (or may symptoms all).

‚ÄúMost breakthrough cases diagnosed tend mild like cold,‚Äù said Dr. Chighaf Bakour, assistant professor epidemiology University South Florida, explaining cases diagnosed would likely moderate severe people would seek testing treatment.

But epidemiologists said better data local level could help public health experts identify problems ‚Äî including dangerous transmissible variants, also flaws vaccine storage manufacturing.

Beyond that, said critical understand breakthrough cases might affecting different demographic populations ‚Äî including different age groups racial groups, groups received different vaccines, groups received vaccines earlier year versus later year. That, said, important keeping virus bay.

‚ÄúThe data access; collect data,‚Äù said Debra Furr-Holden, Michigan State epidemiologist associate dean public health integration. ‚ÄúAt point, trying eradicate Covid. trying figure mitigate impact.‚Äù

Methodology

The Times asked 50 states Washington, D.C., provide data breakthrough infections, hospitalizations deaths fully vaccinated people, roughly spanning back first months vaccination campaign end 2020 beginning 2021. Many states provided data June July, may account recent surge Delta variant infections. every state providing information, hospitalizations deaths among fully vaccinated people accounted small minority totals.

Forty-four states, plus Washington, D.C., shared breakthrough hospitalization death information Times, though provided two months less records. states ‚Äî Connecticut, Hawaii, Maryland Wyoming ‚Äî excluded analysis. Three additional states ‚Äî Iowa, Missouri Pennsylvania ‚Äî said unable provide data breakthroughs systems effectively track them. Florida, Kansas New York provide data breakthrough hospitalizations deaths.

The states define breakthrough cases different ways provided data different periods, exercise caution making comparisons. count fully vaccinated people tested positive virus, even symptoms, others not. considered case breakthrough person fully vaccinated 14 days more. states said know hospitalization status breakthrough infections received data subset hospitals. states said breakthrough data preliminary subject change.

Some hospitalizations death records lacked vaccine status altogether. Data individuals fully vaccinated includes partially vaccinated people, unvaccinated people, people unknown vaccination status.

Aug. 10, 2021
Serious coronavirus infections among vaccinated people relatively rare since start vaccination campaign, New York Times analysis data 40 states Washington, D.C., shows. Fully vaccinated people made 0.1 percent many 5 percent hospitalized virus states, 0.2 percent many 6 percent died.

There still lot know so-called breakthrough infections ‚Äî fully inoculated people contract virus. evidence cases becoming common transmissible Delta variant surges. vaccines done remarkable job protecting vast majority people serious illness, data Times analysis generally spanned period start vaccination campaign mid-June July, Delta variant became predominant United States.

Breakthrough Covid-19 Hospitalizations Deaths State

Note: Arkansas provide counts breakthrough hospitalizations deaths, West Virginia provide count breakthrough hospitalizations.

Data less serious breakthrough infections widely available, though possible cases rising. Data available several states virus surging, including Florida Missouri.

Until recently, Centers Disease Control Prevention estimated fully vaccinated people accounted less 3 percent coronavirus hospitalizations nationwide less 1 percent virus deaths. last week, agency noted figures reflect new data involving Delta variant said actively working update them. 50 percent people United States fully vaccinated.

Looking many hospitalizations deaths involved fully vaccinated people common crude measure well vaccines working.

As people get shots, percentage hospitalizations deaths among fully vaccinated people rise. may seem counterintuitive, it‚Äôs important understand why.

In state high vaccination rate, higher percentage breakthroughs may simply reflect fully vaccinated people bigger chunk population, hospitalizations deaths overall. Imagine state two people hospitalized vaccinated ‚Äî breakthroughs would account 100 percent hospitalizations state, even though cases rare.

Assessing breakthrough rates

Some epidemiologists state health officials instead recommend comparing likely vaccinated person hospitalized die, compared unvaccinated person.

To this, Times used number breakthroughs vaccination rate time estimate rates hospitalizations deaths group every state data available.

In states, people fully vaccinated hospitalized Covid-19 least five times often fully vaccinated people, according analysis, died least eight times often.

While probably true exact thing could said US government. RESULTS
Effectiveness one dose vaccine (BNT162b2 ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) notably lower among persons delta variant (30.7%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 25.2 35.7) among alpha variant (48.7%; 95% CI, 45.5 51.7); results similar vaccines. **With BNT162b2 vaccine, effectiveness two doses 93.7% (95% CI, 91.6 95.3) among persons alpha variant 88.0% (95% CI, 85.3 90.1) among delta variant.** ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine, effectiveness two doses 74.5% (95% CI, 68.4 79.4) among persons alpha variant 67.0% (95% CI, 61.3 71.8) among delta variant.
CONCLUSIONS
Only modest differences vaccine effectiveness noted delta variant compared alpha variant receipt two vaccine doses. Absolute differences vaccine effectiveness marked receipt first dose. finding would support efforts maximize vaccine uptake two doses among vulnerable populations. (Funded Public Health England.)

The majority us stepped forward got shots. We're tired waiting, time society continue without them.

School opening light up. Like stepping bear trap. Damn. mention servers America paid largely tips, opposed pretty much every country. Again, two comments replied said odds increase, chance. chances increase, odds. think it‚Äôs important note reasons we‚Äôre seeing nurses refuse protest vaccine mandate. 

1. advocate patients make informed decisions care. patient right refuse life saving care blood (religious reasons example), surgeries more. medical rights nurses taken away still encouraged advocate patient‚Äôs right refusal case, still need care others may unvaccinated. 
2. Nurses endured extreme hardship height pandemic called heroes. Throughout time many receive hazard pay even proper PPE even though begged it. still expected show exposed covid without protection. Now, forced receive medical treatment lose job. showing work face death everyday little assistance. 
3. assume many nurses exposed covid covid already. haven‚Äôt researched seems likely me. understand natural antibodies effective reinfection. Yes, vaccination natural immunity combined shown effective significant amount. also interpret evidence based data make decisions. FDA approval, evidence contradicts bit natural immunity add conclusion vaccine may worth them. 

Yes, vaccines required employment public schools vaccines studied years target non-RNA viruses. places require employee wear mask refusing flu vaccine. think weekly testing + ppe viable option don‚Äôt want receive vaccine. vaccinated spreading individual health choice.

Polio exceptionally rare now, eradicated. Eradicated refers zero known cases, simply massive reduction. get point importance vaccination agree completely vaccination have, fewer cases manageable disease overall. never dispute. you‚Äôre operating assumption reach eradication COVID, I‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs extremely unlikely, it‚Äôs even possible ‚Äî least, foreseeable future. entire state Kentucky May 1, 2021 June 30, 2021 found 246 people 1) registered positive lab test coronavirus 2) registered positive lab test year 2020. 246, 172 people state's database full vaccinations versus 74 were.

The sample size small time period state population. That's significant enough conclude much higher likelihood getting reinfected vaccinated.

I hope people relying previous lab-verified infection keep getting sick persuaded get vaccinated evidence like this. certain studies come back up. can‚Äôt see parents putting tbh. Everyone know hated passion Meanwhile got Alberta Kenney Hinshaw much better. July 8th longer needed negative COVID test travel Hawaii vaccinated. 

Whoever made decision blew it, likely due lack information information questioning effectiveness vaccines getting wiped society. Cough, fatigue, back aches, loss smell &amp; taste, fever, sore throat hand rash new symptom me.

Back aches worst couple days. Hand rash scared aware affects people. Everything mild.

I good go 10 days first symtpom (cough). Even smell taste started return 10 days. seems incredibly unlikely me. Like ‚Äústatistical zero.‚Äù close humanly possible. find doubting know multiple people happened to. poliovirus eradicated continents except Asia, 2020, Afghanistan Pakistan two countries disease still classified endemic. Completely agree. I‚Äôm parent nervous sending kid school, get you‚Äôre saying risk here, talking 1.8% children *symptomatic * Covid, according OP‚Äôs sources make 50% known cases. it‚Äôs actually less 1/100, that‚Äôs you‚Äôre talking known cases. Many children asymptomatic covid never diagnosed. So, least based data OP presented, don‚Äôt think comparison accurate. I‚Äôm comparing severity Covid things, society every single year illnesses like flue, RSV, norovirus. We‚Äôve seen they‚Äôre preventable precautions people don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worth Ask antivaxxers. religion. lawyer sounds like ACA restricts base premium increases (age, location, smoking, individual vs family, plan category). It‚Äôs nearly bad last summer sure it‚Äôs wanted be.

I wanted see mostly maskless people near return normalcy.

Guess it‚Äôs next year hopefully. spike proteins cleaned immune system, there's ""shedding"", that's insane. shedding, virus would it. MIS-C well understood, pretty rare, believe originally thought Kawasaki Syndrome. associated infection, vaccines. Make unvaccinated students pay regular covid testing.  

And, miss exam failed covid test right exam week, fail course.  countries already seem (at least inmediately) big backlash something. mean protests agaisnt whole rule, practice destroy business.

I know long run, tho. likely flexible. sneezing often one common symptoms COVID? people supposed get real valid experiences? get it. people lying bad Experiences. motivation? gaining? don‚Äôt know sure - best drive absolutely nuts think.

Just letting know - wouldn‚Äôt starting (that‚Äôs incredibly unlikely). vaccines tweaked natural immunity plus vaccinated immunity render new variants much much less harmful. math literally mortality rate per year likely RSV severely supressed long stretches due NPIs various degree. open schools preschool sixth grade throughout pandemic RSV still almost completely gone. dont die. Yes - could lot worse. Obviously deaths bad upward trajectory great. could see things stabilise vaccination continues kick in. ...sure shit seem like months ago Florida work. Rental cars hard come by, one fucking state east coast use EZ pass, nothing like receiving paper pick rental...a 'no fault's state. group offered tickets Disney World $120 piece...sounded cool, want deal parking, expensive food people. unbiased source numbers current COVID patients/deaths vaccinated vs unvaccinated.

I friends contracted COVID, got vaccine, contracted COVID again.

So what's point? asthmatics considered immunocompromised? Would love get third shot. So, celebrating someone volunteered time brighten lives people nursing homes, longer that? least volunteering time pick slack?

Nursing homes one grimmest places could ever end in, surrounded mostly strange faces, especially people dementia. average ""stay death"" nursing home resident little year, 13.7 months. I'll blunt, I'm pretty sure adding even little bit light people's lives far exceeds whatever benefit think gained friend longer able play piano them. take precautions viruses. fewer vaccines countries have, faster get Omega variant completely different spike RNA Alpha. higher ongoing demand vaccines US, get ordered going forward instead rerouted countries.   interpretation reading full study also linked article:

The sample size small time period state population. me, significant enough warrant 2.3x higher likelihood getting reinfected vaccinated.


What see support conclusion? ALBANY, NY (WRGB) ‚Äî Albany County Executive Dan McCoy announced daily COVID numbers county. 
 
***‚ÄúAmong Albany County‚Äôs 260 new COVID infections identified August 2 August 6, we‚Äôve found 107 individuals vaccinated 142 not.

Six vaccinated infections 10- 19-year-old age range,‚Äù said County Executive McCoy.*** 
 
This 44 positive cases diagnosed last 24 hours. also pushes 7 day average positivity 5.2% 
 
 
 
17 people hospitalized, however deaths, leaving total 388. indoor mask mandate way visible easier tool vaccine mandate, even latter effective long run.

What? many countries HUGE amount population vaccinated already, way half. easier? it, way, better, nuke social interaction remove visages indoors environments showing code people already anyway? Also, I‚Äôm willing bet vaccination rate Goldman, JP, Morgan Stanley 97% first video 99% correct. *very* minor tweak 1/3 way would make 100%, easy explain away error simplification.

The protection would higher everyone vaccinated. multiply reduction risk, due vaccine, probability encountering infected person. June/July, cases ~1/40 peak. vaccine cut infection risk (to alpha variant) 25x. means even unvaccinated person safer June/July vaccinated person December.

In words, need people vaccinated get keep cases low, reduce everyone's risk even further. factor larger reduction risk vaccine can‚Äôt force everyone change give false sense security.

\*Comment reposted swears removed appease automod. Downvote making read something Ted Cruz voice Also DeSantis: ‚ÄúPlease send us ventilators!‚Äù It‚Äôs also 1000 sets parents/caretakers make choice working taking care sick kids.

And it‚Äôs also immunocomprimised extended family members risk. think understand genetics.

I degree biology worked preclinical oncology drug discovery many years. focus de novo design optimization small-molecule kinase inhibitors molecular dynamic simulations protein-peptide interactions. One drugs worked currently market another one currently Phase 2 clinical trials. I'd say slightly better understanding genetics There's approximately 30,000 base pairs...

Going skip high school genetics lesson ones really matter amino acids active site protein attaches cells 

When protein scientist talks active site generally using term refer specifically sites enzymatic proteins substrates bind. seem talking receptor binding domain. well control protein folding.

For purposes discussion, protein folding particularly important. large difference sequence homology two spike genes (say, SARS-CoV SARS-CoV-2) overall structure spike proteins different. Certainly going see protein folding come play within Covid-19 single point mutation result change, change allows better binding, change allow less binding. protein fit like lock key, one change wrong point result protein even binding affects folding around active site available binding.

Unfortunately you, actually somewhat area expertise, spent many long hours modeling optimizing binding therapeutic peptides various target proteins. 

The lock-and-key analogy works really well small-molecule inhibitors. work well protein-protein interactions surface area protein-protein interaction massive compared small-molecule. good example T315I mutation Bcr-Abl completely abrogates binding Gleevec. look crystal structure Bcr-Abl bound Gleevec swap T315I mutation, painfully obvious Gleevec bind (the first half career spent developing drugs target T315I mutations, thats like use example). extremely rare single amino acid change produce massive change binding two proteins. Protein-protein interaction surfaces tend shallow compared binding grooves usually seen something like kinase active site. means component amino acid contributes relatively small amount delta G binding, least comes van der Waals interaction contributions. sometimes key electrostatic interactions contribute significantly delta G, even removal interactions necessarily ruin binding completely. But, detail nitty-gritty protein-protein interaction modeling little beyond scope comment. key point protein-protein interactions less lock-and-key polyamorous lovers. Also, none protein folding. Perhaps meant protein conformational changes. One reasons like reliance protein crystal structures structural studies gives people idea proteins static. much static. fluid. twist turn, loops flapping like flag breeze, amino acid side chains wiggling spinning. NMR structures good showing dynamic nature proteins. 

But anyway, I'm sure point originally trying make. sounds like threw bunch disconnected freshman biology tidbits thinking would win argument? I'm quite sure. 

More infections still means mutation increased probability deadly variant occuring.

If think true, look SARS-CoV compared SARS-CoV-2. SARS significantly fatal Covid. Yet look sequence homology spike proteins. believe somewhere around 80% homologous? That's lot room mutation still binding target. Lol def didn‚Äôt say that. said frightening. shape children‚Äôs beliefs cycle continue pandemic regular old respiratory viruses. take understand that?

The delta variant contagious respiratory virus have. also miraculously effective vaccines. aren‚Äôt equivalent.

This ‚Äúwhataboutidm‚Äù argument logical fallacy well missing point. it‚Äôs right they‚Äôre free choose.

Even accepted true, things *not* right include:

1. Going bars restaurants
2. Going stores
3. Going concerts

it sounds like impression give easy can't perfect. it‚Äôs one thing I‚Äôve learned it‚Äôs people horrible risk assessment. Especially redditors. We‚Äôre pathetic excuse country never safe, always acceptable risk. one day remove shoes get airport done years. Never found bomb.  Let preface saying fully vaccinated, definitely anti vaxxer.

I‚Äôve searched info find nothing conflicting stuff this, I‚Äôll ask here.
If someone covid, moderate-severe infection, person built immunity naturally covid?
Does vaccine people never infected? level? Less? More?
Does ‚Äòadd‚Äô persons immunity they‚Äôve infected before?

I ask family member mine moderate case months ago, pulled fine, saying don‚Äôt need vaccine would redundant.
Just looking clarity, thanks! include pregnant women Let's honest- probably hitting 1k daily deaths previous waves hmm, wonder School employees California could get vaccine starting March. felt unfair, since I‚Äôm early 30s, healthy, working home time yet able get vaccinated parents. much Taylor wanted stop, instead kept eight years marriage.

This months away earliest. really say fluke. countries low vaccination rates, variants like keep popping up. Hopefully time next one pops tho, better idea combat  accurate numbers hospitalization rate confirmed infections? feel like I've seen numbers ranging 0.5% 2%. includes comorbidities.

Do think accurate say healthy kid gets infected COVID, odds hospitalized something less 1%? Perhaps low 0.2 0.3%?

And that's accurate, know numbers (at least approximately) apply delta variant? worry, I'm sure infect soon enough. thots pears. does. law degree.

I‚Äôm trying otherwise I‚Äôll go insane. real stubborn ones resort grocery delivery.

Pretty soon able go out, get job, collect unemployment grocery shop without vaccination record.

Don't like it? Well work good community. rest us ready move on. Since refuse, happen. Sadly dead children going make difference... Remember Sandy hook? didn‚Äôt claim kids. confirm said true.  Will, Right Work.

Every state except Montana panel meets tomorrow EUA amendment would include special consideration specific circumstances. full approval boosters general population - least emergency use authorization include fully vaccinated, otherwise healthy people; Pfizer Moderna vaccines shown highly effective preventing hospitalization death CDC advisory group scheduled meet Friday, may vote whether officially recommend third shot immunocompromised people. panel‚Äôs signoff needed doctors start prescribing extra doses. seems high vaccinated people? rub capitalism lost stock prices market become ponzi scheme interest rates drive funds stock market.

These CEOs afraid happens stock price stay lockstep. There's info local subreddit, apparently rabble rousers group even kids. FWIW, county highest vaccination rate state. school board member said seen far support masks opposition. definitely crazy people, they're representative sample area.

Entire teams ended infected/quarantined work ground halt. construction site safety manager Queens said Black man, worried prospect stopped police getting Covid-19.

A graduate student Bronx gotten vaccinated said worst fears seemed confirmed vaccine government directing Black poorer neighborhoods briefly suspended small number dangerous blood clots.

And civil rights activist Bronx said grew suspicious heard last year politicians prioritizing minority neighborhoods coronavirus vaccinations.

‚ÄúSince America give anything good Black people first?‚Äù said activist, Hawk Newsome, 44-year-old Black Lives Matter leader unvaccinated.
All three situations reflect trend become major concern public health experts: Young Black New Yorkers especially reluctant get vaccinated, even Delta variant rapidly spreading among ranks. City data shows 27 percent Black New Yorkers ages 18 44 years fully vaccinated, compared 48 percent Latino residents 52 percent white residents age group.

This vaccination gap emerging latest stark racial disparity epidemic full them. Epidemiologists say expect third wave hit Black New Yorkers especially hard.

‚ÄúThis major public health failure,‚Äù said Dr. Dustin Duncan, epidemiologist Columbia University professor.

In interviews, dozens Black New Yorkers across city ‚Äî aspiring dancer Brownsville, young mother five Far Rockaway, teacher Canarsie, Black Lives Matter activist Bronx, many others ‚Äî gave long list reasons getting vaccinated, many rooted fear uncertain times could trust government health.

The fact virus hit Black neighborhoods disproportionately first wave made many extra wary getting vaccinated: feel survived worst health authorities failed help then.
But ultimately, many also said would get vaccinated forced so.

‚ÄúIf it‚Äôs going mandatory work, I‚Äôll choice,‚Äù said Kaleshia Sostre, 27-year-old Red Hook, Brooklyn, teaches parenting classes young mothers.

In Canarsie, Brooklyn, 21-year-old college student, Justin Mercado, said Mayor Bill de Blasio‚Äôs recent announcement dining restaurant would require proof vaccination got attention. likely get vaccinated.

‚ÄúI want go date sometime enjoy life much strain shuts us back down,‚Äù Mr. Mercado said.

For months, city focused vaccination campaign older residents higher risk hospitalization death.

But lately city begun reach young New Yorkers, offering $100 payments first doses, urging students get vaccinated school starts nudging employers pressure employees get vaccinated.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre done yet,‚Äù said Dr. Torian Easterling, chief equity officer New York City Health Department. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre continuing announce interventions strategies support New Yorkers getting vaccinated.‚Äù

When vaccination campaign began last year, Mr. de Blasio said intended prioritize Black Latino neighborhoods hardest hit devastating initial wave.

More third Black Hispanic New Yorkers may infected initial wave, twice infection rate white residents. people two groups died elevated rates, partly higher prevalence underlying conditions, also hospitals neighborhoods quickly overwhelmed.

Many Black New Yorkers struggled make sense community suffered first wave.

Some fears vaccine go back centuries, nation‚Äôs long history medical experimentation Black enslaved people later Black citizens. interviews, Black New Yorkers mentioned government‚Äôs decades-long Tuskegee syphilis experiment ‚Äî doctors withheld treatment Black men syphilis.

Distrust vaccine also reinforced contemporary injustices. interviews, number Black New Yorkers wondered vaccines Covid-19 could emerged quickly, one H.I.V., disproportionately affected Black Americans. Others described experiences living decrepit public housing projects criminal justice system leaving doubtful could trust government.
Some Black New Yorkers reassured see white suburbanites driving predominantly Black neighborhoods like Brownsville, Brooklyn, spring pursuit open vaccine appointments, interviews show. happened next seemed confirm fears.

One three vaccines ‚Äî single-shot Johnson &amp; Johnson ‚Äî directed Black Latino communities, among places. required one shot ‚Äî two like Moderna Pfizer vaccines ‚Äî less onerous refrigeration requirements. struck many government officials obvious choice pop-up vaccine clinics public housing projects churches central government‚Äôs plan vaccinating minority neighborhoods.

But April, federal government ordered brief suspension Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine linked blood clots brains several women.

‚ÄúIt reaffirmed hesitance, reaffirmed everything,‚Äù Ms. Shavuo-Goodwin, graduate student clinic manager, said. ‚ÄúIt shows Black lives don‚Äôt matter. test us like tested syphilis us.‚Äù

This fear echoed interview interview, Bronx South Brooklyn, many Black New Yorkers said Johnson &amp; Johnson suspension left anxious vaccines unsafe, insufficiently tested steered Black neighborhoods. fear slow dissipate, even much rest country got vaccinated.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre experimenting us,‚Äù said Knya White, 21, Canarsie, Brooklyn, predominantly Black neighborhood.
After short pause, C.D.C. deemed Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine safe use.

Because vaccine rolled age cohorts, many young adults confronting question whether become vaccinated individual choice, rather decision made families.

Yikes. calm dude. Yes, get infected. point ‚Äúif‚Äù likely since Delta took over. That‚Äôs point. Obviously it‚Äôs still less likely you‚Äôre unvaccinated, everyone knows that.

I‚Äôm equating vaccinated unvaccinated either. Vaccination protects us 90%+ serious problems, yet doesn‚Äôt well initially hoped breakthrough infections transmission. mean that‚Äôs sort given point, I‚Äôm sure seems controversial you. Delta way transmissible, it‚Äôs fact sadly.

Yes, I‚Äôm fully vaccinated. RKI's [FAQ says get vaccine starting four weeks symptoms disappear, condition future variants anything like that.  Link? I'm sure occurs, likely far lower rate symptomatic people.

The broader point though, virus never going away endemic point stay way. best get many people vaccinated possible follow data boosters required (I'm mind they're required yet probably eventually).  Aiming Zero Covid realistic option. WV college mentioned article also requiring weekly testing unvaccinated students: 
""Unvaccinated students wear mask social distance campus. also required undergo weekly testing. School officials said fee help cover costs testing."" anyone remember website could put county, size group, type activity, would give approximate risk someone room covid? Well put. Considering roughly 37 million confirmed cases US far, I'd guess number Americans long term issues millions. Covid might become leading cause death decades come. Well USA whole defense production act going blocking exports materials needed vaccine producing countries. Real class act also means parents work care kids. hit productivity end corporate earnings. 

Even look purely capitalist terms, OK. you‚Äôre vaccinated don‚Äôt serous health issues, chances getting seriously sick covid minuscule.

Life especially travel always always risk disease. to, vaccines end goal, I‚Äôve mine. There‚Äôs lot point alive aren‚Äôt living. Someone please correct Im wrong clicked link study data think conclusion they‚Äôre making strong. 

As far tell there‚Äôs comparison group. looked ton students masking little covid spread. But, didn‚Äôt assess whether schools without masks higher covid rates removing confounding variables.

Everywhere forgot two week period. like slipped everyone's mind. Asymptomatic transmission occur according Singaporean studies (these studies post delta). Israel also testing everyone prior this- numbers remarkably accurate throughout pandemic. don‚Äôt understand point. Yes, certainly. ""Finish him,"" that's good one. There's what, 5-6 billion people world unvaccinated yet? 

Statistically, new variant coming outside US anyways. 

Here's annual boosters No, mean Israeli data could right start never point. point Israeli data were, are, rubbish collected rubbish methodology; might accurate not, give fuck that, agenda.

Again, highly suggest read others write, otherwise attitude come across dumb instead brilliantly sarcastic. reason enough vaccine coverage reduce transmission. 

No, reason multiple leaks manage get ahead time. record, Vietnam Cambodia seem past peak. Additionally, much data transmission among got idea ""every country world control theory""?

Because true. Mass testing, strict border policies locking cities rocket science. Literally everyone do. question always: without completely wrecking economy society? alternatives worse? many experts right China arguing answer might longer yes, given costly strategy showing Delta. Obviously would far costlier countries far higher level transmission.   numbers close winter surge

Israel also testing everyone, they're picking asymptomatic cases countries aren't. think positive PCR test asymptomatic vaccinated individual something concerned about. place people ask what's Covid. AFAIK, country's (Germany) guideline says ""wait 6 months infection, future variant escapes natural immunity, maybe could ask vaccine 28 days symptoms disappear"". Entirely predictable. Lets say none die. Lets also say one lasting symptoms, make full recovery. still thousand sick children - many miserable, uncomfortable, missing sleep coughing likely pain. enough changed policy try prevent this?

Similar tone above, go CVS, Walgreens, etc. non-active hours, might give pass vaccine child?

Basically find legal means get vaccine. Shady people trusted. think might work legal areas willing break law one rule. like lot young people getting vaccinated gave us green light vaccine producing nation us exported pitiful amount compared others.

And one vaccine export policy majority 2021. retrospect, I'm actually \*against\* vaccine, gotten yet. reasoning enough information feel comfortable getting choosing get from.

As article points out, vaccines different results vary greatly. I'd like make right choice get vaccine, eventually will. likely get within time frame think people would happy (being ""now"" long wait).

Beyond would knowledge process [vaccines normally [how developed be. That's fault, know I'll still questions even get done reading articles linked.

People get vaccine feel comfortable it, wish bombarded news [the got there, less much ""just get it.""  company supposed pay COVID tests? government? Yes, AZ seems effective long run. compare swine flu outbreak decade ago fatality rate calculated 0.03% worst flu pandemic 50 years.

So even high vaccination rate covid still far lethal outbreak since Spanish flu 100 years ago.

The US deaths Spanish Flu put 500,000-850,000

US covid deaths far - 633,000

A lot countries massively undercounting covid deaths. India officially published excess death figures since 2019 400,000 figure simply credible. Multiple researchers putting fatalities somewhere 3.4 million 4.9 million.

The estimates Americas Europe accounting half two thirds China still pretending virus exist even nothing them.

Globally likely somewhere 10 15 million dead far. Surface transmission‚Ä¶ isn‚Äôt really thing all. you‚Äôre vaccinated healthy, there‚Äôs lot reason avoid travel it‚Äôs want.

I travel heavily work started flying last September. We‚Äôve vaccinated since March, reservations. I‚Äôve taken probably 100 covid tests last year. Even there‚Äôs ton testing travel, feel perfectly safe. Diet modest effect cholesterol levels, unless eating fast food time, course. go talk cardiologist ask needs echocardiogram maybe Holter monitor. also ask doctor needs statins cholesterol levels drop.  helps sure, enough itself. One worst outbreaks entire pandemic happening Fiji right now, even smaller isolated island nation NZ. French Polynesia Hawaii also major outbreaks. New Zealand's authorities done well far keep covid out, sanctimonious posturing recent months smug now. Acting like rest world followed simple steps covid would gone fantasy thinking totally constructive.

My family country, making increasingly angry seems willingness engage reality pursuing ""zero covid"" indefinitely absolute mugs game. means border closures long term, threat sudden lockdowns long term.

Even coming ""low risk"" country, setting parameters suddenly considered ""medium risk"" ""high risk"". hell ever going able plan visit back NZ UK could suddenly change booking (expensive) tickets getting plane?

I‚Äôm terrified going back school. teach elementary sheer thought 30 kids room optional masks scares me. going outbreaks first week. first day. I‚Äôm hoping schools go back remote get vaccinated. Til! Arkansas tossed 5,700 doses due expiration. covid surge increased demand vaccination. 80,000 doses expected thrown used. I'd like see data study itself. I'm pretty skeptical. upside data confirmed another weapon fight COVID cheap widely available.

Unfortunately, well additional studies underway become fodder kooks anti-faxxers push disinformation MAQA zeitgeist. first wave came unexpectedly, virus new. testing absolute crap time, really even sure big Northeast. Doctors way better options treating Covid now, hospitals actually deal patients beginning pandemic. 

I'd rather see hospital collapse looks like person, I'm pretty sure either. probably varying degrees stages it. Remember New York beginning? Ambulances taking cardiac patients revived spot. Seems like partial collapse me. 

My definition many preventable deaths go unprevented hospitals overwhelmed patients. would mean anyone need emergency care absolutely boned. 

We already seeing preventative appointments elective surgeries cancelled. seems like least beginnings collapse, ""elective"" surgeries indeed save lives. FYI, immunocompromised people get vaccinated! vaccine work well since harder time making antibodies, recommended get third dose booster shot. Pretty much people can't get allergic, tiny percentage adult population. agree sort exemption them, time, would hope sakes they'd worried effects virus willingly expose Delta variant. minimum wage restaurant worker, stare bunch bikers insisting get in? issue bothers even vaccine available today, takes month reach full immunity.  aren‚Äôt enough breakthrough cases get decent CI. guess that‚Äôs good problem have. way limit spread. only.

Want know still mess? people go COVID complications STILL realize need tell people get vaccinated. Wouldn‚Äôt cloth masks still effective everyone wearing mask? thought cloth masks least effective preventing delta everyone else unmasked. hold adults responsible functioning brain.  Shocking right South Dakota, would they? data fine, it‚Äôs CDC able report 0.001% breakthrough cases 160 million vaccinated Americans. call us, use WebMD.

Google also shows search vaccination. Looks like actually 30% first dose. Lol, must real it‚Äôs Internet there‚Äôs way could flu point see anyone getting vaccine choice dying addition subtraction. Happy. Cant parents charged anything? mean know people died covid. Sending somebody infected infect others seems like punishable offense. See point 2, above.

""How many children take part study?
There approximately 4644 healthy children overall study. 


Approximately 48 children age group child taking part Phase 1 study 4 different sites. 


This consent Phase 2/3 approximately 4500 children taking part phase. Phase 2/3 study conducted approximately 100 different study sites. ""


And placebo:

Study Vaccines

Once study doctor confirmed child meets study requirements, child randomly assigned (like drawing straws) receive study vaccine placebo. every 2 participants receive investigational COVID-19 vaccine, 1 participant receive placebo. one (including you, child, child‚Äôs personal doctor study team) choose assignment. placebo looks like study vaccine, contain study vaccine‚Äôs active ingredient(s). 



This phase study ‚Äòplacebo-controlled observer-blinded phase‚Äô means you, child study doctor know whether child receiving investigational COVID-19 vaccine placebo. person gives child injection know investigational COVID-19 vaccine placebo look same. syringe covered label contents visible person gives child injection able talk it. case urgent need, study doctor learn quickly whether child received study vaccine placebo hasn‚Äôt even two weeks. Sure. point could better masking combined measures. Unfortunately lot schools really fuck praying works out. Funny bring PhDs since, according university Pittsburgh, that's group vaccine hesitant. Also, people shedding virus despite vaccinated? initial spikes happened populations higher vaccination rates. mean everything I'm saying fact check want buy social media scares. Also, people promoting healthy lifestyle since 78% icu patients obese Since SF, would assume people started wearing masks. It‚Äôs difficult. Masks work protect innocent kids. Sending ""thoughts dont cares""... admitted sick, want vaccine. Unfortunately antibodies given early infection. Bring lawsuits. Every penny spent parents keep kids home school = damages. Bankrupt asshole.  There's reasoning anyway Loser award arrested. Try reading post again.

They said test children because, child's illness visually apparent, pretend otherwise long confirm students' illness test. Interesting, someone who's never there, idea parts Florida high density.

Yes, hold great serious illness death. change super spreader award. take probably different rest.

 American doctors trigger-happy young kids kind respiratory problems particular. several reasons this, but, rule thumb, young child kind diagnosable respiratory issues would go ventilator much sooner comparable adult does. Canada, children 4 under, sorts respiratory problems #1 reason overnight hospital stay. Hell, first kid spent first day life ventilator, doctors worried fluid lungs.

Ignoring rest.

Less week later I‚Äôm almost good new. Look data places like Israel plus help idea: 

You math Delta varient based percentage population time. Data Israel shows decrease efficacy comes cases symptoms vaccine administered.

Of course, issues data. know based decent amount breakthrough infections occuring transmission vaccinated people happening. implications comes protecting people vaccinated getting weaker immune response vaccines.

The vaccines, especially time great preventing literal infection, helps fight system (rather provide sterilizing immunity). still great people contagious less time (even viral load similar start), get sick, even so, less likely die.

But immunity equal across population. People older otherwise immunocompromised less average varying degrees depending situation.

The CDC stopped tracking breakthrough cases months ago using obviously faulty data public messaging actually undermine message whole.

It's mess.  anyone idea age window 12 approval? 0-12 another increment like 6-12 approved?  wish NFL would required full vaccination fans attending stadiums. would bold statement, would increased vaccination rates somewhat. no, pussyfooting around it.

I normally go two Packer games every year. I've taking daughter pre-season game past years, loves (for quarter). Definitely year. looked policy Lambeau, I'm comfortable it. Nothing vaccination, masks recommended. care outdoor venue, that's still lot people packed tightly. I'll happily enjoy games comfort couch, we'll see next year brings. would say waaay effective, even perfect seal; perfect give way protection.

I fairly thick beard (which complete using N95 medical settings), follow protocol N95 difference N95 / KN95 cloth / surgical mask like day night. example, smells non-existent / extremely muted N95 (and way smaller particles aerosol) surgical one makes difference. ~~other~~ news, Trump rally two weeks.   Good riddance. Good luck getting pacemaker right now, too. I'm Texas canceling (and many heart procedures) hospital beds go surgery. 100% vaccination NEVER happen. Getting every single human planet agree something incredibly unlikely may well nonexistent. love reasonable takes like get downvoted oblivion hive mind. make clear seems lot confusion? ‚ÄúAt risk‚Äù mean less protected vaccine. YES, potentially higher risk severe covid GET covid, immune system functions NORMALLY vaccine received given protection everyone else normal immune system. 

Vaccines work leveraging immune system‚Äôs response virus. someone weak immune system, standard 2-shot vaccine substantially less effective someone healthy, normal functioning immune system. need additional doses vaccine get level protection everyone else. 

Someone suppressed immune system limited natural defenses catching covid (or virus matter). catch virus, can‚Äôt rely immune system help combat it- meaning get hit harder illness lasts longer, worse symptoms, immune system help recover, ends putting lot immunosuppressed people hospitals fighting life. 

I hope post helps people better understand it‚Äôs important immunocompromised get priority booster shots ‚Äúat-risk,‚Äù getting booster shot vaccines still effective won‚Äôt substantial benefits you. 

As someone immunocompromised, it‚Äôs frustrating keep reading comments non- immunosuppressed people prioritizing panicking vaccines booster shots, knowing people actually functioning immune systems help protect them. nothing vaccine help us. That‚Äôs actually amazing large event. Mad respect organizers.
Seems like fully vaccinated PCR test way go. many European countries rapid antigen tests used experience always good. California get digital verification. Tuskegee Syphilis Study one generation ago, people memory.

I usually don‚Äôt comment stuff, it‚Äôs important people know vaccines work. Yes, delta made things worse. parents vaccinated much less likely infect children less likely get infected first place.

Glad dodged it.. even knows prevalent antivax nonsense growing. Yes test kids weekly too. thorough contact tracing. Masks indoors out. Social distancing whenever possible. kids need sip water leave classroom lower mask drink. Literally anything going exact figure. Data always aggregated show patterns make best guess decisions. 

I'm sorry really think U.S case numbers *aren't* also 'estimate'?  think. dismissal adds conflict groups get vaccinated

If care enough grandparents elderly, sure hell care them. Delta far harmful kids. We're going start seeing dead kids :( Travis County.

Glad she‚Äôs recovery. someone immuno-suppressing medications, I‚Äôve reading studies pretty heavily. read, believe immunocompromised (usually transplant/cancer patients studied highest level immunocompromised) show 3rd shot brings protection close someone healthy received 2 vaccine dose. It‚Äôs still bit gray-area though, everyone‚Äôs immune systems respond differently. addition antibody levels (which studies seen focus on) guaranteed measure immunity. [John Hopkins article got first dose December second late January pretty please get one soon Catholic priests area suggesting vaccine... deep south. YMMV. theres also growing cases children hospitalized needing ICU. shits getting real scary wife's employee refused offer time cash bonus get vaccinated.  actually afraid microchips.  

She also said employer said get one, would lie claim religious exemption.  Anecdotal take grain salt.

My teenage daughter covid twice ( likes live dangerously sandwiched getting hit car walking crosswalk school last year two covid infections ). Ugg, dad stinks years.

Anyway, quarantined covid house twice basically made stay room much possible door closed, wore mask anytime actively around her, kept windows open much possible ( easier summer last Feb ), cleaned bathroom daily ( next door room least traveling infringe common areas house though son's bedroom shares hall ) basically tried keep cooties away rest house. first infection prior vaccination masks isolation tool box, last time rest house vaccinated pretty much kept routines.

All long block text means I'd isolate areas use much humanly possible. go areas use mask practice good hand hygiene fact. Maybe source food bit. Things like that. vaccine keep safe keep reassurance back mind. last infection daughter catch quickly days everyone else house relying vaccines protection held up.

Good luck hope parents get quickly safely.   Haha saw primary care doc week ago. told gotten third dose recently told look getting one feel comfortable since work high risk setting. First fauci create HIV god magically get rid it. spent large part career researching hiv Would consider Native Americans collective culture? infected disease individualism? not, think probably plays large role people getting vaccine protect community. idea totally absent US. opt-in.  say they're going test kids week. fucking guy... give another perspective it, see wouldn‚Äôt want kids virtual school. met young child? ones know would able focus stay task online classes. 

As comment said, sucks kids can‚Äôt normal school year, don‚Äôt deserve face problems created people old enough actually take responsibility.  That‚Äôs even lot cases. Many parents US paid sick leave. literally can‚Äôt afford take day work. (I know isn‚Äôt case article, theoretical, there‚Äôs complicated problems parents wanting deal with/protect kids.) confers lot better immunity likely asymptomatic. Symptomatic reinfection
Just isn‚Äôt happening large scale. numbers would keep going never down.  anti-vaxx conservatives keep hearing about. are, I'm vaccinated everyone around child I'm still bit nervous sure guarantee get one us. would much nervous around unvaccinated people lived area low vaccination rates. 

I disagree article title, think news outlets struggle messaging around covid. science complex, there's lot statistical analysis behind numbers thrown around regulatory landscape complicated consistent country country. Distilling sound bites results really crappy communication! Florida: hold endotracheal tube know hard get mind crazy, can't understand willing take hydroxychloroquine vaccine. already willing put chemicals developed scientists body, put something proven work? place updates regularly regards vaccination numbers US?

It'd nice see numbers change get vaccine mandates like California. protect &amp; serve... capital owners, communities they'll interacting every day. No, they're saying going test every kid, every week. many us would happily get 12 kids vaccinated today approved EUA. desire parents wait full authorization prevent others getting vaccinated. FDA failing horribly here.

Yes, yes, yes. Give us EUA let want wait full approval wait.  America‚Äôs obesity problem refuse acknowledge huge problem entire pandemic Supposedly, every kid get tested week. We'll see actually plays out. Even ‚Äúnon-inflated‚Äù numbers awful. Stop semantic open eyes. Florida TX currently Covid cesspools. Subtracting couple thousand cases doesn‚Äôt change know it. literally go county health dashboards view numbers ‚Äúvaccine status‚Äù, live CA may well florida/Texas far politics concerned currently total post vaccine cases=181 whereas total unvaccinated cases=22,207 fantasy Kids too. sorry, sick leave....some people hours burn There's logical argument. that, agree.  extend patients eligible vaccine well + long there's still massive unvaccinated population US, vaccinated greater risk mutation evades vaccines. world large also impacts this. 

However, hopefully would mean weeks renewed extra caution updated vaccine created distributed. one people caring health people deserve kids. pregnant vaxed? so, may passed antibodies baby. maddening time us parents 12 right now. vaccine close yet seems far away kids hope everyone around help keep safe. live Alabama so....  So, kid 11 size 13 year old, would prefer get 30 micrograms older kid younger kid. I‚Äôm thinking loud guess wonder means wait til 12 birthday regardless approval get effective dose. Idk all. mess. Congratulations tribal leaders hard work make possible. well done.

I'm trying compare/contrast current situation historic cold/flu seasons feels like similar situation point vastly different measures taken.

Yes - although Delta protection decreased previous variants  Yeah Mr. White, science! guy gets Wow. reason stopping mitigation measures? done, takes work. New York Times several video visits NYC hospitals spring 2020, first surge.

These whiny bitches running doctor made decision get immunization.

Anyone made conscious decision get shot, citing anything valid medical reasons, tough home get it. Definitely interesting article. early January, chance weaknesses mentioned addressed since then? Probably sadly...

What US *does* legitimately going much higher vaccination mentioned. still *much* lower be, many states anyways. still *much* higher India peak crisis. public health officials remind us again, despite reduced effectiveness Delta, still highly effective reducing risk severe illness death.

I'm intending defend governors Florida, Texas, states dealing situation. conduct ridiculous, absurd, morally repugnant. I'm Canadian, I'm spoiled live country one best vaccination rates world, leadership that's mostly reasonable handling pandemic. genuinely understand this. party one less government interference/control, he's exercising government control get way. really get it.  wonder guy high fiving kids photo daily.

Well....good them! Glad major school districts Texas good sense defy Governor Abbott require masks. requiring providing Covid-19 vaccinations, though? ‚Ä¶wouldn‚Äôt breathing nose even mouth they‚Äôre chewing circumvent this?

Piece fucking shit. Sorry. PIECE SHIT Rights without responsibility realm teenagers. No, don‚Äôt understand whole annoying thing.

Ok. Explore black Twitter bit, saying background see he‚Äôs read ‚ÄúThe Last Lion‚Äù, autobiographical tome Churchill.  

He‚Äôs smart man. they're stupid take vaccine save lives, what's point sympathy? refusing vaccine protect others deadly virus something happened years ago stupid. vaccines weren‚Äôt granted emergency use, they‚Äôd still unavailable since still don‚Äôt FDA approval. imagine last eight months without vaccines? gives damn minority population hesitant cites ‚Äúrushing‚Äù reason? Risk wise, 30 minutes &lt; 8 hours. Official propaganda like reduces credibility substantially think. Everyone vaccinating putting young lives risk. Thank much, understand stats data, stuff (research studies conflicting findings) confusing making anxious, worrying people life vaccinated suddenly thinking they're protected all. wearing masks shouldn‚Äôt problem, right? taking reasonable precautions deadly pandemic cuz kids find nasal swab uncomfortable, got it.  tests Washington usually swab front area nose, kind scrub brain. Check see testing centers same. really easy kids practice Qtip home going kids comfortable. daughter even nose non-invasive. want pay childcare sick kid miss work? selfish you! /s purifier buy? thinking thing. Thank you. wonder also get covid bad it'd guess reports seem suggest prevent hospitalizations pretty strongly least.  spreading misinformation painfully easy get correct info. [Source incubation period COVID-19 thought extend 14 days, median time 4-5 days exposure symptoms median time onset illness time experienced dyspnea 5‚Äì8 days; median time onset illness acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) 8‚Äì12 days; median time onset illness ICU admission 9.5‚Äì12 days.

And even take account people get sick lala indirectly attendees.  work pharmacy 30-40% (numbers pulled ass) people coming COVID vaccine wearing mask. even comparable. Northeast Novel virus hit Northeast first, everyone parts Country downplayed it. 

For South refused vaccine take precautions despite knowing ramifications. fuck school reopening beginning August? long ago. would change plans you. Society medical science antidotes evolution. 

As group take care many many many individuals would died long ago own. Dear god, that‚Äôs one ugly creature yes, still personally responsible helping spread covid, malicious reasons like many antivaxxers. Funny, remember compassionate outreach vehicle helped us defeat smallpox, measles, polio. Clear-eyed insistence people right thing, via mandates, got us periods. option exists ought exercised, misguided attempts meet fools fools flourish doomed start...and would doom us all.  Thank providing blatant example I've seen today person arguing bad faith.

You've opened straw man (your imagined folk pretend immortal), went straight slippery slopes (no car rides, restaurants), finished conflation (that availability vaccine = utilization).

But hey, least insulting people share 'insights' conclusions. it.  damn shit blows! Vaccinated here, posting sitting waiting results rapid test. Family visit week east coast, unvaccinated family member created outbreak including breakthrough immuno compromised family member..... lost much basic respect for.people this. single unvaccintaed family member sound reason asked ...... stupid mother expose kid's classmates Covid-19. That's disgusting. Here's hoping mothers kid's classmates get together sue woman's ass off! would serve mother Covid-19 infected kid exactly right! Wait, Sturgis week? Ah heck. Ding ding ding   Facebook also adjusting salaries work outside office's primary city location (i.e. moved another state region).

e.g. work Facebook HQ Menlo Park, CA salary $120k, move work Las Vegas, NV (but plan return someday), salary significantly less CA.

Source: (it says Google article, Facebook &amp; Twitter following them) Yes! mexico also working nasal vaccine? Yeah, that's thought. approve (if goes well) placebo group offered vaccine, right? Even it‚Äôs true there‚Äôs going many parents won‚Äôt know that‚Äôs option. vaccine needs actual authorization 12s. looks like Peter Griffin rushed KA would happening simply stopped testing.  remember people pretend ""pro-life

Because pretend care *sooo* much kids gives political power electoral victories new peak 239 week ending August 9. number 184 children reported previous week

That's increase, overall seems fairly low. see overall trends  Good message, terrible framing. nurse giving saline solution shots yesterday reason people getting vaccine past 8 months? Time travelers! much harm risk reduction possible. black white poor faith continue act like one hear ""mark beast"" driven religious reasons hesitancy. know overcome must order get pandemic. Fort bend really good handling covid comparison surrounding Houston counties. top charts vaccination rates right seem one lower infection rates (but still high overall) Houston metro area. say, Arizona months back, Navajo aren‚Äôt playing around! Everyone wore mask, would tell mask, signs saying ‚Äúkeep everyone safe stay away, stay home‚Äù posted front peoples driveway. Antelope canyon shut down, land. Everyone seemed board really impressed. Unlike people backward ass state (La). that's pretty close MIB quote, equally true barely punishing people tried start coup government -- think local, like-minded people going strict enforcement? policy effective. Evidence suggests outdoor activities close zero risk spreading COVID-19.

The goal maximize vaccinations, minimize illness death due COVID-19, accomplished minimizing spread COVID-19. Vaccines great tool that, they're one. could stop indoor gatherings make everything happen outside, quite possibly need vaccines all. Obviously, that's possible. casino That's everyone whose bodies take vaccine get vaccinated. way help protect people can't get vaccine immune disorders, whose body respond vaccine could get many shots want still protected it. quite selfish decide get vaccine die illness get infected. think people passing virus to, whose body respond vaccine serious reaction virus. part stop spread, save many lives. hard. long year.  amazon.com e-commerce website allowed posts comments.

Mask pushed harder vaccinated people vaccines unvaccinated people. believe entirely mask visual indicator much one cares pandemic vaccines invisible, despite mask less impactful vaccines stoping Covid it‚Äôs effects. profs know got rid attendance-based grading last year. profs still this, might take Dean Students, college Dean. Wait, thought said didn‚Äôt want medical state whatever. wth this? You‚Äôd think she‚Äôd snap losing stephhmonther.  I‚Äôm asking percentage daily ‚Äúreported cases‚Äù vaccinated vs unvaccinated. Surely subgroup ‚Äúreported cases‚Äù know vaccination status? still gas masks every house everyone? So, flipped around... 80% Delta infections among unvaccinated, 95% Delta deaths among unvaccinated? 

While **as** good original strain, I'd say that's still pretty damn amazing vaccines still much way get younger kids approved somehow convince vaccine holdouts get shot. 

If think vaccines way this, think it? feel we're rehashing study 3rd time (at least) sub last days. good discussion /r/COVID19. Also asked Scott Gottlieb Yawn. USA always bad. Got it. Well, problem Alberta, Mississipi/Alabama hybrid Canada. seem like one side totally pro therapeutics rejects vaccines? trip planned two weeks, im interested details well share &amp; Natives: 95%

Wow

And makes ongoing wave anti-Asian racism even infuriating. feels like Asian community generally diligent came quarantining, masking up, getting vaccinated, yet racists still blame COVID I‚Äôm sure reasonable, heard ‚Äúif sniffles that‚Äôs excuse miss class‚Äù one occasion university back day. tool there? don‚Äôt say masking social distancing viable long term solution I‚Äôm asking percentage daily reported new infections vaccinated people.

Oh, would amazing. hope true. 5th 2nd grader start school next week. state good test scores idiot doctor Yes. look per capita, you‚Äôre 400% better (at least last time compared). 

Washington Post pretty good comparison, tracking per 100,000 residents.

Hope answers question. I've seen IQ test looks like two year old. Basically, potty trained stack blocks. Well damn really sucks bud lol. fuckin love breakfast. Bet she'll instead losing job. I‚Äôve described Abbott DeSantis (yeah, I‚Äôm lucky enough live Florida) sociopaths now. way anyone conscience could issue orders they‚Äôve issued knowing people, including children, die it. 

My daughter returned school Tuesday (thankfully she‚Äôs old enough fully vaccinated) Wednesday two teachers already COVID. kicker, peep school, district health department. found one positive posted personal web page, grapevine.

But, example, per OP article, 25k new covid cases reported Florida yesterday. Surely amongst reported cases know percentage vaccinated unvaccinated? Yeah, too. Feel strange sense pride DOC might save day, yet time becoming *a lot* harder get, presumably newest fad. Muttering breath wish everyone go back *safe, proven* hydroxychloroquine... Also many orders magnitude new hosts virus continue mutating think weeks?

If every adult got vaccinated absolutely would make difference. immediately weeks.  16+ 12-15 year olds ""at risk"" live someone claimed Mississippi‚Äôs total number hospitalizations ‚Äúremain peak August 2020.‚Äù false. August 2020, COVID-related hospitalizations **peaked 978**. Tuesday, number **1,378.** 
 
Reeves also claimed Mississippi‚Äôs total number patients ICU beds remains ‚Äúat near peak levels August 2020.‚Äù also false. August, number COVID patients ICU beds peaked 337. Tuesday, number 388.

*Dude‚Ä¶ helping* Butasonide, that's probably something prescribed millions would probably need doctor control (I think) 

I know new drug easier prescribe got Pfizer shot gotten j&amp;j went CVS acted like I‚Äôd never vaccinated before. Protocol may vary store store, state state. Health risks aside, think worst case scenario would you‚Äôre turned away. district (central IL) offer online schooling. already started (year round school). avoiding watching news clue going work COVID unit went 1 positive fully opening 50 bed unit filling Rule Outs Positives. 

Peds us already full due RSV outbreak so... yeah fun. acting rationally, would argue many see benefits vaccines greater good view push mass vaccination attack individual autonomy (even, point, vaccines help receive them!) God bless you. hospital systems remain close failure indefinitely? first wave, kept hearing every hospital system close collapsing, ever actually happen? I‚Äôm isolating kid anymore entire household vaccinated him. Prior high risk people household didn‚Äôt seem right risk lives. summer he‚Äôs taken fencing, done number day camps, he‚Äôs going back school. entire point. can‚Äôt stay home longer neither us okay does, going back school. fact go back school without access vaccine without around required mask sucks though. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è matter.

‚Å†‚Å†

The couple, married 34 years lifelong residents Greenwood-Fort Smith area, didn‚Äôt like idea getting vaccine, children said. became sick attending high school reunion died within three days late July.‚Å† deaths caused rift within family, whose children remain split views vaccine.‚Å†‚Å†
‚Å†‚Å†

Parish said simply doesn‚Äôt trust newly created vaccine doesn‚Äôt regret parents didn‚Äôt get it, saying choice. felt judgment friends acquaintances asking parents weren‚Äôt vaccinated‚Äîwhy didn‚Äôt make them.‚Å†‚Å†
‚Å†‚Å†

‚ÄúNo one try make feel guilty someone died,‚Äù Parish said.‚Å†‚Å†
‚Å†‚Å†

Her brother opposite reaction. tried unsuccessfully push parents get vaccinated trying persuade relatives. put friends acquaintances‚Äô conspiracy theories vaccine, even parents‚Äô deaths.‚Å†‚Å†
‚Å†‚Å†

Arkansas‚Äô Sebastian County, includes Greenwood Fort Smith, less 36% residents 12 older fully immunized first week August, compared 42% Arkansas overall 50% U.S. overall. ‚Å†‚Å†
‚Å†‚Å†

Community leaders trying everything persuade reluctant populace take them. Delta variant spreading, today‚Äôs Covid-19 isn‚Äôt Covid-19 last year, Lee Johnson, local doctor Republican state lawmaker, said Greenwood City Council meeting. ‚Å†‚Å†
‚Å†‚Å†

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs never looked like this,‚Äù said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre full. hospital full. ER full.‚Äú‚Å†‚Å† fairly different example, solution also comparable. 

If keep kids teachers home, therefore reducing immensely quality education provided well numerous social benefits school community provides child fear school shootings- would comparable. 

But done right? Kids still went school. Schools implementing measures protect case it, reduce chances shootings happening (not saying agree here). 

Maybe misunderstood intention behind comment, seems saying keep schools closed? capitalisms. end game capitalism. child labor laws exist reason. feel like people know Regeneron's monoclonal antibody treatment uses stem cells similar ways MRNA vaccines. remain ethically consistent. possibly might less too. body antibodies floating around months months. adding third won‚Äôt require body produce many antibodies time around. 

The first like ‚Äú hey heads up. There‚Äôs new thing injected body. wanted let know get prepared‚Äù. body begins recognize something alien introduced starts get primed.

Sure, absolutely free choose take vaccine. everything else, choices upsides consequences. seems almost hospitalizations deaths lately unvaccinated people. FFS- Trump got vaccine.

The talking heads don‚Äôt know people STUDY LIVING. 

Otherwise mean wait hospital bed like everyone else. May odds favor. Yeah I'm agreeing you. There's reason ""push"" FDA right texas needs teachers teachers need texas

Is really true? thought Texas wanted babysitters, care whether teaching actually going not. landlords raise rent tenants stacking 10% month -- starting 50% -- tenant adequately able convince landlord they're vaccinated.

Let's show landlords love -- they've suffered enough pandemic we'll get pwn anti-vaxxers, too. California's data actually shows this. 10-15 percent hospitalizations vaccinated people. remember correctly, lower end danger levels.

That said, took account people Cali vax, 85-90 percent hospital vaxxed... really showed effective vax are.

But yeah, vaccine never touted give 100% immunity. flu vax like 60% range... 

Ok side note, friend mine got covid two pfizer. can't smell taste.

95% young people 12-17 years old San Francisco vaccinated.

Generally speaking, Europe masked children entire pandemic, kind uniquely american obsession (maybe asia also). they‚Äôve emboldened violence esp last years Staying outside might better advice. wishful thinking rich countries US first vaccinate population first. anything world, rich countries get first developing countries get sometimes later ever. 

With Covid vaccine, seeing world population easy access vaccine years come. unfortunate truth world works. what‚Äôs problem Covid vaccines then? It‚Äôs given millions proven safe effective. Full FDA approval expected start Pfizer vaccine next month two. Never mind 40 years research mRNA get point viable use vaccines roughly 20 years research SARS -CoV able use pivot towards vaccine SARS-CoV-2 now, quite bad guy made out. However, note past weeks forecasting trend line routinely pushed worst-case scenario. think also take account actual cases (only confirmed cases--Florida 25% test positivity rate right now) take account several states completely ICU beds, cause many deaths (which may counted toward covid something else).

Even so, likely trend line shows 1,000 deaths/day within next 4 weeks. However, worst-case (which honestly likely appears) forecast shows 1k/day within next 3 weeks 2k/day within 4 weeks. Thank you! Proudly vaccinated already ZERO issue getting booster! Good. ie. feelings care facts  wanna mention preprint article back March proceed caution drawing conclusions. Pretty fascinating exciting application cannabis though true. I've waiting peer review analysis since first came anyone seen follow things issued, please post! worried, I‚Äôve read it‚Äôs contagious enough outrun delta (which also dangerous). study showed evaded vaccine misleading since:
1. title one claiming evaded vaccine article said simply little resistant still effective. 
2. performed several tests got result matter time completely expected hence doesn‚Äôt mirror would happen real world. 

A lot scientists said current vaccines still effective it.  I'm tired fucking stories. Florida brags ""Protected Vulnerable"" *inbreeding  Kids Georgia always started August. get done late May early June that. sure that‚Äôs precedent. Maybe farming heat related? may onto something there. people go around juvenile attitude dishing labels everything everyone.  did, actually. sucks. interestingly theory triggered virus, covid vaccine anytime I'm exposed ill way, comes back.  called biased.
They using logic, emotions use anything fits agenda argument without ever considering side things. Ohhh Yeah, no, vax supporter üôÇ  happen link projections? 

Not trolling, genuinely curious. 

Since hospitalizations largely younger ones winter surge, expecting mortality rates much lower. Unless course, we‚Äôre talking sheer volume infections Delta. inevitable. I'm immunocompromised, fully prepared take booster shot sometime next year announce we'll need one. I'll first line happens too. macro collecting like soul stones floating around earlier year

Will update find it. Hold pls.  Hi all‚Äîlike many, I‚Äôm parent young children, one extremely looking forward starting preschool month. It‚Äôs small class, state &amp; county (but rising like everywhere) cases. Everyone wears masks except snack time.

Everything I‚Äôve seen virus makes doubtful we‚Äôll place cases begin decrease winter. guess I‚Äôm asking: think/project coming months US? general curve new cases last year? possibly short spike decrease? (I‚Äôm encouraged UK trends, actually lockdowns there, doesn‚Äôt seem comparable.)

Thanks sorry long question.  places requesting proof vaccination (like restaurants, bars, etc) need doses 1 enough you‚Äôre waiting second one? Stay inside wear mask sense mandated disclosures personal information safety establishment individual. heckled, threats implied. can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm seeing Americans behave like this.  Unvaccinated people go back line. vaccinated person another health emergency ‚Äî keep hospital bed. It‚Äôs fair. Leaving politics moment, blame laid feet CDC, Fauci Brix start pandemic told people masks dangerous CDC panic mode trying buy masks could find want compete public them.

If delivered consistent, honest message start instead lying people would far willing trust them.

You can't tell people ""masks kill you"" one week change ""mask mandatory"" next expect people trust you.  Seek therapy, severely mentally ill thought process. believe child risk dying going school (he‚Äôs not)‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs risk you‚Äôre willing take because‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs bored home?

Flu kills somewhere 23k 61k high low last 10 years. think that‚Äôs covid near future hits endemic. same! dammit I'm sure they've gotten vaccine now. They're greedy stupid. One thing, that's misunderstanding Gambler's Fallacy means.

The Gambler's Fallacy idea past events bearing probability event occuring event independent.

If someone wins roll heads, proceeds roll tails 6 times row, would falliceous say ""Well due come heads now."" No, probability still 0.5

What *isn't* fallacy state probability coin flip coming heads approaches 1 number coin flips increases. Put another way, say chance 10 coin flips comes tails pretty low, even lower 20 coin flips. 

Likewise, fallacy say number DNA replication events increases, probability specific mutation arising approaches 1. 

It would fallacy say ""Well, virus circulating pretty widely year, we're due new variant soon."" ""We seen mutant immune escape yet probably see one."" Delta boy summer trust government trust science. Come vaccine soon able happy get booster needed. I‚Äôm certain believe go pharmacy wherever vaccines given say don‚Äôt ID don‚Äôt insurance they‚Äôll give regardless. Exposed infected two different things, neither one really matters.

I'm expecting something par latest Jurassic park movies. I've researching tremors movies friends covid. We're ... #5 next think LA county others already require masks indoor public settings. CDC absolutely correct. Case counts lower, vaccines time prevented 90% infections vaccinated people ‚Ä¶ soon case counts go like June, they‚Äôll probably go back stance earlier summer

Covid always going us CDC least knows that. doesn‚Äôt mean wear mask indefinitely I'm sure exactly Florida, around March-ish pent-up demand really sent prices soaring Florida. restrictions reinstated areas, people rescheduling come wide open Florida. Key West, rates record levels. no-frills hotel $500+ night.  animal reservoirs. can't eliminated anymore. taken seriously start might stopped it.... NY times break downs % rates vaccinated vs unvaccianted: 

Oklahoma puts weekly document really detailed, breaking breakthroughs vaccine type: sure gives looking what's point?

The cases Covid are, especially unvaccinated immunocompromised people, higher number variants emerging. higher number variants given period, higher odds more-serious/vaccine-dodging one, simply shear numbers. countries would kill position

Depends country. I'm NY still pretty anxiety inducing, man holding fast compared south. think difference we're like 3-4% positivity rate people already take action stop getting worse, south like 40% they're still nothing. know helpful analogy, dad Navy World War II. joined right high school like many did.

He got Navy 22, ended getting college degree till 26 Ph.D 28. common thing time, understood war caused people delay completion education several years. dad commented many times actually good thing him, since much serious college student result starting later.

I'm wondering going similar generation kids whose education also pushed back bit result pandemic. someone graduates high school 20, instead 18, seems like something make much difference big picture, millions it, probably even notable. Wearing mask getting vaccine aren‚Äôt hand hand thing. mitigation factors getting sick. one, doesn‚Äôt mean shouldn‚Äôt current spread warrants it. Getting vaccine #1 way protect form getting hospitalized dying, doesn‚Äôt mean masks doesn‚Äôt also help preventing spread vaccinated. data changes virus understanding there‚Äôs perfect answer it. Guidances change date data comes in. sides botched whole thing.‚Äù 

Bullshit Majority good enough. antivaxx crowd almost obnoxious disease itself. children suffering people can't right thing.

Let's remove emotions piece said look cold financial toll. Birth declines America observed already. children dying Covid. hits large enough number, current system social security last. already problems due baby boomers retirement. less children previous generation enough social security income taxes pay dumbass generations them? slippery slope we've begun heading down.

I condemn going followed laws. can't understand scientific study believe conspiracy. good spin people likely get covid risk death. Thus population thinned dumb survive people.  continue play piano them. get vaccinated get tested goes!  celebrate going spreading disease. fully approve damn Vaccine already.

Hype fear reached level yet, soon bet. imagine money made convince politicians buy vaccines every animal around. athletes professional sports likely get waiver bet? make teams entering LA forfeit immunocompromised at-risk conditions?

Exponential growth cases come quicker react. believe would tested weekly allowed work result comes back positive. may end ART test gives results within minutes. Best comment today! CDC make mandates, end them. CDC simply said vaccinated people worry masks anymore.

It politicians decided meant removing everything.   Yeah like get car get seatbelt what? We're still expected follow speed limit drive defensively? That's insane - what's point wearing seatbelt give freedom drive like jackass. unfair. access vaccine systematically less others. I‚Äôm saying isn‚Äôt, that‚Äôs something addressed. Making sure communities equal access vaccines important. particular race ethnicity declines get vaccines reasons access, don‚Äôt think would disproportionately effect behind choices. think try gathering limits warnings celebrations year, they'll almost totally ignored. People giving another holiday season, especially post vaccines. true regarding infections, they‚Äôre still pretty equal preventing serious cases death. choose today, would Moderna, Pfizer still really good it‚Äôs one get. Boosters likely coming soon well. word you‚Äôre looking Indigenous. chose poorly got J&amp;J single dose? little concerned read study stated J&amp;J nearly effective vs delta options are. million people already lied way 3rd dose, think difficult legitimately. don‚Äôt see reason company would pay pocket, weekly tests unvaxxed people long term. What? definitely data vaccinated people contracting virus. Transmitting virus questionable. Last heard, it'll take 10 years vaccinate whole world.

Both kids tested problems. mean, kinds also, come quarantine early said big one use. would definitely tested early easier swab! interval theory (if correct) also means booster likely give strong immunity Delta even tailored specifically variant.  don‚Äôt know people desperate disprove good news. *want* vaccinated people COVID? professors reasonable people going dock legitimately sick. attendance rules tend people skip class sleep in. that's sad... :( thoughts &amp; prayers parents child. We'll get boys R&amp;D it. They'll come something within 6-9 years. bad faith actor, traitor Florida, USA,and humanity. Since mRNA sequence functionally identical, likely dosing schedule (extra week Moderna)and amount (3x much Moderna, potential accidents diluting raw vaccine incorrectly). Eh, overall population density may higher, alone poor comparison comes California. LA population density ~8k SF population density ~18k. Oakland ~7k. major cities counties make bulk population vastly densely packed Florida, it‚Äôs places like central valley thats sprawl.

Florida incredibly dense cities like Miami (and many small cities connected.) Even though state it‚Äôs densely packed, go population said densely packed cities, CA beat.

California also booming comes indoor activities, they‚Äôve available months areas. Places packed people finally able go first time almost year. People tend spend large amount time indoors summer much CA too, given heat.

It really comes vaccination masking. People definitely masking N95 looks ‚Äúserious‚Äù wouldn‚Äôt wear one. They‚Äôd rather cloth bedazzled look. 

That said, official recommendations still change. That‚Äôs gotta merit somewhere‚Ä¶I think Perfect I'm already this. thought kids getting sick? going hospital. Ffs gonna take people wake up. that's dumb... using weakness them. 

‚ÄúIf want anti vax stance, free so. Please register federal anti vax registry, track verify registered federal list may waive vaccination.‚Äù

They‚Äôll vaccinated within seventy two hours.

It‚Äôs likely around 1%. importantly, actual number tested cases among children (and adults extent) likely much lower actual number cases. Kids especially undercounted fewer symptomatic cases. Wishful thinking. Without additional measures mandatory masking, contact tracing, indoor dining restriction group size limitations, vaccines alone known insufficient. Different companies separate research develop vaccine. government funded one company failed develop safe effective vaccine would seriously hurting.

And

The probability specific mutation occurs least DNA replication period time.

The first one depends mutation rate. second depends many total DNA replications occur directly proportional many people infected. Lolwut?

But humans can‚Äôt even fathom purposefully using new ‚Äúdigital currency‚Äù daily lives. makes conspiracists adamant happen hasn‚Äôt? 

Many minorities use example CIA Crack CIA Syphilis. people even believe kinds things ‚Äúmandatory vaccinations‚Äù actually right act live way puts general public danger. Constitution get jail free card want without consequences.

Even General Washington forced soldiers vaccinated Smallpox...which arguably helped us win Revolutionary war. Sooo... want claim patriotic duty reason... ya go. enough changed policy try prevent this?

No that's bad flu season. However, thousand sick children infect bunch unvaccinated adults, many clog hospitals die. warrants change policy.  Scores. large areas world unvaccinated thus provided LOT ground mutations. I, too, would like see ‚Äústudies‚Äù elected board tells superintendent votes things. 

This sounds lot like VP Mike Pence ratify votes presidential, certain man-baby upset it. History repeats itself. makes sense think first two kind like: ‚Äòhey body, what‚Äôs attack.‚Äô like ‚Äòoh okay‚Äô kind flat footed. third shot body would like ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs it! ATTACK!!‚Äù

Or least that‚Äôs imagine it. Yeah, unvaccinated *are* breeding ground new variants vast majority unvaccinated worldwide developing world. 
It‚Äôs extra sad/embarrassing there‚Äôs even chance new variants could emerge US due pure ignorance stubbornness, rest breeding ground lack vaccine access. they're putting others risk. that's extremely selfish. sympathy willfully refuse take vaccine sake selfish gain. study last year showed people wore glasses regularly seemed coming covid less small percentage. noticed wear readers work time. don‚Äôt remember details. True.

The 3 us everyday smokers avoided covid. make argument every business shoving us back offices right schools open COVID spiking. Even none us die long term effects, you‚Äôre risking weeks entire teams going down, mention abject misery. I‚Äôve disgusted leadership pretty much every sector since March 2020. Dude, figure out. vast majority people ICU dying unvaccinated. Half Florida unvaccinated, hyper virulent delta running right them. vaccine matters people use it. wish people thought like this:

* want get many people possible vaccinated
* lots ways try drive up: marketing campaigns, sending people door door, setting mobile vaccine clinics, etc.
* invest money effective way: get highest number people vaccinated least amount money
* direct payments effective strategy, go that

Put another way: we're trying get water people, invest creating artificial weather machines hand bottles water?

You vaccinated absolutely plays critical role making sure get worse. talking life form (debatable) makes millions copies itself, possibility mutating advantageous strains cap put helps.

If means making sure body fight faster... That's reduction chances. means symptoms hospitalize you, kill you... That's positive outcome.

Even assuming conclusions lack critical thinking true , much higher chance vaccine help neighbors hurt.

I mean arguing 96% even good enough you...when dropped 96% cuz people get original vaccine prevent type mutation.

For floor traders, every second counts. doubled coughing fit, gonna miss trades lose money. see golden opportunity kill rabble. Dude, like another poster said, govt forcing get vaccinated. 

You choose stay invaccinated can't go indoor establishments without proof vaccination. 

A vaccine mandate means govt setting condition you¬†returning society participating particular activity. condition vaccinated.

It get lot better US. Tons unvaccinated people running around restrictions means everyone exposed higher viral load, vaccinated no, that's cases highest world continuing climb.

Compare US Canada. Canada almost totally reopened now. Higher vaccination rates 10% iirc, least Ontario still wearing masks indoors businesses etc. US like 10x new cases per capita compared Canada right now. I've seen R=3 vaccinated people without masking precautions.

I'm moral dilemma know do. work, stay hunkered down. kid seen store since March last year, in-person school month year took back out.

I'm mainly concerned getting procedure, giving son. kn95 could probably ask n95 hospital, 6-8 hour thing plus prep, I'd point drink eat. know room people getting chemo, I'd around others.

  Two-thirds Americans highly vaccinated counties live coronavirus hot spots, according analysis Washington Post, outbreaks highly transmissible delta variant ‚Äî concentrated poorly vaccinated pockets ‚Äî ignite populated immunized areas. Post analysis illustrates rapidly state pandemic changed July problem unvaccinated nationwide concern. Post classified highest top quarter counties high vaccination, least 54 percent population fully vaccinated. lowest quarter counties classified low vaccination, fewer 40 percent population fully vaccinated. CDC identifies hot spots areas high rising caseloads, compared areas moderate low covid-19 outbreaks.

On Fourth July, four percent residents highly vaccinated communities lived hot spots, compared 13 percent people low-vaccination areas. outbreaks initially grew poorly vaccinated areas, 28 percent residents lived hot spots July 14, compared 13 percent residents highly vaccinated communities.The gap narrowed recent weeks cases surged major West Coast cities, South Florida urban centers New York-to-Boston corridor. August, closed. two-thirds residents living highly poorly vaccinated counties hot spots high rising caseloads.

Their experiences same. It‚Äôs like difference trailer house hurricane: might get hit, one harder other. Living hot spot vaccinated today much safer living hot spot unvaccinated last summer. High-vaccination states one-third number new cases per capita low-vaccination states. Hospitalization rates states less 40 percent population fully vaccinated four times higher states least 54 percent vaccinated, Post found.

Oregon seeing differences hospitalizations reach all-time highs Portland, county two-thirds fully vaccinated, hot spot alongside sparsely vaccinated rural counties. ‚ÄúWe dealing new foe that‚Äôs much contagious, doesn‚Äôt require high percentage unvaccinated people spread spreading faster parts state seeing lower vaccination rates,‚Äù said Dean Sidelinger, Oregon‚Äôs state epidemiologist. ‚ÄúThose counties higher vaccination rates fairly slow rise hospitalizations, counties lower vaccination rates much steeper rise hospitalizations.‚Äù

Public health leaders highly vaccinated hot spots attributed outbreaks several reasons. Even urban areas boast high vaccination rates hundreds thousands millions susceptible unvaccinated residents greater risk contracting virus earlier spikes businesses reopened. Masks often required public, delta variant spreads easily. Well-vaccinated areas bubbles: Infected visitors spreading virus residents traveling poorly vaccinated places getting sick. Breakthrough infections appear extremely rare hoped, accounting fifth new recent infections Los Angeles; New Haven, Conn.; Oregon, officials said. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt think county city well vaccinated can‚Äôt affect you,‚Äù said Jennifer Avegno, director New Orleans Department Health. ‚ÄúDo things need do, particularly schools returning large festivals happening. Get ready. hope spared, didn‚Äôt think would bad.‚Äù

Louisiana, less 38 percent residents fully vaccinated, confronting nation‚Äôs worst surge 120 new daily cases per 100,000 residents. Orleans Parish, home New Orleans, 53 percent residents fully vaccinated, still pummeled surge, 89 new daily infections per 100,000 residents. ‚ÄúThe problem large reservoir unvaccinated individuals surrounding island highly vaccinated place going lot transmission,‚Äù Avegno said.

That doesn‚Äôt mean city‚Äôs vaccination efforts naught. Residents Orleans Parish far lower hospitalization rate 16 per 100,000 versus statewide 46 per 100,000, according Covid Act data cited local health officials. city‚Äôs hospitals still strain covid-19 patients sparsely vaccinated rural areas lack quality hospitals arrive care. city doesn‚Äôt reliable data prevalence breakthrough infections, Avegno suspects may common. cited recent Centers Disease Control Prevention study outbreak Provincetown, Mass. three-quarters infected fully vaccinated, bolstering suspicions vaccinated people easily spreading transmissible delta variant even vaccinated communities. 1,000 people infected; seven hospitalized.

The study raised concerns among public health officials highly vaccinated communities immunized people spreading virus vulnerable people, including children 12, eligible vaccines. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt want begin see outbreaks children,‚Äù said Lori Freeman, chief executive National Association County City Health Officials. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs people choose get vaccinated; it‚Äôs people simply cannot get vaccinated either.‚Äù

Los Angeles County one first recognize risk urged residents wear masks late June imposed indoor mask mandate mid-July, even though 61 percent eligible people fully vaccinated time. Officials cited data Israel suggesting vaccinated people may spreading highly contagious delta variant. fears appeared well founded: quarter July infections among fully vaccinated people. ‚ÄúWhen don‚Äôt know something don‚Äôt know something well, learned lesson covid better cautious,‚Äù said Barbara Ferrer, director Los Angeles County Department Public Health.

Severe illness among rare, vaccinated making 12 percent hospitalizations late July. less 1 percent 5 million Los Angeles County residents fully vaccinated year tested positive. Los Angeles County health officials credit universal masking order helping control latest surge, citing slower case growth parts California without mask mandates. Ferrer said wary California‚Äôs June 15 full reopening start. Even though vaccinated people individuals protected, communities live woods major jurisdiction reached 80 90 percent immunity experts believe necessary protect delta outbreaks.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard sort say point without community immunity, going hands-off operation,‚Äù Ferrer said. ‚ÄúThe transmission, chance mutations chance one mutations may evade vaccines.‚Äù

While much summer coronavirus surge concentrated South around Ozarks, cities Northeast started emerge hot spots. CDC last week dubbed New first Connecticut jurisdiction high risk transmission even though 62 percent fully vaccinated. 624 New cases reviewed since July, 22 percent fully vaccinated. Health Director Maritza Bond said preliminary data suggests breakthrough cases disproportionately among senior citizens people preexisting medical conditions would make harder immune systems fight virus, even vaccination.

The virus also appears coming elsewhere: 93 summer surge cases involved out-of-state travel, including hot spots like Florida, 17 traveled internationally. city quickly imposed indoor mask mandate took effect week ahead vaccinated Yale University students returning campus later month. ‚ÄúYes, it‚Äôs tough wear mask again. Trust me, I‚Äôm happy wear mask,‚Äù Bond said. ‚ÄúWe prudent really tough get this, going get really reach herd immunity. country, nowhere near that.‚Äù least agree healthy marriage looks like. sad, expected result given amount time, money, energy spent indoctrinating US population believing current economy political system working dandy  think explains labor shortage. deaths happened retirement age.   Yeah cancer treatment require go emergency room  guess they'll fact kill communities then

¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø No, means vaccines help manage symptoms, prevent transmission, like we've known six months

So preventative policy needs continue rely behavioral factors, like masks lockdowns, control spread Yeah, state also recently stopped reporting hospitalizations children, something previously reported since beginning pandemic.

Our governor die hard Trump follower pulled back making mask mandates. wants people make ""individual choices"".

About two weeks ago leading university Mississippi State University reissued mask mandate classrooms buildings. every university followed (Ole Miss, Southern, etc). Usually public schools follow universities point many public schools already started classes.

Boom, started seeing outbreaks schools hide it. COVID testing easy obtain parents sick children started getting tested contacting schools. schools alert parents ""We've cases"".

Meanwhile hospitals slammed ass. ZERO ICU beds. bad it? Tupelo Hospital (the largest rural hospital state) using Emergency Room house patients. That's right people beds Emergency Room waiting room floors open up.

We waiting major university say ""We going back online fall"". rumored done last day withdraw college course passes (so make money).

Translation: shit show folks.  think wants quit. think he's scared losing wife would probably use argument try take parental rights away.

Ugh, I‚Äôm disgusted world. Also, terrified niece go back school state requiring masks banned‚Ä¶ four weeks date

It take longer 4 weeks vaccinate school district. least, mRNA vaccines take longer month first dose reach full vaccination.  Optimistically, 8 weeks minimum required, would likely take longer. Parents need time schedule vaccination parents responsible vaccination .

Driving J&amp;J low income communities huge mistake, questionable start lowest efficacy, something communities noted.

These communities also likely self-research distrust, making vulnerable misinformation.

Southern released early May last year. yes yes also send request states needed like extra 2500 healthcare workers help well isn‚Äôt take away comment think k absolutely something prevent this, covid slept like 12+ hours day. fatigue hit hardest.  better acknowledge reality try better.

This common misconception Tuskegee.

They infected syphilis rather denied penicillin, treatment choice time becoming widely available.

A difference distinction even still deplorable terrible Word word CBS Morning week, representative form CDC said appearing likely vaccinated spreading Delta variant almost much unvaccinated. Yes, vaccine still stops people getting severely sick, big argument forcing vaccination stops spread people. 

But again, representative CDC states national television vaccinated longer stops spread, argument requiring vaccination help others individual? got STEM degree understand science changes adapts still defend argument requring vaccinations help community stop spread. saying modern society status victim leads illogical positions ultimately reinforce victim status. 

I saying minorities face issues maybe convincing every institution, including medical full brim white supremacists helpful.

Ironically much fears republicans boil misguided victimhood mentality. society get them, can't trust anyone, government's never done anything start now...

Unfortunately society encourages groups cocoon misinformation bubbles like-minded people also tell course mad listen government. 

No amount self flagellation medical community going address last point. mean yea, almost certainly going endemic. But, spreads animals. helpful, already past point would even matter stubborn, stupid, ignorant, etc. people are.

Interestingish read becoming endemic well   GMO mosquitos. trial work seems successful understandable hesitation release man modified insect ecosystem. far, data looks favorable. 50% automobile collision fatalities people wearing seatbelt. 50%! can't get since read last year. can't even imagine wearing seatbelt literally thousands die because....I even know reason. odds becoming infected, date, 3-6% everyone US.

My understanding takes 2%-3% entire work force cause chaos. Here's example. co about10-15 subcontractors, mostly South Eastern Seaboard. One smaller company early week, 2 post high school employees become infected. business quarantine. expected production stopped. west coast alternative; that's are, biz part, stopped. That's 5% employees infected. Thank Los Angeles, school starts next week they're wearing masks getting tested week.  Annoying, I'm glad they're way. never guns masks. always way. Nobody go unaccounted-for data. would speculation. I'm going recorded. Perhaps right, there's nothing reference. like estimated 900,000 deaths US. Probably. But, 600,000 verified.

Anyway, country, verified cumulative covid cases country. sound better? pointed there's lot animals catch test positive covid-19, evidence many animals spread vectors humans, seem able pass back humans, that's massive distinction. Hit-and-run.

""Masks work schools!"" ghost.

Probably Russian. stupid. One two. Or, maybe Rand Paul, protecting wifes investment Remsivir.   asked volunteers polio vaccine around 600,000 children willingly participate. People vaccines then. I'm old enough missed chickenpox vaccine couple years even one pain ass low disease totem pole compared everything else get vaccinated for. also could get shingles point hear much annoying painful chickenpox.   Replace hires younger, diverse generations. like job requires extensive education. Everyone going immunity gets better. come back yearly like common flu.

I expect going following phases:

1) initial outbreak, lockdowns. 
2) Vaccins arrive distrubuted fast possible.  
3) government encouraging non-vaxxers positive pressure, lotteries.  
4) government encourages non-vaxxers negative pressure. consequences extra costs things cannot do.  
5) Time let pandemic burn out. vaxxed get it.

Unfortunately vaccinations done 10x faster infections natural way. many anti-vaxxers last phase pandemic may take time. 

The government may eventually choose encourage infections let virus burns dry wood faster. 

This would speed economic recovery, may terrible effects healthcare systems hospitals.

One solution may become acceptable long limit hospital care non-vaccinated patients. Heartbreaking maybe plausible way forward? Theyre going long term ramifications lack socialization subpar schooling. crap. even though kids rarely around kids.


Then brother told couldn‚Äôt see kids intentionally trying get sick whooping cough (????) apparently subscribed shedding idea long became hot (idiotic) take covid anti-vaxxers. oh? ive seen top scientists say doesnt stop / reduce transmission. ill go look said. thanks answering :) suggesting ""pro-virus party"" AKA red team, influence college kids minorities overwhelmingly vote blue? are....that's hilarious logic get back ""red team bad team"". Sending letters sending kids symptoms home policy change. bare minimum applies flu school outbreaks well.  
The article says many Mississippi school districts already mask mandate, person asking terms policy change? stupid hypothetical 1000 children make full recovery. 

It's ""won't someone think children!!!"" 

Covid roughly dangerous children 

RSV kills 100-500 children (under 5 yo) per year USA.

Again, assuming seriously ill elderly, curious booster translates serious illness road. Guess find month two. ask, narrow worldview.

Okay. tried, guess. believe totally connected datasphere, something like this, can't states make individual agreements share vaccination records? state record, consented this, want travel Hawaii, restriction, state allow access vax record?

We‚Äôve curious seeing COVID/RSV paired articles youngest actually got RSV last week February 2020. seen lot evidence vaccinated asymptomatic spreaders. well can't ""pull stops"" US can't mandate vaccines top down. literally take years vaccinate even 80% citizens. pivot think vaccines prophylactics, like flu vaccines. flu campaigns focused immunizing everyone, rather target older at-risk ppl, well high-contact public-facing jobs.  Jesus‚Ä¶ well fair don‚Äôt think vaccine approved use pigs Almost there's pandemic going around 2 10 years passed yet, one cam disprove that. However, evidence points long term side effects, certainly death. Reactions vaccines occur shortly vaccine given.  Masks kids!? living? China? Poor people. Yep. unvaxxed test positive get pay. universe sports important anyone's lives.

Welcome public universities US, basically football programs teach classes side. hope comes nicely, that's 'begging question' means. good day :) Okay getting sick suffering long term effects? think 1000 bad wait till hear many kids get cold. wearing mask school? kids \*should\* wearing masks. I'm sure keep quarantine though. like going tug heartstrings though. people care kids getting shot school ones think cold, believe all. 1000 kids could die move needle inch. wait time COVID bed Tupelo hospital 50 hours! It‚Äôs batshit right Sounds like could cut covid related ER visits/hospitalizations good chunk. something doctors could prescribe in-home use, seems important, know we've found anything pharmaceutical could help home before. governor actually seems care preventing Covid spread least That‚Äôs really point article. point is- highly vaccinated population curb stomp chance surge. Outbreaks fizzle out. That‚Äôs saw Provincetown well. trend hope continues future. people start seeing bodies stacked streets (which happen obviously)

We nearly NYC last spring... room mortuaries. Get office yesterday. mean that's type source relying on... Police cap iq. So, yeah. mean catch COVID? keeping face base. Facebook post yesterday blamed nurses Healthcare workers wanting work.

I hate he's governor. delta faster(luckily?)

It takes people 5 days die get better, opposed weeks months. Also much less percentage vaccinated ppl ‚ÄúThose rookie numbers!‚Äù said DeSantis Criminal negligence.

Parents? GOP? school board?

Is fucking difference point? wait see they're covering deaths now. Yeah. don‚Äôt give fuck people vaccine hesitant. It‚Äôs like idiots know difference 2 months review vs. 6. Fuck that‚Äôs crazy. elementary schools near couldn‚Äôt that. Wayyyy many kids, enough room outside. remember going school elementary, awesome playgrounds fields, it‚Äôs Prop classrooms replaced those. live *not counting* exact number colleges mandating vaccines know quite are.

Move on...  Exactly. Requirements vaccine mandates go back 100 years US, nothing new. ""authoritarianization"" taking place US, free today ever been, ask minority, woman, lgbtq person age 50 today vs born. used draft teenagers send war fucks sake.

What changed paranoia reactionary politics basic mandates always existed.

Also important distinguish constitutional concept liberty versus perverse newer concept ""freedum."" constitution grants freedoms based individual liberties. spray pray generalized notion freedom allegedy applies everything sun. That's anarchy. Get popcorn  also literal contract one makes renting property someone? stay long pay you? landlords supposed deprived legal recourse get people properties non-payment?

Yes. 65 here, youth, vaccination *apolitical*. Everyone got them, save small isolated religious sects. again, internet social media drive disinformation every corner world elevate youtube videos twitter posts board certified immunologists national health organizations eyes much population.

It frustrating see many people social media blaming low vaccination rates ""boomers"". Boomer here! getting vaccinated high rates, like parent poster says, across political stripes. local area, 90% age bracket fully vaccinated. rate falls steeply lower age brackets. young people raised internet getting them, us old farts. internet mostly good thing, every way. least informed given louder voices best informed, conclusion-shopping become normalized. also missed chicken pox vaccine several years, miserable, it, I've shingles twice even painful. think lot folks younger never gone anything worse flu realize difference quality life vaccines make.

I‚Äôm also young healthy risk, doctor still recommended get well vast majority doctors. can‚Äôt trust doctor, go ahead ‚Äúyoung healthy‚Äù way every medical issue going forward. Plus, someone unvaccinated exposed covid much likely contract spread someone received vaccine. simply vaccines work nature. breakthrough cases, 95% efficacy means.

Black people skeptical vaccine giving 5G Bill Gates microchips, they're (rightly) skeptical healthcare professionals looking best interest see hear word mouth experiences still happening daily along seeing peer reviewed studies show they're under-served medical professionals, top history experimentation government upon particular population.

That's whole point vaccines, traditionally. Imagine someone told ""yeah probably get measles. scarred life it. probably live!"" Still psyched MMR?

""You die get it""

A. That's necessarily true.
B. Death I'm worried about. I'm worried Standards living directly limited long term effects covid.

This reasonable fear. does/did school start there? way they're going there's going one guy holding every beer state. Florida gonna shit beer. It‚Äôs important note districts mandatory reporting, less half actually reporting numbers state.  fuck talking about? asking sign referring to. Make sure report breakthrough cases CDC   Markets already responding people still talking drug? punishing anyone, avoid spread deadly disease. Absolutely shocking. mean Florida letting member public see numbers.   first time realized hell lot people like people died covid? survive doesn‚Äôt mean 100% better. civilization wiped preventable diseases spread settlers. learned hard way.  system vaccinated patients literally displace unvaccinated hospital bed they're occupying? ""lockdown"" pretty half-hearted first time. There's zero appetite another. Let's take laser targeted approach situation now. vaccinated bear burden unvaccinated. unvaccinated need feel pain consequences decisions, point denied medical care vaccinated person also seeking finite resource. Fuck em. crime humanity Treating people literally killing extremely disheartening. someone posted actual answers, anyone hasnt seen it. take 2\^10 calculator compare 1.9\^10 see big difference minor change  exposed Delta strain extent would gotten sick vaccinated, estimated 42% less likely become sick exposure. basically probability infection situation given vaccinated times 42%, would imagine less 50% cases (i.e. likely avoid catching it). happy cake day bad, probably dumb shit read remembered. reality people forced position, pregnant baby want, still choose get one. ""The moral abortion abortion""  i.e. get re-elected. wife teacher terrified returning school. can‚Äôt tell many times she‚Äôs broken thought kids getting sick feeling powerless protect them.

First carrot, stick Good them!! subject kids cult governing body mandates cloths face child!! Focus death rate contraction rate! Shots stop spread. Even shot natural immunity. still get it! People easily programmed. program kids think like adults watch alarm news follow trends scare persuade you! How? possible? could known??!!

Oh please Lord reveal mysterious ways see zero chance happening especially US.  Pro-life ends birth canal. sad can't part collective effort. Cull parent. Voluntary antivaxxers get Covid, given (and charged for) hydroxychloroquine, zinc, UV lamp sent home. That‚Äôs need, right!  
Leave beds believe science doctors. Amazing many science denying spreadnecks run hospital catch virus. Abbott Pennywise something? man loves killing children. Yes, new. got care flighted Temple, think. vent &amp; recover.

But says lot one th top children‚Äôs hospitals world diversion - whole county. Basically. government spent like 3 years figuring people essentially voted guaranteed recession. they‚Äôre starting live ever happened Biden lifting patents? didn‚Äôt even push Europeans all. It‚Äôs emoty PR rhetoric. 

Why don‚Äôt factories world coming online ending thing 2024? study used blood four groups - vaccine infection, prior infection, infection plus one shot,  fully vaccinated. Delta, prior infection 47% effective. compared 88% effectiveness Alpha Beta - older variants. Prior infection plus one shot 100% - even bit effective two shots people never infected. 
Also, sure false CDC statement. data submitted trials showed took 14 days vaccinated placebo groups diverge symptomatic COVID. Moderna also submitted data caught asymptomatic infections. protection infection versus Delta reduced, zero means. protection hospitalization still strong. immediate shot, they're saying. anti-vaxxers even goto doctor goto pet store meds. top that, MHSAA (state public school athletic commission) decided step announced yesterday ""Any school goes virtual play fall sports"". force many schools stay face face play football.

This infuriating part me. universe sports important anyone's lives.

Fuck shit.

My kid's school sent notice everyone required mask, like last year. issues returning person classes mid-January. I'm still iffy it. ok last year, went virtual things community went crazy. seem making good decisions. excuses. Get vaccinated allowed engage public gatherings. Period.

And BS claim J&amp;J ""directed"" black communities proof racism load shit too. First all, J&amp;J keep hospital alive well mRNA vaccines. Secondly, idea many municipalities use J&amp;J vaccine working class communities less medical infrastructure need one dose, people potentially miss work find way get mass vaccination center twice effectively protected. families (and even friends) gave us much shit it.

That's ridiculous! People selfish.  Wait, hell world population now?

Edit holy crap 8 billion.  International air travel thing 1918 though (or almost human history). Humanity across globe physically interconnected point history, clearly proving huge problem.

I'm suggesting completely seal borders everywhere, saying past data points may completely reflective quagmire we're now. actually counting?! LOL. combine long Covid, taking time family member ICU, massive amount inflation making anything $13 hour even survivable regions even working 60 hours week, etc. employees, kids believe. Homeboy left Yes. Every year. We've *two* significant mutations SARS-CoV-2 (Alpha Delta) within *half year*. thought common knowledge, okay. thousand children million way. yahoos won‚Äôt get kids shot. Even New England like 25% 12-17 immunized. disappointing! I'll go moment give us green light. I‚Äôd rather monthly change mind seeing hit months. 

$7500 sounds great well though. Maybe people feel one time payments harder. Good point. looked way before. That's I'm waiting for. would like know time period shots 2 3 mix brands gives best effectiveness. wish spaced 2 apart impact well researched yet.  Likely coughing lungs out. probably tested severe cases kids brought doctor urgent care ""bad cold"" least states shocked amount news stories first hand accounts keep reading hospitalized people family members dead people say ""they way antivaccine. busy gotten around getting it."" Like I'm sorry what. busy get 2 minute shot last 7 months? can't decide that's embarrassed antivaxxers trying save face getting insanely sick what.... please call hospitals world let know masks effective closed spaces, operating room? I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôd love know get good laugh idiot. man left behind! 

Democrats abominable marketing. Masks starting become required quite sad blame. Oh irony college student part time job th e mastermind evil infringing rights breathe ( blaming)

The view masks seen throughout pandemic america extremely odd.
- first ‚Äú masks wearing dont protect husband firefighter ‚Äú
- ‚Äú can‚Äôt breathe shop‚Äù
- ‚Äú take chances ‚Äú
- ‚Äú rights infringed‚Äù

Confusion selfishness insult.

Masking sick new thing, example Japan, years also colleagues.

The difference america never thought help person. strongly affected pandemic pretty much learn accept live it.

Except gonna ""live"" it. pandemic disproportionately impacted minorities. Look death rates race, black people impacted orders magnitude more. death rate black people 50% higher white people, thus far. solution, save communities keep *is* outdated many, many cases subsequent years bolstered bodily autonomy. 

While I'd like think slam dunk case, actually believe is. court tends avoid sweeping proclamations bodily integrity instead weighs common good, interest state, rights individual case-by-case basis. Jacobson v Massachusetts might help, might hurt, court could draw comparison relatively low death rate Covid compared smallpox. 

The real answer question whether covid vaccine mandate would legal know sure, know goes court. DeSantis face criminal charges over.  lack empathy. group lost cause much easier reach actual antivaxxers.

You want yourself, dismissal adds conflict groups get vaccinated, hurting rest us. DeSantis variant think need add obsessed appearing scared. Somehow wearing mask sign weak showing giving ""freedom"". saw doc today routine thing. He's send people serious conditions hospitals hours away. 

My doctor's office opposite side hospital's parking lot. completely full. Every hospital area. people non-COVID emergencies med-flighted states  So, light increasing numbers, likely another mandatory shutdown situation? far know, CDC counting breakthrough infections hospitalized fully vaccinated, wild ask person would *think* breakthrough infections means, would likely say getting covid *period* fully vaccinated.

Many us want know that, many fully vaccinated people catching covid fully vaccinated.    wanted ban boosters.

Also, CDC denying necessity boosters weeks ago try sell efficacy vaccine.

So, alone sentiment.

I think there's substantial risk vaccinated adults suddenly susceptible COVID again.

Also, there's chunk US population getting vaccinated. think would fools errand keep trying convince people responsible.

With regard developing countries, absolutely agree know zero sum game. I'm saying one other. honestly know. think confusing exportation receipt information‚Äîi know reddit loves get rocks anti-US rhetoric, doesn‚Äôt mean ignore facts aren‚Äôt stupid.  tdap shot, tetatnus, dipheria, pertussis (whopping cough), one shot. Immunocompromized get vaccinated. live virus. fact elderly lower immune response need boosters. 

Same true influenza vaccine. Thats theres 65+ specific vaccine, higher concentration less strains help immune system. 65 lower concentration strains dont need much working immune system. Preprint articles require higher degree scrutiny rigor accurately evaluate many types articles. kind discussion would appropriate strictly scientific subreddit /r/COVID19.

He's asking percentage people breakthrough infections fully vaccinated, number people hospitalized compared unvaccinated hospital. know things work parent wish would give us option even means take liability. far numbers game goes would feel much better assuming liability children getting vaccine would sending school unprotected less 2 weeks. ‚ÄúGovernment needs exercise force authority individual‚Äôs medical decisions‚Äù 

If can‚Äôt identify slippery slope I‚Äôm sure tell you. wish Americans skeptical government authority like founding country. think started week know, least reasonable assume vaccine protects long covid similar degree protects hospitalization. Obviously may straightforward we'll need studies test assumption. Delta run it‚Äôs course kids 5-11 vaccinated. 2ish months it‚Äôs available + 5-6 weeks doses takes right Thanksgiving break. 

And remember, vaccines preschool / daycare kiddos quite time that. Hopefully spring summer says pediatrics group. posted r/iamatotalpieceofshit concern. long trip, even catch something, manifest quickly. hate stuck there. Airlines may bar us flying back.  Come on. mean school shooters, keeping guns them. Probably common core math implement FL Democratic party supports amendment reverse citizens united broad campaign finance reforms. Republican party advocates repeal current campaign finance restrictions. 

Neither immune bought current (terrible) system, one supports anything improve situation wants make worse. totally expected surprise. /s known RSV COVID link? 90% students *who willing answer question* vaccinated. everyone did. 

So it‚Äôs possibly 75-83% vaccinated. 

That said, it‚Äôs really ironic first reported cluster pharmacy school. Oh yes! Indeed. I‚Äôm happy unvaccinated infected gathering tents outside city talk great choices. Free good hospitals resources vaccinated Liberal Elites. üòÇ testing weekly?? makes feel little bit better. I‚Äôm terrified niece nephew going back.  also likely attempts boost capacity, like hiring traveling nurses, people cover beds, etc. NYC surge added least 1000 ICU beds.

So, ""peacetime"" comparison little tricky. anyone know common breakthrough cases are? I‚Äôve fully vaxxed Moderna since April planning going concert August 27th traveling Sept 4th. 

I went 30,000 person concert July fine, I‚Äôm hoping test negative covid test Honestly point idgaf peoples reasons getting vaccine.

Everyone reasons. use second hand info use instincts senses. everybody thinks they're right, think right, look that. think choose believe better. know unless lab tested it. 

I choose believe vaccines believe vaccines general one greatest things human achievements. computer programmer, trust taking message envelope (vaccine base) changing message inside (to match molecular structure covid), trust new vaccine development. studying statistics, trust statistical data gathered trials. faith, career education different, would different path choices. every institution, including medical full brim white supremacists helpful.

If \*true\* may need much convincing .... keep mind 45% voters voted Trump 2020, least OK white supremacy.

For people experience racism every day, form, hard extrapolate wrong.

BTW, although believe there's 30-40% Americans somewhat racist, believe there's even 1% healthcare professionals intentionally screw somebody due race (humans complicated :) Yea, that's part bigger issue here. Republicans able get lot agenda packing courts using legal system accomplish political goals. complete denial living reality.

I'm sure equipped speak that. politicians catering stupidest us

Well duh. Smart people vote them. When's ""right now""? Fred could make weather suck pretty hard weekend. Routine shots always seemed likely. ~~AXE~~ AUNT  Curious live hospitals quiet? Ok cool. I‚Äôll gladly roll sleeve time comes. Vaccines solve everything goal going ventilator dying. Yes thats european countries Delta dominant strain high vaccination rates undergoing shitshow thats happening US.

Sorry people hoped covid lifestyle extend longer hyped Delta, antivaxxers problem, ""the virus changed"" That's ultra-wealthy want. taxes ability whatever want never held responsible it. Rsv nuts area too. feel you, rough time pregnant!! think unless local communities hit point health care basic services can't delivered see lockdowns, especially broad scale. rumored done last day withdraw college course passes (so make money).

that's fucked arguments there.

With COVID, real concern long term side effects. Unlike, let's say, influenza...where kid hating life week there's aftereffects.

I mean, personally, pre-vaccination, long COVID scared me. saw younger adults (not saying much, I'm approaching 50) absolutely ruined months infection (the OG one, Delta, course)  know idiot young daughter lung issue didn‚Äôt get vaccine whole family COVID drinking homemade concoction supposed witch doctor version hydrochloroquine. 

It‚Äôs sooooo stupid. Everyone wants vaccine (and allowed one) ample chance get one. Southern states won‚Äôt put restrictions save don‚Äôt want saved. 

People get antibodies easy way (vaccine) hard way (getting sick recovering), they‚Äôll get one way other. 

No point delaying inevitable. I'll spend another 30 seconds getting free shot easily protect hospitalization? 

OK data folks become statistic unless walk hospital door take test. breakthrough infections concerning, really matters getting sick dying. Right now, answer overwhelmingly unvaccinated. appears so, yes. kids mostly fine? Glad you‚Äôve got frankly anyone working required travel would scheduled around need get vaccine. Excuses. anyone know full approval come 12-15 year olds? come full approval expected soon 16+?  ""That's fair!!!!""

Toddlers &amp; Republicans word mouth experiences

It's kind inevitable though... Childhood immune system builds repertoire adaptive immune (B T) cells make future infection less likely less severe. kids snotty nosed time. kind important. also laid bare healthcare crisis Ideally would lead better flu shots now. know Moderna working combined mRNA COVID/Flu/RSV vaccine.

Theoretically mRNA vaccines work better rapidly mutating flu existing flu vaccines. mRNA vaccines created much quickly, would less educated guessing flu strains become dominant future.

I'm honestly sure mask wearing would prevent thiings going back ""normal"" otherwise (IE limited social distancing, large events/gatherings, schoools ect)

I think right least one article recently indicating research also shows even masking required schools, *if mitigation strategies*, still expects 40% elementary school students infected within three months. kids next generation stupid. mRNA vaccines based decade's worth development SARS vaccine.

May: Moderna = 93%; Pfizer = 83% 
June: Moderna = 62%; Pfizer = 82% 
July: Moderna = 76%; Pfizer = 42%

As see, Moderna dropped 62% June popped back 76%. Obviously that's actual efficacy changing, noise data. quite possible (even likely) Pfizer's low July numbers thing. think valid (EU) corona certificate requires either proof vaccination negative covid test older X days point home school private school lol.  Already believe god. It‚Äôs wonder related dosing interval.  Moderna 4 week interval Pfizer 3 weeks.  

Some countries, Canada UK delayed second dose.  Curious see delay net positive negative impact. school district right thing despite even county's school Health Director openly stating didnt knowing masking work not. doctor btw, still RN. Sad Yup... notice among states similar vaccination rates, ones held mask mandate longest behind curve Delta's climb.

They started lower transmission, helped even months later.  exhausted typing that. realize clear. pointing get sick mean take something home work people can't vaccinated.

It raises doubts data like misleading try claim every vaccinated person got virus. would get called misinformation claiming virus isn‚Äôt dangerous 80% mild symptoms average person unlikely hospitalized die.

No one would taken coronavirus seriously year ago, today, cases counted someone hospitalized died. Pfizer, 42% effective COVID infection.

There's certainly precedent upholding vaccine mandates: [Jacobson v. mean vaccines free lot effort get vaccines, good get vaccinated, hardly obstacles. Saying obstacles getting vaccinated really implies somehow incapable completing simple tasks actually little racist imo. Good luck convincing them. Allowing everyone pretend like everything normal little great all, Americans adaptable creatures. accept situation changed extremely premature pretend allow people unvaccinated go business like normal real reason get vaccinated. 

My extremely conservative grandmother spent whole pandemic listening experts, told fine accept things changed. convinced booster shot chinese vaccine turn us communist drones easier accept somehow. sister's boyfriend followed rules whole pandemic, CDC said could go wild did, can't accept things changing bad way. like Trump responsible many deaths using governmental agencies shift narrative, Biden's CDC giving ok go hog wild everyone result countless suffering. quotes Russia EU suggest it‚Äôs still process evaluation, perhaps lack data holding up.

Lack raw data back Sputnik claims issue ever since official data first published Lancet least 6 months ago. Russians data, would submitted get approval EU. 

I think simply insufficient data backup Russian claims. different groups trying study use currently approved medicines may help. Why? We‚Äôve found drugs cross purposes like before, since known approved drug known documented side effects would need full approval process.  think needs vaccine available everyone (all age groups countries) treatment plans help reduce symptoms. 

I honestly think treatment needed hesitancy vaccine. involved 300 men single county. little different rollout 7 billion people. It‚Äôs true hospitalizations matter. Hospitalizations number matters goal prevent NHS overwhelmed. Preventing infection limits transmission viral variants well disability long covid.  Stop spreading nonsense please. ‚Äú New Orleans doctor says unvaccinated adults cause COVID spread among kids‚Äù. evidence true. vaccinated break vaccinated wearing mask carriers‚Ä¶yeah.

This kind finger pointing going nation good. need man up, vax up, mask up, wash up. 

This kind nonsense man still office would spread divide nation. vaccine 100% prevent spreading it.  
Because still need parents permission get vaccinated 18. 
Because masks work. Nothing's wrong adults. kids hate getting swabbed. hurts already runny nose. subject every week. repercussions? fuck. democrats nationally almost 90 percent vaccinated

whoa, really? Order schoolwork books online kid home. Amazon websites things. parents took sister school school year ended summer took us trip around world, mom saw school work do, way workbooks, reading, etc.  CDC representative stated ""vaccinated come contact covid 19 spreading almost rate."" say breakthrough infections clarify that, vaccinated coming contact spreading it. it? data, speculation. given recent significant surge, shocked see approval end September. Unfortunately happen lot great safety net working parents. need go work. parents deserve blame, systemic failure too. Isn‚Äôt approved already? think need stop calling 12+ kids/children. unvaccinated camp. 

It really misleading impact toddler parents. refuse get tested  Except herd immunity needs % total pop, eligible pop.

And Delta needs like 90%, 70% like OG SARS-COV-2. 

That's mistake US made. person prosecuted..... Another option (not sure recognized SF yet), get national (US) vaccine passport phone: national CA versions phone case future. kids‚Äô school board voted make masks optional. Even wasn‚Äôt enough people. Police remove people still outraged. dosing interval could important factor here. study showing 12-week interval Pfizer vaccine produced x3.5 times greater antibody response 3-week interval.

The three studies 3-4 week interval normal report effectiveness 40-55% Pfizer vaccine.

The two studies UK, 12 week interval used. PHE study positive, it‚Äôs also pretty small. REACT Study much bigger didn‚Äôt discriminate AZ Pfizer jabs. It‚Äôs likely efficacy AZ vaccine lower would brought figure down. It‚Äôs hard estimate, efficacy Pfizer jab could north 60% longer interval. Bucees? Come beaver, stay covid! outbreaks reported Aug. 2 Aug. 6
 
Nice. worries, Qualified Immunity! gets around part many districts comfortable mandating shot full FDA approval. Teachers administrators put unenviable position check person's vaccine status.

Just, bam, everyone masked, done. seen, high transmission means variants created. Also, seen impact long covid causing disability. article increase diabetes Covid. 

So need stop infection.  Mmm *looks gulf Atlantic ocean* hurricanes coming. words Chris Pratt velocicoaster, ""what go wrong""  Hope turns true, would certainly nice. Kind flip side grade inflation. profit wants lots failing students, like university doesn't.

And many college kids lazy detriment learned bad study skills always smart enough (or parents kept task). 

Without penalty, many students would skip class? understand everyone happily sending kids back full time school, situation worse many parts country EVER been. even mask classroom, soon get lunch , rip masks sitting 30 minutes breathing covid cooties other, nothing. Go back distance hybrid learning, months hopefully vax available, fully reopen. know, unpopular opinion. TLDR: trust government gotten around it. Saved click (I actually read it). Amazing it?

He's bored college kid thinking entertainment  None whatsoever Def true. Agreed, would add entire reason emergency kids seemingly unable kind sweeping federal policy advises masks, vaccines, schooling and, especially, reopening offices/protections people betting fired due illness (inevitably) quarantine kids go back WFH cause switch remote schooling (also probably inevitable.)

In NYC area, RIGHT schools going open throughout tri-state, many people know forced start going office again. There's advisory it, public outcry (other situations like Apple, one first pull back policy), nothing teachers SBA anyone regarding VERY. EASY. WIN. 

It quite literally, ""Hey, remember work-from-home thing doing? Keep kids vaccinated!"" 

I already know parents employers pretending like longer thing, wanting hear might quarantine kids suddenly switch remove schooling. 

The thing is, mandate kids wearing masks, teachers vaccine mandate that's somewhat controllable. possible reason send millions back onto mass transit Manhattan thing fine home time? 

Thankfully, work industry employer that's fully embraced WFH... kids go school kids parents basically forced back act like pandemic totally over. many died? friend mine vaxxed, positive test last week. Three days symptoms similar flu. fine afterward. still staying home 14 days. 

The vaccine means trained immune system better combat virus. vaccinated would probably hospital right now. There's sudden ""feeling"" government overreach weird fear seems gotten people hypnotized.

&amp;#x200B;

Standing six feet apart works great. way people think does. Yes, airborn viral particles easily spread 6 feet especially indoor setting. still reduces amount viral particles likely come contact with. odds catching covid someone six feet away non-zero, markedly lower catching covid someone breathing neck.

Preventative measures ironclad useful, especially public health context. feel much you. really fair see many people losing opportunities. People love say ""It's one year life put off,"" things really can't put off, least much longer.

88% doable worldwide get past dorks choose get dumb reasons. MEDICAL/PUBLIC HEALTH EXPERTS:

1) currently data suggest fully-vaccinated (Pfizer/Moderna) patient without immune disorders getting additional shot vaccine boosts immunity?

2) possible third shot could cause side effects beyond typical days feeling well? (example: overheated immune response)

3) booster shots eventually recommended vaccinated patients shots likely vaccine already received one reformulated better target Delta variants?

4) Pfizer Moderna vaccines differ enough effects would prove beneficial get both?

5) data available yet regarding likelihood reinfection patients recovered Delta variant?

I know answered educated speculation, would like understand much possible weapons fight COVID.

I cannot imagine anyone would endanger themselves, families, neighbors healthcare workers refusing vaccine saves lives, virtually zero side effects observed 100,000,000+ vaccinated course many months.

Even so, high enough rates vaccinations still likely make COVID surges unlikely occurence.   Younger healthier people immune systems finer tuned. ramp quicker turn easily. hanging skin vaccinated teeth point. believe IMO, compelling reasons mask kids school to:

* limit community spread
* limit child-specific mutations

Unless child-specific mutation comes along, kids mostly fine, you, people kids likely die hill increased community spread. want people people = consumers = $$

And that's sensible position. There's positions nothing staying locked home years, neither make sense. Make sure many people around possible vaccinated.

I get people voting I'm clearly trying understand spitting random garbage nothing back up. get hostile here, y'all upset questions? train kids adults? imagine there‚Äôs big difference treatment. Baby lungs tiny! DeSantis serious mental issues going thinks withhold salaries chose something like. Along, nonsense he's pulling.

This grandstanding sensitive Trump base. MF, shit getting enjoined. already there. simplest explanation current situation COVID-19 combination 2 things: 

1. Intelligence human population distributed bell curve. means HALF population IQ *below* average IQ. means HALF population‚Äôs ability critical thinking may compromised.

Yes, yes .  ‚Äúeducation‚Äù Undocumented Begging ventilators‚Ä¶ threatening anyone wants protect people masks‚Ä¶. assume transmission rate precautions. R0 transmission rate without precaution measures. beyond comprehension people believe otherwise. According paper THC inhibits protective effect cannabidiol no, smoking weed help avoid Covid.

Also, ""smoke weed everyday"" crowd look harmful effects chronic consumption. Probably Pediatric ICUs overloaded! boosters expected? Even Delta thing got shots January I'm worried naturally losing effectiveness. guarantee people conspiracies Democrats unvaccinated. believe it, fool comes around time spark like clockwork. perfect attendance 4 years high school, graduated ‚Äò08. sick 4-5 times doctors note; seems like count excused absence missing day. 

Is way now? Yeah, I‚Äôve got cousin got vaccinated, teen kids bc ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt want muck basketball practice schedule.‚Äù Meanwhile, they‚Äôre practicing indoors tons kids sans mask‚Ä¶ really hurry right thing.

Some people really concerned health‚Ä¶ also don‚Äôt care contribute spread &amp; perpetuate insidious situation. It‚Äôs deeply disturbing üò§ schools shut water fountains, kids either bring bottled water, buy school. two kids, I‚Äôm also ICU nurse (which contrary popular belief means nothing don‚Äôt know anything vaccines next person, know follow orders preform nursing skills).
It fault isolating child. pandemic obese, chronically ill, incredibly rare unlucky seemly health person unfortunately gets severe disease.
Turn news social media fear mongering live life stop damaging child‚Äôs mental health protect something that‚Äôs 100% less likely harm say rsv flu.  know family friend went florida bachelorette party recently. talked mom three far tested positive back state that‚Äôs three hour plane ride away. three vaxxed fwiw Oh thought redneck toothless republicans south probably B.S., that, least state, that's justifiable religious exemption reason, becoming popular thing say. allows people skirt vaccination requirement many employers mandating employees. government really screw up. Ignored virus, LIED said masks don‚Äôt work (Fauci admitted keep regular people buying masks), continuously flip flopped. It‚Äôs joke point. almost like, putting bunch unvaccinated kids together one classroom highly contagious Delta variant rages bad idea.

Who would thought??

Both RSV Covid-19 cause syncytium formation (cell fusion creating multi-nuclear cell).


Some Sars-cov-2 variants spikes cause cell-virus &amp; cell-cell fusion. (I removed link medical site bot complained political site...)


What's going CCL17 seems opposite, though...


A papers subject (I removed links papers bot thought political sites.)

Serum CCL17 level becomes predictive marker distinguish mild/moderate severe/critical disease patients COVID-19

This literally can‚Äôt true.

That‚Äôs basic math. Mississtupid... education comes last! Tribesmen non-tribesmen benefit people vaccinated. logical would allow everyone get shot. Billions millions given district Covid safety measures. install MERV's whatever else? $ go? think said yesterday ask doctor getting extra shot, case. doctor knows condition better would, would best person ask. Maybe talk Native Americans? Another group long history screwed government. People whose ancestors deliberately targeted biological warfare, people still struggle today effects racism...and yet people much higher rate vaccination.

That's understanding too. number given (3.7 days) *to positive test* seems fit relatively cleanly 4-5 days symptomatic, even little bit beforehand. Either way incubation period plus serious illness onset would seem indicate people would begin end hospitalized 11 day mark instead noticeable obviously attributable specific event. fear. ""Let's hate side go happen again"":

kids young people okay

All talking points repeated again. would thought trying appeal sports culture might impact (e.g., get vaccinated, get star QB sick), looks like far optimistic

I remember Nick Saban (who seen deity Alabama anyone Auburn fan) making bunch PSAs masking up. Yet know well Bama wrt COVID  entirely reasonable school environment regular mass testing supplement measures, practice never perfectly adhered to.

Again downside tiny bit discomfort. kids can't handle little nose swab every week hate think they'd fare actually caught COVID-19. kids infect fare wanted make sure avoided seconds discomfort.

Testing actually harm way, learning tolerate little discomfort public good worthwhile lesson.  article March 9th. thought data showing antibody/plasma therapy worked alpha variant ineffective delta? literally chance another United States lockdown. noticed 7% country took mask mandate CDC suggested it.   Well do? Lmao what? Getting real Baghdad Bob vibes. Think one way through. Here‚Äôs $1000 threaten $40k+ annual salary. Violent idiots.

They needed arrested.

Unfortunately seem breeders. tribalism, really think one sided part one tribes.... color blue statement. think *the South's gonna rise again* means. Rising death cases, Covid variants, children deaths... us FL vote blue trying turn tide .... often think. least systems around do. said see board taking situation lightly. It‚Äôs crazy think cultures welcome death America many scared die. believe donate blood Red Cross check antibodies past infection antibodies vaccine.  It‚Äôs effective stopping people contracting it. R value 7 becomes 3 vaccines level effectiveness ban masks banned mask mandates. Anyone wear mask want to. anyone sense left party leaving behind concentrated pool hatred stupidity. Exactly!

I've heard reports rate COVID-19 transmission 1 2 persons whereas Delta variant transmission 1 infected person 5 others.

Those Republican governors, school boards purveyors COVID-19 dis-information banning masks mask mandates ought charged (or diagnosed) criminally insane! Also, vaccinated doesn‚Äôt mean can‚Äôt catch it. one dude office caught fully vaccinated. Especially base ages lose appeal younger generations. got want tax break.  Where? single place forced shutdown area. sounded end September guidance boosters non immunocompromised folks based many months ago second shot. think whole thing ""delta hitting highly vaccinated country"" new nobody knows yet. AFAIK happened UK Iceland.

In UK big wave, puttered everybody's surprise, AFAIK still idea went - once, PLEASANT surprise covid :) Delta breaking vaccines currently, they're developing boosters specifically help it. Though vaccinated price tend less severe symptoms, even asymptomatic times, I've seeing. also account 0% 0-11 year olds vaccinated Sad one kids pass prob kill parent. Thank source. I‚Äôm going bet numbers sliver true cases. Wait couple weeks. understand people arrested menacing/threatening. R0 natural transmission without vaccines change lifestyle masking social distancing etc. say health condition. get cancer doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre going heart attack doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre going car accident doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre going die

We still try avoid things whenever possible. said vaccinated population, i'm sure get 7 3 knowing piece information likely due data delay. 

Yeah, trusting numbers Florida, gonna look excess deaths year find real numbers Thank you. hubris. government working business.  California recall vote governor, yet idiot actively trying help virus run rampant state. individuals twice likely reinfected COVID-19 fully vaccinated initially contracting virus.‚Äù decide boards blindly recommendation says. People making sort argument beginning pandemic ‚Äújust living life‚Äù meant accepting something like ten times deadly flu (CDC Covid deaths Americans last decade flu, that‚Äôs *with* measures took reduce spread). 
But think vaccines especially they‚Äôre cleared children really point argument reasonable. stupid dangerous open schools kids young get vaccinated step parents, siblings classes...i forgot quite ramifications think Today warning hospital system nearing total collapse. mass casualty event, think bus crash, can‚Äôt handle it. state may go diversion. children can‚Äôt protect adults failed so.

Vaccines still way forward, perfect best tell real experts never thought would be.

This pandemic end, matter time. become way adults what's best kids. tribalism. I‚Äôm gonna bet many didn‚Äôt kids, like yelling. Fire then. what‚Äôs line giving fuck?

If kid gets sick? sibling? parent? best drinking buddy? lady bakery makes best apple fritters? 

Where line caring somebody gets sick not, determine unvaccinated risking making sick fine?

Me, got vaccinated mostly don‚Äôt want get sick, don‚Äôt want get parents sick. don‚Äôt want people come contact sick spread among general, fill hospitals parents likely die get delayed treatment get car accident/fall ladder/have heart attack/get cancer whatever. No, going away last easter. It'll beautiful. Bad batch clone wars great job him. mean, zero mitigation efforts it‚Äôs guaranteed get worse.

It's tricky, say zero mitigation efforts statewide 50% eligible people fully vaccinated. problem FDA needs wrap whatever hold children 12 start vaccinated well full authorization vaccines. Texas mask mandate schools last year, lot kids online possible, COVID still spread schools pretty badly absolutely worse school year hopefully vaccines save day gets much worse. Show literature evidence someone died getting vaccine.

Risk getting super sick dying vaccine less risk getting super sick dying contracting COVID. True false. OP explicitly said even die hospitalized concerned sick.

I simply saying kids constantly sick. Every dollar state districts waste litigation money could spent educating protecting kids. They'd better taping hvac filter box fan sticking one every classroom  different conversations.  Without shadow doubt vaccine mandates lead violence. side openly calling violence (in politics) also side refusing vaccine. people many cases.  people get vaccine, great enough numbers take burden hospitals. 

My state sitting shy 50% vaccinated surpassed all-time high patients currently ICU covid. talking vaccine status. talking world let employers decide, whim, metrics fire employees based of, taking away means life. 

But want talk vaccines go right back unvaccinated easily able cause mutation get vaccinated. Oh look already have! suggesting, since made PERSONAL choice responsible that, perhaps also PERSONALLY RESPONSIBLE ensuing damages causes? get behind that. Personal choices consequences that. Largest hospital Mississippi.  people die. someone give glimmer hope good news? Wisconsin, 7 year old starting school less 2 weeks 3 year old 3 month old. ball anxiety... studies, like every study COVID date, place. However, seems bit mRNA vaccines: quickly weakening immunity less effective Delta. mRNA manufacturers US recommending boosters already. Lamar County reinstated mask policy cases identified. numbers released representative happened mask policy optional only.

Anyone look numbers even tertiary glance cases see mix middle highschool - children asymptomatic 12, makes absolute sense see many cases since reason get tested. absolutely cause spread kids go back home infect older family members. could tell incognito tab, headline accurate  Polio animal reservoirs, well one primate catch believe.

Lots animals catch form variants corona happens government screws bad often can't trusted anything, even right. Wow seems headline accurate Okay, I‚Äôm looking current reality don‚Äôt think government much power authority. SCHOOL OPENING EARLY???

Sorry hd get system. really normal now? used start september  I've saying... second week elementary middle schools open (un-vaccinated kids 12) going mass shutdown again. Oh many variants, many fools unvaccinated none ever gone, endemic point, covid stay. We're going end yearly covid shots prominent variants like flu. Thx, look them!  Saw video Uber driver trying explain company policy fired lets ride without mask. accused wanting defund police. 

These people brain poisoned. Rationality isn‚Äôt begin with. another map. An, similar headlines one day assumed repost first article. you‚Äôre vaccinated you‚Äôre beholden anyone‚Äôs whim survival. You‚Äôll survive. You‚Äôre vaccinated. That‚Äôs point getting vaxxed. you‚Äôll survive regardless anyone else‚Äôs choices. two aren‚Äôt mutually exclusive. say *better* waited. said turned unexpected benefit. literally makes zero sense lmao  saying fire them, intend replace with? Situations like OP defunding police work. really want opposite, increasing police funding selective hire officer making sure resources job properly. I'm Bay Area, we're actually pretty good here. dumb. It‚Äôll gone new one place booster approved *think* update batches worldmeters, would surprised whole day. go buckle cuz kids bout go back school. worse gets better, hopefully cases start go back October I'm definitely defending fucking gop Biden done shit help us either. mask mandate, lockdowns, stupidly false politically motivated advice like ""if vaccinated need masks"" lifting restrictions based honor system people following rules knowing damn well virtually one basically damn thing prevent spread despite power to. One may worse they're capitalists abide owners. economy must keep chugging matter many lives consumes Biden shown continue show give shit many people die, anything it. Superstition  I'm Bay Area we're actually pretty good here. None decisions involved individuals making personal medical decision. enforceable cleaning practices outside customers medical decisions. title misleading outright lie. HIPAA ensures doctor/hospital/etc disclose info without authorization. nothing choose disclose (or not) others erectile dysfunction. Although clearly implies risk factor issue here, global pandemic. find heartless best.

Edit: word Yes. I‚Äôve arguing people weeks this. Data needed safely apply boosters population- outside specific instructions specialists immunocompromised population- still tested- people need patient. one really knows really doesn‚Äôt matter since dealing Delta almost exclusively point. like public schools south? fallen prey many self-destructive alluring instincts identified last year. went one countermeasure‚Äîvaccines‚Äîand traded masks protective measures. succumbed magical thinking acting variant ravaged India would spare country half population still hadn‚Äôt vaccinated. stumbled normality trap, craving return carefree days 2019.

Pretty much. I'm wondering anyone else saw article co written one Moderna's founders skeptical Biden's push global vaccination. brought points controversial can't find anywhere now. read morning (I think NY Times article, can't quite remember early) assume written within last days. 

It's really bothering can't find now, anyone knows I'm talking about, would appreciated. friend pretty adamant media censoring certain point views, able find article kind supports point eyes. Would love find it! higher dosage may play part, impossible compare solely formulations same. issue Moderna almost usage vaccine outside US 2-3 months ago, simply long-term data make conclusions yet. Canada using extensively since late spring, vast majority people also got (and Pfizer-BNT) least 8-week interval. last part key, might also Public Health England become outlier study still showing high efficacy. unfortunate reality know true protection mRNA vaccines right now; time reason panic also reason avoid getting shot altogether. odds severe illness still close zero two doses. Geez that's crazy. know anyone died friend knows friend's grandfather died 2020 covid. 4 one week insane. scary true. cases rising quickly Israel good vaccination rate, it‚Äôs even scarier countries/areas low vaccination rates. don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs can‚Äôt apply critical thinking, think they‚Äôre fucking proud admit they‚Äôre wrong‚Ä¶. opinion worse.  got point one political party America spent decades building machine anti-intellectualism, they've lost control it. Yeah parents want go eat get back normal. them?? Think adults! People almost angry I'm terrified. instant ""LONG COVID"" retort random anecdotes cherry picked news stories outlier cases vaccinated person dying, almost people *want* anyone feel unafraid.

It‚Äôs 6 weeks (3 X ‚Äújust 2 weeks‚Äù experts) since POTUS insulted us. 
Down 60% day. 
Down 92% think response anything comment above? interesting thought. So, go 1-3:

1. Yes, breakthrough cases happening. vastly less likely require hospitalization, die, even get seriously sick vaccinated though. given overwhelming majority Covid cases even vaccines require hospitalization result death, fully vaccinated likely totally fine exposed Covid. 

2. area ongoing research appears least circumstances answer yes, masks returning areas. understanding unclear universal, symptomatic vaccinated people spread. someone knows answer would love see data.

3. Unvaccinated people much likely get sick die, sick individuals higher viral load thus likely spread it. Unvaccinated people likely danger broader community providing reservoirs virus mutate, especially larger clusters unvaccinated people virus circulating unchecked.

But also think American concept ""freedom"" become like runaway train brakes. placement individual ""freedom"" considerations - including well-being humans around one - one caustic, destructive forces modern American society, climate change already placed one foot proverbial door, surely lead collective demise. things world, balance interests individual interests society.

I'm glad somebody guts aim directly runaway train beat around bush. point, tried reason person, attempt rationality empathy manages placate them, they're wholly determined fight head-on, comes point accept challenge deal terms.  agree big issue, especially considering black hispanic people statistically serious consequences COVID variety reasons.

At least vaccination rates increasing groups higher rate last two weeks according KFF. South Korea, Vietnam, Mongolia Bhutan great job avoiding first two waves, case counts gone last six months. used believe non-island nations could pursue Covid Zero, longer do. Starting fall, minimum required amount days per month office (versus remote.) office, need provide proof vaccination. Effectively required Yep. I‚Äôm club lost member last year covid.

Mainly influenza hard vaccinated vaccines pretty low efficacy, still.

Another 2% process vaccinated, 2%   fuckhead, always fuckhead. zones, we'll concentrate camps.  KN95s 95% filtration efficiency performance, whereas KN90s 90% filtration efficiency performance. 

If going around known COVID positive person prolonged period (like healthcare workers), it‚Äôs important highest filtration possible minimize risk. 

For possible incidental contact general public (like going grocery store), absolutely think KN90s sufficient.

I know answer that, need appreciate creating school drop outs, exposing kids dangerous environments, creating significant damage emotional well intellectual level in-person schooling.

A large number children graduate significantly worsened life outcomes. generation high school drop outs end criminal records.

Fauci, top U.S. infectious disease expert, said Thursday federal health authorities ‚Äúlikely‚Äù call third shots boosters broader swath population point, though immediate need so.

In interview CBS program ‚ÄúThis Morning,‚Äù Dr. Fauci noted federal health authorities tracking various cohorts vaccinated people seen early signs shots may need shoring up. often case vaccines.

‚ÄúWe already starting see indications sectors diminution time‚Äù vaccines‚Äô durability, Dr. Fauci said. Dr. Fauci made points interview ABC‚Äôs ‚ÄúGood Morning America‚Äù Thursday.

Federal regulators expected authorize soon Thursday additional shots people weakened immune systems. interview last week, Dr. Fauci made point that, people weakened immune systems, ‚Äúgiving additional shot almost considered booster, it‚Äôs considered part original regimen been,‚Äù since need vaccine protected.

In contrast, boosters would used broader population counter diminution vaccines‚Äô protective power.

There immediate plans authorize boosters, Dr. Fauci said, federal authorities actively monitoring different groups signs waning protection.

‚ÄúWe following cohorts individuals, elderly, younger individuals, people nursing homes, determine fact level protection starting attenuate,‚Äù Dr. Fauci said. ‚ÄúAnd get certain level prepared give boosters‚Äù ‚Äî preferably, added, vaccine received earlier.

The debate booster shots grown urgent extremely contagious Delta variant runs rampant country, especially populations lower rates vaccination.

Countries like Britain, France, Germany Israel already announced plans provide third vaccine doses certain groups.

Global health authorities called booster shots questionable use insufficient supply vaccines much world inoculated, including front line health workers high-risk people.

Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director general World Health Organization, called last week moratorium boosters end September, countries would ideally enough doses vaccinate least 10 percent populations.

‚ÄúI understand concern governments protect people Delta variant,‚Äù Dr. Tedros said. ‚ÄúBut cannot ‚Äî ‚Äî accept countries already used global supply vaccines using even it, world‚Äôs vulnerable people remain unprotected.‚Äù

Oh wow hosting Olympics spectators great idea lol beach fine. Outside transmission low.

Indoor areas? Well FL biggest COVID hotspot US right now. tourist COVID cases excluded numbers worse appears. (And vaxx numbers include tourists number worse well).

So indoors crowded areas general public, would wear N95 socially distance. Anything less seems like excessive risk imuno-compromised person.

The average ICU capacity around Sunny Isles 85%. FL average 88% national average 65%. currently 6 ICU beds near shit hits fan. there's multi-car pile another gang shooting, someone wait get ICU bed. health professionals expect things get worse get better.

I'd say stay away strangers (stick beaches, pools etc), dont need ICU wear N95s, risk level may tolerable.

Honestly though, deserted state park might better option.

Not wanna hear I'm sure :( people holding vaccination bad white people so

They might nice people. might totally willing play act good cost them. 

But good. American Academy Pediatrics sent letter FDA urging approve vaccine data already available. Note FDA requiring six months post injection data kids opposed two months required adults. Key quote letter: 

 
""There biological plausibility serious adverse immunological inflammatory events occur two months Covid-19 vaccine administration""

 
I can‚Äôt seem find clear scientific justification FDA‚Äôs approach here. find article offered reason seems based (flawed opinion) belief data/faster full approval somehow lead great uptake vaccine finally approved:

 
‚ÄúThe FDA's rationale behind collecting safety data extended period time, according NBC, speed process getting vaccines fully approved kids 12. Collecting six months follow-up data would significant that's minimum length time drugmakers must monitor clinical trial participants adverse effects (like long-term side effects breakthrough infections) order receive full FDA approval vaccine. hope swiftly issuing full approval EUA would boost vaccination rates kids 12 making hesitant parents feel reassured vaccine safe children, FDA official said.‚Äù

  
Let‚Äôs leave bunch kids unvaccinated schools starting Delta spreading maybe vaccine hesitant parents come around faster pretty weak justification. FDA used two-month data requirement used adults would already vaccinating 12 year olds right now. many us would happily get 12 kids vaccinated today approved EUA. desire parents wait full authorization prevent others getting vaccinated. FDA failing horribly here. Antivax nothing facts. loyalty Trump.  worth: original goal vaccines begin with, always prevent severe/hospitalization, never anticipated would level efficacy symptomatic infections.  Lol, idea sign specifically referring to. imagined something political idea Obama's birthday. let them, Pfizer could Delta shot ready go tomorrow. issue change base pairs spike-protein vaccine need new approvals. Oh well. couple kids dying okay conservatives kids bringing home chances parents also getting it. I‚Äôm impressed district even tracker  I'm honestly sure mask wearing would prevent thiings going back ""normal"" otherwise (IE limited social distancing, large events/gatherings, schoools ect)

Delta real. 

Obviously, masks would help lot. schools example, got 30 kisd classroom. kids age 12 gonna keep masks time. Delta contangious, they'll get sick anyways.

- top ten leading cause death 2018
- Daily cases certainly thousands peak flu season Well problem one thing know Wall Street traders, it‚Äôs always thinking well-being people. Shit like make glad live US government would rather fight things like this... school selective enforcement. You‚Äôd see girls spaghetti straps shorts small basically underwear get away dress code violations. randomly girl outfit would forced change. remember seeing crush wearing body conn underwear nips clear day walk past two admins get yelled at. also see girl forced wear hoody Florida summer stomach showed crop top. 

Or freshman year banned Young Jeezy Snowman shirts ignored shirts bugs bunny smoking joint gun hand. 


During summer months school basically lose control girls outfits. far hot majority would shorts tank tops. many violations school handle otherwise everyone would sent home. think said many times issue isn‚Äôt supply, it‚Äôs willingness people get shot. Right vaccines thrown expiring. need take get shots arms, trash can. means getting boosters approved children follow, it. It‚Äôs better say gave shots ran throwing away shots people could using way. airflow. need take things outside, like early 1900s look ways improve ventilation/air refresh rate. know area, seen older schools higher ceilings/larger windows mentioned newer schools energy efficient/sealed. Serious answer: Sending #1 home negative test done weekend good enough. 

Non serious answer: send everyone home, long weekend! ‚ÄúCan‚Äù. probability asteroids directly hit one person. government shouldn‚Äôt safety net idiots. never meant way. People able drug oblivion applaud distance that‚Äôs want do. stupidity using narcan third time someone overdosing. want die bad give means. many kids sick enough need doctor. testing shit.  meaningless unless know concentrated vaccine Hahaha. Thanks laugh sad thread. ethical reasons, sending doses poorer countries vaccinate people highest risk. need first shots need third shots.

I agree principal, start breakthrough hospitalizations we're going crash medical system. Also, would include elderly (70+) immunocompromised front line. point become clear regulations prohibiting necessary public health protocols fact manslaughter? Also trying get sweet sweet naval hospital ship come park coast while. Mississippi leading way! OK. medical professional safety compliance officer would do.

1) 3 secretaries relevant personnel may also exposed wear masks indoors office Monday afternoon Monday tests come back, whichever sooner. Could sooner Monday information last time Secretary 1 saw granddaughter

2) Monday morning, 3 secretaries relevant staff get rapid COVID tests. tests negative, proceed whatever operations place exposure.

btw, know allowed business expense may able alleviate burden secretaries staff buying OTC COVID home covid tests take Monday rather go pharmacy. military, btw vaccine mandate, thankfully step that‚Äôs case. 

The walls closing anti-vaxxers, would rather resort violence take vaccine that‚Äôs best weapon dangerous highly contagious virus, free deal consequences. agree principle, reality majority eligible Americans left unvaccinated want it. campaign change minds protecting already made right decision protect themselves, especially people particularly at-risk. plenty supply simultaneously. government put PSA video beat COVID. would literally five seconds long. Put mask, take steps back, get jab arm bam, COVID over. fact can't that, we're back place last year, possibly even worse due Delta, unreal me.  agree honestly thread thoughts particular article comments, thank civilness Let's go Darwin elementary!!! know, right? don‚Äôt understand isn‚Äôt listed right top every ‚Äúlong term Covid effects‚Äù list. Prison, plain simple.

Charge: Child Endangerment, others. odds substantially favor, guarantee. want hear this, likely ""I COVID need vaccine,"" best possible protection infection + vaccination. think recommended wait 3 months, check doc. looks like infection recovery may actually provide tad protection vaccination, although studies saying less, infection + vaccination literally best possible protection. 

The thing think - also probably want hear - many people passed to. Again, looks recovery provides somewhere good protection, could still reinfected infect yet people. may well her. Mississippian here, Half 7th grade class brothers school quarantined, brothers grade sent home too. think numbers way higher MS reported. Nobody believes though, they're getting tested. get tested, take seriously go public maskless. Im genuinely surprised vaccination rates even high here. Danno probably Maika'i card found ground something. I'm due October too. husband fully vaccinated, 5 3 year olds not. 5 year old started person Kindergarten last week terrified bringing home. school claims contact trace anyone within 3 feet 15+ minutes, requires kids get tested first. trust parents community take kids get tested. glad pandemic. too. That's understandable. want left alone live natural immunity.

Sorry. topic inserting ‚Äúat‚Äù sentences doesn‚Äôt belong worst, common grammar error currently don‚Äôt think people realize harshly they‚Äôre judged using it. ACT day lockdown since April 2020. They've living life practically normal. They'll happy lockdown handful cases stamp out. Delta‚Äôs escape capabilities significant. some? Yes, nowhere near others like beta, even true escape variant.

If delta booster could magically appear pharmacies across country sure, it‚Äôs going hurt. fact original formula works well it, boost original formula brings exceedingly high levels delta. look moderna‚Äôs earnings call slide deck last week; basically say booster 50ug original, outside chance 100ug. It‚Äôs worth effort confusion money resources manufacture distribute delta booster. think people southern states willing others die Covid, like it‚Äôs become normalized there? idea offers still require one year experience? graduated December I‚Äôve done work covid ICU/vents since licensed. I‚Äôd love able actually make worth wage it. $21 hour shit going making lose mind. says specs fit-tested mask.

There's two columns N95s. One column fit tested masks assumption 1% leakage around edges. second column non fit tested masks assumption 10% leakage around edges. Even non fit tested leaky N95 5 TIMES BETTER surgical mask 7.5 TIMES BETTER cloth mask.

As source control, cloth mask 33% better (20 minutes vs 15) wearing nothing all. say walk eggshells. tactical verbiage advertising industry every day. Know audience. self-indulgent obnoxious real truths, accomplish absolutely nothing. never change minds, continuum people. convinced. would assume that? I‚Äôm merely putting words reaction story. is: ‚Äúthat‚Äôs scary‚Äù India going terrible wave pretty much work India teams stopped. transferred time critical projects make sure really business critical things still got finished. What‚Äôs like bizarro world? global climate change minor annoyance? Psoriasis ankles they! Right??! üòë know what‚Äôs detrimental kids going daytime prison camps public schools recently become?   Death. 

Death much, much detrimental.

Here‚Äôs idea: put kids remote. Now. Subsidize income every parent give work stay home kid. Fine every employer provide position said parent pandemic control, exact amount subsidization. Money initially comes ‚Äúdefense‚Äù budget. would done winter, next generation grow less future health issues (said health issues hundred fold economic cost future cost now) people lazy wearing masks that. People wearing sealed N95's, wearing shitty cloth masks surgical masks gaps faces. That's wear. Wearing mask enough say I'm wearing masks gaining little protection it. Unfortunately, far many people can't trusted make decisions and/or right decisions. That's problem. still remember state governor Bay State shut MBTA ordered people stay roads, huge, huge snowstorm several years ago. people disobeyed order stay roads, rescuers put lives risk rescue people. sickening. **exact** thing happened blizzard 1978 Massachusetts. hell wrong people?

Inability care others.  &amp; wonder accepted PA valid proof. clear JPG phone case.  shouldn‚Äôt big deal. virus doesn‚Äôt affect kids negatively parents plenty time get vaccine Hey, wife's Madison. first time I've ever seen mentioned Reddit... Heh, Charlie Baker Massachusetts would like word. data 14 days past first day Lolla continuing investigate cases COVID. unexpected findings point evidence point ‚Äúsuper-spreader‚Äù event substantial impact Chicago‚Äôs COVID-19 estimated 385k attendees Lolla, 90%+ (4 10,000) vaccinated attendees reported testing (16 10,000) unvaccinated attendees reported testing 8/11, hospitalizations deaths now, **there total 203 cases identified** attendance Lolla symptom onset (or asymptomatic, test date) attendance. 58 Chicago residents, 138 non-Chicago Illinois residents 7 state much super spreader event. read interesting article Forbes days ago suggested push vaccine mandates private business would much quicker successful fight delta. Even though federal government can‚Äôt mandate them, highly suggest put full weight support behind that. federal government stand behind recommendation makes easier business mandate without big fear legal consequences. Even without full approval put advice forward instead universal masking, much better chance beating quicker mask mandate do. mask mandates prolonging making vaccine hesitant people (not anti-vaxxers fence. Debating safety fast tracked vaccine vs way return normalcy) lean toward ‚Äúwhat point? won‚Äôt make difference. still mask up‚Äù completely mask mandate place. completely discourages might otherwise eventually get it. 

It‚Äôs interesting take find end game. Made think different perspective. 

Or could complete garbage approach Yay! Let‚Äôs give let assholes win! Oh boy...I Moderna first two...the third one going suck lol That's thought long cloth mask well fitting Ugh, end year bonus work tied sick days one job worked. less sick days took, money got. Fucking awful. clue tbh, brand Realy Tech, I‚Äôm assuming it‚Äôs N used type test immediately came back positive antibodies :/ got Moderna little early say think we're seeing delta surge looks like area 75% population vaccinated. would Russia. Dude trying. hard. Eh, crowds kinda suck though. follow him, really. every far-right party around globe looks handled pandemic head-in-the-sand-who-cares-if-people-die approach. 6 year old. distance learning last year heavily supplemented provided school. Last year eroded trust schools capable educating kids. I‚Äôll likely pull homeschooling future. damn shame school refuse support parents want take active role educating kids. requests syllabus could supplement materials related work going provided dismissed. It‚Äôs like teacher came lesson plan week used. Since Gov. Parson got COVID, mean lacks ""personal responsibility""?

Kinda sounds like ""poor judgment"". Knowingly!!!!! Gahhhhh!!!!!!!! FUCKING PREACH!

-Fellow Texan *require* it, employers like, ""Come on, Bob. kid legally required quarantine, team player. answer, know response noted HR file."" Yeah think first time kids spoke say wtf. lived Connecticut 1/2 hour away Sandy hook family friends killed one effected get it.  


These people never care though. trump elected, gave even slightest bit hope american conservatives (I lost lot hope Bush Jr still tiny bit). conservative literally kills children liberal would surprised... actually I'm pretty sure that's happened expected actually remember sure. Need higher level... start roaming streets trying commit genocide surprised. One thing makes immune system good balance; particular, able appropriately ramp slow down. 

In older people, slow-down side immune system diminished relative ramp-up side, making easier immune system get control. No. It‚Äôs new information, that‚Äôs all. long people realize it‚Äôs nothing new it‚Äôs nbd. Walking eggshells going make people change minds. Nothing going make people change minds side issue. accurate ones hospitals good good enough give peace mind.   Sure many kids die decisions,
But that‚Äôs sacrifice I‚Äôm willing make. one said getting Oval Office pretty. Damn. Meet teacher day didn‚Äôt on, teacher on. hope son okay!  thing spring first opened. decided continue fall. I‚Äôd venture whole lot IHS. doctors part uniformed service FDA CDC providing advice reservations. 

But doctors stationed within reservations part community, becoming trusted members community fight everyday disease ailments.

No different high uptake Navy Shipboard personnel embedded doctor, special forces operators sports med doctors, high rates vaccination due deep trust built years time taken discuss situation hand.

High speed, low drag. Already exists vaccinated California: applying mistrust situation moronic. terrible. make free instructions http://gofile.me/3RhcK/pnLU1QbjG. scam! Dumb Asshole Award Well goes early 20s horrible idea, even care lives anti-vaxxers. They're breeding ground new variants, something along lines matter time we're back step one vaccine-immune strain mutates. feel like we‚Äôre feeling next wave COVID Delta variant. like torrential downpour world vaccine like umbrella. might still get bit wet even umbrella, you‚Äôre going drenched without one.  Let‚Äôs forget kids already sick time. seems like we‚Äôre making taboo unwell all. kid gets Covid takes school, what‚Äôs difference compared flu norovirus pinkeye? absolutely still public health issue. Globally people vaccinated rates US. there's still plenty people can't vaccinated (immuno compromised, children 12). young kids relying everyone else, yes, still public health issue. Yes, we're making best choices protect them, still need go school. certain asshole governors think blocking mandates smart way go. insulting every healthcare worker called heroes months ago.

To consider global pandemic public health issue pretty ridiculous. fight people wearing masks taking basic precautions, yet are. taken seriously, politicized, remains public health issue that. need apologize, thanks clarifying. SF general masking part majority respect mask rules indoors outdoors well. wear masks (as claim vaccinated), minority. Social distancing respected areas, hard enforce outdoors. Hope helps. feel part, people know fully aware. Anyone else see know either minority talked town. personally still wear masks everywhere except house, I'm still paranoid; despite fact I'm fully vaccinated. I'm trying protect others around well. feel mentality among peers.   Vaccinations take weeks take full effect. Even adults got vaccinated right really make difference. earn close 6 figures insurance pocket costs lower Europe. places like work require mask, require N95s example. 1000% Vote recall make sure keep sensible covid measures Man, anti-vaccine / anti-mask people vocal opinions? It‚Äôs taking everything chime make cousin look stupid. Sandy Hook made difference. showed us importance protecting guns /s  Yeah, I‚Äôm getting booster shot unless completely immune resistant strain pops up. I‚Äôll like long term immunity cells jobs. Happened too. get kid tested fact since quarantine anyway. then, sick contagious, hunkered rested inside house. reason expose people exhaust myself. aggravating. Pretty facile reporting part NY Times ask me. What's next, stick figures sock puppets? model lot less sophisticated graphics: First unfortunately we're far cry 95% vaccinated. Secondly, model take account vaccine effectiveness [varies Unfortunately, making pretty optimistic assumptions.

My guess large percentage NY Times reader base already vaccinated preaching choir top everything else.  think kids sit silence open mouths put food it? That‚Äôs time social. 3 kids per table last year took energy keep spread out, keep eating, put mask finished, etc. easily well behaved students I‚Äôve ever worked - kids wanted talk friends. Ravi Gupta =/= 'authorities'. Exactly! think even strong mask usage would seen upward blip numbers due ability delta infect easier alpha. We'd probably shaved tip spike though. Lmfao wut .....

My point posting SCOTUS case show there's precedent this. Society agreed rules century now, tacitly agree rules continuing participate society. disagree rules, elect leaders change them, still expected follow happens.

The unvaccinated represent threat us act reservoir virus mutations occur. wrong mutation defeat vaccines long run, yes, unvaccinated affect us all. That's government right DUTY protect people health threat way would military threat.

Furthermore, children cannot currently vaccinated unvaxed represent huge threat well. think pf politicians it, least moment current health care facilities handle load. could change certain areas.
