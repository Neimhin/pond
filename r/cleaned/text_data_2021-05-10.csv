0,2021-05-10," mean keep storage allow enough ? cure prevention. used way better keeping storage. getting worse cases UK?   materials exactly? vaccine different technology ones. people's opinions way determine I'm good person not. declaring unilaterally height narcissism. Scientists demand peer review order claims taken seriously, different? availability?

I bet so. person walk local walmart today time get vaccinated free, appointment necessary. “countries locked hard didn’t better Swedes did.” 
“We’ve seen Asia too. . .”
“U.S. states . . . fared worse.” 
So far, statements sound like judgment opinions vs hard numbers researched. studies estimated basic reproduction number lower diseases like measles, chicken pox, mumps, rubella etc.

And that's mitigations like masks, distancing. think community spread lower. I'm around NYC reason, slightly comfortable last year September/October vs last month (I think mostly crowds smaller/easier spacing). Slowly getting comfortable, agree masks outdoors thing, spacing permits. Lol whatever dude me, wearing mask like wear shirt go anywhere humid, sweaty 100-degree day - minor annoyance worst. Even chances transmission outdoors like 1%, wearing mask non-issue whatever.  understand getting at, vast population vaccinate board mask wearing anyway. think lot people used busy vaccine centers excuse wait people needed could go first. there's excuse see neighbors turn zombies, easier stroll walk site get it. signed immediately able went way way get early. It’s 2 weeks since second dose phase 1. 

It right hasn’t possible many people want get it. June hopefully.

Edit: non-vaccinated still masking. I’m ok policy another month so. #bhaktgivingknowledge wanna cut feet broken glass, get dirt shit them? There's reason wear shoes.   believe already heard months ago. Biggest “duhh” ever. I'm librarian town massive retirement village. sweet little grandmas get really excited help learn use technology lol. presenting contest besides insistence prove science right? far provided two sources evidence you’ve provided zero contrary. research insight standing flimsy soapbox.

Unless next comment link verified peer reviewed study supporting ‘perspective’ I’m done here. That's really tragic me. Think people worked whole lives died got enjoy retirement. sobering sure. I'm grateful parents got vaccine covid. “I’m gonna keep masking.”

“We need keep masking.”

One acceptable. not. Highly unlikely, look 18-29 yo uptake rate, less 25%. realize many didn’t start eligible month ago, given easy get appointments right now, mid age group truly going “scramble” get vaccine, would expected higher. think 25% uptake 12-15 yo bracket would generous assumption vaccines prior logistics done. prefecture (state) thing without guidance notice central government. short, shit show. 35k death Wuhan? source saying 100k dead London? provide link plz. vaccines, American perspective collectivist decision-making processes slow folks held accountable deliverables. Also, I've found Japan ways averse proactive planning. sTaRtEd OnE cAsE lAsT yEaR That's simple impossible, considering 40+million people even officially counted census. I'm asking explain *scientifically* came conclusion. reviewed, probably many sources may looked at, came entirely different endpoint. 

I'm asking give personal opinion, I'm asking explain convinced data evidence point believe. Because, repeat myself, make sense draw conclusion masks powerfully effective. try avoid putting mask pocket always carry bag. usually put leave apartment, run errand, take I'm home. uncomfortable wearing chin vs wearing it. R0 doesn’t reflect thread talking about. 

R0 takes account average spread infectious individuals. doesn’t tell whether made 100% so-so spreaders, 50% spreaders 50% non-spreaders, 2% super-super spreaders. 

And fact change needed terms vaccine coverage (and measures control) stop it. 

It also complicates lot data say “X doesn’t spread it”, actually doesn’t spread it, scenarios studied didn’t happen end one super spreaders. Vaccines work! Contrary pushed daily one popular ""news"" channel America.

Get vaccinated normal summer America. easy free. absolute gift country! amazing tbh. Uk full lockdown discovered Uk variant.

How restrictions work exactly ? found safe place time ""outdoor wind"". 
There actually choice. ended like treatment prevention beginning. tools now, restrictions longer justified. Covid vaccine status flu shot.  OK, rephrase it?

*Lockdowns work unless remote island low case numbers handful entry points*

Better? you’re interested personal perspective science rationalized science doesn’t make sense? don’t give shit personal perspectives unless you’re expert infectious diseases.

I read science, thoughts. Thanks president trump operation warp speed developing vaccine record time I'm discussion investigated make sense. I'm asking clarify using critical reasoning. 

Again, evidence data showed masking worked, would loudest proponent it. interest discussion introspection, that's fine, maybe take edge beaming confidence reinforce things entirely understand. I'm genuinely trying say insult, disinfectant following everyone else doing. What's popular always right, what's right always popular. real question, I'm snarky:

Have officially determined vaccinated don't/can't spread? impression possible still asymptomatic spread, although likely much lesser degree.

My takeaway media made way apparent rather dig pages random Reddit comments google searches find information out. 

Had known certainly wouldn’t vaped hours getting 2nd shot. Fuck. initial comment removed mentioning two major parties equal disdain both. Here's comment without that: 

I’m talking people I’m talking you. 

Here’s chance defend logic behind masks. confident efficacy trivial. I’m willing listen, also perspective. That’s bad math, would actually total $300B (300Mil * 1000) $600B paid $1k dose everyone received 2.

Distributing cash much cheaper alternatives we’ve gone avoid it. It’s media’s fault good bad thing took covid vaccine vape THC? Think way - antibodies making response vaccine specific part slime protein called receptor binding domain. band suggests, part binds ACE2 receptor. changes much, can't bind ACE2 effectively. changes little, can't evade vaccine.

The danger comes mutates enough either bind completely different receptor finds series mutations allow bind ACE2 mutating prevalent sites immune system recognized. WTAF Yh I've read slow is. stock delivering vaccines speed  criticism China downvoted. ❤️ Yea, read 1% fully vaccinated? hell. Japan slow vaccination efforts? It’s guarantee. need stop comparing flu writing eradication creates self fulfilling prophecy - opinion trends direction likely people going consider worth get vaccinated therefore likely becomes endemic.

Swaying public opinion important towards something like this, reason become endemic unable properly sway public opinion right direction.

The data right indicates vaccines protect variants reduce transmission. nothing like flu way vaccines work could lead eradication, make comparison therefore leads likely end becoming endemic? CDC nuts this. think administration would want messaging optimistic encouraging. We've basically beaten thing almost far will. Rates going keep dropping. vaccinating elderly thoroughly, case fatality rate gets closer closer flu every week.

I dont think we're point drop indoor mask mandates unvaccinated, we're going end summer. Says online read November study people vaped less immunity post vaccine. 

Why media isn’t informing us don’t know.. fucking ridiculous really remarkable India well long. US definitely could done much better. Despite relatively better infrastructure, local area short 100% ICU usage. think vaccines one main reasons things gotten better area lot people around think masks distancing worth anyway. vaping vacccine? grape flavored now? people impacted pandemic covid?

In sixth day official positive test, start liiiiiitle bit smelling now. 2 day’s fever still running nose.
It takes way long vaccinate people Netherlands!

We 54 57 years old.... Cannot work right now. carefull, still happen everyone.

Hope everybody vaccinated asap!! Yes week May 3rd. Maybe. I'd still like see greater statistical analysis factors seasonality (we saw declining cases last May, too), mobility patterns (are getting significantly more?), number tests (how much community spread capturing?), course vaccinations. I'm quite optimistic vaccinations (I believe real, viable tool arsenal), I'm wondering see July spike like last year.

I assume it'll much milder severity, continue test like are, surprised see cases surge periodically. reason, necessarily want tie ""success"" case counts. measure success hospitalizations deaths. learn diabetes. Please add BREAKING headline

I'd say pretty scary heart attack, pass operation. going blind thru type 2 diabetes losing limbs. hey, choice right. anyone know get MRNA booster got J&amp;J vaccine originally? Would reduced effect? It’s like cigarettes bad ads. doesn’t know now? true. Israel United States currently main ""demo countries"" showing real-life effectiveness vaccines. listened science definitely would ban smoking, drinking, junk food. Pay employees  literally heard guy yesterday mention “the vaccines might kill us 30 years, don’t know” smoking... Thank part! Good thing since, far I’ve seen , Florida highest amount new cases 21 straight days hope become standard every state mean isn’t wrong. vaccine weariness black community open concern prior vaccine roll out.

If actually look demo graphics getting shot, falls pretty closely demographics country white people getting slightly black people getting below. Brookline? name melatonin cause booty good puts sleep after? looks like almost certainly possible eradicate disease. Confirmed infections multiple non-human animals mean even cleared every human case could still come back. (so far) failed program eradicate polio shown us limits even 99% effective vaccine.

It's going living us long haul, mutating forever, like diseases cause viral pneumonia. use water products! enough AstraZeneca note, EU find export records Halix plant might sent maybe million (or not). planned export AstraZeneca EU UK early output Halix plant, 20M, initially planned 2020Q3 delayed due scaling issues, EU blocked plant ready begin exporting UK early 2021. 

I'm sure UK Powers pissed planned millions doses blocked slowed vaccination timeframe 10 weeks. shortly whole India blood clots stuff happened UK used anyway. since cases deaths dropping cliff anyway could afford slowdown. 

The entire issue AstraZeneca supplying EU build capacity needed to, realised 2020Q3 yield projections 2/3 started building additional facilities within EU mitigate, essentially sat six months nothing could cause lose court. entire argument around UK facilities simply obfuscated real problem profound lack infrastructure. Maybe track 18+ separately, then, avoid artificial drop teenagers newly becoming eligible? pedantic point. Obviously everything paid somehow. article says ""free,"" obviously means ""free point use."" There's need clarify that.  working , minus Florida 21 straight days highest new amount COVID cases. Hey ready boycotts. last week. getting downvoted? reason would still need mask mandates everyone vaccinated? McDonald's good coffee /s affect foreign students likely get 'approved' vaccine? upvoted this, hurt pride good way. know lot younger friends slow boat, too.

Unfortunately, one got COVID last week waiting.  implying blip due fuck up, officially push back deliveries week (initially three EU demanded quicker turnaround). overdelivery way compensate delay though, end got vaccines counts leverage Szechuan sauce situation too? Get neckbeards? get bullied work people understand I've traumatized. mental breakdown thinking killing people I've begged wear masks around past (I returned work) think funny fuck me. Luckily vaccines, lower cases NJ, meds helping anxiety.  think companies little things like collectively make difference see.

Obviously dropping everything good sign considering reluctant we've opening back actually achievable goal! free talk couple million folks? :p Yeah honestly probably bad business move honestly really worry regions high vaccination takeup. areas South huge anti-vax sentiment coupled mask avoidance that's concerning. also want know live move there. God save neighbors. baited reddit rage. 100% worth. really downfall. sub seems two extremes pandemic yelling other. sometimes Fauci devil sometimes he's savior. yes studies showed large variance high 40% 80% 1st dose. Rule Acquisition #57: Good customers rare Latinum. Treasure them.

It's exactly good business let customers die, it... That’s looking positive effects kids going school, much helps working parents agree this. *only* way fully reopen Covid become endemic country get population vaccinated. US one first regard, I'm happy living here. get soreness. worst symptom waking sweaty feeling hungover Monday Friday shot. called sick feeling better afternoon. whole vaping thing happened mom constantly using CDC saying smoke get dad stop. tried explain CDC *always* says smoke, never change matter find janky vapes.

But reason CDC wrong comes Covid. state actually lower 40k cases yesterday 45 days. something cheer yeah. state hovered 60-70k cases month, things seem sizzle now. guess country I'm from. CDC mandate vaccine schedules -- recommend. states implement not. MS, WV, CA ban religious exemptions. push NY same. Yeah , nothing says mind health like Mcdonalds advertisement. Jesus. situation reversed nobody would helping us.

Other countries sent PPE, equipment, even staff pandemic  don’t really know - guess since it’s small country got big deliveries right start.... tax fraud finally pays off! ultimately comes protein structure drives interactions structures. mutations concern tend either bind ACE2 receptor better least partially evade existing antibodies.

By binding cells better, virus better chance starting infection fewer virus particles. sort like throwing ping ping balls fuzzy net. balls velcro likely stick. don’t think public health official going counsel distancing masks Covid cases drop zero. important remember people responsible measures staying place long people aren’t getting vaccinated. got vaccinated would already done. mean wrong. someone asked choose family random stranger higher risk vaccine I'd 100% always choose random stranger. That's what's ethical.

And exported like 10 million doses. Basically nothing took 16 hours It’s actually called food stamps theft. cups say ""If survive cheeseburger, please get shot"" Gerrymandering explain state consistently voting Republican presidents governors Really really dumb Americans nutshell:

I dont trust doctors government. know trust McDonald's... acceptable number dead 13 15 years old you? Even it’s one it’s many. 

I'm fully favor vaccinating everyone eligible, including young. Still, life works. acceptable number dead children. number low, zero.

 Life involves risk. wide variety choices make enhance lives time introduce slightly increased risk death. Imagine parent, chose build swimming pool backyard. so, increased risk child drowning. banned backyard swimming pools, fewer children would die. going ban backyard swimming pools, would insane. hundred children year die present tragic, ultimately acceptable loss.  don’t even want think number antivaxxers that’ll screaming minimum wage workers what’s printed cups. would prioritize vaccine makers six months ahead

Totally. need end export restrictions vaccines themselves. need prioritize works. Except recognizing airborne, one area overly cautious. don't, that's business. People vaccinated low enough risk able go lives. non-vaccinated people want go town high covid case rates, take chances deal consequences. CureVac advantage Pfizer/BioNTech Moderna stored refrigerators necessarily need freezers.

And also, export restrictions hurt CureVac, also already approved vaccines. Indian vaccine production seen severe impact export restrictions well, could argue India kinda needs vaccines right now. But, available? Yeah want kids back schools said 3ft good 6ft, suspect that's Biden CDC taken long recognize airborne.  I’ve lived 2 countries universal health care none things mention provided free, including vaccines (with covid vaccine exception) Easing exports

This would help Europe lot right now, Pfizer shots handled sensibly. tried crying internet? Omg remember videos freaking much. They're also hoarding raw materials needed manufacture vaccines regions.

Are we? thought bought up. McDonald's started giving free McDouble every single person got vaccine, bet lot ""I NEVER GET VACCINE"" people would start getting vaccine Spending people's money? GDP goes lot things, too. Tell country's gdp I'll math tell many vaccines buy.

They exporting astrazeneca vaccines. downfall Fauci sub been...interesting watch. vaccines already free US know life antivax convince would great also parents neighbors. 

Good luck! it'd great countries could get manufacturing going US.

Or even reciprocity. EU exported vaccines, would prudent start exporting them! Im angry people stupid think vaccines kind bad. 

I get clearly autism, def vaccines. think I’d stay away outright fines I’m definitely okay upping pressure leads people getting vaccinated. certainly don’t give two shits personal preferences people refusing simple thing good everyone around them. I’m saying people still actively getting vaccines (200k+ day California) there’s still lot people need vaccinated. California already given us end date, June 15th. gives people haven’t able get yet (you don’t know everyone’s circumstances, don’t hold yours) chance get reopen. still “we idea things open” deal, would 100% board sentiment there’s date people know “I get take risks”. good approach anyone doesn’t vaccine within next two weeks making decision protected date June 15th. it’s them. DPA actually amount restrictions? understand means manufacture particular things, export forbidden
 
The US legitimately hoarding vaccines (export restrictions) see what's wrong here. Yeah worn years cutting grass. don't, massive headache rest day.  exactly I’ve been. I’ve calling extreme boredom. It’s hard work there’s reward. Every day options work, housework, errands, tv, exercise. little social outlets. get drained boredom.   Someone start free beer shots campaign. isn’t free, you’re right, one choose vaccinating paying bill buying food. one worry health insurance insurance even cover it. government pays lots things taxes, healthcare? mean people sell meat that’s meat fries potatoes. wonder Sputnik’s decision move forward Sputnik Light project something problems Brazil discovered booster shot. Brazil’s authority found booster shot’s viral vector replicating threshold. 

It might good vaccine, whole project seems problem ridden, vaccines arms far. Anyone know Epi report released today? island “small” Australia population. Mcdonalds: America's trusted source healthcare information. big brained move sure. universe safer?

It's safer less spread. Heck, everybody 100% protected spreading course, vaccinated people, extremely rare circumstances, still get infected. serious complications already extremely remote possibility infinitesimally small.

With 95% efficacy, situation 20 unvaccinated people would catch symptomatic COVID, vaccinate instead 1 vaccinated person would.

For variants, vaccinations still work well less effective. example, California variant 75% efficacy mRNA vaccines. means situation 4 unvaccinated people would get symptomatic COVID, 1 would vaccinated.

But go situations would 20X (4X variants) likely catch COVID, could actually likely catch unvaccinated careful. Like, going bar vaccinated probably dangerous going bar without vaccination.

BUT, key point - community spread virus dropping vaccines. Pretty soon protected mere fact unlikely come contact virus matter do. THAT'S real protection. Sounds like priorities straight. Sounds like New England approaching herd immunity, rest country another story. Anyone wants vaccine doesn’t yet make appointment—or likely even walk in—at pharmacy near get shot today. case weeks everywhere country. I’m reaching vaccine-hesitant, meantime, risk don’t get shot.

Why fully-vaccinated people mandated wear masks? understand adding extra layer protection good idea—a breakthrough case still possible. you’re vaxxed, need great enough government force wear mask? dogecoin Nah totally agree you. There’s anything McDonalds really think regulated unfairly there’s plenty unhealthy stuff freezer section grocery stores well. It’s 100% persons fault becoming staying obese (evident there’s plenty people aren’t obese despite fast food everywhere)

Becoming staying obese 100% personal choice truly solved person themselves. guess say contributing mean food nutritionally kind garbage there’s always question chemicals used preservatives processing sort metabolic thyroid effect compared say whole/natural foods little preservatives. can't get difference. data available. First shot data available 5 days past. least directly CDC. saying many people, there’s much wait guess. wasn’t disagreeing all. Maybe overwhelming wrong word, point Trump received 5% votes among 50-64 65+-year-olds vaccinated populations seems like older Republicans getting vaccinated least. change position vaccinations hope get younger Republicans vaccinated well. convince might take lot effort. think antivax “Free McRib every shot” would knock *two.* Would it? 70% two doses comes weeks later. might've wanted mention case. really fucking idiot. Health leadership (Fauci etc,) advises people continue wearing masks vaccination science asymptomatic spread settled large swaths population remain unvaccinated.

You also moron thinks Reddit downvotes people can’t bare minor hardships months somehow scientific evidence I’m wrong.

Precautionary principle. Look up. can’t afford pandemic last much longer. afford wear masks mall September. intervention costs pennies might save trillions. wow amazing!! thank you! Hey that's bad idea. microdose mRNA shot espresso morning commute. on, I'm downloading gallons milk. saying people havent collapsed street anywhere pandemic, think lot early vids fake nothing covid.

Apparently 17.5 million undergraduate students US. colleges universities end requiring vaccines, going great help getting us closer herd immunity. Argentina finally getting AstraZeneca doses promised... time South African strain arrive.

Rats. tastes bad! eating Mickey Ds zero issues, think vaccines questionable stuff that's taking it, nothing inconsistent hypocritical. Waiting BoycottMcdonalds hashtag people whine daily cancel culture. Considering fast food helps contribute obesity

This opinion mine seems unpopular...but people contribute obesity epidemic. exactly want McDonald's they're already listing full calorie information next every single menu choice multiple places tell daily recommended calorie intake adult?

If can't stop knowingly ordering 3,000 calories worth food eating it, that's McD. Unless expect set limits much people order come kind like ""health passport"" allow overweight people order certain menu items...I'm sure else they're supposed do.

Also fully agree fast food something bought many lower income families, know what's actually even cheaper fast food? smaller order fast food. may replying business owner invested thousand dollars new camera system tracks customer movements business, like system rendered useless due masks.

Lots ""security cameras"" actually used analyze customer habits offer lots really useful analytics brick mortar businesses previously got online sales.  i.e. Men 30-45 tend spend X minutes isle 3 looking Y. Women 18-24 spend Z minutes looking J. Really useful stuff that's helpful business, worthless owners ban masks.

Political turmoil, barely, mostly around Olympics. 

The Olympics, yea, cancelled. clusterfuck sure. 

Again, really need vaccinations badly barely deaths. 7 day average death rate 80, country 130 million people. US 7 day death rate 650, adjusted Japanese population would 249 3x higher Japanese rate per capita. That's despite fact US 45% first dose 35% second dose vaccinated.

Japan ranked 130th terms deaths per capita, there's lot countries needed vaccines did. 

Their vaccination process ramping vaccines becoming available less hard-hit countries. 

Anyone complaining New Zealand barely vaccinated? No.. also need first. 70% one dose though, 2 doses would 'free normal' found guilty, was, send money birthday card! America latest data show mRNA vaccines 90% effective two weeks first dose. It’s still good idea get second dose, idea “two doses plus two weeks” overly-conservative. strictly speaking vaccine, hot? I’m seeing hearing countrymen beg freedoms taken think it’s justifiable anger nimrod Eyyyy I'm excited updates haha, *cannot wait* get booster shot. probably promote detrimental food body first.

Let's see feel shoe foot. idea countries like Canada approve distribute vaccine? like vaccine based traditional vaccines use inactivated viruses. I'd definitely peace mind getting Sinopharm CoronaVac. i'm unsure Canada ever approve it. Um, over. people know fully vaccinated, mean everyone else is. know quite people able get first second shot. Full immunity 2 weeks second shot. takes people even longer form antibodies.

There still people waiting get full protection vaccines. Saying ""over"" right little premature.

mRNA super unstable degrades really quickly (in matter hours). That’s Pfizer vaccine held low temperature, otherwise mRNA would degrade ineffective. short time window + lack ability enter nucleus really rules risk significant side effects outside allergic reactions. tell lie age, lol.

Ultimately much vaccine trial. Fifteen rough ride pandemic, pandemic dark times her. looks back say front line bringing vaccine market age group, opportunity wasn’t passive. I’m exceedingly proud her. seriously, asymptomatic study, made ridiculous amount money :) suffering.  missing point. Double blind, placebo controlled, one dosage increment (adult dose) used trial (but still two separate injections). trials younger kids use several dosages find best dose smaller sizes.

They looked antibody response (adolescents superior young adults) efficacy (18 cases placebo group zero vaccine group). 

There ongoing trial regular PCR antibody testing see vaccines also shown reduce asymptomatic disease, results arm yet. OMG. read thread. paranoia real. guys freaking like week data. Chilllllllllllllllllll Yet messiah (the former guy) secretly got vaccine available anyone. yeah. There's lot unpack there. First experience partisans sides systematically deny science. Political dogma inherently incompatible science logic. necessarily see anti-vax sentiment much result complete science denial specific conspiracy theory. 

At rate here's article found subject. clear talking general anti-vax sentiment. absolutely correlation political party COVID-19 Also personal experience seems weird ""macho"" thing Covid-19 vaccine. I've several men tell they're getting they're not, ""scared"" bad flu. makes less manly vaccinated. weird people getting vaccinated fear; civic virtue. feel bad what's going rest world - least even selfishly speaking, there's fire another house block, threat whole neighborhood.

But I'm actively choosing take solace find small joy news, sake mental wellbeing.

It's shit year. good see things go right direction...fingers crossed continues. school, internship 3 hrs away got jury duty notice. worst part month, every Sunday call in. didn’t care internship wasn’t town, even letter school stating time sensitive internship. wouldn’t delay jury duty done either. Every Sunday would call cross fingers didn’t go in. already trouble take week swine flu- internship drs office mostly old people couldn’t go in. Ended ER refused test us, school wouldn’t accept paperwork. mess. incidence rate drops maintains manageable level even everything opened like pandemic. It'll called endemic.   uhhhhhhhh..... first time I'm hearing people UK worrying cases rising look charts seems flat last two weeks. talking about?  knew trials. showed 70% efficacy total prevention 99% preventing serious infection would lead death. actually quite relieving see trial numbers reflected real world. really highlights important get vaccine considering shortages certain countries hording supplies resources. Even everyone got sinopharm vaccine could finally end pandemic. single documented Covid infection anywhere world casual outdoor interactions, walking past someone street eating nearby table.

Hot *DAYUM* NYT mic drop. Amazing Telegram allowed Independent not! 

This sub turning bizarre one. Exactly.

They literally sit millions unused doses people literally snub, time refusing export thus wreaking havoc vaccination campaigns around world. really getting ridiculous point also starting look like massive geopolitical blow. submission automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

US killing re: vaccinations; I'm incredibly impressed glad them. But, also, yeah, it'd great countries could get manufacturing going US. US friends who're getting second shots talking sites dead. Wonder states start throwing away vaccines expire. fair Florida lot issues involve tourists too. mandate vaccines forget pandemic existed within 40 days. 

Deaths 25 day point bet frustrating even manage get people willing get vaccinated done good. 

I co workers like people describe, vaccine available site, could get minute, it. strongest correlation vaccinated age. 65+ demographic job, younger age groups aren't. even much vaccine hesitancy vaccine indifference. Young people think virus issue apparently willing go get it. That's need bring high schools colleges well places adults congregate. get make easy enough and/or provide even small incentive. Hi guys ! delete previous comment due stupid governement restrictions. ! friends started service arrange Oxygen , beds resources patients across India. would mean lot could join discord server maybe even give us tips new discord. helped around 100 people across country.    Ya! Go ""about"" section . explains that. counties Illinois highest rates downstate. Sangamon, Champagne, McClean Monroe counties central southern Illinois top 10% counties fully vaccinated. basically rural counties lagging general populated counties carrying state toward vaccination goals. I'll spill secret: WV's full retirees nurses. vaccine 65+, WV jabbing everybody much faster that's larger portion population. looked great paper, always knew why. open younger crowd, crawl, hesitancy expect WV. sort change heart, median age state. Also, article:
"" early 2000s, bump beneficiaries likely tied Senior Citizens’ Freedom Work Act signed law April 2000, according Teresa Ghilarducci, economics professor New School Social Research New York. law reduced penalties beneficiaries continued work. monthly data show 300,000 people claiming Social Security May 2000."" also likely deaths early recorded something else. obviously happened throughout, common early on. Seems like thing basically done need drop masks entirely. Maybe another couple weeks really drop make sure think 4th July needs nation wide mask Independence Day. civilization ever stopped infighting lmao Next Marvel origin story. Depends state live in. SW Washington, adult get vaccine time want, free 5 minutes.

We blessed position. people thought reality possible virus first appeared . Quick question, legality getting vaccine without parental consent minor. I'm 15 live Texas would like get vaccinated mom ""medically professional"" let me. Look Israel. Masks still seen, they're nowhere near common were.

And outdoor masks still strange coming country one that. ive heard, black fungus may come poorly maintained health system, yknow, fair, kinda applies u.s., indias far worse us dubious thing spread like corona  idk call less dangerous possibility death still exists. Regardless statistical probability, chance there, danger fact OP posted article whilst showing 0 bias, reaction accuse opinion, question intelligence opinion give. listed germany, relatively dense country that's far better US.
You could also look Japan, arguably one denser countries world, twenty times worse per capita.  one actually spreading (in UK, least) doesn’t E484Q mutation either. lot lineages seem dropping E484Q. never seen someone describe Japanese bureaucracy well. Well done. 900k people dying Covid systems, necessarily Covid entirely, sounds right. gave far many people “push” wrong direction  don’t know strange. gym go to, younger people willing get vaccine would say 30 50. Much contagious either two mutants Yeah, wish Americans feeling hard rest world it. It’s difference “fully open” “fully back normalcy”. get many votes People working problem. Jobs refusing pay living wage problem. hope doesn’t schools nursing homes there?  wonder messaging would helpful getting younger crowd get vaccinated? Fauci shut up, tired propaganda Mr. Masks Needed Convince everyone know older 11 get vaccinated since would mean younger kids would safe. blood drives Walmarts, could work (they already vaccinations inside store, really need coupons) I’m 34 96 first Olympics remember, know used year, didn’t know switch recent. Canada far immigrants percentage residents...

You can't say ""we win"" largest developed country (by population) looking absolute numbers.

We use per capita comparisons reason. we're going use absolute numbers, US number one covid deaths world.

I guess best dying.  Hey least dont spend fortune paper bags anymore  wait 6 months vaccinate soon born vaccinate pretty much alien illnesses

ummm what? Yeah right though announcement seems like absolute worst case estimate. July far optimistic betting parlors taking bets would say August. Weird population totally onboard risking lives lives loved ones small number people extract enormous short term profit. Well, least holidays oh gawd bad October February. Covid isn’t severe enough disease justify forced vaccinations really seem way you? explain came conclusion.

So better person. I’m even capitalist, responses sound touch. don’t want family bloodline end you, fair enough World less people like you. 
If don’t think money help children better life hope children get lucky good teachers community support sure hell arent increasing odds success. Dude I’m obviously talking servers wearing restaurants. wonder message scared virus scared spreading virus. spoke college kid today said scared virus scared would pass unknowingly. like too. said thought would fine scared period knowing infected would know showing symptoms.  

Personally took vaccine everyone else. people can't take vaccine. people may access it. worry me, worry community. able get tested also dying home. pretty bad states last year summer winter. So? New Jersey well vaccinated Isreal. also produce vaccine still managed get ahead US. .. good point. think people (in west least) really temper expectations many people around going masking post-covid. 

I see people bring East Asia lot discussions wonder mask-wearing western countries prevalent there. there’s really important difference east Asia west former tends collectivistic culture latter tends individualistic. Research cultural psychology shows us people collectivistic cultures tend what’s called “interdependent self-construal”, say tend see member larger social group less individual person. People individualistic cultures independent self-construal, meaning see individuals rather member social group. 

What means context mask-wearing people East Asian countries likely okay wearing masks prevent spread diseases like flu cold people west. way saying don’t expect seasonal mask-wearing prevalent west pandemic, might see people wearing masks self-construal differences means dichotomous besides don’t see individualistic culture would ever okay masks collectivistic culture. 

I think saw SARS. know SARS wasn’t origin mask-wearing east Asia definitely made prevalent, Canada actually one worst-hit countries covid hadn’t seen anybody city west mask except Asian people. Canadians okay mask-wearing normalized context disease scare would already seen it, don’t expect western countries would differ much regard. 

TLDR: it’s normal asia doesn’t mean expect west. Depends type, astra zenica traditional vaccine much actually contains miniscule amount virus, point youre quite literally injecting virus, guess?

Pfizer different, probably turn zombie something. point think need economically sanction countries don’t serious policies. Hear that, Bolsorano Modi? Trade sanctions least help comes serious strings attached stupid. Makes sense. entire district won’t wearing masks next week. won’t social distancing wearing masks fall. cannot wait preteen vaccinated go back in-person learning least safe these... people... spreading disease. joke nothing say taken seriously Good points! Many things cultural.

There cultural tendency respect follow rules even absurd context. 

i.e. go ocean August despite weather. talk phone train, even 30 drunk people speaking top lungs... etc.

Vaccines rules: doctors give them!? Rationally, one would say need change rule make sure given many locations. Even means training previously unqualified people. Culturally: rule follow it.

Elderly pre-existing people come first: use email, cannot contacted? Well obviously maintain order, need people schedule appointments going house. may home, may answer door, people need go back again. time costly way things. fair protects rules.

When compared rule-flexible nations like US, 'it matters context', 'rules dummies', 'it ain't illegal unless get caught' mentalities, get massively slower rollouts.

**Hospitals certain amount beds:**

Japan: Deny service. rules say x beds z patients staff. 
USA: Put gift shop. Low quality care better quality care.

Both cultures benefits certain circumstances. emergencies, organized chaos better approach. third largest country world period, every developed nation much smaller.

This meaningless benchmark that. like saying winning 100m dash 80+ age category entrant. swimming Ganges, could possibly go wrong! started plateuaing

My brain blue screened reading that. seen numbers low things open are. states numbers last low, basically everything closed super.steict lockdown.right everything open, including large gatherings, hard tell fully open, honestly cases super low.

Summer + big lockdown last put numbers low. summer, spring + vaccine putting numbers low.

Don't discount differences. Pfizer tired trials found two small shots provided much better protection one massive (I think even larger one) shot. Even car accident? evidence that's disinformation? Yeah FDA rubber-stamp stuff like congress/house does, without reading stuff they're approving. Imagine insanity FDA approved stuf like patriot act covid stimulus bills handled 🤯🤣  Why? I’m college we’re planning almost everything like 2019 USA forum description state.  One thing learned years ago explained Japan better anything else this: height japan bubble, 10 years imminent ascendence 5th gen project Japan pushing narrative Japanese technology superiority, number one office automation technology use spend country photocopiers. point rest OECD fifteen+ years computerizing back office.

Sure, longer true (though history *why* true really interesting) provide great metaphor country works. can't find single reason downvoted. agree gave upvote. wrong people? keep seeing happen perfectly reasonable comments.

I started see well. reason subreddit gotten angry lately. feels like say precisely correct expected things, destroyed downvotes angry replies. Normally bodies cremated ashes spread river looks like villages unable unwilling cremate dead leading bodies floating rivers. Emergency authorization doesn’t speed testing speeds review testing report data. Instead team 10 20 scientists spending months looking data team several hundred look data two weeks. Also instead spending weeks schedule start data examination various meetings scheduling day two. people talk emergency authorization bad ignore fact mostly eliminates bureaucratic nonsense. also changed normal six month follow two months. Since seven month point Pfizer filed paperwork regular authorization. would support cat juries NYTime's chart Sept 20th lower day, 213.  I’m excited I’ll clear next week. Got second dose last week! fewer total reported cases lower overall positivity, indicates significantly fewer. Please stop spreading misinformation. Reported anti-science anti-data. got called once, said sure problem long could bring 4 month old breast feed baby. happily declined attendance. really want play bull shit puns everyone would probably cow instead. Love everyone, stay safe hope vaccines available across world soon. Thanks taking time respond. guess still see able completely open kids get opportunity get vaccinated. 

A) True, make sense lockdown chance happens? flu could mutate become significantly worse, never cared that.

B) True, efficacy rate pretty darn high, no? odds someone getting sick, even hospitalized pretty low. Low enough accept risk?

C) see point there. long suggest would wait herd immunity group? 

I looking start argument, go much conversation, genuinely appreciate taking time explain logic, even agree solution. We’ve hard lockdown too. help still 2 younger this. Hopefully they’ll able get September like they’re predicting. still help though we’re happy it. Congrats holding keeping family safe. *raises hand quietly* lmao Where? US.  Ugh please requirements already? want anything outside home, get vaccinated want A) thinking small (9/11 claims)

B) replying someone interests distracting OP. want much anybody. Endure work together could lot better state school returns. state many deaths October last year March-September combined. either learn history doomed repeat it. Come people, work together greater good. Wow it’s honor speak one 1 1,000,000 people severe reaction vaccines according CDC WHO. much fucking worse. Same. would never allow vaccine FDA approved panel school children. Maybe couple years. Honestly gives af hardly relevant news Ngl seem like asshole berates anyone dares question headline fear mongering? know &amp; known basically since start countries don’t Covid cases control global health risk. reclassifying strain ‘of concern note’ due higher normal transmissibility rates spreads around planet. wouldn’t say there’s anything article says panic; urging ppl act practical &amp; safe pandemic.  already operating fast tracked timeline. FDA one conservative scientific bodies, frustration pharma companies. recommendations massive far reaching implications. See vioxx. need careful, are. Amazing it? need time review data meeting, probably massive complex document. sit around reading report meeting. work Walgreens flooded calls today. Give days states recognize corporate give us OK. People freaking couldn’t even answer calls work patients person. We’re staffed 200% norm currently also(6 techs 4 pharmacists one giving vaccines) Pfizer vaccine. dose 30mcg. got 180mcg. big deal. Moderna gives 100mcg per dose. Spring? friend thought extrovert discovered introvert. COVID never stood chance  Axis NoVaxxis. major stores require paper signs everywhere practice nobody actually enforcing past asking unmasked people door want disposable one. 

So places mask required policy like half people actually masked I've also heard entering everyone receives vaccine lottery, 300 $1,000,000 jackpots. cost come $300 million, \~$1 per person, assuming everyone's vaccinated want live world GDP trumps all, including personal freedom, human interaction include facial expression.  different group people different focus, even CDC employees. They're experts, usually directors hospital departments programs. 

Rather answering question, ""Do approve EUA age group"", committee focuses developing recommendation implementation vaccine immunization practices &amp; immunization schedules. includes questions like ""Who get vaccine first?"". also emphasis pediatrics, given vaccines get we're young, specifically look safety metrics &amp; efficacy different ages. also meet possible concerns arise, like deaths associated J&amp;J vaccine.

It's bureaucratic, also necessary checks &amp; systems place protect patients. They're meeting 12th regarding this, iirc. overly. Japanese remained authoritarian subservient leaders codes honor; it’s they’ve renounced wars imperialism part. live alone 30-something single gal. It’s bizarre experience I’ve definitely netted positive. ended getting know spending quite bit (outside) time many people neighborhood/community. Pre-pandemic knew neighbors either side it. I’ve lived area 9 years literally knew nobody else. entire network friends live within mile two me. bunch people want make world better place, starting proverbial backyard. 

It helped going pandemy, already independent resourceful resilient, well-versed “crazy life circumstances outside control” type stuff. rolled tried make best it. Depends are. Apparently they're opening ton slots, go day time people working pick from. sister got one 8:50 10 days out, several slots available various weekdays 8 -10 around 2 pm. miss 3 hours, get hours paid get vaccine. Future bubble boy sighted We'll places, maybe variant showdown.
Its either vaccinating people everywhere asap. wrong it’s even funny      I'm happy pretty much seeing inverse happened 2020 around time year. Seasonal want that, sure. don’t think anyone much luck Getting large numbers mask season. Well least get gorgeous trip Hawaii. Actually might still worth home two week lockdown. people said ""it personal choice wear mask"" really mean that. meant ""no one wear masks."" Right post elections, post teachers death ,this government bureaucracy fault,but make post relegion , post all, stop propaganda. Want BJP loose given guys enough , stop creating narrative create religious drift here.  40k people spread 70 years (ages 16-85) original trial, equals around 500 people per year age, equals around 2000 people ages 12-15. 🤷‍♀️ Gaaahhh. Stuff like guts me. makes blood boil covidiots. Fuck Jokes aside literally that!

You’ll fine. ?  haven’t gotten yet? Government get creative fun nation wide raffle. Everyone gets fully vaccinated heard immunity gets entered raffle drawing. Prizes include: 

-A permanent pass federal income taxes (if make certain amount) 

-A lifetime exemption jury duty 

-Your kids exempt registered draft

-A grand prize stimulus check worth millions 

-A meeting President Biden 

-Biden name drops next State Union address worried family vaccine yet. reckless spread eventually hit close home suffer people absolutely cannot stop partying also refusing wear piece fabric faces. I've done couple times interesting, I'd rather normal week. whole six feet away mask mandate great keeping creepers away. hope staying away strangers becomes norm like it. That's really interesting 14 days past 2nd poke wearing mask pure theater. honest reason vaccinated people told continue wear masks difficult enforce masks required unvaccinated policy. Way go brother ! read would take whole slew mutations (not double/triple mutants media hypes up) make vaccine-resistant variant, point would almost unrecognisable original. That’s something ask doctor Make watch Gen Z hospital punishment agree get vaccine won’t wear mask appropriate future, regardless state pandemic? don’t think it’s reasonable wear mask you’re sick cold flu? currently worst hit spot look Canada US combined

Only total cases metric. Alberta currently death rate 7 day average 3. number Michigan 70. Michigan twice population, that's still huge difference. 

The idea Canadian province country federally badly compared America farce. Poor Japan. slow testing n also vaccination. infected bodies wild, worry severe plague. incremental first shot harder last one relates hesitancy.  would 100% absolutely positively

The concept diminishing returns comes play though. point, enough at-risk people would vaccinated threat hospitals would eliminated. won’t worry them. They’ll get immunity one way another die trying  Darnit, missed black oil shot year.

I guess I'll get neck-chip... think? forget causes people die dramatically X-Files. Multiple scary variants already emerged, none stood vaccines.

I find hard believe new variant show start killing vaccinated people left right. imagine that, like last 14 months, restrictions many places predicated hospital systems vulnerable institutions handle. 

That said, places open risky ways, places take lot precaution. 

Herd immunity states looks like it’s probably going happen current rate unless something changes. We’ll open up, outbreaks happen, places outbreaks suffer sad consequences sporadic lockdowns quarantines couple decades. shut state borders (which unprecedented far I'm aware).

Almost unprecedented - State borders last closed Spanish Flu. guess im part 25%. mental health improved dramatically. Multiple scary variants already emerged, none stood vaccines.

I find hard believe new variant show start killing vaccinated people left right. mean take failing company, blame new owner slow, shitty start gets company back running? look president look numbers. hard see works whos sane office.  Um, thanks? Please put masterpiece music. Yes. people get people around get it. there’s sizable enough portion population that’s defiantly getting impeding progress potentially setting us step back. Fair enough FDA, CDC doing? Theres reason privy information. Please explain cancel Feels like India becoming incubator stronger version virus. Best luck. vaccine amazing. UK nobody died covid yesterday least six cases fully vaccinated caught covid hospitals contact airports, symptomatic. concerning.

Is really? Vaccines supposed stop virus, they're also supposed stop severe illness death. see what's big deal vaccinated folks ""symptomatic."" would start worrying fully vaccinated person two dies covid.  currently, it’s FDA Emergency Use Authorization. receives full approval states allow minor consent medical care able so. require regular testing, limits long athletes stay country, athletes allowed leave olympic village trainings competitions spectators. lot athletes vaccinted anyway. like Japan IOC arn't anything avoid superspreader event. I'm probably gonna keep mask handy airplane riding public transport flu season. Otherwise no. That's plus breakthrough might occur cause mild illness rather severe. hope stays way. lot people world yet vaccinated. like hundreds millions people rely river drinking water... Yeah, right mask creep lot people worried about. keep masking covid closer over, accept kind new facet life. Germs exist. kids 12-15? kids 16-18? months late everything Babies can't even get flu shot 6 months old think they'd follow route covid vaccine. That's mothers told get flu vaccine pregnancy. way, baby least get protection mom. goes covid since reports show babies born antibodies mom vaccinated pregnancy.  cannot know big wave open up.

Not big, considering 70%+ population vaccinated hypothetical scenario. Yes, border closure may popular 0% population vaccinated, would continue popular number higher 70%? I'm clear saying me. I'm asking long think it'll take EUA. None vaccines full FDA approval yet, aware this. far, EUA. Pfizer working application FDA approval adults. confirm, NZ, I'm low priority vaccine mind waiting seeing happens. Also, partners parents live sorta rural looking forward better 5G get vaccine... /s 


The difference life right closed borders, planning international travel year last I'm going daily life.  


Happy travel bubble Aussie though, get see brothers/nephew/niece soon! We're quickly heading towards situation herd immunity achieved populations US others. kinda agree interpretations time would good indeed holds true. I'm glad experts vigilant though. find comforting worrisome concerned watching. wrong people like ? Schools letting meaning primary unvaccinated demographic disperses. Memorial Day weekend seems like fitting end ""phase"" pandemic, could also see waiting week precisely avoid type effectively celebration. else accepted risk.

Except 12 parents say shootable. choice. NZ also give vaccine emergency approval, put standard testing regimen position able make choice. Many countries simply luxury give emergency approval hundreds/thousands infected dying daily, weigh potential vaccine causing adverse affects versus real death toll looking without vaccine. 


NZ also get vaccine like...Feb March. roll-out indeed slow.  year least. tried compare Sweden Europe say can't compare Sweden neighbors. GTFO

Learn read comprehension, take advice.

I even know point trying make link, positive address mine. Final outcomes matter, short-term spikes dips due (possibly) policy changes. 7 12 different ages bro Sure. chance dying testing positive small % deaths good silly think things would normal hospitals filling 3x people dying did.

Except that, know, there's real evidence that. 3x many people per capita die FL compared CA? must missed that.

If saying voluntary changes part population prevented happening - point lockdowns first people would stayed home, closed shop, etc regardless Govt did. can’t pretend without lockdown would normal year.

Numerous places maintained relative normalcy, without lockdowns, worse places implemented first sign trouble. work ICU nurse. know people may get covid vaccine, know that, 100 percent effective know people didnt complete 2 week cycle afterwards might get to.

But using annectodotal evidence claim science? Seriously? wont get vaccine. Ok why? think effect prevention, really shine comes preventing serious illness death. 

Anyone expecting us free covid we've reached herd immunity kidding themselves. could realistically situation we're deaths virus week. Yes that's also huge bonus!! Haha wear mine sunscreen benefits Even without ban, materials would reserved Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca, J&amp;J lines months ago. Knowing industry indirectly, crazy shortage moment, even materials blocked US bans. Makes realize nice eyes people Yea, shit. Taipei, May 11 (CNA) Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) Tuesday announced ban large-scale gatherings tightened COVID-19 prevention measures contain spread coronavirus amid increase domestically transmitted cases recent weeks.
Seven domestic cases reported Tuesday, source six unknown, leading tighter measures.

The CECC asked organizers halt large-scale indoor outdoor events — 100 500 people, respectively — June 8.
Business venues also asked start monitoring customer flows maintain social distancing avoid crowding.

A ban eating drinking trains also imposed June 8 reduce potential transmission COVID-19, including trains run Taiwan Railways Administration (TRA) Taiwan High Speed Rail Corp., well highway buses, ferries, domestic flights.

The high speed rail offer reserved tickets suspend sale non-reserved tickets, allow travelers stand seats available sit unoccupied seats non-reserved carriages.

The TRA also suspend sale standing-only tickets. suspensions THRSC TRA non-reserved tickets begin May 15.
Meanwhile, next four weeks, visits hospitalized patients long-term care facilities around Taiwan allowed, exceptions.

One full-time caregiver per hospital patient still allowed, CECC said.

The latest measures come group infections arose involving Novotel airport hotel Taoyuan one Taiwan's main airlines, leading 35 infections, 21 confirmed present domestically transmitted.

On Tuesday, another seven domestic cases reported, one traced Novotel/China Airlines group, six unknown sources.

(By Joseph Yeh) Canada worst worlds common theme. glad went States get Pfizer shots. We're going play whack-a-variant groundhog day scenario whole world vaccinated. people get virus leads mutations likelihood lead strain eventually make current vaccines useless. really hope point pretending everything fine gonna help anybody.  interest prevents Canada thing? something constitution/legal system prevents this? ask like commonwealth nations stage past Canada absolute parliamentary sovereignty. point best thing increase output current vaccination sites. global supply materials equipment backlogs many months removing IP protection allowing export materials equipment change little short term. agree that. UK stats different almost every country? countries covid deaths exceeds excess deaths. tried compare Sweden Europe say can't compare Sweden neighbors. GTFO

Also, look Florida June 2020, tell  governments europe banning burkas logic wearing face masks illegal well Weekly testing sounds excessive point. masks itchy &amp; scratchy, IMO probably awful getting pipe cleaner shoved nasal cavity weekly. ask children age basically asymptomatic need vaccine ?

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Uk one countries covid deaths excess deaths. makes UK different countries?   thought vaccines general always need prevent disease, worst outcome.  Japanese people different physically, Japanese bodies unique work way Western bodies races etc.. Hence vaccines work Japanese something etc etc... That's alot Japan actually thinks. idea Japanese people somehow inherently separate uniquely different, separate species rest humanity etc widespread common belief Japan, explains partly vaccination rates ridiculously low. EU indulging favorite pastime America-bashing. America turn PR, usual.

Release export restrictions release patents. I’m US wasn’t random. random drives everybody know sign least 30 minute time slot designated place. mass vaccination sites could show small minority. last ditch effort get people Legitimate question. Given awful been...  Rather silly think things would normal hospitals filling 3x people dying did. anti-lockdown crowd really undervalues voluntary nature lockdown measures. Many people would stayed home, closed shop, etc regardless Govt did. can’t pretend without lockdown would normal year. Seattle 99% outdoors, 1% homeless. college daughter summoned jury duty exact week home state Idaho also Massachusetts going school. odds? Would accept paper code people would take someone else's. could compare excess deaths vs covid deaths. However, excess deaths would include people may died caused indirectly covid enough hospital beds proper care, people scared seek medical attention ""minor"" things get worse, suicides countries, etc. 

It seems like there's million variables impossible get full picture. almost cherry pick data show want say. San Francisco Boston nations biotech hubs. people work pharmaceuticals, vaccines, virology, etc. understand risks. Similarities Sweden neighbours significant. similar culture allows social distancing. large numbers small households. population consentrated cities. Sweden twice population neighbours. Norway Finland similar population distribution less 1/10 deaths cases Sweden. Denmark much higher population density still 1/5 deaths Sweden. matter twist it, Sweden failed.

If country litterally middle ""outlier"" countries, can't get results, makes real outlier. Welp. Pretty strong evidence current vaccines gonna cut it. Absolute heartbreaker. flu bro got second Pfizer last weekend wasn’t bad all, tired day after. Definitely worth True, probably misjudged based controversial bumper stickers biker outfit. I'm sure helpful informative. I'm Victoria. I've already registered, recieved text email regards booking appointment yet. I've got lots time weekdays moment, changing long weekend.

I'm getting pretty excited get first dose though, ngl.  Based what? Nationwide vaccine stimulus incentive, let’s go, I’m surprised nobody brought Washington yet. Go get shot got already, get check. It’s easy track since everybody gets shot logged, card keep. Quite amazing pretty much every country is. No. cold flu home, belong. one recognize I’ve gotten angrier. see society reacted asked help fellow man continue see now, makes furious. definitely account mental health impact. sounds like guy letting know policy.... someone trying prevent want? Hopefully, EMA follow, get done school year August/September, it’ll make big difference. I'm say got stupid pfizer shots, 3rd one rolls around ain't freaking taking it. wrist hurt bad since 2nd one 1st one gave tonsillitis made wisdom teeth perfectly jammed coming out, come gums super swollen worst thing ever ):&lt; shots ever get know real numbers? I'll 100% use mask I'm sick can't stay home. Unsure otherwise currently, masks help keep face warm winter... ""Experts Twitter"" LOL  Detroit interesting variant this. They're paying $50 per shot -- person brings someone vaccination, one getting shot. $150 per carload.  opposed what? see science?

Do understand statistics? understand mRNA is? getting information? 

The vaccine isnt killing people. experiment? mRNA vaccine like showing body blueprint, says hey thing looks like watch it. would rather experiment getting virus? Can't really fault people end continuing mask receiving one dose fully vaccinated yet big city.

If anything small gesture courtesy. 1/3. Vaccination hesitation ends really low. Again, understanding forecast modelling works. model NYT linked poll, model. trying estimate many people vote candidate, trying interpret inherent uncertainty polling probability. different things. accurate model little accurate underlying data there's tons different ways interpreting data reach different predictions.

If going completely cast polling valuable data 2% difference 2016 that's understanding works.

Here little piece paper that's pass need get certain venues. picture called QR code, like barcode, scan it. lose let know we'll make new one. Every single one kid's friends vaccinated (half 16) ones working grocery stores, chain pharmacies, Target, Costco. soon private pharmacies started getting doses, 16s started getting it. Well I’m reading Reddit people’s lymph nodes neck shoulder area people saying it’s 2 months hasn’t gone away.. 

I know it’s everyone’s experience (including family) mine it’s incredibly frustrating right able breathe whatsoever 5 hours trying sleep. What’s wild states sitting difference 70 million doses delivered/administered still openly exporting countries. school runs vaccine clinic may able get mean, post something genuine, desperately trying shake people say, “If fiercely believe this, defend it, explain science me.” 

And get mindless responses. truth obvious, I’m idiot getting it, explain it. Discuss it. Debate it.  never understood people seem want involved peoples choices choices impact whatsoever. 

If someone wears mask (a legitimate mask) protects way. give shit? care color shirt wear type shoes wore today?

The problem opposite. People stirred loudest mouths somehow demonize them. It’s absurd. learned it’s productive call people names shame them, hope people general always remember think themselves. 

It’s easy us manipulated anything framed “Us vs. Them” matter side fall on. course throughout pandemic people insisted easy stay home people better circumstances naturally introverted grandma loses wallet, bank cards, passport, ID, car keys? 

Seriously man? draw line? think years pandemic probably estimation much closer reality official numbers get. 

Now already know 35k deaths Wuhan around started. r/thathappened Well mean understand cut socializing past year. we're getting vaccinated, I'm ready get back hope right.
The alternative great. chilling think about. r0 say 10 15 would surely meant countries wouldn’t able provide health care. Canada same. Let’s hope works us too.  people Facebook got straight C's high school

If even graded high.  best???? country prisoners anywhere else world, would think criticisms fighting freedom wouldn’t carelessly disparaged. 

If masks work, would happily wear one. would encourage friends family wear one. Even probably hundred requests genuine discussion masks site, still haven’t gotten it. 

Even now, led evidence remain open minded, overwhelming review hard facts either inconclusive wash masking nothing. It’s obvious much strongly correlated compliance endless fear anything else. Exactly, one forcing anyone socialize literally forced us year stop socializing year best year I've ever experienced seasonal allergies surprised mask why. next spring I'll probably wear mine again. go certain stores usually see people know want chat... You’ll back normal 48 hours. It’s also media’s job prepare someone side effects vaccine. people arn’t downvoting anti-vaxx views. they’re downvoting OP hypochondriac can’t weigh risk five states highest percentage adults least one dose Vermont, Massachusetts, Hawaii, Connecticut New Hampshire.

Ok I’m awful time vaccine. Haven’t slept night neck shoulder killing 2 days post shot. say media awful job preparing bad is.. countries definitely done better job counting others countries yoi listed probably better job. say totally accurate compare excess deaths covid deaths. Yes gives us good measure people died covid would died anyway fr something else people necessarily regarded excess deaths. mention flu deaths disappeared pretty much alot countries due social distancing, mask wearing incrrase flu vaccines etc. take away usual number flu deaths away. can't necessarily say countries overcounted 25% That's good point. want keep hiding inside rest lives, certainly need understand rest us ready go back normal Becaus COVID airborne, it’s unlikely that’s effective. cough hand, sure, it’s good idea.

There deeper problems mask-wearing. also mean countries start vaccinate younger kids well? Thought countries wait USA approval administering (like Israel) I'm still hoping 14 year old jabbed Friday. weekend recover tnag way case side effects. can’t think would coronavirus infectious viruses. lived Louisiana two years. make entire state line up. viruses eliminated reasonable vaccination program? R0 wild type covid may high something like measles 4x higher flu variants twice infectious wild type. virus going away without fast,overwhelming, near complete worldwide vax program. That's happening anytime soon probably never will. Thats even taking account inevitable variation lead vaccines always playing catch up.Can blunt deaths hospitalizations? Possibly,but virus stay, barring universal coronavirus vaccine. pastime, moral imperative. little data, yet try make convincing arguments it.

Oh yeah, that’s surprising. 1m KR it’s % rate CA income amount. 25% sales tax though… Long term side effect: healthy life can't think many emergencies bigger disease outbreak killing 3 million people 18 months. “Our family doesn’t eat McDonald’s anymore” Fine EU. good poorer countries.

OP's article drops ""supply distribution"" title (major omissions makes Brasil seem like wanna player vaccine production something that's almost certainly reach) mentions distribution body. Everything else ""Bolsonaro bad"" woke propaganda. Garbage. Getting first Pfizer shot 5:15pm! sub helped find appointment.  ....that exactly saying? sure coming like that. true! work vet hospital needle use microchip pets MASSIVE 😱 Oh, can't used ""track"" pets run away either, contrary popular belief (or maybe one though lol) got shot last Tuesday

Next shot 3 months away. understanding poor families sometimes (dumped bodies river). Ganges considered sacred that’s weird sounds. 

What’s different scale. True. Nobody helped us last year slammed Covid. Except South Korea sent us masks. course consider *necessarily* happen, saw estimates already mRNA vaccines mid-70s effectiveness B.1.351. Thankfully B.1.351 seem extra contagious. Given data points have, I'd probably put even-money bet (maybe higher, given size epidemic India) get another that-sized mutation terms immune response next year.

So Pfizer, would ABSOLUTELY preparing variant-specific booster.

Which, incidentally, article aside, they're doing. 

Which problem wording article (which, far tell, comes Pfizer, albeit financial, technical, side). article even accurately describe Pfizer doing. Yeah, like getting fat able eat again. Malta 60% currently. actually rather interesting case since vaccines supposed distributed proportionally EU Malta ordered vaccines outside EU deal. sure managed achieve that. waiting period make sure you’re allergic vaccine. wasn’t allergic first time, won’t second time. It’s like worrying you’ve somehow become allergic peanuts since last time ate PB&amp;J. get vaccines going like countries (UK, US, Europe) haven’t “beaten” anything, delaying inevitable outbreak. Europe Canada example demonstrated, avoid covid long. Like what, gonna keep borders closed forever? Covid going eradicated entirely Well, teens still get pregnant even though told sex. what's solution? Vaccination rate clearly correlated voting trends. different question really seen lot studies controlling factors. Good! national daycare chains/franchises regarding workers close contact children every single day. Youhadusinthefirsthalfnotgonnalie.jpg UK publish research June July mixing AZ mRNA based shots. unlikely you’ll see hard evidence sooner that. True, haha! \*are\* working kids working local McD's make personal mission pile much ice cream little cones possible. kids get cones size heads! haha! Bad car upholstery, love it! matter. effective covid vaccine require freezer. think might convinced someone get vaccinated. concerned side effects. told big deal might even side effects. 20 something year old likelihood getting permanent organ damage covid less one percent. serious question - seems quite correlation Republican voting states low vaccine demand. non American - result politicization pandemic?

Maybe maybe not. lot correlations think labeling anything direct cause going challenging aware studies tried control factors.

In 2020 US one strongest political divides college educated voters non college educated voters since polling began college educated voters much likely vote Democratic non college educated voters much likely vote Republican. (I want clear I'm saying college education proxy factor like intelligence income literally anything else). vaccine rates voting habits correlated education. mean education caused also go far assume politicization Covid caused either. Correlation equal causation think good chance factors motivated person vote one way another may also motivated get vaccine not. correlations likely strong purely coincidental would hesitant assume causal either without proof. Wow. That’s awesome. Thanks Thanks! Even family dies covid inability control pandemic supreme leader, would still support bjp. pathetic GQP already boycotted Coke-a-Cola. going boycott McDonald's too? Also, Japan's first AZ vaccine came America, EU, latter's export ban lasted couple months since January. Whenever get shot arm hurts like day..why shots hurting longer? Thank you! excited! we’ll fully vaxxed household! can't tell happy makes me. I'm German Omfg people fucking stupid... anti vaxxers believe big companies gonna put microchips whatever inside vaccines right? really think fucking people gonna convinced one biggest companies world? This'll make worse... I'd check insurance company, know someone Medicaid covered CVS go different place (I believe Walgreens covered plan). Based linked seems like place go free. Man one see sarcasm..whatever Yes.

It's like family, love them. 2-3 weeks would great. get second dose Friday, 2 weeks birthday, drop around time would honestly best birthday present Damn America pathetic lmao It’s funny states complained shutting business good economy. thing threatening economy risk many unvaccinated people silent kind point. know exactly Indian variant transmissable? 

(I cant find explanation Google, vaguely spreading rapidly strains) Nit / complexity: vaccines also linear rate 1,533,180 administered 

116,576,359 fully vaccinated (35.1% total, 44.7% adults)

39,186,618 fully vaccinated seniors (71.6%) live Iowa, everybody still wears mask inside stores! Thank providing proper health care children!! Norway super high taxes all. Income taxes much, much lower Netherlands. think regular income tax Norway something like 22% Netherlands it’s close 40% pay health insurance EUR 150/month top that, cover everything. mean think stay lane worry fixing soft ice cream machine 🍦 moron said that. 15 minute observation period waiting checking allergic reactions, exceedingly rare, managed medicine (it's epi-pens for, people food allergies, etc.). Nobody croaked mRNA vaccine. vaccines, fact medicines, even foods eat, slight chance new allergic reaction never encountered before. Pfizer slightly higher incidence allergic reaction regular old vaccine (11 per million vs. single digit per million vaccines). react 15 min first shot almost surely allergic ingredients, since 2nd shot same.

She huge huge net benefit risk reduction getting Covid gets 2nd dose. Beat it! Yeah, told wear mask times recently. Even still, others said places, lot people tend left-leaning want wear mask show right-leaning. 

I'm fine wearing outside, starting get hot (It's high 80's/low 90's F live two weeks straight, 30-34 C) I'm dreading sweating mask. Especially hit regular 100+ F/38+ C days summer. Another relatively strong day - least relative last week.. perhaps actually found bottom now. 

628K first doses compared 377K first doses last Tuesday. Also good McDonald’s among first close open drive only. Forget whether could work: world would want that? harm society number people small overwhelm healthcare system choose remain vulnerable disease? free make choices suffer consequences. society's job keep safe will. Pfizer indeed pushed 6 weeks, maximum recommended delay BioNTech, would call going beyond allowed timeframe. Finland however pushing way beyond 6 weeks, similar Canada example 3-4 months Tbf comparing apples oranges. Canada announced recommending Astro Zeneca anymore blood clots meanwhile saying safe 3 months even concerns Europe.  I’m people getting vaccinated, uhhhh, don’t take health advise *checks notes*... McDonalds?! That’s disappointing, especially considering super high taxes Norway. Yes. It’s wonderful month. Targeting right type people won’t work.   don’t know works. paid every time flu shots providing insurance information. June 1st, everyone U.S. wants vaccine ample opportunity get one

Even conservative. states appointment necessary walk get shot couple weeks now. might want report employee pharmacy supervisor corporate team. Cost cremation rising day day surge deaths, wood scarcity main reason. costing 25000 30000 INR(probably 4-5 month salary). areas one populated poor states. mean sure. live Oreos while. early deaths hypertension big concern covid-19. McDonald's salt content kill eaten everyday. Moderation certainly key things. Heck die drinking much water day. problem CDC presenting science letting people decide risk aversion strategies. They're filtering science lens achieving ""net zero risk"" close get it. instead telling people ""the science says outdoor masking really necessary"" wrap qualifiers half-measures weaken argument, they're deciding EVERYONE best strategy avoid risk, even mostly negligible. 

Obviously fear this, people choose level risk aversion conservative would like, side effect confusing people, taking away credibility. 

Those us really paying attention, reading studies, following science primary sources, close secondaries, see discrepancy studies saying true, CDC recommending. feel like would straightforward honest, let people make risk aversion decisions based facts, would lot less animosity towards right now. 5 people, worth it. mean, blame USA taking steps economy first? abnormal stance things. Yes, J&amp;J mRNA vaccine. CureVac prove good Pfizer/BioNTech Moderna without need freezer, would great. think also took 6 months. fitness still terrible compared before, least think things normally work properly. seen New York City Pizza Rat video? lol Like anyone convinced going swayed fastfood cup. Another empty gesture say right thing, get social points empty gesture cost nothing, continue pay poverty wages essential workers. would lot assuages vaccine hesitancy

No wont. People want vaccine children made minds it. Fully FDA certification not, people going change mind it. anything full FDA certification makes skeptical process ""SuPpOsEd TaKe 10 YeArS!

Maybe take self responsibility eat much. Boom, worry getting diabetes. Always someone else's fault. Oh, America. Doubtful. CDC already given current guidelines show vaccinated people together need wear masks. kids vaccinated, there's reason masks. think people spend 100% time outside ?

Do think people attend fireworks ?

Do think vaccines 100% effective ?

FYI 15 minutes closed space distance enough get infected. Don’t forget third summer mid-October summer’s appetizer March! theory doesn’t make sense though. assume irresponsible people don’t listen CDC, matter messaging is? tell truth. Lmao Florida ahead think that. get covered chocolate, please? worried media reports severe allergic reactions vaccine. 

The CDC released data anaphylactic reactions vaccine. summary, 1 100,000 1 400,000 people allergic reaction requiring epinephrine, majority people history severe allergies. patients studied recovered fully.

2. able eradicate disease nobody take vacine anymore. people vacinate reason disease eradicated put burden people.  somewhat conspiratorial sense wonder if, production related reason, mixed Sputnik V-AstraZeneca trials meant expand possibile 2nd dose options... sure point trying make here. Agreed, also stupid people are. It’s one thing know, it’s another see exemplified. Like George Carlin quote, know dumb average person is, remember half dumber that! typing kind working class mean good try bud Fauci said 10K goal!

Oh mean tricks immune system adapt also effective adaptation covid? where? Food rent get taxed states, living paycheck paycheck likely spending sales tax. don’t weekly supply limits like us. They’re mass producing restricting exports finish vaccinating Americans first. much since they’re producing regularly. I’ve read states rejecting new shipments since they’re still far done inventory hand. worries lot.   Vaccination pleasant way body gaining immunity.

Health Science never politicized!! good make Diet Coke though, gotta watch figure Tbf, Canada delaying 2nd dose four months US following manufacturer's recommendation. lot easier quickly get lots first doses need reserve supply second dose surprising we'd faster countries there.

It's important note mean steps skipped. gets cut front line every time new piece comes in. 

 agree (mostly) professors cited generally courts would sidetracked EUA/Approval distinction, especially employers. comment fair court wants use authorization status, decent arguments support decision. Mandate approved vaccines pretty clear, there's little daylight ""authorized."" Either way, hopefully moot point fall semester. long 7 day average gets ~20k June, I'll consider win. I'm sorry McDonald's cup made make sort significant decision life fucking stupid

It's like people know they're going vote day election, tune regular life? disagree. cases continue go new vaccinations low. That's exponential growth (or reverse case) works. 

Plus, going see people get vaccinated. Colleges require fall school year, get lots. Vaccinations children becoming possible even younger children. full authorization, military start requiring along lots government agencies jobs.

Yeah sure. vaccinations individual getting also reducing spread. short sighted.

I think less schools result spread, person learning:

1. nearly transmission risk infectious disease community initially feared.
2. vastly superior remote learning child development perspective.

There's overwhelming consensus among public health experts schools make every attempt students person, school year. can't even get uber lyft want pay, drivers! Yes, guessed, trying show days incomplete data. incompleteness stretches color code. know could kill inhale much? find surprsing EU mad. really find surprising UK mad, given AZ also underdelivered them

Because making vaccines hard yield necessarily predictable, anyone brain understands this. issue target AZ initially set basically non-point. like countries could go shopping vaccines elsewhere AZ predicted lower target. There's global vaccine shortage, governments forced take whatever get. AZ predicted half many vaccines contract, absolutely nothing would've changed. EU would've still signed choice.

The EU knows this. reason pretend ""mad"" scapegoats initial contract failures onto someone else, Europeans immediately fall without thinking twice. I'm like 99% sure exact opposite effect. People hate told do, especially multi billion dollar fast food company already know poisoning them. cvid19.2.dll safe you, fully-vaccinated individual. necessarily safe everyone around you. We're yet vaccinated everyone willing; people still getting first dose today, meaning they're 5-6 weeks away full vaccination.  think helps rather PR McDonald's.

However one hope best. Yeah, double edged sword covid. go total abstinence messaging know people round suggested precautions down. whole group people rightfully pissed they're dealing restrictions frankly way strict pandemic. point ABSOLUTELY time harm reduction approach, they're unlikely it.  Spanish Flu never left, dropped low background rate considered “acceptable”. good iced coffee. I'd drink two shots caramel shot Pfizer Campbell good guy:) happy them! What’s UI it’s morale, distracting security guarding valuables, he’ll worth wait. 💕 Yeah, there's nothing done. state going overboard getting vaccines distributed place walk-in times fit schedule. thing yet putting DoorDash.

At least get sick, many apparently getting tested. probably means they're experiencing virus something worse generally minimal brief side effects vaccines. (I migraines worse getting dehydrated eating wrong food.)

A vast majority cases going forward people lazy uninformed seek vaccine. freedom get sick, least, collateral damage minimized vaccinated people. Nice free update   Ight thank you

Getting crucified asking lol Here’s quote article: Combine demographic trends understand Vermont, like many New England states, successful vaccinations -- population older White, college graduates Democrats. Mississippi opposite end: younger less White, fewer college graduates Republicans, according Census data. 20 million+ live Taiwan. overreaction. Im virtual I'm lovin' not? vaccinated themselves? can't happen soon enough. mom pad surgery done needed home care get hospital home care people say people coming home would vaccinated. say parents vacciated O2 heart failure one copd other. pretty much isolated year except expert pt pad, wound cleaning, taking care elderly. chose live start pandemic could handle ordering groceries, unpacking things masked cleaning things well housework yardwork usually hire out. expect become expert elderly home care well.. Also...Thanks UPMC giving shit. agree this. went year isolation, worry, death, within last month able get vaccinated. It’s huge behavioral shift drop precautions they’ve used to. Also vaccinations among entire population still &lt;50%, lot people probably take months get used moving back normal. 

Like said, think mid June people enough exposure normal behavior masks become less religious. Act -- US UK quick blocks EU standing around picking nails.

Act II -- EU sues points fingers. ""We incompetent!! -- fault!!""

To fair, botched start they're moving right along looking pretty good. Lawsuits aside. Canada receiving amount - coming US instead EU now. assumed got called jury duty. Turns Bay Area, get engineers, doctors social workers jury matter what. Unless want jury selection process last longer trial. Completely unironically, get effective vaccine administered via drinking it, likely get uptake quite bit.

People like needles. issue CDC always truly risk adverse, point almost every American something CDC’s recommendations daily basis. look CDC guidance forming regulations, don’t base regulations CDC, like many states municipalities Covid. 

If did, bars would limit everyone two drinks. Cigarettes would outlawed. Sodas wouldn’t sold large quantities. could go on, get point. Fox News Facebook lot this. well-intentioned, honestly, huge corporations shit like going poke conspiracy theorist beehive. Ugh. guys negative picky

""Hey everyone kind"" ""I'm already kind want"" snip snap snip snap smoking. vaccines 100 percent effective Except people demand vaccine sold at-cost, earth chasing profit motives? exact opposite. stupid thing say. Yeah, coming state one strictest school lockdowns, infuriated me. Schools - firmly closed. Retail? Open. Bars? Open. Really showed America's priorities. f? specifically said “other European countries” logical say 24% decrease ""plummeting"" context.

Cool, thanks. learnt something new. :) Can’t wait reports coffee thrown innocent McDonald’s workers anti-vaxxer nut jobs. covidiots. Uneducated minimum wage workers give shit people supposed caring for.

Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Meanwhile contractor said federal agency, argue colleagues DAILY CDC recommendations reckless. think agency way loose want stay locked homes wears masks forever. I'm genuine trust science person I'm fucking this. cannot even tell went restaurant without catastrophic shock sound even though I'm fully vaccinated following recommendations. 100% become political. I've seen multiple social media posts people wearing masks outside captions saying ""fully vaccinated want look like republican."" Like...what? look like fool mask outside. That's all. Towns Massachusetts already canceling 4th July celebrations. borderline anti-vaxxism.

The vaccines work, let's act like it. local children's hospital area deep doodoo mold operating rooms/HVAC system, children infected dying (this pre-covid), real possibility even US. Spanish flu never disappeared, continues circulating day. 

This something think put things perspective hear fearmongering variants. Washington... us still phase 2. 25percent capacity. Kids goto school 2 times week. like living cave. That’s thinking official FDA approval change things, feel fine got second shot Friday, felt terrible span first second shot I’m fine probably anxiety anticipation, quicker vaccinations happen quicker back normal  might attracting brigading. It’s easier make decisions numbers, child becomes statistic, it’s hard rationalize. daughter distance learning excelling. loves stress drama classmates every day. see going back vaccinated. vaccinations, seeing many people getting secondhand, i.e., grandchild gets work/college brings grandpa, before. think many folks vaccinated already state we'll see decline even suddenly lifted restrictions - agree immediately, I'd wait everyone wants fully vaccinated, vaccines absolutely accessible Florida adults see day coming soon. 

Anti-vaxxers never wore masks avoided huge gatherings begin with, like it'll spike communities. think guys downvoted understand post actually makes perfect sense.   essentially would mean without proper distancing ventilation, places like restaurants bars worst places go due transmitted particles (airborne droplets) stagnating area period time. give monoclonal antibody cocktail standard stuff, okay. Pretty worried. Reminds way much last year ""Look, supersize you, but..."" Almost 60% eligible population vaccinated think reason exponential person gets covid passes certain amount people. people get virus vaccine amount people passed onto goes down. number also changes things like people inside together mask usage.

So easy numbers could think like this. person gets passes 2 people 2 people also pass 2 people growing exponential rate.

The number people get infected one person keeps going build immunity decline also exponential rate.  think annoying thing Americans getting vaccinated live country easy acquire shot. Places like Japan 1% population vaccinated. countries waiting scraps US citizens casually come excuses vaccinated. really unlikely. sure downvoted possible. Canada catching vaccines. passed EU countries though still behind US UK. per capita vaccinating days even though still behind. 

That said, Canada done month two US given much supply US has. big question many Americans refuse take vs many Canadians refuse. isn’t something clear finish line criteria believe need big symbolic milestones. Reports 70%+ vaccination rates one. Closing large vaccination centers (arenas, drive parking lots etc) first day school late August kids going back campus major one. College football/nfl games full capacity another. Also seeing big chains first mandate ( weeks states) like Costco target rescind rules major. 

Symbolic milestones important show we’re kinda like California one fully believes fire season first decent rain. feel bad county registrar employees sort people's greasy, sticky voter registration forms, that's great idea. arbitrarily picked June 5 months ago I'm arbitrarily sticking it.  Suicides down, depression younger people think that's good way explaining it, yeah. Masks completely stop droplet airborne transmission, effective limiting former, seems primary driver transmission.

A graphic shows difference  trouble starting vaccines, county's Walmart superstore well managed. got Covid vaccines running beginning April. regional vaccine hub started shutting down. plan since everyone region eager vaccinated seen multi-county hub, would close stragglers could get vaccinated Walmart. I'm pretty sure they're taking walk ins now. far people refusing, I'm sure majority here. farther get towards suburbs cities, people take pandemic seriously. small towns rural areas towns, people take seriously. local authorities supported that. probably county wide effort help people get vaccinated. would think would least one instance place community spread low enough effectively contact trace. Yeah, obviously still people getting first doses.

There's probably edge scenarios one considered ""vaccine hesitant"" able make everything line up, think getting first doses would considered ""vaccine hesitant."" might dumb question 

but within realm possibility future country may reserve right let people Pfizer Moderna shots let people J&amp;J shot difference efficacy rates “feel” like cases rising? means nothing. actually check data?  one Except we’re far open countries celebrated “doing right” earlier like Canada Western Europe, also much SE Asia. Yeah, bet they'll feel great knowing many people died attending school. thought 2 weeks? Maybe got wrong.  Required school. He’s asymptomatic. really bad day woman McDonald’s said “have nice day lovely” really cheered up. know unrelated saw M. partnership sold exclusive vaccine rights AZ exchange money, restricted manufacturers producing Oxford vaccine.

The point original plan opening vaccine rights free would manufacturers Merck Sanofi could join full production capabilities produce vaccines could several times higher Oxford vaccine production. Instead took money stuck AZ. absolutely nothing whatsoever Oxford University trying get manufacturing. Honest God, McDonald's offered Big Mac meal combo proof vaccination, America would knock COVID six weeks. think long term COVID care required per federal law, paid states. 

Let Texas's economy suffer years people make claims long term COVID symptoms. states really good job, get benefit weighed down. Really? seem irrationally angry. sucks.

I'd suggest keep trying convince them, example telling concerned Long Covid (which occurs much higher rates serious side effects vaccine). also know parents often pull ""You're 15, hormonal brain can't make decisions"" card whenever try convince something like. Honestly, anyone telling adult sucks, they're bullshitting you. life much better since turned 18 year ago Germany follows pattern Israel opened around 50% June. case numbers June may still bit high would guess July, August latest. It’s always risk, especially scheduling trip months advance pandemic. really want go keep monitoring airplane tickets cause might drop favorable rate. 

Here government provided resources travel Mexico, keep mind government best it’s somewhat reliable source information: states map divided four different color coding: Red, Orange, Yellow, Green. Red basically everything closed, Orange things open mostly avoid going out, Yellow still danger things mostly open, Green everything open precaution. 14 states green, 15 states yellow, 3 states orange, states red. gives overall situation country, would check states plan visit specifically, seem okay part.

I don’t know you’ve already San Miguel de Allende, Copper Canyon (although Chihuahua state great right now), Oaxaca absolutely gorgeous, great food, vibe, historic places visit, definitely recommend going “Mercado de Artesanías” go Oaxaca and/or San Miguel de Allende. Ok, suggesting R0 high vaccination strategy cannot contain virus arguing decimal points? mean read comment he's even talking everyone know vaccinated. comment people vaccinated know people vaccinated. Like I'm starting care less live San Francisco we're 20 cases day. get offended riled guys comments. lived somewhere low vac rate high case rate I'd still little concerned though. I’m good bozo vaccines free. U.S., national health care, least make preventive care free everyone, including annual physical exams, vaccines, teeth cleaning twice year, yearly eye exams, etc. vaccine passports people forging CDC vax cards. can't tell vaxxed unvaxxed.

So health departments MEASURE drops infections vax rates, mask mandates everyone remain. We've relaxed restrictions multiple times past time another spike. latest variants could even worse even ever shrinking unvaxxed pool.

I've vaxxed weeks now. WA changes guidance mask public places required. home? neighborhood? Around vaxxed neighbors? Nah.

It look like numbers coming show vaccine reduces mortality chance infecting someone.

But we've quick jump gun past  pay workers more? pay workers more? guess John Hopkins, Scotland, Israel, many studies don’t convince don’t trust faceless institutions.  part country right now, easily get vaccine appointment. Many places walk-ins, appointment necessary. Vaccines widely available supply demand weeks—sometimes longer depending state. Elderly vulnerable people eligible months. end week, kids 12 older eligible.

Our recent data suggest 2 weeks first mRNA shot, vaccines 90% effective. It’s still good idea get second dose, course. “fully vaxxed plus two weeks” line overly-conservative.

It’s time. don’t want vaccine delaying you’re hesitant, world can’t wait you. You’re accepting risk. It’s necessarily safety concerns, might didn’t time hire pyrotechnics experts, buy fireworks, get paperwork sorted out. usually year stuff, wait nearly last minute year didn’t know we’d July. assumed bot reading small text Yesterday? seriousness clue, preference sooner better, reasonable, truly idea.

Life unfair story old time. That's unfortunate. I'm sorry bud. 

Try getting via one pharmacies may ask approval. 

But said way convince parents? anti-vaxxers? Paywalled Interesting! Thank you.  isn’t meta analysis many R0 studies concluded see even high end estimate reason suspect well adopted inoculation program efficacy current vaccines cannot contain virus. Fair point  McDonalds good fine eaten moderation.

I agressively dislike people think they're good McDonalds.  Americans love mcdonalds ngl aware. saying risks clots two vaccines higher COVID; quite opposite. saying clinical trials aim identify things vaccines rolled part safety assessment. think soft mandates (like employers schools requiring it, insurance companies raising premiums unvaccinated clients) better idea. lot Americans really hate government forcing stuff, react better illusion choice. Right people unemployment waiting take jobs. . . .wait places hiring like crazy can't find people? Sure fire away hope goes well ya 😅🤣  That’s true—there videos overwhelmed hospitals people collapsing middle street . school saying require valid Excelsior pass?

AFAIK saying need vaccinated. different thing, proven vaccination records. haven’t seen types videos places, Italy hospital beds hallway India people streets oxygen, hasn’t type video someone collapsing anywhere else despite comments. 

There’s strong possibility staged, don’t actually know saw videos China anywhere else. includes many estimates Rt extensive contact tracing containment measures deployed, like estimates South Korea. meta analysis good representation R0, mixing Rt R0 estimates. language isn’t English wouldn’t use unfortunately thing actually. Chicago even instructions vaccine websites use services getting vaccinated. June seems optimistic. back 40k today surprising Tuesday. misspoke said 70% Canadians, said something like 'As doctor Team suggested, getting 70% Canadians"" - Tam suggested 70% **of adults** one dose, 35% (I think?) two federal government recommend relaxing restrictions. 

We currently 50% adults day, averaging 1% day, we're really showing slow downs related demand, still hungry first doses. 

This interesting psychological problem, imagine trouble eclipsing US average total coverage least one dose, pass states day metric passed.... 15ish states? We'll pass states like Texas Florida within next days.

I imagine we'll slow demand weeks, we'll 70% adults least one dose - current pace around 25th month. supply more, we're moving second doses well.

All say, think we'll end wider coverage US, however wonder we'll lower eventual 'two dose' number, every indication shows single dose enough efficacy curtail virus, appetite get second dose probably fade fewer fewer deaths cases. 

In states, looks like effect (fewer cases) might contributing apathy getting vaccinated, however 'raced' get wide coverage us, instead focused two doses, suspect end looking different 'final tally'. Something like:


Canada - 80% total population 1 dose, 40% two

States - 65% total population 1 dose, 60% two 8 billion people means 16 million doses.

If US (hypothetically) donated BioNTech vaccine doses every single human ($20 per dose) would cost 16*20=320 billion dollars.

The US GDP 21 trillion dollars. would barely make dent US GDP.

And we're even asking donate much. rescind export restrictions. nationalist, okay, get Well, society forward looking entity. reactive, disregards lessons past, often misguided bad actors personal interests outweighing interests society whole. civilizations eventually fail people move new structured groups, often underlying issues led previous groups fail. expect philosophers kings save us, coming. hope generations line technology empathy able move beyond issues crippled society/civilizations throughout human history. Correct. there's another group include least biased sources US ""media"" that's large group. 

So never tell reading another person thinks. 

I think people know news sources entertainment available,.and I'd enjoy ""entertaining"" like 24 hour ""news"" cycle ones mention. people think that's exists. 🙄

Now I'm ranting. probably worried state tourism places vaccination rates low. Mass one popular destinations celebrate 4th. Nothing  nightclubs bars open think? doubt September. Definitely. point? point CDC going decide we're tell ~~vaccinated people~~ everyone stop wearing masks. remotely fair, public health fairness. should! really helpful link news articles want information use search function see posted. There's tons research people experience severe covid others easy somebody ID articles referring without information. I’m saying comment bad compared things angry atheist subs blaming this.  Hoo boy. know town's cos-patriots hang McDonald's mornings. waiting picket signs. There’s research vaccines curing long covid effects, great.

I think it’s mostly vaccines prevent covid infections, make long covid less likely. 

As breakthrough infections creating long covid, that’s something don’t think people going able figure while, would think would less prevalent due deceased severity disease vaccinated person, that’s going tiny amount people. Lol, happens, especially similar names. True  1000 people got corona millions people come,and protests thousands got thabligi thing proper start Covid. Got mine morning, arm pretty sore (far sore get flu shot nothing debilitating) later day. chills (so guess fever? check) night particularly uncomfortable (I get hot sleep anyways almost nice). woke 3 probably top 5 worst headaches whole life (maybe #2, think I've actual migraine worse). took tylonel kicked half hour later went away able go back sleep. woke 6 arm pain already gone headache coming back. took tylonel 9 (about 6 hours ago now) back I've felt fine since, basically 24 hours total symptoms, starting really 12+ hours shot.

It varies lot - think got easy. I'm glad something happened though unreasonable paranoia shot nothing (I mild cold - fever - got first shot worried would mess something up.) Right, can’t get complacent? I’m vaccinated. Everyone socialize vaccinated. 

I’ll always comply rules regulations, want sit damn bar inside watch baseball friends. want go Yankees game big group wear mask sipping beer. 

Complacency fine you’ve done part. I’m getting really tired anti-vaxx assholes holding rest us back. Java jabs.  marketing would appropriate would following: safer take vaccine eat food. USA saving economy first position pivot help others may actually save lives. afford send foreign aid, many would starve medical care.

Regardless, sending vaccines out. “If advice disconnected reality, slow, make irrelevant”

Reminds bit early WWI generals armies. could concerted effort vaccinate everyone starting high risk individuals equally. reckon would dramatically reduce deaths. Saving human lives matters. Hey Republican ""fuck feelings"" crowd wants come table know, talk, we're ready waiting... AZ per contract change pricing July. black white situation. Except young kids (toddlers pre-schoolers), kids appear less likely get infected, they're much likely asymptomatic get infected, meaning lot cases go unnoticed.

Once infected, kids viral load that's similar adults, meaning they're less likely transmit virus.

Israel start vaccinating kids soon vaccine kids approved there. anyone remember back pandemic first started like January/February 2020, videos coming China people randomly collapsing streets/hospitals? ever deal that? think back wanted spend week Mexico City, Puebla. visit colonial-era cities like San Miguel de Allende another week. either Copper Canyon Oaxaca. worry cases rise variant develops means German government would quarantine 14 days want do.

YOU DONT KNOW THAT, HASNT BERN STUDIED

How comment better article. stating something know fact. allowed go NZ without issue - delay returning. benefits outweigh negatives. Economies suffered much expected. Internal Australian tourism booming. Thanks mate - yeah really look great front. said, I'm holding either common travel bubble immediate family, better case scenario; degree change policy Australia hit level herd immunity. Don’t think need statistic figure one out, friend Nah downsides approach, I've always thought foolish anyone celebrating like they'd pandemic come conclusion everywhere. 

I absolutely commend Australia NZ low death counts ability maintain domestic normality initial phase, going tricky navigate next phase. know experience anti-vax sentiment NZ least quite high, often people lean left quite susceptible reason.

On top that, everyone know extremely sheltered perspective dangers pandemic really lived way. young friends seem really extreme personal risk assessment danger covid considering age, compared place like UK everyone knows someone it, people NZ done.

This part success - population sufficiently alarmed resulted compliance lockdown policy tell. 

That going hard undo even population vaccinated. time try raise conversation ""what next?"" friends family based react defensively take personally reluctance answer question, tell media that's true public discourse too. 

The political sell reopening accepting level inevitable death infection going something I'm convinced popular current Labour government stomach for. Thank - absolutely will. Good luck it!  Cases time high. world great many countries little vaccine protection stage, increased transmissibility variants still concern. concern US/UK/EU perhaps, important remember that's everything. article says speed spread factor they're primarily looking at. 

This variant spreading quite alarmingly fast UK, even UK variant standard here. surprised one REALLY fast spreader. I'm worried vaccine escape hear different, increased transmissibility wreaked havoc pre vaccine UK EU, that's got great concern parts world low protection. Agreed. long underlying conditions related blood clots, fine AZ. difference risk taking pill. fit risk factors AZ real reason wait. real issue virus made sense take things slow. didnt help EU prevented paid vaccines leaving Europe. hasnt local death 6 months. That’s awesome!

I vax’d, polio ‘ro’vid, cutting edge risks. Whether it’s something afraid pretty personal course. 

Nobody depends me. did, that’d change ton life decisions. Going step further, I’m consent. kid can’t *truly*consent something like vaccine trial; mom/dad make judgement call, (in imagination) would hard me. know fact there’s trial means somebody smarter assessed risk, there’s one-in-a-million I’m guilty forever pain/suffering? 

Humanity appreciates regardless &lt;3 Call around. Look online. Even specialized doctors give vaccines currently like example skin doctor area. still follow priority lists course put people last group lists already finish priority groups. possible also tell doctors close would willing take vaccine short notice someone misses appointment. need fully switch Hausarzt, stay current one even get vaccine elsewhere. Also inform local vaccine center works. tell me: it’s little complicated you’re trying present.  Seems breakdown 38k Simopharm approximately 22k AZ. 

I read article around third cases among vaccinated people (though mention vaccine). would put vaccine efficacy around 50%? (You would expect 60% cases effect?). least one vaccines must effect, would interesting see breakdown vaccinated people tested positive see vaccine Japan 1% vaccinated though COVID rates going up.

Worst example East Asia. Taiwan would better I'm referring stated article itself, though surely ramp point. far though appears urgency internally countries, find concerning longer term reopening them. That's weak argument particular point tho. government's responsibility stop spying, individuals responsibility evade surveillance. 

Btw personally I'm still going wear mask long time (only health / comfort reasons tho)  Probably not. happening cities, imagine count countryside. Paying San Francisco level rent Seattle weather getting Tenesse wages though. Wait till read Bangladesh’s population. So?

Not sure else do. Think way. Covid-19 already shown long-term side affects. people still symptoms months infection. vaccine live virus risk. long term side effects 6 months. Kids (under 16) still vaccinated Israel. Last month, they'd still vaccinated hundred, part trial particularly high risk. Murphy mainly going CDC recommendations now, he's removed almost restrictions.

CureVac says CureVac's plans large roll impacted this. CureVac approved anywhere yet yet released Phase II/III clinical trial yet (but expected soon).

Meanwhile Pfizer Moderna supply problems signing partners manufacture vaccine.

Frankly raw materials scarce would prioritize vaccine makers six months ahead... need make sure distribution vaccines equitable rather divert raw materials new player.   Yeah that’s really good! get lot antivaxx dumbfucks restaurant awesome sure part saying bad.

But US population including everyone (even infants/children) roughly [330 * 1000 = 330 billion [330,000,000,000], 0.33 trillion

Alternatively, 5.736 trillion 5,736 billion + 330 billion = 6,066 billion = 6.066 trillion

So, unless saying problem including entire population 330 vs. 300 (which said did...and know much eligible population might expand future), see issue.

Generally speaking, online systems going slow update - even start administering shots 12-15 year olds Thursday, possible (maybe even likely) online scheduling systems providers updated reflect decision. better bet would probably either calling (or parent call) PCP, going place administers walk-in vaccinations children (some places many places don't). thing is, *standard* open trade. standard world acting. halt trade, deign give small quantity doses gift, feels kinda lame, European factories producing doses Canada along.

Yes, situation US bad, Americans rightfully vaccinated first. US situation better world, far ahead vaccinations, producing needed domestically -- that's I'm saying time lift export restrictions. disaster. friend, older guy wife young child lives Miami. 

He scared go out, said masks uncommon knew several people died covid building alone.

Yeah, agreed. big corporate people step this, less genuine feels. really think someone sitting fence gonna tip fucking McDonald's? Mecha health? Again, it’s myths issue. know don’t cause autism microchips. concern lack knowledge long term consequences way aware tested long term. Fuck that. yobbo getting paid get vaccine want amount.  me. far I'm concerned anyone walk drug store get vaccine, over. matter many actually do, matter much covid still cruising around world.

Because point, good gonna get. likely get 70% adults, especially Pfizer gets full FDA approval. Problem specific cities regions local numbers far lower. areas concern moving forward, hopefully strains emerging anywhere international manageable boosters moving forward. Say canada gets 1.4 million dose shipment week. That's entire supply use one week. Instead using 1.4 million 1 day, we're splitting doses using percentage per day. theory give us relatively steady vaccination rate daily, would use aprox 200,000 per day next shipment arrived. day 1 wohld still 1.2 million storage, end thr week next shipment arrived, would 200,000 sort buffer case shipment late. amount storage falls throughout week doses used spikes get next shipments. Ya fucking think?! No, people living. Epidemiologists, Virologists, many others. Meanwhile people walk like ""have ever heard personal choice?"" like came something groundbreaking. Also, Desantis bigoted hack. anything sweet lobbying cash. Came say duh.  1.5 million doses Canada 2.5 million Mexico, sooo impressive.

Really feel like r/ChoosingBeggars times.

""Yes, helping, help *more*, selfish jerks?""

Classy. *continues Evidence whether AZ mRNA vaccines give protection first dose mixed best, slightly favors AZ depending measure (death/hospitalization/infection/transmission) using need get angry pal, nice discussion calm R0 useful number doesn’t tell everything infectivity, 

Sure, tell us something. tells us SARS-COV2 extremely infectious virus might cause us doubt whether effective inoculation program could work. tells us pathogens managed contain vaccines education (but social engineering measures) SARS-COV2 said “these measures keep classrooms safe” based data didn’t happen include superspreader...

You see paper 2% infected people potential super spreaders given point time. far likely large defined cohorts like school classrooms (where many millions individuals go) incidence potential super spreaders constant. Two percent simply large somehow present recent past. argue otherwise would suggest something radical changed nature infections, evidence of.

What likely (as far aware) infection goes viral load spike lasts 2% time infection. is, everyone gets infected goes short period contagious. scenario improving effectiveness adjustments vaccine strategy would difficult.

I agree identification super spreaders (if individuals rather time infection) could allow better targeted vaccine strategy could even game changer. vaccine strategy obviously improved targeting difficult imagine vaccine strategy somehow becoming less effective presence super spreaders always there. would postulate *more* super spreaders i.e. change nature SARS-COV2 infection. impossible grant again, evidence moment. Probably doesn’t make less sanitary much indians shit river. IMO, really something could affect USA next pandemic. USA keep top-tier production capabilities, able secure supply scenario. would think economic implications. 

Other regions (mainly EU) allowed local production facilities export world. words, western pharma able enter many markets factories outside USA able make business abroad. may factor kept mind future investments. still invest USA, course, share ivestments kept abroad may become larger next years. Particularly, would bet tray develop industry countries EU, South America India. There’s already shortage nursing home workers  Oh sweet summer child. make correct. Go get Vaccine ape.   makes lot sense look number doses administered per 100 people. Numbers EU highly comparable everyone gets similar amount vaccine. countries around 40 doses per 100 people.  single documented Covid infection anywhere world casual outdoor interactions, walking past someone street eating nearby table.

This single important part article.

Outdoor masking exist anyone: vaccinated, unvaccinated, adults, children, infants, seniors, immunocompromised, matter. *Not single documented case.* even said, headline faux news online course RemindMe! 30 days mean MSM like CNN, Fox, NBC, well listed. Reuters agenda like those. Well, they're get cancelled anti-cancel culture crowd.  town appointments Thursday Friday kids cause go Wednesday. How's vaccine rollout going there? entire population access vaccine well then?  Uh, duh hello town automatically signing kids Thursday Friday cause CDC clearing Wednesday. Gotta look bright side man know enough people they're basically extremely stubborn children. take covid seriously see ""city slick"" issue little fucking idoits know insignificant lives truly right? they're fucking idoits, arent special probably dont unless crowded street.

This still massively conservative, point science denial. Definitely city live. cant go anywhere without vaccine card anymore advertising require vaccine.

Do example this? EVEN harder time hiring actually advertising this. Nobody wants work antivaxxers anymore antivaxxers. Conservative people tend fear-motivated, easy manipulate ""they're trying ta get ya!"" narratives.  absolutely hate this. It’s also probably necessary. hate living world it’s probably necessary. You’re idiot fine CDC step political cultural moment. expect follow science -- need follow science, exclusion concerns.

But article points CDC well behind science, too. honestly impossible judge layperson. certainly seems way me, though, hope institutional lessons learned this. put dihydrogen monoxide everything nowadays! shit Mississippi Alabama bottom another statistic? Really? Wow, saw coming! point, good gonna get. 

Except that's true. People protected much community spread. would funny people quit jobs this, don’t doubt happen somewhere Got triggered word used. Approved comment. day late know. think going happening much low vaccine states. Perhaps McDonald's could host vaccine clinics (those mobile vans, least), give $10 coupon something everyone vaccine card. would something least. widespread, people absolutely did. people sold 28,000 bottles COVID-curing bleach total revenue $1 got tickets see Lion King Broadway October tickets zero taxes ticketmaster fees right now, exciting shit probably become mandatory receive full FDA approval. Mandating emergency-authorization drug would get prickly. Ohhh bananochips...those favorite. post this. Thanks Yeah situation bad beyond burning bodies street they’re thrown river.  Would nice could pay employees livable wage working said pandemic. initial reaction question hell takes medical advice coffee cup.

Then realized, probably people deny information verified institution.

Whatever works, guess. get smaller kids? Grades schoolers desperately need school starts fall. fair, rest world wants even vaccine doses. simply market freedom acquire raw materials used now. Yes, several. That's email put out. know reacted office today (I work home 3 days week) - sure hear stories go tomorrow!

I honest though - 2 ones know terrible employees around would honestly sad see go. bad attitudes everything. reason, people use excuse ignore nice things. personally, trust grimmis says face value. however, side issue. nuggets delicious..... wait.... wait..... could make special vaccine sauce got it... get people hyped up.... worked before... digress. I'd take side bet. daily rate case best thing look - due reporting lags (and visible 5 days higher numbers 2 days lower numbers repeats cycle - caused less reporting happening weekends). daily rate lot noise caused differing reporting lags.

It's best look 7 day moving average, trend 7 day moving average. UK 10 day trending downwards. Okay I'm thinking trolling.

The numbers cited article definition limited, US government limiting them.

Canada Mexico signed contract Pfizer. Meaning doses come US they'd come Europe. really need explain increases supply elsewhere creates net gain?   So, target audience.  hiding bodies? Undercounting cases easy, hospitalizations deaths bit harder sweep rug. I'm reasonable incentive get people vaccinate. Free hotdogs beers baseball games, gift cards, direct cash payments - long gets someone get vaccine, that's good thing. 

On hand, significantly lowered risk dying *should* incentive enough, know true lot people. may clear UK (and probably lot people are) app already access medical records vaccination status. information stored NHS database app developed thing changing splitting vaccination record separate section within app show medical history using board flight example.

For want use app paper certificate also live, social security number is, fingerprints are.

The app details anyway. SS numbers record fingerprints UK citizens unless arrested. still can’t drink inside favorite dive bars unless I’m table. can’t meet friends bar six foot rule limited seating. 

Yankees games require proof vaccine (I’m that), sit two friends, wear masks. 

Broadway still closed. Same. try buy it, daughter wants drink. gets sick week Happy Meal. yeah that's good point!  Exactly. pro-vaccine, none business whether neighbors, office-mates, people pass street, etc vaccinated. vaccine plus immune system give reasonable level protection. people them. lots nice things. Good job, Americans! really encouraging otehr countries behind vaccination. you’re drinking mcdonald’s coffee worried what’s vaccine /s  No. NSA grade micro-microchips... Nanochips. /s Question tricky one herd immunity. May high 80% required w highly transmissible variants.

Vaccines w less 80% efficacy may leave gap.

But basic ""any port storm"" point practice &amp; true. Honest apple juice comes Happy Meals juice give kid anyway it’s watered down. dont like taking mask on/off every time go indoors? much comfy keep one whole time im outside house Preprint articles require higher degree scrutiny rigor accurately evaluate many types articles. kind discussion would appropriate strictly scientific subreddit /r/COVID19.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* true maybe past month we've (somewhat) supply demand, [the U.S. already started exporting expect U.S. continue loosening restrictions -- make sense U.S. keep vaccines away neighbors allies. takes time work process, Biden administration seems cautious general. mean it? means experiment working. Wyoming pathetic one based population. suburb people.

Oh fun fact, 2 escalators: 50% 33%.

Nothing write home about. would considered safe you? You’re vaccinated. Seems pretty safe me. anti-social individual, confirm. Personally one hand right.On fucking idots wont take entrenched thinking whole thing giant conspiracy special. Except body concern. someone abortion, slogan comes from, making choice effects body.

When vaccinated choose to, choosing risk passing cannot vaccinated. choosing put mild discomfort ahead lives. fundamentally selfish ashamed. wait, put dihydrogen oxide coffee? cant believe this. people realize dangers chemical??? Lol didn’t reply directly it. Check buddy. replied child comment it. 

Yea stay mad much better done Canada. wonder Canada fucked up. nerds can’t read, playing VR day instead contributing society getting vaccinated! ""if say often enough, people believe true,"" tatic, think. + convenience push hesitant people edge. 

And clear, I'm pro vaxxer... Go Moderna Mafia! lol think MacDonald's, think authority healthy living. /s Kind funny, first read says India Covid variant global concern? posted thread, shots already begun. CDC advisory committee that, advisory committee. power. authority allow shots approved. Anyone start anytime like, fully states want start. Course, look CDC guidance.

Considering we're massive surplus shots lack willing arms... they're happy immediately start opening things up. still vaccinating 3 4 million adults per day severe lack shots expand further, recommendation may hold now. that's case.

To highlight point, Ohio already announced they'll expand age 12 beginning Wednesday, even waiting recommendation. estimating R0 variants given clean datasets emerged well behavior changes level infection?

If original COVID-19 R0 range 2.5-5 variants demonstrate 2x transmissibility origin type, wouldn’t put R0 likely 5 (though naive approach, it’s starting point), making par infectious diseases (though quite measles level, I’ve read estimates measles like 15+, US freak never outbreak, even people neutralizing vaccine). See, something bad happens everything stops look it.

How people still think worst things beyond me.   media blowing every single potential concern proportion certainly annoying, also evidence variant evade vaccines, nobody knows actual data. Yeah, that's weird part... around we're seeing lots rural areas US opposition vaccination become part religious/political identity

Source? Sounds like utter garbage me. Data would helpful, Chief. vaccine schedule UK initially 3 weeks apart extended 12. responses may correct Chief Medical Officer say 12 week intervals give population first dose, therefore lowering risk people (albeit lower amount) quite interested see mountain biking badminton local places call book appointment.... Individually.

What fuck. whole Tokyo many deaths small town 60,000 people. Yay vaccines! London infrastructure there. last article read saying due steroid treatment hospitalised patients, causes even non diabetics raised blood sugar reduced immune response. perfect environment hospital acquired fungal infection. unfortunately, ive read, extremely high mortality rate poor prognosis, get it, probably already dead study six months older started March results expected July. i've worked way pandemic, daily routine helped lot. get depressed mental health issues. Yes shit days thats life, nothing made want get bed.

Once over, get back complaining things life. sums mixed response pandemic... factor deaths influenza + COVID-19 taking lives would died causes. scientist im pretty sure evolution Cases don’t matter anymore. Anyone wants vaccine get one. shouldn’t let anti-science anti-vax control lives. risk  That's really fair point. Thanks explaining! ever get anything Grandma? bureaucracy, seems lack young doctors according folks here. verge insanity trying work new things buy. ""must bribe me"". However bribes going I'd foolish one. I'm actively trying make anyone sick. understand point view though, everyone living circumstances though. what's best encourage others same. get one current Covid-19 vaccines, fully protected. think need read ""efficacy"" available vaccines.

They reduce severity symptoms, may prevent hospitalization/death, that's Scientists guarantee stage.

You currently still get Covid-19 fully vaccinated.

(DON'T read I'm saying get vaccine- certainly saying that. get vaccine, mask social-distance anyway.) thought children required parental consent get vaccinated? way knowing, gut says waiting CDC scrap least reduce indor mask usage COVID-19. Worldsometers says 241 yesterday. Dont get wrong reaching fewest number deaths since start good eitherway still. Previous medical studies indicated rather negligible differences vaccine responses young adults teens. allowed study much smaller adult study covered large age range. mean margin error 100% effectiveness larger study could 95% larger study. Pretty much me. mean we've missed going concerts such. certainly hardship though. got second shot today, learned friend's mom beat two cancers lost Covid morning. 2021 NJ's website lot volatility R_0 always found odd. also 0.27 little bit ago seems pretty unrealistic. used website rt. pace continues 7-day average reach fall low week.  require full panel vaccines city's public schools state wants ban requiring covid vaccines.  Hell yeah, hopefully next kids 5 up. expert respect reasoning makes lot sense me. bad

Also, Japan like huge amount old people? 
If vaccination problem solved soon situation become much worse people know died 3 times vaccine I'm seriously doubting 'black fungus' ever heralds good news. 12 year olds lmfaooo Japan still ATMs close overnight (stop working). cash still mostly cash-based society - good luck? also that's wait two Moderna shots 4 weeks instead 2 weeks getting Pfizer shots. Myocarditis seen people higher likelihood getting Myocarditis covid. There's reason believe children get it. face shut faster remember tabligi thing actual reason corona big thing India Hindu priests responsible meanwhile Muslims spat nurses destroyed hospital property getting tested. says article, 300k number directly analysis University Washington. comment existence mention higher thought. Bro, give brazil 

Things good here...

But counter point, government sucks might end sitting random place time... Japan fills train cars up, shove like sardines can. smart thing reschedule stoped immediately religious leaders priests blaming kumbh mela proper reports Sources people got corona. Honestly think way forced vaccinations. like normally, may way end this. Lol speech marks around ""success"". pretty big success  quite simple. lot support staff Sherpa Porters meet lot sleep shared tiny tents. point something said accurate? really though. suggesting size country makes things harder, reality actually providing advantage case. far likely facilities produce vaccines, exactly occurred, banned export entirely could vaccinate people. vast majority US population lives cities, lot people spread out, they're still fairly concentrated terms vaccine delivery. like Alaska dragging average here. 

Even benefit, 2nd total vaccination rate, even third, least fourth First dose 2nd dose numbers globally. 

You're 10th daily vaccination rate per capita daily. 

Not mention 1800 deaths per million population, three times rate Canada (a physically larger country US way) Fifty-one times worse Australia (also physically large country). think crowding, almost twice bad Germany. 

You good job part whole mess. whole thing even exploded first Europe, got warning from, still fucked bad hardest hit developed European countries (Italy, UK, Spain) within 10% terms deaths per capita)

The fact think good job downright ridiculous. I’m feeling elated getting first shot! That’s one positive side effect getting vaccine lol. calling summer blockbuster horror film? remember typically kids 12-15 aren’t allowed make medical decisions themselves. KID may eager vaccinate, parent may present additional barrier. Also, parents who, willing vaccinate themselves, want wait vaccinate kids due fears longer term effects/newness. interesting see factors impact many kids actually get fully vaccinated. Also even higher plan produce double triple 2022 (partnership major manufacturer). huge good news everyone. House Pfizer rise up! Needs cancelled nature healing traffic returning New Jersey. anxiety train many years. found early lockdown relief fast pace world around me. We're way. Still house. People acting like we're ridiculous.  supersites fast hack too. 30 mins including 15 minutes observation. come feel like 

Pfizer: wants sell third shot beyond 

BioNtech: wants show vaccines superiority state 70% adult population vaccinated cancelling outdoor event even going happen another 2 months (when rates vaccination undoubtedly even higher rates COVID-19 almost certainly even lower). need wait state and/or county make announcement. Many counties excess vaccine probably expand eligibility quickly. would expect see headlines report accurate, positive news? Lol people even publish articles saying going fully reopen, listed restrictions it. Journalism joke. primarily seen diabetic patients whose immune systems decimated corticosteroids.  Got appointment Saturday! Can't wait party (covid safe course)  Yessssssss!!!!!!!  Hey grats graduating!

I'm done month opting skip virtual graduation planning vax party late June instead I'd say go it! probably non-medical O2 tanks used everywhere (I bet even hospitals central line) worse -- given outside. 

Has everyone seen RUSTY unclean tanks rolled street monkey shit 2 mins ago hooked person suffering breathe in? looks gross. 

Seems likely vector me. Jesus fuck. think imma take walk, see guys another time let die, JFC... get CDC sign off, don’t know couldn’t happen concurrently. Like know going get approved barring huge thing, since they've already vaccinated millions millions people, could’ve timed better.

I know couple days extra, I’ve worrying kids COVID 424 days already I’m starting lose it. less spreads, less mutates. Supposedly mutate frequently, spreading much still regularly see variants. people get vaccinated, see fewer mutations. still possible COVID become endemic, need get people vaccinated quickly possible. Ah, maybe form join sign-up list leftovers? leftover lists Scotland unfortunately, volunteer vaccine centre havent got letter arent getting lol. Would nice implemented system too. Yeah, I've looking first doses since people started saying demand gone down.

We're still getting 5 million first doses week, exactly nothing. shoot soon 12-15 approval. like Brazil 2016. gonna happen whether riots not. would think people right saying whether Olympics held year. Ok, bs...We know chances. B.1.351 already rendered AZ vaccine VASTLY less effective. crap shoot long/if/to degree outrun RNA vaccines. one day .0000002% . That's ludicrous notion. completely wrong. city 2 digit COVID cases right vaccine isnt something we're clamoring for. helps everyone wears masks without complaint. normal life. Wow much good news lately! Really excited future. hope so. 

Teens dumb stubborn parents, currently hold keys US herd immunity. Please put pressure folks. issue accurate wording research papers.

It's hard control media running low probabilities blowing proportion.

It's like scientist completes decade long study identified individual 0.0001% dying via rogue balloon floats house suffocates sleep.

The media run say ""watch dangerous murder balloons could kill sleep"". Right pharmacy chain site, rules. California there's state run portal (which beset sorts problems glitches) appears list publicly run privately run sites – still got click whatever scheduling setup site want has. bit shit show different counties different rules, course private chains rules top that.

I got one shot private pharmacy (CVS) one shot large health insurance company (Kaiser Permanente). Kaiser large state California was/is treating county purposes vax disbursement.  told two different experiences. sounds like there's less chaos Japan, honestly think Kaiser done good job, overall still easy be. Wow, something worse Trump’s roll out. unlikely required schools areas need help getting population vaccinated. still explain see UK, us, Israel (ie massive spikes unvaccinated people). difference Chinese vaccine. gah gah goo goo 🤪  people starved antimask anything find interesting heard years religious face covering woman oppressive year people prefer anonymity barrier. Imagine done whole life? worry kids though seen introverted kids seem introverted comfortable mask on. over. Agreed. I'm 30s mostly got vaccine prevent unknown side effects vaccine (plus community spread obv). concerned dying months long brain fog many experienced sounds scary. can't imagine long term effects. seven year old obviously vaccinated. isn’t scientific consensus risk unvaccinated children large groups running around outdoors day. evidence youth sports caused outbreaks. son concerned masks anyway probably would go camp without one. 

There isn’t single outdoor group setting area seen people unmasked. Even hiking trails require masks here. It’s really walking outside neighborhood people don’t wear masks (we don’t mask environment either). It’s really big deal though. Masks aren’t hard wear. Thank you!! Narrator: *they not*

A coworker cruise right COVID started spreading, lot ships got quarantined sea. ship set hand washing buffets dining rooms requiring people wash hands entered. saw least 20 people screaming workers ruining vacation didn’t need wash hands threatening sue. One lady literally fell ground kicking screaming didn’t need wash hands vacation dare rolling around floor screaming infringing freedoms US can’t make anything. 

People gross. pandemic pretty much made clear. Wearing thin cloth barrier using hand sanitizer clearly much 50% country. Trust me, don’t clean well home either. Holy shit that's month's worth vaccine production India could cover shortfall supply honesty seems like sanitation issue equipment rather anything inherently coronavirus Children spread schools super spreaders.

I’ve made point clearly. Shouldn’t mandatory vaccines level violates personal freedom. couldn’t glean that? said, fatality rates hard track down, incredibly useful tool visualizing also think controversial note certain countries (like Sweden) took light-touch approach compared others like France, Germany, UK. outcomes pretty easy visualize tool.

Same true U.S. states. States like Florida Georgia took light-touch approaches, again, think that's controversial note.

Wow, really? give source that? like one extreme believing pandemic real, think going extreme admit unable move on.

Hopefully, rather small subset population many us would like move considered safe so. Globally pandemic far over, though. I'm advocating life fear - since household vaccinated we've back shopping, dining, getting together family, etc - I'm also aware many Americans still unvaccinated, super not-over much world, good maintain awareness local community spread status variants, etc. Wearing shoes wearing mask two completely different things. 

One thing done thousands years, doesn’t cover place breathe from, doesn’t make socializing hearing people speak difficult. 

The pretty much brand new west, covers facial expressions, uncomfortable lots people (you don’t get tell what’s comfortable what’s comfortable). little bit difference there. live liberal area guess that's why. taken whole thing serious gotten vaccinated want see get prolonged anymore Well, Gange origin cholera guess waters bit cleaner back then...

Honestly overall dislike masks, anonymity aspect quite nice. However, highly doubt there’s enough people permanent mask-wearing become anything. anonymity reason still wearing mask, “get away it” plenty people still are, fade background. point one else be, walking building mask like equivalent walking wearing ski mask. would look stats thought read vax like 90% effective preventing transmission. true? beat it. risk getting covid outside: low, risk getting cases going down: low-ish, risk getting vaccinated: low. risk getting severe covid vaccinated: extremely low. 

All risks multiply get infinitely close zero. think people would understand biotech industry.

Having said that...I work industry know multiple antivaxers idk deal is. Oh see edited earlier comment sources. I'm asking ""prove"" anything, again, I'm merely asking defend viewpoint. 

Again, mischaracterizing position, I'm saying infallible opinion, I'm merely asking confident results? 

I've seen sources I'm happy discuss them. First all, may want careful sources using prove point, first source, explicitly *is talking medical cloth masks,* aka 99% actual masks everyone using. 

In fact, explicitly mentions results (towards end paragraph want verify yourself): ""Medical masks effective, cloth masks even less effective.""  

Again, whole concern, masking seems really pointless unfounded data.  

Your second source MMWR peer-reviewed journal, digest. **That's okay,** *I can't stress enough okay is, I'm trying call liar/otherwise* something aware asking peer reviewed sources, providing peer reviewed sources yourself. four page summary data points. problem source three fold: 

Firstly, specifically talking 0.7%-1.9% reduction cases. saying within margin error, man that's tight margin error. impossible deduce real data that, find hard see explicit causation there. 

Secondly, review counties *weren't* mask mandates. kind seems like whole point. know variables working without understanding control?  

But, sake argument, let's assume true, masks really help 1%. 0.7% 1.9% slowed rates far cry touted ""70% effectiveness"" see people throw around time political pundits general media. makes discussion much nuanced harder answer. 

Thirdly, article itself, makes note cases saw general decrease, *no statistical evidence* deaths saw particular uptick decrease due masks.  

From page 351 MMWR cited: death growth rates restrictions lifted not
statistically different reference period,
whereas significant differences daily case growth rates were
observed 41–60 days restrictions lifted. 

Now, leave reviewer determine 0.7-2.0% differences significant not, me, casts even doubt efficacy masking.  

In terms *effectivness* cloth medical masks, generally known long time. every box medical masks, even now, still says ""does protect viruses infectious disease."" general viewpoint start changing culturally last year. I'd love share charts data see think, specifically asked peer-reviewed sources, here's check out, happy discuss you.  

[Open Access Medical Journal - cluster randomised trial cloth masks compared medical masks healthcare  

[Not peer reviewed study, quite clear medical masks work

No one forcing get vaccine. don’t want get choice. 

What point then, besides don’t want get vaccine?

I know enough either predict likelihood Coronavirus' Who's talkin trauma? 🤔 Congratulations. federal ID system feds literally track everywhere businesses patronizing when. also health records rolled feds know everything health doctor knows. never ever abused anyone. officially determined vaccinated don't/can't spread?

No. Now, mean get amount, course vaccine strong sterilizing effect, make immune, protects you.

So yes, even vaccinated, strong community transmission around still good idea wear mask. I’m actually polar opposite. feel like Wfh really blurred lines work-time leisure-time me. made things little stressful. also felt like social interactions work helped bit. hope least get pandemic sort hybrid model.  preprint almost year. common medical research ? maybe published somewhere else ? Letting trauma drive decision making deeply unhealthy sincerely think go therapist. There's really interesting rift opening right now.

On one side people (and say I'm one them) least normalized wear mask things like public transit, one jackass rows keeps hacking lung out, milk cough, measure protection. MANDATED mind you, socially acceptable.

On side people like replied past try make point said ""No! I'm tired seeing people's faces!"". I'm sorry friend, right see fucking face. That's super weird entitled. People may arrested conservative states wearing face mask... might get Nah. Thanks! Make sure gets fixed shot it'll mess insurance billing.  That's single chart provide. **also** provide record ""Daily deaths COVID-19 death certificate date death."" That's far directly-comparable.

I'm sure UK counts death within 28days positive test measure.

...when multiple datasets they're putting out.

(As aside, interesting note Total deaths COVID-19 death certificate actually much higher Total deaths within 28 days positive test. latter actually restrictive category, given tens thousands Covid deaths happened without official test first half pandemic, tests rationed.) West Virginia kinda surprising given really well initial rollout. really poor population, many without reliable transportation, though. sure people ignorant. We've seen play time time national numbers falling tell whole story. 

Cases surged spring states high vaccination rates time states low vaccination rates fell. WA recent surge. I'm sure what's going agree virus done us yet. 

I'm strong opinion see early summer surge like saw last summer southern states. southern states struggling reach 50% vaccination rates people 65+. Deaths hospitalizations places high. Maybe misunderstood point. Sure long based discrimination protected category (age, sex, race, etc). Choosing serve smokers ppl stupid wear shoes masks discriminatory, safety. realize introverts minority.  Like saying cook steak well done. think possible. immune response something like 6 13 days vaccination.

It also possible get cold. got bad head cold month ago, got tested covid negative. idea could caught cold lockdown happened. Don’t forget common retirement age back 55 - born 1946. also first baby boomers start retiring.  No, two reasons. One, surface transmission pretty well ruled out. Two, airborne putting something hands absolutely nothing. 6mons get Pfizer vaccine, coupled youth press marketing campaign talking next generation slogan might make 70% vaccination. 

Getting 30% Americans stuck Trump cross enemy lines get shot incredibly hard overcome. It’s political choice folks point, crazy. sending seven year old day camp year going go masks use much wants. Knowing him, never take except swim. friends sending camp also want kids wearing masks. article SUNY doing, pending full authorization expected happen fall. I've mostly fine pandemic (minus cancelling wedding reception getting married immediate families present last April) damn, CDC said go outside without mask realized I'm still terrified wearing it. I've fully vaccinated nearly two months, want go without mask. want back large crowds. think take long time ok standing shoulder shoulder strangers eat packed restaurant. cross coronavirus approach intriguing, honestly made wonder effective current vaccines neutralizing coronaviruses encountered. keep saying consequences actions like hanging phrase . It’s consequence don’t want undertested drug body say so. really want know see point cognitive dissonance whatever? government? Neither I. haven’t forced anyone anything, crybaby. Wow, sure part PA opposite situation. Literally everyone either wear mask wears wrong. I've multiple people approach talk shit I'm wearing mask. Whenever try contactless anything here, look like I'm making things up. extra dead people

Where? getting handful deaths per day. ""why everyone pretending over?!"". like want end.

Honestly think suits people. like excuse avoid people public places, stay inside, cover face. weird lot people like apparently. federal system, required verifying purchasers. simple QR code pulls recent photo, address, phone number, health status, etc. seriously different showing driver license buy decongestant alcohol. 

You could even roll voter registration it, too! Tell grandma needs card social security medicare. Problem solved. least safe. part frustrating is, that's best do. [COVID-19 cases deaths fall UK, vaccinations fact turning masking moral ruler fucked up. new law created prohibit people wearing face masks pandemic.

Wearing mask conceal identity illegal multiple states. We're talking Michael Myers mask. one going arrested conservative states wearing face mask. Calm down.

http://www.anapsid.org/cnd/mcs/maskcodes.html read it. agree. conservative. even conservative guidelines pretty clear wearing masks outdoors situations. People Ny, times addressing likely, still confused guidelines acting even cautiously outdoor masks cdc advises. Thanks option random internet nobody 👍 think community spread lower. 

This exactly it. Vaccines help drive community spread giving us herd immunity. community spread down, people stop wearing masks. though, people judging others wearing masks? vaccinated make immune, lowers chances significantly, make immune. 

Where still pretty brutal 3rd wave. Sure, I'm vaccinated I'm still going pretty careful community transmissions drop significantly (which starting to). Whats problem taking extra month make sure we've stomped thing out? that's article about, it? Merci l'ami people distrustful vaccines entire world. majority even agree statement ""vaccines effective"". keeping masks Sept 15 might keep longer depends vaccines numbers. flu season though. substantial mortality savings also counted excess deaths. Numbers alone don’t tell story. numbers headed direction end last summer too, vaccines, everyone declared victory.

The numbers still high, September. Deaths falling slowly past several weeks. We’re way good place, there’s still ways go. Yeah April 19th slowest areas. Arizona live, vaccines available adults since March 24th - fully 7 weeks ago. vaccinated point, that's you. would surprise see kids uptake high elderly, especially require schools. Sorry, meant negative. blown away cleanliness, public transit, restaurants, many things Japan. Beautiful country lovely people.

I equally blown away utter failure conference banquet turned to. big table food middle room. lines organized system distribution. couple hundred people (maybe 1000?) real way get food back table. I've stayed home even tested positive Covid-19 symptoms. cannot know big wave open up. politician take risk? 
In Australia border closure incredibly popular political move. believe Pfizer studies deaths among fully vaccinated individuals. 

The Pfizer trial deaths placebo control group either. Again, zero control groups... people said vaccine 100% effective deaths. mean placebo two vaccine trials explicitly report hospitalizations efficacy outcome make latter issue clear. vaccine, one person control group severe COVID-19, eight people hospitalized; [Johnson &amp; 34 people placebo group severe COVID-19, five people hospitalized. It’s true zero vaccinated people hospitalized either study vaccines took effect. **But numbers small, can’t draw reliable conclusion high efficacy may outcomes. Diana Zuckerman National Center Health Research** [**pointed **about Johnson &amp; Johnson trial, “It’s misleading tell public nobody vaccinated hospitalized unless also tell 5 people placebo group hospitalized.”** She’s right. can’t confident predicting effectiveness precisely wider population outside trial, either. example, vaccine trials included relatively people older 60 participants.  see fragile numbers looking compiled severe disease. **In the** [**Pfizer example, one vaccinated person developed severe COVID-19 versus three placebo group—which meant single bout disease made difference calculated efficacy rate 66 percent one 100 percent.** trials, zero people severe disease vaccinated group versus one control group, adding subtracting one would even dramatic. **The problem even greater deaths. efficacy analysis, two vaccine trials—for Moderna’s Johnson &amp; Johnson’s—reported COVID-19 deaths control groups.** Talking clubs bars open. Keep up. literally used words ok lol. 

She said ""maybe variants coming countries, could start whole process again.""

A variant vaccine offer protection would essentially start whole process again. True galaxy brain thinking use IQ test rates defend misguided restrictions. 

Honestly, I’m impressed absurd take is. 

Bravo! really, know virus effects elderly CEV way young people, we've vaccinated 95%+ people, deaths really low. clearer, everything experts said likely happen, happening. Yep! correct, elimination COVID worldwide probably impossible unless world get serious it. Elimination populations definitely possible though. Countries even done without vaccines. need downvote me, herd immunity vague term include eradication well varying degrees protection. could argue herd immunity reached disease stops spreading. That's case now, we're talking loosening mask mandates people vaccinated, Dr. Fauci saying.

Once certain level people vaccinated, immunocompromised whatever think best. guess spell out, I'd say virus seem travel coach like rest us. spread via means necessary entire world - world. 

while yes, agree distance India Japan big deal, seem like would big deal something already reached every single country. 

so, since made really dig deep explain half-assed comment wrote taking poop morning, yes. distance India japan interesting talking point real point. real point 400k cases day India, India somewhere god damn planet fucking Olympics Japan multiple variants raising hell India. 

Perhaps, people can't seem let go protractors, said ""the virus touched whole world I'm sure problem transmitted means India Japan, way transmitted China New York City.""

Does soothe OCD? Would like harp distance places? matter, virus world. pandemic, distance matter virus part fucking pandemic.

Do say ways? Distance matter Covid-19 mutant variants already touched whole world. And, addition, right type, people dying India rate 4000 day mutant strain. Awful chilly Hell today think so.

Both availability demand vary lot region though. Especially since Pfizer 12-15 group fighting for. extra Moderna J&amp;J around help them. don’t think Fauci would’ve said wasn’t gonna happen. He’s extremely conservative reactions much happier 10tvs Facebook post   Yes, stands reason whatever measures prevented children dying flu also prevented children dying COVID-19; is, death tolls artificially depressed year. Much is, it. I'm sure they'll open everyone soon enough though. friend's kid getting Thursday. happy this. Yea I'm sure southern folks flocking north 4th revolutionary war matter anyone else doesnt want vaccine matter.

It matters vaccines help block transmission COVID happening mass scale get herd immunity. Well imagine people crossing border descending China, quickly turn no-covid China outbreak area. like style. Also, science land teenagers source spread? Like less likely spread first place, vaccination could percentage points less per person adult slowing spread. 

But data changed often know ended there. Name one thing Japan efficiently. make scientific you. 

Women weep, children flee hospitals murder fungi eats coronavirus patients alive inside There's people, like me, impact much besides saving ton money looking forward glad everyone getting vaccine hand hand people never aka anti vaccine people. hope fall projection September/October without masks end game anti vaccines people yes vaccinated masks think end game point long numbers go down. laughed loud. Thank Since tested positive

I though. 0 deaths England today... even among unvaccinated. 

Obviously vaccines really good, hard tell good people without protection even dying. I’ve fully vaxxed almost 2 months feels like eternity. closer herd immunity? daughter trial…..UNBLIND HER!! that's nation's independence largely fought won. northern colonies spend months convincing southern states join revolutionary war. would hope, I'm holding breath. I'm 34, still looking like first availability vaccination around first / second week June, looking booking dates. you’re vaccinated, pretty safe. small chance could get it, even would likely mild. That’s going happen Netherlands. said, since December I’ve seen single person store Netherlands without mask. person true medical exemption wear mask, person likely tell everyone sees people general accept it. Also have, know, large population centers like Philly, New York, Boston dc.... could it? Uptake 16-39 age group nowhere near 53%. It'll interesting see younger age groups better. think would feel crawfish.

Lol Virginia south anymore... know many people sc, GA, Alabama Tennessee going Massachusetts 4th better go beaches already have. talking snow birds they're south. India dropped US vaccinations per day last week, information early last week. America technically winning one right now, I'll give that. India's supply issues preventing hitting 3.5 million doses month ago. also happen third largest country world developed nation three, one's bit gimme. 

Israel around 60% population fully vaccinated already (both doses) course daily administration going lower. know argument here, US what.. 35%? Definitely losing metric, take months even catch Israel even stopped right now. 

Canada currently administering doses per capita US daily basis... regardless behind total vaccinations. That's metric, losing. 

The US best set parameters argument make best. per capita basis (which levels countries different sizes order make fair comparisons) best anything. 

Bonus point though, keep mentioning ""time reach immunity"" forgetting US never reach immunity. first dose vaccination rates dropping precipitously already (down 800k day) even 50% population coverage first doses yet despite vaccine available adult. state exemption reasonable accomodation providing accomodation poses unreasonable risk safety.  hell 25% people

Denial mostly imagine Expect another big bump us vaccinated people drag children in. that....

Yeah we're kind fucked. efforts Japan took early on

Eh? remember hearing quite opposite since last year start pandemic. even unvaccinated young person

Even high risk dying, still spreading likely die car crash

Yep. there's still huge pockets U.S. population coming receive vaccines (either 1st 2nd dose), main reason started exporting yet. 

They're still trying figure juggle conserving existing supply vaccine, much need keep making, get right pharmacies/vaccine centers - struggling that. 

Adding logistical steps exporting existing vaccines multiple countries actively still trying administer vaccines hundreds millions, would something nightmare.

And yet they're planning exactly - AstraZeneca vaccines, moment, hopefully vaccines Uhh - EU asking allow exports, donate free. 

Which corresponds going beyond / focus helping countries. Sure, they'd get paid service takes effort good get started first place / focus exclusively themselves.

And it. agree. I'd love nothing U.S. right thing start exporting Pfizer Moderna vaccines, least J&amp;J considering many Americans hesitant take 5-6 people serious side effects (out millions).

But saying ""America First, amirite guys"" idiotic, considering hard U.S. got bashed 1st 2nd waves.  Nobody drank bleach trust science behind vaccine?

We speak truthfully virus without diminishing disastrous impact lives society. SARS-COV2 particularly infectious. exists however particularly complex space society, deadly enough people lock house, innocuous enough ignore. rapid vaccinations would probably needed.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Yeah, vaccine. numbers vaccine, people giving vaccine credit getting us place we’ve already been.

Let’s see vaccines get us actually low case death numbers, ones haven’t seen before. Arm sore night got 2nd Pfizer shot shoulder little stiff next morning. Felt like million bucks afternoon went hike. dream alive American south Middle High School rough me, kinda/sorta get it, careful this!

Totally remote definitely ""just mean should"" thing... better worse, social interaction something everyone needs develop make things hard.

If stay online school, try join small in-person clubs/organizations find interesting! That's biggest BS I've seen long time! That's without social anxiety agoraphobia, partial income loss kids home. Well, ok maybe forced right term then. set measures allow achieve 90+% coverage. got J&amp;J. shot, took 4 shots went ham beer, felt okay next day.  ayy kaiser club. got 2nd shot thursday. gl :) I’d put money CDC lifting mask mandates fully vaccinated people, effectively ending mask restrictions. gave “The last us” type vibe I'm high school student would get it, classmates still reservations- I'd like able meet first time since March 2020 haha

Would appointments open pretty much right Wednesday?  trend indeed good, wonder caused trend up. Better vaccine messaging? Easier availability? Whatever past week, hope keep lol. better paid us right thing without needing bribe get vaccinated. hope don’t cancel 2021 BBQ cookout Nice see sizable increase compared last week. wonder last week anomaly so, I'd curious factors led big drop last week.

…take vote… Again, vaccine. vaccine. two situations aren’t comparable. National polls standard deviation result 2016. Even assume polls whether people want vaccine something absurd like 3 deviations, vast majority would still become solid majority. forced measles vaccinations. complete joke company is. 

Imagine unreliable 6 months mass vaccination begun, already studies mixing vaccine another one full shit production capacities nobody knows enough second dose. Holy shit pathetic. might due flu deaths reduced masks social distancing. don’t know though. They’re worse adults. Households teens tweens COVID spread. Get vaccine let's fucking party! Still laughing ass off? That's calling global vaccination else joke. discussed one press briefings last week today. April 26th mass deletion 10000+ cases caused Rt plummet actually is. deletions end, it’s caused Rt rise higher actually is. DOH Commissioner said actually .67 somewhere around there.  Here's scientific question. 30% reduction 950 deaths mean everyone 30% less dead? still lot people dying?

His analogy bad, made accurate one point out. Huge increase last week! wonder last week low Arguably Japanese government work though. move slow pace, organization key tenet governance Japan. effective system process worked out, typically run smoothly effectively.

Getting point requires lot cooperation - takes time.

The central governments main fault seems didn’t provide good framework state local government use distribute vaccine. result there’s several thousand local governments country wide struggling create systems - different supply chains, appointment scheduling applications, vaccine storage facilities requirements, etc. bit dramatic. thinking something like measles, course different scale. imposed plenty pretty bad things onto millions millions people, worst.  Seems incredibly dumb Japan's daily covid count 7000 compared zero New Zealand 600 Korea. I'm DC excited! We've strictest lock downs country. time. Tweens likely infect household members adults kids 10. Release Hulk India, win kids school open year person. cases covid community spread. game changer!!! fantastic news viruses circulation mutations... prevalent people virus. Think places like India, UK, South Africa, Brazil, New York, California... unlikely would Australia Vietnam variant.  think reporting inaccurate. 

It's get lot headlines reporting everything. get quotes doctors ""concerned"" variants. get headlines vaccine makers working boosters ""if needed"" variants factored in. 

Obviously none means current vaccine ineffective variant. still see quotes ""potential concern"" many people run real proven concern. least far isn't. [Worldwide COVID-19 Total Recovered Cases infuriating. complain covid measures refuse one thing actually end things complaining about. They've moved anti-mask anti-vax honestly. Ikr nonsense post 🤦‍♂️ Probably three years therapy first like Social skills damned! Yeah I’m one usually come Fauci’s defense, click bait articles insane. clearly said people might choose wear masks reporting FAUCI SAYS MASKS FOREVER. ""scientific method"" keep seeing people post about? course certainty many anti-vax people adamant never getting ever. people cause become recurring problem. course can’t mask lockdown forever. it’s soon still. Well won’t know see it. Regardless it’s least step right direction. article nothing wearing masks indoors even wearing masks prevent infection spread. last summer: back people thought wearing masks outdoors prudent—it isn’t; wasn’t vaccine last summer. mean considering Americans drinking bleach isn’t exactly surprising. know several people waited vaccine easily available without appointments. think shows many people waited easy get vaccinated. people like mom got appointment soon possible. Oh wow made day promising numbers. absolutely flabbergasted taking long. meeting Wednesday? seriously? move day 2? mean, c'mon people ever reason work lunch something...just sayin'... Yeah didn’t know fungal infections prior that, article confirms worst. mentioned people surviving COVID parts eyes face cut prevent infection spreading. don’t think India social safety nets needed take care people. gives lot perspective good US, badly need export vaccines medical equipment possible. enforce inconvenience. Nobody's knocking door forcibly injecting anything, danger society, force limit ways interact it. stay inside forever protest postpone olympics patiently waiting vaccines? That’s great! get one super spreaders toddlers? relief. way worried people nothing benefit people really kinda poopy for. Thanks this. 

I'll sleep better night 🙄 certainty? far hasn’t happened get perks retroactively? got 2nd dose month ago, want free beer lol could possibly make think vaccine might something people's brain?

Edit: totally miss read post. Sorry legally speaking, california, budget surplus gets big, half excess surplus needs spent education, half needs sent back californians. currently california way flush cash, think newsom said theres $76 billion budget surplus, $16 billion surplus limit, called gann limit, stimmy program satisfies law, also exceeds bit since new expansion gonna cost $12 billion, 4 billions mandatory 8 

that said, # job postings irrelevant. jobs dont pay enough, nobody want them. employers simply refusing raise wages reason son turns 12 end September. wish could get vaccinated sooner! wonder chose start age 12 11? Welp

I’m nightmares tonight wore mask outside lol? big issue 25% hold basically decision making positions. hard people 75% convince managers etc real issues going workplace everyone loves working home. Great progress. 5G resonates nano-antennas vaccine penetrates wall s
 
 think worry 5g barely That's pretty great! earlier better. perfectly healthy daycare workers refuse vaccinate even though take care babies young 6 weeks old. Selfish shitheads. Medical freedoms ass. ...Most people know who've significant side-effects got 8-12 hours shot. butta-faces busted grills flourished covid She’s immortal  days ago got Pfizer vaccine 11 am. didn’t feel anything around 4:00 pm little sleepy slight headache. also made sure stay hydrated. what? Let people keep wearing masks want to, cares live lives. blood 100% antibodies now. risk sounding racist, certain large minority group work almost always noses exposed. 

WTF? always think Cbus educated city read comments there. Total cesspit like rest Facebook Apparently pfizer \\\_0\_/ Thanks good know got chance hug mom. part true ""That process worked US well."" correcting saying ""in parts US"". Probably completely normal, definitely normal last year. Hang there. greatly over-simplified explanation designed make us feel good.

The fact vaccines *have* shown lowered-effectiveness vaccines. much could mutations lower effectiveness further? open question, simplified Redditor statements answer spike protein can't mutate *that* much

This wand-wavy statement scientific statement. actually *know* much antigen change allow still fulfill function yet become unrecognizable immune system.

It likely vaccines still retain high effectiveness variants, wise move already working boosters, developing generic platform vaccines built on, order able rapidly deploy new versions things change quickly. Last week Pfizer said [ages 2-11 mental health actually improved.  Including this? making happier.  kid need shot stop pretending over? There's many cases last summer. Thank you. It’s cumulative, need moving faster herd immunity, that’s slipping away. I’m not. genuinely didn’t know... I’m law expert international travel. edited.my comment, FYI. Trying transparent here.

The problem comment goes appeal authority rather what's true based evidence. keep telling tell someone something respond random email. seems like avoiding actually discussing this

Can admit placebo vaccinated samples deaths... misleading claim shows vaccine prevents deaths based that? Damn, that’s sad. yet   There's certainly mushroom complacency. guess test see get second?  overloaded Covid antibodies, possible? Vaccines EUA can't required. However, full approval happens children, agree many schools require it. hand, requirements may mirror community feelings things like mask mandates  way response request, info u/Charyou-Tree's statement. Even vaccine still requirement wear mask indoor settings. I’m sure middle schoolers would able mask setting younger school age kids would near them. Got J&amp;J jab today. light fever can’t sleep otherwise feel pretty good.

For long expect adverse side effects happen? Nice!  appreciate you’re trying get people vaccinated, hope understand take comment — can’t overlook people encouraging others break rules, matter positive impact may be. Sorry! Wow, that’s incredibly sad.  I’m sorry everyone there. Florida last state extend eligibility don’t even get ""experts"" school district Pennsylvania started signups contingent upon passing hurdles. happy means youngest soon eligible vaccinated. I’m 18 got second shot Pfizer days ago. didn’t really problems slight headache little sleepy usual. I’m sure experience little different everyone though. push people away getting vaccine 

Is media’s goal? it’s certainly working *Average* Sat/Sun/Mon raw metrics:

- Tests: 1,173,681 (-101,397)

- Cases: 29,601 (-10,372)

- Deaths: 436 (-59)

- Hospitalized: 31,367 (-760)

- ICU: 6,697 (-123)

(Tests/Cases/Deaths: +/- = change Sat/Sun/Mon avg last week)
(Hosp/ICU: +/- = daily avg chg Fri)

Source: amazing choice words. lot people died COVID would died something year COVID. show excess death.

That said, countries clearly much better job others accounting COVID death toll Oh God you’ve listened American Redditors blather much you’ve became one. Get life rather absorbed American politics can’t help bring irrelevant info gets dick hard repeat American progressive talking points. 

The one relevant thing said hand waving missed point. pre-register vote birthday voting day registration. jury duties pull voter rolls. I'm sure ways well involving things like taxes.

It's unlikely possible. plan wearing mask minute longer need to, honestly blame people keep wearing them.

I honestly feel like pandemic revealed lot certain types people. reason stimulus. ""disaster"" phase COVID over. less voluntary disease point given existence widely available highly effective vaccine US. Job posting extremely high levels. Anyone wants job get one. Indeed exact opposite problem.. nobody wants get job anymore make money living stimmy.  Awesome!!!! What’s next age group looking approval? difference make sensationalizes/exaggerates push agenda versus profit? still sensationalizing/exaggerating. Actually worse that. He's outright lying. alien

Explain, please. can't wait hear this. Yes win. Please tell update table. I’m sorry it’s made difficult you. hope increasing vaccinated population decreasing infection rates mean you’ll easier time soon. 
I guess mean is: someone wants keep wearing mask feel safer feel it’s respectful situations don’t know who’s vaccinated who’s not, free without harassment. (My family criticized strangers public wearing recently, even anyone interacting verbal attack) thing all. Kids consent fair number medical procedures - without parental consent. things require consulting judge. Others require kid 13 14 jurisdictions. 

Which good, apparently percentage adult population, well average IQ, possession offspring. paired lack belief science, kids need safety net. told family see get it. going argue anymore. visit, it, sorry grandpa, going see you. I'm leaving house going siblings got it. I'm vaccinated, carry mask entering indoor environments. hang around neck sometimes cannae fucked fold pocket it.


This headline nuts. It’s triple? there’s [the cat summoned jury think know fucked mum last night lmao I'm definitely saying he's perfect. least he's accessible public wont sensationalize/exaggerate profit. Noticed someone actually linked posted select option people receiving dose 1...it shows 20k people 9th, think might delayed might use different kind verification. Everything 5/6 later slightly different shade color, maybe everything complete? Well everything perfect lmao article says began clinical trials March 6-month 11-year-old children plan seek authorization September toddlers young children. Yay! Four days me. time birthday; I'm going backpacking! WTF went back work past month first time since last March, kinda afraid I'd work relearning socialize easier get back thought. problem number people getting vaccinated impeding progress. Florida, last year, lots posts death ""Pneumonia caused Sars-Cov2"" counted ""Pneumonia', ""caused Sars-Cov2"".   

This pandemic provide research material grad students, least decades. truth details would provided WHO’s weekly epidemiological update Tuesday. Well NZ govt agree. morning Deputy Prime Minister announced business summit borders re-open everyone vaccinated expect slow careful process beginning sometime 2022. feel like Moderna causes side effects Pfizer keep hearing/reading experience. anyone else feel same? glad got again, think might wait Pfizer! Let’s hope so. 

I absolutely zero confidence way Scotty handling vaccination (and quarantining) programs. 

He’s good photo ops Facebook updates though! Government dinosaur needs replaced details would provided WHO’s weekly epidemiological update Tuesday. $31,000 literally exactly $15/hr. Maybe lying terrible math? vaccine vapoware point. They're even making Astrazeneca look good comparison. I'm amazed stock completely cratered. Ontario within next weeks, hit... think 50% adults? going 1% day  issue? put mask go lol Lol! lol state unemployment doesnt run long time, federal bonus runs september. furthermore, aware, californias max unemployment payout $450, scales previous income, order get $600 unemployment total, salary $31k year, far $15 hour. idea accuse lying tho lol 12-15 year died covid? Deep South outbreaks summer

They one winter too. Alabama particular huge surge summer. It’s good bro. like tell story rare disease. people hear attention get. first got wasn’t even classified cancer, therapy leukemia. called cancer certain benefits lot patients couldn’t get cancer patients alone. reclassified, ton research opportunities opened new leads treat come son’s lifetime alone. I'm glad read possibly entitled manner providing facts based upon experience comment replying to. already covid? think issue comes businesses continue requiring even person vaxed think would good news them, actually. want left alone. actually speed testing. Full review requires 6 months data EUA not. FDA won’t approve data showing it’s effective age group, don’t expect September. probably effective hydroxycloroquine was, I'm guessing safer ingesting bleach.  $300 TOP state unemployment. fact lie try make point really speaks volumes quality argument. I'm medic Australia little wager start year *one-of-each* (AZ first, Pfizer 2nd) strategy would become standard. Yeah last summer worried exploding (which eventually winter) due still lack immunity, natural otherwise. cases running places spread. sad situation, Nepal well last month so.  understand. fight mom last week. won’t get vaccine asked visit. She’s high risk told won’t see grandkids either vaccinated. thinks I’m monster literally don’t want die us exposed her. Good news indeed! company shared data FDA expected submit EUA soon. help many people! worries. honestly hope mask wearing adopted widely even pandemic. 

Not necessarily every day around people thing, certainly “if someone household isn’t feeling well, wear mask around others courtesy don’t get sick” thing. 

On plus side, also make easy tell see someone cold wearing mask future, who’s selfish shithead without even talk them. that’s convenient bonus!

If allows people wear mask time’s blend background don’t want hassled hit public, power them. everyone assume they’re sick too, leave alone.  wouldn’t. People it. Nothing magically happens birthday there’s requirement prove age you’re 18.

Parents want protect kids. ultimately exceedingly low risk lie.  also provides heard immunity household members. Especially multigenerational household kids go school it’s big win getting vaccinated.

Not saying agree lying get it, understand people made decision. dont know much pay attention budget process thats already happening, things important debt, tho, like yknow, panini

Yesterday couple million shy hitting 1.3, think would failure hit 1.4 4 days. Hopefully, fingers crossed. Also... please papá Biden send us doses Mexico. doubt will. Regardless view vaccine, would unpopular decision actually enforce. backlash would massive even parents want kids vaccinated. Everyone interested already vaccinated. Everyone else antivax little middle ground it’s kind scary. best. easy circumstance, challenging decisions remain significant impact. Shame CNBC using term ""Triple mutant covid variant"". media biggest variant this; insinuating astrazeneca kill tons people perpetuating vaccine hesitancy. really - trying get son 2nd shot numerous place could get Texas - long 90+ minutes Austin. using website aggregated multiple different secondary websites, including big pharmacy chains etc. 3 weeks later opened up, guess half TX wanted badly enough go looking. That’s incorrect 👀 

I would surprised number 16 year olds gotten meaningful. meant projections. Thanks. I'm NYC friends excited this. want deal anti-vax people school. get closing fitness center removing shuttle bus. sound ridiculous. Google CDC Excess Deaths COVID. Top link dash board. Select “cause subgroup. (FYI, respiratory deaths include COVID19) Ah, cool! Thanks informing -- unaware one. I'm pretty things, one slipped rug me.

Good luck fellow test subject (I'm Novavax Phase 3 US)  said alternative restrictions. Thanks context. Looking back comment, see sounds much worse intended it. Hope guys get you’re needing vaccine. weird. 

I'm hair stylist I've clients hair well decade. always hugged hello goodbye. still hug me. never understood since beginning honestly. well within foot minimum 45 minutes. Touching you. hug it...? Please start podcast  Providence Therapeutics testing new mRNA vaccine Canada, yet fully tested approved, short funding, good results stage 1 trial. data lags ... they’ll start showing toward middle/end next week West Virginia something along lines. 
Offering people age 35 $100 savings bond get vaccine retroactive. need get children younger August. schedule that? Florida, son former cancer patient great immune system. It’s rare form called Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis (LCH) histiocytes (cells part immune system) get confused form tumors attack various tissues like skin bone even organs. first diagnosed one year old several relapses requiring years chemotherapy. He’s remission 3 years permanent damage part pituitary controls water regulation. COVID could really mess up. 

Anything triggering big immune response could trigger relapse. concerns vaccine this, feel that’s better risk take catching COVID itself. gets normal head cold, gets wrecked. 

 wife got second doses last week, 13 year old get soon, son eligible, he’ll get his. hope many people get it, get it. It’s better us, including people like son even importantly, can’t get vaccinations medical reasons. New yorkers supreme

Even idea modern monetary theory, economy going roaring right now. Might well use money pay liabilities reduce debt GDP basically bedridden. husband took day 2nd dose work 11 month old twins. I'm incredibly grateful way could good, even sufficient, mom day. Maybe you’re California retroactively use time (Covid sick time 80 hours) instead regular sick hours. Godspeed America Yeah eventually, mandating vaccines everyone life realistic all. really going make people show vaccine proof go grocery stores life. Cmon makes sense sad doctors warn people shit... France country long time measures primarily due gouvernements mismanagement after-lockdowbs, schools vaccination Parents attempting sue ban masks school. We've already lifted mandate county. 😔  Yep, that's told. find rant satisfying. couple Indian variants already confirmed inside Japan, thanks government literally nothing entries India. Oh wait, actually finally something... apparently extended 3 days quarantine “request” 6 days! Surely that’ll solve issue like magic! way, around 300 people entered abroad day following quarantine guideline all. Hmm, then? Right, sending warning email! gonna definitely stop them!

...Our government truly garbage. Mine too! un-blinding June 15. 

Pretty sure got vax (based symptoms - arm pain, felt crummy second shot) worlds biggest wimp. restrictions must go, point fda approved full. Plus put regular childhood cdc schedule. Even then, state legislature makes compulsory. watching aghast India struggles coronavirus, fearing long-running shortfall Indian-made vaccines needs help protect dubbed “pharmacy world”, India one biggest suppliers AstraZeneca vaccine COVAX programme help immunisation poorer India hammered explosive growth infections – accelerated, say scientists, new country recorded 22 million cases population 1.3 billion, death toll nearly quarter sending 60 million doses overseas, India announced end March delaying supplies countries works meet African Union’s (AU) health ministers held emergency talks online Saturday discuss vaccine gap. There’s also issue don’t want citizens die/get hospitalized even it’s stupidity. Maybe sounds like dumb reason you, consider seatbelt laws dumb? Sometimes State tries protect people themselves. 

Another reason ability travel internationally. trip booked go Hong Kong Taiwan next year doubt I’ll able go place taking forever vaccinate expect US get winter surge covid due dummies won’t vaccinate.  Inc (NVAX.O) Monday delayed timeline ramping COVID-19 vaccine production said expect seek regulatory authorization shot United States, Britain Europe third quarter 2021, sending shares Maryland-based company repeatedly pushed back production forecasts struggled access raw materials equipment needed make vaccine. Novavax shares fell 9% extended trading closing nearly 9% lower Monday. I’m fine downvotes. genuinely curious. don’t know anyone still completely locked down. it’s worth, I’ve Covid shots. nah. mask protect others deadly virus spreading air. Totally inane ramblings. idiotic governments give first shots even idea they'll next get deliveries. Either secure 2nd dose first, EU did, wait make sure reliable production source, UK did. Canada worst worlds, AZ's fault.  Damn wanted good stuff, none adenovirus modified proteine expression malarky, straight sars. Fuck shit wank. CDC data showing ridiculously low amount breakthrough cases real world, not? would say blend two realistic. Mandating covid vaccines life going cause lot issues people take virus seriously unlike others there. know, actually kill them. 

Your comment come disrespectful rude hence downvotes. read article article makes sense particular restriction getting scoffed at. saying general. always think picked best picture that. cat could understand happened think would pretty accurate. know what’s impacted mental health? inflation supply chain issues. world right feels like almost everything pain ass. don’t see masks major inconvenience, I’m tired too.  

I really want scream people get vaccinated put end this. Instead keep moving forward everyday, hoping best. attempting discuss ask sourcing, decide agree you.

That's fair point. supply source data thank you. change fact that, looking it, think poorly designed survey. However, made effort explain rather allowing come across carping unappreciative efforts. apologize. realize much butterface masks became thing. never got harassed dudes times, love upsetting lol. second sentence doesn’t prove first. It’s rather obvious add people
to household you’re going increase likelihood someone (and most/all family members) getting it. doesn’t mean teens/tweens worse spreaders adults. When? Compare Sweden neighbors. substantially worse rates similar countries. undoubtedly obvious would better results followed simple measures prevention. Good Yes now, socially distanced masked whenever possible. Contrary many believe, people still dying this. could anyone. spend year wife got vaccinated worrying day day would get it. wouldn’t even minded much got didn’t want get asthma. Similarly father array heart problems. people closest pre-existing conditions spend time watching everyone disregard rules stayed home hoping every day could make little bit longer vaccine comes out. long year. countries allowing population serve crucibles even virulent variants, we’re discussing airborne virus handily crossing borders, countries danger sounder policies. Imagine vaccine-resistant strain emerges (I believe happened). work hope naught, people dead. 

There objective measures truth here. see approaches efficacious clearly not. There’s data, it’s matter opinion. 

To put plainly, countries actively dangerous others, world needs act quickly. Hey, Hank already gotten first covid vaccine shot like 7 times today? girls cuter mask. I'm sure look better one too.   data coming shows clear reduction. increase taken place. small bit anecdotal evidence -- work outside 12ish hours day Georgia. *first* year I've *ever* got actually *sleep* night pollen season bc post-nasal drip giving nary problem. 

Idk science, but, personally, feel WAY better pollen season. fear bad feeling too. country one best phase 1 responses seems heading one worst phase 2 responses. interesting. mighty fallen. dad too. Cancer patients responding well it. would .04% chance testing positive. put together lottery winning odds. Hey know fellow r/Braves poster dont know got downvoted. Must anti vaxxers agree. know why, happening exactly say. Yeah that’s another thing. 4 months spent Southeast Asia didn’t see masks common except people riding motorbikes streets Vietnam. kinda chalked pollution wanting breathe smoke motorbikes, sometimes saw people wear masks street indoors people would normally pull take off. mainly Vietnam, didn’t see nearly many masks Cambodia, Laos, Malaysia, even Thailand. 

And even Vietnam, mask-wearing normal nearly common right covid, even close. think people sometimes wrong impression. Unless know something don’t know... Instead producing vaccine mass producing existing proven one . already production line setup . parents would actually let get someone works sciencey fields assure less children families church grew in... people believe ""Quiverfull"" Families i.e. they'll stop children God stops letting get pregnant. hope.

If means months wearing mask vaccinated person, fine me. Also even east Asia people keep posting wear masks time probably spent much time there.

Why use masks well ventilated facility *everyone* vaccinated? (The arent work us).

Our management sympathetic hands tied due state mandates indefinite masking requirements. couple ultra paranoid nut jobs still screaming requiring erroneous testing. FDA approves, CDC provides guidance, States individually interpret CDC guidance. Meshes cases could 10-20k per day. like it!

That's comment exists valid. Yeah, I'm sure agree disagree it. US, both! Tough noogies. turkey neck advertising. sports. Would even required point? I’m sure people choose don’t see requirement Nope, joined October date unblinding. I’ll wait advisory board approval Wednesday call. I’ve read appointments taken Thursday, hope don’t wait long.

IT'S BEAUTIFUL I’m Virginia tech student we’ve handled fairly well I’d say, don’t see next year bad, mean we’ve dealt year adapt soon anyway Flu shots common benefit US jobs. Like literally bring someone give shot anyone wants it. also widely covered insurance US tons people pop pharmacy it. stopped immediately, went month several reports people infected went back spread it. Madhya Pradesh alone, 99% attendees tested positive missing. People know stupid enough attend positive contacts. Get facts right. government religious leaders responsible, held festival first place. supposed next year oh yeah saw star signs brought forward. Look are. one top priests died others took things seriously told people crowd place. yet, holy baths continuing till 28th April. 

It's targeting Hindus. religious events super spreaders. one hand kumbh mela. hand massive gatherings Eid Hyderabad. retreat Catholic priests Kerala. name God, people murdered religious nutcases. 6 18 months now. Probably closer 6. viruses contagious vaccine still ruin peoples plans masks mitigate. No, I’m Phase III Pfizer trial there’s nothing afraid of.  need register vote order eligible jury duty. Got second vaccine early February workplace. stragglers since gotten shots.

Not masks required we're still tested weekly. literally like June 2020 workplace.

I mention though I'm Bay Area. Jealous people living sane places. Tactful tag “good news…” Aren’t vaccinated? Isn’t effective wearing mask? (It is.) mean, wear mask whatever reason want, you’re vaccinated you’re spreading virus community anyway, staunchly anti-mask people FL aren’t going inspired seeing another person mask isn’t mandate place going maskless part culture lot FL. I’m sure people done it. don’t buy it’s meaningful (in millions). Vegas too. think state rather good job roll-out. enrollment opened up, stupid easy schedule drug store across street days later. I'm like three days second shot. missing likely hospitalized elderly, higher rate vaccination; healthcare workers also mostly vaccinated. hospital systems overwhelmed past year vaccines lower natural immunity, doubt over-run half population vaccinated either. least hope not. I'm keeping it! four masks make panicky, two feel comfortable. worry looking crappy camera. People recognize me. Bros tell smile.

It's much better allergies. elementary high schools anything like universities, won’t able require vaccine long “experimental” designation, “approved” designation. It’s understanding covid -19 vaccines we’re getting (Pfizer, Moderna, etc.) right now. first Pfizer shot May 1 counting days May 22 second shot. I'm ready get dark cloud! Yeah op's comment screams arrogance lol I'm arguing majority Americans want vaccine, never said anything it. 

Just polls surveys reliable source. Like Wikipedia, usually really close good info, also get ones like New York Times prediction laughable.

I feel cheapens argument could used real numbers like amount people it, fact 1/3rd military members denied (as Feb) meaning 2/3rds want it. better platforms try convince majority US want it.

Saying ""Every survey says this, have?"" like saying ""Wikipedia says this, have?"" mind. discredits even correct. know who's shot, people least likely get ones refusing mask up.

I think mandatory vaccine full FDA approval. worry, answer ""nothing"" Seems like would depend answer.

That’s standard response everything though. doubt, blame foreigners. one forces wear shoes grocery store lol  misunderstood. Long COVID rates obviously proportional number cases, wasn’t relevant point.

Lockdowns restrictive public health measures infringe fundamental rights freedoms. Therefore, need justified. fact people die outright COVID suffer long term effects, likely also decreased life expectancy and/or prolonged psychological burden, justification suppressing spread COVID, addition infection fatality rate.

I actually opinion it’s uncomfortably ambiguous whether extreme lengths governments gone suppress spread covid justifiable. Net life expectancy would decreased somewhere 0.3 1 years per person, one average, let COVID run population.

You ask yourself, personally, would given year life expectancy order lived normal life last 15 months. know might have, can’t speak everyone; government does. fact long term effects prevalent gives credence public health measures.

I hope don’t actually believe lockdowns don’t work. look graphs: cases go up, lockdowns implemented, cases go down. Obviously work. That’s say aren’t ways suppressing COVID, that’s separate point. 25% people studied either denial, straight lying. gonna future, would appreciate report anti-vax comments see! zero tolerance policy anti-vax misinformation, it’s hard find offending comments people don’t report them! vaccines people want produced like 2 countries. surprise me. going really feel weird wearing masks indoors. going feel really weird first time I'm capacity concert sporting event bar.

Coming Western Australia like we're even speaking language here. Almost mass producing vaccine record time pandemic mass shortage supplies tricky, would've thought? 


Most vaccine companies issues producing vaccine, certainly norm. Impossible legitimately happen. would mean selected 17. 12-15 year olds 16 up... Poor 15 half year olds... can’t wait! kid 3. parents got shots giving hard time willing vaccinate kid.

* Texas (about 9% US) excluded CDC data, tables match national totals.
* CDC reports vaccinations 0-17 age group. 16-17 age group size derived 2019 Census estimates comprise 11.4% aged 0 17. Assumes 0-17 doses given aged 16-17. I’m sure Q anon crazies already it! get that’s fine. argument vaccinations younger kids “not many die” vaccines prevent death 100% time. 

As parent, take precautions can’t imagine parent loses child told someone else death acceptable. uh... yikes. need get recognize tone there. People vaccinated low enough risk able go lives. 

Depends much spread area. Cases low area, I'm ok things. 

But high-spread areas, vaccinations necessarily help enough go high-risk situations, imo. 7 day average positivity rate time low 3.2%. literally tho. leaves permanent damage organs even young healthy adults, fear justified. cant right. Bidan McDonald's teaming fight Covid 19. war since Bidan coming people's burgers? Lol should. Saw little bit post auto bot deleted it, you’re probably right lot anecdotal anything else.

My understanding per calorie macros could say expected world micros deficient. E.g. McDonald’s menu essentially void essential vitamins, almost fiber, they’re low amounts given caloric portion sizes.

Another good increase last week last week (monday/tuesday) saw huge decreases week before. Seems last week outlier anything else.

Not lot, sure wasn’t free.

And yes, insured. FDA better hurry approve vaccines (beyond emergency use authorization). Good luck enforcing otherwise. number much higher Meskwaki Nation***, officials estimate 70 percent eligible live work settlement fully vaccinated.  Again, agree children get vaccinated. refuse take seriously idea even single death unacceptable outcome. That's insane statement make exactly get frustrated people downplay virus death rates alone. lot gray area symptoms death. likely survive mean good, nothing worry about. cant wait turn political. Facebook vestigial point. pushing users platforms. 5G.WiFi.Update0.6969.inf thought Iowa one first. guess that's understand I've cracked many history books. Maybe try instead. believe Dr. Tam said 75% adults one dose 20% two. least that's global Canadians hoping summer fewer public health restrictions, 75 per cent adults need get least one dose the COVID-19 vaccine, according Canada’s top doctor, Dr. Theresa modelling showed possible “safe lifting scenario” warmer months means three-quarters Canadians need least one coronavirus shot. Twenty per cent Canadians need second shot.

Actually I've noticed sources saying PM said 75% too, rather 70% one has. [CTV watched presser tbh remember exact number gave. Whatever was, said doable summer based supply everyone eligible 2 doses fall (assuming go get guess). 🥳🎉 EXTREMELY unlikely get outdoors moving. Basically unless exposed someone infected considerable time period, get infected, without vaccination.

With vaccination, generally worry much. life pretty much back normal, bit masking. someone wants keep distance put mask normally I'll oblige, otherwise I'm basically post-pandemic mode. partnership sold exclusive vaccine rights AZ exchange money

Do source that? I've following whole thing pretty closely never heard Oxford sold rights Astrazeneca money. 

As far know, signed exclusive partnership guaranteeing AZ would produce vaccine cost initially, profit developed markets pandemic over. 

I disagree overall point though, retrospect would far efficient open licence whoever wanted produce vaccine.  education required licensing different state. California strict licensing us mental health, something I’m grateful for. similar worse countries incl. Germany. current speed difference days. day, CDC updates total number ""At Least One Dose""

Today, May 11, number 153,448,316. Yesterday 152,819,904. gives us 628,412 first doses reported today. open office concept sucks. hope never again.  couple things:

1. confuse [efficacy Efficacy also measuring infection rate. vaccines shown, trial, 100% effective preventing serious illness, hospitalization death.

2. time J&amp;J observed [90%-100% longer period time. similar numbers mRNA vaccines.

As non american: there's nothing wrong America first mentality, personal issue US definitely got supply right now, US applying around 20M doses per week right supply 70M, that's without counting 60M AstraZeneca yet exported. biggest problem still export ban raw materials make vaccines would increase global output fasten global supply chain, US would suffer anything lifted restriction. never much guys. 3 guys week already.

Hi, CDC recommends using NSAIDs unless medical condition preventing taking NSAIDs. see reason NyQuil would contraindicated, first make sure another reason can't take NyQuil. think kind unfair suggest ""America generous. nations aren't"".

Every country got hit hard pandemic last year. Lockdowns, medical supply shortages, etc, felt across globe. 

It probably true though U.S. historically better position help many different geopolitical problems virtue population relatively small compared vast natural resource wealth. know talking about... Hopefully US starts sending extra doses away 4.2M AZ actually exported US natural gas option, religious reason wood? real evidence gives stronger side effects -- mostly seem par other!

Three weeks Pfizer, four weeks Moderna US. countries, dosing interval vary depending public policy. believe AZ also 4 weeks.  heard today they're going start spreading rural areas Yup. always preferred American healthcare model that.

It obviously issues lower-income people, people decent jobs afford health insurance (which people), you’re significantly better Canada IMO figured sarcastic lmao Canadians weirdly defensive *3* weeks summer. Sure want pedantic double paying right now, insurance used pocket.

Free concise ""$0 pocket"" ""completely covered insurance"" chose say end day people care costs them, everything accounted nothing life free. Sure

Just call around see Pharmacy clinic nearby Pfizer hand. Im happy average went up. That's universal healthcare extra steps...  non american: there's nothing wrong America first mentality, personal issue US definitely got supply right now, US applying around 20M doses per week right supply 70M, that's without counting 60M AstraZeneca yet exported. biggest problem still export ban raw materials make vaccines would increase global output fasten global supply chain, US would suffer anything lifted restriction.

Stay angry little buddy. studies read referencing: Israel IDK people, like needles either, fact, related note, literally pass see much blood. 

I still got vaccinated first opportunity, cost/benefit brainer. Medical professionals also even blink ask minor accommodation like getting stupid countdown sometimes like do. weak excuse best eyes. hope so, doubts. Last year saw drops last spring combination lockdowns spring weather facilitating outdoor activities, northern states stayed low summer (kept lockdown measures outdoor activities), southern states saw waves summer (lockdown resistance heat driving people indoors). north continued drops summer weather vaccines, wonder happen South much lower vaccine rates (One dose: Vermont 62%, Mississippi 32%) go back indoors A/C.

Hey! include Louisiana there. work hard 47-50th spot depending we're measuring. may interesting track 12-15 separately bit watch uptake. idea. Cool. Let's get 1,000 cases day. US would prefer people took vaccines. still hundreds millions people unvaccinated, states trying come new incentives get people come in. like we're sitting vaccines literally can't use. easily browse hundreds posts state basically work. Same! Considering AZ sent vaccines EU UK willing deal potential EU lawsuit rather delivering less UK, I'm sure UK complains much.

AZ's HQ UK. bet hard cash UK gov behind AZ's decision ignore contracts EU &amp; everyone else. UK operates.   Oh shit get now. job, surprising health department hire people spew bullshit threads lmao r/unexpectedpulpfiction think people overstating much protection vaccines directly give them.

Basically, mRNA vaccines give people 1/20th chance getting COVID vaccination, things equal.  words, 20 people bar would gotten symptomatic COVID, everyone vaccinated 1 would.

But going bar 20X likely give COVID anything before. words, I'm protected staying away bar without vaccination, going vaccination. people never think way.

It's even worse variants. vaccines efficient them. example, 75% California variant. means 1 person would get instead 4, else equal.

The REAL protection comes vaccines slowing spread circulating much. That's already happening many places. whopper? terribly sad people around world desperate get vaccinated yet America get vaccine walmart drug store many places. time, day night, 24/7 pretty much now.

And going waste people brainwashed early covid here. People dying hundreds thousands chance vaccinated around world 30 percent Americans can't bothered take them. Maybe help Boomers anti Vaccination lose weight

Be consistent agree, play devil's advocate, *would* confirm exposure walking briefly past random stranger street? registered January eligible April, that's got first dose. really state-dependent.  Exactly. anti maskers need start acknowledging risk exists, lockdowners need start acknowledging every mitigation measure carries cost. 

I sure wish adults running world. also initial viral load infection. large Covid, viral particles quickly dissipate outdoors, especially kind breeze. Personally, cross side street. 

I still get nervous passing people times, anxiety centered around illness anyway.

I wish best health!  wrong peak reddit lol

AMERICA BAD might dumb question, why? would think would able get plenty people vaccinated well that, right? What’s reasoning behind this? wonder economic mobility. Poor kids’ families couldn’t afford private tutors. couldn’t afford switch private school public schools wouldn’t open. likely don’t parent home day supervise learning.

I bet we’ll see kids white collar class mostly make interruption 2020-2021. Poor working class kids got screwed—even usual.

Not get political here, bothers long-term school closures championed people usually vocal educational disparities based race, socioeconomic class, disability, English language ability, etc. people needed help got educations derailed. Movement.

I moderna, Pfizer neck arm stretches really helped. 10x population Mexico country 30% bigger size, it’s bound happen trying suggest good thing many people got COVID?  living “cut nose spite face” culture. don’t want Mcdonalds vaccine information unless they’re willing slate company coffee cups too, they’re never going end result you’d prefer wouldn’t bother altogether, potential good exercise never seen. 

I see facets life now. something isn’t done way want, people would rather kick scream burn house revenge cherish anything positive. know people said going bother getting shot change anything. 

These people think COVID hoax. take seriously. wear masks indoors social distance. wearing masks outdoors (because know risk transmission small). see CDC saying ""Good news everyone! vaxxed go outside without wearing mask long alone!"" roll eyes, they've already months. 

What CDC needs say ""Good news everyone! vaccines safe effective. vaxxed d**o whatever hell want**"" many 12-15 year olds brought covid home families?  clear vaccine hesitancy D/R voting state though. smaller republican states (like WV dakotas) really well initially, also opened groups earlier states. started strong simply ran willing enthusiastic people earlier. may still possible win people incentives mobile vaccination clinics etc, clear lining get shot way people New England are. all. Less people would it, total immunity would lower. would less deaths. biggest impact mental health came realizing people assholes refuse even wear mask. I’m much bitter days. fully approved schools able require it. Bad troll idea CDC might say vaccinated people won’t need masks? Even guess? 

I’m impatient need something think about, lol 😩 That’s honestly surprising hear, seems like guys well flattening curve early pandemic. hope manage get vaccinations going soon.  Israel New Jersey different budgets. US, every state way handling things infrastructure place. jesus, that's dark assessment. 

it's genocidal communist dictatorship. quibble racism, go ahead wipe folks like.

Insane.  I'm sure question. probably *should* been. Instead, everything either categorized perfectly safe insanely risky. tell opening things like schools gyms risk, instantly suspicious. start conversation much risk appropriate weighed benefits places open, reasonable compromises made.

Tangent ahead: 
Especially people lucky weren’t sick virus. sister lucky symptoms 3 days said felt like sever cold. knew corona father tested positive week that, pre pandemic times might went work symptoms. Idaho 70% 2010 believe gone significantly. 

There lot factors involved, like politics significant. percentage children 12 there? Hitting 70% adult population isn’t hard. Lots states US done that. 70% total population isn’t likely 20% population isn’t even eligible. Gotta get sweet, sweet clicks  Well, country is? Besides China. Awesome. keep lowering vaccination rate increases. signs Israel really promising. think fact one first get vaccines sufficient steady stream followed offset anger may occurred. Especially can’t doesn’t exist - months ago vaccines werent expected appear year.

It’s hard angry vaccines uk moment. mean continuing wearing mask public vaccinations good etiquette. plenty people aren’t vaccinated still want wear masks, think everyone else isn’t don’t either.

But inside home, private gatherings, outdoors don’t see vaccinated people would continue wearing mask I'm genuinely surprised someone gone postal corporate leadership yet. gonna anywhere requires vaccines gives perk vaccines bars (free beer) stadiums (free tickets). care health much know pandemic rages on, risk closed limited capacity etc. There's absolutely way single businesses would anything related vaccine affect bottom line, they'd stay it.

If eligible February, would gotten shots now. eligible back then, register. transparent lies. can’t really assume it’s purely exponential decay rate 0.5 though. number vaccines increases linearly spreader events happen sporadically. seasonal factors coming play it’s warming Canada recieved 11.7 million vaccines EU, Mexico recieved 7.9 million. 100 million vaccines exported EU.

Of course one gives two shits US exporting measly 4 million vaccines.

(Numbers taken article:) That’s works, doesn’t spread places you’re there. need get  evidence work like every vaccine though. You’re spot “excess death” check sure ballpark official count. 

And people say COVID even higher since didn’t 50k usual flu deaths... honestly people would died normal flu season ton overlap succumbed COVID

Anyways... you’re spot looking reasonableness check looking 2020 COVID deaths vs 2020 Total population excess deaths great way go Flights still operate US citizens, LPRs, imited excepted categories people enter US they've present India within prior 14 days. passenger traffic significantly reduced. everyone, including admissible passengers, test negative flight US. areas I'm guessing. Go check. Glad shit like continuing pay garbage wages. That’s false. numbers coming from?

We need stats. Ah doubt doubt. Oh totally get that, irony top notch. McDonald’s doesn’t care health, care business bottom line. Biontech/Pfizer definitely start problems. Shipments local docs get reduced severely without prior notice even. Also, basically take make vaccines. enough raw materials support another big manufacturer.

I think that's pretty sad, especially live close HQ. built several new, massive buildings covid research promising (and got heavy funding, including Gates foundation). Would nice boost region could finally take don’t time energy massive discussion this. think understanding R0 might fundamentally flawed. R0 constant. calculation R0 uses real-world data, resultant number really valid population wave (or lull) mitigation measures. 

R0 reproductive ability disease given population, dependent characteristics population. 

The R0 Sweden different R0 India. R0 lockdown different R0 fully open. 

Further cannot properly compare R0 diseases reasons. 

Measles could lower R0 applied mitigation methods it. Smallpox might ended lower R0 covid.

That’s get using Reddit first thing morning. Japan? Absolutely

Japan isn’t great comes COVID. Rates rising, political turmoil, Olympics. One highest number anti vaxxers world per capita... things aren’t rosy there

And yeah, vaccination rollout awful. 1%... jesus christ. get you’re coming from. past year, we’ve dealt virus government massively extending reach lives. spokespeople used alarmism lies—not science—to justify public. Much mainstream media taken side. Ineffective security theater stayed place long we’ve proven doesn’t work—see recommendations surface transmission outdoors masking.

With said, got vaccinated, think everyone able should. seeing data mRNA vaccines, trials real life, they’re safe effective. (If want good case study Pfizer vaccine, look entire nation Israel.) side effects temporary immune response. happens vaccines, too. evidence long-term issues like infertility—plenty women gotten pregnant taking vaccine. Getting second shot Modena tomorrow. one thing. Lockdowns, fear, misinformation, information-overload, mixed messages, political bullpoop, anti-science movement, etc. Mental health already decline, pandemic accelerated this. health information food next That's true. want hand people lump sum money asking 3 months.

Then again, logistics sending monthly checks debit cards might tough IRS logistics. pros cons both! mean 2 weeks second vaccine dose mRNA. vaccinated. Truly unfortunate. We're 46% vaccinated, point still stands. prepared get booster fall. 2.0 million week month, 2.5 million per week starting next month. Canada wanted U.S.-made doses months ago, already got it. That's Novavax though, CureVac wonder kind burial cremation sites full unavailable? Much US wasn’t real lockdown, “shitshow” Reality hurts it? really find surprising UK mad, given AZ also underdelivered them.

We prefer help rather sue them. way EU behaved pharma ever going vaccine cost again. huge implications next pandemic. New Jersey big budget Israel? New Jersey poor?

Why would budget even matter? I'm pretty sure enough buy vaccines wanted prioritize it. annual budget 45 billion dollars approximately. would taken less 1% vaccinate everyone. 

Your argument make sense. Interesting. you’re saying transmit air droplets, mask helps prevent droplets going (which MAIN form transmission) could still airborne separately droplets? 16% population aged 0-14 based population stats found

I'd estimate 13-14% aged 12 based breakdown saw given 4-5 year groupings Agree, even sure commented. article’s metaphor “abstinence only” rather harm reduction pulled focus wrong CDC messaging. Good journalism. course one gives two shits US exporting measly 4 million vaccines.

Because America getting started. Large numbers going magically happen snap.  IMHO sort thing CDC determining. people able rationalize. Ugh can't read! I'm saying ""30% != Basically Stable.""

Every sentence I've sent simply making fun you. deep position SARS-COV2 infectious diseases mentioned originally mistaken. position knowledge existence super spreaders somehow diminishes otherwise effective vaccine strategy would also say mistaken. 

If contending R0 measurement includes mitigation measures would say, often not, R0 values calculated population actively avoiding transmission case SARS-COV2 never would useless due large scale transmission mitigation activities employed around globe. local “R” rate R0. different wile R0 isn’t everything also isn’t useless. tell us sort vaccination uptake need avoid continue social engineering measures. good news, estimated R0 substantially lower many diseases managed control good vaccine strategy (and less effective vaccines). promoting single shot McDouble? little doubt vaccines things get better - global part ""Global pandemic"" far over.

The reality that, people, global impact going small effect personal lives. Tuberculosis kills hundreds thousands people year Westerners think anything it, you? depressing reality. individual community, job get vaccinated that's it. people want still live like March 2020, guest. I'm actually surprised anyone surprised this. since ppl look CDC guidance? CDC advisories basically useful state public health authorities turn to. even individual state governors decide press forward re-opening regardless science. Instead criticizing CDC cautious slow messaging public health ""experts"" need start brain-storming guidelines states bleeding edge reopening. Whether aggressive testing watch surges, increased PSA/marketing encourage higher vaccination rates, even increased funding/grants HVAC filtration upgrades public commercial areas, important pro-active steps health advocates initiating, rather carping &amp; complaining. I'm saying time lift export restrictions.

The U.S. already lifted export restrictions two weeks. already agreeing send 20 million AZ vaccines raw materials India shipped millions Pfizer vaccines Canada. Ok, happens (it's case many places right now), think point on, spread stay static continue go while? nobody point get vaccinated? iPod NanoChip®️12X dropping Fall!

You're literally three times many people dead per capita. 

You'd pretty stupid think current vaccinations better less deaths overall. What's even interesting many European countries obviously progressive us chose prioritize keeping schools open much possible. goes show easy decision exactly modern day pandemic playbooks. According census 2018 ~17% Canadians age 17, I'm sure current numbers are. 

I presume meant 70% eligible Canadians though since press conference said able based supply. 56% Republicans getting vaccinated, vaccination rates high older age groups? groups overwhelming conservative? Also, vax rates pretty shit among 20s overwhelmingly liberal. think lot older Republicans getting vaccine even admit it. gotta love despite providing unhealthy food sponsor tons sports, fund facilities ill children’s families, promote covid vaccines. It’s strange hey good them! I'm sure they'll split it. spend once! Get free Java Jab. great. Thank you. say today. said anyone could walk drug store get vaccine wait. technically.. Americans hate masks much declared prematurely covid around long time. we'll vaccinated annually many probably get shot too. Teach em Zoonotic Diseases next think cases higher month today US? time went got sick True. Maybe getting large employers would enough get us threshold. think largest private employers European, could definitely see requiring it.

None perfect.

Ignore problems, keep getting worse.

But hey, go way pretend nothing wrong. Masks provide protection true airborne transmission, effective droplet transmission, thing (even though droplets travel air). many times y’all gonna post goddamn article cases way down, yes. freaking mountain still climbing it. extremely high case load winter, last year really, means vaccination effort slowed.

Isreal UK case counts used comparison, adjust vaccination rates see talking about. accomplished hard lockdowns height peaks winter, along massive vaccinations. USA one, other.

If start lower level, vaccination campaign much effective. mean hate piss everyone's parade, article said nothing vaccines still fully effective. contrary doctor says evidence may able evade current vaccines testing needs done.

Finally good news Mexico. Shocked. Mismanagement first weeks vaccination hardly relevant now, limiting factor vaccine quantity 

If we're talking crucial first months securing adequate supply vaccines properly structuring every nation's vaccination program, yeah sure heck relevant. 

For good things say Biden administration, awful things (and should) say Trump administration, U.S. half well massive push ramping production capabilities designating right vaccine candidates happened Fall Winter last year. laid groundwork Biden capitalized producing thankfully great results think AstraZeneca production ever halted? 

You're right, misspoke - *usage* halted Netherlands April. [And goes multiple places across Europe.

Which again, part reason getting pissed States kinda pointless. live DC call every two years. guess crime per jury pool rate high.

The exception knew wife reason never got called despite living DC 15 years. (I lived four years got called twice.)

I've pretty lucky. moved VA DC, got notice grand jury months long ordeal already moved DC. show DC wait day get chosen trial. moved back Virginia got notice DC already moved good.

I've chosen twice county NC.  call day system said go in. second last year cancelling trial dates due COVID. check back month. highly doubt outdoor masks still required  rating also takes account test positivity. county test positivity 10%, penalized level. result, Michigan ""extreme"" even though case rates would put ""very high"" rating. Test positivity updated weekly basis average positivity whole week. state recently dropped 10%. see precipitous drop risk either week next week Michigan test positivity falls 10%.

Something similar happened South Carolina back January. severe outbreaks, downgrading risk takes longer testing criteria.  vaccines 100% effective.

Good news: US - numbers declining, 7 day average deaths around 650 falling. Israel UK well, vaccines starting impact Europe - still excess 60,000 new cases yesterday.

Bad news: India - thik continue bad news possibly end year - problem huge population logistical difficulties. Winter Southern hemisphere - last year ""worst 10"" countries, per capita, mainly South American - expect numbers soar next month two (similar US European surges Autumn/Winter) last year.

There little doubt vaccines things get better - global part ""Global pandemic"" far over. Duh doy. mistake.

I think complicated making be. US government *actively limiting* international trade right -- stop messing market, biotech companies pursue normal exports shipping companies etc. like US government actively manage there's still huge pockets U.S. population coming receive vaccines (either 1st 2nd dose), main reason started exporting yet.

Thank EU corona passports rolled least June, expect international travel go wide open then. NANOMACHINES, SON! think consequence public policy organization, whose recommendations lot impact population's behavior.

A recent publication Lancet (Source: ) found reduction cases 47% (CI 17-66%) weeks 1-2, 85% (CI 71-92%) days weeks 3-4 first dose Israel's mass vaccination campaign. main point paper short term, safe delay second dose countries scarce. But, show protection gained early-on.

I think bigger thing though, nobody talking about, comparison masking. Cloth face masks 67% effective reducing spread virus (source: ). So, vaccinated people personally protected well would mask.

But argument masks never protecting - always protecting vulnerable. terms protecting others, UK recently found (source: ) 3 weeks first dose, vaccinated person 38-49% less likely pass unvaccinated person. 4 weeks, number goes 60-65% - pretty much effective mask.

Unless I'm fundamentally misunderstanding probability works (or studies get trashed peer review), implies much factual basis requiring vaccinated individuals wear mask (aside choice, course).

The CDC almost certainly aware this, intelligent (and experienced) people head. important remember end, they're public policy organization - consider consequences recommendations. example, acknowledged well-protected first dose, lot people would skip second dose (which shouldn't, that's confers long-term immunity). think right now, they're worried drop mask recommendation, lot *unvaccinated* people would use excuse ignore guidelines, potentially causing small spike cases, would hurt plans re-open 4th July, increases risk new variant emerging.

That said, personally, think point, anyone wants vaccine US access one, time seriously consider dropping mask recommendations vaccinated, leaving personal choice. ""you need mask protect others"" argument seem hold facts vaccinated stage pandemic. Yes, they've run wood cremations. felt tired got shot, like sun day. Took nap went away. arm hurt week.

That sum J&amp;J side effects. Congrats. Yes, aware people vaccine can't really read? This. Vaccines widely available. local pharmacies advertising walk shots now. get sick, that’s getting it.

Time reopen everything. violation rights, could definitely make case ethical good government. got ton shit lot media. forget major point. mass produce need production capacity. EU paid capacity reservation fees secure capacity produce doses estimated AstraZeneca. end AstraZeneca provided two plants EU theoretical maximum capacity way less 300M/6 months. Even increased capacity, currently pretty decent yields sites Belgium Netherlands spitting less half original estimate. 

AstraZeneca greatly reduced commitment couple months ago said wants commit deliver 90M Q2. EU basically saying accept lower commitment filing lawsuit make sure keep commitment. you, dog. you. Sorry feel way . Oops. Beat it. [And thought messaging CDC guys reach 70% vaccinated finished restrictions.

Germany 1/3rd total population now, 34% adult population. This. Way 2: Super spreader outbreak dies relatively quickly others much, any, spreading.

I think reason took long disease spread outside China. We've found evidence COVID-19 present France, Seattle, probably lots places December, January February 2020, yet end seeding widespread infections. probably due travelers Wuhan infecting handful people never led super-spreading event, cluster died out. Probably American citizens’ babies, venture guess. Saw something Atlantic ago likened covid spread series chain-reaction explosions rather slow steady advancing.  dynamic attributed super-spreader dominant transmission. Limiting large gatherings thought key breaking chain. LOL, fucking martyrs around here. need wear mask, chances getting covid transmitting others extremely low. 16 year old pass mall walking going get you, promise. need vial deionized water people see complacent today probably since day one. recent spike cases area occurred verge awash vaccine supply. Unfortunately spike, ""plateau level"" new cases seems doubling. Still lots restrictions Schools- distancing, masks, limited extracurricular activities. Kids restricted school anywhere else life (for part).  really surprise? absolutely it. know longer reason wear it, spent last 14 months berating everyone taking seriously claiming wear mask rest lives help reduce common cold cause that's much care everyone else. Meanwhile real world think everyone know done mask. chance get vaccine now, time masking rules start fade away. reason edited title, OP?    Maybe r0 4, median likely way 2% cases hold 90% virus. Seems like either barely spread spread 50+ people Vaccine misinformation EVERYWHERE. YouTube looking video Pfizer vaccine top 50 comments first one clicked people claiming personally know someone died taking vaccine. Even one comment would come ridiculous, fact virtually every comment repeated lie absurd. I'm big 1st ammendment guy, social media companies crack nonsense. everywhere lot people completely bombarded lies never even hear actual facts. Expanding production capacity key material happening, shortages components raw materials huge issue moment. 

You might want set line certain vaccine component, machines required make component lead time little production capacity make machines make component. 

In short, supply certain components materials short months come globally. underestimate level crazy people. Ever heard q anon? think dumbest shit. uk variant: Royale cheese ""Big Mac league Big Pharma!"" vastly underestimate science deniers , worst part Russia China actually biggest winner Vaccinations campains far. 

I mean since Trump made clear 2020 vaccines manufactured US used mostly domestic population , one ordered US ( EU UK would easier order US actually build local capacities) . India smart enough install political control vaccine programms , EU didn`t , every rich country ordered EU, place left big liberal marked vaccines. EU sleeping early , US India already hording materials vaccine production. India back crises mode doesn`t export anything, US still exporting little (and still many countries order direct US) thanks DPA EU struggling manufactor supply export vaccines.. 

Now choice fast supply many countries rely China Russia use massive political influence. India looked like winner well , 2nd wave came. Actually, Japan drastically changed period. Japan late 60s lot closer May 68 Given virologists epidemiologists think herd immunity slipping away states vaccine hesitation, say go full WWII this. Put public awareness ads anti-disinformation propaganda every damn thing sun. MacDeez th new Internet Explorer 9 71. Fuck police. Defund. Either Pfizer Moderna, 2 approved Singapore moment. Except doesn’t cover overdose deaths despair spiked last year.  true covid, but, ick. plenty reasons this. Ugh. need. Another social control vector data mine. People need push back this. get vaxxed, it’s also nobody else’s business do, live, social security number is, fingerprints are. hope health official reading British Columbia, Canada. insists schools safe low transmission. isn’t case. That's interesting, thanks. I'm mostly surprised see homogenously uniform rating across state, especially since state uniformly ""extremely high risk"". situation significantly worse elsewhere weeks ago kind bias data reporting testing rates? Yay! Every. Fucking. Day. cops news! #D-Fucking-Fund That's outdated info.

Over 1/3 amongst ""fully vaccinated people."" Majority got Sinopharm. Agreed true, honestly find encouraging seeing big drops across US despite really locked anymore.  Australia expecting keep borders closed till mid 2022 health minister expects travel restricted years. went sign nephew Pfizer dose got message go CVS website: 

""Coming soon: Pfizer-BioNTech expected receive emergency use expansion COVID-19 vaccine include 12-15 years old. Check back details.""

Yeap, nope, got Netflix. Actually many EU countries similar rates germany: space that? don’t remember New York subway stations big enough accommodate that, especially kind privacy. actually test lot people, know, might fatal side effects too. test 1000 people, might well miss fatal side effect affect one every 500 people. actually dangerous COVID population.  certainly that, thank you. Japan quite literally twenty times fewer deaths America, that's ""worst example"" east Asia America absolutely fucked proved point. Relative vaccination rate matter people dying first place. look America like America looking India, let guys get vaccinated first humanitarian aid situation. Health Minister Martin Foley dashed hopes countless travel-loving Aussies, claiming today “every indication” international borders could remain closed “for years”.

Just mildly ridiculous. Wasnt UK health official saying something similar lockdowns? Uber driver wrong masks outdoors part - order issued May page b) People leaving residences must continue strictly comply Social (Physical) Distancing requirements stated Order specified guidance, protocols, orders established County Department Public Health. **This Order, beginning June 19, 2020, requires persons wear mask nose mouth whenever leave place residence contact walking near past others non-household members public private places, whether indoors outdoors**. includes wearing mask patronizing business, except explicitly permitted differently. Persons engaging social activities public settings must also continue follow requirements, including avoiding crowds, avoiding poorly ventilated spaces, covering coughs sneezes, washing hands using hand sanitizer frequently. Wearing mask reduces risk transmission others people symptoms know infected. Wearing mask protects others well you. Masks work bestwhen everyone wears c) Fully vaccinated people2 engaging social activities public settings must also continue follow requirements

Mostly old folks retired. Putting way, country is:

2nd best education

2nd best healthcare

2nd best crime

Then country likely ""best overall"" combining three factors (assuming ones play country occupies top spot three).

Obviously US best things mentioned even things mentioned - near top them. - combined sheer size population called - makes US among best, best, vaccine rollout date.

I know many others think get internet points shitting US, alright also admit succeeded beyond others capable of, thus far. assume would less contagious, allowing us basically kill could ever so. someone correct I'm wrong.

Unfortunately, covid stay long time. fairness UK advising anyone 40 given AZ shot. clearly feel risk reward younger age groups. might seen source total vaccines. i.e. Canada given ~21.5% total vaccines needed complete coverage per Bloomberg here: would correspond enough doses 43% population reality like 3% fully vaccinated, 39% one doses (36% 1 dose, 3%ish both), 61% doses. daughter get one. son 11 12 September. That’s whole family unit. family still hard lockdown around us party like it’s 1999. can’t wait things we’ve waiting for.  Force get tested weekly.

Pretty smart. FYI I'm also nurse I've seen 2 patients die yes much older went lot patients variety differing age groups well. units state/region person worked drastically change personal experience go through.

Take example serious flu infection geriatric population; hospitals take flu season seriously well. Yes Japan literally sitting tens millions vaccines. Use google fuck's 29% [parents said kids get right away. definitely get time though.

But even +300k doses per day, look first dose numbers (Which think ultimately important, since provides adequate protection return second), takes us around +830k/day +1130k/day increase 36% missed point.

The point virus spreading much there.

Now, one way vaccines protect people - reducing spread. 

But complicates accurate measures individual protection compared unvaccinated control group, trying measure here. Yes said key difference:

Like said nothing like sitcoms TV, discovered 100 new scents 1st day every corner peoppe tried selling us weed. subway ghetto af would never get vaccine lmao normal situations February month elderly depressed. deaths February followed announcement Covid19 March. Since world lost many patients due virus. like see countries state Covid19 deaths. vaccine must helping. Still waiting injection #2. basically look isreal handling variants? Depends. states control way administer vaccine. government nothing order some. (The states order well).

In state (Georgia) set vulnerable got time get shot first, could set appointments go hope available (lots places got it, doctors offices Kroger supermarkets). father would go local supermarket ask spare appointments done, eventually got it. got mine similar way, walked asked some. weeks people eligible, more, basically open everyone.

At point want vaccine pretty easy get it. people dont usually arent much risk dont care. 

Keep mind done state. One pound per person, time take grandma everyday. masks prevent giving others.

A vaccination would help prevent spreading COVID others much better mask would. news water wet🤭 Thing is, providing party dozens people home, fine. Nobody going go crazy there's 10 people home instead 6. keep behaviour little bit sensible everyone rush go crazy first week cause giant spike. CDC rounded 0.1% 10%? What's couple orders magnitude?

There's ""caution"", ""abundance caution"" ""paralysis caused wildly exaggerated sense actual risk""... allergies? allergies cause post nasal drip, means mouth breathe night makes throat sore. allergies make drowsy. sound like flu, sure (that'd chills, headache, fever).  Yeah, received first alert traffic Lincoln Tunnel due general volume traffic Sunday. seen since pandemic. What’s funny this? Sounds like need therapy UK - 1,871 deaths per mil

US - 1,792 deaths per mil

Israel - 693 deaths per mil

Seychelles - 283 deaths per mil

Naturally acquired immunity much factor towards stopping spread unvaccinated people vaccination is. Though think less effective vaccines another contributor. No, R0 basic reproduction rate assuming individuals population susceptible infection absence disease transmission interventions (masks, distancing etc). Sometimes see R0 calculated without controlling disease transmission interventions useful SARS-COV2. data R0 tends use early Italian Wuhan data sets people started taking social measures avoid infection.

Rt (or simply R) reproduction rate point time accounts various measures people take immune population. many governments share people weekly track virus.

The reason raise able contain virus' R0 probably best way comparing infectiousness have. perfect, know SARS-COV2 infectious many diseases control vaccines alone. good. means efficacious vaccines good inoculation take enough prevent uncontrolled spread populations. managed infectious diseases. place potty wash up. Got second around 10 week mark, sore arm slight feeling unwellness next day it. public decides is, already seen right issue forever maskers screeching to, ""trust science,"" months ago, admitting trusted science confirmed fear narrative. Continuing mask mandates guidelines subside much trusting science, lol. would funniest shit Republican prize meet President Biden. continue wear masks everywhere despite fully vaccinated, anti-maskers greatest unfounded fear. state, middle schoolers (grades 6-8) turn 12 January 6th grade, turn 12 first months 7th grade. K age cutoff December 31. Dirty old men can't really hit 

Challenge accepted!  sorry answer many idiots. Kudos man. ""butta face"", butterface.

It means ""everything looks good face"". Yes, sometimes consequences choices mean can’t something important. 

This doesn’t take away choice. 


Besides, there’s still options people choose get vaccine get college education. read somewhere linked giving oxygen needed. Oxygen usually run distilled water give humidity inhalation. water reserves affected somehow, fungal growth expected. want. However, longer trusting 'the science'. contrary, continuing wear mask, despite fact fully vaccinated cannot spread infection necessary, also anti-science. 

People continue wear masks want, least admit nothing covid safety, admit wanting show face anywhere. conversations people like week. It’s like talking children. I’m patient, inquisitive, ask questions stick even spot think gave adequate answers (they didn’t). let know appreciate conversations talk concerns doctors.

No, commenting presence super spreaders, questioning u/azn_dude1 seemed suggest SARS-COV2 abnormally infectious. particularly. 

 fact change needed terms vaccine coverage (and measures control) stop it. 

I agree understanding super spreaders important, far. super spreaders randomly distributed throughout population R0 useful knowing fact affect vaccine strategy. super spreaders (for example) concentrated 30-40 year olds vaccine strategy act effectively. knowledge super spreaders make R0 larger corollary make effective vaccine strategy less effective. It’s one thing drive slow. It’s another thing drive slow passing lane everyone else also. 

I couldn’t care less want wear mask alone apartment. it’s time drop mandating finger wagging it. pandemic plane fuel gliding crash landing. may technically “over”…but it’s over. I'm sure I'd rather die eyes removed. also weird government issuing result scientific study.... governmental website..

Why? UK's healthcare run publicly. India (David Attenborough voice): ""Every summer, cacophony honking fills air, migratory flocks Bennies heads shore. "" it’s cost able something important isn’t right. That’s point know know ""And shout Steve Williams Rhode Island getting vaxxed up, real one"" DISCLAIMER I’m lawyer medical professional, advice. 

The process signing for, receiving vaccine local pharmacy easy online. case didn’t even ask photo ID went it. It’s pretty lax I’m sure anybody interested could make happen. huge amount luck virus reasonably stable, far viruses go. spike protein change much, vaccines targeted. evolve away mechanism, might mean longer threat.

Terrible analogy, kinda like targeting runners legs. train more, get stronger faster. can't out-train baseball bat knee. need catch sofabitch first. required full authorization rather emergency use authorization take time. Pfizer applied full authorization 16+ we're looking December/January best 12-15. every opinion matters. opinions people don’t know useless determining type person are. 

The scientist wrote study doesn’t care opinion scientist read title variant spike proteins similar we’ve seen UK, South Africa, etc. there’s reason believe vaccines don’t hold it, t-cell response unchanged across variants anyways. wonder kind thing happening India (obviously India way worse)...but kind notice trend areas way well lockdown (Czech Republic, India, Poland)...they really bad 2nd waves. sure that's due complacency people believing virus big deal due spared lack natural immunity either way, trend noticed...you see kind happening SEA good job beginning starting see rise cases/deaths.  Sure. commenting (lack) difficulty explaining codes. I'm surprised people snapped, too. great know they'll able proper phase 3 study there’s reason expect able evade vaccines it’s spike protein similar variants haven’t able evade vaccines. huge school fall since half typical high school even eligible vaccine prior. going make environments particularly vulnerable even community large well vaccinated. probabilities also basic virology. people think vaccines real world chance ineffective. ones even know basics. area never mask mandate outdoors yet common get dirty looks wear one, even people spaced widely apart like hiking trails. sidewalk, people glare step aside, seem want make clear I'm bothering them.

So tired BS. become form social shaming. Here's another idea. make everyone wear mask 15-20 mins they're store? Absurdly easy. Requires statewide system every single retailer ties even grandma issues. positive effect mine. Working home godsend. 

I'm sure lot people feel way quite profitable talk industry thankful I'm leaving months. Hope blow control India style next 2 months. Think goes store gym carry phone ID either. carry pre-paid card get soda snack working (gym Walmart next strip mall). I'm happy put mask. I'm going carry phone around card QR code could easily forged. No, really, people want, stop thinking weird.

I grocery store recently young lady wearing top hat adorned manner fur, ornaments, feathers, decorations, looked like kind Mad Hatter's hat. otherwise dressed acted normally. power ya, hey weird. CDC outdoor mask mandates extremely conservative. There's reason vaccinated person wear mask outdoors. Period. chart widely panned.

That 6 foot study indoors poor ventilation vaccinated. 

From comment, dont think read article posted, here's another Good EU pressuring US. EU save world alone, west needs work together this. It’s basic math. 9,125/114,258,244 fully vaccinated Americans = .007% Data points.  need least 6 months trial data submit BLA (full FDA approval). Pfizer first start trials thus first get approvals EUA. simply bit head start. 

I fully expect Moderna apply within next month. Ditto submission approval 12-17 year olds. come within next weeks.

Everything Pfizer doing, add 2-4 weeks Moderna right behind virtually thing. right.  follow science imposing restrictions ignore science comes eliminating restrictions 1) I'm twitter;

2) PURPOSE Horrible thing causing black fungus illegal many areas years ago store somewhere someone walking around face covered... think weird, and/or person commit crime? Here's one Wuhan one regarding London ? highly doubt 100k deaths London. thought CDC pretty clear feel need outdoor masks. even made nice graphic chart dumb down. still see 90% people areas Manhattan wearing masks empty sidewalks.

And they’re legitimately scared COVID. Many people eating indoors close full capacity restaurants nobody mask on. MIT study showed, you’re really protected sitting 6 feet another table indoors. quite like winter extra warm. sometimes feel self conscious face nice slap mask it, think look pretty stylish too. Crawfish everyone site, wonder produces signal post vaccination allergic reaction stats? weird? Holy crap Similar situation NZ. precedent quarantine law smallpox thing. Lol okay!

Let pay $50,000 go college abroad I’m going state school cheap tuition.  true! North Florida south. don’t get it.. want to, love here. UK same, 28 days rather 30. literally ""No shirt, shoes, service"" signs door pretty much every grocery store. California also political disaster. much people voted Californian political policies moving state. Last Us begins. Indian variant what?

[Vaccine FAQ Part FAQ Part appointment bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Dude like me. considered fully vaccinated early February still fear public awhile. Even seeing anti mask idiots public enough stay away. We're really beating thing man. I'm really happy. Walmart today, announcing walk-in Moderna vaccines pharmacy. line, figure lot people thought, ""I'm already here, not?"" there's side effect like next year

This happen. Vaccine side effects appear year later. 

You might well craft what-if scenario around possibility alien race appear exterminate people vaccinated Covid-19. likely. bit silly require masks indoors, unless eating drinking. vaccine getting fully fda certified? would lot assuages vaccine hesitancy, since emergency certification Vermonter here, thanks! I'm sorry places still much higher, look like reasonably good news out. Elementary school age would good too. K-5 (6–11yrs) Sweden, UK, Germany, Isreal, also 25% covid deaths excess deaths.

Australia example -5k excess deaths, compared 860 covid deaths. bunch gibberish 3 Australian? 4 Japan break one incorrect tried.

Older age groups vaccine already spreading it. Younger age groups really getting new doses spreading amongst form herd immunity preventing massive transmission. 

Add lockdown measures still effect + removed (You'll notice cases started going pubs opened) see numbers relatively consistent months. help, probably won’t reverse slide. We’re probably adding 16 17 million newly eligible people change. 

Biggest barrier still getting hesitants get shots. people say masks ones say won’t vax.

There substantial evidence people vaccinated spread virus. Quite old study vaccines likely available west, hope true non-chinese vaccines humans too.

For care: Alexandra J Spencer et al pre-print paper consistent. Also, keep eye com-cov results later month. interested, kids 3 think? Googled it, get 4 12? Yes bad Anyone know total number active cases currently Texas? Someone gave detailed explanation reply comment. received gold award. vial contain 6 doses portion must taken time, nurse instead got confused injected everything quoted doctor brought said ""whatever dude"" sure. media. Mills rescind mask mandate, actually.

And tourists flooded aren’t following guidelines. second shot Moderna gave even less side effects described. Slightly sore arm, couple lethargy, nothing. Why? nine year old gets it. can't officials schools ever say they'll require masks social distancing buildings classes full capacity?

That major motivation students. Exactly 900k deaths study suggests seems kind unreasonable 700k excess deaths (likely closer 600k) means authors suggesting saved extra 200k+ deaths mitigation measures put place. Although say mentioned elsewhere subreddit someone point deaths decline recession seem plenty evidence Great Depression recent recession area expertise also say pretty skeptical IHME since COVID models often failed miserably. average 40k/day appears like continue fall. break 35k we'll lowest point since June summer second wave, plausably lowest point ever since testing infrastructure limited back then. He's simply proving point: like Trump, nobody admit Modi's faults without capitulating false narrative opponents feeble out-of-touch. article skipping PanAm games Brazil, Olympics.

I can't imagine anyone thrilled going Brazil next month. needed Olympic qualifications perhaps they'll establish alternate method.  Actually, one - smallpox. Polio close still couple endemic pockets, diseases eradicated parts world - rubella North America. So, like tuberculosis, plague, yellow fever many others, COVID19 probably go away entirely become virtually invisible people lucky enough live places competent health systems and/or decent personal health insurance. keep athlete villages separate. Don’t allow tourism event. Good, got JNJ hoping get mRNA booster whenever becomes necessary. honest question here, i’m trying understand this. fact can’t differentiate matter? aren’t fully vax’d (i’ve first jab), wearing mask, maybe even everyone else you’re around fully vax’d (i filming recently room everyone else vax’d still wore mine). are, what’s problem? missing something?
sorry have, i’m trying figure life resume 2nd shot, horribly missing seeing music, going eat, going dancing, etc. would think vaccine worst pandemic least 100 years would skipped head line/top priority

That's Emergency Use Authorization for.

I see full Approval would contingent circumstances got EUA lever sitting right they've already pulled it. Double Olympics 2022? math 1/3 12-15 year olds get vaccine, push partially vaccinated number around 53 54 percent state. combined 16+ folks gradually getting vaccinated, means able reach +55% end May. That's magic started happen Israel cases truly plummeted. I'm hoping see here. looked too. Presumably need advisory committee recommendations actually open appointments.  I’m editing attempted reply different (and much nastier) comment somehow sent one.

You’re awesome, dude! Keep faith! 🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻 Yeah, hearing Fauci hint going maskless sooner later uplifting. He's made overly cautious statements (rightfully typically) past 15 months. I'm going vacation July I'm starting think fully-vaccinated ass might able go maskless part, maybe except plane. allowed in. Seems safe Half dose full dose fine make appointment Thursday Friday? 
I’m impatiently waiting younger kids eligible.  Offer discounts mask wearers Sounds like Japan, Germany, Italy?

Oh infer case fatatily rate stil unknown know less .5 percent. Weird use pronoun introduce antecedent. UK counts death within 28days positive test measure. may technically overcounting, definitely counting world due measure massive testing program. happened 2-3 years 2020, would made difference me, since home times anyway. suspect lot people fit category. Sure hope did. Quite new comment I'd say tho Really dumb thing cancel especially Massachusetts continues vaccinate great pace Nah. They're fucked. got vaccinated almost certainly going fine. lot southerners go northeast celebrate 4th July though. probably worried tourism states low vaccination rates. day turn 16 wont affect anymore Given ample supply, maybe could book end-of-week appointment saying kid 16 get past automated age screening restrictions lifted mid-week. thoughts exactly Probably 12 15 year old son Give time, hug again. *Super Hero Origin Story entered chat* think people describing misbehavior ""side"" (i.e., religious zealots). counterpoint anecdata, asthma terrible allergies generally get sick easily, side effects either sore arm thinking want complain person hierarchy situation. managed book appointment doctolib today AZ. seem releasing slots batches time keep checking. you’ve ever watched ad big dumb action movie light beer, realize already live society least things targeted lowest common denominator. know comment old, *man* misunderstand South Korea's data too, 87% 89%. 12 15 eligible receive Pfizer. Well also reason England 0 today report much Sunday. Nice Yeah, figured get point summer guess phrased question ""get 50% *much* sooner?"" wonder temporary surge new vaccinations enthusiastic parents wanting get kids vaccinated right away. probably last long, might make walk-in impractical little while. misunderstand vaccines work. animal studies indicate mixing doses probably effective 4 month mark COVISHIELD shipment July 3 there's lots time consider results Com-Cov study.

This ""farce"" pandemic.  real life test study would indian variant travel israel.

As soon israel report uptick covid, game vaccines new mutant evaded it.

I follow what's happening israel litmus test world.  specific, 4 41 fully vaccinated. Also, article makes mention whether 4 symptoms, severe symptoms did. 
We already know vaccine makes 95% less likely catch covid. make 100% less likely catch it. means vaccinated people still going get disease. It’s good watched closely, let’s freak good reason to. Either idiot troll. Either way, worth engaging  probably lead 2-3% increase % vaccinated US population. Sounds small, lot regions that's going difference summer. love see it!  pretty safe bet US would get anyways, June so. yes make go faster. good news coming someone works high school tired virtual school. school work face-to-face virtual option since October, 70% parents opted keep kid(s) home virtual. vaccine, district likely require kids come back fall. parents scared, excuse now. Get kid vaccinated let's move forward! Norway far much better outcome pandemic pretty much European countries 141 deaths/million pop. also good access mRNA vaccines. think afford this. Definitely happened couple people know, glad lucked out! That’s well good, fact matter is, vaccine hesitancy phenomenon needs overcome going hit herd immunity, “how get large numbers people stuff” well understood field study now. 

Telling stupid people they’re stupid might feel good, isn’t going get want. vaguely remember something vials originally designed four doses later decided could stretch six doses per vial increase supply. 4-dose test numbers could based 1.8ml supply current 6-dose vial. many people can't get COVID vaccine medical reasons? CDC FDA cleared virtually everyone 16 them, including immunocompromised people, cancer patients, etc. three authorized vaccines far, someone allergy one vaccine, two others choose from.

So... many people can't get COVID vaccine?   say wanted lockdowns? think keep indoor masking keep limits high risk things like crowded nightclubs concerts. &amp;#x200B;

when last polio case US?

***every*** kid gets 2 kinds Polio vax - 3-4 shots time they're 6.

&amp;#x200B;

**Combination examples common combination vaccines children are:

 • Pediarix, combines DTaP, Hep B, IPV (polio)

 • ProQuad, combines MMR varicella (chickenpox) 

• Kinrix, combines DTaP IPV (polio) 

• Pentacel, combines DTaP, IPV (polio), Hib

'Mix match' UK Covid vaccine trial vaccines ***might give broader, longer-lasting immunity virus*** new variants it, offer flexibility vaccine rollout. People outside probably 20 yards group people clear risk happens, guess experiment cooking ""krokodil"" - doubt mRNA much technologically advanced that. doesn’t state, they've said local state department health also authorize it. However likely day CDC makes recommendation well one tell Ariana Grande. even single variant made major vaccine completely ineffective? Roll daily AZ flogging! understanding, large public events quite difficult staff insure right now. cancellations entirely cautious fault. tourists coming games might happen though, Olympic-fan friends, would rather restriction people around games let happen bring people together it. Oh, checked guess live high transmission area. seems like whole lower mainland ""high transmission area"" though. talk opening international borders least 2022. don’t think providing incentive moment. 

It’s really strange situation Yeah we've one  white lantern Texas can't ban showing proof vaccination EU. 2 3 American Vaccines made Europe yet U.S. ahead.


You fight senseless wars globe century learn thing two logistics. really understand relevant. Um, yeah, get it. wouldn’t want Olympic either case. Also, WTF Japan???? Who'd thunk? think vaccine allergic gluten careful that.

And, oh yeah, vegan ! ""This literally resulting people one side road able apply vaccination time people side unable they’re different local government area, ticketing system different/incomplete/etc. ""

This happened near Philadelphia area. live southeast City Ave, Philadelphia City/County different vaccine system rest state, including different phase categorizations. live northwest side, Montgomery County, part statewide system.

Of course, neither computerized queue system March so. applied see open appointments got snapped 9 so. USA, showed long name matched name appointment, nobody really verified anything else whether supposed there. would trust main source reading rag posted here.

What next, Sun? Nope. 
Source: Don’t health insurance free. That’s bullshit know?! good news  know 3 people aged 24-35ish? filled form checking availability got response appointment quickly. Northampton that's works Fuck Olympics specifically, fuck IOC. Corrupt idiots. I'm tired ""This may mean super scary thing happen"" really mean nobody specifically tested rule out. May while. US catching UK fast vaccination stats seems pacing slightly behind; suspicion we're starting see effects higher (much) vaccine scepticism US. Like what?

People screaming precautions taken away.  Well, likely alternative? sell excess stockpiles used, that's better keeping storage discarded, guess. Yeah place went months ago checks anything,(even though qualified pre existing) sign times available it. army legion nurses.

Took grand total like 20 minutes, 5 mins park, get card, jab. 15 minutes see I'd pass out. way. sentence that:

Herd immunity created via vaccination contributed eventual eradication smallpox in 1977 contributed reduction diseases.

In literally one case ever herd immunity resulted eradication. mean herd immunity sorts diseases. long ago Olympics happened year.

Also, I've played Plague Inc, know happens hold Olympics. :P even make sense. Pfizer widely regarded best vaccine (even variants); approved yet?! clarification, vaccination groups split 10 year increments. 45-55 year olds 25-35 etc. know guy awfully pessimistic though, big regions started people born '71 today we've soon covered groups risk. husband discovered all-important skill haircuts pandemic. easy, mine slightly harder.

No need waste time money barber ever again. cannot opinion? way kind makes sense seeing that’s many people US fully vaccinated. need get tested you’re vaccinated symptoms. best got, that’s pretty bad. 

The Southerners go Massachusetts vacation (or dare say, “summer”) getting vaccinated. Completely false. Trump losing states like Pennsylvania Michigan 5 less points huge number undecideds fucking awesome!! Watch Shin Godzilla 

It pokes bad bureaucracy Japan adding giant monster.   must make countries sick. great news. Honestly, number one concern last couple months vaccine-resistant variant tear one current hot spots dramatically reset progress. long things remain fairly stead-state scenario come pass, return normalcy much less jeopardy derailed.  12 year olds? They’re dicks It’s privilege 25%. I’m introvert experienced traumatic events pandemic don’t think it’s matter extrovert vs introvert GF went dinner bowling Saturday. Good crowds, good energy, we're crushing here. statistics inhabitants IQ ?

Are referring one that's currently top vaccinations everyone else? great news folks, alabama lowest rate spread nation, 7 day cases per 100k people 1 lower californias

the bad news alabama also one highest positivity rates country, california one lowest YES! let's focus 2-11 year olds 6 months+ Here's alternative  get additional COVID vaccines FDA/CDC recommends it.

Did get vaccine card record? Haha dude could say never set foot city life. Hmmm… jab possibly stab. I’m in. Sound like adventure can’t pass up. tourism get you’re banning tourists? shot foot move. like idea, dislike implication dumb people go Chili’s. love Chili’s.   Yes, agree position. totally inaccurate. means country leader extra cautious regarding COVID. ways avoid worse, bit like climate change. People afraid change self centered. herd immunity threshold reached, disease gradually disappears population. elimination, achieved worldwide, may result permanent reduction number infections zero, called That’s experts saying. window reach herd immunity missed it. going going camp year, last year could go. decided amount restrictions put place would made bad wasn’t worth it. 

At point fully vaccinated 3 months Covid virtually nonexistent. I’m happy. say asymptomatic people less likely lasting immunity might danger future infections, virus able much damage? seems like immune system barely lift finger. I'm young healthy ill mild symptoms two weeks. 86 grandmother health problems asymptomatic. Strange way works.  US state live medical exemptions revoked, curbside delivery considered reasonable accomodations.   kind people want vaccine also answer 

Yes answer surveys otherwise surveys would show 100% people wanting vax Still happening WA. started plateuaing rising weeks. definitely lower natural immunity. locked well Must break more? Australia 3 shots kids covering 13 diseases. Flu included feared mucor spread brain invasive surgery last-ditch recourse, Indian doctors forced remove infected jaw bone, nose, eyes patients.

That's enough reddit today believe sun star giant named Sonny written stone. /S know serious japan citizen protest Yea. Half million insignificant... /s Fuck it. Full-on Olympics 2022. capacity restrictions. mask mandate nonsense (which work -- specifications types masks required = bullshit). Fight princesses. comments cautious virus downvoted?

If people openly admitted still continuing treat virus vaccinated, science denial. openly admitting vaccine effective, regardless intention. W  Same. people react strongly awkward situations even know they're fake. learned nothing Goodfellas? mention time booster (if one going made) time it’s finished new variant could show up

Seriously playing cat mouse point called asking question Supreme needs kind tie-in/giveaway vax. people would really show up. ever start talking realistically, absolutely retroactively.

If didn't, people might hold bigger bigger rewards, would defeat whole purpose. Because:
A) allow virus spread population, you’re also allowing opportunities mutate evade vaccines. Every new host new chance create new super bug. 
B)vaccines full proof people still get sick even they’ve vaccinated 
C) people autoimmune disorders can’t get vaccinated want bros backs. 

Look NY measles outbreaks coming unvaccinated Hasidic community. It’s going like that, nationwide. Occasional outbreaks lockdowns, people won’t get shots. wait Thanks, that's interesting. Ugh, let younger child get already.... smart take vaccine, obvious right decision.

Not taking hand... Considering time year ago number mRNA vaccine doses ever produced likely less 100,000, that's pretty incredible. Yes!!! long die need serious hospitalization, vaccine working 100% Covid new meningitis college dorms seems. called estimate bold pretty much right mark. Congrats! would prove said health measures would prevented people getting infected. Sweden didn’t substantially worse death rates Europe, despite locking down, makes think long Covid rates worse? buy wholesale astroturf please? stop media insinuating new quadruple mutant mega variant kill us right around corner. Whatever takes keep us line fearful virus instead government belongs. Nice, that's like 285% immunity! get saying first figured halfway response..

But yeah, there's good chance parents kid that's nearly 16 would likely ok it. guess would retirees dot com bubble, potentially disability claims 9/11 see cases. Obviously many cases go untested, that’s given. don’t know enough criteria used determine covid death wrap head around Fauci’s statement though. Hoping comments yield interesting perspectives. design! :-) US values decentralized government  FDA looks whether vaccine safe. CDC looks safe would effective strategy population. example: FDA found FluMist Quadrivalent nasal shot safe, CDC recommend couple specific flu seasons data showing limited effectiveness protection, overall strategy protecting individual patients population recommended flu shots showed better data.

So Pfizer safe (hypothetically) 20% effective age group, FDA would approve CDC might say let's wait data Moderna see effective put shots 10 million kids arms. Yes correct masks. hear mask mandates dropped, think tx fla. Alright, time check vaccines available city come zombies. phone adobes customer support agent told this. know bad phone agent asks pray them. That's vaccine side effects tests work, yes. Vaccines side effects show months later, fourteen years olds incredibly different results seventeen year olds. reason vaccines fully approved know long lasting immunity is. I'm Nebraska. would like get whole ass cow getting vaccinated. average 3 cows per person here, enough cows. lockdowns pretty awesome save annoyances, got stay comfort zone time. Problem comfort zone shrunk massively, things starting ease aware anxiety waaaaaaaay worse forced step it. 6-11 expects results July, .5-5 September. likely one (large) shot exactly effect one (normal) shot.  normal shot provides enough targets train normal immune system.  Extra targets might matter. I'm thinking might see people wearing winter imagine last long. see society whole adopting masks United States. physically larger country US way) 

I know probably bait, stupid take. easy deaths one lives country. 

You know place COVID-19 cases all? Antarctica. moon. types vaccines used strain covid. efficacy side effects absolutely studied. already know side effects building antibodies. fair concern. data far shows short long term effects vaccine far better short long term effects COVID. Yes, we'd like data long term effects both. far, every step way, COVID always worse.

The argument always say, ""So FAR!"". Hey, one predict future better someone else, use abilities probability statistics I'm decision making. math says use vaccines.

There's super geeky podcast called ""This Week Virology"". give weekly clinical update that's like 20-40ish minutes long. like fair scientists correct mistakes make them. Give listen mood unleash inner nerd. research local options, many places finding demand decreasing, meaning available appointments schedule. Others walk-ins appointment necessary. Also check around see different places doing, local health department may following set rules companies like CVS following different ones federal vaccine centers another third different thing. can't fix table take Monica Gandhi. 

Redditors annoying HAHA yo that’s dad right says article thought whole vial dose able fit single syringe. Many vaccines packaged single dose vials think likely honest mistake. care herd immunity vaccines generally available?

If chance get vaccine, take got Covid-19, really need care society? nicer casket? Hell yeah. got teenage son appointment end week! slower cumulative. Looking graph, I'm trying figure huge spike 2001. timing would make think Bush administration rules something like that, recall policy changes around SS time.  United States 50.7 million foreign born residents. means one five people living country birth live United States.

The United States clearly best metric, fact #1 choice immigrants proves #1 many facets (else would immigrants go United States?). mean, immigrants chose immigrate somewhere else, like Canada, example? Generalization. middle school
Started 5th grade. 9-10 agree need evidence panic.

However, statement almost bad. don’t know effective vaccines variant. here. kids can’t handle another year homeschooling really want feel better letting go back fall-vaccines would give least. Find another subreddit troll, maybe? serious questions. takes get data certain types deaths. like car accidents.

if know many fewer deaths from.those happened; can't move total deaths from.the regular distribution excess deaths ratio.

normally year two lag. Let put way:

1. vaccinated trial: 0 deaths!
2. unvaccinated placebo control group trial...0 deaths!

.... 3) vaccine prevents 100% deaths!

Can see two vaccine trials explicitly report hospitalizations efficacy outcome make latter issue clear. vaccine, one person control group severe COVID-19, eight people hospitalized; [Johnson &amp; 34 people placebo group severe COVID-19, five people hospitalized. It’s true zero vaccinated people hospitalized either study vaccines took effect. **But numbers small, can’t draw reliable conclusion high efficacy may outcomes. Diana Zuckerman National Center Health Research** [**pointed **about Johnson &amp; Johnson trial, “It’s misleading tell public nobody vaccinated hospitalized unless also tell 5 people placebo group hospitalized.”** She’s right. can’t confident predicting effectiveness precisely wider population outside trial, either. example, vaccine trials included relatively people older 60 participants.

You see fragile numbers looking compiled severe disease. **In the** [**Pfizer example, one vaccinated person developed severe COVID-19 versus three placebo group—which meant single bout disease made difference calculated efficacy rate 66 percent one 100 percent.** trials, zero people severe disease vaccinated group versus one control group, adding subtracting one would even dramatic. **The problem even greater deaths. efficacy analysis, two vaccine trials—for Moderna’s Johnson &amp; Johnson’s—reported COVID-19 deaths control groups.** least wear masks socially distance. mean country insists still using fax machines flexible adopt new vaccine plan? I'm shocked. don’t to. TX job legally required fire you. Learned husband jury duty-lucky 3 days job didn’t pay all. tough month us losing 3 full days pay like that. agree high number low symptomatic cases makes need evolutionary pressure become less deadly. already deadly disease. Spanish flu way. Something like Ebola become less deadly survive. Almost everyone gets covid walks away feeling like mild severe cold.

Getting vulnerable vaccinated mitigation effort work. deadly enough convince people vaccinate staunchly opposed. wish would. True, still body transfer won’t know stranger vaccines not.

Still better safe sorry. He/She knows that. They're trolling. Thanks this!

It's bad tracker graphs show first doses. said, way better could own, thank much! :) Also depending live school year ends soon, like end month. means kids could wait school over, could go since school year winding anyway. Especially since side effects common second dose they'd getting school got out. Idk making claim table inaccurate, take Twitter email show update table accurate. hesistency cutoff ratio.

you 50% ish must get category; 10% get immediately//other reasons last normally hesistency/religion/health 

the news increased hesistency group. Wtf covid mutated contagious, probably need 80%-90% population get vaccinated herd immunity. 

Kids alone won’t get us there. math doesn’t work out. alone! also hard lock kids (14 15) fully vaxxed immunity peak. make far give now!!  problem schooling situation. Okay compared 3,500/day December January, think 700 pretty good.

It still ways fall, fact US mostly open (compared countries) isn’t huge spikes cases deaths good indicator vaccine working. vaccines amazing. can't believe variant beaten yet. I've selected 15 years, actually call courthouse, call automated line day week told need next day. kid forcefully vaccinated US? thinking live US, telling everyone normal life, ""whenever happens, happens"" start counting days yet  This! People careful actually read article, find interview directly. Didn’t learn click bait means buzzfeed articles early 2010’s? numbers going huge government restrictions we’re opening like now. fact things basically open cases last September huge. respect nonsense views? respect right opinion (whatever even means beyond police thoughts) views silly dangerous. respect required.  think makes sense say hug people know point.

But I'm still sceptical social distancing completely relaxed nightclubs open June, target demographic gotten even first shot. know works, maybe concurrently happening? Like FDA panel meets Mondays CDC panel meets Thursdays, whatever. agree, mandatory, doubt it. know someone afraid hanging around vaccinated!!!  Contact sports mandatory vaccination requirement.

Good way get anti vaxxer parents comply. "" set measures"" ... okay. think know mean. 

The ends justifies means, right? headline bit misleading. read body text, said people may choose wear masks cold flu season. Something doing! mostly teasing continuing online stuff extreme.

Though I'm working home permanent telecommuter man, year COVID rough terms social isolation. I'm glad I've double-vaccinated getting back world again! visiting one household, going parks social distanced. *overcounting* Personally think offer vaccines restaurants bars instead. people going places likely spread COVID first place, plus aren’t huge hurry already something 15 minute wait

People taking subway gonna huge hurry aren’t gonna want wait 15 minutes  8 6 year olds want shots going back school. saw husband get 2 Moderna shots, talked everything them. **MASSACHUSETTS UPDATE**

Notes: 

* FDA provides EUA age 12-15 Pfizer, awaits CDC approval. 6,101,782 estimated 12+ population using 2020 census (7,029,917 overall) (not 2019 estimate). 
* (- n days), difference predicted date compared predicted dates peak first doses back 4/14 emergency use authorization? Yay chance see significant amount outdoors. They'll probably fairly common public transport might see elderly people wearing around, think lot.

But new virus ever pops somewhere, solid 40% back full time masking government says anything. could walk office, might feel way. Instead it’s 90 minutes day waiting crowded bus, absolutely love wfh.  We’re seeing low numbers yet. ~700 deaths day haven’t fallen much last month. think make fair point. definitely going around sure. article also talks reasons people want keep wearing seemed social reasons basically want hide faces. 

I think read also people frankly still afraid long life like it’s sort hard “pull trigger” getting back way things used be. Mentally mean. take time get there.  It’s struggle think sort compassion people too. whole thing sucked us it’s probably good guess cut people slack. Everyone fighting battles way. Explanation can't really group US Israel UK yet. Cases still comparable European countries nowhere near levels two. one example:  
But lot books subject, *Epidemics Pandemics: Impacts Human History*. 
The first sixth cholera pandemics started Bengal. officier Vasco De Gama also described Calcutta 1503 sure disease. I'd try it, guess.  That's hope too. Numbers falling cliff right now. think 10k day sometime June possible. least outdoors camp kids wear masks. 

I really worry prolonging measures young children many months. Kids supposed socialize distancing/masks inhibit that. Again, health information national database run feds. never get abused anyone ever reason. Distancing probably businesses can't operate properly enforcing it. since masking (and guess handwashing doenst make difference Covid) economic cost, stay longer. waiting for? knowingly allergic compound like vaccines unsafe fuck sake America.... getting sick exposing germs helps immune system one. hard time understanding people who've lived like last year think keep masking feel right get sick.

If want keep dude, expecting rest us go along nope me. grandma's murder trial.

She got 20 life. talking point heard lot early ""most people going die anyway"". true lot deaths old likely die within next years. portion likely die start pandemic now, died earlier COVID. Someone died COVID March without COVID would lived September excess death, still died COVID.

I idea scale this, COVID deaths would 2020 deaths one way another. reductions things like flu deaths, whole host causes could increased decreased deaths. never prevent 100% COVID deaths. people vaccinated get sick go die extremely unfortunate, also extremely improbable. want save lot lives right now? Ban drinking outside home. Ban swimming pools. Ban cars capable going 60 mph. pandemic anyone vaccinated, anyone chosen be. evade vaccines, America/Israel/UK, much contagious compared B.1.1.7.? That's possibly worrying well May ask country? :( warmth, cold day. mean, one fundamentals starting national Healthcare U.S. need health records. follow wherever treated, doctors diagnose faster full picture eating, doing, around. 

A lot data already collected marketing, Google social media. 
  way America praised calling patent waivers hypocritical EU supplying world since beginning year. course one recognises that. Even then, get passing someone. stop face face conversation close range unvaccinated. checks r/UpliftingNews cross post (by US Govt) /s health care workers died severe symptoms contracting disease work. Jofel Segui, ER RN LA died 4 months ICU. 46. Great scientific argument.

[The vaccine tested children 16 years age.] initial results trials children aged 12-15, time impossible tell that's case children obviously long term risks.

[Children young people remain low risk COVID-19 mortality] rarely die even get seriously ill, children experiencing mild flu symptoms. goes healthy people regardless age. 

Also, explain children need vaccinated high-risk groups elderly people already vaccinated? parents get vaccine. 12 16 whatever, small risk hesitate even call risk. over. know downvoted, know many people actually flourished pandemic, great mentally physically. hate people work anyways, agree working home great. like night day mask introduced area around mid March like everyone else country. weekend grocery store believe days Trump’s address, people wearing masks gloves gave weird looks. Literally weekend later store, weird looks shifted masked maskless. People beginning social distancing, visually avoid people coughed, look edge reality finally sunk virus. weeks passed, masks started becoming common stores like looked like people adapted. probably complaints there, overall became commonplace wear mask.

We’ve long won’t surprised we’ve reached China levels always wear one public stores. Perhaps lost faith humanity common sense around virus like readying bigger one hits society continues carefree. saddened see little people cared last summer holidays. numbers kept piling still people didn’t care. 

My faith restored watching fellow statesmen receive vaccine doses along besides hearing hesitancy. there’s pill take prescribed doctor works way Tamiflu flu we’ll even better sense security bases covered. Old people. yes least de Santis vaccines. really hope kids maskless camp year year. mean, wear masks rules, I'm hoping numbers stay low enough mask mandates removed relax. deserves credit, yes. Operation warp speed helped fund moderna. Thanks Pfizer BioNtec too, receive funding Operation Warp Speed. place MAY mandate someone remove mask banks (and financial institutions) 70%+ gets vaccinated. plan wear mask winter season got winter without getting cold IMHO masking up. (Hopefully, N95s cheaper coming winter since people probably masking up, probably need N95 keep safe flu cold). page shows data date vaccination, date reporting. There's varying amount reporting lag. Even days differently colored range usually doses trickling in.

Edited add, there's option switch ""daily change reported"", total doses, date report instead date administration. I’m looking case graph UK see nothing long tail 5k cases per day varies day variation comes reporting week.

I’m seeing comment saying 1k cases per day, I’m seeing worldometers site. haven’t even gotten 2k cases mean onion? feel like conclusion something onion article. somebody study see water wet? Population adjusted, UK actually administered thr nber, possibly slightly more, doses doses compared US. man bad cold, getting caught COVID, getting vaxxed caught another bad cold lasted like week. bad luck date change title totally understand point view tolerance people. It’s frustrating deal “Ill never take mask ever types” make really good point conditioned year assume that’s going case wear mask outside rather militant forever maskers. 

I hope cases go people feel comfortable wearing masks outside think will. point don’t get tell mask nothing.

But *do* get tell shoes nothing? 

Cool beans. 

Many people find requiring employees stand entire shifts annoying abusive, yet y'all still shop places crap. 

Wearing mask necessity cases, neither fucking apartheid. That's awesome you. me, fogs shit glasses, extra humidity lenses causes lot dust dirt stick them. also severely messed beard point trim style think looks particularly good me. consider things slightly worse minor annoyance. absolutely mind beginning fact wearing mask long Fauci said need changed minds said do. COVID, got double vaxxed, wearing mask pure theater. nothing protect me. I'd really like never wear again. Sexism? Somebody call Ellie Joel, work them. Yeah, hopefully I'll get vaccinated soon since FDA approved 12+, I'm fully vaccinated time go camp, there's still many masks restrictions, camp terrible. even know parents signed up, lol. amazing winter too. One dose either elicit enough response. anything give virus better ‘look’ cause worse mutation. Florida: we’re concerned health citizens
Also Florida: party Wayne party Garth mean, someone wears helmet they're walking they're protected trip fall, I'm going think that's weird totally weird disproportionate response unlikely danger.

They it. Still weird though. I'm praying board education enough sense keep rules. I'm Kansas it's... harder, find enough rational people. UK made informed gamble vaccines would give useful immunity one dose, therefore giving first doses many possible ideal. US directly followed evidence particular vaccines showed effectiveness shorter gap doses. Yeah no. I'm going cater kind.

Grasp implicit language. Afraid, nothing. fuck would want someone else's cold? There's positive benefit spreading cold around. 

I've gone entire year without getting cold even single time, fucking *rocks* compared alternative. needed get rid annoying interruption life make slightly difficult people sneeze vegetable section supermarket? 

If business decides beneficial customers wear stuff, I'm it, honestly. Masks outdoor stupid might playing part it, think Republicans also skeptical vaccines begin with. reason wear mask outdoors, vaccinated not, unless crowded street. don’t think people considering illnesses like influenza, countries affected SARS permanently culturally adopting masks? certainly scientific, efficacious flu shot. 

There also fairly limited evidence vaccinations prevent even substantially minimise spread practically. faith vaccines stupid someone wearing mask forever specifically covid care people makes comfortable - ask return consideration me. people insist they'll continue mask perpetuity large want force rest us too. different strains completely different diseases. talking one dose Pfizer one dose AZ. One dose either elicit large enough response body. anything help virus figure mutate faster contagious. Yeah hard using words like ""many"" ""often"" discussing entire group people bad analogy, hopefully then, vaccines kneecap it? Uptake vaccine UK general stunningly good. Something likr 95% 70s, compared 75% US.  mean that. think makes comfortable - threat vaccinated person spread contract virus small. Why. Why. Stop this. often socialise shop?  Well. continue live cave. loses boarding pass? 

/s  Here's thought: gives shit? increasingly evident vaccinated transmit it, mRNA vaccines incredibly effective every known variant. vaccinated, likely fine exposed. know CDC include vaccinated people self-isolation guidelines exposed someone COVID. listed INSANELY infectious. Common colds typically ~1.4 r0. Covid 2.5-5. Considering COVID common cold family viruses, that's pretty infectious comparison, kind like SARS pretty deadly ~10% fatality rate, even though many viruses deadly. Everything somewhat relative. COVID much infection common colds, infectious viruses deal with, middle road deadliness. relation common cold viruses, COVID monster. deadly cousins MERS SARS, much infections killed several magnitudes people combined, still carries higher % death rate vast bulk common cold viruses. killed estimated half per capita Spanish flu America.  serious question - seems quite correlation Republican voting states low vaccine demand. non American - result politicization pandemic?

What suppose I'm asking whether vaccine scepticism result politics, whether politics result generally sceptical (Uneducated? Untrusting government?) population?  whats best kid. need advertise expect us follow it. public, aka commom sense, decided scientific medical data?

 Good luck awful choice ""the easiest thing possible."" beard itch, warm climates hot, trying get 4 year old keep exercise futility, masks fit comfortably head larger average. fact is, quite inconvenient. I'll wear one people's sake bit longer, people act like putting mask putting shirt lying. go set appointment get one now? point don’t get tell mask nothing. 

Many people feel masks uncomfortable, especially people don’t sit home zoom day work person jobs. 

So totally understand thing annoying, wear limited time help save lives don’t effective interventions. 

I don’t tolerance “stop baby wear it, it’s big deal” there's scientific consensus sending him? Seems kind arbitrary. kid running around kids day camp mask vs make extremely small difference odds getting infected (which already probably tiny).  know chance spread outside incredibly low, zero given density live work (very dense) chances spread go bit. science say outdoors unmasked safe matter what, otherwise India would situation currently is. People area continue slowly wear masks outdoor less less, habit built year going go away week two. drop habit instantly great you, everyone works. almost exact reaction Moderna parents Pfizer. Maybe bit fever check.

But yes, 100mcg dose probably cause increased side effects.  I'm French thought worst administration world. I'm conflicted whether I'm happy sorry case. That's much problem. Yeah it'd hard rural areas could easily reach many hundreds millions people big cities. sounds like bigger issue honest sure. Many articles different news outlet reported similar estimations based cremations amount urns requested families.

I doubt number covid victims Wuhan far higher 3k. Ever since plantar warts kid NEVER go barefoot flooring public. Especially public pools showers gym. shudder thought cuz omg painful. case wondering, answer yes. authorization complete.

The CDC's part advisory committee (no real power) recommending shot opened 12-15 year olds immediately wait. we're awash supply ton demand, there's reason they'd say no.

Since actual authorization happened, that's legal hurdle. places tend defer CDC's recommendations... HIGHLY doubt showed 13 year old they'd turn away. need arms. good question. wonder they’d trials based comparing blood draws control group earth talking about?

A clear trend good! oddly everyone thinks it’s inflated. Great news! school environment much safer now. Hope schools forcing kids vaccinate. want free stay home feel safe virus gone. 10 year old, born made parents get TdaP. Told get can't see kid, two year old born got boosters. I'm 16 nobody except one classes want vaccine, fuck, one vaccinate classroom... No, simple solutions simple problems. Vaccines required every workplace/place business/public university/public school  really get weight control. cannot understate embarrassing, slow second vaccinated state planning reopen.

We're closing 75% adults already first doses MA.

I post [first dose stats like /u/Wizmaxman , slapped 95% adults counter stats. 

It's absurd. could vaccinate 95% adults first doses FULL TWO WEEKS 4th July, get second doses MONTH Boston's August 22nd reopening date. Got second dose yesterday, def felt side effects thus one. got done. Probably need 2nd shot then. Holy shit watch video? quite clearing trying shame people wearing them. certainly helped ""at time"" people lying to. best acting like media slanting words actual truth hidden. bad. think outright lied though. super COVID avoidant powers now? Japan organized orderly. 

Imagine house everything box put away in. Rubber bands? Box. Pins? Different box. imagine box requires document saying many items box, household member placed item box when. imagine storage filing systems paperwork. Etc.

Organization something Japanese government actually pretty insanely good at. *Efficiency* problem. honor system. I'm sure whatever whackadoodle parents enroll kids onboard.

Though say staff older students gotten vaccinated receiving notice could still attend, would socially distance get vaccine cooties others. Well, say vaccine cooties, say separate others avoid potential negative effects vaccine. Probably fine vaccines however may greater side effects administered often Ok, missed weren’t fully vaccinated read whole country vaccinated. 

However, wrong saying “this vaccine makes 95% less likely catch covid”. 95% percentage people stage 3 trial didn’t need hospitalized. vaccine prevent catching that’s point posting this. Asymptomatic infection probable covid keep spreading. What!? come Japan overrun cases death like India? Given population density, funeral pyres parking lots like India. That's weird. ever Japanese subway, know social distancing impossible there. flip fuck junior year isn’t normal. pandemic absolutely terrible.

I’m 16 almost friends want it. one classes, everyone least one shot (16 17 year olds). think depends lot area I’m Chicago.   ACTUALLY REFERENCING TITLE, oooohhhhh! train immunity exact thing. delivery method different cases vaccines prompt production covid spike proteins immune system attacks learns. SAME!!! YAYYYYY!!!!!!!!! Yeah wtf, paid normal rate you’re employed Omg thought gonna say got notice grandma passing away something like needs Top comment ask link somewhere give daily first doses data? seem find daily total doses. sure vaccine narcan insulin pop leg get COVID. want immune avoid chance hospitalization, death, hell even passing teachers people we're going get vaccinated ASAP That's like United States administering 4.7MM doses per day (which ton!)

(1.2/84) \* 330 = 4.714MM

The United States currently somewhere 2MM/day range, guys actually quite well. they're vaccinated want ready enter store. Oh damn. 250 must hurt badly. first couple months absolute haze remember terms vague anxiety. went back in-person work (at university, well-informed careful), world started feel real information anecdotal. Real statistics show Republicans much less likely get vaccine Democrats. people know COVID cautious probably 53%-59% Republicans/Trump voters get [NPR/PBS Newshour/Marist found 41 percent Republicans 34 percent independents would refuse get vaccinated could get shot. 11 percent Democrats would refuse shots, poll found.  another  voted Trump want vaccine compared 10% voted Biden. meetings planning seem dumbest schedule... agencies act like COVID came yesterday, werent preparing making recommendations. Theres non beaurocratic reason agencies couldnt pre authorized everything trials went well previous agencies authorized usage. probably can't everything case-by-case basis. picked 12 cut-off. I'm sure age-based cut-offs instead weight- height-based ones, do. got Moderna. need 3rd shot it. wife, children parents got Pfizer. amazing news. people scientifically illiterate hurts. Amazing believe mods largest coronavirus subreddit purveyors vaccine misinformation. even possible? draw labs make sure don’t antibiodies? Anyone know trial started? Trying gauge might approve next group kids. Dr Fauci ...he said wearing masks wouldn’t help “at time”, important three words. Doubt it. Lots older part age group secretly getting vaccinated already.

Pfizer already approved 16+. Lots kids don’t ID age get license. get license (not always case places like NYC). always crap shoot. claim age sort identification you’ll get states. Nobody counting pubes see you’re old enough.

It’s like something magically changes adult bodies make safer effective. admittedly arbitrary cutoff. data time approval.

I know people kids while, learning parents it. wouldn’t surprised substantial number high school kids already vaccinated… 50%+. remember gnashing teeth consternation U.S. whole poorly back January

The teeth gnashing awful pandemic response. vaccine rollout hand pretty flawless. Can’t get shots tell her? Part could simply aware much affected pandemic. example, finally able visit extended family recent get together vaccinated. Later weekend back home, amazed much mood improved. 

When you’ve year get used new normal, don’t realize crappy new normal start things would pre-pandemic. sent 18? Mhmm.  love way movie, Shin Godzilla, satirized Japanese government trying ""control messaging"" around monster attack. Here's explaining it. But, point, government fallen Kafkaesque style government prevents resolving even basic issues, like whaling. Seems mix methods Canadian provinces. Saskatchewan able book online 2 minutes central booking portal, pharmacies also vaccines handle booking independently. calling around every couple days sure going able get one province quick enough. None family shot. managed flip shit mother MOTHER’S DAY “announced” bought plane tickets June her, sister, brother come see wife daughter, autoimmune diseases. daughter can’t vaccinated yet.

I don’t feel remorse. always told grownup could make rules. Well rules don’t see grandkid get fucking shot.

Anyway, say mostly rant, also suspect brother sister aren’t simply lacking motivation, dissociated decision. see, procrastinating, defer “choosing side” mom me. wasn’t fear mom’s shit, think would probably happened random Tuesday. I've heard, fucked mom told Xbox Live.  feel like you’re ignoring numbers low vaccines. alone can’t take credit. Let’s see get us place haven’t before. Well, yeah. States started lifting restrictions children aren’t high risk. factors would increase contraction virus change view urgently think people need get vaccine.   okay lol likely less deaths due things like auto accidents, though That's lot smart people. Maybe America doomed. School requirements get LOT people vaccinated fall age lowered. Basically every district country make eligible kids vaccinated person education. there's one Miami private school banned kids staff getting vaccine. Wackos. Meanwhile citizens still stuck abroad. don’t think understand emergency use means feel like it'll increase summer swing high gear July 4 many universities colleges requiring full vaccination enrollment. CUNY/SUNY, Cal States/UCs, Mass. state schools systems require it. surprise others follow suit. I'm sure probably close half public/private higher education places don't, that's absolutely wild speculation zero facts back part. want pay anyone call fix problems outside regular working hours. think older kid, closer adult levels spreading. older teenagers (16 17) may worse mobile, school social things work. elementary school kids really bad.

Though again, also seemed change often people change underwear, heck knows. might true Israel places police actually enforcing mask mandates, much doubt generalized situations. stupid Ossining interesting choice. would issue here. bureaucracy bad going kill people. really knows? 2nd Pfizer dose kicked ass 36 hours. parents got Moderna. Dad headache mom bodyaches day. Yes another comment thread word winning... didn’t use word comment doesn’t mention it. 

Try wrong asshole it. 
I’m right, asshole. 

You’re even American, interest us kinda pathetic. Go back playing VR games young lady. Nope. r/Coronavirus users...   swear, Mom! drinking smoking sexing! End May I’m you, there’s reasonable way guarantee person insists they’re vax’d trusted actually *be* vax’d go maskless store wherever. Indoor public spaces require masks (if want to) community spread gets low enough masks won’t necessary. We’ll know it. Meanwhile Japan still distributed vaccines... real shit hole country. Isn’t exactly happening India? Limit number people get infected definitely make variants less likely occur. mutated virus likely produced long-term patients (usually compromised immune system), keep mind COVID-19 mild last long time. means important identify isolate every patient. That's strict lockdown responsible way deal COVID-19. Economy consequences covered government society. Clearly somebody doesn’t understand women go daily life Uhhhhh what. Penn station absolutely nice hahaha. thinking Grand Central? took 30 years rid United States Polio. We've never eradicated virus like this. going happen. 

Better get used living Well that's good got some. tried get one best friends get concerned long term issues somewhat believes conspiracy nonsense. got really annoyed tried talk drop it.  never said vaccinated people don’t catch covid; said drastically lower risk catching (and symptomatic do) compared unvaccinated people. think servers smart enough learn use gloves Here's [New Jersey's FAQ ""All individuals aged 16 older live, work, study New Jersey eligible COVID-19 vaccines, regardless immigration status. **Documentation required vaccinated.** Vaccine sites may request documentation, required receive vaccine cannot denied access vaccine ID."" it’s EUA, probably not. 

Also communities need uptake achieve herd immunity exactly ones school district make mandatory even fully approved. end 2021 fall though? 

Plus knows kids vaccinated. I'm reading 12 crowd might till 2022. love hearing this! actually seen article days first dose baby born antibodies one best things I’d heard long time. haven’t asked go testing antibodies delivery yet I’m definitely curious know! Hopefully next appointment bring up. Don’t live life like this. trial done UK India unable produce vaccines due material shortages stuff coming USA. USA trial yet complete. can't get approved anywhere .

See twitter thread makes wonder reported ""78% effectiveness"" Chinese reliable however. mean alternatives probably gonna like 20-100K deaths year similar flu. It’s always going aren’t going force vaccines forever /u/No-Grocery-7606 respects man’s autonomy perhaps rather views specifically

Is guy otherwise idiot too? seen crap many Indian cows eat. Especially ones city. actually answer question quip Waluigi's chaotic energy, think answer ""why not"" us longer college, live communities colleges, seen clusters repercussions happened colleges tried normal possible 2020-2021.

I live Raleigh, Durham, Chapel Hill area. NC State UNC incredible disasters reopening. Duke alright, but, private, well-funded university, lot resources mitigations fraternities still almost messed everything everyone (both university Durham community).

And alma mater NY -- tried act like everything okay mitigations, university president ended getting COVID dying.

So yeah, that's many us hesitant cheering universities 100% regular upcoming year. Yeah, gotten college experience hoping for, know what? rest lives pretty much sucked last year half too. We're boat. hope I’m able produce pregnancy then! last 2 wasn’t able due hormone imbalance I’m hopeful it’ll different round. wanna know one year old get vaccinated safely 😫 June 15 date set entered trial December. date?

Well, we've multiple requests extra blood draws/swabs last 6 weeks, never gave name this. AFAIK completely asymptomatic, needed covid test travel (which negative).

She's thrilled, made quite bit cash this! scary? Suppose instilled love humanity her?  almost downvoted made mad! remember shoot messenger lol. mess though. Parents fed hybrid model. kids even getting person teaching, zoom school behind plexi glass. cousins kid gets go 3 days week like 5 hours something day. 

My cousin says almost worse remote school even taxing get school, son desperate go back. evidence suggest antibodies vaccine cross placenta! also multiple societies recommending vaccination pregnant women, including American College Obstetricians Gynecologists Society Maternal Fetal Medicine! Must nice live first world country dont think ever happen consistently. maybe weekends. took UK long, lockdown, US 5x population ~230,000 first doses reported today last Monday, 7-day average first doses 35,000 higher today yesterday. good bump. one payroll deduction losses due 20% unemployment months listened myself. clarify, couple told physician they’d “think it” eventually decided it. doctor couldn’t administer vaccine unrelated issue case-- still real prevalent issue. government’s new strategy getting family doctors ability give shot *critical, critical, critical* next phase rollout.

If makes feel better, doctor say “more successes failures” approach convincing hesitant. It’s true life, too. civil conversation someone questions it; someone something else may tipped over, *do* know they’ve gotten shot since. It’s certainly perfect method, it’s best do. Funny I'm one ""living fear"" yet they're always visibly upset me. Whatever happened ""its stupid piece cloth"" :/ agree vaccines work ultimate goal get rid masks, trust like wearing much stop soon safe (and allowed public health authorities) so. I'm pointing really ""issue"" business still requires it, could wear one.  Hehe, want American. That's true. Happily staying alive Canada 1/3rd death rate US, covered healthcare got sick. know people making variants seem scarier really are. variants serious original Covid-19. elaborate? I'm aware issue? Tragic, letting Covid infected bodies wild like creates risk coming contact wildlife get infected. reasonable world, answer would less 1. let’s say I’ve less impressed speed FDA bureaucracy last 7 months expect longer. got date!!! Ok, deal June 15. THANK YOU. mind asking extension asymptomatic study? I'm happy think could possibly come across wrong way anyone thread mental health issues increasing pandemic. lot due financial struggles. 

That thoughtful consider could interpreted negatively. winning relation original comment started thread supporting. Keep context.. point vaccine works (it does) REQUIRING mask anywhere nothing safety theater, risk tolerance low quarantining still safest option Absolute bullshit. chance attacked negligent per capita. You’re far likely get covid even get mugged.

Wearing mask outside may necessary, doesn’t mean don’t understand science. means you’re piece shit thats lazy wear piece fabric face... case.

I’m sorry you’re fragile piece fabric ruins life. Ayeeeee Yep. going vary wildly depending live. 

I think we'll see drag certain parts country much, much longer.  Exactly thoughts! Almost everything list essentially rehashing ""problems"". problems ones experienced every country. Japan less 1% ridiculous feel like little unique Japanese bureaucracy. Lol. Funny works isn’t it? you’re vaccinated? economy going start roaring long government pays people work. know lot Gibraltar, would imagine unreasonable given size.

With 38.7k first doses population 34k, would need vaccinate 4.3k non-residents. Hell yeah, Jimbo energy tl;dr fine folks: 

if household makes $75k, expect least $600 coming in. dependent make $75k, increases $1,100

if already got first stimmy however, eligible one, double stimmies they're private business ask put mask. Really simple that. Everyone's risk tolerance different, can't respect easiest thing possible (wearing mask) go different business.  Give allocation India. need more. fear people want continue mask (which may want certain contexts) targets harassment. Thanks Tucker. Us too.

Lockdown gang, unite! internet Big Waluigi Energy Yet Australia Canada fine delivering mRNA vaccines remote regions, even given relatively lower density. make sound like something special, not. 

Don't give ""large population clusters"" bullshit. Americans live cities, like everyone else developed world. 

83% population US lives Urban area, managed first dose 45% population far means could completely ignore rural areas still ways go needing transport anything sort ""rural"" location.

Sure take pick, already started maxing demand.. unfortunately mentioned 45% coverage far... far cry need be. bigger chance homeless person stab breathe enough viral load infected area 1% positivity rate 50% vaccination. Please stop repeating falsehoods sake posturing.

You would need find 1-in-200dth person cough face catch it, 97% chance happen vaccinated.

At point wearing mask outside basically saying ""I understand science statistics"" I'm vaxed I'm safe always knew particular vaccine pretty lackluster results. Still, situation Seychelles quite concerning.  Lmao downvote want plague pushers. shit doesn’t involve rona taking has. jumping airplane parachute isn’t less dangerous without? possibility death exists either way... Name checks  alright point tell disconnect. assume people get full hours, makes laugh lol Yep! problem can't use it, issue Yes, vaccine 100% don’t want 60 something year old teacher worrying room 26 snot nosed first graders 6 hours right driving dad chemo. Yea. many. It'd based indoor mask mandate lifted Pfizer vaccine get FDA approved 4th July. ever fear monger ? people would like detailed answers broad generalization.
If get new variant evades cells big deal, get booster shot like many vaccines.
At point ever say current vaccines work one take !! highly effective.
I'm sorry us like hear truth rather see rosy picture. went get first dose vaccine human beings I’ve near year. made anxious near many folks. wasn’t bad 2nd dose I’m hoping I’ll get soon enough. Nah Florida pretty good vaccinations far expanded availability right track states, reason believe won’t follow CDC this. already allow Pfizer 16 year olds like everyone else don’t live San Francisco I’m guessing. Even since CDC issued new guidance, I’d estimate 70% people still mask outdoors. definitely feel little rebellious I’m walking around. Same. went local park day thought wearing mask since I’m fully vaxxed, also don’t want neighbors think I’m anti-mask 😩 guess you’re gonna settle dying. 😉

Anyone would look askance obviously familiarized current CDC guidelines aware COVID spreads doesn’t. friend college done jury duty 3 times 21. No. downvoted? Looks like anti-vaxxers got angry.

They also apperntally forget schools already require multitude vaccines IFR though since still beating initial surge case number yet likely   I’m already fully vaccinated kids still healthy kicking thanks ill informed advice. I’ll stick science. death isn’t effect covid. Entirely healthy people gone downhill contracting that’s people fail acknowledge.  insinuating vaccines aren’t effective we’ve led believe? anyone wants good news gone India 4 weeks. Hurray? think see point confusion, first sentence cut short. EUA seems unlikely reduce time September. See timeline.

The EUA adults took months rushed. EUA older teens took months. EUA younger teens took months.

The September timeline assumes Emergency Use Authorization. full approval, would take significantly longer. EUA authorization requires minimum 2 months Phase 3 followups. Since 2 dose regiment takes month, thats bare minimum 3 months get sufficient data. include recruiting study participants, analyzing data needing fda cdc verify everything, takes quite while. Source EUA requirements Covid vaccines: approval BLA requires 6 months+ full clinical trials. companies applying full approval adults, 5 months EUA. original EUA followed many months studies.

The expected September timeline mentioned article. Go Florida Man? weren't. 

They saying control UK not. fact deleted comment shows know true. I’d personally prefer universal vaccine open up, that’s happening. bunch public elementary schools opened hybrid person height pandemic December. lot districts areas surrounding tech companies SF opened much relaxed guidelines in-person originally promised unions, minimal warning teachers first vaccine round. Right now, districts parents aren’t prioritizing universal access reopening schools. 

some districts still closed year voted back thought adults wouldn’t vaccinated summer. don’t see vote happening 2021-2022 school year.

[polling average election day 4% margin popular vote 2%. catastrophic failure 2016 polling, 2%, there's details systematic errors polling (especially state polling) forecasts overestimated Hillary's chance winning.

Point being, polling showing 70-80% Americans willing get vaccine, would consistent errors different order magnitude historical polling people wanting vaccine majority. 80% total population July 4th would pretty incredible!   Good news

The FDA approved Pfizer ages 12 go get shots Just-in-time manufacturing approved ages 12-15 need give weeks get done going it

July would right Everything opposite said except home bit nooooowhere close buying home. 2020 essentially Anti-Success year me. Plans get engaged? Nope. Trip Alaska GF? Nope. Finish university? Nope.

* Solve climate change
* Allows time travel Japan never gonna get control low vaccination rate.  kinda incredible much vaccines developed. go history vaccines exactly flawless. Lots bad shit happened people, vaccines. today vs 50 years ago incredible. 

I surprised people grew modern vaccines different feeling. think needs level acceptance work toward. you’re vaccinated don’t want wear mask CDC says don’t need (outdoors right now), cool. you’re choosing still wear mask vaccinated, that’s cool too.  Considering science says pretty clearly risk catching surface contact insanely low there's zero reason stores still fitting rooms closed likely sitting vaccines approving using them. example, AZ stockpile. I'm vaccinated. family vaccinated. Everyone care vaccinated. Everyone close proximity day day vaccinated. 

It's over. seeing right choice. either get immunity vaccine, get immunity testing luck virus. call.  3 feet’s good 6 students wearing masks. Droplets travel much farther 6 feet one talking, singing, yelling, etc. CDC seem capable weighing risk either. lived CDC guidelines, one would eat medium rare steak, eat runny egg yolks, wear short sleeves going outdoors. CDC always given ridiculously overcautious advice. Yeah. Really makes think would happen invaded faced another, deadly disease. don’t understand point freedom can’t help like ignore it. don’t get that’s bad crack anyone history book open  hope feel like I’ve seen polling indicated big events gestures companies celebrities tend much. people don’t trust vaccine already don’t trust people. It’s much effective message spread neighbors people communities. 


It’s probably still better nothing though every little bit counts point. There’s going massive change hesitant people once, we’ll chip away many angles can.  see mean agree life risk can’t prevent tragedy happening times isn’t accident waiting happen. way prevent death. putting fence around swimming pools. Yup. way EU behaved pharma ever going vaccine cost again.

Which arguably fine EU. $20 dose damn good deal, pay that's great. I've saying couple weeks want get extra million people vaccinated need partner company provide $5 gift cards people receive vaccination site right get injection. know companies providing free promotional items people bring vaccine card, relatively easily faked. really want promotional items bump vaccination rate, present actual site.

I guarantee ton people either simply lazy, kind fence whether want get vaccine. offering small incentive bound convince significant number people go it. gotta love

Yeah I'm lovin' sucks highlights pandemic shitty. knew people early 20s wouldn’t go close friend’s outside wedding months ago concerned covid. It’s sad, people dig heels far “left” “right” way responding pandemic. What’s wrong w autism ? Same.  Next winter, might wear mask grocery store avoid flu cold. even little sick pain ass I'd rather avoid. agree. That's core problem CDC though. give accurate presentation, believing manipulating public provides net better outcome.

It's earlier guidance masks value general public, bullshit reflected attempt prioritize healthcare workers resources. get theory sows distrust future guidance. Ok thanks. Good luck, I'll hope situation improve soon! AZ less experienced vaccines. stick fighting obesity, diabetes heart disea.....Oh, wait!!! 

Never mind... Again? win lose first time? / supposed wear mask general outside US? seems bit odd thing given there's little risk outside unless crowded understand it. I'm glad never recommendation UK. whole world soon suffering least little PTSD hard times. dissonance old ""new"" way safe health. Healthy animals don’t eat Mcdonald’s Canadians live within 100km US border. clutch pearls more. First sentence , third state’s new vaccination requirement — contingent full FDA approval 

And course alternative continue current status quo campus learning remain virtual. places waiting shots… hot vaccines ;) supply could follow “few weeks shots” regimen. don’t, four-month gap shot 1 shot 2; many people getting shot 1 many others still waiting shot 1.

We may able cut gap 3 months potentially even less people Canada fully vaccinated shots; vulnerable got shots first shot 2. ""sTAY LanE, mcDONaLd'S!"" vaRiAnTs!!! parent, take precautions can’t imagine parent loses child told someone else death acceptable.

I guarantee don't. sorts wildly impractical lifestyle changes could make would reduce children's risk death small amount. obvious changes could make would children's exposure cars. really taking every precaution based principle death acceptable, would radically alter life children never traveled car never set foot road. That's something could probably achieve made absolute priority life, would reduce children's risk death.  Wife got 2nd Moderna yesterday morning. 1st half day felt great, arms getting uncomfortable day progressed. bed time, aching over. neck, upper back shoulders aching, arm injection site super sore. wife aching basically hard time falling asleep (which turn, kept awake night lol). also got pretty bad headache, not.

That's got ""increase"". data pulled last week incomplete time pulled (the 470,722 number, reality 603,231), looks like there's huge increase first doses, reality increase. pulled CDC database earlier got abnormally low number.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* According CDC site:

New cases last monday tuesday: 38,073 &amp; 32,814

New cases monday tuesday: 27,878 &amp; 22,258

That's 26.8% 32.2% reduction week!

If say 25% drop continues week week, 4 mondays cases would 8,820. Long Covid generally caused severe Covid infection. vaccines prevent severe infection even still able catch Covid, thus, little
to chance long Covid. may specific study shows info you’re looking still don’t even really good handle long Covid. coffee cups, paper bags well? getting number from? Almost entire friend circle California fully vaccinated now, able freely hang masks share food drink others' company amazing. 7 day average remained constant last two weeks. numbers look great state still vaccinating high level, still want see average 1k reason incremental milestones happy about.  people tier, huge amount people, first come first serve rather using lottery type system. advantage easier set easier fill appointment slots, also disadvantage less fair since easier get slot people tech savvy refresh page frequently follow twitter bot posts appointments available. However appears lottery system difficult set last minute, especially locality needs own, good choice instance even though would fairer. can't permanently make schools online? Congratulations! Side effects typically recede within 2-3 days. don’t know ins outs system. 

Now think it, vaccines think always free Canada, don’t ever remember pay HPV vaccine.

But dental care, eye care, medication, know free. remember even medication huge issue people know, since lot medications expensive.

And that’s even bringing horrific wait times treatments. belief based on? risk teens serious symptoms negligible. risk teens transmitting virus older and/or immunocompromised people negligible. Nope, without virus attached, basically blob protein that's floating around plasma waiting antibody recognize destroy it.

Its sole function body serve bait immune system. worked McDonald's time, loved seeing smiles people's faces expected small cone got mountain ice cream.

Parents sometimes hated me, worth it. exactly wrong? dispute J&amp;J effective vaccine require freezer? CDC site says requires refrigeration - Store vaccine refrigerator. freeze. wish would consider beyond themselves.

That's considered communism America.  Hi, CDC recommends immunocompromised people get vaccine live-attenuated vaccines, specific efficacy estimates necessarily exist populations.

With said, especially menstrual cycle differences, vaccine administered women regardless menstrual cycle progression trials, there's evidence suggest impacts vaccine efficacy all.

Hope helps! Whatever risk is, likely get less risky time soon hit point people want shot get one. point, decide want live life hide hole hope things get better.  headache 3 hours. Hm, England only. wonder what'll happen Wales etc? sounds like politicisation likes Trump led overcorrection left-leaning people that's going something fight normality returns. imagine people complaining fully-vaccinated people reckless constantly wearing masks even months even CDC says pandemic over. make chapters time done reading cool enough take first sip. vaccines I’ve seen come vials, contains several doses.

You aim QNuts Antivaxxers campaign like this. aim people fence, think need it, or, sadly, uneducated/not paying attention.

Maybe get vaccines people. Maybe people convince people, steamrolls net positive effect country.

It really take much investment part McDonald's change what's printed cup, return investment, form people actually getting vaccine (or, let's real here, good PR McD's comes it) positive. ""I gonna take vaccine, cup convinced otherwise."" 

\-noone ever Literally everyone consumes dies.  Considering felt second shot can't wait get another. LICK A*#S COVID get nanosalsa? They're pretty nescient least comes vaccines. didn’t need physical know obese. Hard say. Number factors could possible including limited to:

* Lazy people getting shots widely easily available walk-in basis now
* Hesitant people becoming content whatever holding back before
* Students wrapping school/finals time go
* big drop last week somewhat artificial due slower usual reporting
* Lots JnJ getting reported now, people wanting/waiting one-and-done option
* Shift huge vaccine centers incentives/outreach working anyone *actually* believe McDonald's gives shit health customers - *anyone*, matter?

What kind person would health decisions impacted labels fast food?

Seriously. can't fathom type person going help, anyone McDonald's could think anyone would fooled this.

It less year ago [McDonald's gave pretending removed ""healthy"" items menu *because nobody buying them*. Yep, world isn’t black white. knew? Yeah put 5G coffee?

Makes annoyed thinking people. Holy shit, 480p video Many people already swayed Facebook misinformation attempt establishment source convince otherwise confirm conspiracy mind.

If believe take look comment sections news videos YouTube vaccines. high-spread areas, vaccinations necessarily help enough go high-risk situations, imo.

Sounds like personal choice people make own. want go concert, one forcing you. Stay home instead. Others might think worth risk fun. say let them.

If supermarket restaurant wants require customers wear masks require that, private business like. people make shopping / dining decisions accordingly.

When say ""over"", mean govt done mandating stuff. People still choices make want do. Oregon  links explain long term side effects really possible? People always bring argument getting vaccinated would great information refer to. Oh yeah I’m sure that’s do. vaccine distributor actually Great news: vaccines kick major ass

Bad news: worldwide vaccine distribution sucks.

Bright side: fix issue. fortunately wrong. last stimmy income limit $30k. one pushes $75k. household made $30k $75k, get one qualify first one people seem understand harmless vaccine is. thing I’m getting is...they generally feel way Dems. know plenty open decent discussion, struggle find amidst noise. It’s difference philosophy. people treated people, “us vs them” sort way Honestly, might see tracking chips small enough one day, far that. technology have, next impossible anyone chip small. mRNA vaccines made using cell free Inside facility Chesterfield, Missouri, trillions bacteria producing tiny loops DNA containing coronavirus genes – raw material Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. better free, net savings given reduction future medicaid/medicare payouts. vaccine side effects short lived (I not). effects virus months long permanent.

So really comparable. Brother, don’t know clear make this. insurance covering it, means it’s free. way. messaging easiest. Two weeks final dose easier get cause harm. 1 week Pfizer vs 2 week moderna/j&amp;j, chance mistake

I get simple messaging, end weird situations way. instance, telling people they're 'fully protected' J&amp;J 2 weeks someone got one mRNA vaccines still 4 weeks away 'fully protected' despite data showing later person actually much less likely catch COVID point J&amp;J person still several weeks away peak effectiveness. Totally random might appreciate - took Japanese college like 4 semesters instructor Indian man learned Japanese English secondary languages. still remember stories would tell young Japanese children staring even crying saw first time ever seen someone Japanese. different culture experiences living US city.

Also, hope get vaccine soon yet.  Yeah... no. second class citizenry bullshit. long think US reaches 10k new cases 7 day average? deaths, 127,000,000 people 

0.514% audacity, try completely put raging fire back yard helping others.

your supply outstrips demand... isnt january 2021 anymore 25% introverts. Yup, thousands years now. can't argue haha

I'm area. And, much love NYC. gross place. Haha Restore travel US Germany, please. reason heavily vaccinated countries ban travel other. everyone - young children, immunocompromised, allergic, etc. decide hypervigilant want Like recently said it’s transmitted airborne particles, like duh that’s we’ve wearing masks!

There’s credible infectious disease expert would disagree Rt would reduced substantially maintained mask mandate little longer.

Key word little longer. want ensure bury pandemic never look back. want pull goalie Stanley cup final points ahead game looks like it’ll hasn’t ended yet. want america wake smell coffee Sometimes personal anxiety logic/science blend. think really interested hearing experts. expect lot people feel better give kids vaccine different/smaller dose. least one severe disease. That’s main goal, prevent severe illness, hospitalization death. Hopefully federal ban Florida Texas trying ""vaccine passport"" bans.

It'll probably take legal challenge FL/TX bans come down. 0.5 exaggeration still significantly been. Hopefully beginning end pandemic. fun watching 7 day average cases/death continue significantly fall past weeks January. Remind me! 30 days ideally. assume students would back home. got mad day county ""only"" 20% decrease week week single day. 

I getting used 40-60% drops  Pandemic means Global. wealthy countries may achieve manageable infection level vaccines continue work breakthrough variants countered quickly global infection rates come pandemic continue. cases dropping like rock, pretty high peak surge that's still lot cases per day. We're headed right direction, though. downvote want. DeSantis trying ban cruise ships requiring vaccines said serve Florida. use one without vaccine requirement, thought learned lesson year ago. weakened immune system due covid probably greatly increases risk fungal growth He's year late Another graph: 
2019 Week 17 154 flue deaths vs 2021 Week 17 1485 flu + COVID deaths.

So need 10x decline deaths. it. 


Go get vaccinated help us get faster! Everyone knows kids spread sickness every year school yet across political spectrum people desperate say Covid spreading significantly schools needed kids house bad. Even school pretty safe mask wearing distancing still interactions like transport, sports, extracurriculars around school big factor Covid spread. Omg see added old values reason thought saying 6.066 chekcs Please write political offices send excess vaccines India Redditors sense humor extreme confidence condition city they've never to. Due perhaps part people would died within year causes dying covid instead. Let guess, someone near dear stopped whining, permanently... they're refusing export vaccines. They're also hoarding raw materials needed manufacture vaccines regions. time, supply vaccines seems outstripping demand far US. ridiculous.

Also, US already throwing away huge amount doses end day. That's impossible. COVID can't spread schools, restaurants, movie theaters, sporting events thing want doing. ""Spanish Flu"", thing happened. enough wood burn dead, began simply throw river. rate decrease linearly, decreases exponentially. words takes 30 days go 80k cases 40k cases another 30 days would expect 20k cases. 10k, 5k, 2.5k, etc. There's going pretty long tail here. Although could cut short reinstate contract tracing cases get low enough. looking forward businesses requiring vaccines use services. Roll concerts, sporting events, etc. Hopefully federal ban Florida Texas trying ""vaccine passport"" bans.

My kid eats chicken nuggets, apples, apple juice. unhealthy. like teaches balance. apple juice comes watered full sugar. I'm surprised downvoted since sub really vaccine requirements lately. Personally I'm simple discount gift card incentives. guess would nice know better US, kinda sucks knowing pandemic anytime fast poorer countries. even then, likely endemic while, indefinitely. like, *the* gold standard type testing know people found personal choice how. get shot shut move on. Let’s end together, get back track Needles small tracking chips. Little things like reality critical thinking get way conspiracy theories Oh man curious work anti vaxxers so, take email HR? Seriously, quite strange comment negatively received. 

I get work home now, stay home 20 month old son instead sending daycare, spend 2 hours car day, pretend work solid 8 hours since managers around, play music loud work, go walks / workout lunch *without mildly scrutinized*, saved almost $15k needing daycare...

I lost dad Covid, though, would give everything back see again. Germany’s numbers making excellent progress. believe EU countries higher first dose percentage adults Hungary thanks additional vaccines, plus Finland Ireland following UK style approach delayed second doses Many (perhaps most?) states **did** provide coordinated, central system. States entities charge things vaccination campaigns, even COVID-19, one expect Federal government done so. ""just weeks behind"" consider ""few"" mean like two months half possible could disappear like SARS Spanish Flu did?  understand hesitancy, suggest research long mRNA vaccines studied “new” vaccines are. think research you’ll trust science behind vaccines Thanks, makes sense. know darker color range means then? guessed, absolute?

Too bad also show daily change first doses...We're 3 4 weeks peak, bunch second doses coming up. vaccine population receive? sounds like he's talking We're already endemic. Considering many people already covid top vaccinated, people going take less less reason give life for, gonna stick around See thing people total, people things like distribute vaccines. That's scale really matter regards distribution. Canada even rural US higher daily covid vaccinations. 

It really boggles mind America always thinks they're special matter evidence says. Yeah, that's exponential decay works. Based numbers would take like 60 days assuming number gets cut half every 30 days like suggesting. would agree. Hoping maskless July 4th! Okay, accept everything hear authority without questioning it. Lol would downvote comment? Trials six month olds. Whose babies those? You’re literally agreeing me. parachute vaccine. wouldn’t take potential safeguards protect potential death exists. judging vaccine rollout going, even then, probably weeks most. fully “open” fully “back normal” **Edit:** writing that, figure reason discrepancy. CDC include Texas numbers age breakdowns, total population dropped 29 million.  


Interesting. seen particular graph. using data 

Specifically, 'Age groups least one dose administered'.

Which includes number people one dose, percent US population age group (but percent uptake groups). using US population grabbed (for total numbers group populations get, ending 75% 75+, 77% 65-74, 59% 50-64, etc. I'm bit confused numbers different. 


Looking bit deeper data CDC use make chart, see using vaccination numbers pulled off. number people category off, know got them.  


Summing population age categories CDC document gets 302,988,366, lower [2010 Census 304.28 million, [recent census 331.1 million. Using recent available estimations population age breakdowns US Census Bureau [from population age band actually 5 10% higher used CDC release. Resulting actual vaccine uptake like: 


|Age|Uptake Real (%)|Uptake CDC (%)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|75+|78.3|82.5|
|65-74|80.0|85.3|
|50-64|61.1|65.5|
|40-49|49.2|53.9|
|30-39|43.2|47.1|
|18-29|34.8|37.8|
|&lt;18|3.1|3.4|

By comparison, numbers UK releases directly population estimates provided, based mid-year 2019 Office National Statistics (ONS) estimates, populations drawn directly NIMS system. ONS estimates recent best available total population estimates used approximate vaccine uptake national, regional, Integrated Care System (ICS) / Sustainability Transformation Partnership (STP) Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) geographies 

And population numbers documents match published sources. highly vaccinated countries deaths/hospitalizations likely useful data cases. September estimated approval, results would need little Glad they're delaying it, also states probably delay order give rest us older risk ever able get it. Sucks bad job west coast allowing us get it. man gone beyond get people vaccinated sneak important part end they.

Based data, Canada enough vaccines 40 million people July. opinions mandating vaccine? States mandate smallpox vaccine back early 20th century. Massachusetts compulsory vaccination. didn’t comply you’d pay fine $5 (about $150 today). guy claimed forced pay fine getting vaccine violated rights went Supreme Court. Supreme Court actually upheld law said individuals couldn’t forced take it, fined.

Could states mandating vaccine work today? (Once FDA approved course) find surprsing EU mad. really find surprising UK mad, given AZ also underdelivered them.

Considering AZ sent vaccines EU UK willing deal potential EU lawsuit rather delivering less UK, I'm sure UK complains much. Exactly. know people twenties genuinely believe COVID poses severe risk health.  pay taxes government.

Our government using tax money pay vaccine companies.

It's free. need get people vaccinated first giving away vaccines countries. aggressively targeting anti-vaxxers get shots arms, end $300 unemployment handouts get back work economy moving again. Hopefully foreign countries paying U.S. government vaccines anything. can’t afford give away stuff nothing anymore crippling national debt. 7-day average cases India fell first time wave, although tiniest amounts.

The comment initially replied said herd immunity means disappears. one case, ever, herd immunity resulted eradication, disease, even though we've got herd immunity lots them. 

This kind conversation problematic. Experts saying can't go back normal we've reached herd immunity - okay, great, seems reasonable, got conversation herd immunity equalling eradication. Eradication necessary *not* reasonable. best people say they're confuse issue make less informed believe need eradication restrictions go away; worst, experts also believe need eradication. would enable situation variants wouldn’t occur? inevitability New paper today says mRNA vaccines 4x less effective (less S.African) good.

I really think going thing, next 2-3 years, deaths statistically low.

FWIW, think reasonable assume COVID ""front-loaded"" deaths 2020 2021. think tearing nursing homes -- COVID deaths, many life expectancy already short, COVID beat whatever injury, disease cancer would killed shortly later. think Kumbh Mela bears resemblance people protesting cities hours night going home, truly live shriveled nutsack. Cause people complain fully authorized That's something considered. kind ramifications believe there'd folks poorer countries able travel like wealthy? theoretically free spots people? Im going data small portion population cannot get vaccinated medical reasons.

Who many? CDC FDA said everyone, even underlying issues, get vaccine. Go look website. There's small number people recommended without medical supervision, people history severe allergic reactions vaccines. 1 1,000,000 people severe reactions vaccines.

So... can't get vaccinated medical reasons many talking about? vaccination could performed weekends school? Walgreens couple pharmacies kind nationwide issue data reporting. Nobody’s forcing take it. society right establish pre-condition interacting people vaccinated. Anybody doesn’t want vaccine free stay bedrooms. Well think that’s mainly right cases deaths dropping dramatically, weather warming up, people getting ready summer. Half country least partially vaccinated kids next. I’m seeing real problem areas right I'd waited Kaiser, gotten first shot April 24th, instead April 8th Walgreens. Maybe check around bit.

1. ""an unforeseen combination circumstances resulting state calls immediate action""

2. ""an urgent need assistance relief""


A state emergency declared currently living emergency. Individual circumstances may vary, societal level contribute can.  Similar advice Canada (though think 30). IIRC, anyone 30 likely die Covid side effects facing moderate greater risk Covid. Get badly. 11 year-olds usually still elementary. 11 year-olds sixth grade might middle school turning 12 end year. Still bother middle schoolers shottable. range “2-11” conjecture actually studying?

I would expected something like 5-12 would guess. 

I really hope vaccinate 2.5 year old soon! summoned 7 (my name system taxes money parents saving name go college). everywhere uses database rules people obviously ineligible, probably easier send stuff let people obvious ineligibility call get coming public caning scofflaws Singapore?

We're yet though. True, science clearly says outdoors safe without masks, I’m wearing mask outside. 

Also comes dense areas you’re others extended period time talking singing risk spread still astronomically small. 

So short point, wear mask outdoors, put indoor public spaces required anymore. get it’s conditioned, happily shed mask places safe wear one. “fear narrative” real strange me. haven’t yet figured many people really love Lockdown Lifestyle.  actually joke aimed particular anti-government mindset perceive contradictions inherent positions, rather attempt making actual cogent point argumentation. Please keep mind San Francisco, lots people walking around outdoors way indoor establishment. regular streets, mean, trails GGP. lots times easier leave between.  people put stink showing receipt leaving self check out. feel bad theoretical person attempting check vaccination status. mean, Florida Sweden probably two widely-publicized examples ""rogue"" governments spurning lockdowns. think secret point. could get shot liberal state asking someone wear one.

If anything, many experts believe covid deaths probably *undercounted.* one disputing NZ well first phase COVID. We're talking second phase, one countries get get life. later summer US expect things trending towards 2019 last things coming vaccines approved 12s.

Meanwhile, side world, 15% NZ's economy tourism, basically completely shut down. Business owners along Queen Street - Auckland's main drag near cruise ships regularly docked pre-COVID complain dramatic turndown business. Resort towns like Queenstown dead.

Meanwhile, families members countries Australia kept apart quarantine measures keep abroad (necessary vax rates low) inside - like kind COVID-free prison. Sure great - much developed world months due vaccination rollouts. So... vaccine last summer. least US pretty much everyone wants access it.

2020 probably best year I've long time. learned cut hair, sons. Saved us $40 every 3 weeks. also started meal prepping wife saved even money. Thankfully built gym prior gym closers / gym equipment shortage. Walmart gave us 5 bonuses year, plus stimulus checks made possible us quite bit money saved up. Also Spectrum, at&amp;t water utlities gave us discount months.


Pretty good year even though deal idiots shop Walmart. would instant withdrawal me, plus quick call lawyer see claw back money paid year.

It’s fucked people act like that’s true people openly say “fuck feelings” politics. day going store guy said ""hey, know gotta wear anymore right? dropped mandate"" 

To people apparently free whatever want - except wear mask complete joke company is.

For faults, deserve credit one first companies WORLD develop vaccine highly effective vaccine (at preventing hospitalizations death). Obviously, Pfizer better, recognize that. Well.....Alright then, I'll say it. Yes. Yes, like mask, covers damned turkey neck filled mozzarella sticks pandemic turned double chin neck hell.

But all, wear mask reduce incidence transmission Florida. Somebody's got it. I'm simultaneously satisfied enough explanation - though that's fault all!!! - time... happening. 

So every part wanna protest say ""it can't really like that??"" stop realize, really many doses given. wish possible. I'm sure vaccinating infant 6 months covid possible now. Came across wrong!😊. really meant vaccinated kids diseases viruses nearly extinct. Yet, e hesitate vaccinate deadly pandemic staring us face... Providence jabs

Hopefully AZ really put use developing nations desperately need it. media needs panic. look site -- thimk articles meant fun. said, can't help like April 17 article title, says ""Atheists perceived fun, open-minded scientific."" ;) polling data indicate serious investment persuasion campaigns necessary, especially rural communities. Rural Americans twice likely people urban areas say “definitely not” get shot, nearly three-quarters identify Republican Republican-leaning, according new survey data nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation. Rural Americans apt see vaccination civil-liberties issue: “More (58%) rural residents view getting vaccinated personal choice rather part everyone’s responsibility protect health others (42%),” KFF survey found. (The reverse true urban residents.) group also much likely say news media exaggerated pandemic’s seriousness, Liz Hamel, directs KFF’s polling work, told shares say “definitely not” receive COVID-19 vaccine self-identify White Evangelicals (41%) Republicans Republican leaning independents (73%). eight ten group (85%) also say normally get flu what, problem going they're using masks? WTF people? Live let live. Curious getting data from.

Depends mean last summer, well where. US, beginning July beginning September. beginning end summer. Less summer peak. Agreed. not... socially great school. went university and... also great. said, experiences taught lot less bad, (in 30s) I'm pretty much socially awkward all. helps friends/etc, also helps immensely career. 

So yeah, put uncomfortable positions, helps grow. * people died suffered it
* people share social distancing, wearing facemasks, etc
* people worked contain epidemic (doctors, nurses, cleaners, administrators)
* people tried prevent COVID disease cure (and succeeded create effective vaccines).  Current superspreader spotted. freedom choose get vaccine.

You don’t freedom exempt consequences choices.  careful moderators delete post and/or ban say vaccine ""experimental"". ""emergency use"" yes agree point. think FDA approval coming shortly. NY Times Centers Disease Control Prevention released new guidelines last month mask wearing, announced “less 10 percent” Covid-19 transmission occurring outdoors. Media organizations repeated statistic, quickly became standard description frequency outdoor number almost certainly appears based partly misclassification Covid transmission actually took place enclosed spaces (as explain below). even bigger issue extreme caution C.D.C. officials, picked benchmark — 10 percent — high nobody could reasonably dispute benchmark “seems huge exaggeration,” Dr. Muge Cevik, virologist University St. Andrews, said. truth, share transmission occurred outdoors seems 1 percent may 0.1 percent, multiple epidemiologists told me. rare outdoor transmission happened almost seems involved crowded places close conversation. less 10 percent Covid transmission occurs outdoors akin saying sharks attack fewer 20,000 swimmers year. (The actual worldwide number around 150.) It’s true isn’t gotcha math issue. example C.D.C. struggling communicate effectively, leaving many people confused what’s truly risky. C.D.C. officials placed high priority caution many Americans bewildered agency’s long list recommendations. Zeynep Tufekci University North Carolina, writing Atlantic, called recommendations “simultaneously timid continue treat outdoor transmission major risk. C.D.C. says unvaccinated people wear masks outdoor settings vaccinated people wear “large public venues”; summer camps require children wear masks virtually “at recommendations would grounded science anywhere close 10 percent Covid transmission occurring outdoors. not. single documented Covid infection anywhere world casual outdoor interactions, walking past someone street eating nearby table. could move New York... Time fear walking dead? Combine Biden administration’s deal Uber Lyft help transport people get vaccinations, could significant effect lot towns. Ah nice job. Hopefully mobile units start getting people trouble accessing sometime soon India's response bad data suggest new variants making things even available information suggest increased transmissibility B.1.617,"" Maria Van Kerkove, WHO’s lead Covid-19, told reporters, also pointing early studies “suggesting reduced neutralisation"".

Of course, main reason variant exists much transmission happening India bit circular. original response comment got deleted automod essentially that.

I agree needs addressed, snarky comments states low vaccine uptake red outreach. really helpful comb misinformation mother sending effort convince get vaccinated.

I one question though: EVER past vaccine (whether MRNA not) vaccine issued population, seemed work fine, found major adverse side effects one year, five years, ten years line? ever happen?

Just want know historical basis kind concern regarding vaccine. vaccines caused side effects? know something safe tested. test long term effects need long term test. agree theory (and practice - far) mRNA safe.  minimizes potential spread I’m sure I’m ready that. lived it, don’t need reminded it. remember reading last summer, several trustworthy news sources, outdoor transmission extremely rare. one superspreader event outdoors six months pandemic point. Yet never push Americans spend much time outdoors possible, many states ended shutting parks beaches even though science didn’t support that. 

It’s frustrating. understand promoting abstinence bad way reduce teen pregnancy, it’s better provide birth control. Yet Americans told engage social activities, even safe ones, year abundance caution. wonder lot people started tuning out, type messaging doesn’t work Normally people get sick respiratory virus feel sick, desocialises prevent passing infection. regard COVID-19 happen often. this? COVID-19 produce sickness response humans? ordering eggs restaurant, ask waiter eggs pasteurized. Every. Single. Time.  real question whether keep low next winter. True, every bit helps. hardcore remnant probably never change minds.   right, virus never go away. whether vaccinate kids 12 15 make difference all. it? think Europe currently working exactly described. entirely self sufficient regarding pharma manufacturing. want, 200k? Considering state (NJ) requires license/permit even paint wall house, makes illegal pump gas, I'm exactly optimistic mask mandate ending see anybody calling ""uneducated idiots.""

Regardless, that's works.

Vaccines nature really long term side effects. Unlike vaccines, isn’t Covid (killed/attenuated) vaccine. mRNA, instructions make protein. case, spike protein. Normally mRNA made nucleus goes ribosomes proteins made, mRNA degraded. bringing mRNA ribosome outside. mRNA doesn’t capability entering nucleus making changes DNA, would potential damage.

mRNA super unstable degrades really quickly (in matter hours). That’s Pfizer vaccine held low temperature, otherwise mRNA would degrade ineffective. short time window + lack ability enter nucleus really rules risk significant side effects outside allergic reactions. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Around here, imposed major capacity restrictions ""indoor dining"" restaurants set gigantic canvas tents fully sealed windows doors could hold dozens, cases hundreds people, parking lots labeled ""outdoor dining"". I'm guessing ""outdoor transmissions"" involved nonsense like that. “As Monday, 56 cases involving people infected despite fully vaccinated, 30 local cases 26 imported ones.”  wrong. think getting people back work would cost less money long run investing indoor air quality though. Take-up worst affected groups 99% (and even 100% groups turned bigger thought) problem take-up ethnic minority groups, especially among Muslims want vaccinated Ramadan. We're much better different position compared last summer. half population covid immunity either natural infection vaccination limits virus spreading easily. looks like current trends last summer levels, even places restrictions. Yes covid still technically over, importantly last year's normal people we're better situation. completed 2 doses already. Moderna.

First dose fine, aching arm. Second dose last week, injection site got swollen, 2 days fever, week tiredness. Body ached lot also, mostly cleared. Still feeling slightly tired. People generally act perceived best interests. neighbors live miles away perhaps personally know anyone got Covid, let alone died it, unreasonable opt-out.

If nothing changes, okay decision. (probably when) outbreak hits nearby, people likely reassess decisions.
