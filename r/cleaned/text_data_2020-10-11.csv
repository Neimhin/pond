In reality... sure, folks counted COVID deaths.. not.

However, likely _way_ folks _are_ COVID deaths, counted such.  Something like baffles people think ""good causes"" exempt virus. 

Like get it, want protest. Alright that's well all, forget we're pandemic could potentially fatal. 

Can't online protest? Host something? 

But they're protesting masks. that's case let's get arms protest clothes. can't person walk nude Walmart huh? 

All jokes aside us exhausting seeing people things like this. 

Was store yesterday several people wearing masks, apparently get memo store clerks give flying shit it. 

And people wearing masks properly either, annoying. Ugh people say ""I live fear like coward""......right then, go get infected we'll see who's laughing now. I'll keep wearing mask goggles thanks.

You‚Äôre right, COVID appears significantly lethal, considerably contagious seasonal influenza.  Vs Ebola, ya, exactly.

Do scientific evidence lockdowns definitely help? NYC never lockdown, yet best rates US right now, extensive testing, people wearing masks, indoor dining limited 25% capacity. need lockdowns.

People refer GDP ""the economy"", rather large misrepresentation.

60k military personnel tested positive. 33k recovered. 8 died.

Those numbers tell us disproportionately covid affects people age. nothing mitigation measures.

It direct opposition healthy societies goal reforming people reducing amount crime/prisoners. statistics show US high recidivism rates, forcing people system, career criminals have. creates vicious cycle.

Uhm cuz im videographer? firsthand video enough, nothing is. already know answer, solution. infected back mid-late March. means I'm probably susceptible now? take moment make everything dick? Fair, Fauci also said wearing masks stop virus spread. Contextual lie not. lied. 1. Japan's data testing undoubtedly shit.
2. UK's total positives roughly twice Japan's total number tests. Japan undoubtedly could test vastly more, hugely unlikely situation bad countries like UK, France, BeNeLux. google ""BCG Many countries completely given stopping it. 

Wealthier countries capabilities stop prevents privilege always want way.

There‚Äôs *very* clear difference. niece's interests represent majority group. Sorry, try again. violent towards evil people getting caught bad.

So careful. sounds difficult. frozen veggies get sealed bags, soap water easy there. Perhaps really thorough rinse water, add extra layer like ziploc putting freezer? I'm fully guessing territory seems like goal would accidentally spread bunch cryopreserved virus items freezer. Probably easier buy sealed veggies. would Flo do? pre existing condition? forget awards! 5000 per dose antibodies really much, fact I'm surprised AZN use AMERICA FUCK YEAH rule ask 50k per dose. Seriously, close costs produce purify antibodies. I'm sorry mother. terrified parents (my father many high-risk categories)... they're really careful, every time hear someone ignoring dangers virus wonder hell want devalue parents' lives much.

I understand whole ""but underlying issues?"" thing people spout, either. somehow make person's death acceptable?? Like dad certainly underlying health issues, mean okay die fucking virus. Shockingly, value life write human heart attack. Feels foreign see issue approached properly. Projection. conservative conspiracies involving something get paid. live life way, least idolize people do, everything must getting rich. exactly think lives China? Lmao know weren‚Äôt, many misinformed individuals sub stuck April still think US bad test volume relative rest world. completely denied even existing months??

Lolz I‚Äôve got honest... simply don‚Äôt believe this

Hospitals every incentive report - underreport deaths...

200k seems relatively fair currently Shocked aren‚Äôt demanding usa aid stay home work .
Netanyahu ask $100 billion America hand local government pushing online classes covid? this? Never take safety precautions anything then. 

I'm still living quite fully, gotta wear mask. Went weekend great time birthday. Instead a
restaurant, outside. Instead inviting everyone, invited closest people ask wear mask actively eating drinking.

 Holy shit, terrifying.

Interesting equate basic precaution fear.

Adjust yourself, petulant child, left behind. obvious

There something *else* Ah, remember animal connection now! Thank reminding that. purpose. GOP poisoning education since late 70's. playing long game attrition.

Less educated voters make apathetic voters. less likely vote. one many strategies. Remember, big 2016 was, Trump got 19% vote. 20% voted Hilary. rest? Ah people jumping conclusions fraud potential. worked insurance company lie hospitals doctor offices like inflate claims. however least mass people suggest make false diagnosis. form proof must submit. ton proof submit something get money specific diagnosis. Like cancer instance. ... types people also believe Sandy Hook hoax (among many horrible things). There's level moral cognitive bankruptcy pure selfishness literally makes incapable compassion... that's saddest part. they're at, one matters themselves. Yeah bars restaurants open, contact tracing since July/August new spike started September schools opening University starting, correlation clear schools! Closing bars keep schools open going work. I'm ANYTHING, shutting stop spread thing, bullshit half measures going make difference. first world nations do. US longer. China capability anything please. glad don‚Äôt want nuke US yet. Maybe next year. Yeah travel may wrong word. thinking travel general behaviour local society/regular 2019 life. returns I'd assume flu around world would creep back normal. Might years. definitely interesting see happens. tragic, especially given preventable fate. fucking hate country (I'm assuming US since insurance, seem issue civilized countries).   wear mask office. social distance, make fuss. someone calls meeting confined room, stand outside.

And make fuss it, tell want parents|grandparents|&lt;insert frail die. Social distancing life. hell even saying? absolutely normal know people serious health conditions, unless 12 friends. Maybe alienate people point would never share information you? Meanwhile encouraged avoid getting test certain symptoms... sure seems nice excess testing capacity.

My province population 13-14 million 40k-45k tests per day. testing backlog grew much change testing appointment only! time second wave upon us!

I wonder feasible ship (expedited air) samples China testing... test results take days receive, minimum 24 hours. makes think misrepresenting numbers US? 36% pretty huge difference.

Have seen videos Wuhan lately? Life back normal, night markets festivals. measure left masks subway. news article sucks. Viruses aren‚Äôt alive, don‚Äôt live surfaces. actual research carried complete darkness avoid UV light. ATMs don‚Äôt exist sort environment. looking surfaces temperatures. Yes lab find infectious viruses 28 days. real world wouldn‚Äôt even get close number. Similar effect daylight savings switch. brings heart attacks would happen next couple weeks.  Disagree, claims made already universally understood, covid long lasting affects impact quality life. claim easily verifiable, it‚Äôs commonly accepted fact amongst circles intelligent people. democrats want keep everything shut down

It crazy Americans always think America world... like whole world quarantining kind reason behind it, muh American party bad. burn population create herd immunity 

This process even without isolation take multiple years. mutate. Think it, never quarantined common flu hundreds years billions infections still something like herd immunity. Exactly. Plus hey, Trump fine now! nothing. (face palm) I've isolated since February without urgent medical reasons although many around haven't, nope, something even single thought about. really care others doing, long infect anyone close me. 

Taking reasonable safety measures make feel like fool; fact makes wonder common sense everyone know isolating. shows quarantine, neither country stuff (masks, spacing, hand hygeine) don‚Äôt think China telling truth, saying lockdown sort things cause much bad it‚Äôs made be. things slow prolonging way it‚Äôs done netherlands causing things lot compared way done NZ example. denying it‚Äôs possible claiming causes economic mental health issues also nullifying effort many countries succeeded ‚Äúmommy don‚Äôt want sit home accountable actions‚Äù absolutely huge pans out. Looking forward clinical trials hoping another hydroxychloroquinine seized upon ""everything must simple answer"" crowd. 10-30 minutes sun times day really lot. get driving car go shopping. Want cheese whine? Democracy spoken, Israel must open now. Wait, article bit silly. Masks never protect YOU. stop infecting others washed still job. could wrong done research think masks protect wearer n95 ones again, sure. still laughing 200k deaths well. every last American died today, you‚Äôd celebrate. Like always, malaysia fine politics fuck up. simply saying high per-capita testing US compared Germany mean US actually testing Germany time.

Determining whether country good bad testing involves lot factors, honestly quite subjective. making claims that. L√úFTEN!!! Makes one wonder what's point studies condition impossible outside lab though since outcome irrelevant it?

It's like spending $200k tell defy gravity fly 8.5mph indoor flap arms 140 times per minute. actually think China telling truth? guess different views. women also treated like second class citizens. usual, religion humanity's cancer.

Either way, myself, many others, cut back consumption covid, even though everything around opened back up, feel safe trust politicians interests mind vs well funded lobbying groups. without lockdowns, consumption falling people feel safe going out. friend thinks super overblown masks bad (this really hurt friendship, btw). ask explain deaths much higher ever, say people afraid get medical help needed, fear catching virus. peer reviewed yet [this shows almost 50% seroprevalence random sample ~2000, *after* filtering known positives people symptoms. common tactic denialist circles.

 Studies reported influenza, pneumonia dramatically decreased fight control measures taken control SARS‚ÄêCOV‚Äê2 outbreak also prevented respiratory infectious diseases influenza pneumonia. Thus, varicella, rubella, measles also analyzed found dramatically decreased since control measures taken control pandemic COVID‚Äê19. Measures as: (1) whole population wearing face masks going outside; (2) keep social distance; (3) social lockdown shut schools, malls places people congregate; (4) massive temperature measurement; (5) check diagnosis suspect patients fever. Thus, respiratory infectious diseases kept lower level transmission rate compared past years. reliable source claims? partial ""lockdown"" (not really still) Antwerp results. fucked again. long many options go drink party stupid shit whilst giving zero fooks, continue rise. infuriating. necessarily. side effect corona tons people work home. means commuting. mean ‚Äúoverdispersed‚Äù?  $5 000/dose Slightly misleading.

It serious first month. serious first two weeks.

After 200 days continuous lockdown, people care anymore. unfeasible keep country closed almost year, that's exactly clueless politicians doing. course laws impossible follow, people whatever survive. 100%

In defence, European governments made exact mistake lying masks left medical personnel. 

And results clear: loads people dead EU US. much Asia...where mask wearing encouraged beginning. oven roasted brussel sprouts carrots potatoes, etc pretty great tbh. Hope avacado toast worth it, assholes. science problem, know German.

You cannot.

Actually Vietnam, flu quite common considered mild illness.

I never known anyone died flu Vietnam article news report. journal article subject report:

[Metallodrug ranitidine bismuth citrate suppresses SARS-CoV-2 replication relieves virus-associated pneumonia Syrian So, gloves next? think Chinese ""ultra nationalistic"", much Americans.

It's different there. visits hear it. rightly proud country went way behind caught western powers. sincerely belief superior work ethic, superior morality, superior strategy etc.... lead take rightful place one powerful statement shows familiar Chinese society.

They require company large enough take advisors several gotten big enough took over. number companies operate also arms length government. relatives operate medium sized companies influential party members going 'private'. yes, left wing authoritarian facism.

I'm sure would feel left wing them. operate market economy steam rolls people. tried map policies onto spectrums they'd right wing. Environmentalism argument might map left lot US environmentalism originated republicans clear cut. abandoned communism led millions starving death. Mao sideline deng xiaoping, China started moving market economy successful it.

I'm neutral China. think especially evil especially virtuous. another country. think fascism fits China negative knock it, Fascism description; Well fantastic news /s preprint happened nearly everywhere mask compliance high. obvious actually open parts economy safely, long people wear masks. youre fucking moron. look ""Social Distancing"" dont catch covid limiting exposure.

a packed fuck school full kids certainly doesnt sound like social distancing it?

fucking twat. Hehe. China doesn‚Äôt like truth. suspect Reddit overrun bots. could made point articulate clear phone. 

I noticed negative posts China get downvoted immediately. Yep, 5 6 times. lesson ones printing press get rich, keep it. quite fair, Vietnam much egalitarian matriarchal. reckon ass whooping administered moms taught us behave. I'm Vietnamese heritage btw. covid-19 deaths people taking precautions, without precautions, would much worse cigarettes obesity.

Preventing obesity fact much harder preventing covid-19 spread. need wear masks public distance easy see enforce.

Vietnam roughly size bit smaller 100 million people compared NZ 4mil. 35 deaths compared NZ 25. tests, I'm sure seen data many leaved nursing homes. regions reports may nursing homes got infected. municipality report many elder nursing homes died many infected, national level. far know. still free food delivery service need NYC. could survive without leaving home since April. Even prove sister died coronavirus providing death certificate medical examiner... 

Unfortunately medical community corrupt high likelihood prognosis false due federal stimulus bill Medicare pay hospitals 20% standard rates COVID-19 patients.

Literally, defining case destructive policies Democrats liberals. literally put lives millions people around world stake! That's unfair think are. person probably sexist idiot regardless gender. Usually Calgary, parents Kelowna area. dissertation online think read it. correct that. funny thing is, read enough comments right wing ""thinkers"" see catch phrases, talking points even specific keywords again.

So crazy blindly following leaders exactly told ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è wonder there's word that? /s lets hope forget science deniers... say? mean man people blamed poor handling even denying virus took reports, people lying make look better? mean like sudden drop death rates moment Trump's administration took over. 

Well completely absurd. horrible monster monsters would use slightly less death toll make point make sense begin with. Almost 10 times much car accidents. many people taking precautions. Letting run course would lot worse. Trump probably never Covid hospital stay cover another stroke. stunt play virus. kidding me? mean ask read something?

Amateurs! Argentina 60%. /s shown widespread phenomena. one confirmed official case reinfection: guy Hong Kong

This correct. 22 PROVEN cases here's thing: way PROVEN genetically sequenced, least twice, time....and different strains virus (to prove residual first infection.) 

The amount people multiple genetically-sequenced illnesses small. again, even lot reinfections count strain. 

Reinfection could common. could become common time. simply know.

EDIT: right commented, turns 23rd confirmed case, also first case person dying second time got it. Well, based quick check, seems like cases starting tick back up..... may still little early tell. Maybe another week Better give vaccines vaccines cause herd immunity. Here‚Äôs beloved China. 

Outrage China thousands faulty vaccines thought whole point vaccine speed herd immunity would nice. miss that. Still less testing per capita UK though happens one country happens able deal certain type crises way better country? big opportunity... Gee, yuh think? Gee, that‚Äôs great idea. else would like faked? That's 100% is. crazy. getting information go ramble posts instead ones clearly don‚Äôt accuse Well, reason covid deaths region plummeted region sees initial spike, whether immunity/seasonality/human behavior. think much likely immunity playing large role since lockdown fatigue across country set point. Certainly entire population immune, enough people appear start slowing spread. vaccines way hopefully keep way. southern california smoke several weeks Going up. Still nowhere near March levels. I‚Äôm limited lockdowns Im half capacity. I‚Äôm social distancing masks, I‚Äôm businesses setting rules. ~~What you‚Äôre describing vocal minority thinks Covid isn‚Äôt real less dangerous flu.~~

Edit: reread comment realized talking people blatantly following guidelines, saying they‚Äôre cause needing lockdowns. disagree lockdowns necessary you‚Äôre right ton people contributing spread virus Keep telling üòÇ husband? sound like him. use statistics raw numbers scary?

Don't start large parties, wear mask, social distance, that's it. never said mine bases objective truths, wont take parents values gospel. stop using lockdowns **primary way** control virus...


So fine lockdowns, primary way controlling virus.



How feel masks, social distancing, etc...


Things people limited lockdowns U.S. hate well!



Maybe lockdown haters ok social distancing, masks, etc... need lockdowns often.



But sadly, want nothing all. Completely reopen say.


They even like listening WHO. Unless think twist WHOs words fit agenda. Testing August around 750k. regularly 1 million day. Running average around 950k day.

Positivity dropping whole. Someone destroyed immune system could get reinfected ‚Äî way someone AIDS gets infections healthy immune system fight easily. someone receiving cancer treatment destroys bone marrow. people badly-impaired immune systems get Covid twice. It‚Äôs mad rare, makes global news. Yeah, way would insurance companies fall that. isolated incidents, widespread. \*yawn\* meh Medical insurance companies typically audit hospital bills. common place insurance companies receive $500,000 - $2,000,000 invoices regularly, able audit final costs $60k

On hand, invoices covid related deaths treatments overlapping covid symptoms would instantly paid without audit, even without positive covid-19 test. That's atleast $24 billion dollars healthcare sector made without audits. Realistically, probably $200 billion.

I wonder much federally subsidized insurance.

Of course that's nothing compared 4 trillion+ quantitative easement, still good profit.  curious, data seeing suggests lockdowns cost *more* lives they're saving? cause significant economic hardships, absolutely.

Are referring starvation?

Honestly asking. God yes. hear one time counting people died car accidents covid covid death im gonna scream. happned once, early caught, fixed systems put place make sure happen again. name Lonnie Norman. Yes anyone thread advocating drinking bleach? point absolutely strawman. Really? Thats great. Maybe cops neighborhood lazy AF \*Confirmed cases Good see Sturgis &amp; Trump rally paying big dividends .... read said Lockdowns stop getting news facebook. Lockdowns last resort prevent hospitals overrun, primary method prevention like used spring outside NY. Yep, irreverent powerless joke world stage. opposite America. Herd immunity? run numbers many dead people would involve? okay numbers arrived at, finally: people even wear masks. they're going 'protect vulnerable'. That's bad faith argument. someone's bussines fails kill themselves, that's acceptable you? Wisconsin Michigan. Haven‚Äôt crap many years. vaccine probably mass deployed first world. Ummmm, literally tried defeat 3 hospitals agreed upon science, word ‚Äúwithout.‚Äù Take L, shove ass loser. Young people strokes, need research article verify doctor‚Äôs saying true. anti-intellectualism rampant, damaging everyone around you. Take long walk short bridge. It‚Äôs freaking mask. scientists developing vaccine Ugh. mean say pride back January, became clear way world gonna manage contain virus, nailed prediction whole American political debalicle masks general existence Covid. 

 never would imagined degree federal government fucking response badly, amount apathy leaders continue towards general population. Like figured they'd fuck up. fucked ways even occurred me. I'm stupid ducking ducker! know! 

Please circle letter.

 idea want meany call big stupid head. hate it. positivity rate 3% puts us moderate tier... can't get cases 7 per 100k (\~700 day) 2 weeks time. We've seemed flatline 1k. 

On plus side, continue buy time vaccine without infection blowups caused reopenings like last time.  shitty situation. think one fighter jet costs 16 trillion? much think loaf bread is? Key West, regulations followed pretty closely Desantis opened bars restaurants wide open 25th. Even now, vast majority restaurants bars following CDC recommendations masks capacity restrictions. There's huge local pressure businesses keep workers community safe. 

Of course small handful bars that, I'd guess less 5. town w 300+ bars restaurants.

Our local hospital chief staff says starting see surge reopening bars. 

It really depends are, Florida massive state. FL too. That‚Äôs city‚Äôs entire population. Walgreens test anytime Reinfection shown widespread phenomena. one confirmed official case reinfection: guy Hong Kong practice helps obedient population without antimaskers, state-tech collaboration tracking app manufacturing industry supply PPE. exactly this, totally forsaken people state needs charged dereliction duty. idiot brainwashed even know it. know what, China shitty reglious groups 5 years now...ask news amplification Covid became control US US election year.

don't even realize used distract domestic problems. 210,000+ poster mark confirmed cases covid deaths, haven‚Äôt seen shadow projections sit brace hallow feeling stomach. let‚Äôs say agree disagree article utterly convinced interpretation correct, matter untrue is.

People 20s dying strokes COVID would surely something multiple outlets would cover. Care provide example states right? really get this. Sweden higher number cases deaths compared neighboring countries, Norway Denmark (both strong lockdown-like measures), due failed handling outbreak. Post-outbreak, Sweden fact made stronger recommendations citizens stay home, social distance etc (like Denmark Norway).

Furthermore, important difference political culture Scandinavia many countries/regions: higher trust authorities, people larger degree heed public recommendations, e.g. wear face masks. get wrong, I've good amount discourse multiple anti-maskers past months, genuinely like help people become better people. always throwing weird one-off websites source bringing Dr. Fauci originally said masks (when act allow medical personnel acquire enough first masks already scarce), actually listening, trying convert someone else. foundation ideas corrupt, reason unlikely get alone. Adding tiny bit emotional manipulation might finally allow see past it, I'm willing take prevent spread. Feel free label misinformation, know long term effects virus anyone be, factually based. Repeat: want end like people /r/cfs . 

Despite complete ignorance doctors, are, fact, treatments help people post-viral illness - simple, safe stuff, doctors completely uneducated Big Pharma can't patent it. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy one example. old treatment generally safe people (there clear contraindications for, e.g. Eustachian tube dysfunction), really improve quality life CFS sufferers (hyperbaric oxygen therapy commonly prescribed Europe).  Yet, doctors even mention there's anything do... 

This much malpractice, across board. People furious. I'm furious.

(Edits: grammar) Remember persons per square mile low too. idiots gathering purpose precautions order hit number. isnt....table 3 health conditions relating covid deaths Ayyyyyy, still struggling syntax. Go back grade school. They‚Äôll teach ELA. Someday not-stupid. don‚Äôt think ever smart, not-stupid, chance. UK also performed nearly 15x amount tests.

UK testing more, positivity rate 5.4% rising. Japan testing less, positivity rate 2.6% relatively stable. 

What say? means UK still needs lot glad actually managed get today met friends local gaming establishment last warhammer game. Probably year. next, nobody knows. 

Majority establishments gonna close probably open anymore. owners money. There's lot misinformation there.

Some media outlets giving credence nutjobs allowing talk nonsense live.

Seriously, nothing deemed obvious pandemic, restate fact fact keep weeds out. thoughts discard idea? seems like obvious superior strategy given tradeoffs, data comes in, seems like lockdowns effective may cost lives saving. still 5 - 10x higher flu. said another reply could tackle complicated situation like one flawed timeline. patient admitted Dec. 1st diagonalized retrospectively, meaning first got hospital, people really know infected COVID. late Dec. rumors around hospitals SARS. Next history. Nah will, already tell whole argument hanging word: ‚Äúwithout‚Äù.

Way tons evidence support thoughts, idiot. Idiot attacks syntax, doesn‚Äôt realize data still proves wrong. Clearly! Vietnam countries demonstrated! 

Unhappily US serve object lesson ***not*** üò£ think good news sense people begin following rules see govt serious fining them. many 1 25 year olds, Covid related stroke?

C)up 1000 

D) 10,000

E) None Even entire world actually thing, doesn‚Äôt make right thing do. Exponential growth.  Yes, expect unironically. rights already restricted there's still increase infections. Loosening restrictions result even higher rate infections. Ah okay Yeah....it's pretty pathetic slow Fauci, CDC come guidelines they're even correct. data point risk/protocol certain situations. mean hey, mixed swears science. focused grammar. Brain must going brrrrr right now. Oh no, can‚Äôt argue facts, argue grammar. said without, never mind numbers 3 different hospitals lmao. Stupid schmuck. neighborhood BA city that‚Äôs definitely case, I‚Äôve stopped several times driving car asked going I‚Äôm allowed get home. Continuing respond isn‚Äôt going make blatantly false interpretation article true. give up. wrong. need immunity virus end. get spread low enough community, use testing tracing, combined mask wearing keep spread low prevent infections deaths there's vaccine. goal measures, keep spread low, zero order starve spike infections hope vaccine come next months. Now, obviously vaccine off, might best strategy, future unknown strategy pursue risky right now. we've almost reached herd immunity New York, cant /s sounds like pain rear end deal with.

Lol...I attacking f bombs fatigue ignored completely. matter much fatigue people have, following pandemic rules make everything worse force fatigued even longer. 

New york things open months, talk indoor dining limited capacity. fatigued about, wearing masks? go 100 people parties packed churches wear mask. completely agree. large gatherings large gatherings. fuckers first community spread Coronavirus back March lockdowns went effect. they're going cause another wave NYC. I've got real bone pick public health experts think fucking job straddle line medical science politics. Hey, guys, there's mask shortage that's **your** job infectious disease expert surgeon general tell people *not* wear masks. problem responsibility government ramp production masks. *Your* fucking job convey information science *us* public virus works best stay safe. 
 
Instead we've public health officials say shit like ""you run outside without mask"" ""you talk people long 6 feet away"" ""you wear surgical mask safe"" - 
Al things half truths. They've portrayed efforts making people safe effective solution epidemic. they're safe enough. get infected person 6 feet away. get virus even mask. get infected guy running path you.  
 
The reason CDC Fauci Surgeon General others say that, they've sized American tolerance figured tell people stay 6 feet away, that's tolerable Americans. asked us stay like ~15 feet (or whatever actual safe distance is) away, think Americans would become fatigued effort flat give up. Effectively producing social distancing. 
 
So instead lie us. they're trying play god predict behavior be. That's fucking job. They're suppose give us data, leave us government deal it. 
 
They've really done trust deficit. intending publish data people 20s. shown researched. idiot. perfect world everyone wears mask required, wash hands social distance, could work. Unfortunately live world. BA city, live, cops dont fine people, dont that, fact several cops use facemask without covering nose. Yeah honestly blows mind media said whole ordeal, try exercise eat healthy boost immune system. know cases obesity person's control, think things would contribute far lowering personal covid risk anything else. addition, fighting covid seems like inefficient resource use time save lives. guess we'll see coming years ineffectual expensive attempt quash virus was. think I‚Äôve given many, it‚Äôs started make focus grammar.

I already party, hang Friends FREE!

Good luck living fear tho, must hard. saying 200k+ people died don‚Äôt matter? It‚Äôs bad people need know. exaggerate tiny bit, maybe people listen! THIS! NEED funding long term chronic diseases ME/CFS, well POTs, dysbiosis, related disorders. rely champions like Bath travesty... billions funding stuff! Currently people sick illnesses rely little bad information, often online forums filled people like confused, often misdiagnosing misdiagnosed spending years money chasing wrong diagnosis even harming process treatment. 

It's horrible, horrible situation, due utter lack recognition treatment chronic disorders mainstream medical establishment. Anyone illness like 10 medical doctors nodded sent away steroid antidepressant, matter much protested something physically wrong needed real treatment. great thing third outbreak contained without restrictions, handled rapid widespread contact tracing, selective isolation, testing. second oubreak handled mild lockdown one city, first outbreak big one locked country. There's covid community two weeks now, border.

Hmm, list countries like Korea, New Zealand, Taiwan, Vietnam, even China, people enjoy relatively less restriction Europe exceeds total amount excess deaths we've seen causes.

Countries done well contract trace control general spread (like South Korea New Zealand) CFR's 1%. 

Given comorbidies (looking you, obesity) uneven access medical care, think 1% mortality rate (which admit different CFR) country bit overly optimistic.

I assume CFR countries contact traced largely contained virus closer true mortality rate own.  Yes controlling travel testing, tracing isolating crucial. done though. ‚ÄúFrom pandemic‚Äù virus itself. B-bu-But protests months could derp derp... IFR Eventually gets point hate country can't stand people it. Like I'm convinced Americans worst people earth. that's takes remove Trump...

Just Trump out. *""But people died!!11!!""* much chance catching public work.

Bullshit! know talking about. ..yes does. you‚Äôre overweight like Americans risk complications death. prompted mass testing, unsure. Wear mask moron  impossible levy travel restrictions within US. matter well individual state city manages, it'll get fucked another area believe science.

Countries better strong national-level responses. Without competent federal government, we're fucked. counted Covid related deaths way smoking-related deaths figure Covid fatalities USA would close 300,000 now. take personally someone regards coronavirus response hoax, blame foster kids gave her? blew phone call back May? know infected? happened foster kids? 

I can't find stories her, even though 38 year old health conditions healthy one first couple hundred people die state would made news (and fact find bunch similar deaths states reported on). 

Plus account 12 days old brought sister bunch...

I believe you.jpg sad many Europe North America even believe elimination possible.

It's realism. People want assume costs eradication political attempt that. Europe least one country want follow cannot unsuccessful, dooms rest anyway. trying?

What makes angry despite that, containment strategies might work, nope. attempt contact tracing, protection vulnerable, social sacrifices (except close schools!), etc. wear mask f-off. ""I feel sick might corona, I'll tell government say"" channel testing Tokyo highly restricted. There's number call basically tell can't get test. Then, insist, might give hoops jump through.

This produces 1000-2000 tests per day. approvals controlled complicated questionnaire checklists.

There total 5000 tests day, 3000-ish private clinics, pay $100+ tests probably movie stars politicians etc. getting regular tests.

In Tokyo's neighboring prefectures, since cases bottomed weeks ago, there's clear upward trend. Tokyo flat around 1200 cases per week four five weeks. one exception four day weekend, proportionally fewere tests.

There's big ceremony Crown Prince, Olympics, etc. etc. 

This ""Japan's method"". Make testing difficult discourage people form getting (who already face stigma work). They've caught also keeping COVID patients ICU care special wards counted ICU. Also, rural areas, know case two patient treated assumed COVID refuse test decline report positive. stigma Japan, face.

I'd say Japan well Germany, numbers wise.

The summer season lower severity convinced Japan basically do-nothing approach way go. worry winter.

There's really plan things get bad. Yep Hopefully turn NZers getting wiped new strain common cold flu years

India think lockdown could worked population lives. countries good measure organized care. excess death rate reliable source see wether deaths significantly changed one year next. 
And see excess death 12% comparison previous years. , also less.

So yes Covid attributed measures cause excess. also put things perspective. 12% significant need panicking large chunk PPE manufactured China, specifically Wuhan. major part problem (specifically 3m's) reliance China.

What's Bill going us now?! I‚Äôm apartment building, using laundry means going series confined, unventilated areas - no, I‚Äôm using washing machine masks. I‚Äôve got bucket used masks, every 3-4 days hand-wash hot, soapy water, let hang dry.

Yeah, example comments. spreading misinformation Sweden. Yeah locking certain parts economy lockdown. Well shit cause got people going around without masks going lives matter sure arrive 10K specifically, conceptually agree  even know anyone died this?

Can't wait pandemic over! Biden wins, numbers mysteriously disappear without single thing changing. Water wet. Jesus christ! everyone wears masks probably better inside restaurant mean anything happen theoretically, it‚Äôs hard prevent indirect deaths think it‚Äôs much likely response resulted covid deaths would also result overall excess deaths. why:

1. 74% excess deaths official covid deaths article suggests it‚Äôs likely remainder also directly caused virus. get lower overall total would need least 3 unrelated deaths prevented covid death caused.

2. covid deaths means people hospital covid, reduces amount care provide patients. true even hospital hasn‚Äôt run ICU beds formally ‚Äúcollapsed‚Äù due limited resources extra work required healthcare workers exhausted normal times. also means fear hospitals people unrelated conditions.

3. Deaths directly related economic causes like health insurance loss regardless can‚Äôt tell we‚Äôd normal functioning economy pandemic going on, especially one even higher official death toll now. China large country economy that‚Äôs expected grow year despite many different responses.

4. Suicides drug overdoses bound increase stress, isolation, loss associated pandemic. different response might involve providing support people situations, would likely still increase. someone suicidal cousin (he struggled worsening depression years we‚Äôre sure current state mind anything covid) say prevention services including mandatory 24/7 holds still exist.

5. many people thread pointed causes death likely due pandemic response like respiratory viruses drunk driving. you‚Äôre response involved people feeling comfortable socially distancing partying hard would imagine benefits would apply much. scientific study published peer-reviewed journal, better nothing. I'd ears independent study refuting it.

Many people want travel Christmas see families, despite risks, need information let make informed choices. I'm sorry loss. mother law super old there's people family taking seriously all, asking we're going get together holidays pressuring attend. like ""No,we certainly not, selfish assholes!"" suckers losers die COVID, good genes like Dear Leader, fine. **/S** Chinese  true, looks like make difference 215,000 deaths US alone. one million worldwide.

This plus complacency could lead quickly arriving hospital failure field hospitals filling. could get brutal.

I believe dumb ""dry tinder"" theory. people died today could die spring. Countries locked early strongly managed Covid-19 cases actually negative ""excess deaths"" number compared 2019 lock-down measures effectively stopped usual flu season. makes zero difference little none local transmission. NO, Trump good job handling shitshow all

That depends point view. everybody thinks saving elderly number 1 priority. ""If talk, work.""

Yet, 40 experimental COVID-19 vaccines tested humans, insurance companies decades experience assessing risks clinical trials don‚Äôt see anything unduly concerned about.

Executives insurer Allianz brokers Gallagher Marsh, among leading players clinical trials insurance, told Reuters premiums marginally increased far current pandemic.

They argued little structural difference trials carried past, despite drugmakers around world competing shatter fastest time history developing vaccine, stands around four years.

‚ÄúRates relatively stable. Even year far seen moderate price increases average, higher price jumps particularly exposed COVID-19 trials,‚Äù said Mark Piazzi, senior underwriter liability Allianz Global Corporate &amp; Specialty (AGCS).

This echoed David Briggs, managing director, life sciences practice Gallagher, said every trial rated methods kinds patients involved.


Gallagher said premiums Britain, example, started 5,000 pounds ($6,500) per trial.

Total claims limits policies typically set roughly $6-12 million, depending country‚Äôs rules, according several insurance companies interviewed Reuters.

In Britain, instance, claim limits usually set lower 5 million pounds, Germany figure around 10 million euros ($11.8 million).

‚ÄòLOSS EXPERIENCE DRAMATIC‚Äô

However part reason premiums risen sharply people might expected claims trial generally uncommon, according executives. patients often signed so-called informed consent agreements, said.


Jim Walters, managing director Life Sciences &amp; Chemical Group broker Aon, said agreements outlined risks patients taking participating trial.

‚ÄúSo, know, everything could sore spot arm. could potentially die. know, would literally go far protocols,‚Äù added.

‚ÄúThose generally tend hold courts legal systems around world. means loss experience coming clinical trials dramatic.‚Äù

Claims often limited circumstances linked improper conduct trials wrongdoing, rather side-effects treatment, executives said.

Such worries vaccine race among members public, fear safety standards could slip, nine developers issued joint pledge last month ‚Äúuphold integrity scientific process‚Äù.


ASTRAZENECA TRIAL SUSPENSION
AstraZeneca Oxford University‚Äôs suspension global Phase III trials experimental COVID-19 vaccine early last month due participant‚Äôs illness brought risk side effects clinical trials public fore.

But insurers said delays unexpected, could even reflect extra caution vaccine developers given lack data COVID-19.

‚ÄúSide effects always happen clinical trials, typically mild expected. common delay suspend trials, happen though,‚Äù said Piazzi AGCS, whose main peers underwriting trials include Chubb, HDI Fairfax‚Äôs Newline.

‚ÄúPharma companies insurers alike even careful usual COVID-19 trials much stake, particularly patients‚Äô safety.‚Äù


All trials vaccine candidate resumed, exception U.S. study.

There examples recent memory drug trials going catastrophically wrong, though.

In 2016, instance, one participant died five hospitalised Phase trial run French company Biotrial city Rennes, testing experimental mood brightener made Portuguese drugmaker Bial.

In 2006, six patients required intensive care receiving potential treatment leukaemia auto-immune disease London. One described looking like ‚Äúthe elephant man‚Äù head swelled. Another lost fingertips toes. Germany‚Äôs TeGenero, initial developer medicine, folded.

But insurance executives stress disasters rare, given thousands clinical drug trials carried every year.

Walters Aon, speaking 2016 trial, said ‚Äúobviously horrible situation‚Äù.

‚ÄúBut that‚Äôs one incidents really bad loss experience industry faced. So, clinical trial insurance hugely expensive. Let‚Äôs put way.‚Äù THAT, SAY HOAX, SAY **DEMOCRAT HOAX**, liberal hoax something explicitly political.

But don‚Äôt perfectly you‚Äôre supposed 6 feet apart get dramatically less

And we‚Äôve wearing masks 5 months data effectiveness

So... wear damn mask, it‚Äôs even hard more. Likewise. safety reasons. coworkers suffered increased acne facial blemishes. wash masks. do, skin issues like them. Well, theory many people knocking death‚Äôs door anyway, (for example, high mortality nursing homes, mean life expectancy 6 months anyway), see average dip mortality point toward end pandemic over. every 1 person like 20 best quarantine still get sick overall irresponsibility government, media, society large. us population older compared many countries. that's problem right wing think tank talking points. designed help people understand situations really are. made push agenda preserving inheritance. friend, even undeniable data supported every single credible scientists earth, say **""Well, old weak people anyway""**, truly feel deep down, dont care numbers. mink less likely contract virus, deaths occur among older mink, ages 1 4 years old.

Geeze, imagine living 1 year boom, old enough die virus. :(  course should. should. countries similar death rates? Ugh know many people believe it‚Äôs infuriating. Chinese person, must thank u/Temstar here

I mean, guys, look way: care little health they'll get legs amputated diabetes start exercising, would care enough wear mask? sound like Biden Harris, hopefully nobody listens nobody listened two schmucks far.

Its fact Biden support travel closing country, locking borders, etc. fact Fauci stated Washington listen others advice, deaths would 10x worse. fact Fauci said 200k deaths going happen matter what. know, Fauci every lemon love masturbating every night?

So please, tell (you) Biden would've made things better 1) borders would've left wide open 2) ""plan"" word word copied Trump Fauci.  Unfortunately usually can't reason person position reason first place. No, sure trying get rid human drivers, thing anymore.

Truck drivers falling asleep brief moment they're tired overworked driving full speed top parked car front them, killing entire family, I've seen news way many times years.

Example: famous one killed Jimmy Mack injured Tracy Morgan: need stop letting humans drive cars soon possible.

And vaccine reduces symptoms may reduce chance infect others well. See \- less serious symptoms, fewer people infected.

It still massively help. Ah, get it! DOP Liberals want airasaulize nanobots? Haha, bill aoc REALLy outdone time. smh /s N open open open trumps fault. They‚Äôll survive small isolated clusters naturally exactly propose? saying US, South America, Europe, India, Africa need another lockdown look like New Zealand? amazing promoter marketer, innovator. 

True, part ""effect"" make people think things idea. went far even insisted name early apple patents despite nothing inventions covered. Throughout career took credit things even directly. surprising many people think created.. anything. Here's question superspreading? flu - off-season - overdispersed? is, maybe superspreading phenomenon merely seasonal.

Some speculated respiratory seasons caused biochemical changes virions caused binding tissues cooled exposure cold air. so, maybe changes make infective.

This want know summertime flu thought spread overdispersed way. Seasonal coronaviruses well. so, winter may change epidemiological dynamic virus. Well see asked proof meant like real proof saying happened circumstantial evidence.

Is Virology lab China? read extensive walk-throughs CDC(i think idk while) checking make sure competent methods passed. 

Yeah dude makes good conspiracy think purposefully accidentally made lab kinda silly we've expecting pandemic form take shape whole thing preventive. 

But legit think origins matter moment considering can't even curb America cuz ""our freedoms rights!"". beyond argument hasn‚Äôt resulted outrage many killed flu every year. People heard say like flu chuckle ten thousands vulnerable die every year acceptable. Even people took seriously beginning starting say 'oh well, fuck it'. reason seems 'nothing works, rules weird arbitrary, enforcement inconsistent...why even bother'

My family stayed inside vigilant feels like lifetime. Careful point enforcing anyone left house reason go straight rooms get new clothes shower anything else. went April - August decided loosen rules bit. 4 friggin months. US get shit together 4 months. That's third year! nation, effectively able travel international third year. one blame broken ass government point. shit like makes thank god I'm Massachusetts, pretty much everyone everywhere wears mask. liquor store day cashier wearing mask nose. One person mentioned it, everyone looked, suddenly like 7 8 people calling out, aggressively. Maybe true people say here, spend time resources looking others do. Suppository form florida today +1870 new cases. 90 deaths (7 day moving average). 


florida two weeks ago 1882 cases, 103 deaths (7day moving average). sooo. no, make big difference.  


lockdown loving cali 3114 cases 66 deaths yesterday. no, lockdowns make difference saying already gone back normal month ago? What's changed mind this? Holy fuck, that‚Äôs nightmare. I'm pretty sure problems have.... Canadian one them. get difference population density absolute numbers, right? pubs open major human rights matter? lockdown Well fuck. washed mask 2 times since started using march. many cases, cost, keeping positive numbers down. Limit tests positive cases go down. Gold has.

[Gates Foundation COVID-19 Response FAQ - Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation also mind lot first, eventually got response somewhere even 2 months sooner losing someone sucks person families involved. 2 years cut short could difference father meeting newborn, watching kid graduate, even saying goodbye tidying affairs. numbers yeah point makes lot sense human sense whether numbers happen soon later really big difference people involved. still significant try slow spread, people get finish planned, regardless days already numbered. guess since certain political figures seem die yet, downplay virus crowd again.

If, likely case, vaccines take long time roll partially effective, need plan B. Plug ears talk depressed day. dealing virus want stay ""optimistic"" solution anything. Anyone else hilarious imagery anti mask anti vax crew suddenly OBSESSED wearing masks accidentally breathe vaccine? could way lower even without stricter lockdown. Cough cough, looking DONALD think people stuck abroad semi-permanent living situations foreign work visas, made simple jump plane - talking uprooting entire life, re-arranging career, selling vehicles belongings. Agreed. definitely flopped... Im sure reason why, agree main culprit. Talmud:

In cases harm usually expected, different. written \[1 Sam. xvi. 2\]: ""And Samuel said: shall go? Saul hear it, would kill me""; Lord said: ""Take heifer thee; say, sacrifice unto Lord come."" (It therefore evident cases certain danger, even delegate religious duty fear.) fully agree NZ success story. wish possible replicate model. 90% world population apparently not.

Also, whatever reason, keep skipping China North Korea talk COViD successes. reason? live big city compiled data Region Death Rate. definition total population, % population died covid. Ex population 100, 10 people died covid Region Death Rate 10%.

I easily find Country wide data diluted irrelevant. I'm interested CITY wide Region Death rate. take total covid deaths divide city's population.

I believe city live 2nd highest Region Death Rate world. anyone figures? Genuine question:

Do adjust population size? Taking average population last five years overlaying 'normal mortality' increase (6 milllion), would expect see 2020 \~50,000 (per year) deaths avg last 5 years, \~35k deaths (year-to-date) would popn increase alone.

If add recorded covid deaths + 35,000 + incidental deaths around lockdown (people seeking treatment etc) probably close official figure.

I note see lot people saying ""missing 80k deaths"" covid deaths also.

If wrong, let know popn adjustment happens. Yeah remember days. new immigrant back then, thought odd. Oh, horse poops along big streets. Yuck ""Those would give essential Liberty, purchase little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty Safety.""

-Benjamin Franklin thing is, mass testing becomes routine, cost goes too, much less cost lock shutting business. Sydney Melbourne two populous areas Australia. fact lockdown failed means failed. one arguing need lockdowns central Australia, almost one lives.

I really time go here, I'm guessing read journalism medical research. read peer-reviewed medical research, note that, example, exact amount lung scarring happens people influenza. Or, tracked things three months. I'm human biology professor Ph.D. (feel free check post history). could go terrible media reporting actual science long-term effects been. Essentially, deep problems actual scientific research (small samples, comparative samples, following effects short periods time). SARS long term effects. MUCH severe disease infection fatality rate 10%. COVID 0.2%. different conversation.

Absolutely government tried shielding elderly. Sweden great example this. deaths neighbors, 70% deaths old folks homes. economy took hit, currently completely done pandemic (deaths normal compared Denmark, second wave) economy better neighbors.  hit herd immunity over. Meanwhile, neighbors dragging deaths years. Again, lockdown lockdown, instead getting done once. Lockdowns prolong inevitable. 

Places open economies see business. live midwest people go dinner frequently. masks, obviously, issue masks. Masks cripple economies. article. One could theoretically crop dust anti-maskers right? basis saying that. longer is. measures list going help country, region, city new daily infections upward trajectory hospitals overrun?

Hospitals overrun, never overrun live we? know from.

I live could told one knew do?

Great question, countries saying great job seemed know Ingairned response threatening illness. Lucky hell wound effective. UK free respond way, not.

The said face masks bad, told false information punished listening Correct. meant disprove tour claim lockdowns effective.

I never said lockdowns effective, said necessary trying bring unrelated points distract discussion hand countries disproving claims lockdowns effective.
 
No they're not, would case made claim, disprove non-existent claim. Sweden almost 5,900 deaths.

They said plan protect nursing homes completely bottled it. Saying oops, bad event cut I'm going say best approach there. 

As Scandinavian Nordic countries opened borders asked Swedes stay right time did.

Also Vietnam way better one starters given results spite almost 1000 mile land border China almost 96 million high density population. Curfews shutting cram schools lockdowns. Korea never locked much Asia everywhere much better results west. Targeted restrictions masks work. clear. Irish lady Korea (she teaching English) pretend like idea talking mentioned Northern Ireland. hushed voice (very seriously) said never say words controversy. assume that's usual definitely see lot Irish people ""Northern Ireland, that?"" joke. much :( title already told thread about.

If like Gates exactly forcing click article read it?

Here's couple links Listen, post incivil way. thing needed break paragraphs. Unless talking connection obesity severe illness incivil. Every time get needle faint. vaso vagal syncope reaction it. Unless reason send adrenaline pumping, faint. Always. 


The amount freaking nurses trying snap faint damn high. think I'm kidding they're throwing ice packs asking know name stuff. 


So anytime need Needle, hype moment me. hear maybe nasal best ever. Especially since I'm strong wise help others shots AKA kids. else would churches get sweet tithe income? Look test adjusted adjust testing, drop nowhere near much. Math conspiracy theory.  rich ignore advice even though one well informed people planet. man whenever get shots, feel little poke..amazing peoples nerves different understood words. No, work. basically Western Europe since relaxed restrictions Covid coming roaring back. saying thsn 280k people ( normal amount) would dead normal mortality, except shutdown kept safe, right? Can't tell I'm supposed think that's reputable news source joke. I'll give benefit doubt say latter. yet that's still LESS creepy Trump's official plan spending billions taxpayer dollars turn guy Facebook frustrated nearly abusive ENOUGH user data, started company literally named evil seeing eye Lord Rings.

I'd rather data hands black market hackers. might lowest flu season people wearing masks last year, yes even USA BLM protests spread virus, Pro-Corona-protests spread virus places locked virus event. (from memory). Clearly caused lockdowns. duh. /s work Wendy's 8.70 5am 4pm 6 days week. Depressing knowing much shit I'll thankfully land lord good hearted lady. Yes. Canada right deny citizen entry country reason. happens vaccine 50 60% effective? Even everyone vaccinated freely perhaps force, still sizeable susceptible population. really. Less people means less needed. instance county country shut site low use. There's difference conspiracy legitimate less people getting tested Please obey get trouble. Oh do. Ok came said lockdowns hurting us. 


Is Gates even listening science? shit. think we‚Äôd closer 100k deaths even better leadership planning. There‚Äôs much realistically done. average response yielded average amount deaths, 50k math. top this, need account size predisposition many Americans whatever want cause ‚Äúmug freedoms.‚Äù Trump didn‚Äôt create people, enables makes worse. say all.  choice. stimulus federal unemployment benefits. State unemployment running fast. jobs except $24000 entry-level manual labor part-time variety. people might owe 10 months rent said done. Car repossessions allowed since end July. It‚Äôs royal shit show. Huh?

What even mean? point Europe enforce strict lockdown could reach zero cases anyway. amazing anti maskers wear mask stop deadly virus would wear mask stop vaccine going nose Yeah whatever fella get upset read. Also, perhaps chill challenging internet strangers duels. Makes look bit unhinged. Edit: see removed post challenging duel swords daggers. Good choice. Everything people want come back happened black death, spanish flu, Hong Kong flu, WWI, WWII, holocaust, AIDS, polio, yellow fever, SARS-1, smallpox, *onset Coronaviruses circulation* thought caused similar outbreaks 18th 19th centuries. 

Sure, may *modest* changes things next couple years, less Summer/Autumn '21 I'm thinking one's daily life basically pretty '19 familiar. 

""I want guarantee everyone, get this, get back normal""- Dr. Anthony Fauci, 2020, WaPo interview. true. Italy? surprised, sadly. really amazing see China takes potential outbreak seriously.
I mean mass testing less dozen known carriers?
In one particular rich country, would probably refuse test, unless symptoms, even would need scheduled. faith. app mandatory. want constituents ""blessed"" it... always case. nothing new. Link? Gates lost credibility. Nobody listening. Denmark total mortality lower period, last year. Yes, Canadian citizens come go please, must quarantine 14 days arriving home. I'm sure that, think I've read article said asymptomatic carriers MIGHT less infectious, based something like mathematical model analyzeing current data. 

However depends, individuals r different, asymptomatic carriers could also super infectious, check news late Jan early Feb, girl returned home Hubei, infected like dozen family remained asymptomatic long time (maybe never show symptom) . really freaked time cuz realize even scientists n doctors knew little virus. 
 
Then 5th version National COVID19 Treatment Manual upated 5 Feb, confirmed asymptomatic carriers could also infectious 

So, imo answer would MAYBE, would  recognised FACT now, cuz FACT needs scientific evidence. 
Right cautious conclusion asymptomatic carriers r infectious know r less infectious point shifted, directly argued said possible implement test trace, PPE, etc. without lockdown.

It longer is. measures list going help country, region, city new daily infections upward trajectory hospitals overrun?

The option We've come already lengthy lockdown cases lower.

Who we? know necessary, people told instead. Also, know, necessary now.

How could told one knew say people know Japan, Korea, etc. therefore lock down.

Ingairned response threatening illness.

Lucky hell wound effective. UK free respond way, New Zealand prove rule lockdowns necessary.

Correct. meant disprove tour claim lockdowns also addressed point human rights.

You specific enough address. try though.

You trying bring unrelated points distract discussion hand countries disproving claims lockdowns effective.   asking me? I'm epidemiologist. I‚Äôm lucky grandma nurse directed rheumatologist accepts science post-viral syndromes. I‚Äôm diagnosed UCTD recurrent EBV. Right skin foot dying places hit EBV-related mosquito allergy. It‚Äôs terrifying. recently found EBV MS brains think 1-1.5% cancers caused EBV. can‚Äôt wait vaccine EBV; don‚Äôt want anyone else suffer like this. hope COVID push research further. also primary dysautonomia COVID causes secondary dysautonomia I‚Äôm remaining hermit don‚Äôt die way would traumatize COVID medical team even usual. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs option? heart exploded, fuck?‚Äù thanks! I‚Äôm good. I‚Äôm going bit crazy I‚Äôm good. Really. realize masks widely available public prevent infected people spreading? Science fast. got used findings hands. whole world seeing science made bambling cuz never imagined slow process. virus spreads insanely high rate healthcare systems massively overwhelmed cannot cope. hit bus, one's coming - there's one left come, that's point trying control it.

## Abstract

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), causative agent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), enters host cells two main pathways, involving key interactions viral envelope-anchored spike glycoprotein novel coronavirus host receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). date, SARS-CoV-2 infected 26 million people worldwide; yet, clinically approved drug vaccine available. Therefore, rapid coordinated effort re-purpose clinically approved drugs prevent disrupt critical entry pathways SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein interaction human ACE2, could potentially accelerate identification clinical advancement prophylactic and/or treatment options COVID-19, thus providing possible countermeasures viral entry, pathogenesis survival. Herein, discovered Ambroxol hydrochloride (AMB), progenitor, Bromhexine hydrochloride (BHH), clinically approved drugs potent effective modulators key interaction receptor binding domain (RBD) SARS-CoV-2 spike protein human ACE2. also found compounds inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection-induced cytopathic effect micromolar concentrations. Therefore, addition known TMPRSS2 activity BHH; report first time BHH AMB pharmacophore capacity target modulate yet another key protein-protein interaction essential two known SARS-CoV-2 entry pathways host cells. Altogether, potent efficacy, excellent safety pharmacologic profile drugs along affordability availability, makes promising candidates drug repurposing possible prophylactic and/or treatment options SARS-CoV-2 infection. relate this, can‚Äôt pinpoint time switch flipped, feel stupid get older. tolerance look like? Vasovagal syncope? Happens lot blood draws. ‚Äúperfect‚Äù job stopping first arrives, unless exceptionally lucky exceptionally competent (South amores), come back anyway. delays inevitable (at massive costs). cant wait hear anti vaxers come now. think largely responsible peak-then-recede effect geographic region... masses asymptomatic cases acquired immunity coronaviruses, pool victims pretty thin geographic regions significant outbreak already.

That's working here.. massive surge July so, fell people started partying like over... I'm thinking we'll see another little wave two clusters happen multiple minor outbreaks... I'm pretty conservative/paranoid analysis things, always side caution.. simply put think huge winter wave cases going materialize.

This thing going slow-burn across counties mid-2021, then.. well.. life goes on. Around supposed open phases, soon lockdown eased, open season anything want. There's detailed plan, nobody cares. whatever want, bawl like babies someone tells can't. think believed lies Australian prime Minister. Nope, investigation pushed investigation eventually everybody agreed to. investigation standard protocol China never opposed it. said coming since beginning, long Australia. World Health Assembly passing formality.

The Australian prime Minister ws quite savvy. pushed inquiry targeting China time Pompeo pushed lab-made conspiracy. World Health Assembly passed inquiry everybody, claimed political credit.  Thanks Bill hear one nerd Ignorance doesn‚Äôt kill literally though. Following. watch sad agenda slowly fail next months üòÇ  usually run fevers get body aches pretty miserable days.

This uncommon basically vaccines. immune response means working. people react others. 

It would likely worse inhaled one virus active work. Many modern vaccines actually real virus injected, modified replicate times dying. unglazed one would need replication cycles far less virus would make body. know that?

And even that‚Äôs true it‚Äôs still really fucking annoying see. thought act like over? Strange Bashing heads walls works best No, youve duped CoronavirusCirclejerk troll.  do. Whether small huge, reports say many people virus still suffer internal damage one way another. 

At worst, lung damage, scarring, heart issues, heart damage, brain damage, etc. 

At least people also short breath hard breathe properly, move around properly. 

Most family members either infected/exposed. live mom hardly leave apartment, take necessary precautions. Yet family members got virus one way another--my uncle cop got it, spread wife possibly three cousins, one syndrome. 

My uncle caught partying. son, cousin. 

They reported us breathing issues. 

And we're worried aunt daughter (not mention son) exposed. 

Not mention even take account distant family live different states us, got infected/exposed, otherwise hundreds thousands people. 

Majority says yes. suffer side effects one way another, long lasting. doesn‚Äôt matter though. long hospitals aren‚Äôt overwhelmed, doesn‚Äôt matter. Unless really think good vaccine coming. Eventually need get herd immunity. Gotta rip bandaid bit. reality semi-shutdown. know echo chamber sub feel like I‚Äôm taking crazy pills reading post. can‚Äôt actually believe New Zealand comparable states right? country origin context? height first wave, looking dire. unlike Brazil Chile, apparently reported number deaths matches excess deaths data, Argentina one clue actual death number, especially provinces. minks got infected Fur Farms, tens thousands minks bred kept tiny cages close together giant barns. caught human workers. think interact humans enough nature make difference. ultraorthodox Jewish communities spreading disease like crazy

I would question generally living area, isolated rest. use masks take public transport stores/supermarkets, required. much interaction city residents Orthodox Jews. still scares virus. wish media would talk maybe people would take bit serious. likely. Yes, looked bit like google images mutton hot pot shows, bit taller colourful. Like blue one went villages around Jimo, visit fruit production. Us = people recognize obvious. actually 200,001 ‚Äúmy parachute slowed rate decent, take now‚Äù hypotheses. could stay home harder swear would. comes global agenda one government right, change said, addressed that, cases much higher we're issues appears everything worked.

Things fine though. Deaths also starting increase UK. People still getting sick suffering miserable disease fill hospitals. mention organ damage heart, lungs, kidneys, olfactory senses, reproductive organs.

Anyone familiarity risk management understand severity unknown threat choose ignore warning advised said thing.

Then try change subject instead answering didn't

Then answer question said instead changing subject UK told you.

As badly representing statements, cannot take word UK statements is, Human Rights non-negotiable yet trying scrap them. Also phrase everything like fault, vote evil Conservative party.

And yet arguing tactics would immediately restored rights.

Sometimes make temporary sacrifices greater good. think would surprised many rights military restricted pledge protecting rights. level late January China manufacturing plant managers called said shit getting scary prepare.

My wife, youngest daughter asserted family left around end Feb bug location. 

I stayed back company 6 children first marriage 50/50 custody.

I brought wife daughter back June/July realized gonna drag well 2021. great test run 4 generations family preps. Still making, staying home 95% time. going necessity stuff like fuel picking kids. 


People give damn though outside Dallas . analogy isn‚Äôt ideal

Honestly, think it, identify it. want seem insensitive comparing Zuckerberg's negligence trans-atlantic slave trade, I'll say anyway.

Zuckerberg conveys zero social responsibility towards anyone shareholders, allowing entity become may, based solely demands shareholders. Even users **commoditized**, welfare, ignored entirely. Toxic misinformation privacy rights problems. answers shareholders.

James Stuart, governor (like CEO) Royal African Company, held zero responsibility towards native Africans nearby EIC ports set England India. idea **commoditizing** transporting North America, seemingly infinite resources needing labor extract them, something find trace apology for. This, despite fact known philanthropist. Also, **New York** named him.

What company **can commoditize**, feel concern. reap rewards, next guy hired it. Hence, nobody feels responsibility. know anything natural history disease, know unwashed groceries thing really spreads. employees Wal-Mart Target getting sick great numbers? No. primary vector spread close contact someone ill talking loud singing. live sick person.

Mask absolutely necessary. respiratory disease primarily. hydrochloric acid stomach kills it. Pretty sure well aware deaths lage infections quite bit usually live near streets they? Seems like win win homeless step tent get vaccine. Definitely misleading. deaths people avoiding hospitals, suicides related issues poor governance actual disease. Get tested. What's like willfully ignorant? Same, I‚Äôd assume it‚Äôs big droplets would make mask wet. words spit aerosol droplets. advice comunicate bash heads wall hopes jars sense them? He's actually fear-mongering, pure trolling. He's lockdown skeptic trying get circlejerk going skeptics downplay virus comments.  tried clean groceries first started, can't it. try wash hands handling packaging. Kristi Noem met devil crossroads traded soul shot fame political power. blood hands. Snorts. Well course. Driving restaurant wearing seatbelt less safe staying home... Knowledge power. 

If power use knowledge, knowledge still powerful known rest us. homeless? businessinsider.com may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Thank helping us keep information /r/Coronavirus reliable!


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* high positive rate, maybe testing showing frank symptoms. makes wonder asymptomatic.

Argentina, unlike USA, printing press goes brrrrrrrr, may unable test everyone. someone asthma want say something , someone brain fog throughout life (adhd). Learning slow doesnt mean stupid. therapy really useful :). anyway, good luck!


Edit:any drugs available? Afaik sct similar symptom adhd certain adhd meds available patients too. ‚ÄúUs‚Äù sad coordinated trolling effort? Lol willfully ignorant. enjoy ur journey, guess u mean mutton hot pot(North China style) ? little correction Jimo district,administrated Qingdao :), mistake Jilin Province ( Northeast China)   know I'm thinking way left field this, thousands mink dead? Outside obvious death toll already humanity, something need concerned with? know I'm probably making much sense here, mass death mink going effect humans too? Unless creates breed super mosquitos can't stopped. really. us enjoying it.

The nurse 53 years old, can't remember patient said left room. That's pretty bad. nurse, asked food pain medicine. would bad you, forgot right away said. No, pretty sure federal government's job coordinate  national response. states forced step due leadership vacuum. lethality rate actually quite low issue rate spread ridiculously high?

This mean COVID-19 dangerous. would rather high lethality disease low spread (ebola) spread community opposed higher-than-the-flu lethality disease high spread (COVID-19) spread community. former much easier contain latter result kills much fewer people. bleach deaths? Yeah . mentioned months back Add relatively lighter vers brain fog, still wont wish worst enemy: bcos amount inconvenience life endless people never understand went thru discriminate you. FYI, change accounts every 90 days op sec reasons. really dumb keep social media account tied person. 

Reddit leads people talk real life. want reddit comments tied professional reasons - profession kick people heterodox beliefs. 

So, yeah, account new. use VPN. few, basic things - especially dissent mainstream beliefs - taking non-trivial risk.

I afraid doxxing Covid bananas. Years divisive politics ignoring quality education killing people, ftfy see threads discussions becoming less popular. Maybe people bored it. 2nd wave begin fall? Maybe bring people back carrying? heard one idiots rant increasing minimum wage would mean would working $1 hour minimum wage gone school CNA certificate. literally dumb understand wages would increase. forget explaining percentages, currency multiplier effect, progressive tax brackets. 

I'm even sure education would help. Maybe simple videos cartoons? Remember decided THOUSANDS died Puerto Rico hurricane, really guy said theoretically could have? awesome.  Unfortunately, best solution misinformation ignore it. form censorship, matter well-intentioned, backfires results Streisand effect. There's need adjust test rates. there's less people need tested, cases went down. course test would cases, fact need test means there's less spread. could use argument virus. Well flu really go test less. Unless less people actually need it, there's need run test. Lol sorry need unfollow sub. Mostly useless info everyone blames trump. want gross dirty, you. going continue cleaning ppe.  Sucks Covid That‚Äôs coronavirus work corona, never knew mink farms existed. want minks escape farms run amok idiotic civiliation revenge mink farms. winter scarves wash every use. wore mask hours, would wash it, usually 20 minutes pick groceries. somewhere longer, wear single use, surgical masks they're effective regular cotton. trying change said? said cases, deaths.
And yes, deaths lower understood virus less. Death negative outcome though. Especially hospitals end overrun again.

You're right, change said, addressed that, cases much higher we're issues appears everything talking WHO? feel like flailing here. Start posting sources much disprove you.

The advised said rude keep insisting one thing pretend really meant something else every time proven wrong.

I Ok, change reality said. Again, outliers make rules. ever rigorous science statistics class? feel like either understand basics ore continuing act bad faith.

You said ""They necessary prevent hospitals run much Europe learn guys shape up."" provided working counterexample. Clearly necessary ways (Sweden) avoid No, clearly stated two months lockdown everything would go back same. Again, say mean instead trying retcon everything clear incorrect?

Everything going back same, lockdown, they're saying again, everyone shut properly reopened properly, could like them. But....

And is, Human Rights non-negotiable yet trying scrap them. Also phrase everything like fault, vote evil Conservative party. think people waiting current gov changed like dirty diaper. Look resorting condescension instead admitting wrong trying lie now. see sarcastic. Hard tell sometimes Brain fog, depression, lethargy also symptoms long term lockdown measures, fear, isolation, despair. trying discount covid symptoms. trying bring light matter largely ignored  Oh, meant onset h-POTS (there‚Äôs response explains h-POTS more). 

There another kind POTS though called neuropathic (very similar normal adrenaline). Unlike kind have, gradual known cause, neuropathic POTS often begins response physical trauma, like surgery, childbirth, *an acute viral infection*. feeling we‚Äôre going see people diagnosed POTS next years. Unfortunately, rather unpleasant experience regard. Me, dad, brothers celebrating older bro‚Äôs birthday, figured we‚Äôd relax, drink beers, watch movies, good time. Unfortunately, forgot anti-mask brothers were. one point, tried get take mask ‚Äúloosen bit,‚Äù never mind wearing mask because...hey, never know, right? tried tell leave be, didn‚Äôt want get argument, etc. kept resisting, pulled aside, tried tell old propaganda seen heard Trump, Facebook, Fox News, etc. ‚ÄúCovid like flu!‚Äù ‚ÄúBiden suffering cognitive decline, can‚Äôt trust him!‚Äù ‚ÄúMasks don‚Äôt work anyway!‚Äù Even true would fine even caught Covid, mean WANT catch it, let alone pass others. knew gonna listen matter what, BS. point, also pissed around longer, knew blow them, would make things worse. finally went, ‚Äúfuck this, I‚Äôm going home.‚Äù tried keep leaving, even dad tried tell things heard. pissed off, mood trying convince of. pulled away him, stormed away house. didn‚Äôt even bother wait drive back home, called Uber, complete dad telling ruined whole evening stuff. didn‚Äôt turn back, waited sidewalk ride come pick up. fun night me, say least. (I wish making up, nope. actually happen me) one idea real numbers China. Save, perhaps, small number senior party members. policy made using China example.

Vietnam never national lockdown. strong targeted lockdowns. 

NZ lovely country seems done well useful comparison anywhere that's obscure island middle nowhere. little knowledge dangerous thing. That‚Äôs wild. Maybe fewer people roads creates opportunities reckless drivers take dangerous risks themselves, surely can‚Äôt outweigh sheer reduction hours driven overall population? think people avoiding taking normal care doctors, putting surgeries, added life stress pandemic, obvious- coronavirus, attributes spike. like reports deaths comparison prior years- deaths without monitory incentives call death virus caused. agree China success. I'm bring I'm lazy argue believe China's lying. actually agree extreme measure locking people Wuhan. Blame govt, sure. Blame asshole neighbors though. think plagues us goes away vaccine? HA! Hi you! wanted say love city! absolutely beautiful, clean safe. food amazing, ate goat first time (made Vulcan resembling cooking equipment table, boiling broth vegies) loved it. also traveled Jimo province. I'm hoping back one day, take care. Greetings UK. government compensating them. It‚Äôs can‚Äôt money life much dead gravely ill people. That's sad, taking serious still got it, probably got infected outer surface PPE protection. Everything comes mouth irresponsible. Everyone knows Covid-19 two weeks retirement. big jump mortally rates. shifting deaths covid.

I hate post thread people open opinions popular vote, happen know fact ""covid deaths"" actually covid, causes. happened old folks home person died non-related covid death, marked ""covid death"". happening everywhere. terrible covid numbers, also families deceased. Depends where. Canada big place. Toronto surrounding areas currently. cases going Read article, headline *200,000 deaths elect criminals, nobody innocent. entire public becomes complicit. terrible testing initial peak. Comine better treatments better understanding, well younger people getting sick deaths lower. says lot many governments

the response abysmal IMO

You GDP want, without right goals right executives moot

Also, population amplify chaos.. ah see thing brother have. two degrees, none yet everything say wrong ""he knows people work that"" somehow say exact opposite scientific consensus.

He's tried tell pyramids way older Egypt idea built them.

That M-16 AR-15 basic gun different. 

He 9/11 truther long time, bring idea still is.

He's told can't vegetarian body **needs** meat eat meat every day feel huge difference energy.

He's said numerous things bit wrong, correct says *yeah that's said* say *""No, said X""* says *""No didn't""*.

He literally frustrating person talk ego fragile never wrong. take care people, often line life death people. organize fight better future. Hell, point, really got lose? end, need (hospital administration corporate shareholders) depend everything. I've got ask, really power here? Perfect time Cannonball Run work Darwin Award.  brain fog cancer treatment. forget words, forget stuff like putting washing dryer put dishwasher open mid cycle. realise forgotten things fuck come across later. Brain fog weird super frustrating. Yeah, I'm one dumb Canadians flew States, maintain good reason: marry American fianc√©e, could extricate increasingly dystopian place.

Anyway, emigration definitely another point brain-*loss* column USA, risking health American airports, plus two-week quarantine upon return, fair price pay exchange lower-stress future Canadian. Yeah makes look like doubled Well see alot cases mentality regretting afterwards love ones got it.

Good luck mate Eat rich. wonder per state deaths look like. Many likely going surprised.

It take years determine total deaths, unless they're ultimately estimated like yearly flu deaths. right. Covid paranoid babies disagree  think already it, hence anomalous cardiovascular pulmonary issues posted  Ah, got it. bad. We. Know. Vote out. Never even got stimulus check I‚Äôm ineligible unemployment/ unemployment won‚Äôt go through.

I couldn‚Äôt even splurge impulse buy like people did, let alone go Disney. I‚Äôm ashamed state country. I‚Äôm tired staying inside day working. need fucking money people‚Äôs stupidity literally causing starve.

I would fucking RKO Mickey Mouse ever saw him. Sometimes feel light-headed wear mask. Haha many 1-25yrs olds die provide sufficient data believe? 

Bec apparently many deaths US due covid. still believe HAHA. virus active china 5 months major action taken.

We hit 80k 3 months precautions taken. measures taken enough taken late, still.


China population density 4x higher United States, significantly lower public hygiene standards. also rely much public transit.



Can honestly say makes sense November-March 84k people would died COVID China? make sense all? But.. people burry family backyard. Like someone dies house someone going find figure why. gently pushed hand pocket pulled last one out, trembled first clung hand.

Real title mention something science denial. seen studies showing low 0.2% official death toll US still 175k, read Danish newspaper 215,000 Americans died year year before. official number probably 50k now. unlikely covid then, rash lasted seven months, that's typical covid patients rashes stick around, I've never come across rashes months even listening long haulers. I'd definitely also talk doctor ever comes back. Also, advice cautious doubly applies lying issue could potentially make reinfection bit likely affects immune system. Still likely, err side caution. yet people still brazenly declare everyone expected know what's best themselves. I'm sure never forget Dr. Fauci recommended people wear masks early on, even prevent panic shortage.  Tokyo *metro*- whole metropolitan area nearly 40. tokyo alone meant. Canadians banned gathering other, right ? isn‚Äôt thankfully. I've got minor claustrophobia trigger asthma (also severe) mask definitely makes sweat bit minor thing go prevent horrible permanent damage death around can't fathom people fucking dense. 

Wear damn masks people don‚Äôt outweigh COVID deaths part big picture. It‚Äôs interesting look rates go go pandemic. things even smaller 0.3 microns test masks actually blocked BETTER.

That‚Äôs reason test 0.3 microns, it‚Äôs ‚Äúmost penetrating particle‚Äù size. Yes, China right idea. countries massive embargo backs. live Cuba government wants dollars price buy food. tourism fell knew coming. Im pissed current government made mistake, depend single sector economy. First sugar, soviets tourism. always fuck up. Maybe single coin improve economy bit without tourism going really hard. doesn't. use analogy. would question generally living area, isolated rest.

They hermetically sealed bubble. dominate certain areas like Borough Park parts Crown Heights, cross street plenty non-Haredi. no, wearing masks stores public transportation. Many feel herd immunity areas got hit hard March April. believe people earlier made public. boyfriend headache weird rash taste anything breathing bad. thought asthma flaring doctor insisted flu.

I dont think ever know deserve know severity it. Oh, Bost real piece shit, I'm told they're essential workers. Canada releases Meng Wanzhou, would violation treaties. Also can‚Äôt decide release detained suspects investigations court cases ongoing. Due process respected government interfere courts derail legal processes. We‚Äôre Canada, U.S. I‚Äôd you‚Äôve ever neighborhood would understand California knows get work done, wonder they're world's fifth largest economy. False, okay. Everyone work like that. Worse still, boss caught made it, he‚Äôs saying shit like that. Ffs study pseudo-scientific b.s. shit-canned forgotten. Unfortunately b.s. headline remain alive pointed hand wringers confident one ever dig up.

This play done again. CFR like 10x higher. IFR least twice high: putting everyone ventilators, hospitalizing immediately without hospital room, dex remdesevir. spreading fastest nursing homes.

Good analyses time puts IFR anywhere 1% 1.5%, possibly 2% places. analysis done today harder seems tend toward 0.7%. (In developed world. )

It's actually possible ratio considerably higher 2x. really data tell. football analogy demonstrate risk others? Typical leftist. [Except that's true deaths higher year previous ones. head vaccine task force said plan always vaccinate need it. 65s, health workers existing conditions. 
Less half population. It‚Äôs risky everyone else. football analogy demonstrate risk others? Fatal car accidents happen people driving fast. roads packed people drive fast.  likely dramatic reduction accidents consistency deaths (if slight uptick) everyone drive 80 mph every stretch freeway. lung problems can't wear mask, exactly kind person can't afford get corona least didn‚Äôt get virus .6% mortality rate, rather starved death 100% mortality rate. USA: 30+ cases single White House event contact tracing all, let alone mass testing No, misunderstanding study. virus around long enough study similar studies done enough evidence prove 4 months. time frame lags start pandemic needed figure looking immunity, make study design, get enough sample size look at, still need process data stage. all, immunity study actually moved remarkably fast, 4 months solid data analyze moment.

This mean immunity fades 4 months. means evidence suggesting LEAST 4 months. We'll know suggests 5 months month.

It's novel virus. one fortune teller; know immunity wanes starts wane. countries like China. Right think causes outweigh COVID-19 bit stretch without data support it. glad work too.  Yes, case. cousin's ex husband. got hospital admission, something unrelated. uncle, father said cousin, heart attack last week. death ex son-in-law mind, checked early, went home second, fatal, heart attack. 

That's Covid death, yet Covid, might died. Yeah, downvote guy asking evidence. Pfft. Reddit joke. idea Canada insistent keeping Meng America.

Canada work within treaty obligations important ally give China's thuggish hostage diplomacy. much paying buddy? happened alot ten times welded doors apartments closed too. America, testing one person time.

In America basically proactive testing all- least nationally coordinated fashion.

The pooled testing effective large groups presumed negative people. need government private businesses prompt asymptomatic people get tested. Sounds like time fill stadiums. There's hundreds millions survivors US alone, nearly billion survivors world... IDK many reddit users, I've run across bunch. Many even know SARS2 infection, immune system job correctly cleared it, like supposed do.

I survived it. Prior middle March, paying much attention intake nutrients immune system requires function correctly lot fronts fight on.

Taking virus seriously, began getting good healthy amounts nutrients immune system requires function properly every day.

Pretty soon afterwards (maybe couple weeks) got infection. various mild symptoms (like mild cough weeks, mildly sore throat half day). first symptom last symptom two months, many days period symptoms, never one symptom time. 

If I'd getting good healthy amounts nutrients immune system requires longer period time getting infected, expect would symptoms, shorter duration fewer symptoms, since body adjusts time improvements nutritional status.

Afterwards, felt better years, due taking nutrients immune system requires, couple things help promote ATP production.

When immune system actively fighting pathogen, mitochondria production ATP reduced. started taking malate aspartate forms magnesium, since malate aspartate involved ATP production. energy level higher years (compared people report months months low energy etc).

Would Truth Police Thought Police want censor that, contrary Doctrine, although consistent actual science paper, numerous heard sharknados one leading causes death days... ""shareholders"" hospital, business, hate almighty dollar drives everything, Chris Rock famously said "" world hates America worship money, go church, church ATM""

You make good points close comment nonsense like that. must know acting like make militant people militant. you‚Äôre really trying affect change maybe look getting little empathy people‚Äôs lives.

I understand someone could say one really able pin sort legitimate scientific study EXACT fatality rate. I'm saying super high, sure something literally CANNOT sure of. I'm sexist unlike place much emphasis politicians female male. Thanks playing. No, reported corona die tested. generally don‚Äôt test dead. America many countries aren't?

To fair kinda China's fault really shoulda locked flights/exports mysterious illness started although ONE SINGLE COUNTRY WORLD WOULD THIS.

Think underwear

Nobody know whether wash *everyday*...but really, ya know pictures cars result 135 Enough make jealous ok then. I've also tried KN95 Mask cloth mask still effective might country? author lazy look country? would pretty lame argument. locked hard everyone wears masks.

US, UK almost western countries ya going need look deaths compared previous years. 80s pretty fast... I've seen plenty total cars going 45 wrong spot far reported numbers go 291.000 actually English two networks main sources pandemic. wait what‚Äôs math Simply means might get immune partly immune infected coronaviruses beforehand. true, lockdown incredibly lax, testing next non existent Oddly enough issues tight twisty roads... Bigger pool. Dalian used pool 3, Qingdao going pool 8-10. Recent estimates also suggest 6,000 children could die every day preventable causes next six months result pandemic-related disruptions essential health nutrition services.

6000 children day six months: that's million children dead. COVID killed vastly fewer 6000 children *total*. Indeed, million people almost exactly total number people COVID killed. So, speaking sloppily, metric alone looks like cure might indeed bad disease.

But thing - COVID's deadliness age stratefied average age COVID death countries high higher average life expectancy. realize dicey territory hard quantify, mind death child starvation vastly worse tragedy death ailing 85 year old COVID. metric, willing entertain it, cure absolutely trounces disease horror.

And course, that's metric either. There's sorts downsides we've - suicides, substance abuse, poverty, list goes - could factor well, willing think seriously.

I think there's clear-cut, unarguable, yes/no answer. But...well, I've got lot not-very-kind words sort person could look numbers - look 6000 dead children day - say, without thought reluctance kind argument, great certitude, we're right thing. Yeah points shared inaccurate? someone engages discussion conspiracy doesn‚Äôt make irrational. Stop discussion. South Korea never lockdown.

Spikes happen system works. KCDC fucking amazing job. What's status Oxford vaccine US?

Also, I'd wager can't name single hospital offhand shut down. one.

I'd tempted wager many hospital closures 2020 compared past years. *could* do. collect information, they're using effectively fight virus. can't find original study came 50% number right now, I'm supposed sleeping.

But paper shows 35% unresolved symptoms 3 weeks negative test. really high percentage.

If really believe that? Feel free go first. Yup, including crazy antivaxxers make good points. still think important idea costs benefits lockdown, i.e., it'd cost, much still salvaged, is/wasn't necessary (for instance, banning outdoor exercise seems futile, shops alone seem major vectors transmission, etc.) benefits are. 

Unless opportunity introduce vaccination, better testing, better treatment shortly lockdown (i.e., cases artificially low) simply delaying cases seem like strong enough argument ‚Äî lockdowns get compliance lead better outcomes, bring 'em on. Wown u math u know u must right. K first guy Bro. Read beyond. 9th grade econ textbooks. could foot note, grateful taking virus seriously, internet socialization.

For well, really takes toll one's mental health while. I'm trying read knowledge based articles read books instead Reddit. really pessimistic garbage FP benefits one, try take Reddit grain salt much can. Otherwise I'll lose lol

Though seriously good taking stance. mindboggling many people childish can't *temporarily* follow minor inconveniences sake public health... Trump, American politics lack safety nets US general help, still reason go something temporarily... also still Thanksgiving Christmas year. I'm going staying home.

That's crazy lol, good choice! Still got toilet paper? ""More people hospital Covid lockdown March"" put fabric dryer, end lint lint trap. I've seen lint waste water washer well. seems clear washing fabric makes lose material. often wash cloth mask loses much fiber still effective?

(Please, hand-wavey arguments. real research determine this?) also confirm, last beans stolen. Oh no. Let's blame Gates **knowing** deaths coming. predicted impossible thus witch.

/s There's 1*C difference temperatures May October SH. boss makes fun covid company meetings, 250-person hq still full everyday thinks it‚Äôs bullshit. dad died earlier year need actually like job, otherwise like boss. man make furious. Yes I'm similar situation (Canadian expat living overseas) made decision stay, now. would never expect government spring flight home. I'm glad option hopping plane shit truly hits fan. Honestly, FDA joke. Shit gets approved shouldn‚Äôt time (eg: Vioxx), based testing standards FDA doesn‚Äôt care fix. 

At time, things don‚Äôt get approved isn‚Äôt giant pharmaceutical company behind ‚Äî even though plenty data shows safe effective. (I going open rabbit hole post - no, talking anything homeopathic traditional)

What really matters actual testing, plenty data released public. effective, symptoms intense say flu vaccine (ie: flu-like symptoms vaccine, particularly second shot), lasts day, maybe two, it‚Äôs over. 

Immunity seems last long longer actual virus.

Keep mind, ‚Äúfda testing‚Äù says virus safe effective. fact, plenty data shows cases, virus causes death permanent injury. 

You think live life safe, one day, screw up. point, spread whole family. 

Get vaccine.  size Belgium, local lockdown make sense. talk country like 200km long 100km wide. People cross country daily basis ew wtf? believe many gross people. 

We wash here, usually two loads week. I've made - dozens dozens - nbd grab clean one way door toss used laundry room way back later.  Archive link: Dying respiratory virus natural cause. that's 2/3 peak Florida summer, seems model far go basically nothing, albeit much warmer temperatures.

Juste 2 notes 

\- sure effect temperature virus already known. limiting peak Florida even. What's clear belgian weather time would gather garden restaurant terrace over. gather inside without real social distancing case make virus spread faster. 

\- big difference Belgium Florida. florida relatively low density heard jacksonville largest city (by area) US even one million inhabitant small house garden. Even stupid mask Karen, walk door car driveway, everything Drive-in (I've seen Drive-in Bank Florida, yes unbelievable seems), without close anybody. Belgium way urbanized, due small size country lot peole living ""rural"" area commute one large city (or Luxembourg). basically likely vicinity persons. harder keep social distance walking trough busy street, taking lift parking.  use correctly, no. healthcare workers tired, stressed, sleep deprived. Human error happens. gloat strong ones fear death can't even wear mask might remind danger.

Some can't even accept fact people dying would wrong.

Some argue old people ""lebensunw√ºrdiges Leben"" anyway ‚Ä¶

Yet consider rational sane. I‚Äôm saying ‚Äúabundant evidence‚Äù subject. LOL tools. Exactly deploy tools. Reuters story real facts it? Well fair. may completely right, I‚Äôm going go official numbers capable/willing admit actually going Umm, hell India 4th list. Makes sense Apologies meaningless words without action. 

Since brought apology, rectify it, forced assume apology own, empty. Numbers steady decline ever since White House took reporting. food delivery service  leaving home

Do think delivery drivers also worked home?

Yes, lockdowns work, time, demands literally everyone stay home make sense. think need break internet propaganda dude. Maybe talk walk outside? Ye, good points made. think way. read digest article research yourself? did, said accurate. It‚Äôs stretch, can‚Äôt deny it. again, comment wasn‚Äôt much argument anyway. Researchers discovered every 100 excess deaths directly attributed COVID-19, another 36 excess deaths‚Äîalso **likely** caused COVID-19, **but less obvious manner**. done decent would say, whole, alot deaths nordic countrys goverment publicly apologized fact hit hard care homes.

Yes things could done way better would say, fact steady curve moment summer.

If People like comparing countrys would say worse specteum hard hittong facts got really rough alot older folks. im denying alot family rough aswell.

But goverment open tells us danger virus still done okay whit everything open.

And ive seen People tell online crime want remind One ""best"" country world massiv deathtoll said quote ""its nothing afraid of"" Holy $#!+ single facet respect pandemic Trump done good job on. Holy shit. many old people murdered morphine even got chance treatment?

Cause like, shouldnt let fact Sweden commited Senicide go. fapping cures Covid! Also, seroprevalance studies discredit crazy notions something like 30%+ public infected. But, limited studies conducted corrupt bureaucracy responsible limiting testing (although, second one university, Tokyo, establishment).

Normally, seroprevalance studies overestimate seroprevalance due bad tests. So, Tokyo studies produce limited results strange.

Something like 1000 subjects, 1 2 positive. That's basis seroprevalance numbers seen. weird directions.

First, false positives 1 2?

Second, 1 2 people positive, sample size going able give precise answer seroprevalance. Yup, lockdowns work - long followed, people actually want follow them. 

This cuts ways: half-ass them, present ""new normal"" assume fix everything locking even harder six months. Thanks ur reply. kind get right now. Japanese social less kind airborne transmit disease spread slower jp. Go New Zealand!!! movie it? remember scene all. sounds horrible, probably subconsciously blocked memory. Strap folks (but don‚Äôt hoard toilet paper please) know started: Republican machine working alt right conspiracy groups internet. decades making general distrust Science authority figures experts. ridiculous ""scientists fake reports make look like climate change real they'll get money""... know, like rich graduate students public universities driving around Ferraris whatnot..... Thisnis great cause covid doesnt work holidays No. Society would win achieve high rate vaccination quickly possible. 

Society pay economic effects restrictions (even ‚Äúminor‚Äù restrictions cost huge amounts aggregate), well cost cases end chronic symptoms organ damage. importantly, end thousands infected knocking door local hospital time. However, government seems endorse Trump, least nothing stop him. makes system accountable. also much smaller issue, maybe dont take mask, pick candle, sniff it, put back. seems like effective way positive person spread it.  Ah shit right tool call China daddy Herd immunity may possible, vaccines might effective.

Eradication might difficult, long term containment completely possible.

I think Anglo-Americans comfortable idea emergency, government active aggressive normal. think Europe afraid like idea government taking power emergency. So, might seem impossible Germany contain virus maintaining normal life. But, might necessary emergency conditions, contain virus, move on. Yes show prepared Americans future 2 bitterly decided camps survivors. Thanks Greetings Japan.

Again, simply incorrect. Overdose absolutely listed death certificates alcohol related deaths. sounds like watch way many criminal TV shows.

It sounds like trying make shit go along absolutely idea talking about. quite obvious don't. literally databases death certificates US researchers delve look trends deaths. know alcohol related deaths increase decrease. know opioid crisis first place. think medical examiners lazy run routine toxicology screens ridiculous. cause death heart failure, etc..

Learn read motherfucker. aware 100% wore masks yes, would crazy considering many protesters are.

Then also know wearing mask prevents transmitting breathing. prevent catching COVID transmitting touch. one COVID positive person crowd wearing mask, none might well be. virus live certain surfaces multiple days, sure shit spread like wildfire crowd full people social distancing. Especially they're shoulder shoulder screaming top theyre effective people use them. nothing type situation.

Depends mean ""effective"". CDC disagrees you, say everyone wear masks prevent transmission. CDC director Robert Redfield said masks would effective significantly reducing COVID transmissions everyone wore interesting opinion! Got sources back up?

[In one study still undergoing peer review, researchers analyzing cell phone location data found people cities rocked protests likely stay home, perhaps due curfews enacted amid protests, or‚Äîespecially places police violently cracked demonstrators‚Äîfear getting caught mayhem. ‚ÄúEven increase number cases among protesters themselves, one extent, non-protesting population engaging greater social distancing, going outside house much did‚Ä¶that counteracts increase,‚Äù says Dhaval Dave, professor economics Bentley University co-author bad Republicans taking seriously shut down.

Remember typed this? point responded to. said Republicans taking seriously. They're ones encouraging mass gatherings summer. Democrats way knowing time encouraging protests (debatable whether not) lead increased transmissions. Trump responsible 25% global covid deaths even though 4% global population. Faaaaaaaaaailure.

Many, many studies looked this, never found it.

Burden proof show drives transmission since theory outside accepted science. schools currently? distancing schools using masks something? low numbers medium mask usage (and cluster breaking mentioned above) Poland schools reopened turned complete disaster... Yeah, that's hand-washing comes touch potentially contaminated stuff. also say informed correct information may also subject ‚Äúbeing killed‚Äù simply everything right got anyway way one mistake something simple forgetting touch mouth, example.

Hmm, kinda since Trump one really saying ""lockdown work"". 

Second, googled it. Practically nobody saying lockdown work. Only... Trump, admin. Huh. hiring right people enforce rules? Big beefy guys non-lethal weapons able it. Celsius  found 249,167 total excess deaths 1,021 counties, 183,686 deaths directly assigned COVID-19 death certificates, another 65,481 excess deaths officially assigned COVID-19. means 26 percent excess deaths directly attributed COVID-19‚Äîor viewed another way, actual excess deaths 36 percent higher number officially attributed COVID-19. seem recovered pretty well. Dangerous virus, nearly dangerous 99% people making be. still shouldn‚Äôt neglect risk population though.

I hope Smash Mouth thinks worth ...  one wants that, quit lying partisan piece shit. think really understand paper's saying. looked excess deaths due Covid-19, total increase mortality due virus. findings undereporting figure, higher income inequality given community, greater undereporting

Nobody trying artificially 'inflate' numbers. We're trying get grips actual impact disease. Agreed. I'm saying lockdowns mask fine months. Ridiculous basically kills less 1% yet everyone supposed social distance, lose jobs entire years this! I'm personally fed this. Yes, I'm selfish. seen fiance year this.

Wrong, read article, infections *begin* hospital. what's article about? Yes, clear China's covering outbreak well covered outbreaks :P

Thanks  need immunity. There's countries already open things correctly lower infections.  hospitals NYC overwhelmed completely, mismanaged. hospitals poorer neighborhoods got overwhelmed that's people getting virus people got severe infections. Many hospitals richer neighborhoods fine, bureaucracy made difficult transfer patients timely manner. 

If managed better gotten patients transferred receive better care, lot deaths could avoided. said poorer hospitals would one nurse twenty patients, recommended one nurse every five. patients nurse had, likely patient die. comes money sadly. (and still are) lot likely live. There's great episode NYT's daily podcast this. stupid field hospital NYC end helping anyone dumb bureaucracy doctor's playing candy crush phones patients coming in, meanwhile hospitals overwhelmed. - need close sodding cafe!! China well. don‚Äôt know people think virus can‚Äôt contained.  New Zealand got latest wave (the one Trump gloated about) partial lockdown one city start lockdown rest wave, virus killed testing contact tracing. probably truth this. working Houston surge 6 weeks Covid patients ICU. It‚Äôs gone back normal patients. day busy two crashing (non-Covid) thought occurred me: people surge didn‚Äôt beds available? Surely sick people getting care. BLM protests allowed posts like aren‚Äôt made those? people edge cooped months. find snapping people more. Call health care provider. allowed drink alcohol home.

So far measures end start November, knows. 16 times would cost handled correctly. Stop nitpicking, BLM protests allowed, yet Armenian protests celebrations like not? Social distancing isn‚Äôt followed these.

Either ban everything allow everything, stop picking choosing.  resist change. won‚Äôt stop change. changed this. fortunately evolved adaptable. others. reopened bars month ago, many closed anyway since reclassifieds restaurants. 25th went officially 100% capacity, nobody following rules anyway.  dont think going see much change honestly. mean elderly middle-aged folks leaving states catch 'rona die? Basically. New pandemic happens tomorrow, we'll see exact response Yup. That‚Äôs means. Oops, correct. That‚Äôs way it. It‚Äôs brainier. I've seeing folks reddit FB last days claiming exact opposite - CDC numbers prove zero excess deaths year, pandemic fake. 

Obviously people wrong, twisting facts support wish true. people need told still, good source. doesn‚Äôt say young adults suffering strokes. isn‚Äôt hard. article absolute trash wow life long native would concur. taking middle road ‚Äî lose weight slowly? It‚Äôs really better way stick anyway. took 15 months, went BMI 37 &lt;25 time. 6+ months Covid. Yeah exactly. Like, I‚Äôve always known news articles written get many clicks possible that‚Äôs business model, media coverage covid managed disappoint even thought possible. zero consequences ridiculously awful quality covid new coverage. They‚Äôll keeping selling fear, despair, outrage porn long people willing click it. might minority here, 40 million seems like might high me. That's like 1/8 country, anecdotally, would knowing several people coronavirus symptoms, lot us not. Plus, think testing, ratio actual vs. confirmed cases improving. personal guess around 20-30 million Americans. I'm told could somehow lead fewer infections... definitely wear masks public spaces like stores. Even gym ! hard Fauci admitted directly interview back like April ""hip"" online talk show thing. youtube. I'm lazy dig but, take word it, made clear saving stockpile, lack information efficacy masks. Nope.

Put strawman away. Would still ‚Äùacceptable‚Äù relative? seems like always easy downplay long surroundings aren‚Äôt affected. be. government overreach conspiracy theorists happy free market(in case Disney) determining virus problem right? don‚Äôt see that. Lol

Of course closed would ideal, don‚Äôt live ideal world unfortunately. Horrifying infections rising certain areas shut areas it'll spread everywhere again. virus spreads quickly easily. can't sit months hoping it'll stop. stop infection spread quickly, figure what's causing them, fix issue. 

How else handled? There's infections rising certain areas anything let spread? usually leave 100 ft anyone outside. Thats fair enough.

I assumed headline May 27th highest May make sense would lower May 1st. Proves point guess. man literally says young adults. world think discussing people 30-40s young adults......you truly don‚Äôt think referencing young adults, 15 years younger considered actual adults? would two excerpts hospital connected. 

You focusing syntax word with/without. Meanwhile uses word young adults, references average lengths time, gives average age range covid-patients. truly believe young adults 30-50 years old......

The evidence coming place. References young adults, word without entire article person worked meaningless lmao. Gtfo  seat belts, especially early on, even today. would kids automatically buckling bugging parent so. actually are, Cops find you‚Äôre probably going get fined. Don‚Äôt even get started happened Facundo Castro least 91 people. it‚Äôs low, people opening economy wearing masks? Yes, take imported cases, mistakes made.

Specifically, looking CT scanner properly sanitized use.

Read one article. Yep successfuly handling Covid would protect better army. every motivation screw up.

Mostly stress sleep deprivation.

Japan's policy obviously best world, low death rate far disastrous situation. speed we're heading straight Covid hell. I've since January. shame see three months lockdown quickly forgotten. Let's hope things slow down. ""literalist interpretation"" yes, words ""what person actually said.""

Someone ""supposedly edited"" back day trained stick that. understand journalistic standards shifted since then; perhaps source confusion.

As interpretation subjective view inaccurate, already explained that. explanation remains unclear you, suggest courses logic might benefit you. well. Holy crap votes. literally repeating scientists world said/are saying (and saying YEARS, COVID), people can't handle it. least honest right?....  1% people die we‚Äôre undercounting deaths significant amount. 40 million people infected seems totally plausible one thing disagree policies, totally agree, law place frankly irritating follow see others ignore like apply them. like law, damn fault electing people.

But frankly, requiring indoor masks see cumbersome I'll suck up. bowling league started recently people followed rules league/alley wore masks, others said f-it wear mask.

I go grocery shopping week 82 year old pops would prefer catch it, verdict may still efficacy masks, can't hurt... rules rules. tried arming sister works restaurant

I think big part it. People necessarily exposed every day, would much rather believe virus contagious harmful. go work every day trying visualize potential viral droplet air keep track every inch surface multiple customers touched hand lunch etc.. much person handle. 
The obvious solution problem like go there! system quite fucked, workers like sister *have* go every day. 
 
So would rather rationalize daily routine something existentially worry about, less stressed. That's active incentive want believe virus bad. That's extremely sad, frankly understandable.

The real sin people intentionally downplaying virus 1) **greed** 2) **inability leader take responsibility**; - know, things people permit stop good person. 
 
So business leaders tried downplay virus hurts profits. politicians downplayed virus want look bad constituents die. Fuck people, real. Yup.

Nope, missed zero. 0.06% ""Yay, one month rona gets another chance kill me!"" explicitly says 30s 40s age range people covid. explicitly says 15 years younger age range refers stroke patients without covid. trolling point. contagious means lives lost obesity worth less? would following rules help us get faster? need immunity pandemic end. cognizant dry eye issue get done. Try choline supplements Alpha-GPC. Also, try vasodilators - simplest safest one L-Citrulline.

Surgical masks don‚Äôt problem they‚Äôre slightly bigger. clearly willfully misinterpreting article. cannot make point clearer. Table three place death. Table 5 Excess deaths x84 listed. give statistic, silly. Abbott already terribly reliable COVID test yet getting special clearance antigen test? I‚Äôm really happy New Zealand commend courageous leader. However bit:

‚ÄúCertainly New Zealand advantageous position because‚Äù ***it‚Äôs island way far South Pacific***. 

For countries bordering others, especially *open* borders ‚Äî less straightforward. breaking news: NZ small ISLAND somewhere under!! closer 7 million dad passed away thing. broke hip, threw clot, caused massive heart attack. Cause death listed old age.  90's. Thanks engaging.

I agree majority yet, support falling across board trend clear. Local governments industry sectors furious continued closures suing protesting cases. person anti-lockdown protests also common across Europe, even countries early lockdowns originally. I‚Äôm also skeptical polls lockdowns, people say think right knowing full well won‚Äôt follow rules themselves. Currently UK 18% people coronavirus symptoms following self isolation orders, basic thing test trace system work.

Of course technological reason test tracing system can‚Äôt work, used great expense world, yet none stopped second wave. You‚Äôd think simple would one example working right? Governments pouring billions it‚Äôs desired effect. response is: try harder. It‚Äôs like saying one took drugs wouldn‚Äôt drug overdoses. one special case doesn‚Äôt make realistic option countries, matter much you‚Äôd like be. 

I‚Äôm glad South Korea‚Äôs economy strong, probably thanks lockdowns, that‚Äôs case countries contained it. example New Zealand‚Äôs GDP shrunk 12% last quarter, Thailand‚Äôs 13 % YoY Q2. It‚Äôs hardly easy ride.

Why haven‚Äôt thrown towel enforcing economic restrictions charities said put millions children globally back poverty, cause huge collateral public health educational damage next generation? see easy would someone mad that? don‚Äôt think look beyond 1%. Like see go ‚Äúoh that‚Äôs low!‚Äù see Canada. people wearing masks ignoring social distancing, pandemic going away.

So solution then? course one sub cares Sturgis hysteria care even then

they say God's something like 10% us got infected, would ton dead already do. Fortunately unfortunately. doubt New Zealand good position. Perhaps now. might actually postponing inevitable. stop virus countries successful first phase generally hit most.

Who's say economy better opened everything right now, let people already retirement years die? Surely support them, we'd lower taxes economy would gain it?

‚Äú*After first peak early spring, US death rates COVID-19 causes remained higher even countries high COVID-19 mortality,‚Äù Bilinski Emanuel conclude. ‚ÄúThis may result several factors, including weak public health infrastructure decentralized, inconsistent US response pandemic.*‚Äù

‚Äú*In yet another article, team psychiatrists highlights every single extra death creates radius devastation. ‚ÄúEach COVID-19 death leaves estimated 9 family members bereaved,‚Äù psychiatrists write. ‚Äúprojects estimated 2 million bereaved individuals US,‚Äù given 225,000 extra deaths far. ‚ÄúThus, effect COVID-19 deaths mental health profound*.‚Äù

Go cry states started messing death counts cdc numbers indicates nationally, count 50%. states counting 100%, ny dominates statistics point ny alone brought national count 100% 50%. so, yes, likely actual death count well Fair enough. sure why, thought said ""concerted"" effort, implying everyone trying report. mistake. Yes, following isolation guidelines, even counting properly! still wear mask. immunity lasts months! would sacrificing people get herd immunity time vaccine starts rolling through.

I also doubt death toll idiotic idea temporary herd immunity would low Michigan. true, trying get people focus airborne transmission post surface transmission like telling people heart disease bigger problem COVID. There's nothing technically false statement, distraction discussion. vectors needs taken consideration, one other. AMOUNT consideration gets vary based risk level, trying push people focus away one transmission method helping.  Yeah used enjoy visiting basically everything covid compatible.

Losing cruise lines alone massive shops bars.  think coming back time soon. Good luck? even know say buddy always hear ""tax spend liberals"", never spend spend ""Conservatives"". news report link? Nah you‚Äôre one. people brains they‚Äôre trying dupe psy op obvious vote brigading shit aren‚Äôt falling this. Fuck coaches dont even bother wear masks correctly sidelines, really fuck ones say stupid shit. 

Fucking despicable. Stable? max testing capacity based whose showing symptoms willing get tested. keep counting jobs USA, instead sourcing China. known accurate reporting real numbers. Antibodies don‚Äôt wane zero, least common cold coronaviruses. general specific immune response virus wane level permits reinfection even subsequent disease less severe. really viruses can‚Äôt reinfected think it. correct. pandemics since beginning humanity. They‚Äôre horrible stressful live through, always end. Absolutely trust. lied grand scale.

BUT, approve lies. want government shut everything get away with. want scare people. want destabilize whole economy. 

Why? tripled net worth stock market everyone panicking. corona blessing best thing ever happened life, wish leaders would give another round complete lockdown, boost death stats much possible. Lie stats please, scare dumb money rake again.

\* Obviously rub people wrong way, apologize. fact would hope people appreciate someone honest once. whole thing one greatest transfer wealth workers wealthy. profited it, can. make sense lol fans breaking rules sec schools ha okay I‚Äôm done obviously can‚Äôt open eyes Yes one you‚Äôre going falling ‚ÄúComrade‚Äù politicians allowing positive results released DC Health contact tracing. one uncivil? lasting immunity human coronaviruses ie cold causing ones. reason assume immunity novel coronavirus? large cities lean Democrat. People live cities likely get infected. matter. life life, need die. let's say oh issues....nothing worry about, keep pretending life back normal Issue hospitalisations track deaths, cases. Since developed over-the-counter, MD, treatments covid, 'positive tests' correlate hospitalisations. really 

Yes, first wave almost certainly magnitude higher cases (could 20x - 40x higher), still explain positive tests longer track well hospitalisations/deaths. i.e using hospitalitizations metric, (or least % positivity) rather headline grabbing ""cases rise x%""

Using figures article (est 600m infections 2 million deaths), one lowest IFRs to-date. 3-5x lower reported. ""The Swedes abunch idiots, pay attention success."" man's obligation stick boneration woman's separation, sort penetration increase population younger generation.

Pslams 4:9 CEASE INVESTIGATIONS Children 2 5 times cells adults better fighting novel viral infections. Adults rely immunity wanes age. virus particularly cytopathic, immune response causes issues people go hill 10 days. proper TH1 immune response healthy innate immune response get particularly sick. immune weaknesses develop inappropriate TH2 response trouble moment start producing IgG antibodies bind virus infected cells trigger TH2 inflammatory response designed fighting bacterial infections. That's antibody production suppressed TH1 antiviral immune pathway. actually want infected cell cleared killer cells prior IgG production. Good job, that's keep up, great course cases severely underreported. positivity rate 30 %. 20 % two weeks ago. takey days infected person get tested another 1-2 days know results. Basically, new cases today reflect situation 1-2 weeks ago. yet another article, team psychiatrists highlights every single extra death creates radius devastation. ‚ÄúEach COVID-19 death leaves estimated 9 family members bereaved,‚Äù psychiatrists write. ‚Äúprojects estimated 2 million bereaved individuals US,‚Äù given 225,000 extra deaths far. ‚ÄúThus, effect COVID-19 deaths mental health profound.‚Äù ""if doctors smart, millions them?""

These guys hypocrites. Indiana dumpster fire past week, cold weather incoming proof impossible. (On able sue transmission) Unfortunately already precedent devloped.

It would probably like meat packing plants plant states could possibly caught plant really sad (the sick individual) caught elsewhere. Although think senate insurance policy would pay medical expenses, sick time, even life insurance death occur - unlike meat packing plants denied reasons. Sweden show us foolish being. could sworn came support masks listen science.

Anyways, remember everyone freaking late February sick. everybody. elite making money thanks tax cuts, mainly middle class poor foot bill. No, do. predictable transparent dishonesty. refusal stay subject running plan. boring dishonest. speaking anymore.

Its kind like speed limit. Sure, changed universal 6mph, less people would die. realistic expectation everyone cautious? dad died march. really first started Washington got hit pretty bad early on. 55 heart attack odd. Looking back think covid cant certain since cremated. Based important things seems decided trying kill mask mandate number one priority right now. can't believe it. worst case scenario masks work know do.

Edit : Here's [analysis piece going nuances forecasts. emphasizes investment / trade confidence, whichever countries better control pandemic win sooner.  Right, that's opinion moment looking current data; Sweden ~1-2 death day covid couple months worldometer, seems close population immunity realistically get. think portion extra 90K deaths caused lockdown it'll take long time confirm many actually are. immunity last/we covid spike winter think bets off, I'm really hoping happen. Never let good crises go waste Point Australia.

Every state either hit zero effectively zero except Victoria rejoining us soon. 

Also point total number deaths static whole nation 102 late May late June jumped almost 900 finally slowing down.

This almost due one breach one quarantine facility. whole state Victoria still lockdown wrestle peak 700 new cases day managed get 10-15/day. They're still closed, though it.

So that's effect life business cases versus outbreak.

Another post, another refusal post link. correct. This, potentially gives leverage world stage. Russia's economy still hurting heavy sanctions following annexation Crimea attempts turn Ukraine puppet state.

Being first get vaccine serves two purposes: 1) gets economy advantageous position restart everyone else, 2) used bargaining chip countries generate goodwill given them. worry big pharma would rather people rely miracle drug **whatever vaccine able pull out**.

This sounds close anti-vax rhetoric. vaccine absolutely crucial ending pandemic regardless anything else. I'm saying healthy improve chances course. fits category populations experience severe covalent whereas others seem get away without much effects?

 vaccines coming. still figuring Spanish flu we'll figuring one next hundred years so. Rapid strides made. I'm pretty sure we'll vaccine next year. ""Russia *reports*"" I'm guessing deaths go ""normal"" curve deaths certain period. they're directly indirectly connected pandemic. downscaling normal healthcare also influences this. way keep politics discussion speak city man. followed good 2 months least, started legally relaxing it: 40 cases city 300.000 2 months. town still 0 cases, provinces like La Pampa kept low numbers.

A lockdown followed makes sense. 200 days shit rules change within week drives anyone mad. Yup. friend told friend saying hospital tried give $1,000 say mom died COVID instead cancer.

Two weeks ago wife sore throat/cough, felt fine. wanted us get tested precautionary. call number testing site asked exposed someone it, showing symptoms. said told get tested. 

They tested wife symptoms fever. Thankfully covid. Pretty dumb testing hard get around here. sorry man, I‚Äôve two close friends lose family members Covid use precise argument talking people tin foil hats.

Anyway, whenever see figures, indeed death rates across eastern Asia, makes wonder pre-existing immunity (maybe covid19, coronavirus). point wonder much pay that. So, closer 300,000... incomplete record reviews US. would stop people rioting protesting law enforcement wearing masks... how, exactly?

Take someone UK, matter _why_ people flaunting COVID restrictions, media starts playing justified nobody's going keep staying inside. yes, unlikely. Provided also careful touch face wash hands, really something concerned about. Yes, clearly superior governance Samoa, Tonga, Marshall Islands, Kiribati, Micronesia, Nauru, Palau, Vanuatu, Micronesia, Solomon Islands, also explains successful handling pandemic.

People lost ability think critically. Combine fact high level scientific research become nearly unintelligible people field science, recipe disaster. Case point, back March research paper touted conspiracy theorists downplayed severity disease.

Like sad pregnancy autism example higher thread, you‚Äôd read know garbage.....but people bother confirms want hear. That's issue though. issue really difficult tell tone written word. people actually serious. aren't. condition confused people, tool, /s used. whistleblower. disappeared.

I'd link sources easy find know read anyway, since seem determined spit conspiracy theory bottom despite evidence contrary.

I know, focused hating China maybe try come seemingly reasonable explanation contradict facts, giving reasons people half brain completely dismiss you.

Oh, way, China world factory, tend better customers buy products. saying'. three contributing factors. drugs themselves, helping, guy finding another way hospital either asking someone else even walking. 

It‚Äôs cut dry blame placed one thing. That‚Äôs point. would even say ridiculous thing? gave evidence back up, even inkling statement could based reality. feel like spewing nonsense morning? I'm sorry loss. can't imagine pissed would someone called hoax face losing sister. Fuck people.   B-b-b-but it‚Äôs demarcate hoax! death count isn‚Äôt actually high, die diseases causes! Young people can‚Äôt actually die it, it‚Äôs like flu! ""a thing"" fact hospitals got 13k covid patient gotten plain pnemonia patient also got 39k someone went ventilator. really surprised healthcare industry money? realize drugs doctor prescribes he's getting kickback right? realize given prescriptions instead told lose weight take Vitamin there's money made losing weight taking $5 supplement right? like specify CCP. Otherwise regular Chinese folks similar regular folks everywhere. Shit, times 1,000 they‚Äôre *still* lot better countries also saw 72.5% testing positivity rate yesterday It‚Äôs not. DeSantis fired lady created numbers portal wouldn‚Äôt fudge numbers reopening state. back June/July. current Florida resident, trust Florida numbers. opinion places like New Zealand Taiwan South Korea shut completely immediately, aggressively employed contact tracing, utterly decimated virus? US thing? option mind keep everything open let virus burn population? Also herd immunity basically requires milllions die order achieve it, REALLY GOOD IDEA MAN China capitalist though. entire ideology party wise money.

Edit: there‚Äôll never another Cold War China forefront. USSR wanted spread it‚Äôs ideology, China wants make money everyone. agree completely. think actually making majority disparity, probably move needle significant enough amount ignored. know case beginning well. But, increase heart attacks, respiratory failure, strokes, fairly obvious. whole situation sucks, discrepancies loud deniers use argue fake exaggerated, blah blah. Annoying, people want prove desires, reality. half US states seeing increase new Covid-19 cases, five states -- Montana, New Mexico, North Carolina, Tennessee Vermont -- reporting jump 50% one Health experts warned weekend US could surge coronavirus cases deaths coming months, adding 7.7 million cases 214,764 deaths record. Self driving cars vaccine making ridiculous straw-man argument? Nobody hates idea going back normal. People hate idea deplorables failing cooperate causing longer pandemic ever necessary. hate idea going back normal, ridiculous thing say. Chinabot. fucking idea OPS comment's downvoted. What's hard understand folks? China testing entire cities = good. China informing world extent characteristics virus illness = bad. Can't west look things objectively anymore? COVID experts quiet like BLM protests. ‚Äúinfect‚Äù us. Fixed ya people needed masks. Every manufactured mask available gone groups people general population told wear homemade face coverings supply chain caught up. Versus general population, worse outcomes. know compare numbers think made point here? I'd agree close bars first, even indoor dining. gyms still seen cases despite people say. 47 cases spin classes Hamilton Whataboutism. Democracy != Muh Freedoms
Though definitely seems strong correlation Yes china, whether believe irrelevant you. like chinese would travel country anyways.  Actually everyone proper N95s I‚Äôd way happier things opening! problem one‚Äôs gonna right now. Way judge people whose mental health affected current situation. first test usually establish base line -- long survive ideal conditions lab. simulate life like situations measure impacts different factors. maybe even come sort field study (unlikely field studies case lol).  


Good science starts foundation basic levels best understand elements question. case, basically determined what's absolute longest virus remain viable surface. information, actually measure impacts different conditions viability using control. also gives ""an absolute longest"" amount time might useful situations extra precautions needed potential exposures. Dangerous logic. Judge risk catching Covid based medical evidence, notion bad feel like seeing someone's face. *only* ""good"" thing bring end Trump administration.  many things guy go prison this. Deaths pretty much like like point Aus - 902 flu deaths 2019, 898 Covid deaths.

No deaths flu year minimal infections.

I know Victoria though death toll car road accidents also dropped. problem get high death numbers despite lot people taking precautions. Imagine number actually let run course. 

The vaccine coming take enough people vaccinated slow spread. Possibly 2022 (according WHO).

Is society able remain vigilant another year?

That's hard lock serious contact tracing afterwards look necessary... prevent lot people dying also economy. like attitude  Cultural backgrounds excuse. See New Zealand, example, closer European countries Korea. NZ also closer UK rest Europe. However, neither UK European countries even close NZ. It‚Äôs government‚Äôs fault mess things time second wave. Ya well say less 200,000 must true mean one replied already, LOL.

What mental midget. 

**When serologic test PCR test results come back positive ask questions...**

üì∑

...''From coronavirus positive?'' thousands viruses bodies. let make fun mock you. ''You tested positive coronavirus'' ''OK, coronavirus exactly?'' 

Hcov-229 E? 

Hcov-OC43? 

Hcov-NL63? 

Hcov-HKU1? 

Sars-cov? 

Mers-cov? 

Sars-cov-2?

More: named crown-like spikes surface. four main sub-groupings coronaviruses, known alpha, beta, gamma, delta.

Human coronaviruses first identified mid-1960s. seven coronaviruses infect people are:

Common human coronaviruses

229E (alpha coronavirus)

NL63 (alpha coronavirus)

OC43 (beta coronavirus)

HKU1 (beta coronavirus)

Other human coronaviruses

MERS-CoV (the beta coronavirus causes Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, MERS)

SARS-CoV (the beta coronavirus causes severe acute respiratory syndrome, SARS)

SARS-CoV-2 (the novel coronavirus causes coronavirus disease 2019, COVID-19)

Also ask many times spin samples: 
 

France concerned scientists say 25.

45 spins get fragments overamplified results lead ""positive"" result.

There 7 types coronaviruses human body. PCR detects one those. first four common colds get lifetime. may rarely hear TV someone positive Covid-19 Sars-cov-2 (even say that, may lying, since lot officials say virus never isolated, even though claim has. Plus, say, mutates). say always, generically, positive coronavirus.

Also ask one 84000 strains/mutations [WHO says mutations 84000 CDC regarding virus isolation:

It seems isolated months Smoking Gun: coronavirus? CDC says isn‚Äôt available. Oct8 Jon Rappoport

‚ÄúSince quantified virus isolates 2019-nCoV currently available, assays \[diagnostic tests\] designed detection 2019-nCoV RNA tested characterized stocks vitro transcribed full length RNA‚Ä¶‚Äù

The key phrase is: ‚ÄúSince quantified virus isolates 2019-nCoV currently available‚Ä¶‚Äù

Every object exists quantified, say, measured. use term ‚Äúquantified‚Äù phrase means: CDC measurable amount virus, unavailable.

THE CDC VIRUS.

A tip-off use word ‚Äòisolates.‚Äù means ISOLATED VIRUS AVAILABLE.

Another way put it: ONE ISOLATED SPECIMEN COVID-19 VIRUS. ONE ISOLATED COVID-19 VIRUS. THEREFORE, ONE PROVED EXISTS.

As enough revelation shock world, CDC goes say presenting diagnostic PCR test detect virus-that-hasn‚Äôt-been-isolated‚Ä¶and test looking RNA PRESUMED come virus hasn‚Äôt proved exist.

And using test, CDC every public health agency world counting COVID cases deaths‚Ä¶and governments instituted lockdowns economic devastation using case death numbers justification. people believe ‚Äúyou virus available,‚Äù virus except buried within material hasn‚Äôt extracted purified isolated, people believe moon made green cheese.

This like saying. ‚ÄúWe 20 trillion dollars, contained somewhere myriad accounts, don‚Äôt know where.‚Äù don‚Äôt know where, don‚Äôt know money.

Someone told yesterday: Covid, asymptomatic carriers viral agent called ''healthy carriers'', covid became ''infected''. regime vocabulary describes perfectly terrorism behind criminal operation. like, fuck. youre killing people stupidity!

Some rebound failed arguments right cases herd immunity, too.

Seriously?!?!?

Either:

1. That's believed along, lying.
2. morally incapable comprehending knee-jerk argument last resort rather millions die flat admit whole ""hoax"" argument mistaken. Sweden tried let experts decide.

Fixed. talking new cases recorded last days, confirmed covid test No, happened due peoples governments responses Covid. second lockdown disaster, hope stupid lmao based Viet. Let phrase different way. Canada called US today like let‚Äôs open border. think US response be? Quick Search found official Info mid february end march excluding asymptomatic cases. Situation atm clear me. Try solve later It¬¥s flu! sorry loss.

This weekend heard crazy tragic story different angle home town.

A boy died, brother aparently found bed next morning.

A days later facebook post claiming died school bus wearing mask. true. mortician got angry explained true, die bus wearing mask (of course, can#t go actual details, felt say something).

And top that, dermatologist (so someone probably wear doctor title expert viruses, pandemics anythning relevant matter hand) also anti-mask train cited case example dangers masks.

Completely made bullshit unrelated tragedy gets used argument anti-maskers Corona-hoaxers.

People's loss personal tragedies gets belittled anti-maskers corona hoaxers, utterly misrepresented ammunition fight reality (of course, they'd call ""fight truth""). read comment posting? New articles couple weeks ago saying guidelines even strict now.

Lol, comment history explains all.

You live r/coronavirusjapan r/ japan mindlessly shilling japanese.  recommend 'The Underground History American Education' John Taylor Gatto. 

The system never meant teach critical thinking, past decades declined even more. why? every country opened economic windows summer allowed senseless travelling. 

it like boomerang comes back hits head. Even Alzheimer disease spikes along COVID. respiratory, pneumonia, Heart disease, Alzheimer surprises me. really sad probably psychological explanation behaviour.

I obviously know entire situation working restaurant suppose able find work like desk job work home.

She probably needs income really choice? seams like rationalisation situation in.

Don't angry her, angry government letting pandemic get control help people get by. moment world gallops next big infection wave. Yea, following reddit China, followed John Hopkins ArcGIS came America, watched worldometers throughout summer. 

I‚Äôve used excess deaths multiple arguments effective point, point can‚Äôt care anymore. wave washed us many drown. flattened curb avoid overloading hospitals. Wasn‚Äôt goal?  practice reporting asymptomatic cases

Is true confirmed China source? isn't. count every death suspicion covid covid death. Someone positive gets run car, covid death...

So Belgium statistical fluke. since beginning. News 11 talking people believe COVID hoax propagated liberals, suffocation mask usage greater danger contracting COVID.

""Making sense"" criterion decision-making. could anecdotal. I've seen minimum wage go get according raise boss, small business him. job owed raise anyway kinda rolled together.

So dunno, raising minimum wage specifically helped me. one person know good whole. rly? Would really matter boarders reopened? I'd assume would take months import usual strains international travel back 2019 levels. really frustrating boss who's really nice guy pretty reasonable person thinks deaths hoax believes hospitals paid extra money whenever get covid cases claiming people come covid cases even they're somebody dies say car accident covid positive considered covid death... hate become world evidence based science put question, compared idiot spouting babble evidence science involved immediately trusted.

sounds lot like, thing called? religion.  That's really good! Test pooling. America since like August. People don‚Äôt know though that‚Äôs people getting testing done quickly. Lack evidence (positive tests) evidence absence. abundant evidence disease gone. lack positive tests. Ah well useless asthma patients arnt allowed get inhaled shit. needle fear told nasal stuff due asthma xD. deleted wrong comments, MUST aiming one it. Pretty sure put test NYC came photographs needed bodies peak.

They still surrounding hospitals harassing staff corroborating global hoax.

Imagine conspiracies depend cooperation every single employed certified medical professional.

Even assuming could stay quiet, imagine cause would need righteous every single one would agree take graves, lest public know, I'd even sympathetic. LOL wow, women predictable, fragile. Fair point hypocrisy, US lying mean bad China's likely lying well. think really trust Russia numbers. 


Look Health care worker's memory list, 733 names. Compare countries e.g. Amnesty. Russia's numbers correct extremely high ratio health care workers fatalities compared e.g. early hard hit Italy. excess deaths. July Russia reported less 6k Covid deaths, reported excess deaths 


The Economist list (Apr 1st-Jul 31st) 13946 Covid-19 deaths 83358 excess deaths. Six times excess deaths Covid-19 deaths. seven day average deaths yesterday 177 compared peak 178 June. deaths already reached spring's peak, cases deaths. 
 22722 Covid-19 deaths could well 6 times high. 136322 per capita 940 deaths per million.  capita it‚Äôs even close though.

Russia could well worse even Belgium already. Belgium matches covid-19 deaths excess deaths. 


As comparing death peak vs spring, Belgium 6% spring peak. (7 day average 18 vs 286). Organized care people cares well, Chile even quarantine people go out, work, walk dog, ride bikes, chill park... stay home fucking Chileans, host parties night, annoying illegal.

I hate compatriots. Jesus fucking christ FUCKING USELESS PRICKS. Yeah wonder whether really worth now. clearly pick infected people *before* test them, probably spend money elsewhere. pretty sure Argentina swimming money right now. That's said. anti lockdowns live country high risk people empowered minimize risks rest us live almost normally, difference masks can't travel home country foreseeable future can't get shit together. also empathic people vying extra time loved ones, government refuses make easy rest get already depends mean *destroy*, wait saying lockdowns negative impact economy?

Or Sweden similar negative impact rest Nordics? asshole uncle yelled street outside house day telling even bad flu. Hey hey hey, also assholes maniacs like whipped 140mph highway cause fun would never drive way risk hitting someone getting pulled over. Almost like plan spread across whole counrty slowing enough stop hospitals overwhelmed. Bumping huge numbers sick elderly ... non tax payers.... Umm... Trump start saying big deal again? neah can't really compare island countries honestly happens people start get manipulated questioning validity science. 

Science give straight facts face. doesnt matter like not, reality clear.

but people fucking stupid shit would rather believe baseless feeeeeelings evidence based facts. *Hugs*

I truly sorry loss.

Those people suck humans. Especially role modern (social) media true. much information gets harder harder properly filter fact fiction. good realize *nobody* immune propaganda. Hearing storyline affect anyone. Even smartest, intellectual person planet, opinions influenced. main reason believe self regulation major platforms power dictate public opinion. People right opinion nobody right facts. Suicides also quite significantly. come close explaining away 300k excessive deaths we're year, ignored. numbers collected summarised document, simply ask Socialstyrelsen send you. objection (that know of) raise parts might classified might internal working material. Ask shall receive :)  think Chinese ""ultra nationalistic"", much Americans. ""Industry working hand hand government"", statement shows familiar Chinese society. sizable private sector business owners like everyone else, anything profits. ""Appealing glory history"" fascism. eastern asian countries like this, Korean ""appealing glory history"" even changed name capital city. Authoritarian, yes, left wing authoritarian facism.  city, fucking embarrassment. figured White House took releasing official numbers stayed stalled 200k literal months. use see deaths classified rather saying obviously covid. realize Japanese infectious disease laws REQUIRE infectious disease patients hospitalized, right???

So rather put relatively healthy people limited number infectious disease beds have, they're sending people home hotels likely recover own. real. welding peoples apartment doors, taking peoples temps forcefully dragging hospital quarantine. took extreme measures try get shit control.

He's ""predicted"" massive COVID19 outbreak Japan since virus first became news. He's posted deleted several accounts uses uses twitter primary source information because, according him, Japanese scientific community cannot trusted. ""The virus active china 5 months major action taken.""

This virus bats years probably matter. 

The first person infected proven november discovered Februari due test frozen sample. 

It first identified around new year strict lockdown 25th January. New cases started dropping soon after. less month.

Due lack tests (there none early weeks) many people diagnosed. real numbers higher reported. Probably 10k dead 300k infected according local doctors.

The 84k number quote officially tested number people infected, dead.

The Chinese government, faults, aware high population public transit system knew without draconian actions, millions would die China. 

They went got virus control China. countries done seems Asian countries New Zealand got message. Thank you. I'm going keep working it. They're literally fascist. Ultra nationalistic, industry working hand hand government, appealing glory history, authoritarian. 

I Chinese born visited often. place racism, simple description government now.

The far right wing America literally fascist well. want America long they're control supports values. would highly unusual virus mutate dangerous form. Usually viruses like host live long enough spread.

not saying cant happen, cause certainly wouldnt want to, would highly unusual, impossible Yet people claiming lockdowns destroy economy. What's based exactly?

My point preliminary data support assertion. I'm particular argument lockdowns baseless. can't believe people downvoting this. Fuck China. ""covid money"" thing start? getting paid people die 1 disease another, writing checks fund that? like research grant type thing get Ingo disease every doctor every hospital country getting piece pie willfully fraud documents? seriously want know that's real thing concept make sense me. I‚Äôm sorry, wasn‚Äôt aware made less dollar job choice working. also wasn‚Äôt aware lived squalor legally-regulated temperature control regard climate. wasn‚Äôt aware spent time said squalor limited contact friends family, knowing someone would kick shit chow line honey bun bag chips. That‚Äôs bad knowing that, dude. know, since we‚Äôre sharing information, tax dollars contribute providing top-of-the-line medical care president willingly exposed deadly virus sheer idiocy police victimize fellow taxpayers daily basis providing state federal inmates Club Med experience?

In short, fuck ignorant opinion. combination. needs both. Responsible leadership reasonable population. Also proper media plays big role. non essential businesses shut. Chemists, supermarkets couriers basically it, urgent call outs repairers like plumbers allowed. Butchers, cafes, gyms shut everyone else working home. asked stay local. swimming, boat activities, adventurous sports shit hit fan needed rescuing endanger someone else - know anything kiwis, sucked. DN pretty good table covering regions, also detailed time series plot Stockholm VG regions. 

Right 171 patients hospital covid nationally, 22 ICU. they'll keep shouting ""prove it"" till see pile dead corpses rotting sun big sign saying ""covid infected corpses""

but even they'll say bs hushed voice (very seriously) said never say words controversy.

What expect say referring political entity? vehicle miles traveled dropped massively lockdown traffic fatalities overall dropped.  Care share? Stay strong friend! official press releases, literally find number asymptomatic cases among tested positive Qingdao. 30% deaths far arent counted yea guess would helpful focus example age groups test positive in, well many infected live nursing homes. 

ICU numbers pretty good measurement, since nursing home patients seldom go hospital. difficult see whole picture. ""up to"" used truthful way headlines? feeling improvement expected mid/late January.

For reason. Tl dr virus live 28 days surfaces 20¬∞ hours 40¬∞ Judging comments people clearly reading article. use word fascism lightly, way right wing discredit enemy.  ""news""? mean, already know several months. simply compare 2019 mortality rates 2020 got pretty good idea real death toll.

But mean, article considered ""news"". nothing new. make exact article November, exchange 200,000 300,000 we're done. strict thing true. visited fiancee summer came back home afterward. called three days quarantine began tell stay home. that, 'ArriveCan' app asked self-assessment every day buggy stopped working properly nine days. 

I break quarantine I'm good citizen gives fuck, totally could without real consequence. Lol yeah it‚Äôs many exists. Also super strict lockdowns study. places like Wuhan Madrid locked hard basically stopped transmitted. That‚Äôs millions people getting deliveries less Yep. Yet Czech government September basically enacted masks reaction rising infection numbers reaping results that. spent inordinate amount time quarreling masks yes masks no, sometimes absurd detail, instead focusing much needed measures.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  comes mind uk study showing number deaths due lockdown nearly half deaths covid. due people trying go hospital, delay example cancer treatments.

this estimated around 25k, covid got 40k.

so higher overall deaths, necessarily mean covid deaths, could also mean deaths due restrictions. sorry loss. don‚Äôt know I‚Äôd position. close sister, idea death trivialized political/ideological agendas sickening. 

I truly sorry loss. want chat anything, send message. Japan's strategy opening windows sometimes. maybe limits crowd sizes. That's it. That's resulted cluster tracing bit data says virus spread mostly indoors.

If look social mobility, correlates case trends. cases dropped conjunction mobility drops associated holidays.

One could argue many Japanese people essentially trust government, staying home lot. changing. Fatigue setting in. Japan introspective. Everything always sunny Tokyo, best people doing. So, inertia shifts complacent, that's happen.

Just time cold weather.

The government promoting travel campaign god's sake. clinical trials familiar with? wearing mask, make harder ignore reality virus. like worldviews challenged. Trump first close borders china. Biden said xenophobic wrong wrong good argument still stand think America perhaps ignoring many cases, can‚Äôt make sense U.K. death rate 7% US 2.5%. free healthcare one would hesitate go hospital symptoms.... doesn‚Äôt make sense, unless covid doesn‚Äôt like American humans much British? got loads downvotes start questioned America‚Äôs death rate numbers Europe‚Äôs. Trump trying play whole thing hard is, really hard believe might manipulating numbers? I‚Äôd interested find many deaths ‚Äúpossibly due to‚Äù recorded covid death. numbers taken  Australia among worlds best testing per 1m pop outbreak. hardly anyone test looks like testing shit ruin evening standing yourself, ruined evening smoothbrains. cluster strategy.

They show late clusters. find excuses test people clusters (has symptoms wore mask close contact patient four hours? eh, need test, wore mask).

Their cluster tracing prevented zero spread. use isolate contain spread, even all. survey ask questions take responses truth. China finished 2nd survey believed numbers told. I'm sure many people countries believe numbers coming China anymore.  report good convincing people everything control. level control detail possible handful cases IMO, hard part early lock downs required get cases low begin with. Starting today, teaching via Zoom more. Slovakia apparently going heavy lockdown again. Japan indeed large-scale testing program, strategy focused super-spreading events backwards tracing &amp; isolation interesting merits. least positivity rate hospital occupancy suggest hidden super-outbreak (which difficult hide anyway). Fully agree problem social stigma though. 

Is going get worse autumn/winter? Probably, think argue strategy far completely unsuccessful considering Japan major destination Wuhan tourists (Thailand another noteworthy example) pandemic mitigated quite well 9 months without ever undergoing strict lockdown. right hate it. partly effective, it‚Äôll work much better populations immunity already you‚Äôll killed far people economic cost isolation slamming economy shut every months leaks quarantine Knowledge power . remember ONE source truth. decent studies rate long term effects occur though?


I googled around bit could find (from reputable sources, news outlets) vague expressions like ""some patients may experience x z weeks months"".  pin country's failure protect people China. I've heard exact opposite! They're fudging numbers hospitals pretty much common knowledge now. you‚Äôre saying governments grandiose plan stop virus getting bonkers? Germany experiencing accelerating infection numbers right now. think see handle second wave now, general agree response decent brings national infection average, obvs. COVID almost certainly causing unprecedented rates.

Prove US lying bad pandemic is, time telling world China lying bad Pandemic is, reddit accepts arguments without thought. compare Trump CCP. That's insult. CCP never absurd Trump. know why, republican governor. Well, take measures lower death rate reduce chance accidents.

What people doing, like driving around foot pedal, seatbelt eyes closed, cause dying car crash hoax.

Also, dying car crash constant danger. spread go away vaccine. different situation. Yeah...of course find that. Unsung hero  flu season? Taiwan cool winter, still warmer European spring, Vietnam warmer still. Nah, Idiocracy people genetically getting dumber. human species go throw relevant genetic change 100 years.

This entirely due lack education rise social media. also tourism drinking. Masks obviously thing plays role. Many epidemiologist warned masks exact reason, people would give false confidence masks. would thing long wear masks, nothing happened. work way, 100% 0. single source that's japanese propaganda?

Little hospital occupancy **like said**, turning away people. requirements get testing unnecessarily high. Except data literally shows 70,000 deaths were. Duh. Nothing said made-up. Go back troll farm. even ironing without washing...better nothing honest I've time. need buy masks enough able wash daily without inconveniencing lol. Bro, I'm Qingdao finished test afternoon, true. Old info. joke details. .**On airplane** anybody masked Social distancing - sure. speak risk while: boarding, airport, deplaning, baggage claim crowd, public transport airport on. posted CEO Speech+study covering days?

It political wording finest. Also study lead statement Sponsored (funded?) aviation industry.

Sorry english, hope everybody understand core meaning post. Comes luck. people follow rules plane sure safe. takes one knob removing mask though. Roll dice, see happens.. Loss sense smell! totalitarianism accounts COVID response. people west love using card excuse fundamental failings (and perhaps greatest strength) western society individualism.

individualism lack thinking acting greater good partly responsible absolute mess Western countries' response. citizen compliance feeling moral duty important government measures. instead, see anti lockdown protests US Europe people droves, butthurt wear mask see someone months? selfish thoughts actions reason US Europe still coronavirus mess, Taiwan, South Korea, China New Zealand are.

Thankfully, policies implemented, situation reversed within 6 weeks everyone breathed sigh relief
It's important gives doctors, nurses, outbreak control staff general public glimpse light hope, rather always way state, afaik (as May), couldn‚Äôt even get tested unless matched common symptom criteria.

But goes say expected, since claims clinical trials rather uncommon. Volunteers sign informed consent forms covers stuff could go wrong. Claims tend happen trial run sloppy way, product tested generating adverse effects. can't protest home. kingdom supposed inside though, keep inside you. get though, raised church, need money, desperately.

Im tired discussion.... decent read. study test data would really helpful. 23, 9 a.m. Online
It's October. Yes, was. compassion people whose loved ones died pandemic rather judging much blame were. appreciate Reuters telling needs are. get decide needs are.

And Reuters tells article informational bagatelles can't anything affect life way. anything misdirection away truly need know, order occupy mind think deeper issues.

By obvious there's thing ""herd immunity"" covid. Reinfection occur short time frame months following recovery. person gets covid might recover get reinfected infinite number times rest life. could vaccines receive four five times year ensure never gets covid again. No, like seasonal flu vaccine covid flu. covid vaccine would much bigger deal stakes much higher potential screwups horrifying. light people acting like idiots completely failing frank discussion hell going avoid covid worry us multiple times year rest lives.

The residual damage caused covid poorly presented public information. scattered snippets nothing pulls together coherent picture. variously heard disparate scattered sources of: even asymptomatic recovered covid patients lung damage; recovered covid patients one year subsequent life expectancy thanks respiratory complications; average life expectancy following recovery covid severe enough require hospitalization, 10 years; covid caused heart ischemia patients (such major league baseball pitcher--this widely reported sports media followed on); worryingly covid may affect male fertility. Way back February saw couple scattered mentions male covid patients becoming infertile. seen anything since then. Surely issue deserves proper follow up, yet people behaving like developmentally delayed children taking least bit seriously.

What need know health care experts virology experts honestly believe risk humanity world, much trouble in. Instead distracted lot stupid misdirection gives media way file daily news stories daily news cycle. adults right properly informed realities lives. Treating us like we're stupid shallow clumsy distractions insulting importantly us wrong. clear spread infection smaller spring, says Karin Tegmark Wisell points difficulty explaining differences current situation summer, time emphasize seriousness current situation.

\- tested extent spring, number cases would much higher cases registered weeks. want send message serious situation situation last spring. try take different data best clear communication, becomes complex, says.

**Are parameters compared spring?**

\- case, would admissions iva, fairly stable parameter.

Severely ill reported Public Health Agency's reporting number admissions intensive care unit - number week 15 400 25. death toll counts everyone registered dead, doctor population register, died within 30 days received covid diagnosis.

**But compare iva, mean minimal spread infection compared spring?**

\- Yes, yes. must also add age groups spread infection takes place. society exposed affects ICU admissions deaths, something completely obvious.

One basic goals Swedish Public Health Agency's management corona pandemic protect vulnerable covid-19. many people die become seriously ill important indicator well succeed that. even measurements misleading handled correctly, says Anna Mia Ekstr√∂m.

\- one hand, admissions IVA interesting given everyone needs care receives strategies around given intensive care change. Sweden's many countries' ways measuring deaths also problematic, given died covid-19 reported, rather died disease. Given many died old, fragile often multi-sick several diagnoses potentially fatal, give skewed picture actual death toll, says.

Information IVA care deaths also provide measure effective care caring severely affected disease.

\- proportion die IVF decreases, may indication become better caring become seriously ill. Today, much known care works best, compared earlier pandemic, even important measure specific treatment methods, Anna Mia Ekstr√∂m continues.

**In many countries,** great focus reproduction number, often abbreviated R number. Swedish Public Health Agency lifted isolated cases. R-number measures many people sick person infects average. R number one, spread infection increases, one, decreases.

But calculating R-zero, ie many people infected sick person average, provided immunity, restrictions factors stop spread, complicated, says Fredrik Liljeros, professor sociology expert contact patterns' impact spread infection.

\- much easier disease like measles, contagious infect pretty much everyone meet. matter take bus, go store work, says.

The infectious nature new coronavirus complex. spread takes place mainly indoors long close contact lasts affects risk infection. must added additional factors, stage infection contagious many close contacts individual has.

\- much must taken account, case R-number quite irrelevant. calculations R-number covid-19 would meet requirements credible scientific journal, says Fredrik Liljeros.

**There measure** alone explain spread infection looks like, say Fredrik Liljeros, Anna Mia Ekstr√∂m Karin Tegmark Wisell.

\- get away take different parameters. give understanding development right now, others better suited compare countries. easy compare apples pears need look broadly. challenge, lot right now, says Karin Tegmark compare countries  countries gives different results depending whether figure set relation population size not. exemplify Sweden, Denmark, United Kingdom, Czech Republic, Netherlands Italy.  cases last 24 hours:**  Kingdom: 13,864  Republic: 8,617  5,971  5,372  919  444  days total number confirmed cases per 100,000 inhabitants:**  Republic: 451.2  322.8  Kingdom: 228.7  104.1  72.5  62.2   Kingdom: 87  Republic: 36  28  13  2  2  days total number deaths per 100,000 inhabitants:**  Republic: 3.0  1.2  Kingdom: 1.1  0.5  0.3  0.2  daily figures infected dead 9 October.*  ECDC, Worldometer.* Look happened parents Sandy Hook. thing. many stupid people country. Right back you. I‚Äôm sorry loss too. 

This shitty club in. last seasons Covid, coming winter...New Covid, 30% death! Catch gathering near you! see happens, would rule new large-scale lockdowns next 6 months.

This I'm preparing for. never fully got mode went back work. threat second quarantine always looking me. gives feeling.
After witnessed first hand China handled it, give credit. letting everyone pack travel large groups holiday, they've lost little confidence things getting back normal here. ""Structural racism""


Now R crowd read MELBOURNE/SYDNEY (Reuters) - virus causes COVID-19 survive banknotes, glass stainless steel 28 days, much longer flu virus, Australian researchers said Monday, highlighting need cleaning handwashing combat virus.

Findings study done Australia‚Äôs national science agency, CSIRO, appear show controlled environment virus remained infectious longer studies found.

CSIRO researchers found 20 degrees Celsius (68 degrees Fahrenheit) SARS-COV-2 virus remained infectious 28 days smooth surfaces plastic banknotes glass found mobile phone screens. study published Virology Journal.

By comparison, Influenza virus found survive surfaces 17 days.

Experiments done 20, 30 40 degrees C showed virus survived longer cooler temperatures, longer smooth surfaces complex surfaces cotton, longer paper banknotes plastic banknotes.

‚ÄúSo heading summer that‚Äôs certainly going important factor virus won‚Äôt last long warmer temperatures,‚Äù Riddell said, referring upcoming southern hemisphere summer.

All experiments done dark remove impact ultraviolet light, research shown direct sunlight kill virus.

‚ÄúSo real world results would likely shorter able show,‚Äù Riddell told Reuters.

Researchers said given proteins fats body fluids also sharply increase virus survival times, study may help explain apparent persistence spread virus cool environments like meat-packing facilities.

Australia fared much better rich nations combating COVID-19, total 27,000 infections 898 deaths population 25 million.

The epicentre country‚Äôs second wave infection, Victoria state, reported 15 new cases Monday, well shy target less five government set easing hard lockdown state capital Melbourne.

New South Wales, populous state, reported six new cases Monday, five returned travelers quarantine. fix easily. make statement causes people act certain way die, charged murder. Watch quickly people turn tested science instead advice people motivated outside factors. turning away patients hospitals? Therefore main suspicion right sort cross containment within hospital. Ya, no. Basically deaths occurred since February attributed Covid study. inflates numbers already are. course cite racism reason ""disadvantaged"" communities deaths. crock. Read again. time period ‚Äòstudy January July. 1.2bn many jan - March time frame virus widespread? guess 1.2bn airlines barely running since. many countries world proper contact tracing jan-July. answer few. UK USA example still don‚Äôt proper contact tracing. ‚Äòstudy‚Äô complete garbage. really think standing line people locked aluminum tube people several hours I‚Äôve got bridge sell you. 
Here one example happened. load... Text? Whenever see someone without mask one (and mean mask around neck eating smoking, mean mask public) try make mean song sing them. Right I'm this:

Twinkle twinkle little star

You're monster yes are

Please put face mask on

Then sing sad song

Twinkle... 

Haven't punched yet I'm looking forward it. centuries believed fomites viruses cause infections - flus, colds coronaviruses. Back March stated main reason virus spread. six months later, centuries since beginning modern science, suddenly not! None seems make sense. hard know believe. think similar reports puts western suffering perspective. busy comparing numbers much worse catastrophy happening poorer countries.

This mean lockdowns bad lockdowns scale. dont think lock Ivorytowers anymore thinking ourselves. said make immune system less effective, possible. However, even that's case, still count death covid otherwise grandfather would got lease died it. I‚Äôm sorry. really Uhhhhh, go get help dude deaths excess 200k virus, they're lockdown. Headline best act like new virus deaths. could go back kid leader model. everything demanded paywalls also went tabloid. disincentives bloat. problem is, ppl take numbers argue, death due lockdown.

More often morons /r/conspiracy making bad faith arguments herd immunity.

I understand could lead psychological issues; case lockdowns caused mass suicides, despite coroners medical examiners reporting spike yet, nothing gibberish people interested real discussion.

Take good. Leave bad. That‚Äôs grow person nation. However, singling out, chasing down, brutally beating Jewish reporter certainly sounds like work nazis. sad part little WHO, CDC even virologists seem know bacteria viruses infect humans. beginning pandemic March, consensus among science health advisors one infected fomites flu, coronavirus colds. little research advisement this? depend other. balance needs found measures too. Putting economy lives hurt economy enough lives keep running properly vice versa. Australia says hi - we've got shit nailed

We sell tourist visas 1M+ rich people willing month quarantine.. we'd make fucking mint. missed point would put US deaths 292,400 (based current 215,000 reported deaths) sick. want go way let know that. Absolutely sick. keep up. stats later concise review actions learn them.  Well, ""a bit"" often enough even pretty hard office 8-5, especially winter. happened anywhere lol. Spain [has highest mask Europe, biggest second wave long last forever 

They need last long enough numbers controlled available infrastructure, whether means quarantine borders, effective track trace, short-term/mass testing, whatever else yet enforced 

Yes, need enforced, means licensing checks venues, importantly, need build consent. need set expectations long they'll last reassure people they'll reviewed. Saying ""This new normal, it'll illegal meet friends next ten years take family swimming strangers."" extent realistically possible.

See above. build consent, makes lockdowns easier, important target numbers target end dates - all, strategy shows future lockdown avoided. 

If decide going lock down, nothing reduce risk recurrence, revert protective measures open up, lockdown basically achieve nothing deferring cases deaths would happened, happen anyway. Theres lot cognitive dissonance country right now. really scary actually see LACK education playing role America right now. People entangled beleifs basically religion them. 

This reality TV folks. like crawled brain verbalized also feel same. husband said wear masks thing bullshit get go wore makeshift homemade masks early Booster shots. baseless fear mongering need course.

""extra"" money barely offsets lost money services normally provide. small exception wrong.

While people died range, 80%. 210,000, leaves 42,000 age range. fact. 

If family member one 80, really matter ""most"" 80, huh?

I know you, care family members 80.

So see admitting can't think critically. Cool. Thanks pointing out. read text comparison see providing example figures change use different metrics. I‚Äôve good luck asking people well, it‚Äôs 100% true people assaulted same. moron (in opinion) believe right people disagree morons. Sorry sound bright. spare made stats. Listen, Gates smart guy know thing two Covid. question, recent circle jerking worship knowledgeable Covid expert planet beyond laughable. dare say otherwise people start PMing hate mail. guys need get grip. like saying ""COVID hasnt hit me, therefore scam"" ofc people assaulted trying en force masks, dude, ¬øDidnt hear french bus driver killed? Like, every Latin American country locked hard, apart Brazil Mexico, drowning dead? number 14 means fourteenth worst world. 200 countries better.

To pretend somehow means jot bad ludicrous.

There absolutely point doing. Wait home country can‚Äôt get shot togrther?  that's best thing do, best thing virus is! virus ""give up"". it'll keep going pounce! humans stupid naive you? hostage diplomacy. Diplomacy means pressuring kind result. Canada dare cross neighbor. Releasing Meng entirely Trump. Canada say it, China knows that. detaining two Michaels simply Chinese government responding popular demand retaliation China. 'blood must blood', nothing complicated like diplomacy. connection gyms outbreaks. understand people need outlet relief stress cooped inside it‚Äôs -20 outside 5 month really going take toll lot us. empathy, Christ. island doesn‚Äôt mean shit primary means dispersal around world air travel.

It does, people coming airplanes tracked quarantined far easily coming foot, car train. Especially one two main international airports.

And US fact huge advantage compared Europe least. US's management whole pandemic mess think anyone disagrees that. time vaccines work. Yep, lockdowns work, long last forever enforced extent realistically possible. Otherwise, work. makes angry despite that, containment strategies might work, nope. 

What odd testing poor Europe America. Unlike manufacturing masks, pretty low-tech, covid testing relatively high-tech matter. kind thing rich advanced places like America Europe far better poorer, backwards countries like China. Detectable antibodies usually last months viruses. immune system would outright break actively making antibodies everything encountered. gain basically body remembering produce antibodies next infection. mean people still saying Sandy Hook hoax keep sending parents dead kids death threats trying take away guns lies.

What psychological disorder this? 8.5% positivity rate 11th. lucky bunch people running warehouse could hole town year. Business crazy good customers cared availability, price. spent summer Washington Idaho regions saw couple people day. long cellphone connection 7-3, spot perfect camping.

I came back home cast absentee ballot heading somewhere warmer. Perhaps Appalachia move Arizona New Year. definitely don‚Äôt want near city Nov 3rd. Hard say numbers small. export cases months one month 4 cases could've family group. sign generally they're hiding significant number cases. halfway mean close another year viable product hits American populations, yes   point-you vet sources. 

I feel like covid info misinformation right now. Even legit places lied us flip flopped. First wear masks. wear masks. aerosolized, not, yes is. Oh watch surfaces, surfaces bad OH surfaces awful! 

Like think people kinda gave stopped caring try figure facts. know did. first finding facts info could get. info kept changed over-I stopped caring. one keep up. ""But young people almost chance dying! Protect elderly keep going bars!""

Oh wait, young take care elderly home nursing homes. people comorbidities actively working community, side side young people general public. help children navigate school work elearning. cashier grocery store work deli.

""Sequester vulnerable instead imposing restrictions"" always fantasy. regret anything said context time said it, correct. told task force meetings serious problem lack PPEs masks health providers putting harm's way every day take care sick people,"" Fauci told O'Donnell. became clear infection could spread asymptomatic carriers know they're infected, made clear strongly recommend masks,"" also, soon became clear enough protective equipment cloth masks homemade masks good masks would buy surgical supply stores,"" Fauci added. ""So context strongly recommending it, correct thing.""

Anyone paying slightest bit attention actual releases CDC Fauci would know that. bad misinformation rampant platforms people blindly repeating false narrative. brother who‚Äôs diabetic special needs already feel like society shuns people like out, making disgusted lot people. COVID situation, feel even disgust.

Especially since ""JUST PEOPLE PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS"" crap justification failure. one saying Trump admin. failed contain virus. mean operate ""intended""? kind misnomer. Since Covid-19 testing easily done premises widespread, patient treated dies, becomes billing item. could go truly try investigate truly death caused COVID, due amount medical personal would need utilized state US healthcare, find acceptable billing range submit that. 


So really hospitals truly trying nickel &amp; dime ""poor insurance companies"", rather simplify transactions within stupid US healthcare system. 


I friends healthcare administration health insurance.  Wasnt phneumonia consecuence covid? Genuine question Researchers University Hong Kong said Monday found way tackle novel coronavirus drug commonly used treat stomach said experiments laboratory showed drug, ranitidine bismuth citrate (RBC), contains metal called bismuth, used **reduce viral loads coronavirus-infected cells 1,000-fold**.

Last week 1 day Tokyo conducted 1039 tests, 142 positive. 13% positivity rate.

For today, around 6988 tests conducted: weekend Monday thing, testing Japan extremely low. Spain's response nothing short barbaric. really doubt second scientific thought behind window game. $486m 100,000 doses seems like got bent over. lie coronavirus deaths, flu decide take year off? .......we know. We‚Äôve known while. We‚Äôve using low estimates entire time. mean, actually government buys millions doses you‚Äôve even proven works. Haha butthurt invent false situation make feel better. actually wasn‚Äôt case least states.

Although vehicle miles dropped, therefore total crashes dropped, people driving faster due less traffic, fatality rates higher crashes occur Read article. People don‚Äôt like truth, half group thinks lockdown developing country like India till virus disappears gyms literally one least risky places catch virus ,unlike bars, actually something helpful body people think U.S. best hospitals, doctors, medical care world. There's nothing fix system. claim corrupt full liars . lockdown shown harm economy letting virus surge without timeframe? not, economy argument lockdown Sweden similar negative impact rest Nordics?

Yes. What's excuse? Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* fairness, also lie *a lot.*

I remember changed way counted cases make number infected seem less. 4 times witness even though done like 6-7 times total. sub long enough, 'member this, too. Read article dummy Try honest instead ""framing"" things want appear. said agree China done great job every country taken seriously China did, would over. 

The problem people personal liberty, it‚Äôs still growing exponentially places much less crowded China. Golden week travel happening, article seems justify travel. time tell truth however. Unlike CCP paid shills scaredy cats brainwashed authoritarian media subreddit, real human beings actual lives want move on, without government support. Unlike Brasil Argentina closed everything early. strong lock down, that's spikes late. lock enough, something population maintain long, raise. Super cringey. slip ups feel it‚Äôs way towards control. Partial lockdown Klang Valley new clusters emerge. Good timing imo.

Illegal immigrants coming Sabah (in Borneo) political campaign (ugh politicians) caused second wave. science based article that's headline. That's sensationalist stuffed anecdotal evidence, I'm sure aware, evidence all.

but get mean. many people read titles take fact. They're sure good picking non-comparable countries (except Denmark) make Sweden look best class (which they're not). doubt hicks drive-by covid coughing PoC neighborhoods majority deaths from, maybe time communities hold responsible take pandemic little seriously Pretty clear would care check.

President Donald Trump demanded vaccine, U.S. Department Health Human Services (HHS) agreed provide $1.2 billion accelerate British drugmaker AstraZeneca‚Äôs vaccine development secure 300 million doses United States. Actually, think wrong there. 

**In opinion**, two major reasons restrictions seem work:

1. Majority people masks nose use single single-use mask least week without exchange.
2. Majority people give fuck covid refuse limit way, especially limit pub/restaurants visiting habits. single country managed beat virus used ""authoritarian"" measures

Its made fairly clear certain percentage population plain stupid comes things like needs system place make sure comply benefit society whole.... don‚Äôt. I‚Äôve read virus less prone mutations. say New York City, Northern Italy, Sweden, crisis seems subsided makes case form generalized immunity populations virus ran early lockdowns. I‚Äôm right - New Zealand handling sadistic possible way - suffer time. It‚Äôs first world privilege, brother law traveled Benin Nigeria go wedding Lagos. 
A good friend mine went Ghana Togo buy cheaper clothes market bit ignorant assume it‚Äôs rich this. we‚Äôre still better shit hole, suck u going drink beers mask on? I'm bandwagon I'm moron. pay attention world. same, know Bill Gates knowledgeable 99.99% population infectious diseases, beyond that, gets information directly people knowledgeable 99.99999% people matter. this! typical czech behaviour - taking responsibility rather blaming others fuck ups. Reminds back June people said thing cases increasing tests increasing. It‚Äôs Sunday. record Sunday? point shifted, first said lockdowns necessary. you‚Äôre saying they‚Äôre necessary people they‚Äôre told start behaving correctly. response like UK, people told behave correctly point, one day, lockdown imposed without prior warning. Perhaps countries would‚Äôve done better citizens advised adopt certain measures locked down. say China haven‚Äôt done well figures absolutely trusted. intrigued countries say best (with exception New Zealand) horrible human rights records. Timor-Leste imposed lockdown better every country listed. No. point holidays don‚Äôt stop of
outside problems. get adapted. Greetings Germany, here. percentage idiots decide ignore guidelines waltz around place waiting test turns positive. Typhoid Miche√°l M√°ire. heads up, immediately see issue comment one person something carries clear risk without issue tell anything circumstances. Also account 13 days old lot people coming new purchased accounts spread misinformation encourage people engage risky behavior spread virus. No. wouldn‚Äôt personally adhere even one. I‚Äôve done reasonably I‚Äôm it. think lot people feel same. First 2 weeks, 3 days, month? huge difference? 
How notice this? making crazy, understand. every single thing virus keep swinging one extreme time? 
Is virus? virologists bloody stupid? someone leave petri dish microwave instead fridge? 
Did label wrong? shmuck sneeze old sample? it?
A month days? it? Goddamnit. 
Why feel like every bit information designed make spin circles flapping arms. can't believe anything. reverse week! bother keeping news this? pointless it? sure sarcastic, China actually spread opposite. disinfo basically making sound super scary boost popularity heavy restrictions blaming countries creating/spreading virus shift blame. There's database different narratives see compiled. ""just flu"" crowd American/right-wing invention. temperature least 140 degrees. no, guys going that.

how ineffective masks? read actual study, even used correctly talking 16% reduction risk infection wear one properly every day 30 days. know people want hear that's enough stop contagious upper respiratory infection, slow little bit. herd immunity strategy, inevitability.

never thankful live small town, even servers cashiers often participate political virtue signaling. number people know covid-19 14, every single one fine week. person know died older relative. ever contract covid 19, fell injured therapy delayed bc lockdowns, died weeks later hospital bed unable move last several days Wow like kicked ass entire world would leave China behind /s Brief timeline: 


2020/10/10, 3 patient tested Positive hospitalized operations,recognised asymptomatic carriers. 
 still clear likely infected days went hospital receiving abroad Positive cases. 


2020/10/11, contacted ppl medical staff tested, , 9 new positive cases, 4 r recognized confirmed cases, 2 10/10 asymptomatic turned confirmed cases. 
So far 6 confirmed cases, 6 asymptomatic carriers. 

Local authority declared mass/whole population PCR testings , 6 million citizens. communities started night 10/11 Beijing Time 

 Source;: Qingdao Health Department confirmed local(me:) ) unions even right besides collecting dues? evidence certain viruses provide cross-immunity. may gotten one protected them. said anus instead butthole? seek right-wing media order obtain ""news"" probably right-wing search emotional support reinforcement.

If gave NPR, would assume lies. change positions. mean like refrigerators pantries? ignore fact pandemic going eating among riskiest things do?

Why want make things worse? alt account number 2 3? Democratic governors issuing closures, Democratic-voting people wearing masks, know. 

Actually, Republicans done right thing, too. yeah, Trump's saved 2.2 million mostly Democrats. know places Arizona Texas got stressed, Wisconsin getting stressed now. long happens different places different times, resources allocated (same way treat hurricanes disasters). 1 point higher still higher book every point counts comes America.  guess relative. 6 months ago lot friends leave homes. everyone gets together like real change crowds little smaller. big difference beginning things. Dude like .5% death rate. Idk tell chill reply another comment:

I mean decades cdc public health orgs told us washing hands number one risk catching cold flu, ‚Äúdoor knob example‚Äù extremely well known anecdote.

Telling people Fomites aren‚Äôt dangerous egregious lie. Fomites *less* likely infect near sick person breathing droplets.

But risk fomite transmission still huge. touch coronavirus contaminated surface, scratch face, incredibly high chance getting infected. Bill gates needs shut fuck up. wonder much longer.  love entire world conspired hurt presidents US Brazil. went far tank economies hurt them. Viewing excess deaths point time whilst alarming completely flawed way looking excess deaths. 

Given death certainty people, spike excess deaths bringing forward deaths future present. 

The question far forward deaths brought long curve turns negative. 

If look chart OP see matter time weekly excess deaths turns negative indicating really occurred died coronavirus made significant number people likely died near term.   Uh. pointing misread post buddy. I'm touching rest tantrum. That's way IQ scores works though. Mussolini hilarious?! started slow slowly consistently increased measures (worked part many excess deaths). rest world started strict eased (saving lives). problem places like USA UK example extremely inconsistent time thus mess in.  I'm sure said wrong. listening something today said virus bad, previously particular thing downplayed it. Maybe change get people take seriously. damn Japanese their

*Shuffles card*

Unaging population listen man funded vaccines disease research years years going listen specialist insects? ""Nice place here, shame something happened it."" \*pushes vase floor sprays covid. mean we'll argue virus agree it'll stop infecting people stop working vaccines Christmas?

That would great would agree that. spray thing trump rallies problem solved. Rest Americans wearing masks.  Yeah got horrible case conjunctivitis symptomatic viral bacterial allergic pink eye. eye itch even little bit got extremely swollen, red watery. even want touch eye, let alone rub it. hurt close eye. Took three days swelling go away full week eyes white again. Oh happened traveled plane Florida went couple places mask compliance iffy. theory nose mouth protected, virus simply got system via eyes. single symptom except really fucked eye.

Also think Mike Pence's eye fucked knows may air cold storage unit, necessarily transmitted touch. get point making? owned computer company know stuff? trump lots money, tax credits like karens get store credit. WHO's policy actually set US itself. last time declared pandemic countries shat overreacting called investigations.

..

 ‚ÄúIt never fails amaze every time outbreak happens, everyone says, ‚Äòwhy that?‚Äô‚Äù Clare Wenham, professor global health policy London School Economics, told *Bulletin*. 

‚Äú**For \[WHO‚Äôs\] existence, it‚Äôs shaped significant degree whatever United States would allow be, would allow be**,‚Äù Zimmer said.

What actually mean, then, powerful members, United States America, sternly turns around points finger blame WHO‚Äîand, small regard, 99+% people beat it. would unusual didn't. us never stopped? Ok USAs death rate trumps fault? You‚Äôre still proving point matter office would situation worse. Quit blaming trump harassing every second get maybe could focus country instead focusing always defending lying media. Shut Bill. immigrant Middle East went naturalization become Dutch, seems funny me, almost like comedy sketch. 


So many native Dutch people complain way immigrants gender roles, heart Netherlands, got conservative Dutch people same... unclear incivil.

Should said anus instead butthole? Well, way play it. good players, definitely Taishiea used GOP logic, ineffective would think decades smoking already means give shit health known March, April latest. Today October.. resurface New Zealand? saying might best idea. worked. shutting restaurants pubs. Mandatory masks encourage people work home. That‚Äôs lockdown enough. US healthcare worker here. work two sites. one hands deck since started. management disappeared WFH. Emails go unanswered days. 


My town taken huge hit. Tourism healthcare drive it. Tourism died recently, we're getting lot folks TX midwest (I'm NC). Healthcare took hit many people put hospital visits non emergency surgeries. anywhere besides NYC hospitals significantly overwhelmed? Considering there's quite lot countries thing - I? make point clearly. little universal healthcare, country dealt containing virus. can't speak threat guy's groceries global supply rubbing alcohol, there's zero chance poisoning. Alcohol stick around long enough. could use hand sanitizer stick fingers mouth 30 seconds later every day rest life perfectly fine. food *packaging* even close risk.  

I've using bleach water wipe outside packages come house including groceries (to extent practical so). That's slightly risky, long careful get food fine. So...does ""nationwide lockdown"" mean Gov't LAW keeping inside? mean? Like threat kind ""penalty?""  mean? Damn thought they'd obfuscating numbers, sure 8 million cases many risk factors thought would way way more.

Mexico example 800k cases 80k deaths, insane. Qatar study, 130,000 positive cases, 15,808 tested positive twice (after testing negative). alone right would 12%. first antibody studies done China showed 5-7% patients hospitalized COVID detectable levels neutralizing antibodies. 

If see problem, there's nothing convince arguing feelings rather science. sense ""lockdown"" used posting, quarantines kind lockdown, nobody want spend 2-weeks-vacation quarantine. Nobody quarantine go dining vacation-shopping thereby pay meals hungry children.

The problem everybody definitions lockdown guess people say. mean decades cdc public health orgs told us washing hands number one risk catching cold flu, ‚Äúdoor knob example‚Äù extremely well known anecdote.

Telling people Fomites aren‚Äôt dangerous egregious lie. Fomites *less* likely infect near sick person breathing droplets.

But risk fomite transmission still huge. touch coronavirus contaminated surface, scratch face, incredibly high chance getting infected.

Sometimes think CDC thinks people stupid worry two vectors. emphasize importance masks, feel downplay fomites. It‚Äôs harmful. assault spray towards anti-vaxxers? read source thought meant spray anti maskers faces like pepper spray Normally, said many possible oft seen reasons noisy one day result (including Sundays) may indicative trend like 7 day rolling average be. Herman who? Never heard guy. Probably liberal, he's black all. know else matters? Combating virus give damn ideals. guess that's mean. would argue worked terribly Australia go second harsh lockdown stay there. Lockdowns necessitate yo-yo lockdown cycle-- works while, restrictions lifted, cases go up, another lockdown needed. lockdown works temporarily, long term massive economic damage. 


The alternative article suggests-- protecting elderly letting young healthy roam free. long haulers exist, evidence permanent organ damage really thin. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* may even know infected symptoms tell nothing. Schrodeingers disease. 


But what? Fuck, stupid. I'm tired scientifically illiterate demanding ignorance respected. starters, whistleblowers like Bright must take retaliation complaints Merit Systems Protection Board get permanent relief retaliation. board lacked quorum entire Trump presidency hasn‚Äôt single member since early 2019, leaving whistleblowers unable effectively appeal preliminary decisions issued board‚Äôs lower-level administrative judges. board rendered functionally toothless, whistleblowers win initial case blocked agency appeals non-existent full board, leaving whistleblowers hanging bureaucratic limbo.

Are living Kafka story something like Catch-22? That‚Äôs going happen. made past every pandemic past without permanently changing behavior, one different. I‚Äôm you, there‚Äôs mistakes rushed medicines. See thalidomide babies ‚òπÔ∏è  They're database errors they're user errors Even universal healthcare. Boy dont get point. arguing bad faith, points don‚Äôt make sense me. 

Then ask clarification instead making unsupported declarations. List countries claim better. hard since already know ones China well certainly take I‚Äôm going go with.

Ok, why? metric basing others, lots countries (the UK, Ireland, etc.) implemented lockdown, test trace, also distribute PPE. countries clearly done nearly well others, that?

Those countries act early thoroughly like Japan, Korea, etc. didn‚Äôt implement lockdown test trace, PPE, etc. relatively low number cases.

That citizens started behaving correctly pandemic little need government force to. examples gave enforce PPE, distancing, shutdowns correctly.

Still waiting examples countries better examples gave claim. extra 5.7 months deaths within weeks. really good idea prevalence though. don‚Äôt think. likely targeted closing like bars restaurants. Encourage people work home make masks mandatory. Something. Like happen much owe 100 years deaths caused on-going Kansas Flu? much Europe owe people New World? 

Don‚Äôt even get started syphilis someone nameable personally spread decades. Europe, Canada something similar. subsidized payroll companies, cash unemployed. minks go extinct? vaccine work even animal reservoirs? living years, I‚Äôm gonna bet actual deaths easily 10x reported figure.

You would right disease one
 tracked way better. Delhi zero excess deaths even worst hit Mumbai twice declared deaths. talking $113 million fraudulent claims far. 0.02% $660 billion allocated PPP. Even consider full amount question House committee ($3 billion), still 0.5%. 

Can think government program 99.5% money went right cases involve $113 million loans‚Äîan eye-popping number consider number struggling small businesses shut program, ended August.

I also issue claim fraudsters effect businesses getting money. end May still money left (after 2nd funding round) net-lending turned negative. businesses repaying loans new loans awarded. program lapsed August $100 billion left unawarded.

Of course fraud bad investigated, program success important needs it. Cash rules everything around Sup Karen nEW nOrmAl! Gates Foundation contribute 50b endowment help? saying Swedes consider fact COVID got nursing homes thing special country reason total deaths several times worse neighbours. saying every country COVID get nursing homes excuse reason Sweden higher death toll. peers same. least it‚Äôs something common relate time period ends begin socializing rich must smart topic chooses. would argue worked terribly Australia go second harsh lockdown stay there.

Only Melbourne, government screwed. regions really experience second wave (except maybe Sydney evidence permanent organ damage really thin.

I've seen lots articles this. Also, 30% survivors pandemics (e.g. SARS MERS) permanent damage there's growing evidence Covid similar alternative article suggests-- protecting elderly letting young healthy roam free

Governments tried failed. cases initially rise younger populations end infecting elderly. Also, millions disability due long hauler symptoms. better economy?

Another thing consider leaving businesses open mean people going go. Sweden tried approach economy took huge hit, bad Nordic countries lock down. Sweden also significantly deaths. 

Personally think main issue reopenings governments refusing acknowledge existence aerosol transmission. places fine opened indoor dining, gyms, schools poorly ventilated places people take masks indoors. Protecting droplets fomites virus also spreads aerosols pretty pointless. already did. Please stop. Really. exactly happening. can't criticize CDC pushing people things like wipe groceries since can't even get us take even basic precautions like wearing mask properly go out, wish less downplaying risk involved. We're point people genuinely confuse ""This primary means virus spread"" ""The virus can't spread way"" Hopefully people conscientious masks underwear! It‚Äôs Oxford Pfizer. US Moderna Pfizer.

I‚Äôm sure blame FDA pausing trials considering lot questions two ‚Äúone 100k‚Äù events showed 20k people. could coincidence, FDA notoriously conservative health department planet. I‚Äôm sure US populace would stomach 30k adverse events even it‚Äôs technically much better solution compared hundreds thousands deaths. wear masks bit social distancing. would make big distance pretty much zero cost ? Seems like we‚Äôre similar 3 month schedule cringing needles haha Hopefully headaches, whatever you‚Äôre using Botox for, manageable you‚Äôre well! virus still living mask, could still inhale it. large problem. Like damaging keep students home 0 interaction NEXT fall. really think true across much West Latin America. People fed up, tired, annoyed, scared, angry above.

Young people seem bothered either way. go traveling, eating, meeting up. masks, without. Either way, result same: bothered.

Even people took seriously beginning starting say 'oh well, fuck it'. reason seems 'nothing works, rules weird arbitrary, enforcement inconsistent...why even bother'

It's kinda crazy much vicious cycle it. I'm starting wonder much cultural component plays role good/bad regions countries handling it. party ""believes science"" US (or really, anywhere)

Was encouraging mass gatherings months ago ""believing science""?

Was reopening CA cases rising?

More broadly, promoting ""green growth"" pumping chest pro-scientific anti-scientific side promoting ""non-green growth"" ""believing science""?

Etc. Yep. said lockdowns hurting us. Let's end craziness now. chemtrails coming soon! people Mayflower, 1/3 ""Pilgrims."" third hired crew, third paid passengers commercial investors expedition/colony. first winter killed them, latter survived greater proportion former. point nuanced failing pick up. Without responsible citizenry follow rules, lockdowns option.

No, point shifted, directly argued said possible implement test trace, PPE, etc. without virus entrenched across globe, option things get control hospitals overrun, lockdowns.

Why? We've come already lengthy lockdown cases part point. examples people right thing. UK not. lockdown necessary.

No, necessary, people told instead. Also, know, necessary problem *novel* virus. know correct measures are.

Except say people know Japan, Korea, etc. therefore lock prove rules.

Thailand New Zealand prove rule lockdowns necessary.

You also addressed point human rights. Hey, Idaho 1.8 million, already reported 660 daily cases. Thanks trying raise level discourse sub. Sorry getting downvoted troubles. Oh I'm saying best, agree approach same. Abstract

As world faces COVID-19, search effective treatments disease complications turned gaze drugs classically used infectious diseases. drugs examined recent evidence effects viral replication inflammation. aim study assess outcome Ivermectin-Azithromycin-Cholecalciferol combination therapy early stages (I-IIa) COVID-19 patients. proof concept study carried confirmed COVID-19 patients Mexico City, April 01 April 20, 2020. Patients met inclusion criteria invited take Ivermectin (6 mg daily day 0,1,7 8) plus Azithromycin (500 mg daily 4 days) plus Cholecalciferol (4000 UI twice daily 30 days). Treatment outcome evaluated 10th day onward first day drug intake. Recovery rate 28 patients received combination therapy 100%, mean symptomatic recovery duration 3.6 days negative PCR confirmed day 10. Imaging findings patients pneumonia improved day 10. Transient mild degree adverse effect like diarrhea nausea noted 3 (10.7%) patients. study found combination treatment might mitigate disease progression without significant adverse effects. studies needed order extrapolate findings moderate severe COVID-19.  Bright side, Biden wins covid rate flatten start decline! Actually therapeutics click notch top think modest changes.

I'm glad work professional conventions Thanks. didn‚Äôt difference. remember pulling asymptomatic cases months ago quarantining them. idea they‚Äôve found asymptomatic carriers spread disease less? Yea, foremost Covid expert, doubt. list reason, explain it.

I confused addressing [very real concerns acknowledged scientific/medical community think two views, way actually educated topic. Kain asked: ""Am brother's keeper?"" many suffer long-term side effects? think they've also careful spread fear food particular, could lead panic cause kinds problems. Really? country dense little healthcare per capita.

From living years, I‚Äôm gonna bet actual deaths easily 10x reported figure. still doesn‚Äôt answer question. Where‚Äôs outrage states? sub loses shit Florida it‚Äôs even top 10. Death impact. I‚Äôve got hEDS/dysautonomia mild POTS symptoms. passed out, once. It‚Äôs awful though. relate too, child prodigy everyone thought going places got Nerfed EBV resulting autoimmune disease (UCTD). body keeps trying kill can‚Äôt think straight. cognitive impact something that‚Äôs rarely considered there‚Äôs lot resources help it.

Sorry. Sad truth. Lockdown caused deaths due hunger unemployment Masks work wear them, limited extent. dine wearing fully functioning mask, keeping 2 distance next table, till worse eating home. risk stayed effect anyone else, would point. 

But doesn't, don't.

Saying anyone able want without follow rules laws designed protect others road anarchy. [archive link anyone trouble accessing article ""The government controls statistics"" usual answer get. There's use trying convince people. That‚Äôs sure. models actually work like Germany Korea example. Places, work, protect economy lives.

Bergamo 10% truth, 90% propaganda used sell lockdown narrative. going pub lockdown? Come dude misinformation. inside mouth susceptible virus. put something covered virus mouth infected. getting it! Basically lockdown name. removal comment explains reason. particular case, suggesting someone defeatist due learned helplessness hardly regarded civil. correct.

Every thread Gates people go ""lol he's virologist listen him"". quarantine x days take Sorry US Data.

If apply yours, 0.15%

*Mean ratio estimated infections reported case counts, Overall (range)= 11

China counts positive cases without symptom asymptomatic carriers, quarantine medical observation, symptoms turn out, r recgonized confirmed cases,. 


It's method China used peak medical system could hold many patient. cubic hospitals built asymptomatic mild cases.

and method runs till today.

 ppl would argue iMO OK, since China could mass tests find asymptomatic carriers, meanwhile countries test ppl r really sick.

Edit: far total number asymptomatic carriers (do turn confirmed cases) like thousand I'm wrong. 
Mostly found mass testing n contacted tracing.  TBH must ppl infected n recovered themselves, without knowing tested. 
That's  global common local Home Depot already took barriers removed arrows. grocery store. sabbath day \_is\_ blessing. get away without one one day realize much suffer. told younger-me, he'd downvote me. think general people point Peru Argentina examples failed. they'll call Sweden success without one. truth less black white. Peru strict lockdown lot issues social economic support. People go banks get stimulus money since e-banking. half people working fridge, forcing shop regularly. Sweden put hard cap 50 gatherings, essentially minimizing super spreader events. Certain places built effective lockdown. sliding scale measures many places trying find good balance.

Having said that, find epidemiologist says limiting contact within populace reduce spread virus found liar. Please stop explaining things. wrong know begin. Every country gets infections abroad returning citizens. quarantine quarantine perfect. That‚Äôs gets back in. also could never left. two weeks one two people asymptomatically spreads eventually redetected point shifted, first said lockdowns necessary. 

My point nuanced failing pick up. Without responsible citizenry follow rules, lockdowns option.

Now virus entrenched across globe, option things get control hospitals overrun, lockdowns. response like UK, people told behave correctly point, one day, lockdown imposed without prior warning.

Right, part point. examples people right thing. UK not. lockdown countries would‚Äôve done better citizens advised adopt certain measures locked down. 

That problem *novel* virus. know correct measures say China haven‚Äôt done well figures absolutely trusted. 

So arguing bad shape hiding tens thousands deaths millions infections leaving country open locking specific regions? numbers precise understand using targeted shutdowns keep rest country intrigued countries say best (with exception New Zealand) horrible human rights records. Timor-Leste imposed lockdown better every country listed.

Outliers prove rules. planet passing someone respiratory virus considered murder lmao No, keep borders closed tight vaccine herd immunity massive free vaccination programme. borders secure enough tiny number cases, less 1%, slip contact tracing methods already able contain without social distancing measures. government currently estimates borders stay closed early 2022. There's older study showed cloth face coverings increase risk bacterial illness particular bacteria grow absolutely need cleaned properly.

I believe played role public health agencies reluctance recommending cloth face coverings really trust general public use *properly*

I recommend situation can't properly wash cloth face coverings use, simply opt disposable options. unavailable beginning pandemic they're everywhere now. Welcome Science. Yeah, might well say lots additional deaths coming. I'm well read charter believe wait year vaccine... I'm glad Newsom's winery got stay open well. putting face right box Froot Loops huffing in

For seeming idea ""post COVID"" world would look like we'd literally different species. 

Humans gathering groups get drunk watch things since caveman first ate fermented fruit tree. 

The article also editorializes quotes quite bit. Nowhere interviewee say ""we able go bars concerts indoor venues forever ever"". point going night day switch path lives back pandemic gradual. wipe everything comes home fuck knows point. fucking hate thing. Even I'm wearing undies hours I'm washing wearing again. That‚Äôs great hear, takes effort keep leave on.  Damn. Thats evil. mean get people dont typically value prisoners, one though, sane, moral people know would also appalled purely greed driven action. Inmates people too, like people lives hold value.

The point is, allow tens thousands protest, allow church service. have. papers around list decay time virus populations materials like plastic, paper, fabric, different metals (silver copper kill quickly), etc.

Slowest noted decay time papers seen order day... course like ""kills 99.9% bacteria"" stuff - start billions viruses half amount quite times still non-zero amounts left. sounds like actually skeptics making fun pro-lockdown stereotypes (kind like CoronavirusCirclejerk), rather genuine proponents extreme mitigation measures. graph leaves black line turn sharply due seasonality. Unless red line quickly changes well seem correct analysis. Interesting people really, really dislike comment lol absolutely support restaurants ordering take delivery.

Again, restaurants would still critical part infrastructure total shut due logistical hurdles putting grocery stores meant restaurants seas food plants.

Not sure think buying meal picking benefit restaurant unless eat there. clarify this? makes zero sense. Please don‚Äôt copy paste comments do! Genuinely!

The example would use set roadway speed limits 1 MPH. Hooray! accident fatalities! Right?

Well, quite. problem becomes roadway becomes unusable. 1 MPH speed limit definitely reduce traffic fatalities, expense driving friends, driving visit relative lives little away, going airport. businesses outside densely populated suburbs cities suffer ‚Äî hey, aren‚Äôt facing traffic fatalities, right?

I‚Äôm part crowd denies COVID serious potentially lethal. support lockdowns, applied judiciously intelligently avoid overly restricting people‚Äôs movement and, practically, willingness comply. every part life, weigh potential negative consequences action negative consequences it. Traffic deaths vs. seeing people. rock climbing vs. climber deaths. don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs even unbelievable say diseases. 

If you‚Äôre enjoying life COVID, power you. think you‚Äôd small, small minority. don‚Äôt especially like wearing mask, though I‚Äôm happy preserve vulnerable community. want go Broadway show support gifted actors job foreseeable future. want favorite musicians play concerts live, Internet. want go club party able see people‚Äôs faces. I‚Äôd like hug grandparents. 

The point things think make life worth things entail amount risk. COVID, risk high enough warrant precautions we‚Äôre taking now. something like seasonal flu common cold? Well, I‚Äôm willing take risk now, young person. get older, maintain ‚Äî risk would run older adult flu would far, far outweighed able see children grandchildren enjoying life without restriction. (And doesn‚Äôt mean nothing, either! Maybe children flu, don‚Äôt come visit nursing home. take measured risk without blanket restrictions everyday life.)

You don‚Äôt agree ‚Äî clearly opinion isn‚Äôt popular one subreddit ‚Äî wanted lay another way thinking beyond seems dominant one here. consider whether you‚Äôre totally internally consistent. highway accidents, remember drivers ed correctly, occur lane changes.

Invermectin recall prevents virus able replicate infected cell, Azithromycin inhibits infecting cells first place. Also Doxycycline thing, royally tears stomach. could get life. Like modern life issues, situation complex vague, unfortunately. Neither lockdowns Barrington pipe dream good answers pandemic. Many People stopped drunk driving strict laws steep fines. even then, remains many scofflaws.  
We need Mothers Anti-Maskers Type movement . Given teachers died it‚Äôs probably good. Safety. think does. money went large corporations retired parents tote groceries' 7 days dry goods and/or wipe everything down. may matter trying stack much statistic's favor possible.  isn‚Äôt change countries doing. USA certainly hasn‚Äôt lockdown outside NY Initially. Hahahahahaha understand actually get virus particles inside nostrils get sick, 3 true time

Bottom line, don‚Äôt pick nose

^(Edited grammar) It‚Äôs schools it‚Äôs private organizations. School hockey hasn‚Äôt started yet. comparison,  anybody know many died UT drunk driving day? major breech quarantine procedures returning citizens. know major driver infection face face human contact. 
The story easy find yet evey one obsessed frozen food thing. 
Which requires prefect chain events cause infection basically impossible. 
Viruses agency. way move way repair themselves. rely blind luck make way one host another. mean, none recommendation anyone. saying still wanna make sure levels stay going Nope. Spoken like someone truly doesn‚Äôt know single thing natural selection. Try educating yourself: rubbing face. whole lot things would sit on, would rub lips breathing open mouth.


Or treat mouth anus same? Essential, like Socialization, freedom speech, etc. Things Humans need. Common decency supporting restaurants facing bankruptcy thanks selfish people like yourself. viable virus isolated 28 days 20 ¬∞C common surfaces

Meanwhile, migrant farm laborers [...] began fall ill rate 11 times health workers

US CDC risk getting sick COVID-19 eating handling food (including frozen food produce) food packages considered low.

Yeah, right. really see farm workers sanitising hands wearing masks.

From data, must form hypothesis one worker runny nose bad habits infect hundreds people.
Real-world saliva measurements food exact minimum inoculum estimations might change view.
Unfortunately, one testing this. I'm boat. start, cautious could took proper procedures. suddenly hopped conspiracy train nearly month ago. 

Now nothing anti-mask ignorance calling hoax. ""ThE vIrUs WaY sMaLlEr MaSk,"" well beautiful ""tHaT mAsK sToP BiO-wEaPoN!"" power shut things down/make nationwide mask mandates.

Well, that's true all. Look federal speed limits got enacted country. would liked seen done differently? soothing words?

Oh god, many things. chose one, would president politicizing mask-wearing. choose another, would blocking states getting PPE. jeeze, he's done many things wrong, hard decide! Like what? none United States, home slave, land obsignorantly ignorant...  prefer needles end day whatever gets reliable effective vaccine fastest. everyone could take drugs, wouldn‚Äôt overdoses. everyone STD got tested used condom, wouldn‚Äôt STDs. It‚Äôs perfect sure absolutely lower spread. Instead criticizing suggestion? Imagine thinking ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt let control you‚Äù exact thing ‚ÄúIgnore Get life.

I would lockdowns making tricky. Population 45M; 25K tests per day; testing focuses contacts known infected tests. One group today, another tomorrow,.. unable make point honestly, continue care yourself.

That shameful. hoping find first hand foolish ignore risk management common decency. Chiming in. Originally, came drugs basically handicapped couple years. relearn basic skills, walking difficult. slowly recovered got COVID March (NYC). Since then, good days bad mental acuity daily headaches. work past month so. started taking NAD+ whim it‚Äôs really helped stay focused energized retain information. There‚Äôs literally science says it‚Äôs possible contain using basic measures. It‚Äôs never done history virus widespread COVID-19, you‚Äôve said technically misinformation.

 measures theory could it, don‚Äôt think due lack public compliance. Either way, measures would require enormous sacrifice hardship society, point it‚Äôs longer scientific concern, people decide. People outside contact deliveries mail? You‚Äôd probably see lot even distribution cases whereas mainly see flair states countries aren‚Äôt adhering social distancing mask usage gets knocked pretty quickly do. Contact tracing. Stuff like that. COULD happening bit certainly doesn‚Äôt seem likely wide scale even close. rich country would stupid one. China's mass testing response extensive tracing post positive cases, randomly sampling huge amount localities vastly cheaper virus run amok. Fauci summed well. Sweden much higher death per capita rate relative neighboring countries. 

Consistency isn‚Äôt everything. confine virus smaller groups. meet people know private strangers. Presidents power shut things down/make nationwide mask mandates.

What would liked seen done differently? soothing words? disbelief science valid opinion, destructive, willful ignorance. understand schools would let happen. sports important kids health? Duh Viruses known trigger autoimmune disorders predisposed individuals. college mono got swine flu semester. sleep disorder similar narcolepsy mental physical side effects severe sleep deprivation.

That may what's going case, we're gonna seeing longterm‚Äîoften lifelong‚Äîeffects covid years come. prepared huge spikes things like narcolepsy, lupus, type 1 diabetes, rhumatoid arthritis. virus going alter course many lives. I'll go restaurant instead. fun staying home. downvote brigade people criticize brigading is, American right wing political agenda, months. Although, appreciate reinforcing ignorance irrationality opinion again, failing address cited argument simply commenting baseless snark. often turns around Americans go sleep, gives us good idea reason downvotes. swarm secret lurker scientists US time zones voting rationality evidence. **are** irrational side. There's large propaganda machine disinformation pushing side well. come combinations? throwing kitchen sink see works? targeted? mean, people keep arguing this. Also, press this, never admit would economic damage global pandemic without lockdowns. 

It's crazy. Idk why, there's inhaled version insulin insurance cover. Seems like brainer especially childhood diabetes. think called Afrezza. key word ""essential"". Id pick America cause live America Lockdowns work. Again? Cmon Bill *Loving* downvotes this...that indicative shift opinion sub (not mention rational discussion lockdowns above). 2800 cases day 90 deaths still much gonna everything open restrictions ANYTHING South Africa, mortality rate decreased covid deaths offset decrease people *being murdered*. never said was.

Try bad faith straw man. reminded go facebook get screenshots people delete posts 3 months now. Maybe he's President Trump using alternate reddit profile. US going tied political bullshit long time, vaccine quite time. ""Politics influence vaccine"". BULL-FUCKING-SHIT! Another study yet shows something concocted fight malarial parasite absolutely ability fight respiratory virus. Well, people would died anyway, count

 \- Republicans   LoTR tours rest world Notice adjusted U.S. population, many EU countries‚Äô pandemic unemployment plans would cost us $250 billion per year.

We passed $2 trillion plan ran money months. It‚Äôs government inherently wasteful inefficient. It‚Äôs we‚Äôve elected bunch crooked sociopaths gave $2 trillion companies instead people, told people risk exposure virus starve. case fatality hasn‚Äôt really dropped much though recent months

So yes initial wave likely higher recorded, probably widespread lot people like believe And... change mind Biden wins November/December SUPER bad virus. 

It's looking like bad fall/winter, btw. First off, Twitter, study. 

Second, even read tested neck gaiters conventional methods, pleased see perform similarly cloth masks well doubled over.

Also, DAMN! Look effective say gaiters be. Uh... one arguing mask handwashing distancing. thread lockdowns, kill small businesses. Open everything safety procedures place. 28 days later...... medical doctor myself, take:
an counter drug available world, US, helps thin mucous, apparently promise inhibit COVID-19 entry.

More Projection refugee caravan? countries like India going struggle matter due poverty population density.

Some countries like United Kingdom America piss poor government response resulted enormous number deaths.

Could United States eliminated it? Unlikely considering states decentralised design central government, porous border south.

Could United States cohesive strategy plan place reduce movement, transmission, improve contact tracing, PPE testing?

Hell yes could. response simply piss poor compared almost every western nation. sounds like knew meant family believes BS won‚Äôt listen even facts evidence saying YES, take Covid seriously, NO, Trump good job handling shitshow all...*sigh* It‚Äôs fun one family knows what‚Äôs actually going on. gonna lie here, times folks made want scream. 2.00 IQ fuck isn't. throw away two years life someone gets months can‚Äôt see restrictions?  don‚Äôt believe imprisoning people houses don‚Äôt believe either wrong actually smart guy. 

I love pointing hypocrisy what‚Äôs allowed what‚Äôs not. similar situation 40+ years. FWIW, slowing seems help me. brains operate much quicker speed bodies respond. Jeez covid f*cking everything even minks Ok here‚Äôs cookie üç™ Well luckily people care others that‚Äôs going happen. government keep trying improve life people. Selfish people like bit sad bit longer. Boohoo Nope, opportunity long passed countries. need start implementing measures like fines would compel people follow mask mandates social distancing guidelines. Clearly recommendations alone seem working. Exactly. us ""proper"" safety protocols becoming lenient many people becoming burnt pandemic. 

I mean us still are, ridiculous. [This](http://imgur.com/gallery/cFLuzRA) compares several SA countries today. Argentina worsening quite time.   thinking malaria work I‚Äôm going assume you‚Äôve never experienced depression you?  post comment removed 

Sorry opinion pieces please. 

([More believe made mistake, please [message moderators](/message/compose?to=/r/Coronavirus).* Getting old sucks. look Sweden ndver lock, lockdowns now, masks worn.
they herd immunity winter, wash scarf toque every time wear them. 

I need wear mask minutes run groceries. get sweaty, hang use days later. I've washing hand couple uses. strings fraying think well machine. families whoever owns pubs can't Let live life. I'm done this. Anyone wants isolate free so. not. care either way. anymore. know tell people anymore, honestly. Everyone around lax whole thing, even close family members. Friends mine got together birthday party. go I'm sure look like ""that person"" group. put mine soapy water microwave high 2-3 minutes - per recommendations sterilizing kitchen sponges. example - comes Republicans

In America least lack lockdown Gonna cancel vote ya. Typical, hypocritical idiot dad eats restaurants twice day work week. He's also aok.

Are masks unnecessary too? issue appropriate risk mitigation successful, going look like overreaction.

Well said. trying summarize nailed it. take vaccines every month years.

It honestly depends nurse familiarity you. first times always hurt gets spot generally feel anymore. fairness, polio vaccination campaign extremely costly also caused many cases vaccine induced polio. ultimately achieve eradication, worth it... haven‚Äôt achieved yet, doesn‚Äôt look like situation getting better Afghanistan Pakistan.

Humans successfully eradicated one virus past (smallpox), would foolish imagine Covid eradicated time soon.

Given that, better figure live virus soon, since world poverty likely double year 2020 alone. problem comments ""COVID problem kills/cripples people, wear masks social distance dine indoors save lives"" based articles research scientific sources, comments ""COVID kills old people hanging indoors people care essential human activity"" sources based selfishness, ignore fact they're 20 fit, there's reasonable high risk many them. Many people second group affected since joined first group (and posted heartfelt video facebook explaining wrong deny pandemic). first group usually find sources ask one (though many may ask use google pretty easy to), adjusted way behave new information comes out. second group sources based science fact, speculation economy best back arguments. I'm saying anyone's right everything, there's one group leans heavily fact one leans heavily feelings propaganda. It‚Äôs terrible advice.

People need staying home. Indoor dining, haircuts, etc. essential survival, yet people continue partake activities.

I wish wasn‚Äôt case, COVID-19 absolutely dominating people‚Äôs lives right now. remember quote long ago first started, ""its matter matter catch it"". Happy Cake Day! contracting coronavirus March, Michael Reagan lost memory 12-day vacation Paris, even though trip weeks earlier.

Several weeks Erica Taylor recovered COVID-19 symptoms nausea cough, became confused forgetful, failing even recognize car, Toyota Prius apartment complex‚Äôs parking lot.

‚ÄúIt scares think I‚Äôm working,‚Äù Mizelle, 53, said. ‚ÄúI feel like dementia.‚Äù asking give freedom speech? true freedom gather way curbed varying extents different places curb political freedoms, health reasons. Notice peaceful BLM marches (not talking riots) generally allowed unhindered authorities, political right freedom assembly. freedom go packed pubs buddies middle pandemic, much ""essential"" freedom.

Anyway, little research, quote context mean think anyway.

[So start matters, Franklin writing subject asked cede liberty government, capacity legislator asked renounce power tax lands notionally jurisdiction. words, ‚Äúessential liberty‚Äù Franklin referred thus would think today civil liberties but, rather, right self-governance legislature interests collective watch clips presented Majority Report, even hard stomach. It‚Äôs becoming known COVID brain fog: troubling cognitive symptoms include memory loss, confusion, difficulty focusing, dizziness grasping everyday words. Increasingly, COVID survivors say brain fog impairing ability work function normally. Thank you! cherry picked single data point misrepresent data.

Again, link, researcher says gaiters trying say worse tested neck gaiters conventional methods, pleased see perform similarly cloth masks well doubled over.

Saying worse mask wildly incorrect statement link proves.

You really bad this. sad think acceptable lie mislead people get upset someone points blatantly incorrect things saying. roughly 275,000 dead counting? Fucking hell, way, like, idk, wearing masks, social distancing, actually government programs make needed PPE vaccines providing money people work, prevent/ lower amount [Looks like it'll ready go Thanksgiving (Fauci stated Germany ICUs per capita country maybe able stay little bit ahead compared neighbors that? 

Somebody downvoted that, accurate. I'll repost fix users stupidity. could care less karma, can't morons downvoting good data. Thankfully, scientists research, rather guessing speculating. 

Research slow process.

Research informative rarely definitive.

As research develops understanding changes, best answers guidance change. Details treat high blood pressure change. Blood pressure studied for... long time. vital sign measured truly countless times. understanding still developing. 

Science patient defers evidence. 

Anyone expecting looking black white, conclusive answers NEVER change misunderstanding scientific process. almost miracle know much virus now. Progress vaccine never gone even remotely fast, example.

In short, UNCERTAINTY always part process. messiness scientific investigation part think important defer expert groups, like medical organizations. Interpreting science rarely straight forward. million voices makes seem like best answer, case Honestly feel hate nasal ANYTHING 20x needles. 

I got four glucose tests current pregnancy (21 weeks due weight 30ish due changing doctors normal time frame) swear god amount needles. 

I get stuck TWICE new doctor nurse get blood, three days later went adjacent hospital stuck twice got blood second time. 

I failed 1 hr test, went back three hour test gotta get stuck 4 times (fasting, 1 hr post drink, 2 hr, 3rd hr.) 

Failed get prick 4 times day take blood sugar. 

Then got flu TDAP shot (Which latter burns like hell)

Positive: fear needles next none now. 
Negative: fucking needles   many white house? Also death Fairness Doctrine early 80s. Reagan, news stations present opposing viewpoints. went left right wing biases. Now, spend entire day watching Fox get Limbaugh Alex Jones type content. opposing viewpoints dissenting voices need apply. never gone S. Korea. S. Korea suffered huge spike cases since anti-government rallies Aug. 15. None makes sense. Bill Gates get micro chip inside take vaccine nasally? According health minister. People getting mass infected public transportation. mostly events, partying private celebrations slaughterhouses course. serious comment mocking Americans think country world suffers Europe utopia? Yup dad‚Äôs way. read title post said ‚Äúhow many motorcycle accidents?‚Äù Canada 254 deaths per million (83k adjusted US), doubt could well unhealthier population mediocre medical system. I‚Äôd say 100k absolute minimum.  long history punishing sacrificing whistle blowers, even laws place protect them. find hypocritical us take countries task it.

These people literally trying bring light corruption inefficiency system fix it, punish instead. true all. almost passed every gardasil shot. hurt bad. nurses keep lying 20 minutes make sure pass way home. Uh, I'm pretty sure would get vaccine distributed regardless Trump pouting, lol. person solely charge vaccine distribution AFAIK. covid deaths. Meh....

Look recent surge cases countries much stricter lockdowns earlier like France, Germany, Spain.

In end, aren‚Äôt achieving anything better did. highly recommend watch 60 Days In. Maybe follow 13th find got like that. needs repercussions. Fox OAN flat lies. 7/15 episode Ingram Angle doctor show said masks work coronavirus fecal/oral spread disease. point 130,000 dead Americans. I'm free speech guise news actual lies mislead people taking wrong actions dying. 36% higher officially stated...jesus christ. way research done solid. needs published every front page. Systemic racism 20th century: gift keeps giving. Flanders wonderful. stranger cafe take day drive around tour.

I learned quickly stay away dairy farmers. people symptoms: feel light headed / woozy / generally it? feels like weird body experience, moments feel like I‚Äôm going pass out. 

Also, haven‚Äôt cough/difficulty breathing yet (it‚Äôs 3 days since symptoms developed). brace develop soon? I‚Äôve bad sore throat, nausea, mentioned above, luckily nothing severe. Admittedly, analogy isn‚Äôt ideal, interesting parallel respects. Personally would say right, 280k would dead people alive due avoiding ""normal"" deaths... professional life would need studies done I'd willing say clients (health life insurance companies). See want info...

When looking excess deaths best realize year extremely different anything seen recent history. Mortality factors increased decreased it. examples (not all) are:

Decreasing Factors:

* Decrease ""normal"" deaths accidents
* Decrease deaths infectious diseases
* Decrease homicide
* Shockingly saw decrease heart attacks study early May... sure still holds though.

Increasing Factors:

* COVID-19
* Forgoing normal preventative care
* Psychological causes

Therefore lock without COVID-19 rampaging us, may seen decrease mortality 2020, hard quantify bullets ""Decreasing Factors"" compare bullets ""Increasing Factors"" labeled COVID-19.

Hopefully makes sense! pretty obvious. send kids school three cloth masks everyday, switch new one lunch snack time put old ones plastic bag. get home masks immediately get bowl hot soapy water soak washed hand. know damp gross things get figure there‚Äôs less chance getting exposed virus caught mask. seem idealogically driven commenter, please consider what's actually happening. poster nonewnormal troll. go back old accounts, even delete lockdownskeptic posts. He's strawman people attack provide platform actual skeptic misinformation spread responses. enable commenters post circlejerk comments like one responding to. thing misinformation campaign meant change opinion. Downvote move on. game. numbers mentioned still correct. Stop trying win isn‚Äôt debate. Trump wins, rush vaccine, left fight him/the vaccines every step way. election way, pretend gives shit anymore. He'll push ""Covid ain't shit, know experience"" narrative.

If Biden wins, nothing happen vaccine takes office January. Trump pout essentially president 2 months.

Either way, things going look good country quite awhile, Covid-Wise. prepared miserable, shitty winter.  exactly talking though ?
Misinformation ?
Plenty where‚Äôs true information told survivors ?

Are saying survivors Covid aren‚Äôt reddit users ?

I would think thousands recovered would love hear , felt advice still dark ? Well, US #1 infected country world, surely helps somewhere, right? It‚Äôs pretty much mandatory here. stores allow unmasked people inside. inside though? Mask enforcement pretty much non-existent. people keep masks place always pull masks nose. can‚Äôt blame store staff wanting added burden baby idiots can‚Äôt keep mask place, wish managers would handle task. It‚Äôs better dying, grow fuck No, whataboutism. people socially isolating 7 months??  ""then got sick"". kind sickness? mono? remember predicted going 100,000 US covid deaths August. October started US covid deaths since doubled since August span even 2 months. Thats going freak conspiracy theorists out. They're going say spraying nano bots shit. vaccines make freaking frogs gay Hello fellow anxious person! want able advocate us too! Lawsuit media seriously needs happen soon. Also happens genius, there's that. fuck going there? even running 15k tests *in entire country*. would like make sarcastic joke Trump relative Argentine government, there's nothing funny this. They're clearly outbreak something, things, fucked numbers like that. double amount people hospitalized right number tests ran! Poor people drive.

Rich people fly.

Make sense now? Surprisingly, traffic fatalities true lockdown months What's thing lol testing get weird results. people still test positive months PCR tests even detect leftover dead DNA fragments. could positive symptoms start. Also people tend say had/have symptoms really push memory, they'll admit slight sore throat so. study also done Mai/June likely younger people it, current spread started young people slowly went August/September older generations. 

Positive also mean contagious. oh yeah. get that. want something mean over. that's mentality lot people lot things. 

the issue appropriate risk mitigation successful, going look like overreaction. mean stop, though. analogy like make people quit taking medicine supposed chronic condition feel normal now.... get it, that's works, yo. someone immunocompromised cannot live vaccines, thought well. 

Bring needle! deaths paint much better picture gravity virus, moment, they're MUCH lower before: trying change said? said cases, deaths. 

And yes, deaths lower understood virus less. Death negative outcome though. Especially hospitals end overrun UK, told detrimental wear them.

Then talking WHO? feel like flailing here. Start posting sources much disprove you.

It rude keep insisting one thing pretend really meant something else every time proven many countries overrun hospitals implement lockdowns. Sweden's hospitals overrun.

Ok, change reality said. Again, outliers make rules. ever rigorous science statistics class? feel like either understand basics ore continuing act bad saying pointless.

No, clearly stated two months lockdown everything would go back same. Again, say mean instead trying retcon everything clear right protest / freedom assembly gone UK since gatherings 6 illegal.

Ok, relate bringing countries. Thailand experiencing huge protests right now.

Had everyone shut properly reopened properly, could like them. But.... wow misleading headline Title slightly misleading. comparing 2020 vs average last 5 years 2020vs highest last 5 years. I'm guessing compared highest last 5 would still comfortably 200,000 excess deaths. skeptic troll brigading. He's strawman people attack provide platform actual skeptic misinformation spread responses. thing misinformation campaign meant change opinion. entirely different psyop. mean government decided industries essential employees suppose conduct themselves... maybe try learning factual information instead listening fake news. Excuse misspelled fox ‚Äúnews‚Äù. every AMERICAN April . I'd agree given humans , all, pretty primitive animals care anything else saving asses but, let tell you, America country world

Even America highly doubt every state every county get vaccine April , literally, world get April

Said that, pretty much screwed anyways global vaccine 2021 because, one, rest countries still struggling covid help restore economic chains and, two, virus mutate among population manage infect unless globally eradicated Word salad? False equivalency?

Is Ben Shapiro?  Yes, George Washington important figure people Netherlands. state city... explain what's wrong it? KFN4 mask? Nope. Nice try. actually seems really smart. actually said hospitals get paid covid deaths.

They don't. believe everything mom feeds you. 

If person situation describe, would no-brainer become whistleblower receive 25% Medicare COVID treatment funds fraudulently paid hospital. Easy case win. additional funding COVID19 death, funding COVID19 treatment. patient treated COVID19, though, additional funds paid. countries COVID deaths, especially Asia. hint even considered. Instead, another brag-job Kiwis. Tara Reade consider COVID-19 new real study like this? read article posted response, says even reliable hard data recently. expect someone produce evidence want exist? I'd much rather ""We attacking thiss head on"" train like China ""It's real, let walk hospital superman logo shirt "" train Well know cloth masks bad job defending wearer anyways. 


Not saying important issue, unless studying transmission others (which suspect masks reduce 90%), whole article kind pointless. China: administers 9 million tests drop hat see measly 12 confirmed cases. 

USA: 60,000 cases day, 2000ish dying day, essential workers bend backwards find place testing get test done, wait 5 days results. 

US Citizens: ""But China lied! numbers fake!"" government taking financial risk corporations. won‚Äôt making money vaccines. anything, corporation would better vaccine fail administer still got full funding vaccine. 

All trials reports standardized across public, private, government research. single largest global cooperation event date. 

A single corporation won‚Äôt able fudge data distribute bogus vaccine. won‚Äôt able charge crazy amount. 

This bragging rights gets done right first. coworkers same. think people Covid really dying comorbidities happen Covid. really understand logic though. think every disease compromises immune system? ""We could theoretically different response people would died Covid fewer causes.""

Yes. That's point. metric care steps taken responses reasons why. ""How many people died COVID"". Anything else adding commentary opinion blame. nice know actual death toll is. consider COVID-19 new real study like this? read article says even reliable hard data recently. expect someone produce evidence want exist? Cant make similar argument anything inherent risk, like driving car. people decent healthcare routinely saw doctors wellness visits... anyone get infuriated people discard masks gloves ground lazy put dumpster? seen reusable masks non-reusable masks gloves laying tempted throw might infested could get sick. 

I likely Karen everyone wants nagged 24/7 idiot mind business and. me, share personal story healthy 35 year-old got flu. big deal, right? well, infected heart (myocarditis) ended heart attack. went hospital and, even though felt completely fine whole time, kept heart monitor three days concerned might die. ~40% heart function.

to reinforce fact healthy 35 year-old, cardiologist told would take 6 months heart heal. echocardiagram 2 months later heart looked perfectly healthy, never sick. 

if died death certificate would listed two causes - flu myocarditis. myocarditis directly caused flu, single heart problem either since. yet 6%ers would tell that, hypothetical instead died, die flu death certificate would listed flu.

sure, 90 year-olds Covid-19 death count going die next couple years anyway. lot people who, without pneumonia myocarditis *caused Covid*, would still alive today. 6% number ignores them, lung/heart problems drectly caused Covid. possible, test patients ICU? idea simple enough. Say 1000 people test, expect low positive rate. ""pool"" samples 100 groups 10, run 100 tests. Maybe 2 pooled tests come back positive. go individually test 20 samples pools. instead 1000 tests, 120. Yes. NEVER come exact ""covid (direcly) related deaths"". also longer term deaths due minor surgeries (not done, early) cancers caught due elective surgeries stopped due fears even go hospital. argument taking extreme measure immediately best response.

And that's talking deaths, wellness.

Edit: sorry, response bit mess. honestly cannot correct it, fantasy football drove many (drinks) evening. Wtf talking about? said anything Spanish flu? Everyone talking seasonal flu. told month less 1000 people died country covid One might take time step back ponder economies collapse people‚Äôs lives ruined suppression unnecessary arms economy. People can‚Äôt eat yet farms doubt change bounty. People lose homes yet there‚Äôs fundamental change real estate construction. unnecessary exploitation people hinging livelihoods rears it‚Äôs ugly head face disaster. Nope, VN TW happens take swab samples X number people, mix together PCR test mix. positive re-test individual find positive, negative negative.

So clearly greatly save number test need run cover population batches come back negative. There's whole complicated mathematical model figure ideal number people per batch based think positive rate could be.

The greater positive rate population less effective method testing need reduce size batch. point becomes entirely worthless positive rate high enough.

During Dalian outbreak batch size 3 people, quite conservative. hear time Qingdao batches somewhere 8-10 much aggressive, China probably quite reasonable. legitimately believe news came disease disproportionately affecting black brown communities, people really bought hoaxes shit. Also political anything help people evaporated quickly. think questions snarky comments. 

Did consider COVID-19 new real study like this? read article twice says even reliable hard data recently. expect someone produce evidence want exist? said, probably lung/heart failure reported covid dead home die en route, least die tested. secondary deaths least it. That‚Äôs almost 300,000 people... holy fuck. work? Bunch scientists there? I'm taking account age etc etc.... Also saying use idiots think death rates low give false ones...it fits scenarios...but yeah disgusting people taken seriously  spouse? ask wife takes similar measures you, hate see struggle much anxiety. also tough relationship. Spanish flu killed 60 million world population 1.8 billion.

Proportionately, lethal Spanish Flu, virus would kill least 210 million people today. Instead, around 0.9 million people died far. Compare **60 million** ordinarily die year.

Also understand comorbities refer to: pre-existing conditions, result COVID-19. Unfortunately majority people know like work major hospitals LA, SF, SD... mainly nurses spreading info around.

Because hospitals colleagues hospitals don‚Äôt many cases see death extremely old ill It‚Äôs funny people right turn weird ‚Äúmasturbating politics‚Äù imagery every conversation...

Really underscores whole movement really bunch poorly adjusted troglodytes, lashing using Python lurking message boards trying ‚Äúswing Overton window‚Äù parents‚Äô basements. work TV station used report numbers every day Trump's administration took numbers. look someone living lung cancer gets covid-19 dies say died lung cancer. makes feel like (and everyone else) perfectly fine long pre-existing conditions, clearly virus dangerous safely go back normal. literally keeping covid-19's numbers lower makes Dear Leader look better, though fairness think people actively think exact terms. \^\^\^ hilarious projection comments Vitamin posts filled people saying ""I take 8000 IU day doctor says levels still low."" link provided showed doses high actually cause serious problems people. think issue anyone monitored doctors, buying high dose bottle bad idea.

I'm suggesting people familiar supplements start general multi. really surprising benign comment provoked angry comments downvotes. It‚Äôs going disappear literal day election. get back January let know people still worried it. mean, crazies Reddit like probably be, I‚Äôm talking real life. do. Thank goodness. random sharp chest pains there, overall, think okay. feel like happened years depression. Yea it‚Äôs something never realized pandemic. I‚Äôm stats guy, love them, truly understand relevance unimportance times. What‚Äôs frustrating find terrible stats deaths overall regarding timeliness. yea manipulation numbers outside influence, like don‚Äôt test aren‚Äôt cases, horrible. can‚Äôt really talk deaths compare historical numbers. Drastic changes large stats cannot dismissed coincidence usually. current numbers, even potential under-reporting way higher coincidence would account understanding. here. work county probably 85% Pro Trump, nothing enforced. job puts public, mask everywhere go, nobody else does. believe impossible get test unless showed ambulance barely breathing. Worst ""flu"" life. Recovered, couple months later longer ride mountain bike, barely lap around neighborhood walking, finally got referred cardiologist turns Doctor thing real either. Kept complaining mild chest aches....oh probably rib place, let refer Chiropractor. Wtf man. sure life ever health wise, that's hard pill swallow someone active entire life. Thankful alive, get wrong. man...it way. want point study seems actually provide folks ammo mentions excess deaths COVID related due fear hospitals, layoffs, depression, etc.  Thank you. second time getting COVID. 

I COVID November 2019 September 2020. ‚òπÔ∏è

I hope bounce back. definitely try slow down.  smart mass testing. retest positives. How‚Äôs koolaid taste bud?

Edit: funny every conservative thinks everyone *else* crazy, sipping insanity juice come surprise Trump lied. MO. policy ever implemented payments uninsured fallen flat. See liberal school. AOC went there. need publish one BC. everybody doubt Catholic. Catholics continue doubt themselves, eventually, years later find terms centuries self-doubt lead reversion Judaism true guilt, Jewish guilt. mean? seems like testing 9 million residents. point people died Covid response Covid. 

We could theoretically different response people would died Covid fewer causes. INTERNET!!! They're going report says 6% COVID related death certificates COVID listed cause death. 

What probably meant 6% death certificates incomplete.  expect western media go crazy news tomorrow.

Number Chinese covid cases increases 400% overnight. CCP verge collapse. Whoa I‚Äôve never actually seen anyone use ‚Äúlose religion‚Äù sentence way Michael Stipe got from. Nice!

Just leave jovial irrelevant comment bounce back plague Isn‚Äôt Canada one closes border US? Thus shouldn‚Äôt question doesn‚Äôt Canada let citizens drive US lets fly? Damn. perfect comment governments world hurt economies tens thousands people die hate trump?

yes, theory. learnt Korea.  biggest city world 146 new cases unbelievable wear mask people never explain mean this. think Trump winning, theory here? Trump wins Democrats give world domination plan next day? ""no bullshit"" flags. What, Trump wins sudden people making bullshit (democrats minds again) disappear?

or... believe Trump wins reelection going take democrats back shoot them. Finally ending bad thing causes bad things country, good? WTF THINK HAPPEN!!! also say oxygen molecules CO2 cannot pass mask. assumptions wrong, even refuse accept that, can't true. supply demand fault regardless though.

same goes animal leather gucci, prada, channel etc etc surprising. actual death toll never known. estimated death toll take years determine. sure you‚Äôre getting at. I‚Äôm talking first wave March/April. We‚Äôve solid amount testing since then, likely big changes that. Op talking NY. I've never heard anyone acknowledge virus December. reason common response average person *doesn‚Äôt* know someone who‚Äôs died virus, statistically. Rounding up, 0.1% population died. average person ‚Äúknows‚Äù 600 people. odds 600 survived .999^600 = 55%. guys Circle-Jerking 200k Americans dead. guys hate America want gone. Sorry right, forgot change TLDR. number body update correct. 0 new domestic confirmed cases 3 new domestic asymptomatic carriers.

6 domestic confirmed cases 6 asymptomatic carriers found today, expect western media go crazy news tomorrow.

Anyway I've fixed TLDR give fuck logic. They'll claim high motivations, listen facts, want team win. boil fucking blood. honestly shitty excuse. much chance catching public work. Maybe 6% comorbidities. overblown, worse Asian Flu killed 1.1 left wing think tank trying make massive pandemic order hurt Trump's chances reelection. sadly disappointed come 11/3.

Average age death 75, 94% comorbities. people still pay cash days inconsiderate assholes anyway.

There may access plastic, US, small minority. never said were. get level people know better tempt it. Seasonal deaths flu respitatory illnesses around 50k per year. suggest go back school relearn basic maths. figured drastically higher average deaths pneumonia we've seeing attributed Covid. think things like increased drug overdose deaths attributed change lifestyle covid. Chinese testing batches, e.g. 5-10 people tested one person. America, testing one person time. Thank you. going straight mother. I'm tired saying doctors making numbers get money. godamn trump killed almsot millionm people covid disease caused spread, dang republicans! amiright guys?  Jes√∫s jumping jack Christ. known since diamond fucking princess. here‚Äôs ultimate question, would shut world cold 5x worse flu? 

If answer no, victims fear mongering public health officials politicians. answer yes, need decide cut is. obviously don‚Äôt give shit 0.1%. woman try convince medical examiners coroners making fake death certificates. Partly inflate numbers Democrats, partly hospitals could make ton money ""deaths"". don‚Äôt see could read denial. mother worked covid floor months. actually said hospitals get paid covid deaths. one close co workers grandfather died cancer cause death. hospital worked saw death certificate covid. took high powers hospital. said real virus real damage real people. Unfortunately government politics fucking numbers like always it‚Äôs always reason money. yup stay safe guys don‚Äôt believe everything media feeds yeah ! do! really do! ""Seem""...yep, hunch guess. :)

It's maddening! 0 new domestic case 0 new domestic asymptomatic cases, given happened Qingdao? virus control, need lockdowns even last resort, things, yes. things, no.  Eat rich? market starting look houses get bought back market rental properties know system getting f\*\*ed lol. World boiling point. Deaths per mile expected go longer drives statistically much safer curbed most. Accidents tend happen beginning end ride. Sorry, guess joke wasn‚Äôt clear. Technically flu season never came covid countries countries haven‚Äôt reached time year flu seasons point, think paranoid would bad thing. positive test rate still around 3% specific question... 

I back business trip Poland baffled amount people wearing masks covering nose .. idea really want start discussion matters looked like way winning..

So thing? Anyone Poland actually explain it? 

Also what‚Äôs face shields (that cover mouth) made plexy something hang really far away face . Thanks one talking record deals.

EMI means Extra Military instruction. Lock coffin leave rest us. please post preprint garbage? know become issue late preprint studies frequently pulled lack rigor peer review process. time happens people already internalised misrepresentation moved on, making difficult unlearn. She‚Äôs known sub attacking insulting people aren‚Äôt pro-complete lockdown years acting like she‚Äôs better everyone cause enjoys staying isolated no, she‚Äôs sarcastic unfortunately, also refuses accept covid-19 IFR 1% apparently everyone dares go outside lacks empathy murderer. Yes lol Sadly, probably happen. Can't fix stupid majority mean still big fucking deal something concerned about. store yesterday several people wearing masks, apparently get memo **but store clerks give flying shit it.**

To fair staff stores round UK seem told challenge dipshits getting violent told wear mask. Cant say blame want deal ignorant prick minimum wage. Lockdowns work, they‚Äôre hard organise. Lockdowns Wuhan covid free. born relation eating. born vegetarian (not vegan). choice parents. 47 years on, dont see reason change that. well actually idea eating meat bit similar idea perhaps eating grass, shit, mud. mind non edible. gross. grew older thoughts animal welfare health definitely come it. valid reasons becoming vegetarian. 

Actually think omnivorous (humans) philosophical aspect. eating meat times day eating meat sourced meat produced days really nonsensical (and gross). Meat imagine something eaten one could get hold it. staple. Trump right. immune. Southern Utah, Washington Iron county. big city St George Cedar City 45 minutes North. think SLC good spot. Southern Utah 300 miles SLC 120 Vegas landlocked kind dull night life. willing work, especially want trade single rent room work, place. trade school $1.50 hour want become plumber electrician good work ethic go school night work long days, say come learn trades. Also work Sunday , great! understand people want family people need things fixed done Sunday. 7 day average cases 60k 23 days July 10th August 2nd. currently around 49k.

The 7 day average deaths spent eight days 2k April 15th April 22nd. currently around 700. 

The real numbers still bad, need exaggerate. that's risk owning business common. people saying count covid death would like saying nobody died AIDS, whatever illness killed immune system shot (which often pneumonia funnily enough). pneumonia kills HIV AIDS killing years beforehand destroying immune system. Covid same, kill anyway, also destroys immune system temporarily kills lungs heart organs get something like pneumonia flu cold time right afterwards, enough kill otherwise wouldn't.
 
Another one like elderly people ""die fall"" break hip something. even breaking bone kills them, lot time, get infection along kills they're weakened state. countries? southern hemisphere thier flu seasons far New Zealand saw practically flu cases, dozen according article. think countries little. Thanks insight! Poor clinical study design, would take much this. 

- retrospective
- uncertain sampling method
- uncertain case definition
- dichotomised continuous variable (zinc level) Exactly....no

Just like drive places really need go bad snowstorms

People dumb can't seem realize wear mask stay hell away others. Meanwhile Solomon Islands got first 2 covid cases French Polynesia prime minister got virus country cases days coworker argued beginning people died false treatments. put vent early. 
As didn‚Äôt die corona then. unknown disease it‚Äôs part it. didn‚Äôt know handle doesn‚Äôt revive dead magically. 
My coworker dumb. Sir, Wendy's Great! That‚Äôs much better I‚Äôve seen subreddit: every little attempt relaxing total lockdown seen confirmation political figure murderer.

Beaches open? Murder!
Hair salons? Murder!

The mood seemed ‚Äúzero risk else!‚Äù.

Now, we‚Äôre talking policies, benefits costs, sounds lot reasonable. vouch that. got slammed head-on drunk driver van back college. crash investigator said thing saved combo seatbelt/airbag even seeing coming. (I turning left green, saw lights waaaaaaaay road judged plenty time even run light. Spoiler: not. going 100mph 35 zone, said.) normally many cases flu said covid restrictions made difference. article about. Fixing pandemic China symptom steelfisted regime power, killing millions Uyghurs influencing power nations.  


Dictatorship good times, regime respects science.  
But aspects dictatorship, bad. really bad. serial killer town killing 1-20 people day, months, would go like normal? Right, Australia lot less flu cases New Zealand had..

""It possible one died influenza season, Dr Nikki Turner, director Immunisation Advisory Centre, said""

""As far tell dozen cases flu""

So yeah Australia done well virus thier flu numbers down, really comparable New Zealand. Lmao nickname reply... Monday totals always lower. spike Tuesdays. then, bro? China terrible country, government CCP bad, like US, Trump administration bad. Also putting people ventilators earlier website from? Many family members I'm used it.

It's tend influence others want try luck want jump in. anymore, though.

Being laid since beginning, I've lots time read medical journals made free early pandemic.

Also, experience Stat tutor, used RStudio tutor, happen one much proficient laid electricians reading explaining information. know better treat certain number cases today results less deaths numbers cases back March/April. believe numbers either counter feeling understanding Chinese culture. widespread governmental distrust amongst population (that distrust violently weeded population Cultural Revolution), government says stay home wear mask, people it. Outside Hong Kong anyways.

Seems worth expense effort considering economy back track. Literally opposite strategy herd immunity economists. would one people. got sick earlier year. pneumonia, I'm financial crunch right would gone hospital late somewhere without socialized health care. People generally pass common sense see common sense assumptions, may wrong check even think obvious point factor new facts, opinion lockdowns change though? interesting whether countries like New Zealand experience much worse flu season average, terms mortality, next year. Flu generally kills frail susceptible. Theoretically, susceptible people following year?

Oh, didnt? respect that. least one person week make small talk following: blown proportion, serious, flu, etc

Still, thing cure worse disease. Yay celebrate bought paid championship. life long side-effects, like scarring, blood clots nerve damage?  compare five years? zombie jokes, now?! TWD got one thing really right. 

The zombies real danger. people. ROME ‚Äì new report published today shows people 25 countries set face devastating levels hunger coming months due fallout COVID-19 pandemic. greatest concentration need Africa, countries Latin America Caribbean, Middle East Asia ‚Äì including middle-income countries - also ravaged crippling levels food insecurity, according Early Warning Analysis Acute Food Security Hotspots, compiled World Food Programme Food Agriculture Organisation United Nations.

‚ÄúThree months ago UN Security Council, told world leaders ran risk famine biblical proportions,‚Äù said WFP Executive Director David Beasley. ‚ÄúToday, latest data tell us that, since then, millions world‚Äôs poorest families forced even closer abyss. Livelihoods destroyed unprecedented rate lives imminent danger starvation. Make mistake ‚Äì act end pandemic human suffering, many people die‚Äù

To prevent worst, WFP scaling provide food assistance unprecedented 138 million people face desperate levels hunger pandemic tightens grip fragile countries earth.

The cost WFP‚Äôs response burgeoning food insecurity accounts third updated COVID-19¬†Global Humanitarian Response Plan, largest appeal UN‚Äôs history, launched today, US$ 10 billion. plan covers wide-ranging humanitarian needs 60 countries, many already reeling impact conflict, climate change economic crisis. special provision $500 million earmarked prevent outbreak famine countries risk.

The number acute food insecure people at-risk countries could increase estimated 149 million pre-COVID-19 270 million end year life-saving assistance provided urgently. Recent estimates also suggest 6,000 children could die every day preventable causes next six months result pandemic-related disruptions essential health nutrition services. assume someone left train again? Well may right. Domestic issues also well suicides (except japan suicides actually down). Women can‚Äôt access safe places escape to, children trapped abusive situations. metro alone nearly 40 million, 146 cases!?

Tokyo's population roughly 14 million, 40.

But yeah, daily cases going roughly 50 \~ 250 late, reported cases weekend tests (so Monday \~ Tuesday reports) lowest partly due lower test capacity. live medical Council publishes weekly numbers excess deaths including covid estimate based that. Yes gov still publishes official death count, political thing many deaths are. can‚Äôt go bike ride something? Even IL Douche got it?!  one cannot wait audit ""pneumonia"" deaths.  Pretty sure Argentina longest lockdown world - exaggerating. incomprehensible human tragedy. difficult trauma recover from. Stay safe everyone. Wisconsin officials confirm cheese brains wait 2065. #ToyotaVirus Even manage crawl away dumpster fire Trump presidency, still horribly misinformed bigoted people voted power. going take years, decades repair, ever. hope doesn‚Äôt take another world war like WW2 6 million people die forces bigotry subside. How? study attributes excess deaths COVID directly far tell reading it. around 60 millions deaths per year, around 2.85 million USA - around 50,000 attributed influenza.  
With around 300,000 COVID-19 deaths far, theory means around +10% deaths 2020. 
However, median age COVID-19 deaths 80 more. 
So ""jump overall deaths"" spike possible events rapidly time, resulting identical number deaths. 
TLDR: expect less overall deaths vs mean, coming months years. rude ‚ÄúThe data suggest higher mortality rates inextricably linked socioeconomic disadvantage structural racism.‚Äù wonder President doesn‚Äôt want people scared. wants everyone go kill everyone hates.  way explaining fire control start throwing gasoline around?

It's really hard concept.

Nobody knew bad would get. phrase supposed mean exactly? like ‚Äúlost faith in‚Äù? widespread vaccination? Yes, problem.

So issue? it‚Äôs weren‚Äôt testing nearly much back That‚Äôs happened early NYC. emergency calls heart attack stroke victims skyrocketed people knew city dealing Covid. said lockdowns justified ""to buy time reorganize, regroup, rebalance resources, protect health workers exhausted. large, **we‚Äôd rather it.**‚Äù Google.

Countries require constant lockdowns never situation control.

New Zealand lock downs time wants NZ self sufficient, controlled well, lock finite, defined end open date.

To get China New Zealand's level lockdowns become optional, first control first lock down, follow opening back up.

These countries locked haphazardly, reopened haphazardly without plan.

If look Singapore, one lock down, opened back incrementally, almost back fully open many restrictions still place. follow good. lockdown decreased daily infections couple hundred per day, follow partial re-opening kept momentum going til 1 zero infections per day.

Extensive testing, extensive contact tracing, enforced quarantine really it. lock supposed used reset; pieces, keep locking down. ""Some are. stating virus exist cause single persons death?""

Also, ""Why countries took extreme measures seen increase suicides, drug overdoses, heart problems?""  know spell? couple separate domestic violence issues led homicide pretty quiet hometown back lockdown peak. conservative father ‚Äúif allowed go about, maybe wouldn‚Äôt pent anger killed.‚Äù [Of course alleged assault

Its video. hope throw book asshole. aha yes definitely asked proof can't catch driving car near someone. laws place make driving cars safer, like seat belts, speed limits, traffic laws, lights, etc. I'm sorry happened you. know one ruined evening. way would let took mask agreed bs.

It's really sad issue tearing family friends apart. remove countries able control spread welding people shut inside houses, left exceptions: NZ, Australia, Japan, South Korea others.

And long list countries tried extremely hard, sacrificed economies freedom months: Spain, Italy come mind. 

They failed, lack trying. extremely contagious virus. question countries answering now: live *with* virus.

We know whole lot now, makes virus lot less scary. 3% estimated mortality initially, turns lot less, varies close 0% kids teenagers, 3-4% people eighty. DoD covid stats show 8 military personnel died, 33,000+ cured far, effective CFR .024 (2.4 10,000). numbers known while, never really accepted terms public discourse. 

Because that, countries like France Spain silently implement ‚Äúcohabitation‚Äù measures (keeping schools open, keeping restaurants open, etc). country like France, locked 1000 cases per day, still widely open 26,000/day. saying extra 36% primarily died indirectly result living pandemic world (ie; afraid go doctor illnesses, inability afford prescriptions due economic hardship, etc..) vs died directly virus itself?

Not trying incite anything here, want sure understand. Doubt read article.. trying political, I‚Äôm expecting anything done Trump gets voted office. least know false negative rate 27.5%. 1-5% chance young people dying covid. It‚Äôs two orders magnitude lower. rate around 70 1 comorbidity approximately 5% - it‚Äôs fallen since treatments better now. bet people can't afford care.

My brother told something along lines of, *""I'm going doctor, can't afford it. I'll definitely go hospital serious""*. like, know serious late? Fear weird things people. Ignorance bliss, people it‚Äôs easier make problem mask another ignore it. live near NYC get news much. happened March-april? What's cuase?  live America Lol let buddy, everything‚Äôs gonna okay.

Now, naturally people's behaviour changed significantly since began, due cautious actions, surprise occurring. said, vast, vast, majority deaths exceed would expected average due coronavirus itself. So, summary, people pointing incorrect absolute sense, incorrect saying something like comes across misleading, suggests greatest issue facing deaths effects quarantine measures, way virus itself.  problem. need blood test intravenous, usually know advance. guess ask make appointment. worse happen they'll say, ""no"". Thanks warning. Right here. viruses like this. isn‚Äôt different viruses. We‚Äôre hyper aware. Flus colds vary severity too.  time people looking death vs survival. people get heart lung organ damage COVID even recover? seems like significant fraction cases. gives chronic health problems takes 10 years lives 50 year olds survive immediate infection, that's significant cost we're ignoring. like fire burning town counting people froze death night houses burned exposed elements, yes. know many people would died thirst example - - care. know X people dead precipitating cause fire. fire disrupted everything choice let everyone die, use water let people die - that's still deaths. dead people care killed them, know fire happened they'd alive. That's perfectly valid metric - excess deaths many people died precipitating event never happened. That's people actually care - trying micro blame specific death specific cause. like trying claim 9/11 jumpers actually die building collapse, technically killed terrorists. stupid distinction, people insist making probably agenda.

You like use it. policy makers scientist want bottom line total. That's excess deaths is, used epidemiology century that's matters. read finding still births related Covid significant number pregnant women receiving prenatal care ordinarily would have. may people avoiding hospitals doctors offices fear contracting Covid, result risk factors preeclampsia missed.

1) influenza doesn‚Äôt appear impact survivors COVID does. Rates hospitalisation appear much higher COVID younger demographic. appears fairly significant tissue damage COVID survivors don‚Äôt understand well yet.

2) compare influenza mortality stats COVID mortality stats, it‚Äôs worth noting influenza mortality follows similar age group pattern. it‚Äôs numbers *also significantly skewed deadly influenza elderly* it‚Äôs curve *an order magnitude bigger*.

Edit: citations:
The data indicates influenza IFR around 0.07%. Likewise COVID around 1% IFR, variable based underlying conditions like quality health service, that‚Äôs 14 times dangerous per individual, likely similarly weighted towards 74.8% influenza deaths 65+ age see Spain suffered high levels excess mortality even younger, working population aged 15‚Äì64, Germany experienced relatively low levels mortality even vulnerable population aged 85+. says masks effective mitigating spread people wear them. saying ""the selective use masks"" effective people wearing patient asymptomatic still shedding.

Many people aren‚Äôt healthy. people aren‚Äôt truly healthy.

The real question happens survivors long run. far looks like end lingering symptoms. every person dies, many higher risk heart attack stroke lung liver issues road year two ten?

I agree. Ebola would easier fight, even though it‚Äôs much lethal. Also one countries female leader. man world accomplished Jacinda Ardern accomplished terms COVID. Yes, many us figure that.

Quick Google: ‚Äúat time, early SARS-CoV-2 intervention melatonin well supported,‚Äù says Cesar Borlongan, neurologist University South Florida. Much rigorous research needed determine whether molecule regulate sleep-wake cycles.¬†

A doctor Texas treated hundred people melatonin proof melatonin treats covid. 

There one trial find ongoing university invested heavily melatonin research prior this(University Buffalo). 

Unless telling folks take melatonin. case sound incredibly annoying. seems like wear wash masks much underwear I'm sure disagreement then. Cuba less tourism countries. That's said.  contrary source, cite it.  insult. people. gets complexity ascribe deaths. Sure, policy decisions made due COVID called ""deaths COVID"" happened without COVID, policymakers may also chosen policy options would resulted fewer deaths. saying masks effective. actually saying selectively wearing masks around symptomatic people ""limited use"" (not ""useless, person claims) even people symptomatic still shed virus. 

But point effective mitigating spread people wear them. seems like silly standard use. Using logic people ""keep together"" they're allowed go bars restaurants. 

There reason churches can't hold services lower limit per service, meet outside online services continue practice faith without killing people. There‚Äôs reason ‚ÄúHallway Medicine‚Äù term.

Seriously, 2020 look tame thing becomes deadly MERS yet remains contagious. Going logic... 1.25 million people die auto accidents every year, many injured, whenever get vehicle put others risk. Yet us get car daily earning living, moving around, living life, essential deemed worth risks. social interaction. virus doesn‚Äôt change that. try careful drivers use seat belts minimize risk, obviously take common sense measures slow spread virus. stop life months, years? That‚Äôs question. 

I‚Äôm sure get downvoted hell since nobody‚Äôs allowed question wisdom lockdowns, oh well. also probably easiest complete way suss number. let normal death rate background even painstakingly control every possible way people die. let nature tells background background subtraction basically give estimated numbers abnormal deaths. best way science stats let nature heavy lifting. actually went doctor rash, said likely COVID.

You possibly comparing countries Europe island you?

EU countries probably literally interconnected countries world. factually boarders. world compare country virtually shut world compound countries can't possibly shut ohter's ""landlocked"" neighbors whole economy based neighbors?

If one country shuts borders kills 20% its' neighbor's economy vice versa.

It's completely mute comparison.

Can stop ""let's like NZ/Taiwan!1!"" refrain? nowhere near applicable European country, bar Iceland possibly. Lmao whooshing getting whooshed point cannot infinite growth finite system

First all, think trying infinite growth? Germany? population actually shrinking. Germany housing crisis places people want live, time 1 million homes standing empty, want live there. Sure, technical work narrow problem, get degree, thing real scientist.

Adding knowledge base exactly scientists do. knows? obscure fact molecular interaction might key solving viral infections. sceptical first clearly worked 2020‚Äôs abnormally high pneumonia deaths looking super sus.

No, think level bit truth sense hospital getting check. think come hospitals got allocated extra state fund federal funds started covid deaths. goal boost hospitals ability deal overload, staffing, equipment whatever. 

I proof this. thought money fake to, many people mentioning it, assumed wrong. understood. value money, people.  really doesn‚Äôt matter many cases China has. China chance react spread completely new infectious disease, knew local level). Disregarding fact China could prevented disease ever coming existence cracking sale exotic animals wet dirty conditions. 

Instead none tries blame rest world faults own. 

The truth is, even countries world could handled disease ways spread mainland China ‚Äî didn‚Äôt need to, China dealt shit.

Once escaped, China still told world control ‚Äî international health agencies, threatened soft power China advised quarantining China. Advise much Europe followed, allowing disease get foothold outside China. 

So thank China blatantly pro-Chinese sub, antagonizing world blaming others failure. people outside reddit-bubble sick shit. What‚Äôs side? Covid, probably. heart goes even though don‚Äôt know me. Hang there. need thing happened start, deny hide idiotic statement. must incredibly privileged think that. Read article. mentioned this. Yes, know messed care homes right thing apologised it. However, done lot better summer months bar care home issue start pandemic really think anyone say they've done good job. learnt mistakes lot say leaders around world. isn't? then? Well put (it‚Äôs easier make problem ‚Äúmask‚Äù another). Someone read article Genuine question, would cost going see doctor affect ACE/Obama Care? Let's say there's ACE/Obama Care, would brother's statement same?

I live US, citizen I'm aware health care stuff citizens get (I'm F1 visa). Except cost lockdown subsequent contact tracing much lower cost one wave another.

Also make sure Sweden faces consequences crimes ~~a miracle~~ science education save us.

let's real here. people trying reach shit going care 10 million dead long happen people listen believe true already stressed max shit. leave 200000. Fuck funny assume would work. buddy lab manager CA. said dont know long term effects kids. model fighting pandemic followed.

Yeah. Maybe American model one follow? /s Jesus fucking Christ, no, not. That's many people died COVID. complicated. economic damages occur lockdowns lockdowns? one highest death rates world? Sounds amazing fact still highest ratio deaths per population fact never minimum ""block"" spread, numbers new infections reaching time high using ""measures"" Pointless engage morons think so. mean zero lock almost masks people still work go school, caution. Ok, let hospitality sector open. 25% contagions happens places. epidemic explodes (ss serms happening) reach point harder measures implemented, affecting hospitality sector, also bussines thst otherwise could functioned relative normality.

Or option B. nothing , avoid family pub day wish. Infection goes control, nothing unfair fir business. problem that, unlike you, many people need givernmentto tell careful responsible, alter consumption anyway, mention tourists nit comming back since safer destinations, wich affect hospitality anyway, eventually bussiness. 

But well, sure, worried economy employement. think pubs bussiness exist anything else sacrificed behalf, maybe reevaluate relationship alcohol. begining affect brain. think better job maybe step instead backseat driver?

you rich enough make everyone states listen think forgot word ‚ÄòNOT‚Äô New York Times pretty good page update might go different page get breakdown states, it. 

I quite entertained states know count, eg. New York, California.  mean? ‚ÄúExcess deaths include COVID deaths ascribed causes, well indirect consequences...could include people afraid go hospital another condition fear catching coronavirus number issues caused exacerbated COVID-19‚Äôs economic mental health impacts, loss health insurance layoffs, inability afford medications pay cuts, skyrocketing rates depression America‚Äôs adults...‚Äù

There value study, yet avoids people simply want know. many people COVID virus actually directly killed, fatal virus?

In fact almost measures China took invented West, makes infuriating governments failed controlling covid-19 China successful economy going again. reuse mask without washing it. use week, that.

So think virus already dead time reuse them. person need pdp

I'm sure fairytale world live nearly everyone complies. guarantee U.S.


I work city that's mask requirements since early on. 10% coworkers wear masks. coworkers took work beginning, never worn masks since returning. work home 90% time, dont wear masks come in. Customers crap shoot. 


And many co-workers avoid businesses gone years requiring masks. Restaurants, barbers, gyms requiring masks takeout... Nope drive next county get maskless haircut, able dine-in. whine lockdowns hurting businesses love.

Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Btw t18ptn massive troll r/coronavirusuk. wouldn‚Äôt believe word say suppose sign times misread ""Rotterdam mayor Tweets positive Covid-19"". Japanese social, clusters stay contained people meeting large groups house parties etc.

When virus hits workplace, there's usually large, untested cluster. But, outside spread little.

It's literally coincidence unique Japanese culture nothing government policy.

It might hold line, winter increases infectiousness, virus spread trains, case Japan screwed. know exactly gets news schools need shut, half term next week, bound see drop new cases next week half term, course government claim shutting pubs working. 

It's pubs behind new wave schools, shut already. I'm sorry loss, friend. need get everyone board defeat pandemic. 

Hygiene, masks, social distancing ‚Äì spread message, virus. WTF know could DIE Crohn's! would assume something similar spring lockdown : Non essential public business closed, companies asked set-up homeworking employee can, distancing others First all, think trying infinite growth? Germany? population actually shrinking.

You confusing population economic growth.

Both unsustainable, economic growth alone sufficient lead unsustainable state.

Of course, moment deep overshoot need 95% reduction global population serious reduction per capita consumption too.

We pushing growth instead... That's first account Western CDC acknowledge food transmission, trying downplay. entire GOP fails see point... (it ineffective)

His base told money, trust him. base likes paid CompanyBucks.... Visit linked subreddit risk. may high amount misinformation.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* BTW t18ptn massive troll r/coronavirusuk. wouldn‚Äôt believe word say Liberty_Call Japan society people socialize much. don't. flu bad sometimes Japan, even bad people live normally go bars. Now, people living normally.

It's typical house parties ALL. social gatherings often quite small, rare even.

Virus outbreaks seem stay contained workplace clusters, since Japan undertests, counted.

But, exponential growth Japan people socialize large groups.

You understand SARS-2 overdispersed (only 20% spread others, 80% never do). social gatherings small really lowers R0. average social event included people, R would increase.

With evenly dispersed viruses, 100% people pass virus even rate, size social gatherings affect R much. Ignore research scientists article people... Rhonin1313 research. ! ! can't say exactly, generally Thailand quite strong community ties little formal welfare. 

The people tourist industry living savings, going back family farm (which often near-subsistence almost cashless existence), getting jobs industries. 

So see actual famine, wider economy functioning so, slip cracks, affected kind support network. see lot businesses wiped out, they'll lose capital, definitely significant event. imagine everything dies sweltering heat climate change. one feels bad yet, maybe people take hint even pope calls action it. Yes sir extended family always planned things generations prepared 25 30 people. never factored many infants newborns older children babies well own. made lots adjustments think we've got covered eye-opening. wish truth it‚Äôs not. They‚Äôve drunk much koolaid don‚Äôt need forced anymore. koolaid forced first anymore. would fewer anti mask people government experts present unified front instead shit show mixed messaging. Directing hatred China smart move. long people busy blaming China, realise sloppy irresponsible government is. Ischgl disgrace... also precautions smoking. Obesity less so, sadly. source first claim there? Swedens deathrate compared Norway, Denmark Finland? Ya know countries similar Sweden

All places *tried*. Idk details tho possible leaders put justice aswell.

Well, possible exception US UK. I'd argue Swedens failure even harder.

Belgium, Spain Italy hit early. time prepare.

Also another major difference, none countries army brainwashed goons spreading lies missinformation internet. Sweden does. avarage Swede much brainwashed moron countries bring up. countries leaders need put justice, Sweden entire fucking population (or atleast 60% majority still supports Tegnell) Yes that‚Äôs point. right / anti mask crew try tell everyone make choice economy letting people die. it‚Äôs false choice. work hard smart save lot lives minimize economic impact. matter world interconnected. obviously think good leadership one awareness apologise mistakes made. 1) collected.

2) Incompetence. agree anti-lockdown crowd. governors call lockdowns, where's funding antibody studies? exist. country anywhere. Political leaders understand science, science leaders primadonnas trapped politics face fields.

3) answers this, mostly UK trickling also countries. seems happening, little coordination urgency.

4) Like said, South Korea this. South Korea also virus control. world control. Indirectly, there's answer.

5) Incompetence. Politics science profoundly imcompetent. think, right left agree businessmen greedy selfish hyper-motivated, businesses would put together plan deal COVID save bottom lines. Nah. Businessmen like politicians scientists, even incompetant. Businessmen profoundly dumb people. get credit smarts have, exercise poorly field lot pretenders even dumber dumb (life sciences/environmental) scientists.

6) There's answer this. selfish 20% hit herd immunity. 80% herd immunity. delays lockdowns 3 weeks 8 weeks (looking Melbourne), end, selfish idiots hit herd immunity. buys 2 months time. ""oh believe corona parents sister died want send message world that's sent 80 times listen affected me"".

7) seems, virus survive well. cold cloudy months might affect that. I'm pretty confident frozen food products problem. virus may survive infectious (keyword, kind seems need high enough dose get sick one virion done virus) form surfaces long, signs freeze virus totally chill problem.

8) Yeah, I'd love know. least, stupid emphasis washing hands, Domino's pizza guy mouth breathing pizza??? word. I'll add airplanes. Mixed messages airplanes. desire establishment answer them.

9)Good question. Let add, sewage. We've heard toilet water stack apartment building infect (with SARS), maybe cases China SARS-2. So... Public restrooms??? Airplanes?? Because... viral load breathing differ there's ""superspreader"" overdispersion 80% seem infect others, everything I've heard poop totally full virus. So..........

10) People actively want answer this. live Japan. love blame sinful activities virus spreading events. Total silence offices, supermarkets trains. Current U.S. IFR:

 0-19 years: 0.00003 
20-49 years: 0.0002 
50-69 years: 0.005 
70+ years: 0.054 based outcomes real Americans--from slimmest pre-diabetic overweight vast morbidly obese. thing everyone better summer months expected better relatively performance. UK health code associated every person checked whenever enter building? trace every movement every citizen point know long certain person outside? spy social media point censoring single posts use certain banned keywords going people's homes softly threatening them?

Because that's part China's surveillance system. least trial run belt case shtf November. guess question - far natural peak they, much hospital capacity likely available? 

At 245 cases/100k/week detected, nationwide, that's 2/3 peak Florida summer, seems model far go basically nothing, albeit much warmer temperatures. 

I've idea good testing though, i.e., they're identifying almost cases they're getting tenth true numbers, expect flu. true case numbers 40k/day, population 11M, herd-immunity-by-spring numbers... might notice conditions met, corona spread, lockdown lifted, get get. wash mask daily. Well, also ""makes sense"" Chinese satisfied governments response choice perfectly satisfied CCP tells to. would compare Sweden worst hit countries world, thousands miles away, neighbors share borders, climate, social demographic characteristics?

Here death toll Sweden compared three countries borders:

Deaths per million:
Sweden 570
Denmark 115
Finland 63
Norway 51 Wishing best! supposed visit Argentina last month course Covid got way... beautiful country hope finally see over. sorry that's happening. love Argentina fantastic place. hope stay safe well.. drink mate!!no sharing... best wishes New Zealand. really, really strong mask usage, though. brink surge back summer, materialize deaths likely due strong mask usage. recent data Aus showing survive almost month select surfaces like phones keyboards, hopefully see major changes severity. Like packaged food refrigerators, Korea habit claiming everything Korean. Shameless. Well even country (Germany) lies numbers total deaths.. officially it‚Äôs like 10k March april June always twice 3 times much death announcement pages local papers. Don‚Äôt get wrong Germany really good job containing virus still seems like lying way go worldwide... Ya, they're second wave. us never left first wave.  think much earlier Feb know people died unknown pneumonia others COVID symptoms early late November. condolences. Hugs. Ah ok. happened you, therefore can't widespread problem. True... little bit agree disagree. Hong Kong Taiwan done incredibly well supressing virus barely deaths, however economically countries hard worse others done worse supressing virus. 50% cases chronic symptoms. anti-math? UK comparable levels surveillance, including part five eyes 14 eyes alliance share data government spy citizens another government spying.

And jokes aside, people consider UK democracy. Like packaged food refrigerators, mean? thats fresh air ventilation for. bring filtered air flush stagnant air potentially virus. want really get depressed numbers? 

The bombs Hiroshima Nagasaki killed (direct indirect) 230000 people best estimates... Trump overseen genocide American people outstretching impact 2 nuclear devices war. dose matter? 5 hours arbitrary af number lol, instead 5 lets say 17 then. point still stands. Oh thank God apologized. fixes everything. yeah? know lot school districts extremely lax guidelines stuff like masks? teachers zero say cant enforce shit. Still change opinion though.

Incorrect. baby boomers heard stories friend friend's mother dying natural causes, getting classified COVID genuinely deceived reflexive misinformation feedback loop.

Once people saw data, (including parents, take care last living grandparent) felt deceived conspiracy rumors.

The red flags (""friend friend"",etc.) insisted I'd prove wrong confident rumors relied strongly every zip-code county-level time series completely fabricated day, even though archiving zip-code data myself.

Here's R code generate recent forever, seem better way go.

I know anyone Thailand though, cannot confirm people taken care of, evicted left starve death. Yer Europe well summer. think early call winning strategy yet. ban misusing ""up to"" headlines? ""Alternative facts"" usual Belgium rules meant broken. vaccine used that‚Äôs it

""Experts"" already hinted may need two shots gain immunity, mutating nature virus means would lkely get regular boosters keep up. Multiply 7-8 billion start see kind money made here. Honestly I'm shocked better many countries without lockdowns.

Kinda makes wonder. course fake definitely don‚Äôt fake much. virus basically gone China citizens happy. That‚Äôs fact. would know otherwise Articles evidence intentionally overdosed people morphine? heard this. thing china pull together obey restrictive hivemind-like orders. ""The needs many outweigh needs few"" one thing China really well. enforce to.

Like Australia public holiday purely swat flies. Australians would swat flies, would sit around whatever wanted do. China would swat flies fly swatting day. 

So something like quarantine China likely better lot places. Yes tend lie anything might make look bad, high population density would work them. would done really badly first, shut shit pretty quickly. 6 months later think would easily passed countries able shut down. I‚Äôve seen argument used illegal immigrants. Y'all testing least 4000 people day april. Death coming everyone dude, one way another get ride. covid distraction rulling class pulled another one us. guess like bending over, getting fucked spoon fed beliefs tho. Enjoy scared living fear. choose believe. wipe ass expect people like smell smearing. mean no? around january 20 march china counted asymptomatic cases. atm known situation better personal statement sure better know you... really understand starting ""No,"" reply comment.... researched it, stemmed one person claiming adminstrators could potentially alter patient discharge forms (I know that's proper term, going memory) make cause death covid get slightly reimbursement. one case occurring far. 

Wouldn't amazing witchhunts potential misconduct aimed actual misconduct within certain administrations... feel they're going beat this. Hopefully Malaysia follow soon - looked like coming close. love response.

Guy says ""the numbers fake, people people believe fake number course rate well""

your response ""It makes sense numbers good"".

Are trying funny paid troll?

China fakes numbers, naive acknowledge that?

I would estimate maybe 40 countries fake them. European countries others like NZ, Australia likes. coworkers this, including management. I'm surrounded idiots putting life risk, either starve. Nono, Sweden course.

Lol Cases surging. England needs lock now. I'd love Thailand right now, especially Covid-free. 

But cost keeping Thailand Covid-free is/was making sure left country March (after testing negative hospital) keeping me, everyone like me, out.

While Thailand's infrastructure quite bad make ‚Äî they're middle-income country good healthcare system relative economic strength ‚Äî one really well-equipped deal guarantee that, even tourism fully open, occupancy would floor people would suffering nearly badly. 

When factor benefits wider economy Covid-free, closing borders no-brainer, painful may be. effective vaccine rapid testing come stream, decision change - even Covid eradicated rest world point. !remindme 1 day Glad I'm one wondering this. seems like closer country epicenter outbreak, less severe outbreak is.

It could behavioral...populations exposed previous viruses like SARS/MERS better complying public health measures...but people *that* different across world. previous exposure changed behavior much seeing 2nd waves west.

It take years, bet we'll eventually find something biologically unique East Asia we're seeing yet. Quick--someone ring Terry Malick shoot bubble save film industry! think they‚Äôre referring drastic lockdown chinese style. Put thesaurus away, get Reddit moment leave house change. Fuck them, dude. keep protect yourself. they‚Äôre gonna figure life depends it, they‚Äôre worth time anyway. Keep up, dude! üëç Mischaracterizing another person's position another deplorable habit. 

Those paragraphs benefit. Deplorable opinions substance carry weight. ssssshhh

natural selection

dnd say old immunocomprimised. may seems long time since outbreak 10% might infected worldwide. There's stll much loose give now. go catch covid spread bc can‚Äôt eat chilli dog inside think anytime soon? fuck. Honey don‚Äôt think protests you‚Äôre seeing often, it‚Äôs neighborhood written yesterday swedish papers AFP got access new information.

Also posted article hints got new information. depression era unemployment

Have seen unemployment numbers countries went strict lockdown early reopened 2-3 months later simple measures like mask mandates/social distancing? compare countries still struggling ‚Äúfamine biblical proportions‚Äù

Already explained. Lockdowns nothing famine considering agricultural trade flows largely unaffected them.

Can stop obviously false hyperbole? Good luck. witnessing anything sort. need help. funny think helping when, fact, part goddamn problem. Seems pretty reasonable. Sorry anecdotes aren‚Äôt gunna work something scale. could also argue everyone know gotten sick described bad cold. 

And never see Covid death numbers like March April quicker treatments better messaging. think come spring, regulations like suggestions anything. we‚Äôre simply sustainable. again. way Yes, stopping 80%! KS, one asked us see friends/family. I'm allowed call Zoom want do. Yes, big public gatherings shut that's 100% reasonable. Re-opening makes zero sense all. one cancelled holidays here. blatant fear mongering. virus real, definitely way protect vulnerable populations without causing excess death. We‚Äôve ultimately failed that. literally article talking give government reason yearly lockdowns. take 300mg ranitidine daily GERD. recalled eventually came MAR-ranitidine (canada) take replacement. Man whole country denial virus late january early february. called normalcy Heroic. someone high risk bad outcome contract Covid, personally grateful them. Call police.  didn‚Äôt say Trump expert. think clever comment something? Google it. theyre not. weren't. Anyone brain, ie: especially covid experts, see dangerous. kind fetish boots orange guys? person bringing Trump, insistent watching people lick Trump's boots? year CCP let visit Wuhan lab? comment? media reporting corona obviously flaws. average journalist expert epidemiology etc, shows reporting. unique problem Sweden. Swedishg left wing conspiracy however. ""Lockdowns COVID fear/restrictions caused approximately 70k excess mortality US.""

is correct headline would never get upvoted. Another life gone soon. entire point comment. know people US Brazil think covid conspiracy presidents. It‚Äôs personal attack, it‚Äôs observation üòÇü§£ mild average individual. know dozen people got it. mild maybe 2-3 them. rest them, including myself, got sick week. Trump even remotely like normal case. know guy ran fever 9 days straight. 

And again, one saying everything needs completely shut down. Reasonable regulations reached. Opening everything restrictions reasonable unless completely ok covid top 3 cause death country years come. Lol ^ someones never prison ^ parody account, right? took seriously before, now? Nah. think ""pockets"" subdued virus, representing LOT deaths (New York + NJ, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts‚Ä¶) raise weeks? reading article, states allegedly added death toll due complications lock down, COVID-19. title misleading. People want desperately believe countries low case numbers (and death totals) somehow virtuous strong ""following science."" countries opposite experience dumb selfish backwards. want COVID armageddon war Enlightenment, 300 years later still raging. reality nowhere near simple. Pero por que? curve‚Äù became ‚Äúsquish curve‚Äù

Among countries considering second lockdown, daily cases represent curves still flattened?

If not, aside Victoria, region goal hospitals sat empty staff furloughed laid off.

This seems like obviously false narrative given hospitals would function pre-COVID cases. taken down, feel divided divisive, also telling character. link article video ""apology"". certainly terrible, acting like ‚ÄúCovid caused those‚Äù heck stretch

Covid restrictions caused those. argument side. think understand *how* narcissistic people DJT. barely understand myself--but, yes, *number* people think whole world faking they're *jealous* amazing DJT is. mean ""Covid death reporting"" conspiracy larger issue nuts.

I thought singling California saying mostly right wing phenomena.

Please respond wrong. Thanks can't one thinks comment unnecessarily aggressive, right?

Just tell think they're wrong, dude. mean it. Precisely! That‚Äôs lockdowns started, tools prevent health system getting overwhelmed. ‚ÄúFlatten curve!‚Äù

And saw followed.

‚ÄúFlatten curve‚Äù became ‚Äúsquish curve‚Äù, hospitals sat empty staff furloughed laid off. I‚Äôm sure LAPD would happy wag finger enforce anything post exhibits deflection. something want people focus on, find convenient scapegoat.

There point discussing logic person like this, goal nothing truth reality. steering narrative another direction get caught pants down. Um yes, have. graduated school last year due shutdowns, can't find job field. 6 months, see friends family, Massachusetts, bars, clubs, concerts, sports, conventions cancelled vaccine.

We can't parties, Thanksgiving, Christmas, Halloween cancelled.

The thing old life enjoy play video games.

We definitely asked give lives save elderly. see Cali. May suggest weed? really need step away sub. relax. Best wishes side country. Think hard gonna though... like herding flies Man imagine would happening Wisconsin Walker still charge. would absolute carnage. read article, basically sums deaths caused lockdowns, Coronavirus. that's claim statistically definitely true.

granted, people knew neighbours 80 years ago, compared people literally live next one another without knowing others names, still bullshit. Overdose listed thr cause death find someone dead needle arm. Generally opiates.

Rarely deaths stimulants, alcohol, ot sleeping pills listed overdose.

Heart attacks young folk frequently involve drug alcohol use/abuse.

Your car crash comment seems indicative failure rational. alcohol drugs frequently cause car crashes, would presume cause most. reasonable car crashes overall would down, telecommuting example... car crashes alcohol drugs would up... Clients die car crashes rarely get tested drugs/alcohol system... 

Over complete failure recognize significant collateral damage covid response... Whether advocate responses.. Sickens me.

Another way look numbers would look covid deaths versus increase deaths causes response deaths.

Look know died year. many covid versus causes? read article headline marginal less informative Neither lockdowns stage. many asymptomatic superspreaders. Italy severe casualties. rest world reopen let old vulnerable quarantine own. I'm rather wearing masks taking chances flu ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre opinions beneath shun you, let respond three paragraph write-up first‚Äù lmao.

That includes lockdowns country risk getting overwhelmed. involves follow-up measures like mask mandates certainly social distancing maintain benefits lockdown. One wonders long term effects healthcare workers elderly shoulder burden, especially places without lockdown.

There hundreds thousands deaths, millions, road governments handled covid. people want call covid death... fine.... im done arguing it.  people half brain knows going on. Actually... need stop think flu spreads around world ""flu seasons""...

The reason nearly non-existent flu season wearing masks, admitting people overseas without putting quarantine.

The influenza virus coronavirus similar symptoms, nearly identical modes transmission. Anything stop spread one, also affect other.

We basically stopped year's flu season border, way stopped coronavirus. basically handing tests like trick treat candy now. Early handle demand plenty now. also deep swab anymore nice. I've tested times work since July. necessarily effort. Doctors field one calling death putting cause. likely scenario lot deaths people otherwise appeared healthy rapidly deteriorated died seeking treatment, people believed (correctly) afford treatment, people already dealing disease exacerbated virus died without knowing virus (this one relatively simple analyze data).

Another unlikely possibility virus actually presents one manners aware of, killing people manner inconsistent believe see. Like sudden heart failure without much symptoms, instance. would seem death caused something else. data indicates COVID causing strokes people age 25.

Zero.

Zilch.

You wrong. Accept it. Stop arguing. I've lost count many comments I've remove today. Stop calling people deplorable, stop insulting users. Much like fucking wage gap, factors unaccounted data. bullshit propaganda. let know heart disease kills around rate Covid. silly happens them? even used fur? also saying ""the important issue consider socialization,"" he's saying BE. thing.

This reading comprehension issue part. construction implies true fact truth. Look way:

""Not killing could bad, worse killing yourself.""

You read imploring kill yourself? @thedirtygame said. Put fan inside garage door blowing out. Good ventilation go long way lowering viral load air any. suggest masks still good idea scenario. March April two months ago, right. Damn got ass tax rich wrongdoings poor? Heart disease: hold beer clarify far know also trailing China, suggesting testing people first ensure safe. believe. Mostly it, could reasoned exacerbated issues may resulting death. marking covid related makes sense. TRIGGERED üòÇ üòÇ üòÇ üòÇ üòÇ


(Awww, little feelings got hurt went nuts report button lol) Argentina one strictest lockdowns world? so, would mean lockdown necessarily correlated case death counts. /r/ImmigrationCanada, need it. discuss possible conflicts interest involved POTUS got taking Remdesivir? realize ski resort thought ground zero European part pandemic read article. know seems long ago, seemed Lombardy even France good shape mid-March. comment likely well-received sub, goes:

The NYT losing credibility days weeks go by, been, opinion, past 4-5 years. really shame since used consider providing top-teir, objective journalism albeit slightly left-leaning. Now, offer little New York Post higher reading level.

I know media seems hellbent pushing narrative we'll wearing masks, distancing continuing miserable basically ad infinitum following widespread availability even moderately effective vaccine (or vaccines). everyone access least one vaccine, close zero political capital spent intrusive draconian public health measure public appetite them. Hell, there's hardly absence vaccine homerun treatments. I'm sociologist political strategist, take expert figure out. people found out. cause panic. Like happen March human like they're prone abuse already desperate situation Well I‚Äôm exhausted. dude? get kind sick hard-on lockdown? 

Have good one! Lol. Health reporters make distinction died died due COVID. Canada came half ""hospitalized COVID cases"" people age 20 actually hospital reasons COVID. 6% COVID deaths conditions, average number conditions COVID patient died almost three(CDC). Considering average age death literally older life expectancy average person. 95% deaths going die anyways next 3 years causes cracking down. choce words headline give sinfull associations. understand evidence nice, useful certain situations, however comes likely true reality better ways measure. don‚Äôt disagree pandemic could hand it, it‚Äôs lie it‚Äôs stretch. could could one multiple factors led them. help? Likely not, argument it‚Äôs certainly even leading factor. It‚Äôs right try ‚Äúinflate‚Äù Covid numbers searching deaths try add total. virus deadly enough, taken seriously face value. argument trying add stuff like makes skeptics skeptical reaches like trying force correlation. mink culling? important get rid them? Thousands USA, netherlands this... hear species culling. Dogs, cats 50 others species able get covid better already tested positive read mink culling... Anybody smarter give answer? Taxes poor always great. Bingoooo Here's latest case/death charts Los county currently 67.18 deaths per 100k, slightly US per capita average 64.43. gov even state, campaign Trump states. don‚Äôt care us. ""...ahead peer reivew...""

Okay, let's pump breaks last thing need knee jerks reaction often conflicting reports virus. saying day one. Especially know heart attacks, strokes illnesses caused infected COVID19. Everything turns political here........... fucking everything.

Seriously, talk treatment possibly keep fingers keyboard.... hard. possibly exposed covid morning. soon self isolate? need wearing mask hiding wife right away able wait day without endangering her. least bit scared anxious might stating it, pretty hard least 'somewhat concerned' family infected. 

To fair point, would describe 'somewhat concerned' family member get serious car accident. mean let significantly alter lifestyle, beyond wearing seatbelt (mask?) encouraging loved ones same. 1-25 year olds study 1-25 year olds suffered COVID caused strokes time frame study. age 25, evidence need concerned COVID causing stroke. Zero. Show one piece evidence people 25 dying COVID caused strokes. I‚Äôm even holding original claim ‚Äúmany people‚Äù, show otherwise healthy person age 25 died medical experts believe COVID caused stroke. 

You can‚Äôt. wrong. know you‚Äôre willing admit me, there‚Äôs probably piece that‚Äôs accepting conclusion. maybe future you‚Äôll remember next time deadly pandemic ravaging globe, perhaps stop impulse ‚ÄúOH BOY, get yell people online!‚Äù  Ooooh explains everything state excess deaths due Covid. Predictable...  Yep, belongs horses. total fucking bullshit propaganda. Holy fuck ignorant. Actually, 5 million... coronavirus also foreign visitors per head population US.

In 2017, 70 million tourists visited US - equivalent 20% US population. year, 3.73 million tourists visited New Zealand - equivalent 78% population.

In 2019, 400,000 Chinese nationals visited New Zealand.

If think island - jet age - makes difference, mistaken.

The difference got here, difference arrived. literally didnt. See comment below. brought up. Stop arguing yourself. everyone that's vulnerable gets paid leave stay home hang pandemic over. Perfect logic there. made point me. Stop BS rate, worth arguing.

Type RIP social media search figure many died covid versus response.

Most honestly tried come conclusion. trailing countries China. mean misinformation like this:

* currently (as Oct 2) estimates [10% world population 1M deaths, 1M/780M = 0.13% COVID infection fatality ratio.
* [2.5 million child marriages due government reaction: girls can't go school, parents revert old ways: [By 2021, many 150 million additional people likely extreme poverty due government policies COVID-19: World [Year life lost increased poverty due government actions 16X years life lost COVID: World references highly-regarded sources. here's latest case/death charts South Dakota, running 7-day curves look good.

Currently South Dakota 32.43 deaths per 100k population. ranks 35th among US states, they're rising  Again, I'm saying things happening. know are. I'm saying I'm buying ""vast majority"" people eating restaurants, going bars, having/attending weddings, throwing/attending large parties etc. 

Polling back basic Lakers championship accurate. calculations that‚Äôs 1/5 current testing per capita United States. comparable testing per capita US late April attest neck woods. People flying streets. Well try think something doctor stock. order mine Internet. Absolutely way that's true. There's supply shortages caused shutdown. There's lot people losing freedom enjoy lives, lot people losing earning money negatively impact freedoms, amount people literally dying economic shutdowns negligible. can't argue otherwise without disingenuous. I‚Äôm drug overdoses way result Covid 

The drug supply disrupted. far toxic pre-covid.  can‚Äôt know everything right away new virus. sorry loss can‚Äôt imagine pain you‚Äôre going through. sounds like wonderful human world needs of. Social distancing bothered all.  significant hang though. We've rather enjoyed it. mask thing normal me. Like wearing shoes. Given article clear motive paranoid outlook, evidenced focus funding drawn (an organization bankrolls _vast_ array labs schools research _all_ kinds), you‚Äôre far off.

For anyone downvoting this, consider - entire article ad hominem? isn‚Äôt robust, scientific dispassionate refutation proposal itself?

Have even studied Barrington document? sincerely tried understand consider merits Epidemiologists Stanford, Oxford, Harvard behind suggesting why?

If haven‚Äôt done that, you‚Äôre anti-science climate change denier. Science doesn‚Äôt subscribe ideology, else it‚Äôs compromised default. 

If haven‚Äôt vigorously steel-manned (opposite straw-man) sides making mind, dont informed opinion all. talking points sound informed. LOL wow, men predictable. fragile.

Whatever. winning. male leaders country 1.4 billion, scale totally different. So, I've told: chains south florida offer PCR testing 2-3 day turnaround day antigen testing. insurance symptoms covid generally cost.

If wind getting test I'd interested hearing experience. need like 48 hr turnaround test, preferably Broward, travel couple weeks. I‚Äôm referencing fact comment simply asking evidence downvoted. I‚Äôm questioning validity article, wisdom making statement fact based limited evidence even bothering add links. people getting salty someone asks commenter back claim. IMO expected. I'm glad Lakers NBA Championships instead Heat. worry unrestricted championship celebrations Florida would resulted covid deaths.

Florida, sit ass down. I‚Äôve made masks 2 layers Cotton middle layer polypropylene moulded sheet. wear wash 60c soapy water. I‚Äôve made quite enables us this. 
But also don‚Äôt leave door without mask wear continuously get home. We‚Äôve done since March. News worth paying for. don‚Äôt, business model longer related informing you. oh reality. Look cases Europe right now. Governments much. People stupid.  ever read article posted? single PCR thermocycler 384-wells (one reaction) PCR takes 2-4 hours IIRC. 1000 thermocyclers means 384000 tests 2 hours, 3200 tests per minute. commercial lab used work around 20 thermocyclers. everyone works 12 hour shifts 50 labs area, possible.

But no, easy. SurprisedPikachu.png ""Covid caused those"" wrong, ""they happened Covid"" true? Yikes. know ability prevent deaths, yet WANT people die Nazi-inspired ideal humanity must purge weak. 

Thanks letting us know! Oh, excellent! Thanks! did
She 38 good health time. took foster kid time time neglected guardians needed temp housing. believe caught kids asymptomatic. worst part it‚Äôs done poor parents. Part died see everyday worry diabetic. Thanks kind words! ahaha lol, like Al Gore built internet?! Lol whoops. saying US fudge numbers?  real miracle US American leaderps really seem think sovereign debt bite. 

Imperial Spain every bit arrogant back day. wilted apart within generation. good. worked decade Argentina. could even work US generation. it'll stop working everything fubar Since wanna make gender, there's female politicians heads retarded men are. Equality all. even read person said? weren‚Äôt licking Trumps boot all, anything opposite saying China better. know say? Actually think profited greatly _unavailabilty_ PPE... Basically taking entire healthcare industry ""federal prison pound a"" ride gravy train. true? getting Covid somehow guarantee also catch pneumonia? Yes, although high number people - say 80% - feel like nothing, also high number people wish never caught it. Hard people smart wrap heads around. worry NZ... States keep seasonal flu alive. Guaranteed. friend owns body shop. Slowed alot due less ppl road. School one? think loop. meant exhaust, consider influx disinformation [bad arguments. method arguing ideological virus society. Pushed fascists, perpetuated rich fascists, consumed+adopted idiots. idea knowledge attack. Good ol' Confirmation bias strikes again. noted article preprint peer-reviewed. see, checks bit ironic, no? crazy high amounts undiagnosed cancer, suicides, domestic abuse, preventable medical deaths, tons shit,

This exactly article talking about...Redditors read articles though. straight understand words mean, think means wise. That's another thing pisses off. many right-wingers completely ignoring fact people left damaged organs survive inital infection. fuck talking about??? haven‚Äôt even thought Walgreens CVS I‚Äôll try cal tomorrow see deal was. whole giant covid testing tent people could get drive though covid test would mail results. lasted 2 weeks early pointless. Yes. 10-4 that. Early voting starts week TX! Died ‚Äúwith‚Äù COVID ‚Äúof‚Äù COVID. TWO DIFFERENT THINGS. Exactly. experienced plus probably larger pool sizes. one read here? 

Redditors read articles. Cuomo could acted sooner, don‚Äôt need rehash March. Already deaths Florida Texas combined. ""working Darwin Award"" sounds like bullet point CV.   I‚Äôm sorry sister, pass due virus? appreciate that, much love wherever friend. Surgical masks country can't trusted flooding China low quality masks. use triple layer cotton mask 5 layer 2.5pm filter insert. Makes 8 layer mask. Although carrying something 2 flights stairs struggle. chain pharmacies testing florida? I'll need get rapid test somewhere South Florida couple weeks travel. I've lead believe easy maybe that's right? He's borne ilk fallen con.

This cringey read. Oof.  People fighting nail tooth wear mask don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs problem availability willingness. Unfortunately sizable amount people alone anti vaccine probably WS initiative itself, already see uproar also promoted continued social distancing well vaccine. Warp Speed appearance COVID coming end opinion get people actually accept it. Happy cake day  people won‚Äôt getting vaccine, even one. don‚Äôt blame either. yeah. Yeah, really care read faked concerns listed conspiracy theorist looking ways cling No, that's IQ. Well one thing consider that‚Äôs true matter time look at:

When driving one lane road. bottleneck slowest driver there‚Äôs multiple cars road once. fastest driver inevitably catch slowest driver given enough time distance.

So explains you‚Äôd experience aggressive drivers rear you‚Äôre someone hovers closer speed limit. 

Now I‚Äôm curious coincidence there‚Äôs uptick it‚Äôs anecdotal us experiencing unique driving experiences indivual daily commutes. something caused it? 

Is pandemic? Trump? politics general? Climate change? feels like much happened year. see one reasonably assume crazy events 2020 contributes modification driving behavior. Really would like know exactly well. hear ya man. It‚Äôs like yellin rocks. Feels helpless protect ones love. wish could done , hope brother stays healthy ! mean heart Well yes people view 'getting back normal' wearing masks. Sorry. Masks going away time soon. probably shouldn't. like asia. Think sick? Wear mask. Japan shit ton elderly flu flu death rates way lower us.

Like hey. guess what..modulo dine eatting movies, get 80% wearing masks. number closer 260,000 200,000. surprising tbh, seems like effort report since began. post removed cannot verify reliable source.

Unfortunately, Mexico definitely severely undercounting COVID-19 victims, point contact tracing anymore similarly reopened prematurely like neighbors north.


Same bad temptation sacrifice lives almighty economy.  Like think you‚Äôve heard someone laughing, think heard scream mean, trouble friggin piece face cloth? Plus, last time checked, much say ‚Äútheir right‚Äù refuse masks, also RIGHT wear damn mask. (Not mention, masks hurting anyone; were, CDC wouldn‚Äôt telling people wear first place) want wear mask, right so. respect opinions, even they‚Äôre different mine, won‚Äôt even me? Yeah, fuck noise. (Mind you, I‚Äôm mad you, I‚Äôm still pissed nonsense deal night) Let tell this. Chinese government like brag capable are. usually report impressive numbers. shits go execute orders. test kit 30% accuracy. contract often given companies whose main shareholders government top officials. even positive case, simply don‚Äôt report it. know standard new case patient must show symptoms. patient showed symptoms, count him/her even result positive. prob cases isolated one city/area. sometimes they‚Äôre obesity which, America... well ya know. Australia. Although covid deaths NZ also low flu numbers Winter folks actually pandemic cannonball run and, predictably, broke previous record. resonates me, sorry bud. brother who‚Äôs diabetic special needs already feel like society shuns people like out, making disgusted lot people. COVID situation, feel even disgust. Obviously amazing loving people world, man, others, awful case COVID, assholes could easily spread someone won‚Äôt walk away this. September 24th reported 2 dock workers gotten infected contaminated food shipment. 

No changes made October holiday 400 thousand people travelled city.

Now reporting 12 new cases community spead. interesting see happens next. would think car accidents would down, rates shot neck woods due people driving like maniacs instead

I forget vancouver portland signs comparing many people killed year versus last year motor vehicle incidents like 18 vs 22 notable massive. 

Personally, hardly drive anymore I'm starting feel rusty amazing even feel rusty learn walk I'm starting  statement fact links supporting articles isn‚Äôt *hypothesis*


Thats referencing.

The article linked examination increases stroke incidences younger patients. evidence new (and somewhat small sample) data, hypothesized ([definition] reasons they're seeing cases taken cdc website directly shows 250k-280k deaths (from sources) amounts 2017-2019 week 36 (First week September) trend looking deviate even higher. Feels like enraged people often similar attributes..  around really think meth alcohol. like driving kill, swear Bear mind posted like May first state release up-to-date monthly vital statistics.

This might help, COVID19 deaths passed one million globally recently, estimated 10% population infected. might also surprised learn outside America also think it‚Äôs pandemic, didn‚Äôt give toss Trumps re-election chances became concerned it‚Äôs serious disease.

American politics aren‚Äôt big deal outside America. pay wall thanks know downvoted? Covid definitely flu. fucked. personally know anyone died cancer, went around saying ""cancer hoax everyone dumb realize it"", would deserve got punched mouth US second England testing per capita take tiny countries like Iceland et al. I‚Äôd recommend least slightly informed comment... misinformation spreads everything I've read unlikely. usually days. September 23rd. Still action 8 months later. Perhaps something 2024 give another 4 years think response. Uncle Joe 75, obese, bad heart doe Covid-19 becauss obese, old, bad heart?

I either/or. TN teacher here. Admin even wearing masks. Like, come on, even pretense trying protect anyone. got bleach wipes masks. crisis illustrates utter failure system, society. I‚Äôm sorry insults exact person cause frustration. I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs mess ups people ridiculous say isn‚Äôt deadly. Even article posted said it‚Äôs unclear wether death got taken not. like article states there‚Äôs probably way deaths aren‚Äôt marked down. People wanna read rare articles blow proportion feel better virus. worst thing covid changes symptoms person person. people almost symptoms. Others get strokes nerve damage it. people get mild symptoms. people collapse die blue. people get slowly progressing/worsening symptoms. fucking random strange. risk all!? even take chance it. 

If going outside around people meant 60+% chance shattering every bone body would go around people? Pleas act like anything Republicans shitheads != yet, children responding virus. seem aware immunological studies SARS-2. happened anywhere else? Please tell referring field morgues... go home. Stay SD, get covid, recover go home. 

Or go home, quarantine go exactly think foundation does? whole fucking goddamn point help situations like this. response is, ""Why anything (insert issue)!?"" 

It work everyone, gets people talk logical fallacies least. No. government compensate you. July, guess excuess extend holiday. understand people temperate warmer regions flocking idea.

Because told virus exist, hoax make President look bad. they, astonishingly, believed it. denial truth, spite fact mainstream media vilify it, equally dangerous. Great Barrington Declaration hero deserve, one need right now. continue hunt it, take it. continue vilify it, hero. silent guardian. watchful protector. real world, Great Barrington Declaration Dark Knight. *cackles pneumonic plague* Actual doctors agree loads people dying delaying care due shutdowns, co-workers far truth said primary means addressing pandemic right one said otherwise since started.  mean lockdowns ever.  Seriously fucking stop. Thank you, appreciate that!

Reviewing list, however, one see really standing might make people 'concerned' injury one, accounts 3% deaths. Personally really call 'inflating' numbers certainly turn around say 'only 6%' actually died COVID-19. 'Co-morbidity' - *co*, means death attributed one other. 

If Uncle Joe obese gets covid dies, die 'only' obese. seems like useful member society. Want come seek asylum Australia? dysautonomia brought serious bout flu.

I, too, think we'll see big increase illnesses due covid. really sucks people, hope silver lining attention research given disorders. Maybe they'll better experiences did. Spent decadin military including several years warzones naval ships.

You wrong. understand number viruses exposed seems make difference. exposed lot coronaviruses, like somebody without mask sneezed close range, seems produce worse case exposed viruses. Like might get filtered piece cloth, something. read rolling vaccine? really large p3 trial? still wonder virus spread people test positive, likely White House staff, press people, leadership President kept secret allowing spread. still talk tested positive first. well people exposed failed take precautions failed alert people near take precautions. Thank you. want bring light causes suffering. many turmoil right now, small part directly covid itself. suffering sucks! need balance policies. CDC found actually death toll covid much much much much lower. People underlying conditions always susceptible viruses.   absolutely know go away immediately election, really needed first place strong leadership acting unified voice give strategy keep people safe. got instead President used pandemic way polarizing yet another aspect lives, anyone trying safe deemed ""one them!""

So no, think go away immediately election, hope election removes one person caused us politicize pandemic make poor decision poor decision. Maybe least start listening medical experts' advice. Obedience nothing it.  Gates saying wrong? wrong, back shut fuck up. Yes. many mink costs own? frequently purchase mink oil? read CDC literally said instead editorial random guy Miami?

Only 6% people actually died Covid itself.

The rest happened Covid died. That‚Äôs Black Death Also high lethality disease easy take seriously. ""halfway"". Lol right pub, might well. profit ppe. tried early phases. Vaccines treatments real money is. It‚Äôs clearly flu, it‚Äôs different virus. 

Unless test everyone world, CFR never close IFR. fact remains 40% people catch covid never even show symptoms. people ‚Äúsurvive‚Äù lifelong health problems. actually look specific cases, vast majority lasting effects typically rough shape even got sick. Severe obesity, cancer, heart disease, etc etc. 

What know data disease affects healthy humans (not overweight obese, comorbidities). might deadlier especially vulnerable subset population, looking data flu actually dealdly healthy adults children. It‚Äôs already weak deadly. need precise handle disease va taking blanket approach wasting resources destroying economy. Seriously stop posting bullshit.  making look stupid. I‚Äôll bet I‚Äôll bet. still counting car accidents gun shots long deceased covid time? Good, gas fear machine!  private entity profits work. Care post one? numbers CDC showing it‚Äôs likely ~60k additional deaths cure plague, antibiotics. Unfortunately, can't cure contain stupidity.  witnessing mass extinction event. stopped trying change behavior others. become far strict quarantine since March. bought N95 masks people life love harass taking Vitamin D, melatonin, vitamins. protect people love. 

Everyone else, point, own. someone STILL isn‚Äôt social distancing wearing mask, asking it. natural selection works. stubborn stupid culled; tragically taking countless others them. You‚Äôd think people would straight violent anti-maskers point - they‚Äôre murderers. Fuck em. 28 people died Canada yesterday. LET SINK IN. think maybe see death rate trend returns years, see definite spike interpolate there. Imagine desperate people frightened use scary word like ‚Äúsurvival,‚Äù put fatality rate less normal flu. 7 new confirmed cases Hong Kong yesterday.

Contact tracing details three asymptomatic carriers Qingdao areas Qingdao closed management. Full population PCR test way, far 114,000 tested, negative.

Update: 6 confirmed cases 6 asymptomatic carriers found, far 200,000 tested. SHEESH. u quit? do. come lockdowns. guess misinformed well? matter covid died jumping building afterwards. Covid reason died. Ugh. imagine frustrating must been, good sticking principles. mean say **9,935** number get deduct **total reported COVID deaths** reported **Total Deaths** **17,163.**

So, basically, **7,800** might peak total deaths since 2017, right?

Well, shatter record, even deducting deaths reported COVID?

Obviously, least **2,135** deaths also due COVID, reported such.

This every baby boomer know kept repeating story friend friend whose mother died natural causes, falsely reported COVID. I'm afraid anecdotal evidence much use everyone else, especially even read article. Modern health care medicine contain plague easily, can‚Äôt contain stupid.

Thank goodness count strong elected leadership guide us safely! see idiots online commenting ‚Äúbut many people *actually* died Covid?‚Äù I‚Äôm going say ‚Äúhow many people *actually* lost jobs Covid? really lost jobs employer let go.‚Äù pneumonia got covid? Interesting take. I‚Äôm skeptical Covid back then. Patient 0 believed begun showing symptoms Nov. 

Air quality US particularly bad late last year, suspect real culprit behind pneumonia spike Hard get data yet. lot fully reported. get full death count swine flu many years Yes I'm hoping people longer go work send kids school sick anything contagious. would awesome. THIS! I've screaming deniers months!  Yes is. Bruh. click buttons come comparison like. super easy. going CDC said.

Or source mean find actual source inside stanford? Thats effort posts sub combined. Billionaires gained like $350B since pandemic started. 

I mean maybe would gained $750B pandemic, IDK. really feeling burden IMO. They're still getting richer get poorer. 

Just look stimulus package. $2.2T big corporations like $200B everyone else. Despite Corporations paying less half taxes, representing (I think) half jobs. got 11x much stimulus.  That's 35% more! 

Things make go ""hmmmmmm"": case I'm going ""hmmmmmm wonder real numbers places like Brazil India?""

Really wouldnt suprised real figures 3rd world countries 10 times that. Like charities run ultra wealthy individuals, lower tax bill: lengthy read, well worth it. Oh see site done another piece charitable work: selfish self-isolate. Hell, might even responsible since risking exposing anybody else going test. 

Good luck buddy. can't draw perspective objective data, that's sad bit. contextually relevant helpful trying understand full situation area, necessary making decisions individual macro level. example, cases drop area, can't say situation improving based alone. testing went way down? need either percent positive and/or testing volume change time know sure (either one could used figure other). 

So taking example. Say area 5 million population reports 500 daily cases. great, bad. Suddenly 2 week period cases rise 1000 day. Oh no, sky falling, we're gonna die. Except oh wait, increased testing 2 weeks. used 5000 tests day 10% positivity certain focus testing sick people, they're testing tons asymptomatic people finding asymptomatic cases covid. they're 20000 tests day 2.5% positivity. reality, spread virus probably change much area 2 weeks, looking testing volume and/or percent positive, think increasing rapidly making uninformed decisions. people like people mentioned study people! CDC guideline maximum people gather still 10 number changed? google title click through, might hit paywall.

That worked me. surprising since GOP member demonstrate time time care really care people, themselves. India catching pretty quickly 13 days old article.. Yep. Ancient. still counts study put graphs reports Welcome Sweden. strategy 10-fold difference deaths/capita Stockholm region fewest deaths it‚Äôs kinda obvious shouldn‚Äôt run one strategy country. media's approach virus change Nov 3, sheep follow it. governments found tests enough contact-tracing staff follow plan action.**

Western governments often enough testing, can't contact trace sorts can't contact trace 150,000 - 300,000 human interactions Wednesday, Thursday.

It's nice theory, work sort scale.

We need recognise 'cases'/positive tests impacts hospitalitisations deaths April/May  know traffic ED significantly reduced LONG time - people still heart attacks, strokes, CKD etc scared go hospital. Source: I‚Äôm hospital based NP Los Angeles Luxembourg excess mortality wasnt high (compared countrys)

It still highest since 1975, dont know compare years back population 50% smaller. (and gave us total numbers)

The years highest excess deaths (without first years war) still 1956, 57, 69, 75.

The governement says 133 people died covid indeed covid 19 deaths. (because easier count small country)
I believe Luxembourg impossible hide something, would cases people died houses without covid test, everybody would know it. (here everyone knows everyone)

I still dont understand still well pandemic (compared neighbours example) mean one first countries central europe reopened country didnt introduce new restrictions since months.

Gyms opened since may, well bars, Restaurants, nightclubs, schools etc.

And yes masks mandatory (already since april) governement gave us (and 200k frontuer workers) 55 masks per person. (over 6 years) July.

&amp;#x200B;

Tate Reeves 65th Governor talk herd immunity. I‚Äôve listened people argue rapid spread cases good thing, need reach herd immunity Mississippi elsewhere survive. I‚Äôm health care expert means, math guy. thoughts: 

The experts say need 70-80% population get COVID-19 achieve herd immunity. Let‚Äôs assume they‚Äôre wrong (it‚Äôs certainly possible, before.) Let‚Äôs assume they‚Äôre way overly cautious actually need 40% infection herd immunity. 

In Mississippi, population 3 million. We‚Äôve 36,680 cases far. 


We‚Äôd need 1.2 MILLION infections achieve hypothetical 40% threshold. (Remember, experts say it‚Äôs double that.) 

Over last two weeks, hospital system started become stressed point pain. seeing early signs effects becoming overwhelmed. suspend elective surgeries again. 

On worst day new cases, 1,000. typically 700-900 aggressive time. 


To get 40% infections, we‚Äôd need 3,187 new cases every day full year today. 


We would need TRIPLE worst day‚Äîevery day‚Äîfor year. 

I‚Äôm one guys immediately dismisses idea challenges expert status quo talking points. I‚Äôm pretty skeptical nature. That‚Äôs healthy. herd immunity anything like realistic solution short mid-term. wish was. 

Unless you‚Äôre willing go without hospitals car wreck heart attack, need different approach. Right now, despite mixed messages beginning, seems like masks best bet. They‚Äôre hell lot better widespread shut downs. Please wear one! Thanks.I thinking winter also flu season. DC like dozen cases day going get information piece vile shit. It‚Äôs 30ish medical centers virologist geniuses working this. don‚Äôt accept opinion based single word‚Äôs impact interpretation young adults. can‚Äôt help stupid. that. HS friend dumbass.

....looks spectacular i'm sitting (US) ""Woolf says deaths indirectly caused pandemic came illnesses *Alzheimer's disease, diabetes heart disease*, sharply increased five states recorded COVID-19 deaths. 

Delayed care, fear seeking care emotional crises stemming pandemic could also contributed deaths, says, well inaccurate death certificates may misidentified COVID-19 death.""

I get it, die COVID-19 ""*Alzheimer's disease, diabetes heart disease*"" die seek medical help, lack medical help caused pandemic? many people deathly sick prior pandemic? trust scientists due diligence raise alarm bells see something suspicious.

We‚Äôre 10 months pandemic alarm bells raised.

I think high chance reinfection, we‚Äôd see least frontline healthcare workers infected multiple times. haven‚Äôt.

Lol blatant. Post link stfu Testing widespread 1st quarter year. know people getting virus got once? Someone may got January/February US testing extremely restricted/unavailable &amp; got recently recent infection counting official tally. obviously even factor asymptomatic infections. shall see plays out. Hopefully reinfection remains rare enough need concerned it. asked Gates Foundation great everyone thinks is:  control started full nationwide 2-month-long lockdown. think we'd done nothing all, would hit around 500-1000 deaths/million hitting herd immunity, based looking various countries worldometer, i.e. Sweden, 

Sweden doesn‚Äôt herd immunity though 600 dead per million US herd immunity.

We counted 210k dead (and count 663 dead per million) near 300k dead based excess deaths.

So think done nothing would roughly amount deaths herd immunity.

Yeah? Well, don‚Äôt know single person died car accident, heart attack, lung cancer. fake death counts well?

There's plenty evidence they're undercounting Drs marking enough people Covid dying Covid. Developing countries don‚Äôt capabilities deal lockdowns first place ‚Äî lack wealth so. Stronger world economies capabilities combat ‚Äî like done much Europe, North America, Asia, parts world. It‚Äôs incomparable.

In this, I‚Äôm quite positive good amount Africa done little nothing stop ‚Äî ‚Äî is. South America got battered this. lack organization economies handle pandemic. Testing positivity rates Argentina roof, Peru come said letting run course. There‚Äôs point throw hands air. nation far ‚Äî it‚Äôs pompous attitudes citizens curving rights that‚Äôs issue.

My country literally shut businesses month curb congregations people *still* didn‚Äôt/doesn‚Äôt stop families groups friends getting together ‚Äî despite fact nation *literally* creating money funding pandemic response. Hundreds billions far. *[fine individuals]* distanced, could economy replenishing it‚Äôs losses. However, there‚Äôs little care many interrupts lives.

Another reason US (wealthiest nation world) absolute capabilities control disperse information supplies ‚Äî can‚Äôt tell significant amount population wear masks ‚Äúain‚Äôt told free country‚Äù logic bleeds border many cases. *zero* cross-border action unless it‚Äôs strictly economy actual essential work. 

The Canadian-US border, worlds longest unmanned border, locked down. can‚Äôt many countries. significant differences. absolutely first world privilege haven‚Äôt gotten control yet. Everyone feels liberties trumped despite fact country hemorrhaging money get control. nations don‚Äôt luxury citizens taking granted. It‚Äôs shame.

Clearly didn‚Äôt get main point post ‚Äî well-educated, well-informed individuals followed proper guidelines would handled like New Zealand. Which, capability do. lying behalf CCP save face need doctor webmd facebook? read along rest know? early finding huge spike dead people homes thought died ‚Äúheart attacks‚Äù, never tested Covid. learning deaths fact Covid related. problem incredibly pathetic testing system country has.

How come people proudly ignorant? Jesus thats awful im sorry. option? Compare pandemic natural disaster (which is). People stop shopping hurricane mandatory evacuation order, hurricane!
 would insane reopen shops live normally event. People would normally go afraid getting hurt. 

However storm stopped governments. government works stop disaster, implementing policies reduce spread, disaster end, least substantially reduce risk. turn convince people safe resume shopping demand increase. Seems like next step progression idiocracy Educational settings main driver. highest age group cases 16-24 followed high school age. combination undertesting spread. 38% matter spin terrible number. thankfully. lived health issues im sure didnt help didnt get much. may even covid synthoms. Also thank you. Figure many people die per time different times year normal times. Look many died since COVID started. Subtract get ""excess deaths""


It counts everyone might died directly catching COVID, died changes society operates due COVID.  single news source consumers. 
 
I friends religiously quote Joe Rogan primary source goddamn *news* audacity call sheep reading Associated Press Reuters.
 
What hell  completely agree Since China South Korea basically every first-world Asian country practicing herd immunity?

People misled purpose lockdowns trying correct that. UN says: kids, dont morons

Sad news Well know came Facebook MUST true! Belgrade Serbia though. Dude, normal person reads headline assumes increase mortality rate COVID. know this, know this, everyone thread knows expected probably intended reading headline. get playing dumb something? holly shit.. sounds like HAES movement. bet ven diagram intersects. mean CDC run Donald Trump literally tried convince us masks bad? Yeah fuck them. 

And he's piece shit regardless guidelines. apologize him. New account Unfortunately no, although via genome sequencing determined almost definitely came across border (as opposed community since first outbreak). Possibly got quarantine process somehow, knows. Bismuth one main ingredients, even store brands. tears blood stream, maybe would. No, not. referring things like people able receive treatment issues would needed hospital care for, could receive lack people/facilities take care due spike Covid cases. Comments like make sick. herd immunity mentality side eugenics... oh weak co morbidities okay die..for economy selfish entitled New account Probably much hoping. Democratic districts still higher death rates infection rates. completely due politics though. areas highest rates also tend poorer, minority, less educated areas. also guess says something politics area.

www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/05/26/coronavirus-death-toll-is-heavily-concentrated-in-democratic-congressional-districts/%3famp=1 read Florida govenor said sat could pack stadium....that 5 days ago follow European country COVID data worldometer.

I say high chance Czechia coronavirus cases highly underreported.

Why? Epidemiology clear: roughly 1% cases die. little higher lower depending specifics might happen sustained large cases number, expect huge deviations.

If want know country deal, pick 7 days average cases, divide 100 close decease numbers 2-3 weeks.

Issue Czechia 15-20 days ago roughly 1500-2000 7 days average cases. mean 15-20 7 days average fatalities today.

And (not counting today's data) 37, roughly double expected... that's way much :S. Sure. I'm saying leadership making effort stop jobs, mean effort across every level.

Doctors field gonna list cause death COVID think COVID confounding factor. state live similar population New Zealand. less cases Covid less deaths virus. yeah there‚Äôs flu season too. avoided stage 4 lockdowns New Zealand too. talked Uighurs life. college fine new one. read like this. 

‚ÄúI fool, can‚Äôt correlate two paragraphs institution doctor. failed state exams, know difference without!‚Äù

It sounds like you! Brain-dead!  Sweden Netherlands places restrictions citizens stop COVID, saying otherwise like pretending NYC nothing lot deaths occurred nursing homes. South Korea lucky. practically live island already well organised I‚Äôm sure Catholics don‚Äôt like seeing ‚Äúpenetrates‚Äù ‚ÄúVatican‚Äù sentence. still dont understand still well pandemic

I guess testing. tested EU member state total 1.4 million tests per million inhabitants. That's almost twice Denmark's rate 7 times France's. case numbers appear high, actually finding mild/asymptomatic cases contact tracing keeping prevalence low. 

Also lucky hit badly first wave, antibody surveys May showed 2.7% prevalence.

Not densely populated metro area mass transit system ( like paris /london/brussels) probably helped lot too. Yep. Medical degrees matter convenient. antivax SIL posted something Bill Gates medical degree commenting vaccines. Facebook moms reads day, totally fine medical degrees. Dexmethazone(sp) improves mortality 6-8%
Antibodies even more.
There‚Äôs yet one silver bullet. surprising!

Taken Trump cocktail, might treatment actually works... available least super wealthy. don‚Äôt want hunker inside much longer either, sub complete loony bin Goddam it.... I've wrong whole time. Florida hits 2 weeks since Ron Desantis declared end covid restriction mask rules

florida today +1870 new cases. \~90 deaths (7 day moving average).

florida two weeks ago 1882 cases. \~103 deaths (7day moving average). Sooo no, make big difference. Cases deaths continued trend slightly downward.

lockdown/mask loving People's republic Califorina 3114 cases 66 deaths yesterday. no, lockdowns make difference

Source join right facebook group it'll tell everything. ignore mountains evidence people know died? burst bubble COVID scarcely affects people power economy. 

By time 70 plus, generally bought last house, car, major appliance etc.

So premise mostly wrong.  wonder infection rate BLM rioters Lakers Championship partiers are? here‚Äôs Texas A&amp;M last Saturday Deff breaking masks rules looked Canada good, America bad. That's why. Try link: Exactly. Going real - June, wore mask 100% time went coffee shops, grocery stores, etc. night, made incredibly stupid decision go bar friend. packed one wearing masks, that's probably got COVID diagnosed two weeks later. super embarrassed would tell friends family would always wear mask idea could gotten it. I'm sure makes little shitty true people tell truth whatever reason. always make best art they're hungry.""

That's actually pretty funny. Mean jokes often funny generally. nineteen people, forty-two deaths US, died carbon monoxide poisoning Hurricane Laura considered hurricane related. I'm sure would say hurricane actually kill them, opposed people dying falling trees flying debris drowning.

With understand people saying deaths virus possible cancelling millions medical appointments public avoiding hospitals led number preventable deaths. No, I'm not. can't imagine much *unpackaged* food goes people's fridge beyond leafy greens. rate, specifically saying use alcohol food.

It seems confusion thread stems assumption posters talking talking washing naked raw unpackaged food alcohol soap.

Is saying.

We talking things like bottles, jars, boxes, bags. Clean naked food best water, maybe vinegar. Maybe part confusion brought vinegar means breaking coatings produce... That's fine, that. poster meant, want reiterate anybody intends use vinegar disinfectant, going anything kill virus. Though concede possible point help remove debris (and thus possible viral contaminants) produce. 

I'm pedantic possible, people get wrong idea telling put soap lettuce. thing go food food. Wash needs go fridge. non-perishables packaging, sit days using them. Many things sold refrigerated marked ""refrigerate opening,"" may stored safely room temperature opened, advise people make use knowledge. Many baked goods handle two three weeks going stale bad depending heat humidity area, things like loaves bread muffins sit theoretical grocery box brought several days use them. Shelf-stable produce like oranges, apples, potatoes, onions stick grocery box couple days like said... nervous produce infected, cook 165 first avoid raw, that's literally do. world we're going live next 8 months, I'm sure tell you. Judging downvotes comments recently seems like came aswell maybe someone linked sub groups, army bots. Either way tone around changed lot recently. Ah, would better. seemed like one highest days, looking worldometers track positivity there. That‚Äôs true. read meme Facebook group too. Also - FACEBOOK EVIL. Oops made üò≥ shit. It‚Äôs like person heart condition, contracts Covid dies. Welp go, heart condition. every single underlying condition Covid exacerbated enough kill person. no, it‚Äôs Covid. it‚Äôs underlying condition.

How hell could know going on?

And course Covid never death certificate. country playing ostrich Covid beginning extent find staggering.

JFC immunocompetent individuals according publications. one strain sars-cov2. Reinfection endemic common cold coronaviruses norm, one? ton evidence can‚Äôt build lasting immunity infection coronaviruses general. make up?  Key West/Monroe county pretty closely mirrored state mandates; reopening bars brought rise cases 2-3 weeks after. 

Ultimately we're screwed here, we're incredibly dependant upon high volume tourism, economy collapse without it. 

Yet, covid. I'm sorry. suggest coconut water frequently given chemo patients. Yeah, who's going click *that?* True. Also, horrible messaging far don‚Äôt think would handle publicity better. don‚Äôt answer calls don‚Äôt recognize I‚Äôm conspiracy theorist. 

Also still way many cases contact trace. really think icu beds filled covid patients? 

Illinois. 

377 icu covid patients. 3793 total beds. Covid patients 9.9% 
1129 non covid patient‚Äôs using icu beds. non covid patients 29%
1503 total patients icu. 39% beds used icu. 


Yeah. hospitals overrun covid patients. 3 times many people non covid reasons. grandmother died April. ill got sent hospital early wasn‚Äôt enough beds covid patients. Died night falling. lots deaths like this, sadly. ü§£ü§£ü§£ praised Xi? unaware final judge character, know. Appreciate insight! linear final destination like  Icu nurse here. actually started last travel contract tail end virus peak. next weeks hooooooolllyyy moly super super super sick non-COVID related deaths. 15 bed ICU one night 5 people die 24 hour period 2 Covid related. LOT ICU size. Ok they‚Äôre protesting restrictions lockdowns. What‚Äôs point? Maybe old Mayan thing allow crowd kill members losing team. question vague lol. think lack mask wearing, people still going every day life like there's virus, &amp; schools &amp; universities session again. cases started going schools &amp; universities opened school year.  Yeah, called Russian Troll Farm. 75,000,000 loud Americans give shit *lockdown death toll Arizona experts AZ's top universities providing Governor info rise COVID state, modeling, etc. 

They FREE. volunteering public benefit. Governor got rid Ducey tossed significant piece data ‚Äì public health models predict could headed toward disaster ‚Äì hours Ducey announced Monday he‚Äôs accelerating reopening parts state‚Äôs economy, state health officials told team university experts stop working models project happen universities‚Äô models shown way avoid dramatic spike cases delay reopening state end May.

Note that, turned out, scientists correct. work healthcare analytics many many examples physicians 'upcoding' they're treating try take advantage reimbursement contracts. idea core farfetched makes good conspiracy. Conceivably, could happening COVID diagnoses doubt there's anything systematically occuring would cause researchers vastly overstate COVID deaths like people claiming. 

But say happen doctors would lose medical licenses really based reality either. could totally happen. Objectively false It‚Äôs far behind cases per capita tho!! Still promoting pro American propaganda. genocide happening. main source guy runs Victims Com-muni-sm foundation. 5g, dont get that. anyone family get sick?

I'm sorry loss. Go vegan  really prevailing thought process amongst conservatives. Go subreddit, exactly they‚Äôre saying.

They don‚Äôt bring Facebook idea hospitals padded stats get Covid money supplies thus death matter small correlation Covid classified money fear. media helping Democrats liberals know win fear.

It‚Äôs weird say least.  Okay wait no. You‚Äôre making sense. one camp higher percentage concern places priority camp. Either way, cant really translate either percentage real life behavior influenced concerns unknowns. me, chart translates push getting back work spending money. states completely open zero restrictions experiencing little business closures revenue loss, assume demand. problem isn‚Äôt people afraid virus (and 60% whatever also encamping people expressing little concern), it‚Äôs restrictions. That‚Äôs analyze data. There's quite lot place, went term ""consensus"". something CDC talking 10x figure. news site listing number sources/opinions. also worth noting [IMHE seems think true infections 2-3x what's reported daily US (""estimated infections"" 115k daily currently), although credible source I've ever seen thinks low. So...only 4% better nothing mortality.

Unless I'm missing something, lot better 4%. depends exactly define ""% better"", every 15 people die without (according study), 4 would survived administered it---about 27% people.

Or, think way. perfect cure, numbers would 0% 15%. interpretation would 15% improvement. be, would 100% improvement. Maybe think inability pay fine flouting social distancing rules. Time lock every winter stop flu... trust anyone. Lancet horrible damage putting study killed HCQ trials retracting it. journals taking sides endorsing politicians. Instead politics becoming scientific, science become political. **divorced** neckbeards 

?? Save click- elderly woman form white blood cell cancer, would definitely impact immune system, unfortunately. economy also shit too, like everyone else completely false misinformation wonder infection rate Republicans males is? Yeah vulnerable parts population going ‚Äúcracking down‚Äù eating actually pay fines can‚Äôt afford. Nobody wins here. Oh multiple high risk groups. told ‚Äúultra high risk‚Äù lungs aren‚Äôt healthy enough fight anything super mild covid infection. guess get it? hoping January. depressing. Poor woman. Part issue still spread covid without symptomatic. one main reasons virus dangerous. That's likely because:

- Treatments getting better/quicker

- initial ""wave"" March/April several times larger new wave, cases lower due lower levels testing surely least one relative slightly overweight (it's obese - anything overweight considered health risk). 

Ask person die. Tell places like France, Netherlands etc.

Positive test =/= waves news, people heart attack often say exercise daily, people uncontrolled diabetes often say test blood sugar regularly, people morbidly obese often say eat right. Unpossible :) feel like it‚Äôs bad media makes there‚Äôs much misinformation going around fear mongering could wrong though don‚Äôt know clickbait trying imply connection two things. probably seem unbiased get people's true feelings. PBS, trust know asking questions way. Separate category, especially important post mortem studies going done. Industrial farming. sad thing people actually going take seriously  Nope. talking bare essentials lax quarentine even demonstrate that. (Which still enforced, night clubs opened clandestinely, business remained opened weeks end STILL open, even phase 1 situations)

You also evaded comment. gave tons examples quarentine effective, many showcase clear examples enforced.  Know know read article? Grasping straws. Post new link. say full crowd? I‚Äôm talking allowed Texas A&amp;M pretty packed. Also masks crowd shots games  bit second wait till January 75,000 deaths may indirectly cause pandemic, also wonder many deaths happen people driving less things could led untimely death push number higher. I‚Äôm thinking weren‚Äôt burdened overabundance schooling. don‚Äôt ignore ‚Äôtil go away. Jesus Christ thing? health advice politicised disrespected people think putting room full others danger ok....? choose dying Covid vs. cancer later would choose cancer later. talking point (and still remains) hugely part set Covid denial talking points.  People believe whatever fits narriatives.

The notion doctors willing risk medical licenses sake hospitals profits (nevermind sheer number moving parts would required coordinate this) never made sense whatsoever. Surgical-type masks ineffective protecting *you*. filter incoming air breathing designed to. 

They may value protecting others *from you* catching expired droplets.

If want protect *yourself*, wear respirator N95 mask, filters incoming air (very hard find now).

People need get straight. That's horrifying completely irresponsible.

People taking whole thing seriously keeps us hole. light end tunnel vaccine...which might years away. Masks save people covid. Here's packed, indoor crowd concert New Zealand 3 months ago.... got virus Sigh. need explain you? like. It‚Äôs problem. True. think different questions though clarity. Ok, show proof.  I'm afraid might happen mom.

She rare bacterial infection (with 50% mortality rate) quite sick. also can't eat much/vomits lot. (But excessive vomiting seem symptom others?)

She's several antibiotics, otherwise hospital take days, pump full potassium (its always low. vomiting?) send home again. 

She's getting thinner thinner. I'm afraid going die malnutrition hospital busy covid patients. 

Even though infection dangerous, feel like malnutrition worst her. body fight? gonna die starvation clear infection.

They want gain weight, far know (I live overseas) nutrition plan place. Ensure drinks whatever dad sister try feeding her. Anyone following know ""positivity rate"" ratio positive tests total tests.

True, they‚Äôve lied statements, guidelines often unscientific. see lack public trust, far know they‚Äôve never published false doctored data improved since early days pandemic  without cohesive, concerted governmental response, people mostly aware part help prevent spread  way, candidates full force production behind them, efficacy tests promising, military logistics specialists standby help distribution  evidence disease ravaging country, vaccine hesitation decreases  season might bad we've seen social distancing masking helped reduce flu transmission Southern Hemisphere winter &amp; people getting flu shots think deniers claiming 1% death rate believe reinfection, I'll go no.  Glenn jacobs anti mask since beginning.

Wow. think Bill Hicks would say ""it's irony base level, like it"" boo hoo. someone want fined follow rules nothing worry about. states going back normal right now, even vaccine, eventually states follow avoid triggering mass exodus. Agree 100%.

I wish media would focus prevention methods well. worry big pharma would rather people rely miracle drug whatever vaccine able pull out.

But wonderful examples preventative methods take. Pair methods mask wearing social distancing greatly lower chance getting sick getting serious illness get sick. Plus, eating well, sleeping enough, working help many mental health issues pandemic causing. really win-win strategy.

Before pandemic worked gym 2 - 3 times week, real workout plan goals, get fat. gym closed (it opened one month june closed cases spiked), I've working home 6 days week, workout routine, best shape I've ever in. Crazy global pandemic closed gyms would thing finally make become serious working out. choose take bus instead car can't opt pandemic, people following rules symptom fatigue, find way address NYT losing credibility days weeks go by, been, opinion, past 4-5 years. 

I remember started reading back 2011/12, really good even disagreed view points ... shadow used ... sad. Don‚Äôt feed trolls. think average age stroke victim somewhere 30s 40s. 

Glass houses friend. know that, Thanks! government allowed many hospitals close last 20 years got permanent lights fridge freezer? don't. Ok good news point view?

 talking people handling covid rules correctly sure bad. 

But talking ""police jobs"" good news they're actually jobs catching people. people hesitant break rules future. Could genetic factors people. genetic recessive trait connected toll receptor 7 limits body's ability see SARS-CoV-2 camouflage. results prone severe form disease. Also read recently Neanderthal genes chromosome 3 result risk getting severe form disease. add zinc, selenium vitamin deficiencies, thus people look ""healthy"" not, immune system-wise. love China tests residents region there's outbreak. probably effective way contain prevent Covid spreading. good news? means following rules helping spread disease. Also people probably can‚Äôt afford pay penalties pushed economic despair. February? happening. unless vaccine starts rolling November extremely unlikely.

/sigh I‚Äôm sure consider creating virus lab then. Let find articles then

The exact quote ‚ÄúUS researchers create strain researchers create strain coronavirus could used possible vaccine trials called human challenge experiments, Anthony S. Fauci, director National Institute Allergy Infectious Diseases, said interview generally [human challenge trials] don‚Äôt enough infections community given time get signal vaccine,‚Äù Fauci said. ‚ÄúUnfortunately us, don‚Äôt problem ‚Äî lot others repeatedly argued challenge experiments likely slower, ethically fraught harder scientifically interpret many people appreciate. takes months create coronavirus strains could used trials infect people. Fauci said viral strain would ready end year.

[US develops coronavirus strain human trials late stupid comment tbh one read here?

The r/ChurchOfCOVID need read. like growing plants, breeding animals? like farmers creating wheat tomatoes pork. Saying someone creating Covid-19 lab makes sound like making scratch, potential accidentally make something different. won‚Äôt test 30k people day? christ can‚Äôt understand paragraph text you? None even points, hypotheticals irrelevant main argument. Also, daily protests growing globe coronavirus restrictions. genuinely see that?

 Polls really suggest majority turning. engaging selective reasoning yes, playing game involves massive economic sacrifice making life miserable, realistic chance success, absolutely stop playing it. Otherwise you‚Äôre stuck ‚Äúsomething must/can done‚Äù phase mixed sunk costs fallacy keep going one day pay off, far damage good world right now

It's sunk cost still win, means something significant sustained 12-18 month pandemic. Globally clearly failed, countries succeeded come enormous cost still far soon say whether maintained, whether cost maintaining worth it. It‚Äôs also enormous risk, reason vaccine ineffective (fortunately seems unlikely).

South Korea's economy actually well compared others. sure get this. examples I‚Äôm given places like South Korea, New Zealand, Vietnam, closed borders almost immediately never allowed virus become widespread population. Congratulations them, clearly applicable 95% countries failed beginning faced sustained dispersed transmission many months. Suggesting could turn back clock try harder absurd. explained comment example China isn‚Äôt applicable non-authoritarian state, I‚Äôd gladly take many pandemics exchange freedom enjoy democracy.

Not sure think testing tracing never implemented. There's nothing technological otherwise preventing it. Youre simply say without finally, idea need ‚Äúbasic measures‚Äù political/public solve it. People hate restrictions daily life, every passing day economic pain restrictions becomes real, especially developing world. That‚Äôs say nothing spiritual social loss suspension nearly cultural activities social rituals. It‚Äôs delusional think people won‚Äôt push back that, every right to. massive sacrifices.

Polling U.S. indicates exact opposite. reason I‚Äôm passionate people genuinely believing anywhere could stop tried hard enough creates idea so, complicit responsible deaths. ignorant sentiment creates toxic atmosphere times already hard people suffering. don‚Äôt think adds anything discussion.

You're surprised people get mad thrown towel allowing hundreds thousands potentially die needlessly months leading vaccine? counting lot deaths caused virus Indirect consequences could include people afraid go hospital another condition fear catching coronavirus number issues caused exacerbated COVID-19‚Äôs economic mental health impacts, loss health insurance layoffs, inability afford medications pay cuts, skyrocketing rates depression America‚Äôs adults, condition negatively impacts many aspects health. can‚Äôt help use best adjectives describe extremely stupid managed become. fuck ya! fines! high school surveyed parents academic priorities coming year.

Most people think selfs others. That‚Äôs low estimate. people can‚Äôt seem civil keep politics discussion Yes, already know excess death due covid greater confirmed deaths. know 66-80% excess deaths due covid. good people following rules fined, incentivize follow rules future. time, people hearing ongoing enforcement going start following rules pre-emptively want fine. 

It's like fines wearing seatbelt bike helmet. Pop masks extra safe. otherwise, next best thing outdoors. government let lot hospitals close last 20 years miracle team wins white house, think go ahead outsource coronavirus fight China. least done right get with. never understood masks help. [...] got decent enough N99 mask

It might terminology. N99s technically ‚Äúrespirators‚Äù, understood surgical ‚Äúmasks‚Äù provide level protection N99 N95, inappropriate people think social distancing required wearing mask. However, order tell people buy respirators instead masks, would cause shortage doctors nurses. apologize correct. let lot hospitals close last 15 20 years. especially treated ER less profitable patients probably open borders second vaccine becomes available. going take months, years, virus disappears. They've taken elimination approach probably open borders countries eradicated it. [prime minister made clear refuse co-exist Goggles worn face shields..... Island nation 5 million thwarts virus.

Yeah deaths undercounted 20%ish, explained misreporting doctors, stated article linked. know CDC keeps excess death stats. cdc claim lying data. 

Hospitals may report death data cdc, also report data county. state compiles data counties publish it. Websites like Covidtracking.com worldometers.com pull data states (not cdc). cdc death count matches death count websites. 

There bit undercounting, see reason blame White House this. Hm that‚Äôs interesting way putting it. yes, burden falling onto poor. wealthy likely feel little effects poor get screwed many years come. Honestly April thought we'd mostly control end August.

good you:) study handy, believe despite in-home transmission one common ways transfer virus, still neighborhood 20 percent. say dad positive, statistically average 1 5 chance getting sick. mind, mask (everyone including him) try isolate limit unnecessary contact. Getting forgone conclusion. study actually titled Excess Deaths COVID-19 Causes, March-July 2020. 

Second last sentence says ""Excess deaths attributed causes COVID-19 could reflect deaths unrecognized undocumented infection severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 deaths among uninfected patients resulting disruptions produced pandemic."" auditioning 2024. Wait see happens SCOTUS ruling ACA. s/he come positive s/he might considered pre-existing condition, may lead possibly dropped insurance future. I'm almost impressed would imply leader administration actually cares sort immunity plan rather finding excuse downplay need action. Considering refuse explain refute reasonable counterpoint, I‚Äôm going assume don‚Äôt one. Good day lol

Edit: looking previous explanation seems don‚Äôt even understand I‚Äôm trying say. Maybe read little better lmao Next time, read article. Many excess deaths caused lockdown, Indirect consequences could include people afraid go hospital another condition fear catching coronavirus number issues caused exacerbated COVID-19‚Äôs economic mental health impacts, loss health insurance layoffs, inability afford medications pay cuts, skyrocketing rates depression America‚Äôs adults, condition negatively impacts many aspects health. means ""we much testing relative spread virus"". I'm guessing understanding nuance strong suit. Thank clarification. Though I‚Äôd still argue isn‚Äôt really ‚Äúcreating‚Äù virus lab.

And honestly long volunteers adults, fully explained risks, still willingly sign this, I‚Äôm sure issue it. course isn‚Äôt actual medical benefit there‚Äôs reason proceed, it‚Äôs sounding like won‚Äôt really know see results phase 3 trials. think ""unpossible"" good indication sarcasm.  word necessary. We've known since around ""May"" deaths significantly under-reported.

There nothing else significant able attribute variance deaths vs expected to. almost COVID. Unless someone come explanation almost 100k extra people died have, reason COVID, COVID.

I literally seen zero people put forth theory even attempt explain extra pneumonia deaths COVID deaths attributed symptom.

Everyone paying attention known whole time death count much higher reported. gonna reply going hide?


Here's another direct quote article, state exactly I'm saying. addressed issue head-on, think ""deflection"", perhaps post definition word, learn soemthing ‚ÄúExcess deaths include COVID deaths ascribed causes, ***as well indirect consequences pandemic society,‚Äù*** says.
Indirect consequences could include people afraid go hospital another condition fear catching coronavirus number issues caused exacerbated COVID-19‚Äôs economic mental health impacts, loss health insurance layoffs, inability afford medications pay cuts, skyrocketing rates depression America‚Äôs adults, condition negatively impacts many aspects health.

From research it, I've found PRK seems best way go reduce long term complications flap (but pain ASS beginning healing process). time take time work would've done that, regular LASIK problems anyways. never figured last outbreak came from? make reasonable estimates, CDC so.

Every year CDC puts statistics many people flu died flu, they're estimates. First lockdown implemented 450 ICU facebook appropriate place it. one mindset learning, entertainment distractions.

People want get back work normally able see family countries without losing days work due required quarantine. Wtf deal? Didn‚Äôt also warn ridiculous lockdowns? ignore fools sides coin say *feels* better blissfully ignorant, unjustifiably self confident. well adult years started listening people espousing, reading books, reason, logic, science. me, far terrifying, introduced lots self doubt, actually informed. I‚Äôm gonna report two accounts going lmao. desperate act though. applied logic retaining virus within Wuhan least, 9 million tests 12 cases

During earlier days testing severely bottlenecked, know dealing with. Remember *new* virus. paying attention, headline correct written. Lol what‚Äôs wrong going fridays.

You worked full week, feel completely exhausted hangout might want go home decompress. Biden pledged would shut country ""if science called it"" (Which fucking science? ones people dismissing without discussion label ""Right-wing conspiracy theorists""? Science monolith now?)

Gavin Newsom's guidelines fully re-open california absolutely beyond pale; LESS 1 case per 100,000 population? Positive rate less 2%? false positivity rate alone prevent that. insanity.

Cuomo's guidelines also draconian seem untenable. said New York businesses schools re-open anytime soon. 

The IFR COVID heavily age stratified. 50 years old, less 0.02%. worth shutting economy for?


Meanwhile, Ron Desantis Florida re-opened everything. Universal Disney open MONTHS end. Schools open. Businesses open, require masks inside. Hospitalizations deaths State peaked July flat declining ever since. 

So very, clear partisan divide re-opening. pains terribly, *absolutely despise* GOP everything do; agree this. cannot keep businesses operating. 

This preventing hospitals overloaded. Well, aren't. priority *get back normal* quickly possible. prevent people ever catching COVID ever again.

I care two things vote: SCOTUS, making sure things reopen again. SCOTUS lost. I'm left choice vote abomination clearly unfit serve office, someone might shut things destroy small business. already new treatments learned lot lowered mortality rate. likely months away least partially protective vaccine. Even good slow spread lower death rates, meaning even NZ eventually get hit virus, death rate much lower. Bit late party ok. Quoting article scientist extensive research pedestrians n=4. mean trying prove here. black white answer never said was. Anecdotal examples don‚Äôt prove anything. 

There rules first lockdown worked great. always work rules? No. never said that

People need a) believe cause matters b) believe helps stick rule. example pedestrians article fully imagine nr 2 apply.

If put sign front house says ‚Äòplease cover face passing house aesthetic reasons‚Äô one either.

Can sue Mike. know whether could work considering economy answer recognised one main reasons limited restrictions save it. could try question logic ethical standpoint; locked reason saving economy, also prevent compromised due weak immunity illnesses. would clean conscience superspreader, opening human activity would certainly ensure death suffering someone. Indirect consequences could include 

Yet again... **COULD** disclaimer negligible incidents accounted directly study.

In essence, someone tells plane COULD crash, saying plane definitely crash. That's reading comprehension issue.

While study found cases, part study. rule favour this, know likely isn‚Äôt regards science. Science still conflict this, even severe cases showing lung recovery 3-4 months can‚Äôt definitive said done. 

This done cash grab. October fest less opened up

Just it‚Äôs open, doesn‚Äôt mean people show numbers wants to. two poster children opening up, Various parts US Sweden, still worse effects economy places went lock down.

Opening bumper sticker, plan. achieves worse economic results lock down, deaths. They're fining people they're supposed help mitigate pandemic. fines going bankrupt regular person wearing mask. fines ones hosting gatherings establishing ignoring social distancing rules. Like 15k fine.

On schools reopening, they're everywhere new york. there's increase infections certain areas. schools can't main problem here. 


When talking hasidic community, they're ones responsible increase infections. That's communities targeted new lockdown. they're upset, took better precautions prevent increase infections.  Yep. always thought distance people would somehow shield South Dakota. Many low IQ. simply can't comprehend going last 2 months. know people thought 2 month lock ending meant Pandemic also ending knowing would last 2021. Can't believe still explain people push herd immunity would overwhelm hospital system. 

We would need tens thousands new hospital staff trained ready go within weeks. could beds ventilators world, one staff them, means nothing. 

By time hospitals overwhelmed would far late undo damage caused. No, understand saying disinfect things/surfaces regularly. airborne transmission main mode difficult avoid unless one wears N95 mask esp aerosols stay suspended air long period time. 

I guess people live developed/rich countries might easier time virus India, downright impossible avoid thanks airborne transmission dense population. virus studied scientists 10 months now. full genetic sequence, electronic microscope photos, understand structure virus, proteins has, mechanisms attacks body. Scientists also generally understand body‚Äôs immune response works.

This isn‚Äôt really new virus anymore, scientists understand many different types therapies vaccines basically developed, tested moment.

Plasma use important evidence, convalescent plasma therapy works taking antibodies blood someone previously virus injecting person currently virus, basically bolstering immune system. Antibodies produced first person‚Äôs body, meaning immune system developed cells could fight virus. similar treatment given Trump. Title post Misleading.

The title says ""died COVID-19 pandemic""

While article actually says:

""Researchers¬†determined nearly 75,000 additional¬†deaths **indirectly** caused pandemic."" ... ""from illnesses¬†such Alzheimer's disease, diabetes heart disease""

It's hard understand trust issues data. final straw lot honest bussinesses. restaurants running razor thin margins crisis. barely survived first lockdown government help. end. Expect hundreds thousands people flood job market.  surprised like Amy Coney Barrett nomination - hearing becomes super spreader event numerous important people infected.  MISLEADING HEADLINE:

Vaccines give herd immunity want. Well, 38,000 people per year die car accidents US, 3 million injured.

You took different direction deviated point post. Tbh, countries associated post little concern me. sure felt need redirect intended point. Exactly, high school friend says knows nurse told motorcycle deaths counted COVID /s confirmed reinfected oook.

Right dude let go test theory novel virus that's already killed 210,000+ America alone.  Nah f you, provided numerous sources bias got find one word latched onto. Next thing know, science wrong doctor Chinese. fucking knows anymore worthless idiots yourself. still exposure I'm klutz  muh lockdowns Hmmm, gave away 300k doses back May. think ""only dozen"" got them.   ***Jy-na Show data many 1 25 year olds strokes. bad faith argument, assuming anyone lockdowns wants houseparties. fucking realize people losing bussinesses livelihoods? Families getting financial ruins. sure, everyone excited prospect another lockdown anti-masker. Herd immunity. joke. started media Sweden cases rising too. MN surrounded sea COVID. Look MN % positive rates compared neighbors - pretty nuts. what? 3 weeks nothing. Hardly anyone age dying. 18 states literally even one teenager child death. Zilch. would know considering still new? 

Or would mean multiple vaccinations yeah idk shit plasma use dont see antibodies would affect usage. 

Either way idc well see happens coming pretty sus bro. Post another link states people 25 strokes. time continually respond me, time this. I‚Äôll take failure admission wrong. world losing sense smell mild symptom? Positivity rate pretty flat. likely due increased testing. Kids need physically go school.

Those old enough remote partially remote hopefully corporations need kids' parents go work.

So hospitals police departments. really enough consider kids. Whooooo ! USA! USA! USA! mother fucker.

mother fuckers kindly ask group Give links New Zealand, Taiwan, South Korea, etc life close 100% normal aggressively beat virus. old people obese people minorities they‚Äôve trying kill since day one biggie. started one politician backtracked said it. People also dumb fall it. Like govt going issues giving hospitals money lying deaths get money. truly fraud, govt would happy. correct issue, mean belittle that, context important, specifically online communication verbal cues.

The point trying make is, sad sad world comments like mine could even seen serious. non-sensical clearly mocking well known statement POTUS. think seriously over-simplified premise. aware what's going Ukraine right Russia, example? think Ukraine responsibility censor active disinformation genuinely instigated civil war based almost entirely lies? 
 
You're basically repeating old talking point days strict institutional hold information. could pretend like need censor, reality system structured formal channels (like several network news stations people got information) effectively censored system. 
It took years, eventually internet blew whole thing open. yet we're still living principle internet espouse here. Megyn Kelly years ago big interview Alex Jones Sandy Hook ""conspiracy"". big deal basically first time, major institutional legitimate media figure dug Alex Jones InfoWars mud held public see. justified saying basically said, ""sunlight best disinfectant"" - course many suspect wanted controversial story ratings.. 
 
anyhow, huge bomb. people ashamed would expose hatemonger [to even effectively empower further. recent popular documentary HBO disinformation, families Sandy Hook victims talked stuff. Basically Facebook platforms removed Alex Jones daily death-threat calls stopped. Sunlight growing Alex Jones ilk like weed, virus.

Every immune system different. two people seem reinfected doesn‚Äôt mean will. Chances are, body pretty good building immunity foreign know leave house, right?

Tomorrow bars, restaurants closed, we're literally worst corona hotspot world. headline article leaves really crucial word ""excess"" - is, number deaths would statistically predictable. written, right, makes little sense. idea trying say. I'm even sure that's sentence.

The point deaths include lockdowns policy decisions, necessarily virus itself. make assumptions I‚Äôve realized. tell you. I‚Äôve realized way many morons like there, trying best appear intelligent, falling super short attacking grammars getting upset call stupidity sentence enhancers. 

I also realized, 30 medical centers working data, opinion, basically worthless doctors claiming people dieing strokes.

Good job Ace! made 3rd grade!  should. Fellow argies reddit conviniently ignoring hard media fought quarentine. acknowledge Sweden's pandemic response resulted atrocious level preventable deaths? continual Sweden maximalism apologizing? 

I can't speak anyone else, hate Sweden, I'm saddened see unnecessary death toll. Sticking head sand caused prevent similar tragedies future. cold completely different ballgame. immune system response common cold flawed, internal immunity vaccination possible

If believe body can‚Äôt built immunity covid, would also imply developing virus impossible (studies showing vaccines work). would also imply convalescent plasma therapies wouldn‚Äôt work (they do).

No misinformation here. I‚Äôm doctor, I‚Äôve long conversations friends mine work biotech actively working covid therapeutics understand virus it‚Äôs mechanisms action quite well. Yeah, heard before. Florida, Texas... Regal cinemas closed theaters US Europe. many people still think ploy Democrats make Trump lose election. fucking insane. not, people like count ""acceptable dath toll"" go houseparties right? stir shit China Japan, S.Korea, Taiwan, India, Australia, NZ buy fighter jets bombs. Yeah really hard guys. Probably kind story Netherlands too, update due tomorrow.

Hang there!  Yeah, don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fine fine (no pun intended) someone leaving homes. correct much misinformation find direct quote discourages unnecessary arguments, that's trying accomplish. issue though, it, person reading written statement without context tends interpret sentence whatever way they're feeling. they're feeling positive, may positive connotation, on. Like, recall experiment done psychologists showed people neutral picture, asked describe it, negative affect interpreted neutral things negative things. yeah, understand point, nuts things gotten. 200 thousand plus deaths U.S. n accurate number? reporting billions dead Tom Yeah, you‚Äôve definitely realized wrong trying save face now. Like said, agree disagree particular article. Find one states outright. Shouldn‚Äôt hard. Denmark Lol not? government bought 500k doses. People covid get charged extra standard care year.

Although monthly health insurance expected rise 10 euros per month next year.

Which still 10% increase Westerners conflicted.

All saying Chinese hiding numbers.

They say China controlling epidemic power.

So eyes, China control not?

The Chinese know anyway, know guys know not. kidding? family stack cloth masks. get worn once, tossed laundry. Better nothing! study wasn‚Äôt lot proof immunity. say why: it‚Äôs Canada‚Äôs job enforce US‚Äôs border closures. 

Canada requires quarantine return, important part. It‚Äôs like don‚Äôt remember March April. might ask couple follow questions point? agree assessment science reception often viewed reddit, agree quote ""look critically"" often applied. also agree that, like not, science become heavily partisanly politicized, particularly US. However, think backlash instance might also due specific circumstances surrounding COVID particular? 

I remember lot bipartisan outrage Aylward essentially pretended Taiwan exist time anti-Chinese sentiment already high point think something like 20-30 years. Trump (and GOP generally) strong negative opinions China, well centrist Democrats. supporters touting line trust experts general sense, *specifically* WHO, ties China origin virus. about-face (although may make sense evolution statistics) hard take seriously that. 

On side aisle, lot people angry Democrat supporters resolute opinion deaths lockdown-related COVID-related causes important. Economic recession, mental health, etc. secondary concerns deaths virus, especially hard-hit blue collar industries US. people care global poverty due falling tourism travel industries come hypocritical. 

Additionally, lot third-party voters (especially anarcho-left alt-right) also expressed skepticism hardest-hit countries (by COVID deaths) seem Western, hardest-hit countries (by economic measures) seem Eastern. skepticism I've heard lot people whether they're pro-science anti-science, rather political motivations behind decision lock not. never science regard; always political motivation, see issue ""scientific examination"" ""political/Chinese corruption."" 

Furthermore, people told COVID deaths mattered most, provided ample evidence shutdowns/lockdowns *do* reduce deaths. argument official making ""lockdowns prevent COVID deaths,"" worth prevent COVID deaths anymore. However, people seen cases/hospitalizations/etc. rising reopenings, confused CDC WHO, spent lot time reiterating many countries COVID deaths important measure understand current situation, saying measuring stick longer best one use. 

Totally agree reddit science overall, guess think lot framing matters, explains resistance lot unique/unaligned political groups many subreddits response specific statement. (I endorse views, stating I've able gather). mention, gets really dry, particles small get statically attracted mask stick even smaller holes mask. believe you‚Äôre saying.

That's dumb. miss family. thanksgiving weekend canada away family prevent spread. theory death #'s closely resemble/follow new cases #'s certain time delay. case especially second big ""hump"" (that peaked mid-late july)? Wow, removed link. BIG surprise. Doctors give recommendations individual basis based lifestyle testing. people Reddit acting like personalized information doctor gave applies everyone.

The Institute Medicine recommends 600 IU people 1-70. Many people think recommendation low, widespread recommendation 6000 IU. Tons extra people dying reason need worry /s EXACTLY. Think people's lives after. it‚Äù

""Something particular might need spoon feed you? I'm willing, long that's asking.""

Bear mind, Facebook. people anonymous many dreamt, decades, putting place. Eat eggs liver needed. Smh biggest problem ""do research""-ers, usually actual research spewing rhetoric, research little basis call reality. ultimate question ""If person get COVID-19, would likely still alive today?"" Yeah edited comment thinking same. think likely secondary effect infection rate, still probably statistically significant.

My understanding current estimation average IFR closer 0.6%. Still approximately ballpark, somewhat less grim. would agree anyone says things like ""only 1%"" idiot. People either believe science medicine not. 

If I‚Äôm diabetic get mauled bear blood sugar goes crazy I‚Äôm ICU die complications attributed diabetes, bear attack still caused death. 

If I‚Äôm car accident get concussion leads death, concussion killed car accident caused it. 

If get shot, it‚Äôs technically bullet killed me. It‚Äôs (usually) combination sepsis hypovolemic shock blood loss, gunshot actually caused it. 

Perhaps would better CDC listed death certificates ‚Äúx condition secondary COVID‚Äù instead like south park pandemic special. died ""duuue covid"". 

And no, nobody reads here; click bait article definitely non-peer-reviewed study. compare number deaths year average year. link info bottom CDC page linked. see MANY deaths far year compared expectations average year, 200,000, current estimated death toll covid. People like fill sadness fate humanity. even showing world suffering pandemic well makes difference.  Hell, even Russia, tightly controlled propaganda media, unable shift narrative badly they‚Äôve hit.

It‚Äôs times like need say southern accent, ‚Äúbless heart,‚Äù walk away. much victims decades ideological subversion...they never realize happened either, it‚Äôs way late. fuck back /r/sino also understand, much like might not, catching droplets.

Fabric catch things much smaller holes it. matter smallest hole.

This layers fabric matter well, leaves chances things get trapped.

There whole science behind kind thing, I'm sick absolute idiots throwing ""microns"" magically understand filtering reading facebook. subreddit really wants Americans die COVID-19. It‚Äôs frustrating . Almost maddening family dies virus people run around saying it‚Äôs hoax. become lot violent since sisters death. can‚Äôt take lightly people shitting death like that. I'd board prison labour if:

A) got choose whatever work detail (with exceptions degree course, use imagination those).

B) paid actual wages fucking *pennies*. That's fucking slavery, matter slice it. going use labor, better fucking paying adequately it. care they're serial killer pedophile rapist-- problem set precedent okay exploit x person, setting broaden later line, regardless: universal.

C) work actually helped get jobs when/if they're released. example, prisoners CA working stop fires able get jobs realm. End fucking story. going people fight fires prison, release say ""lol no"", effectively saying never welcome society-- society criminals cannot attain employment barbaric: ways think cruel simply prescribing capital punishment crimes. What's fucking point reforming no-one even gives chance? can't tell people joking. 2 seconds discomfort. Look way. swear GNC behind stories. like 10th supplement need start taking now. /S Yup I‚Äôm Florida covid testing early March idea fuck even go get tested. called local hospital said aren‚Äôt taking covid patients. Florida fucked it‚Äôs even funny People believe anything absolves personal responsibility Can‚Äôt silent 5g activated mind control nanobots inside vaccine! nurses already unionized 
. could trust everyone use common sense. Sometimes known using good sense lord give ya. regardless, make less distressing people read. someone arriving sub first time duped. Oh wow reckon wont start go away till January 21st 2021 Hmm good point. Even government showed unified response made masks mandatory, would partially nullified anti-mask Karens. exist. see, COVID kill people, therefore extra corpses fake numbers, except ones Cuomo murdered. It‚Äôs funny mention that. work long stretch major interstate medic. height lockdown, would surprised carnage seen. people lucky, others, don‚Äôt understand ended carnage. It‚Äôs insane going even 80 mph could modern vehicle let alone 145 (that bad one) health questionnaire one question asks alive human says, warning covid ahh classic, wait 2 weeks.  another infected Coronavirus develops Pneumonia dies, died Pneumonia caused Covid-19

How know?

WHO estimates 80% people Covid asymptomatic.

So old unhealthy get pneumonia test positive Covid death exactly determine emphatically asymptomatic?

What got Covid 2 days ago exhibited symptoms?

Do write ""Died Covid?""

This completely illogical. guess.

Unless prove death happened DIRECT result Covid means blind guess scientific falsely inflates death counts. watch streams course topic comes randomly.

Without fail plenty people chat spamming fake death told thousands, tens hundreds, literally flu, etc etc.

It actually blows fucking mind get far in, still people mentally challenged subject. minds fully warped.

They're voting you. Good luck ""vote"" ""say"" lol. really dumb thing is, taking action hurt economy much federal government took strong action controlled lockdowns, enforced mask wearing, extensive testing, contact tracing. Yeah, they're infected, droplets tit's chance nipple-clamp factory getting mask they're wearing anyone else's mask well. sure would find hard believe. people remember draconian style lockdowns containment measures imposed started spread? People allowed leave house groceries. gatherings, parties, anti-mask Karens deal either.

Are numbers 100% accurate? Probably not. hear people say grossly underestimated even level US ridiculous. whatever currently solution either Ok phew makes sense. wasn‚Äôt 100% certain worded first time. Stay safe. let‚Äôs give science, capable dramatically improving medical outcomes 40% americans willing listen it! Yup, I've really nervous auto-immune diseases run family (my dad MS aunt died Crohn's). friends assume I'm low-risk since I'm young relatively healthy. dad bad bout mono college, turns specifically linked highly MS.

I really want roll dice getting thing; terrifies even mild case time might end it. Plot twist: company owned anti-maskers /s So... US government lying numbers? So-called ""essential workers"" get first. course starts anyone medical field/working hospital, Fire/EMS, grocery stores, etc. etc. rich people want get back partying. Nope x60-x84. 2/3rd excess deaths attributed COVID. Yes, Seattle, Washington 3 weeks. Could drive over, fly in. Flew back went Vancouver, British Columbia. Border guards asked quarantine plan, signed paperwork. Took next flight Edmonton. Phone call came day 5 quarantine. Nothing wrong law enforcement properly. Nothing ever change one wants go change better.  NYC average pop. density 27,000 people per square mile (manhattan alone 67K), opposed 11 people per square mile.

I'm sure amount hospitals (per person?) relation NY SD, I'm sure fair compare 2 areas. you‚Äôre saying there‚Äôs middle ground...you‚Äôre either responsible adult raving grandma killer. 

Typical r/coronavirus perspective. Antibody testing everywhere shown actual number infections perhaps 5 10 times number confirmed infections.

Here's CDC study showing way back April, number confirmed infections U.S. 751,245, estimated number actual infections 6,454,951. article Reason take CDC's estimated infection fatality rate multiply number deaths estimate 32 million actual infections U.S. problem using numbers everyone knows real number infections much higher number confirmed infections. Publishing 8 million figure know real number 30 40 million misleading. using deceptive dishonest argumentative technique. this:

Saying something like ""some people say"", followed something false, insinuate truthfulness still give called it. 

That way, try deceive people still say ""I never actually said so, people saying so!

That here. dishonest argumentative technique cut out. check go back home kids homes then. frequent traveler/flyer need make sure pick N95's equivalent (KF94's, KN95's). Korean Starbucks case study demonstrated high filtration masks stave respiratory infection enclosed spaces. Probably boat now. Woke yesterday unable smell feeling slight cold. busy life get tested mild symptoms, see need. self-quarantining go outside 2 weeks. sure selfish? closest testing center like 40 mins away since live middle nowhere quite hassle add data. makes dollars makes sense. Dutch authorities

Danish authorities 40 million lowest number people believe. consensus seems true infections somewhere around 5-8x official number (which would 40m - 64m). 

That said, nobody knows sure can't really make decisions data actually have, says 8m. gymnastics headline fascinating study.  looked it. x84 unspecified self harm. Sauce significant surface spread?? Trump world leaders literally said want test less believe numbers scientists presenting. I'm sure AZN majority americam owned

It's British. offer years ago buy huge uproar UK it. think got denied government even.

So, take real virus field, isolate it, grow appropriate growth medium, harvest stabilize carrier fluid. Crazy New York City nearly ten times population entire state? crazy all. r/confidentlyincorrect Exactly, NYC probably 8 million infections alone April. bleach idea misinformation, point strawman. Don‚Äôt ask guys numbers, it‚Äôs always ‚ÄúI saw Karen Walmart clearly 50% US breaking rules‚Äù Norway **is** chart posted. Jesus christ can‚Äôt understand paragraph text you? None even points, hypotheticals irrelevant main argument. Also, daily protests growing globe coronavirus restrictions. genuinely see that?

And yes, playing game involves massive economic sacrifice making life miserable, realistic chance success, absolutely stop playing it. Otherwise you‚Äôre stuck ‚Äúsomething must/can done‚Äù phase mixed sunk costs fallacy keep going one day pay off, far damage good world right now

Seeing tiptoe around argument I‚Äôll copy comment wrote elsewhere thrust it, including it‚Äôs feasible (there many cases, people ignore self isolation orders, doesn‚Äôt stop infections spreading faster traced). Try engaging time please don‚Äôt comment again. 

There three parts statement: ‚Äúcontain‚Äù, ‚Äúan endemic virus‚Äù ‚Äúwith basic measures‚Äù. OP suggesting backed science. flat wrong, science could certainly tell us whether would worth cost case.

Containing means something significant sustained 12-18 month pandemic. Globally clearly failed, countries succeeded come enormous cost still far soon say whether maintained, whether cost maintaining worth it. It‚Äôs also enormous risk, reason vaccine ineffective (fortunately seems unlikely).

Secondly, examples I‚Äôm given places like South Korea, New Zealand, Vietnam, closed borders almost immediately never allowed virus become widespread population. Congratulations them, clearly applicable 95% countries failed beginning faced sustained dispersed transmission many months. Suggesting could turn back clock try harder absurd. explained comment example China isn‚Äôt applicable non-authoritarian state, I‚Äôd gladly take many pandemics exchange freedom enjoy democracy.

And finally, idea need ‚Äúbasic measures‚Äù political/public solve it. People hate restrictions daily life, every passing day economic pain restrictions becomes real, especially developing world. That‚Äôs say nothing spiritual social loss suspension nearly cultural activities social rituals. It‚Äôs delusional think people won‚Äôt push back that, every right to. massive sacrifices.

The reason I‚Äôm passionate people genuinely believing anywhere could stop tried hard enough creates idea so, complicit responsible deaths. ignorant sentiment creates toxic atmosphere times already hard people suffering. don‚Äôt think adds anything discussion. That's fans want..


It's like understand 1% 100 million 300 million Americans is.


Or know care. loved article. I‚Äôm glad journalists willing discuss positive developments throughout pandemic able assure people won‚Äôt last forever. That's know they're training next generation Paris 2024 games. 

/s forgot 'Hillary Clinton, Obama democrats soon arrested crimes revealed world' want wild ride Laboratories already standardized intentional infection vectors COVID-19. even mentioned NIH run clinical trial early Remdesivir therapy primates.

They needed standardized nose-squirt formula SARS-CoV-2. statewide policy insure mitigation efforts Sorry mate, you‚Äôve got knowledge obviously. knew something wrong Ischgl kept bars open made really sick employees go work. knew big spread Italy acted like nothing happened. guess septuagenarians stay home social occasions, bars, etc. try explain someone believe covid19 cant understand trying say matter try explain it. That's dubious conclusion poll actually directly compare two. So, let's 35 percent voters saying concerned economy 57 percent saying concerned public health ‚Äî roughly even last week. results similar among political fact compare two, result opposite. result mistakenly assumed aggregate preferences proportionally reflect sensitivity. actually standard part basic marketing courses somewhat unintuitive. But, know taken one. am. bike. What‚Äôs actual deal removal comments here? feel like it‚Äôs way control honest I'm nurse. explain it. LOVE explaining it. Please read go embarrass dumb fucks.

It started Centers Medicare Medicaid Services (CMS) increased reimbursement rates Covid patients - duh - they're super labor intensive require shit ton PPE usually using hospitals can't charge insurance for.

So fuckers FoxNews heard decided meant hospitals incentive claim patient Covid whether not. dumb fucks listen FoxNews heard decided 100% happening.

Here's 100% happening:

1) CMS fucking stupid. someone comes car crash dies hospital changes billing records say, ""Lol jk CMS, totes Covid pt. pony sweet Covid $$$,"" CMS gonna look records like, ""Um...why ordering multiple blood transfusions surgeries respiratory treatments lol we're paying Covid rates patient.""

2) 1 MILLION physicians United States. Good luck getting agree *anything*, let alone massive conspiracy commit fraud. Doctors could lose licenses something like this, leaving literally hundreds thousands dollars student loan debt without job ability get job future.

3) Nurses stand around bat eyelashes say, ""Tee hee, sure whatever say, doc!"" *independent* legal, moral, ethical obligation protect patients harm. Harm would include unnecessary medical treatments, open shut case medical battery could prosecuted lose licenses livelihoods. 3 MILLION nurses US. outnumber physicians 3:1.

That shit absolutely happening. Go make sure dumb fucks know it. Either understand reading intentionally misrepresenting data. saying people killing counted ""covid deaths"" stating known conditions patient associated covid death. What? CDC nothing ICD codes. selfish whatsoever wanting live life ""normally."" let self-righteous self-proclaimed pandemic warriors try tell otherwise. blogspot.com may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

And every reasonable person understand lockdowns come quote dosent mention lockdowns problem

The piece concluded course analyzing 150,000 COVID deaths, 75,000 additional deaths may resulted response pandemic. draw conclusion whether that's bad not. think is. may feel way. mean, realesed phase 3 trial results yet, point probably much different Russia's ""Sputnik"" strategy.

Yes. wear face shield keep gross liquids types touching face getting mask wet. said, shields alone useless, meant worn face mask/respirator eye covering well. change policy testing symptomatic recently? not, policy remained relatively same, trend still shows alarming increase infection regardless actual infection rate general population is. receive Regeneron? like dozen patients nation (including Donald) access experimental antibody therapeutic? luckily, caught early symptomatic, given preferential treatment admitted hospital fell ill. normal working-class Americans get treatment. expected say Ireland one single country, separate part north.

They hopefully understand. bought much stock early months pandemic. know. Screw bastards.

But 8+ months ago. Surely could replenished stocks now. Sort of, face, specifically things like membrane surface inside nose, eyes, mouth.

Like scratch cheek whatever. China: aww shit go care America. China's policy. said eliminated China, suggests otherwise. Hence commented... Remember South Korea, back Feb/March bit mess (not scale current US/Europe though), bad, shooting article, study Indirect consequences could include people afraid go hospital another condition fear catching coronavirus number issues caused exacerbated COVID-19‚Äôs economic mental health impacts, loss health insurance layoffs, inability afford medications pay cuts, skyrocketing rates depression America‚Äôs adults, condition negatively impacts many aspects America tested everyone positive rate would much lower 10% though. Democracy spoken  Freedom = competence? Lol. reality... sure, folks counted COVID deaths.. not.

Redditors cannot handle truth. thread alone dense people lying claiming happen even one time, proof happened quite lot. We've even given reason - hospitals got kickbacks death reported due Covid. Yet Redditors lie claim that's true.  many people getting tested coronavirus? high positive rate makes think testing people going hospitals doctors office oversimplified. realize everyone would get infected? would reach herd immunity anywhere 20 70 percent. Would death toll higher obesity smoking? Perhaps. Would 40 million like suggest? even close. from? Vinegar shit, know. even killing bacteria, any. guess dont see those. mostly read articles. Thanks. imagine idiots made sandy hook parents feel someone Covid dies something completed unrelated, death isn‚Äôt taken death tally death certificate verifies unrelated cause death. rare begin with. state, one papers published article state issued correction man Covid died car accident. extremely rare doesn‚Äôt come close amount deaths missed. worry, government let know. Yes, style familiar. let's clear: genuinely imagine information withheld HIPAA statute/regs?

because that's pathetically naive -- best  uk children forced attend school known positive cases. get tested meet one 3 symptom criteria, mess country in! understand meaning comorbidity. COVID CAUSE COMORBIDITY. pre-existing condition. SMH. mutated several times according reports. mutations made better, worse us deal with. logic make sense. Contact tracing never 100% accurate people usually aware got infected. tell people meet, impossible public places. know what's accurate way know infected number? Fucking test everyone. actually guaranteed kill bacteria. Hell, bacteria EAT vinegar. Others produce it.

DO USE VINEGAR EXPECT STERILITY. EVER. Ask, yes. Freedom die streets without healthcare get evicted middle pandemic. Freedom sounds awesome. virus cell, it‚Äôs alive. ia CHINESE BOT page. comment leadership dictatorship people choice. agree right way stop something like pandemic unified strategy. simply disagree leadership portion comment leadership implies people follow someone. one takes Free choice leadership dictatorship.

The lack intelligent argument either side comment shows nothing propaganda piece. Fu79 CCP! want see America suffer, blame Trump. That's guys celebrating high body count. NYC got nuked today North Korea, guys would celebrate blame Trump. guys definitely hate America. guys think worse Nazi Germany. AMERICANS RACIST!!! REPUBLICANS RACIST!!!! Even though UK invented Slave Trade, Canada killed Native Americans, Germans killed Jews, Blacks, every country racist past. Apparently America invented racism exists there. guess BLM protests happened EU right? way, Europeans PERFECT, INTELIGENT SMART. Americans dumb racist hilbillie red necks kill 5000 black people day right? guess EU DIVERSE population. mostly rich white people right? (Europe Black Population: 12.2 million) (USA Black Population: 44.1 million ) America white people right? black people dead America right? Killed darn rednecks?

Typical Reddit Moment. I've noticed least one mods similar attitude well. know can, countries treating way FAR better aren't, means healthier economies them. self respecting biologist tell virus doesn‚Äôt meet criteria life. entire article keeps dancing around this, it‚Äôs clearly written someone much science background. use ‚Äúliving, live, alive‚Äù.....over over. lost people year year.

Not one Covid, everyone wrong end shutdowns measures.

While true underlying substance abuse mental health conditions respond well isolation, fear, unemployment, etc... 

I cannot help think individuals whose deaths caused expedited covid response cruelly counted covid.

Isolation, fear, inability support one's family, loss career, loss one's family business... things also killers. Agreed. Texas live, it‚Äôs Inception level cults. level Q. masks bad, Trump savior, Pence pedo raped ate 700 kids, worries JFK Jr alive Trumps side VP soon enough roll tide us Great Awakening times debt forgiveness good life. crazy anti-mask culting better others.

Deleting cookies exit handful sites seems safer running extension. least available official location.  Lol, Swedish article came swede living Norway feeling sad ""feels like plauge bearer"" ""people accuse spreading disease"".

Yeah cause Norway attatched country acted absolutley braindead. cause good bit fustration. Dont blame Norway it, blame Sweden letting disease spread.  would journalists that? journalists reported treatment old people nursing homes spring suddenly become nationalists comes statistics? need come new conspiracies. old ones wearing thin.  context, written gates ""Work set free"", German though course. parts comment refer shutdown? intended didn‚Äôt shutdown Laissez faire attitude encouraged. mean economic damage maybe might slightly better without one, economists saying along government closures aren‚Äôt cause it. see many businesses open, struggling get customers. survey macroeconomic economists 74% said US would better economically shutdown goes social isolation fear prevents people interacting person too, especially since digital alternatives available nowadays.

Those flu pandemics mentioned took place different era vaccinations beginning people sadly much used infectious disease outbreaks. case 1918 flu information outbreak intentionally suppressed people idea bad was.

I‚Äôm saying couldn‚Äôt done fight indirect deaths increased poverty unfortunate effects pandemic, it‚Äôs I‚Äôm tired people acting like shutdowns cause they‚Äôre not. Nope, data analysis facts. like the, ""If take caution care others, must mental illness"" brigade. sociopath circlejerk. Damn... Hahahaha fucking moron. good news nobody died causes since pandemic started. know yet, comment pretty foolish. 

We might learn 10 years later there's 80% shingles-like side effect worse.

Not knowing means get arrogant right now. one ever literally everyone stay home lockdown. You‚Äôve heard essential workers? good number place. Even China essential personnel working keep society functioning.

You‚Äôre understanding lockdowns mean. F [it actually survives 28 days I'm sure fear could tell ""just look way"" help. I'm joking, one here. One primary cooperative bodies industry viability studies like - pretty much useless real world application address anything regards necessary viral load infection addition perfect, lab conditions items inoculated virus.

Of course stopped industry panicking surface transmission instead much clearer issue aerosol transmission. enlightened. Isnt kn95 Chinese standard? thought produced China. Chinese harvest dna health covid Yup, US. confirm healthcare disaster.  Thank posting this! never saw July article. He's probably American citizen, stamped Canadian passport visited USA exactly one year ago last February. arrival air though, previous three visits made going across border car. America take bit seriously. Instead thinking everything conspiracy them, would nice. I've waiting years eyesight stabilized yet 28. Mom 61 said never did... Same, fact political parties actively trying take away insurance coverage Americans absolutely disgusting, quite frankly repulsive.

Love see Trump touting world-class care slowly attempts take away surance millions

Its think Trump total scumbag... know  good they're taking seriously now. would nice done start. 

No hate, bit critical could taken care earlier. [archive link anyone trouble accessing article mean look long taking Australia. They‚Äôve months second full hard lockdown virus shows signs eradication. Thanks info, never know believe anymore age disinformation. they‚Äôre going normal trials.

Completely inaccurate.

The normal trials would years happening it. frequently mentioned media New Caledonia also great. Sounds like obesity real epidemic USA. except ADMITTED know lied conserve PPE experience find people think hoax, compared amount people sick longer care.

I horribly embarrassed American point. Everything since March royally fucked up. point would renounce citizenship fucking heartbeat meant could Canadian English something. Excess deaths right metric counting number people killed whole event, misinterpretation means. response virus entailed, say, mass job loss hunger (especially lower-income families communities color), disingenuous say deaths resulting factors caused virus. caused response. 

There's obviously real trade-off balance factors virus damage, know right answer is, can't pretend trade-off exist.   

I think do, like understand geopolitics add onto - using ethanol rubbing alcohol, shoot 70% concentration. that, evaporates fast useful (so concentration better).

Source: microbiologist use disinfect surfaces lab. Lasik used spam reddit hell ads pretending genuine posts comments filled shills. Made wary whole method. CDC lumps flu pneumonia pneumonia: 55,672

When everyone quotes numbers, *always* say ""flu deaths"". Baffling misunderstood (and actually replacing similar unsourced comment mods deleted ""misinformation"", apparently pretty widespread ignorance even here).

Sources showing Yeah I‚Äôm isolating indefinitely virus 99.99% survival rate age group

Sorry sure dishonestly part, certainly possible started. live China city 8 million even know COVID happened. cases quite time, everything completely normal. Another city lived previously outbreak couple months ago, confirm tested absolutely everyone. 

The things they've done possible pretty much anywhere else. plus side 'communism' guess.  Depression caused lockdown even appear really factor calculations. 

As noted earlier, excess deaths assigned Covid-19 could include deaths involving Covid19 misclassified causes death deaths indirectly related Covid-19
pandemic. NCHS made effort examine excess deaths assigned Covid-19 by
cause death. September 24, 2020, NCHS attributed 28,797 excess deaths Alzheimer‚Äôs disease related dementias, 16,040 excess deaths hypertensive diseases,
11,222 excess deaths ischemic heart disease, 10,285 excess deaths diabetes, 3,056
excess deaths influenza pneumonia.29 estimates suggest majority excess
deaths identified study likely assigned Alzheimer‚Äôs disease related dementias
or various circulatory diseases diabetes. possible substantial fraction deaths
of individuals pre-existing chronic conditions acquire Covid-19 die result are
ascribed pre-existing condition. may constitute many excess deaths not
attributed Covid-19. Great. much immunity time toilet bowl puck use. good news keeps rolling in. already read talking points. Yes. Dad's side family believe real (or real overblown liberal media), seen almost year. 

They HUGE family gatherings, wedding 300+ people, sorts nonsense. Now, uncle it. hemochromatosis attacked heart, kidneys, (in round way) nervous system. fighting going hospital, basically said die home. wife, mother (who lives them), baby custody it. little cousins spent night weekend prior testing positive, it. mother sent school ""she's busy"" can't keep home... ""just cough"". 

This turning shit show. even know yet since found last week. What's really crazy family still blowing ""just cough"" uncle likely die. whole thing highlighted feeling towards sick. think sickness weakness, moral failure enjoy good health inherit goodness. empathy owners people need exercise. gyms spread, indoor dinning. people managing poorly, and/or planning poorly. bought one cloth mask cheaper bunch disposable ones. plan needing 6 months, either misinformed needed reality check.

I know probably going laundry everyday, buy 2-3 masks least rotate them. months this, even DT miracle cure real, everyone going vaccinated day one, still going need wear masks inside buildings can't prove vaccinated.

You're going seeing masks really long time, get fashionable ones wash least often wash underwear. I‚Äôm pretending I‚Äôm CNN. facts matter? voting brigade began yesterday reason. obvious seems organized. let bother you. like Drew Carey show points matter. keep telling truth, let ignorance win. Please don‚Äôt lump Americans together, majority us actually prevent getting spreading disease. Yeah, people like never happy matter done combat virus. China done severe lockdown start contained virus, bellyaching horrible infringement human rights authoritarianism shitshow US compare now. Ok, give seniors want one N95. reopen? Wow. Just...if place, wouldn‚Äôt even know say them. mean, anyone even cosmically unfair bullshit, especially know relatives won‚Äôt even stay reality rest us? just...don‚Äôt know  CDC confirmed 6% people died without pre-existing conditions. 200k+ dying Covid due pre-existing conditions would still alive Covid. takes serious leaps logic see say ""Ah yes, Covid killing people""  reckoning coming, organize around it. Mainland China shithole compared HK, sorry one sane enough support country steals organs political opponents still concentration camps. deaths concentrated....in one offs young people conditions? *overwhelmingly* skewed towards 70+? China please come save us USA. killed neglect billionaire rulers. British always pussies. queue better most, follow direction better most, well behaved little peasants.

you seem like would fit right months? told 31 dec found 25 dec. Yeah know truth hurts truth. test 9 million fight one test wait days results?  Exactly. Logical consistency exactly strong suit downplayers. dad (who live with) woke Covid symptoms getting tested. tests positive, would stupid really try avoid getting him? mean, I‚Äôd quarantine either way worry much due immunity sounds nice.

Here‚Äôs wild thing, pandemic didn‚Äôt stop 3 months ago, 4 months ago. means get new, updated data play with. week Notice protests started 0 uptick daily new covid cases. 

Almost like protesters wearing masks arent issue.

In fact, even MASSIVE PROTESTS MONTHS, daily covid case number went every day since ~April 20th, middle September.

Awkward. Republicans could wear mask 4 weeks would COVID. theyre fucking inbred dumb. agree masks distancing great tools, part problem many people live areas masks required, unless you‚Äôre fortunate enough N95 you‚Äôre exposed go out. sample HK staying HK.

after sample collection, name id processed become number lab sample number.

Stop spreading misinformation. risk population much Hessevik Paulsen Norwegian Institute Public Health also says countries count deaths differently Norwegian deaths probably significantly Norway counted Sweden

it literally says right bottom, even read article? It‚Äôs Republicans encouraging protesting streets social distancing past 4 months straight? Huh, coulda fooled me. think 5-10%. 5000 tests day (though like quite private clinics citizens paid tests afaik). time riot. nobody wants live downtown staples center. Japan one countries know situation is. densely populated country, average age high, people mobile travel work crowded settings. live small houses huge buildings. Testing low, 5-8% positivity rate. circumstances, expect disease spread like wildfire.

What going on? say people get tested hide it, see high number hospitalizations. people even go hospitals, see excess death rate. honest idea happening there. I'm genuinely curious. Agreed. super excited nasal flu vaccination came hate needles, researching bit decided stick shot. *""After 9 million successful tests report additional positive tests 8 million people. 7 million residents free go back normal lives.""* - CCP Representative point, experts agree lockdowns good solution.

This blatantly false. Trump expert. Yes, thank you. :) PM get email. ‚ÄúCOVID long lasting affects impact quality life.‚Äù can, yes. That‚Äôs pretty well known fact. wasn‚Äôt claim made, though. claim COVID causing strokes young people.

There obviously cases one die seemingly healthy result strong immune system reaction response Covid let‚Äôs focus treat legal excuse care bodies. 

I generally healthy, fit young adult systemic diseases last months things changed lifestyle: increased amount sleep, cut half alcohol consumption, improved coping strategies day day stress, increased day day vegetables intake. result feel better months ago it‚Äôs 12 months counting since signs flu.

It may seem obvious well known fact people seem ignore it.

Trust healthy body best bet hard times like world pandemic world war. Even peace future self Thank also tax payers. article say claimed said.

You misinterpreted previous comment. Boldly. IFR 0.3%.

Its sitting right 1% actually. Damn, prove boy wrong, got delete comments?

Was interviewing DERM ad common skin condition prevalent people overweight. gotten feedback patients previous ads ""unrealistically trim"" developed ads featuring slightly overweight/more-normal looking people.

Fuck. empty words. comment time never proposed endorsed strategy leads level herd immunity prevents death Neither light joke. take long time understand statistical relationships. many variables definitive total morbidity disparity right now. Economic changes, social even political events change death rates meaningfully. would tens thousands deaths higher unemployment.

BMI 43 March 36 now. Still obese, lot less now. Unfortunately I‚Äôm still higher risk coronavirus BMI. Initially able shed pounds fast longer eating out. I‚Äôve leveled off. one thing worries me, read article said go start new diet coronavirus. article stated periods rapid weight loss generally go hand hand weakened immune system. author recommended hunkering maintaining current weight pandemic over. reason big diet catch virus immune system may weak able fight infection off.

So I‚Äôve living state anxiety knowing need lose lot weight I‚Äôm afraid coronavirus, afraid lose much weight, coronavirus. Well one never come close contact at-risk. Even go producers studio record come mask socially distance grandma. got Covid, would likely spread symptoms spread like sneezing coughing. case, I‚Äôd obviously quarantine everything end line transmission. again, I‚Äôm worried getting myself. Oh wow! could walk street get test without even reason. ""the country"" broad term considering 50 states handled differently. live South Florida. closed everything except Home Depot, Publix, CVS liquor stores March June. Parks closed, Boat ramps, beaches closed everyone, including walkers, surfers people could socially distance. open recreation fitness July 4th weekend. People causing trouble masks businesses June.

Isolated cases made news. Mask compliance pretty damned good live. 
 unreasonable think 200,000 -250,000 excess deaths 5 months weeks partial lockdowns.

It weeks. people 4 months way know time going end. Yes spread test positive. Lots people wait symptoms test. also spread symptoms appear, people don‚Äôt get symptoms. suppose so, make right new set riots begin again, point treating symptoms Although fines generate much needed revenue short term, heavy-handed enforcement eventually lead people leaving city. 

There‚Äôs absolutely incentive go NYC right means tourist destination result long term economic ramifications. doesn‚Äôt sound like good news thankfully don‚Äôt live there.  gonna it? literally says right ‚Äúintending publish data regarding COVID-19 patients 30s 40s suffering strokes‚Äù.

Largely that's way wealth flows anyway fundamentally flawed way economy structured. pandemic cause that... made plainly visible.  drunk drivers.

At beginning pandemic people were/still afraid use Uber Taxi. keep talking countries successful. course, everyone would love that.

You focus want lottery winners, playing lottery still dumb proposition. majority world forced playing lottery, lost, you‚Äôre embarrassed admit it.

Still many words read? beat head peer-reviewed research? ain‚Äôt substitute real thing, can‚Äôt help there, parents let down. Wow, like America, opposite. masks turned touchy issue adults. say adults observed children trouble understanding mask etiquette. parents often seem care whether mask not, I've seen children stop entering public building put mask (while parent kinda plows without thinking mask situation). I've even seen kids stop parents entering building without mask, applying own. universally understood children, many adults act like children asked put mask? setting good examples children, rely children setting good examples us. child figure out, you! Yeah, sure need ‚Äúexpert‚Äù make call. But, hey, thanks letting us know. someone lives Mexico, idea. Last month Mexican government says think extra 122,765 people died Covid, lack testing (cost 200 usd here), probably never know. Raul Rojas Mexican professor here, estimated 6 million cases, 300k deaths. Arizona manipulating numbers throughout. data scientists donate time effort publishing ""what time"" hides truth.  That's 38% tests they've taken ONE DAY positive 38% population positive.

It seems like b******* way report statistic. Judging comments here, sub can‚Äôt make mind whether schools opened closed pertains Europe

But assure headline ‚Äúcases school USA‚Äù sure shit gets going sizeable fringe, career government professionals equal ""deep state"". (The term came Turkish security professionals would defend Turkish secular state Islamist Theocrats. go well challenged Erdoƒüan.)

(not trying start debate abortion, saying think people see hypocrisy stances) Finally estimated death rate virus : 0.5 - 1 %, already takes account asymptomatic people.  surfaces matter since aerosols travel 30-40 feet 

So... aerosols travel 40 feet land surfaces?

I'm pointing seem hung aerosols realizing position virus spread way ALSO means end surfaces way.

Obsessive cleaning? implies cleaning things again, no. me, matter control. item enters ""bubble"" outside, gets ""managed"" once. Whether that's rinse sink produce, wiped reusable wipe, isolated reasonable period time depends item need. fresh produce fridge bought yesterday washed yesterday. paper towels basement Costco package wiped knew would month touched again.

With studies like showing outside range survivability ideal conditions 28 days, means ignore things sit while. Christmas present mom bought yesterday (newly released book) - sit wherever give her. new decorations may buy Christmas Thanksgiving.

To clarify, got reports happening Wuhan. fact China able contain rest cities still impressive, especially compared failure long list countries tried extremely hard, sacrificed economies freedom months: Spain, Italy come mind.

Lockdowns worked countries. People following mask mandates social distancing guidelines know whole lot now, makes virus lot less scary.

WHO projects 0.6% mortality rate. makes least 6 times deadly flu. that's measures we've taken unlike flu. Also, when's last time experimental treatment extreme measures taken president flu?

People need stop downplaying disease. going kill everyone, definitely deadly flu (and certainly whole host serious side effects) warrant mild measures like wearing mask following social country like France, locked 1000 cases per day, still widely open 26,000/day.

Do think sustainable France given healthcare systems starting get overwhelmed? consult opinion those, especially frontline healthcare staff, actually bear burden disease?

France right trying curb initial surge. People selfish idiots breaching rules wearing masks following social distancing. That's end damage economy **and** failure contain virus. Lose-lose people can't mildly inconvenienced. Yes, forecasts hard enough without ongoing pandemic ripple effects. July even point uncertainty forecast account significant second waves.

I wanted point easy say ""Look GDP shrank x last quarter, country x therefor much better country y"", usual factors see whole picture. Spanish flu pandemic, COVID old people flu.

I mean get wrong, I'm aware lockdown caused issues regarding mental health, domestic abuse decline early intervention treatments sheer numbers speak themselves. think relates cultural stuff. Still 1/3rd country running around spreading pseudoscience, Flu BS. live US large city, work music venue, pre-COVID would take public transit 50% time. don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm sickly person per se I‚Äôm stranger common cold used constantly around general public.

Even underlying condition, managing didnt kill also got covid likely would still alive never got covid. Therefore, even underlying condition like heart problems diabetes technically killed them, getting covid lead death. General hospitalizations too! believe elderly patients rarely admitted ICU, multiple geriatric departments around country actually admitted patients (when refered hospital) quite good success threating less invasive methods. numbers really difficult find national scale; report sometimes briefings Socialstyrelsen statistics them, difficult get clear idea many patients CURRENTLY hospitals (or maybe swedish still good enough understand read them) That's pathetic, it?

There amazing people site. 

I'll updating every 15th/30th month. see issues let know. suck programming. agree. people also look data available. statistics say very, people get infected church services.

There statistics people probably got infected virus. Religious gathering one statistics. accounts 0.1% infected people (I believe rounded up, less 0.1%).

Soooo.... lot things wayyyyy important look church services. People get way often infected home, work school. 0.1%? Well, people also go church stay bit sane times.

Choosing Christianity example, let's list things Bible says allow: slavery, selling children, death penalty disobedient children, genocide, rape, death penalty wearing mixed fabric.

Reason limit, whatever imaginary fairies anyone else chooses believe in. Two reasonable posts row.

My main questions are:

- stats mid-term health effects, severity, age, sex, symptoms?

- monthly antibody survey representative sample population, tests cheap?
- cheap LFA antigen tests available, groups?

- stats infection environments social groups TTI? South Korea this, low numbers.
- continual improvement open data TTI?
- selfish 20% motivated sabotage containment efforts?

- long virus survive real-world surfaces, especially food? 
- longer hours, mask mandates hand hygiene enforced food workers?
- food - potential high virus doses - major source severe disease?

- systematic effort test people visited place infectious person, chances infection, depending environment (e.g. lifts, restaurants, trains)? deaths probably COVID never confirmed. lost great aunt, matriarch family, April. long term rehab facility surgery February recovering well. suddenly came respiratory issues passed quickly. residents floor COVID. wasn‚Äôt tested after, even though medical staff hinted likely was. 

I‚Äôm thankful got visit hospital surgery locked fully down. died alone struggling breathe long life helping people really fucks think about. covid still enough So? disgusted, even offended name others, especially doctors nurses help treating this. can't go around telling people offended, asshole. protect yourself, can, educate others coherent rational way, can't change night. Educating other, means better protection brother well. \*severely\* overestimated population. get tested, usually good reason like symptoms known exposure. factors make likely actually infected.

Those get tested (which huge part population) much less likely infected, positivity rate population far positivity rate actually get tested.

See Argentina example, 70% positivity rate. much less 70% population infected right now. true countries world. idiot Cheezel Command strutting around telling everyone he's immune knows everything it.

So, feel like whole world stupid wasting time, right.

As dealing virus, yeah, could short-lived lockdowns serious testing containment system. could near zero COVID get back lives. could now. one wants effort think people institutions - like everything life - sort hoping problem go away near future own. wait wait.

I kind speculate whether doctors know bad virus speaking want avoid panic banking vaccine results spill bad news proceed next phase.

There's chance could learn something bad. Like, mild infection means statistically significant years lives. Maybe even something like 10 years dying earlier average.

Or, could learn there's long term immune problem exactly AIDS, kind like lupus manifests flares time, getting worse years go on.

This might sound alarmist, SARS-2 - given know - certainly potential produce kinds effects. they're science verify it. informative picture. 37.5% higher official COVID-19 stats: (275/200)-1=37.5 maybe obesity (40% US) determining factor?  going say, 'because fucking orange moron', fucking stupid works too.

After falling summer, coronavirus cases rise U.K. winter approaches. Liverpool one country‚Äôs highest levels infection, 600 cases per 100,000 people. Also: Italy took longer rest Europe see increase case numbers. R number, clearly 1, lagged behind countries, whether due voluntary changes behaviour resistance population. 

Evidently outright herd immunity virus cannot re-establish itself, mean easy virus spread substantial minority population infected. Knowing close makes waiting painful transmitted virus according you.  would blame conservatives people hostile lockdowns? contribute sisters death May. 

Everyone complied orders May, honestly everyone still does, I've seen almost violations outings pandemic. 

I wear mask. I'm anti-mask. anti-lying shills. type person discussing thread.

Right, ones irrationally angry even though people exist May nothing sister's death. 

So know infected blew call? knew someone infected back may, thought super lethal, would really worried want talk them. 

So happened foster kids? 

What county in? article talks secondary deaths reaction Covid, virus specifically. Oh, great, anecdote. month ago take 2 different flights, one packed people one respecting social distsncing measures. travelled 18 people none us got sick, even though half us wore cloth masks. n95, surgical mask, pair goggles face shield would say precautions, travelling pretty safe. Ahh, covering vaccines insured...it's costs risks. pretty much. least live, every place near someone, everyone wearing masks. They're saying 1.2 billion passengers travelled air period - can't empty planes passengers spread out? also believe wearing masks required onboard everywhere July.

I agree adequately answer risk flying packed flight masks, gives reassurance risks astronomical, probably similar daily tasks, like standing line cashier.

They mention two long distance flights 15 11 people probably infected, certainly risk-free. It‚Äôs gym owners conducting study ever caught Covid working out. Worthless! There's also pretty comprehensive study that's released saying average sized cock I'm masterful love maker.

The study commissioned published me. People say trump sucks want good America, it‚Äôs fault, Biden angel either, trump president, trump supposed control pandemic, not. Yep. mom died recently. telling people happened, way often hear ‚Äúbut 100% positive covid??! didn‚Äôt underlying issues?!?? know write covid people die get money.‚Äù 

People dicks. Mine 6 point. Yeah idk happened ü§°  government took seriously, draconian laws like even possible large populous country. It'd incentives keep people home. proper response would've lockdown keep people afloat stimulus make god damn virus political issue could get somewhat ok. Tragic really. friend mines husband passed recently, doctor sleep basement due self-quarantine (he infected, hospital precautions). One night suffered heart attacked passed, wife likely could saved sleeping bed. COVID taken lives ways thought aerosolized toilet activity enclosed space (airport office space, public bathroom) maybe meant ""stamped"" figurative sense, meaning inspected passport flagged along. confirm UK gone flames due cases wasteland now. like medical researchers funded tobacco companies repeatedly found smoking cigarettes poses health risks. even newsworthy airlines would make kind statement, would statement airlines even least credibility? ‚ÄúExponential hard‚Äù .. stuck first saw Reddit feb I‚Äôm conflicted. want understand tighter controls apparent significantly increased testing allowing China better control spread disease. outrages lack cooperation medical professionals country allowed pandemic spread take many lives across world.

That‚Äôs real conflict. shove bias westerners sun don‚Äôt shine. part comment offended you? doesn‚Äôt anything cold drier air.

It everything lack social distancing mask compliance. fact Germany, Korea China highly ranked really surprise. Germany Korea really model developed countries manage pandemic it‚Äôs good see countries learning them. Unfortunately quite aren‚Äôt that‚Äôs another story. mean it‚Äôs it‚Äôs common sense. many reports excess mortality beyond official covid death tolls since pandemic took Italy. places haven‚Äôt experienced (Japan New Zealand instance) official covid deaths relative populations. UK told government,

1) person person transmission
2) Masks work, airborne.
3) Offices schools ""COVID secure"" ^TM


The people giving COVID misinformation UK Conservative government. spike protein lab open closed position? accounted immune cloaking? immune downregulation virus capable of?

This meaningful result. Antibodies exist... one thinking don't. sucks don‚Äôt washer, save weeks masks family‚Äôs house once. Good thing 60 cloth masks, now. Nobody knew covid back then. took month two react. China 1.3 billions people friend, (4 times population US) 80k cases. reacted incompetently Trump administration, would four times cases US would ... 30 million cases.

Look condition China today, look like 30 million cases?  particular size infectious droplets, BFE. size neither single virus single bacterium. bacteria large, ones tend greatest concern like S. pneumoniae, S. aureus, N. meningitidis, S. pyogenes, etc. frequently 1 micron smaller.

It would seem filter materials tested 3 microns perform fine .1 microns usually, size particulates used standard.

Viral droplets usually much larger virus itself. Bacterial droplets. talking spray respiratory phlegm here, microbes flying around solo. problem is, ppl take numbers argue, death due lockdown. 

That happend me, mentioned excess death rate threat here. shows H1N1 epidemic Obama Biden mismanaged 2009 still causing deaths day.

[Do really need add sarcasm tag guys?] One facebook friends posted something cdc shows deaths gone recent years 2020 tract actually lower death rate. report shows opposite. saw cdc stuff, much wanted disprove said could find evidence. someone help find chart somewhere cdc sight shows 2020 deaths least 200,000 higher normal? Thank you. clearly easy answer fix science.

Madrid - 12 oct 2020 - 08:26 CEST

It raining last Friday Puerto de Santa Mar√≠a, Spain‚Äôs southern C√°diz province. Pablo del Pozo, music teacher local secondary school, asked student could close window. answered no, due coronavirus protocols. Del Pozo shared episode social media, along photograph showing wet window sill student desk placed centimeters away. post triggered deluge reaction.

Following coronavirus safety protocols, 23 students per classroom particular school, distance 1.5 meters desk. means students forced sit close windows. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs already cold, forced keep windows doors open prevent contagion. told it‚Äôs better child catch pneumonia Covid-19,‚Äù says Del Pozo, criticizes fact government come protocol class ventilation specifically adapted fall winter months.

The concern spreading across schools parts Spain scientific community last Monday warned risk coronavirus contagion indoor settings could nearly 20 times higher outdoors. Educators parents wondering manage proper ventilation preventing students feeling cold inside classrooms forced sit prolonged periods time.

ÔøºSecondary school students standing within designated area Aljaraque, Huelva province. 

The coronavirus protocol negotiated central regional health authorities contemplate different scenario winter. recommendations least 10 15 minutes ventilation beginning end school day, also recess classes. general, windows remain open ‚Äúas long possible.‚Äù regional governments Extremadura, Murcia, Andalusia Canary Islands recommended keeping doors windows open class well.

‚ÄúVentilating recess classes clearly insufficient,‚Äù explains Mar√≠a Cruz Minguill√≥n, researcher Spanish National Research Council (CSIC)'s Institute Environmental Assessment Water Research. ‚ÄúThe windows must stay open children must wear coat scarf necessary,‚Äù adds expert airborne aerosols.

Ever since schools reopened September, keeping doors windows open achieve cross ventilation reduce risk coronavirus transmission. far, 0.73% classrooms across country (around 2,300) shut due positive cases among students teachers, according Education Ministry.

But temperatures starting drop Spanish regions, particularly north, keeping windows open day becoming problem. B√°rbara Men√©ndez, deputy principal charge coronavirus management public school Asturias, reports ‚Äúchildren‚Äôs heads‚Äù situated right next windows, due safety protocols, always children cannot change desks. Last week, storm forced school roll window blinds halfway rain would ‚Äúcome pouring in.‚Äù Men√©ndez notes ‚Äúin Asturias, cold rainy weather eight months year.‚Äù

Researchers insisting need review school ventilation protocols, consider purchasing mechanical ventilation systems areas less benign weather conditions. ‚ÄúIf school thinking closing windows, use tools CO2 sensors air purifiers HEPA filters,‚Äù warns Minguill√≥n.

CO2 sensors, priced around ‚Ç¨35, detect concentration carbon dioxide air determine need fresh air reduce risk contagion. Air purifiers HEPA filters, cost around ‚Ç¨600 40-square-meter room, clean air removing contaminants.

Minguill√≥n translated Spanish ‚ÄúFive-Step Guide Checking Ventilation Rates Classrooms,‚Äù published Harvard School Public Health. expert warns buying CO2 sensor enough. ‚ÄúAfter that, make series calculations considering variables number students per classroom, age, volume cubic meters classroom, among others,‚Äù notes.

But many educators, terms CO2 sensors HEPA filters sound unfamiliar. Neither Health Education ministries mention protocols. regional governments, although considering adopting new ventilation methods weather turns cold.

Jordi Sunyer, head Childhood Environment Program Barcelona-based Institute Global Health one Spain‚Äôs top experts Covid-19 schools, believes country still lacks protocols establishing ventilate classrooms windows one. Sunyer believes cases, authorities consider options air purifiers HEPA filters. ‚ÄúThey filter ultrafine particles, capture viruses,‚Äù says. ‚ÄúThey portable, used one classroom, would necessary rooms without good natural ventilation.‚Äù

An unwanted choice

Faced shortage tools information, many teachers feel alone deal dilemma say hands. students cold class receive education subpar conditions, windows closed despite increased risk coronavirus contagion?

Some educators taken initiative. Francisco Espada, teacher C√°diz public secondary school Antonio de la Torre, first heard CO2 sensors air filters two weeks ago television program. since extensive online research advising school. ‚ÄúWe going buy several CO2 sensors check classrooms safe. principal thought good idea,‚Äù says.

But CSIC expert Minguill√≥n insists taking reading sensor enough: factors taken account, classroom volume number students it.

Esteban √Ålvarez, principal public secondary school Guadarrama mountains, Madrid region, already figured much cost keep windows open winter. normal season, school turns heating 7am turns 11.30am. comes around ‚Ç¨20,000 fill diesel tank. year, heating remain 2pm, bumping bill ‚Ç¨40,000.

‚ÄúWe already feel cold, starting open half windows. Nobody told us whether good idea buy air purifiers; subject addressed administration, improvise usual,‚Äù notes.

The school lot money anyway, explains: received additional check around ‚Ç¨50,000 government Madrid cover costs dealing pandemic, buying face masks, hand sanitizer, digital devices improving Wi-Fi connection.

Also, take parents side. Instead, said would help online orders feel stressed technology. find fascinating weird support China places comes this. 

You see everywhere, anti-Chinese government sentiment. they've treated Hong Kong citizens, they've locked millions camps, control literally every aspect daily life citizens. 

Did know even upload videos Chinese rip YouTube/Twitch, supply actual photo ID verify EXACTLY are? make type video comment critical government, go directly? insane draconian. 

But no, countless 100% verifiable completely awful illegal things Chinese government done continues do, COVID-19 virus line drawn. can't possibly lying that. Somehow, reason, strict censorship entire world, possibly lie virus. 

Just look numbers. even compared US. telling China handled completely unknown pandemic better island nations incredible healthcare? Take South Korea instance... 482 cases per million. New Zealand? 374 cases per million. 

China? origin virus with, like mentioned, insanely high population density? island? 59 cases per million. Fifty fucking nine. Per fucking million.

If use reddit extensions, I'd tag users obvious Chinese astroturf accounts. mean seriously, anyone thinks they're even 1% accurate drinking Kool Aid hard. Like can't believe gullible people are. Good you.

And good luck.

It depends lot Flu season behaves coming northern hemisphere winter. people take precautions COVID-19 light, lead less genetic diversity among different influenza strains. Even might go extinct. means take years see ""normal"" flu seasons again. 

This might interest Southern Hemisphere dodging flu bullet might create even one blind spot: Less circulating influenza virus means fewer clues genetic variants prevalent likely contribute next flu season. current record-low season creates genetic bottleneck, McCauley says, flu variants survive ‚Äúwill presumably fittest ones,‚Äù says.

2. ""Up to"" misleading. minimum value ""up to"" - people may less, people likely more. know much more, measured study, four months' worth data. one saying four months actual upper limit antibody protection.
3. effective vaccine designed provoke much stronger immune response, last longer. body want waste energy capacity producing antibodies something that's threat, generally stops producing antibodies perceives less severe threat sooner. fooling immune system perceiving huge fake threat, body super-vigilant real threat Covid shows up. even four months' antibody protection likely lead degree T-cell protection would last longer greatly reduce risk infection and, infection take hold, would also reduce risk severe symptoms.

Argentina amazing country, tourist fall love badly moved here. regrets. time covid end cheap visit here. economy crushing. definitely check out! specially recommend Patagonia :) anti-math correctly acknowledge #14 counties better worse - lot worse? countries worse used strategies countries better? saying Chinese government let dock workers get infected seafood, containment procedures routinely test dock workers, letting COVID spread rampantly, test entire city?

Nope. outbreak linked hospital treat imported cases like ones contracted dock workers exposed foreign it

No don't. making shit tsk China, look like managing imports well. Hey China makes fun USA for, handling well China exported USA? :P

They still better responding far better way U.S. 

With pooled testing resource intensive test huge groups low infection rates.

Stop intentionally ignorant nonsense make up. serves one. needs 212k upvotes, reminder. play down. idiot. get covid-19, may DIE. Get it? Actual death. EVERYONE's best interest blow completely proportion. think windows joke wrong assume town would burned also assume water stopped fire spreading would have. foregone scenario. 

Remember beginning told flattening curve wouldn‚Äôt reduce total number deaths infections spread time? don‚Äôt know many people would died directly virus nothing original assumption would end same. island doesn‚Äôt mean shit primary means dispersal around world air travel. logic, would thought Americas would huge advantage saw played out. wasn‚Äôt easy Never said couldn‚Äôt manage find it. questioning people offended someone asked evidence specific claim reluctant provide it. Last checked, bare minimum required making statement fact Reddit. Ok fair enough, zero evidence think true Mask home..... guy took retirement hobby.

So yea, really idea talking about. bar set low.... number people see taking handful random supplements suggesting taking handfuls random supplements unreal, without knowing persons diet specific nutritional could causing person harm saturation vitamins cause long lasting health problems. Yeah, right. Reading anything pass headline seems difficult people deny COVID numbers. helps nice graph page. know like pictures. conspiracy annoying. It‚Äôs always fixed, people need calm down. 

When diagnosed Covid, many outcomes. die, you‚Äôll counted Covid death proven otherwise. happened near someone confirmed case Covid died auto accident. died, moved death column. weeks, death certificate verified cause death removed numbers. 

It happens, it‚Äôs rare it‚Äôs fixed. doesn‚Äôt even come close matching deaths we‚Äôre missing. Every Bill Gates post idiotic comment like one ignorance full display. nowhere near close true. 

I know frightening, scientists disagree you. evidence even 8 billion people magically okay, 4 billion okay.

Well.. start study [UN performed almost 20 years stated carrying capacity planet ""in range 4 16 billion unspecified standard errors, median 10 billion"". could finish google search ""earths carrying capacity"" simple ""overpopulation"". Either provide ton information. 

This news! also controversial! scary people dislike talking it. vague ""future"" much easier focus immediate threats. Hey, brain built for! 

When get situation struggle produce enough food people start eating weird stuff. Maybe bats? Eventually starvation, war pandemic. Another pandemic. 

The typical response imminent threat ""technology!"" assumption something built/discovered/invented fix everything. see happening knows. Yes, point *have to* matter. think politicians able control this. Epidemiologists make decisions based science should. Looks good! really want fun learning, setup ML pipeline push pictures though age recognition. Then, group age brackets. Amazon easy ways sagemaker, machine pytorch/tensorflow Octave. one day next, went able ride bike hours without even sign gettibg winded struggling breathe sitting chair trying fall asleep. + big feeling weakness, + feeling cold, + almost general rona symptoms fought immediately

This cant anything rona, right? Dude, article April. recently came last week said longer support lockdowns. Educate embarrass further:

 Replies article cases DECLINING say governors policies suck. Right. supermarket interesting comparison, supermarket cafe used less garden centre cafe, 2 metre rule viable many. NHS app store entrance. given option scan stores QR code wish. Thank Bill. about, put money mouth is. better government. No? That's thought so... Thanks, I'm lucky manage financially, adapted husband started online business. careful taking vitamin lol.

Like New Zealand, live island I'm bit pissed local government, good could actually could control everyone entering. politics money affected it... Well look job losses unemployment rates US states strict lockdowns vs states little lockdowns, it‚Äôs pretty telling correlation. took away comment, ignorant purpose. recently death family. People nosy. ‚ÄúWas Covid-related?‚Äù first question nosier ones asked. don‚Äôt doubt answered yes, next thing would want know would pre-existing conditions risk factors. Shelter place = lockdown, existed many states reason pharma companies small incentive develop vaccines general. treatment ailment yield constant long term profits vaccine one time fix. Sure even need 2, 3, 4 doses still make tiny amount per dose.

And assuming world continue get covid vaccine, barely get vaccines world covid changed that. Africa non developed nations take years get vaccine ever get all.

A 2 week stay hospital make pharma hundreds times money vaccinating thousands people. selling PPE yield way profit. medical community corrupt high likelihood prognosis false due federal stimulus bill Medicare pay hospitals 20% standard rates COVID-19 defining case destructive policies Democrats liberals. literally put lives millions people around world stake!



Really, Federal Stimulus bill U.S. put lives people around world stake?

You also realize House Congress doesent force bills out? Republicans Senate vote approve them. President signs law. pleasure. quality life went lot stopped obsessing surfaces. Take care. ""extra COVID-19 deaths"" actually deaths due poor health care system people afraid going hospital due COVID-19, according article. would happened even US response virus better. 

The thing worth article research proof people color likely die preventable reasons systematic racism. primary example meant ""already accepted"". Anyone willing explain vaccine different may protect longer antibodies? confusing someone field. No, sudden pandemic big deal Biden's fault. Even scientists believe miracles. half Nobel peace prize winners Christians. Yes, even though smart, understand that. Thanks wisdom, Mr Jaw Breaker wonder ratio magnesium/vit people taking higher doses vitamin d. anyone else actually read this?

It's misleading title 36% extra attributed depression caused lockdown, people dying diseases they're afraid get covid going hospital, etc.

You can't attribute deaths coronavirus want to... It‚Äôs refreshing see genuine conversation it‚Äôs ok change mind strain corona virus came animal source infected humans. flu virus around quite independent covid-19. summary they're different, flu become Covid-19 nothing 1 25 year olds strokes. projection model prefer? always looked longer updated. automatically mean mutate become deadly either. digging. Basically, answer ""we know"" Viruses evolve become less deadly, found evidence really support whether higher chance becoming less deadly. evolve become better vectors multiply. There's one virus seen evolve become less deadly, that's rabbit virus australia. also seen become deadly well.(the myxoma virus) It‚Äôs twisted truth. Medicare set prices treatment order efficient. go hospital, regardless reason, Medicare pay based diagnostic code. help less money, make profit. costs more, lose money. amount chosen average many factors taken account. Yes, also set price Covid treatment. way, true. Hospitals get paid Covid treatments. It‚Äôs unfair ignore get paid set rate *all* patients. difference, ill take mask 10 minutes, whilst eating?

That's huge difference though.

1. maskless.
2. people around also maskless. masks reduce intake expulsion virus 2/3 each, that's 9√ó exposure per second.
3. people sitting moving around. supermarket aisle, might within 2m someone perhaps 10 seconds moving. person next table sharing space you, spend 20 minutes cafe, 600 seconds/10 min. total exposure 9√ó per second, 60√ó longer - 500:1 difference. That's huge. ask anything? 

Does name calling make feel better? It‚Äôs okay does, take it. hell called corona virus ‚Äòhoax‚Äô? Oh yeah, Trump.

But don‚Äôt care context it. care fact said jt,, go thinking Trump said simply doesn‚Äôt care dead family, I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs exactly said it. bet Trump glad family dead. He‚Äôs sort person. Trump said wants everyone‚Äôs family die virus. told Hitler v2, let bunch military die Benghazi ignoring plea help, helps pedofiles rapists island owns, he‚Äôs worst. everything us vs them.

You clearly paying attention... LITERALLY cases. fucking virus political. Medical treatments political. repeat maybe understand it: medical treatments political.

Its us (with facts) vs (with bullshit). wish wasn't, is. Everything is. fucking sad morons stand proud ignorance literally ignore facts reality.

Their ignorance truly bliss them... dragging everyone else down. one longest hardest lockdowns usually use vpn shit. Literally overnight, deth toll approaching 100k, daily death count dropped ~2k ~5-600, eben though number new cases per day still rising. Either sudden breakthrough int treatment, found way fudge numbers.

And that's consider whole mess healthcare US; many people never even sought treatment (and hence become statistics) simply afford it? done, without exceptions. Look South Korea, seem know it. sub:

WHY CANT EVERYONE STAY FUCK HOME

&amp;#x200B;

Also sub:

What lockdowns? go wherever want? lot said hinges exclusively response. comment worded way implies option shut down. isn‚Äôt case never shut pandemic before. Even Spanish Flu economy grew, pandemic nowhere near one terms per capita deaths. comparable pandemics 1957 1968 also create problems outside pandemic itself. 

The one negative consequence started intention prevent overwhelming hospitals. Two weeks slow spread. accomplished, everything completely new territory effects would cause unknown. showed face someone dead c19 1 second, 210k dead, video would 58 hours 20 minutes long. There‚Äôs also need fucking asshole suicidal person believe recommendation outdated. date definitive case surface lead transmission. ""There clear cases COVID-19 fomite transmission found literature."" naturally sit around 20's (Sri Lankan background), took 2 tablets day (2 x 1000 IU) many months got 50 (which lowest possible normal score get Australian lab ranges). taking 4/day kicked off. levels rechecked, though. It‚Äôs Trump, Pence, Pence‚Äôs Fly labs running tests experiments. Duh. \*laughs Czech\*

Not really yes course Christmas. Germany Britain could stop firing trenches 1914 celebrate it, learn adapt year keep alive WSJ, Vox, Fox News, BBC name want shit over.

Oh, that's insertion problem injection inhalation. suppository fix right up!   stinking Liberals want poison Conservatives chemtrails? 5G level bullshit, especially since COVID hoax created Democrats collusion China order bring God King Trump Yes look China's lockdown there. Completely eliminated virus month back normal. ... really believe that? Social distancing sucks sound like r/collapse user sub filled bunch frightened sheep like you. Also, mods fucking gay Chinese speech blocking shills you‚Äôve ever bench humid rink, see everyone‚Äôs breath everywhere directions.

While I've watched hockey, realized quickly game they're ice brief stints. must among taxing sports there. He's really random billionaire worthless opinion matter know, he's kind expert. Non live vaccines safe, regular flu vaccine actually recommended normal pregnancy. no, seriously doubt would qualify. home test! Check pixel labcorp mean does, 4 combined lower number deaths per capita U.S. Exactly ‚Äì comorbidities multiply odds, odds 58yr old dying low...

Sure, obese people might 50% higher chance, 1% fatality rate age bracket bumps 1.5% mean idea Jobs stole Xerox? way, Jobs create damn thing rested genius Steve Wozniak actually engineer beginnings Apple. fact, Jobs never created anything. amazing promoter marketer, innovator. 

Furthermore, Gates God knows many scientists, virologists, epidemiologists employed foundation. gonna give credence say internet keyboard warrior like you. Good point. worry Covid-free? Nothing bad possibly happen. Nah, mosquitoes live, bats eat mosquitoes, get happening ;) think one big issues bias coverage conservative media.

There study revealed, nobody's surprise, watch Fox News conservative radio, consistently told Covid blown administration going great job. Unless seek sources, know know.

Also, many people equipped deal information goes believe want believe. difficult convince somebody something can't accept. always excuses, reasons ignore facets candidate, example. sad. ‚ÄúKate Bingham, head UK‚Äôs vaccine task force, warned around 50% population receive one.‚Äù

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs going vaccination people 18,‚Äù Bingham told Financial Times, adding: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs adult-only vaccine, people 50, focusing health workers care home workers vulnerable.‚Äù 

Is fact? average person 34.... won‚Äôt get it? don‚Äôt like sound Kate makes sense - 18 - 50? say 50s + care/health workers vulnerable?  Yes, when?

Normalization catching us vaccines still seem faraway.

We talking Oct. Nov.

Now Oct. talking Jan.

It's really depressing still practice social distancing anti-infection measures. YEAR 2525 #**Sometimes fucking hate country...** like know gyms find sanitizing wipes. cannot find going multiple times week 3 months now. wife also. one house Rona. I‚Äôm gonna keep going gym. guarantee right return? Canada isn‚Äôt exactly sending best people south border might want upgrade gene pool option. Ice rinks actually excellent ventilation.  chillers zambonies give carbon monoxide. poorly ventilated ice rink give everyone CO poisoning pretty quickly.

The main problem hockey involves lot deep, heavy breathing. you‚Äôve ever bench humid rink, see everyone‚Äôs breath everywhere directions. come back? Yes. kids 6 8. entire lives we‚Äôve tried minimize screen time. Sure, iPads. use 30 minutes day less, average. 

We‚Äôre parents always said: Play toys. iPad today. Go outside. 

Now that‚Äôs thrown window. school requires stare screens 4-6 hours per day. 

This hoped public education would go children. Wtf entomologist going tell you?! South Korea partial one China one strictest lockdowns early on. sure they're good examples avoid one.

They've succeeded followed benefits lockdown measures like mass testing plus contact tracing quarantines/isolations, mask mandates enforcing social distancing requirements. August.

Put everything together assumption somewhere order 350m deaths US due covid now.

If sane lockdown, testing, tracing healthcare put place could 10k deaths. Boris Johnson start welding people inside flats. Lol bad made typo. 2, 1.my bad there. still doesnt change sth pregnant woman isn‚Äôt medically unsafe position?  wrong though, willfully ignorant real reason high number deaths Yes, could sending tweet storm inching closer closer grave. even tweet crossing threshold. countries locked point low prevalence virus there. lockdown won‚Äôt work America anymore virus prevalent. worlds longest severe lockdown, er martial law.

Regardless, need see positive vaccine signals ASAP. saved money elderly care past workers move around facilities. Basically allowing rapid spread homes weakest risk dying covid population live. why. realized already late seems go-to someone says something outside Borg agrees cant believe movie got number right!  depends where. seemed work well Australia, NZ places reopened slowly listened science (e.g SF) kept indoor dining closed. Also, lockdowns reduced number infections many places, least temporarily. What's alternative letting virus overwhelm hospitals kill millions leave billions long lasting symptoms organ damage? wants? yet countries best shape used sort lockdown and/or closed borders.

And there's every European country experiencing second wave despite locking down. Clearly lockdowns solve nothing. know RT Russian Times - Putin‚Äôs propaganda engine. Nothing RT worth believing, especially comes America. best friend teaches Chinese kids English internet. telling experiences COVID happening first. remember telling quarantined. remember us saying, ""Can imagine live like that? fear virus every day stay home time? That's gotta hard!""

Then came 2020. like..""Welp.."" Except places without big economic mental problems countries locked early locked hard.

But interested Mr. Nabarro's opinion, yours. ""Oops, uh...let us try again."" Italy 60 million people, France uk 60 million each, spain 40 million

You Google Wikipedia it, straightforward easily accessible info lol drake CHOOSING come back US...


Smart man Yes, pretty much this. Washing underwear every use wasteful harmful ecosystem. usually good least 3 4 uses. admit I‚Äôve providing fake number reason.  Zero privacy controls whatsoever. Restaurants open everyone allowed choose eat not. Lol

So true. since there's nothing else watch, decided watch recent episode. actually flicker hope. Could episode legit? pied piper scene night, quickly faded. comes complicated situations, either side argument correct information help back ideology. That‚Äôs it‚Äôs complicated.

Unfortunately certain politicians don‚Äôt care what‚Äôs correct, run *wish* correct, let‚Äôs pretend simple situation. Yes, can't link directly chart comparing specific countries. said, thanks *you*, I've dug little deeper found cases/million graph: btw, makes much easier debunk argument. European country ICU filled full capacity. mean? irony I‚Äôm required employer get flu vaccine every year. Conservatives strange people. ‚ÄúGods done‚Äù lmfao  good day otherwise? driver deserves statue US Constitution 13th amendment endorses Slavery:
""Neither slavery involuntary servitude, except punishment crime whereof party shall duly convicted, shall exist within United States, place subject jurisdiction.""

So much freedumb. 9 months intense study every leading virology lab earth, still figured long lives? Really? Swedish approach COVID-19 nothing else clear, consistent, transparent, yeah. That's I'm asking he's getting at, United Kingdom ain't better Sweden terms metrics approach damn place. makes much sense now. elementary school got nasal flu vaccine, good amount kids mild symptoms following it. brief, mild fever headache next day.  US wouldn‚Äôt border closed all, way. 

Canada keeping border closed northbound traffic. US saying it‚Äôs mutual decision don‚Äôt appear weak, numerous border-state senators asked Trump administration reopen border. 

Canada isn‚Äôt it. 

Canadians fly south US want, however upon returning home they‚Äôre subject strict, mandatory, 14 day quarantine period. 

I‚Äôve numerous family friends go now. can‚Äôt go walks. can‚Äôt get groceries. stay within boundaries states property 14 days, aren‚Äôt allowed visitors. check repeatedly quarantine period make sure haven‚Äôt violated it. 

Something like isn‚Äôt enforceable tourists, aren‚Äôt allowed in. three day trip Whistler would require stay 17 days, 14 spent locked room. There‚Äôs point, there‚Äôs already Americans trying violate direct-transit exemption Alaska, Canada rightfully isn‚Äôt willing allow large influx people come country control health crisis. 

So, summarize, reason Canadians fly US wants tourists. reason border closed Canada wants closed. . . . That‚Äôs exactly Ruskies want us dumb Americans think! 

XD lol 

Americans large moronic people, would know one them. find blood draws painful extremely uncomfortable, shit load vaccines including one literally 2 days ago basically dont feel slight sting seconds mild ache hours. Depends many infections area. admit also going bit hard surfaces eased bit. Yes, science says ""You're increasing chance kill next / neighbour"". Jesus says ""Don't then""  Absolutely. head would explode. One really...

I actually watch Fox ""News"" every days see what's said. said, take small amounts one time. Sad comes Government first letter ‚ÄúF‚Äù followed several letters (several TWO, less infinity) r u saying Sounds reasonably likely given symptoms. Isolated you. matters. Sheesh life currently nation, anywhere, people taught encouraged think critically? Schultz cartoon comes mind. Linus quest something similar educators never reach us resist. Can't wait antivaxxers hear one. *insert leonardo dicaprio laughing meme* Bill who? What‚Äôs difference asymptomatic confirmed? Actually, there's research showing inside mouth much vulnerable. Lol, Japan one oldest populations world. sure many states go quite hard before. Many can't afford without federal funding. whole not-caring thing unfortunately good thing. everybody cared least bit, maybe places could stay open indefinitely. remains seen happen US think cases continue grow November. see much sense trying advocate people returning normal post-vaccine. find articles counterproductive. type shit helps foment greater level anti-vax sentiment. Yes paper towels concoction spray bottle. really doubt even sanitizer. Probably Lemon Pledge.  I‚Äôd punch that. Maybe duel. choice. Swords!  love daggers. irony bringing death plague upon flouting science, makes one shake head. Considering they've endured community irony palpable. spanish flu changed behavior.

All pandemics change posting message asking issue instructed you.

Can please help explain issue is?

You deleted whole lot posted without explaining issue is, confused. Yea. Also half bars restaurants choose from. they‚Äôre half capacity outside. 

And half classes kindergarten college taken computers. 

Most Sports 0-25% capacity fans attendance. 

Millions unemployed

But yea, seems pretty much business usual Its. A. New. Coronavirus. To. Humans. 

If something new, know EVERYTHING first appears? America #1 everything. course know tell ignorance ""It's .5% bro!"". expect anything someone thinks either causes death, nothing. like contagion. Wonder they'll come wrist bands getting surprises much people don't. wear shirt pants every day would wear mask? toss mine bucket washer. bucket fills, get washed either hand washer, dry bathroom. keep coming sub clearly makes agitated? lockdown properly, get infection rate low enough, impliment proper test trace lockdowns solve nothing.

Good see agree me, understand rest post now. work people still believe death toll false probably 6-10% truly covid. frustrating #üôÉ love word bollocks thing. Thank British. would really like move Canada Australia. learn new language much culture shock, deal bullshit living US. seem fit personality anyway. 

To people say ""IF LIKE COUNTRY GET FUCK OUT!!!"", problem nobody let us in!!!! Yes. answer widespread infections contained significant testing contact tracing process, successful vaccine program place, stop getting complacent. Accept masks, hand washing, distancing (6‚Äô so), large indoor gatherings new norm. Always. Outbreak not. Quit pretending clear. Right virus like toxic pollen - might ok today knows what‚Äôs going bloom tomorrow. takes one infected person visiting town BOOM. Outbreak. could pick one country know real impact (besides US since home me), would definitely china. 84000 ass. leader telling people ignore deadly disease. Get life. Going restaurant anarchy. mean lot people needles phobia. definition makes irrational. 

I personally hate needles, always have, always will. I'm phobia stage I'd suffer getting it. worst one actually watching blood get drawn, made almost pass times.

Fun fact: kid scared nurse giving injection moved hand injected herself. Looking back clear gonna inject pretty hard able inject herself. People meet private. better? bunch people family covid back early september i'm worried  topic experience PrEP? downsides taking it, side effects etc? 

## Significance

The previous lack consensus around use hydroxychloroquine COVID-19 patients underlines need thoroughly assess vivo efficacy drugs SARS-CoV-2. Small animal infection models, hamster model, pivotal place herein. show vivo preclinical results favipiravir indicate antiviral efficacy SARS-CoV-2 might achieved high dose. Hydroxychloroquine, hand, completely lacks antiviral activity, thus providing scientific basis use COVID-19 patients. study two key antiviral candidates, establish baseline SARS-CoV-2 antiviral treatment, allow us identify superior antiviral candidates near future.

## Abstract

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) rapidly spread around globe emergence Wuhan December 2019. specific therapeutic prophylactic options available, virus infected millions people half million succumbed viral disease, COVID-19. urgent need effective treatment together lack small animal infection models led clinical trials using repurposed drugs without preclinical evidence vivo efficacy. established infection model Syrian hamsters evaluate efficacy small molecules infection transmission. Treatment SARS-CoV-2‚àíinfected hamsters low dose favipiravir hydroxychloroquine with(out) azithromycin resulted in, respectively, mild reduction virus levels. However, high doses favipiravir significantly reduced infectious virus titers lungs markedly improved lung histopathology. Moreover, high dose favipiravir decreased virus transmission direct contact, whereas hydroxychloroquine failed prophylaxis. Pharmacokinetic modeling hydroxychloroquine suggested total lung exposure drug cause failure. data hydroxychloroquine (together previous reports macaques ferrets) thus provide scientific basis use drug COVID-19 patients. contrast, results favipiravir demonstrate antiviral drug nontoxic doses exhibits marked protective effect SARS-CoV-2 small animal model. Clinical studies required assess whether similar antiviral effect achievable humans without toxic effects. Brain fog real! biggest symptom everyone know Covid. I‚Äôll say sounds similar surviving TB. Almost exactly. hope symptoms covid eventually go away. tuberculosis, permanent. wonder would put warning one new covid.. No, actively support crap Saw airport Friday. Flights Canada day U.S. airport. said countries lockdown experiencing rising cases rising deaths, offered counterpoint. Us too. annoying fuck else do? Would types things less wasteful too? Literally write word word comment. venture capital business invest many cool eco friendly startups runs Gates Foundation contributes many humanitarian causes. Right? society lost collective memory viral illnesses damage often leave wake. 80 year old father‚Äôs friend still limp polio. Kids survived mumps, went deaf. people don‚Äôt exist frequently anymore we‚Äôve forgotten viruses scary even don‚Äôt usually kill you. 

Warning: following anecdote. 

So couple friends diagnosed COVID March. early cases. Neither long haulers per se, weird symptoms turned months later. heart skipping beats, slight tremor hand. 

So finally go go bunch tests doctors. initially gets diagnosed MS. looks really bad MRI. MS triggered virus, didn‚Äôt seem COVID specific first. Except went MS specialist says it‚Äôs _not_ MS super puzzled condition. Finally, almost whole day testing, says ‚ÄúDid COVID?‚Äù nods finality, says ‚Äúthis definitely isn‚Äôt MS.‚Äù He‚Äôs enrolled tracking studies now. 

His wife also appears completely separate also autoimmune disorder, case rheumatoid arthritis. Except ‚Äúit doesn‚Äôt look like RA they‚Äôve ever seen before‚Äù. 

I think we‚Äôre tip big iceberg discovering complications arise virus. already know Kawasaki‚Äôs-like syndrome children. many things going trigger? point, hope it‚Äôs scaring shit people who‚Äôve anti-science now. Science thing save us mess we‚Äôve gotten into. Stop using Micros~1.sht Excel then. say many countries  migrant farm laborers [...] began fall ill rate 11 times health workers

Meanwhile, viable virus isolated 28 days 20 ¬∞C common surfaces

CDC risk getting sick COVID-19 eating handling food (including frozen food produce) food packages considered low.

Yeah, right. really see farm workers sanitising hands wearing masks. Oh, I'm mostly normal.

It crazy think covid change things. Yeah wont immortals anymore. 

## Abstract

Background: Biomarkers predict Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) outcome early infection urgently needed improve prognosis treatment. Zinc balances immune responses also proven direct antiviral action viruses. Importantly, zinc deficiency (ZD) common condition elderly individuals chronic diseases, two groups severe COVID-19 outcomes. hypothesize serum zinc content (SZC) influences COVID-19 disease progression thus might represent useful biomarker. Methods: run retrospective observational study 249 COVID-19 patients admitted Hospital del Mar. studied COVID-19 severity progression attending SZC admission. parallel studied SARS-CoV2 replication Vero E6 cell line modifying zinc concentrations. Findings: study demonstrates correlation serum zinc levels COVID-19 outcome. Serum zinc levels lower 50 mcgg/dl admission correlated worse clinical presentation, longer time reach stability higher mortality. vitro results indicate low zinc levels favor viral expansion SARS-CoV2 infected cells. Interpretation: SZC novel biomarker predict COVID-19 outcome. encourage performing randomized clinical trials study zinc supplementation potential prophylaxis treatment people risk zinc deficiency.  Let fucking die Good thing NZ able control Influenza every year due geography low population.... wait... So? Research shown somewhat protective wearer well, even not, masks ever prevent infected (and often asymptomatic) people spreading virus use them? Cool. Lock everyone everything forever. way. study don‚Äôt really say percentage asymptomatic cases eventually develop symptoms, really bug me. shit makes sick stomach. Losing best us, working hardest jobs, neglect. Hospitals doubled corona staff halved working hours save thier people infection, overwork, ptsd. Instead seems like nothing, simply let cash roll in. Please correct I'm wrong, looking outside situation seems almost untenable long run. No. preaches supported Dr. Fauci, Dr. Offit, Dr. Redfield ‚Äî ***experts***. shit would know? mean, jew here, non religious. definitely agree guys cult religion.

Unless say religions cults necessarily disagree with. cynical side thinks deniers going regret stance. 

The logical side wonders awareness contract virus. know Bill days, you? would. COVID live reasonably OK surfaces awhile, exposure soaps high temps (dryer) quickly. country started seeing spikes ? I‚Äôm Brazil it‚Äôs steady 30k cases day... Wonder even first place. False positive. want N95 mask, thanks. Kristi ~~Noem~~ DeSantis get lot attention, stands around nothing brags successful is. hope need ask ""elite class so-called experts"" assistance, like medical advice use field morgues hospitals get overrun... lot data web sites say numbers cases, numbers recovered numbers tested. really accurate know exactly many infected many yet infected. Also hard know many asymptomatic therefore never get tested. guess good mine.

I'd guess 2 percent 15 percent population infected. Every time lift restrictions travel social gatherings, new case rates test positivity rates go quickly, indicating lot people yet infected. I'd guess 85 90 percent population yet infected. And, unclear people could re-infected people infected later test negative could become contagious months years later. get close enough 100%, might well skip tests altogether! starting ease back cleaning surfaces. Whatever happened Star Trek needleless injector used back 70‚Äôs Swine Flu vaccination administered countrywide? business ventures going start making money post presidency?

Lockdown happened Wuhan, Victoria state parts Italy. individuals movement seriously restricted it‚Äôs lockdown book  Make sure take account everyone need two shots would politics delay vaccine? certain parties clearly interested speeding process, know delay politics? Lmao There's enough sarcasm cure disease! would lockdowns making tricky.

Where? Nobody locked right now. shit, probably goes lot countries. Mostly less developed countries prefer fact fiction speculation unfortunately Covid actually appears people‚Äôs doorsteps they‚Äôre ignorant health crisis.
It‚Äôs way people see don‚Äôt believe . That's great idea, except cells ace 2 receptors, know, mouth, stomach, small intestine... They‚Äôre completely right, covid doesn‚Äôt kill us. 
Ignorance, ignorance kills us, sadly ignorance goes beautifully well covid. Oof. Bringing back bad memories elementary school got free flu nasal mist vaccines. Everyone sick within two weeks üòÇ one ten people left class third week get vaccine ended becoming sick like everyone else anyways. Fun times That's nice 5th grade essay, I'm afraid deserves F. really better research instead using Reddit sure still stocked found 3M N95s website. Hope helps out. safe there! 
 
www.ohanamedicalsupply.com thought gone forever there..... lock country 100 However, growing evidence fomite transmission incredibly rare happens all

How growing evidence? [This Australian study discussed finds *viable* virus, something shown previous studies I've seen, much *month* certain surfaces, temperature higher 20¬∞C. half life lot shorter that, avoided presence UV, still much higher numbers seen previous studies, constant objection studies ""But show *viable* virus!

Well, have. Take wallet money credit cards it: often temperatures exceeding 20¬∞C, dark little UV, mostly taken indoors, little UV. **Oct. 12, 00:00 (UTC+9)**

The problem U.S. none would acceptable certain groups. that's U.S. way cases deaths. could joined together sacrificed million instead 280k. hoping for? Czech, threatening us lockdown too. Lockdown, curfew, whatever. last ting announced ban free time activities.  


Like hell gonna comply. Closing pubs isn‚Äôt lockdown bro. think handle But, CDC report said 6% died Covid alone! /s Surpressed long, weeks most? . case, knowing understanding going wanting report misinformation could likely motivation.

The US know bat virus human jumps, funded part bat virus research work wuhan lab. fact pulled funding later US. issue china tbh, learnt sars, put things place. response far faster previous outbreaks even response wasnt smooth fast enough. learn covid19 put things place detect next outbreak faster.

The issue everyone else watched coming almost nothing even started communities. Every advanced country plans place pandemics. known risk. black swan pandemics politicians decided follow plan.

If whole result post panademic postmortem blame China boy fucked next one. slave labour unethical immoral. Prisoners prison serve time. punishment; work free labour city, government, corporations.

If corrective work order, judge decide give part punishment.

Slavery still well alive. add extra layer hide it. one even larger, estimate 45k daily cases comparison 17k official cases England. study asymptomatic cases 86% asymptomatic cases would mean whole lot cases 45k per day. major. would royally pissed closed one visit. scary. chance sort thing happening keeps taking many precautions possible. Hm, see. know pursue safety first foremost, I'm glad are. want badly, especially since feel like country really screwed virus response. Anyways, Pfizer approved here, mean approval would quick follow US, would still complete trials whatnot here? really know whole process works.  Freedom religion exist there's freedom practice religion. explain think cases data says horrible shape.

Because deaths paint much better picture gravity virus, moment, they're MUCH lower before: say bad, say believed benefit mass scale seen evidence yet back March? Hint- extremely specific reason. err side caution dealing novel threats.

In UK, told detrimental wear necessary prevent hospitals run much Europe learn guys shape up.

There many countries overrun hospitals implement lockdowns. Sweden's hospitals saying pointless.

No, saying **not necessary stop hospitals trying distract actual conversation hand goin need clear linking conversation saying, ""What human rights?""

The right protest / freedom assembly gone UK since gatherings 6 illegal. know fuck talking about. 

But edited response. repost want. this: reminder month now, covid election, (everyone see this, screenshot it) say right. virus still ""after election"", agree taken right-wing, lying propaganda change view Like hell hand personal data. business go pub. where. mine.  crossover event coronavirus unknown. know that. saying it‚Äôs last resort.

Keep hoping. Things look good We've come already lengthy lockdown cases live UK

You joking, right? [These new cases per 

Please explain think cases data says horrible question, countries saying great job seemed know do.

That isolation/quarantine infectious disease pretty basic playbook follow. anything specific listen said face masks bad, told false information punished listening them.

Did say bad, say believed benefit mass scale seen evidence yet back March?

Hint- extremely specific reason.

This err side caution dealing novel never said lockdowns effective, said necessary true.

They necessary prevent hospitals run much Europe learn guys shape they're not, would case made claim, disprove non-existent claim.

You mean like cleaning would work surely wouldn‚Äôt worked though let‚Äôs real here, two months would right back way two months. wanted give businesses (trumps cronies) money strings instead paying people thought virus replicates quite well throat.

Also, chewing major source aerosols sure, 10 inches lungs. Hey posting everyone else blamed trump. There‚Äôs response? half right. lot people don‚Äôt care, rightfully so. many things cause extraordinary amount deaths deem OK. amount (and will) cause everyone arms about. Like (as example cause don‚Äôt exact numbers atm) 25,000 deaths ok something 40,000 shut world. (I get exact numbers wrong, gets point across though)

In opinion covid line = shut world. I‚Äôm good running it‚Äôs course way allow many things year year. I‚Äôm sick tired seeing blatant trolling every single daily thread. You‚Äôre breaking rules mods aren‚Äôt anything either nobody making care they‚Äôre okay fear-mongering. 

All I‚Äôm reporting consistently breaking rules. Nothing wrong that. Today's total cases high covering two days. Remember, Florida report anything yesterday one labs use dumped 400K records mostly duplicates lap, remove duplicate records. Sunday's total actually Saturday Sunday's totals combined. really response? 

Really? ""duh, get life"". come on. That's far stupid pretty pathetic. 

Let ask - actual argument main point? serious, ""go away election"". 

How this: reminder month now, covid election, (everyone see this, screenshot it) say right. virus still ""after election"", agree taken right-wing, lying propaganda change view things? 

deal? Lockdowns last resort type thing... People taking vacations want exposed virus either severely impact health lead death.

False. countries either closed entirely, extremely strict tourist visa restrictions eligibility requirements, closed countries others, mandatory 14-day quarantines, making taking vacation either impossible entirely pointless.

You see worldwide update here: also runs color coded world map: look like world open tourism?

Also - one primary concerns travelers constantly changing policies. wants travel ""open"" country shut case explosion become nightmare get home. book trip September, restrictions change October.

Lockdowns created world nobody knows rules change. Governments change policy whenever feel like, based whatever criteria want, making entirely unattractive tourists.

And sure, add people scared catching virus. world opened entirely permanently today, tourism would skyrocket. 0 doubt. like city opened bars, packed next day, even though city's Reddit sub said one would go even open. think it‚Äôs important look DOH stats. many cases, 100k tests. They‚Äôre counting tests/new cases number. It‚Äôs roughly 3.5%. I‚Äôm damn best optimistic. (I fully agree death sentence opened everything up.) result massive testing instance seems. may right, see attitude towards masks often I‚Äôd like to. It‚Äôs nothing sway people directly affected it. South Korea... reCAPTCHA test post reddit happy NZ got cases again? I‚Äôm actually relieved found sane people daily threads lately...gives hope sadly completely believe excess death rates, jump draw line income inequality race bit stretch. That‚Äôs best, correlation rather contributing causing factor. 

They mention counties high income inequality, high population density, large percentage minorities hit hardest. There‚Äôs absolutely contributing factors, counties also city immediately city adjacent counties. virus known worse higher density populations early shouldn‚Äôt surprise. Cities also highest income inequality large percentage bipoc residents. Hey everybody, report every person threatens report ***friends***, *targeted harassment*.

I think end day, we're far assessments pandemic. 

I'm frustrated ""plus/minus"" data much. There's anywhere 35 million cases 800 million cases. total number deaths one million, maybe two million. real statistician would look and... GIGO (garbage in, garbage out.) personal philosophy includes ""Something better nothing"". However, I've seen several comments Reddit importance getting air purifiers right capacity space might something research? Best luck you! merely agreeing headline article, expanding deathtoll. direct acknowledgment of, agreement with, article... opposite deflection... nice wanna talk 59 day old account, ready shut up? say *more* likely talking increase .0002 percent .0004? Technically that's twice likelihood, sounds dramatic, realize unlikely sort transmission begin with. Well, isnt it? ""plague rats"" lol! right keep away Babe! doubt it. headlines pretty awful live here. second wave 6 weeks ago downward curve now.

It's different people say west alienated Alberta pissed. would direct result Trump administration stealing resources Democratic states give Republican states. Nobody close died, know friends immediate family have.

Not mention live state hasn‚Äôt really opened since beginning. think looting complete societal collapse bit far fetched, look America... (yes it‚Äôs bad film, happening reasons too, film isn‚Äôt far off) Don‚Äôt mistake following believe disease serious almost certainly worse anything since Spanish flu 100 years ago. also one anti-mask nut jobs best self quarantine. 

I really want take total average deaths 2010-2019 compare 2020.  two big things think could show. First would expose likely 10s thousands died without tested. Second would end excluding would likely died average year things like flu. Since rightfully hyper focused Covid attributing deaths Covid flu would classified different cause death. example flu kills aids patient 2019 would marked aids primary cause death aids patient killed Covid marked Covid death. source 3 friends 5 family members nurses doctors 3 different local hospitals grain salt. trying minimize disease interesting imperfect comparison. exactly. Lockdown New York took us epicenter world one lowest infection rates country. well testing containing, certain groups refusing follow basic guidelines caused higher rate certain limited areas. areas lockdowns stop spread. never convince lockdowns don‚Äôt work.

We managed keep essential services going may caused longer lockdown, one starved. even free food distribution children adults various schools. Ok, sure. Neither Germany. don‚Äôt think western countries realistically lock like China Vietnam unless islands, I‚Äôm sure ever option. prefix ‚Äòultra‚Äô implies extremism &amp; Ulta-orthodox Brooklyn Jewish population whole Jewish religion, sect. Extremely strict religious adherence &amp; rejection modern culture creates extremely insular environment many practices beliefs considered outsiders strange sinister. instance, people born cult allowed learn English despite living city English common language causing car accidents refuse adhere modern traffic safety rules. That's experience all. think kind cuts across ages/ethnicities/body types. Inconceivable vague anecdote doesn‚Äôt amount argument problem is, government worse under-react (the White House actively interfered state efforts mitigate virus) still many Americans act like actually over-reacted! also, many extra people died year normally die year. fatalities worry about, though. There's long term, possibly permanent, damage impact people.  NYC. densely populated place country. red zones temporary positivity goes down. abuse rampant. offense taken, I'm German. little funny, Berlin famous ""unfriendly"" sarcastic. people Berlin might travel Munich take part Oktoberfest, vast majority would want associated it. 

None self-explanatory, good. Visit Munich Berlin - places too. :) know... Wishful thinking. sad ability parse relevant scientific data days rare. failing say that? known awhile captured excess mortality numbers. detract report rather detract misinformation going out. known months hospitals declaring deaths pneumonia far excess expected mortality testing covid shit ton time.


When see 50% spikes pneumonia deaths areas small nonexistent increases COVID cases fuck think happening? best analogy heard getting stabbed. stab bleed out, cause death blood loss... technically knife scot free! decided go ‚Äúherd immunity‚Äù approach distributing PPE would interfere rapid spread. Trump told Woodward knew highly contagious, airborne, deadly February. Trump reportedly asked repeatedly meetings ‚ÄúWhy can‚Äôt let go population?‚Äù Trump Kushner interfered mask distribution repeatedly different ways. Trump made wearing mask loyalty test guaranteeing followers would wear masks. Trump pushed aggressive reopening country knowing virus could do. 

It‚Äôs time stop accepting he‚Äôs dumb doesn‚Äôt believe science. (He dumb immoral). different agenda interests American public. don‚Äôt want die, doesn‚Äôt care lose 1-10% population, especially that‚Äôs likely deaths people won‚Äôt vote him. talk miracle cures vaccines meant calm people sell something die. It‚Äôs creating panic important. figured going ‚ÄúSwedish strategy‚Äù protests riots would 50x larger. Ummm. Okay? Nope, listen CDC research think makes sense already think, rest fake. I'm talking people told doctor get vaccine. talking Karens read Facebook vaccine Bill Gates trick put trackers blood.

As point out, people can't get vaccine, need get it. lot people die stupid people think wait get sick take vaccine. I'd put money post viral inflammation. I've fair share systemic inflammation really stupid things flares up. Almost burned building level stupid zone really easily. totally understand frustration. friend mine, spread misinformation Covid. posted every source could find urged exercise caution pointing flaws thinking. convinced right contrarian.

The hardest part distancing situation letting think themselves. Similar study done Mexico months ago. used municipal death records document excess deaths compared previous years government wasn‚Äôt identifying covid. Pretty cool research Nobody stop Brazil ! Go Brazil win this!! Brazil #1 country üòéüáßüá∑ Can't tell affirming denying systemic racism. that's almost impossible. 

they either getting paid pretend accept severity situation. mental issue. identity issue. 

people's knowledge world centered around biases makes identity. knowledge wrong cause identity crisis. many people choose ignore things refuting know. Exactly. Plus reinfected cases, still lot learn....even rare. Fleas rodents sister don‚Äôt even talk wants nothing one people.  severely obese coworker covid he‚Äôs fine. sore throat cough didn‚Äôt get much worse that. virus doesn‚Äôt hit everyone same. 70 year old coworker also fully recovered. find real time stats.

the fact matter many many people died without getting tested covid thus deaths attributed directly covid.

Early pandemic Trump spoke clearly less testing lower rate test much.

There doubt mind difference recorded actual death rates attributed part this. 

However forces. Especially hospitals turning people away unless need critical care. Even somebody covid want coming infecting patients waiting room. Unless need immediate care. Hospitals aware source spreading covid tried walk tight line treating many people possible everything could prevent contributing spread.

It always seemed like Trump real moron thought could sweep death rates rug testing. count many people died compare previous years. Even simple subtraction get rough estimate. ~~CDC~~ Trump Administration hasn‚Äôt shown trustworthy regards COVID, he‚Äôs ~~not all~~ stupid. 

FTFY That's constant influx new cases. Germany, example, simply test much virus control. Highest what? Also world black white. improvements perfect. option reduce risk 80% 0%, nothing simply 100% solution.

China going absolute best eradicate virus winter started, keep that. 

But balanced fact winter coming basically place extremely densely populated. 

Which good news all. 

We see happens, would rule new large-scale lockdowns next 6 months. think supply chain would've less disrupted we'd let virus run rampant? people died still many dont care.... America essentially super spreader. reason covid reaches South America quickly.  first months, doctors know blood thinners steroids needed . That's lapdog, lapdogs get put down. China uses entire nation's testing infrastructure surge capacity there's localized hotspots. China national daily testing capacity [4.84 million August using 38,000 testing staff 12,000 testing machines. longest time, goal minimizing loss life. Seroprevalence studies attacked suggesting real impact virus. 

Now actual numbers (not seroprevalence estimates) in.

All sudden, ‚Äúit‚Äôs deaths‚Äù anymore. Anyone else thinks positivity rate biased ?

It occurred people get tested multiple times. would mean positivity rate population underestimated right ? masks, closing bars too. [Maybe head sand. passed March woke bearer bad news, multiple states already use field morgues, idiot's stance ""we can't prevent it, we're going try"", SD either worst one worst per capita right now. someone MA, I'll offer spoiler: going get better own. Yes lethality isn‚Äôt issue. 

But first, right. Lethality vastly increases age. Germany, 0.004% people 34yo succumbed virus (99.996% survival) 22% people ages 75 higher. Even 65-75yo got 2% rate (1:20).

**In total** much worse flu, restricted age groups flu worse you‚Äôre 34 younger comes death. **BUT.**

A huge number people don‚Äôt die shown recovered stats take lasting damage them. Severe damage internal organs like kidney heart, post-viral syndrome insane amounts lasting fatigue, brain fog, loss smell/taste... rarer also occurring lung embolisms, strokes, heart attacks. Appearance autoimmune diseases triggered virus, inability even walk months active infection.

Many viruses cause issues post-infection (thats it‚Äôs called post-viral syndrome) Coronavirus seems much much worse others like flu. make less bullshit claim US bad testing. else news? thoughts matter. Americans like shit others instead good themselves. comment example. I‚Äôm sorry hospitals full. really hope gets care needs needs it. legit stop repeating posted, although believed fake stories heard showed data promised.

However, double conspiracies, mostly ones motivated loyalty president. difference dozen cases thousands case. Learn count. method work places positive percentage high, pooled samples positive

Which yet another reason let things get control allowed get West unless fact intend everyone infected eventually. ""Man dies covid-19 getting hit car."" Lol hospitals payed every person diagnosed covid asked people come back next day raise numbers. buy hype covid scam. True.

Look get it, people think country run differently yada yada whatever. problem I'm sure people still able support someone like Trump this. 

idk, plan leave US anyways, miracle save us. Trump
Is idiot. Fewer expected infections, meaning use larger pooling fewer actual tests.

Basically, really stupid buzzwords conspiracy tropes related Bill Gates such. flu season never came countries either? China aims test nine million residents port city Qingdao within five days following minor outbreak coronavirus, health officials said Monday, first mass testing months. 

The country virus first emerged largely controlled pandemic, cutting stark contrast many parts world still afflicted rolling lockdowns high case numbers.

On Sunday six cases Covid-19 confirmed Qingdao ‚Äì northeastern city 9.4 million ‚Äì originating hospital, Qingdao municipal health commission said statement Monday.

Five districts tested ‚Äúwithin three days‚Äù whole city ‚Äúwithin five days,‚Äù statement said.

China extensive, quick test capabilities health commission said 140,000 employees ‚Äúmedical institutions, newly admitted patients personnel‚Äù already tested Qingdao since cases confirmed.  I‚Äôm funny it‚Äôs prison pontins holiday camp. Well put! surprise. said respond ""You're listening"". Ask part listening to. Also, counted deaths come disadvantaged communities. Guess side vote. oppositions electorate die sometimes part plan. answer point numbers we'll March 2021 be, say, 1 million deaths previous year.

Well, bear mind, I'd never argue future numbers.

However, I'd rather ask would need reported whereby they'd feel compelled rethink conspiracy.

When conspiracy theorist, many years ago, realized awesome ""real truths"" kept reading immune falsification. god damn outcome refit conform conspiracies.

When 10, chose Boniface confirmation name pagans told he'd struck tried chop Thor's tree. went chopped storm found unharmed, converted, built church wood.

Say want pagans, least balls follow religion could falsified. also wonder going effect life expectancy US. already lower many first world nations bet it, disclose it. want actually write next lie get good chuckle it. get normal come pass people. drive rural roads, often west, problem. there's huge uptick deranged people coming freaking. Several last year attempted intimidation, like honking swerving, passing within inches. people rural methhead alcoholic types care decency. Feels methy, maybe warped minds city folk, knows. Rural areas used feel welcoming infections happened China. ward handling imported cases. Haha contacts China very, little anything. Contacts Spain Italy... Yea, maybe. Every single one US articles china's success seems clenched teeth. Every single country managed beat virus used ""authoritarian"" measures similar death rates China, evidence lying there. Behaviors.

We two girls, 4 2, often difficult balance appeasing wife's anxiety providing safe, enriching activities kids. first months pandemic wife would let even walk kids stroller. felt family imprisoned. come long way since then, opened bubble grandparent support childcare. come challenges wife pressures folks change behaviors, would seem safe. wife asks shop person food. mom goes senior hours trader joe's extremely cautious, wipes groceries etc. Still, wife basically forces go shopping person, parents feel need oblige otherwise wife feel comfortable seeing kids. 

But hopeful. said, made lot progress. very, difficult road though. [Lakers fans party outside Staples long time, people brought concerns poverty, bankruptcies, mental health, on, retort ""none things matter, deal later, death final"". idea death thing matters first promulgated advocates stricter lockdowns.

Now turned that, many contexts, COVID's particularly deadly all, people saying, ""deaths thing matter"" - somehow things matter, supposedly, still issues, *including second-order deaths caused lockdowns*. commitment seem actually public health, whatever justify continued restrictions, matters adjusted accordingly. Screw friends stay safe. similar family history, already snagged two autoimmune conditions I'm taking little risk possible.

It's worth it. Exactly. frustrates news death rate numbers dont report issues survivors having. know nurse seeing lots cases people mild Covid laid simple colds due lung liver damage virus caused. flu season going wipe bunch people survived Covid.

Agreed, misinformation cause serious conesquences Dr. Anthony Fauci, nation‚Äôs leading immunologist member White House Coronavirus Task Force, ""some random guy Miami"".

Yeah okay. /s oh FFS, forgot that. 

he truly says much insane/stupid shit, can't keep remember all.  Covid-19 causes pneumonia. person dies pneumonia.

you: ""Covid-19 kill them!"" Pretty sure did. Used year couple months ago stopped working. imagine, look [New Makes sense. One day look back know exactly happened. learn? siree. Lurking message boards? lemons can't anything become keyboard warriors someone like Kevin Hart tweet resurface decade ago. black woman light skinned play role movie. pathetic must be?

Using words even understand, use make look cool leftist jerk buddies, nothing conversation.

What's even worse fake empathy humanity. brought homeless house? given masks food? type fancy words, fake empathy care humanity, make sleep better night? Knowing words gotten 50 plus points Karma 100 likes. God people need fucking die already, hopefully happens soon enough. Jesus Christ you‚Äôre absolutely insane. 

Why subject family that? It‚Äôs basically form torture. Still follow you. started taking notes billionaires coworker got month ago ever since doesn‚Äôt want wear mask anymore. ‚ÄúI already it. It‚Äôs unlikely I‚Äôll get due antibodies.‚Äù

His experience 2 horrid days getting better (the 2 days high fever bad one point lay bed couldn‚Äôt form thought mind). He‚Äôs early 30s, good shape, prior medical conditions.
We also happen work field lot customers elderly. 

It infuriates me. too, there's always going confusion COVID vs. COVID-related deaths everyday conversation. can't assume every death 2019 total COVID related. That's need work like OP better understand happening. No, disinformation narrative. 6% death certificates incomplete listed COVID 19 cause death. effects contracting virus like respiratory failure listed comorbidity. God bless America, arguing troll? course we're talking ""in general"". great great aunt 90+ years got back April fine. frustrated still factually correct: COVID-19 deaths vastly due comorbidity factors. wasn't, explain COVID-19 related deaths average age 80+ years old? think virus ""magically"" targets old people?  Correct I'm wrong Argentina lockdown hard? developed COVID rash, aka urticaria lasted 7 months. case, pig might better animal aphorism. What's misleading it? stated countries focus restrictive measures, also surveillance, COVID-19 testing, tracking community education



When people bringing arguments conveniently leave part saying, agenda.



Mainly want everything reopened 100%. never closed anything, never close anything, ever.


They also forget people think way masks, complain testing, want contact tracing, showing ID enter anywhere contact tracing could work, etc... Americans known plague rats. course can't. complete nonsense find weird people detailed memory incidents prove terrible memory issues Jesus. forgot that. Thanks reminder... sorta. haha Americans. Lots r/conservative cross posting. ""for people"" certainly majority. think two released, family petitioned Trudeau get released. However Trudeau refused conditions release:

Release Meng, China releases 2 Canadians.

I idea Canada insistent keeping Meng America. would even thank Trump ""helping try get Canadians released"" Administration Canada's detention Meng set whole dumb affair. family does. Haven‚Äôt left house since March, receive 2-3 packages day. far good. Good bot. Cuba's money comes ETECSA tourism. got stats? It‚Äôs pure cognitive dissonance. many people, conspiracies much easier accept &amp; explain what‚Äôs going opposed swallowing fact we‚Äôre real, complex, hazardous situation little control. 

In words- they‚Äôre denial. comes conspiracy theories, truth often much boring fiction, yet sometimes harder accept. Absolutely, trust vaccine produced US within next months since it'd clear Trump (and thus political pressure) forced happen. we're talking us halfway vaccine, least close scientists projecting vaccine developed. That's responded first place, since guy scoffed claim 'halfway' vaccine, yet seems like halfway claim far mark. Since testing thing, know covid 2019? Plenty countries locked much harder US ever did, like Belgium, Peru, Spain France, similar worse outcomes. Others, like Vietnam, essentially deaths. Sweden, many Euro countries less US didn‚Äôt lock all. 

There lot interesting post-pandemic revelations, doubt simple lockdown hard equals deaths. Either mother liar are. know mother, so.... legitimately friend texted ""the economy unstable needed nationwide, global economic reset."" Why? it‚Äôs idiots like always doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôll actually get infected 1 cell covid cloth mask month later. know... I'm giving POV people refuse get it. minor ""flu"" symptoms (and context, H1N1 2010 thought going die, sickest I'd ever been) weird thing this, I'm assuming attribute COVID would randomly suddenly winded. fever, malaise, sense ANYTHING wrong all. could anything suddenly, 100% breath like I'd ran mile.

Turns out, that's one insidious symptoms disease...people manifest atypical symptoms disease. Like, little fever, respiratory distress, BOOM can't breathe literally fucking reason all.

But us people wanting others wear masks safe...we're assholes somehow. old coworker iss still ""this bring trump"" excuse. like, ever see hospital footage italy? China? brazil? Literally anywhere isnt uS? ask got back (and US, air land)? know two people came France neither got single call respective 2 weeks. hand, friends drove back NY got calls every day. work guy like that. Back March, paranoid.. visitors building, clean disinfect everything, took seriously. Now? Masks joke, .6% death rate etc etc.. crazy. Oh got you, here's explanation i've heard: ""the extra deaths suicides, drug overdoses, heart problems stress due social distancing job losses"" CMV: it? Thanks! missed somehow. much noise around guess. Incorrect. misunderstanding report, don‚Äôt think you‚Äôve seen many death certificates. 6% references nothing else wrong contracting Covid dying. scary thing.

The 94% died Covid living one co-morbidities, contracted Covid, lead deaths. 

If diabetes I‚Äôm successful managing it, contract Covid die - diabetes alone kill me, make vulnerable Covid contracted did.

In words, would large percentage people still walking around today *with pre-existing conditions*- contracted Covid.

That‚Äôs two sections death certificates cause death. Part 1 indicates ultimately lead death (Covid), several lines specifying chain events lead death (respiratory failure/pneumonia/blood clots).

Part 2 listing significant conditions *contributed* manner death, directly cause manner death listed part 1 (diabetes)

In diabetes example above, would list Covid cause death diabetes significant contributing factor. person die diabetes happen Covid.  many diseases directly caused Covid-19. 

if someone dies pneumonia getting Covid-19, person going magically develop pneumonia absense Covid-19. theory anyways, knows. commonly accepted idea render unable infect using common soaps detergents damage/destroy membrane virus travels.

&amp;#x200B;

If believe washing hand antibacterial agent prevents transmission, also washing mask similar.  There's much misinformation spread social media. would imagine that's part problem. Wow. 434 cases country densely populated 126 million? that's incredible. Tokyo metro alone nearly 40 million, 146 cases!? That's great flip side, Canada say allows Canadians fly US despite border closure

Because Soviet Union. prevent citizens leaving country. No, metric taking account Covid deaths response deaths. 

Imagine small village houses one catches fire. use almost water supply stop fire you‚Äôre afraid it‚Äôs going spread houses. people die thirst. 

This metric taking account fire deaths deaths thirst saying deaths fire. technically accurate, also don‚Äôt know fewer total people would died didn‚Äôt use much water stop fire. Yes, that's completely different analysis. People gonna spend next 40 years arguing could done differently might meant. right now, lot people care knowing actual death toll - assigning blame might fun politically first need know actual cost pandemic face. I‚Äôm pro lockdown. Even Dr Fauci isn‚Äôt pro lockdown. Idk got information discussing virus that‚Äôs killed nearly quarter million people know 10 months. percentage chance death could avoided simple precautions much. Herd immunity lazy dangerous *in world   easy find out, that. live healthcare free finding doctor next impossible without lot effort. nice go hospital needed know wont multi thousand dollar bills pay. real. Imagine 20 year old college student working grocery store making minimum wage 0 health insurance. position cheking masks door. huge dude comes mask, say ""SSir need mask enter"" whips phone, starts screaming iss violation rights, starts throwing shopping carts andpurposely coughs everyone 10 foot radius. police way 10 minutes cause half police force leave covid is. Thats reality town anyway I‚Äôve literally lost friends it. went progressives never really even talked politics going full Fox News rambling communists destitute within next months. can‚Äôt wait realize idiots turned into. borders psychosis. ""Oh shit 0.003% death rate working...lets say even higher!"" believe assholes Oh question mind. I've seen number publications exactly - comparing death rates. New York Times written several articles comparing death rates incredible job data visualizations.

Here's link behind paywall want read article open incognito tab chrome work hospital, confirm COVID related deaths 10th claim are... true numbers probably around 10,000. Yeah, store I've that's good (at least comparison others) costco. Even that's give masks entrance imo creates culture taking seriously within store itself. worry USA everyone 110%. help settle in, move [Covid hotspot state Canada stopping anyone driving Canada.

The US determining gets come US how, Canada. mean certain areas don‚Äôt really help inaccuracies they‚Äôre reporting it‚Äôs surprise people aren‚Äôt believing numbers. example person died ‚Äúthe youngest die COVID‚Äù er multiple times tests died day two later home. negative tests reported cause death COVID. parents didn‚Äôt believe pushed independent autopsy confirmed victim negative virus push push child removed statistic never positive tests all. That‚Äôs people don‚Äôt believe stats, things like that. Okay. thing knuckle draggers constantly forgetting things comparable. 200k deaths preventable coherent plan deal pandemic.

Also. 200,000 deaths. 200,000 deaths *so far*. number going up. We're going hit half million easily year out.

So fuck false equivalences bad stat use. Havr fun trying logical opinion sub...üëå think ‚Äúexcess deaths‚Äù misses cause effect analysis. 

Did COVID cause deaths government response cause deaths? used to. it‚Äôs beyond relevancy. happened bit ago monkey brains lost ability conceptualize numbers big are. 

The numbers grotesque point repeating undersells point taking appropriate precautionary measures handling virus outbreak. 

To put perspective: visually hold image 5 faces people know. mean think 10 people know hold mental image faces. It‚Äôs difficult. Now, picture largest sports stadium you‚Äôve to. It‚Äôs full brim. That‚Äôs average, country, 40,000 people. Now, imagine 7 stadiums. full bustling, living, working, economy stimulating real people. Today, dead. them. one person made out. Every single one felled invisible foe. Oh, CDC today enough cases fill another 6 stadiums. 

Vote. Canada least *kinda* lockdown. people know starting get togethers still way less before.  company trying keep us healthy, conspiration. /s numbing cream put like hour advance something. something ask want take blood. Normally home turn numb doctor's surgery. country lock - thats border control. even locking state level possible - thats Australia done.

Hell, even lock suburbs within cities level makes difference spread disease. Worth wonder many excess deaths collateral damage people avoiding doctors hospitals? area hospitals paramedics aren‚Äôt seeing nearly many heart attack/circulatory issues pandemic. stuff surely didn‚Äôt magically get better, there‚Äôs likely significant number people died die delayed medical care pertaining conditions. Progress made one coffin time. Regardless, don‚Äôt want anyone suffer virus. doctor going tell go hospital anyways.  Thank adopting someone stuck third world shithole. escape route already planned Boundary Waters, would also consider selling ass weren‚Äôt fugly. factor deaths pop clusters people socialize together odds get smaller. Ex whole family 4 dies it. Members immediate family know many people. family dies it‚Äôs much closer 600 knew one 2,400 people knew them. works infected though. NZ's success really upsets you. I‚Äôm BC things relatively control left house socialized select group friends, haven‚Äôt seen anyone outdoors since pandemic began. Haven‚Äôt set foot restaurant (couple patios), haven‚Äôt hugged anyone since began. Practice home. contract tracing we'd able determine peed trump chain Let‚Äôs see. There‚Äôs 13 countries worse 200 better. yes correct sweden didn‚Äôt absolute worst bottom decile ! Lol Oh, apologised. I'm sure relatives allowed get medical care spring happy now.

In case someone unable see obvious:
With rising prevalence, outbreaks care homes become norm again.
There working protection. said back March, data UK, Germany, Spain, France show more. (Citation needed) One highest death rates world litteral senicide murdered old people morphine make hospital stats better.

Yeah truely amazing.

Stop gross defending evil morally corrupt nation. can't read zoom maybe local lockdowns option. would way someone die COVID19 recorded death certificate? I'm sorry loss. I've lost 3 people consistently get ""do know anyone actually affected it"" say 3 people pretty much dismiss go ""well know anyone can't bad"" people losing lives means absolutely fucking nothing them. Saying flu worse masks work makes furious. Larger venues exempt 30 people rule. churches huge allowed fit 30 people. would kinda insane allow 30 people room fits 2000. You‚Äôre trying way hard. first legitimately thought idiot. see you‚Äôre low-effort troll. Cool story, bro. countries better countries far worse employing variety strategies. welcome! Yeah, know hell happening tbh. Everyone knows do, masks enough, home working perfectly doable lot people, news also downplaying anything. seems people sick care anymore. two main things going ability test many people fast fact told wear mask wear mask.

And surveillance system would unacceptable anything remotely resembling democracy. type misinformation referred article. Assume lockdown (‚Äúshutdown‚Äù likely), works. month cases back summer levels. what? Back today‚Äôs level restrictions repeat over? 

You want restrictions sustain. It‚Äôs trivial get zero spread draconian measures it‚Äôs sustainable last resort. Welp literally cited multiple polls substantiating factual basis point. talking about?  It‚Äôs fine long science determines government says way around know that, suspected people wore masks correctly unlike countries. Thank answer. prove everyone ordered stay home? contained eliminated, better now? country almost 1.4 Billion people, I'm sure ever completely go away, accounts eliminated kind mass-spreading rest world seeing. even close 5 percent population. going long winter many cases. Denmark, North Europe, say crime lockdown country month plus start wearing masks general pretend corona country order affect US election, guilty hell!

If work, pretend invaded locusts next time. put plastic locusts everywhere. look great!  Yes, saw that. looking others' opinions, know? fast? Geez Unfortunately looks like people still argue regarding definition 'sick'. symptomatic carrier sick, garage door exit path air, windows side? would put fan there, aimed towards outdoors either way. saw outdoor Rose Garden thing couple weeks ago, virus still linger outdoors spread multiple people. drinking driving rates. expect hand shit free? must Bernie Bro' Something become true want be.
**Exactly.** Sample size 14 people 7.8 million people returned bad news. research happening larger sample. researcher saying need time trend seeing bad news. saying people dieing strokes still researching covid related.


Meanwhile research HAVE, points covid causing strokes. it‚Äôs matter time verifying young people strokes, caused covid, sniffing glue like spare time. Yes, right he's considering NOTHING ELSE, asserted. also saying ""the important issue consider socialization,"" he's saying BE. thing. 

You're taking measured reasonable statement grounds wider discussion distorting order dismiss person saying.

Regardless one views COVID, I'm getting rather tired kind ""I'm going restate point different inaccurate way blow off"" trend culture. Thank reply. successful that, quite smart amazing achievement. Contact tracing easy. I‚Äôm speaking it‚Äôs observable fact lol. really need take break internet. That‚Äôs I‚Äôm here! (Certainly rational viewpoints handle covid Lol) survey done 8 European countries. Greece 1of them. analysis misleading. counting 'non-Covid' deaths, counting deaths directly attributed Covid. people still could died Covid.

And certainly lot societal factors case, paper saying excess deaths correlated Covid. know always tricky go correlation cause-effect relationships, case, takes little human intuition see *the* *pandemic* almost certainly cause. 

It's kinda like could correlate increase non-combat deaths Europe WWII. people die WWII, certainly died *because* WWII headline speak. meant way ""Florida man"", definitely man Florida. Let preface saying think coronavirus hoax. wear mask family isolated since late March. 

I don‚Äôt go Facebook much, hindsight taken screenshot I‚Äôm random person internet. 

In town‚Äôs private page COVID discussion woman claimed nurse nonchalantly admitted something along lines of, ‚Äúyeah, die COVID go ahead say died COVID, that‚Äôs extra funding.‚Äù (Note: there‚Äôs huge wave COVID area anything) private group progressive politically left-leaning (my area solidly blue). don‚Äôt remember seeing replies/reacts her, least nothing memorable. checked fb profile well, don‚Äôt believe troll. couple months ago I‚Äôd heard ‚ÄúCOVID money‚Äù allegations. I‚Äôm guessing there‚Äôs government funding hospitals dealing COVID patients? 

Personally don‚Äôt care one way opinion it. I‚Äôm trying keep vector vulnerable community hope others same.  Covid contagious.  I'm glad speak everybody area. Thousands people took streets last night Lakers NBA finals despite Mayor's office telling people gather. CA, kids still allowed compete youth sports, form 'clubs' traveling neighboring states compete. Bars serve popcorn hot dogs dollar open packed people one enforces guidance here. Underground clubs warehouse parties happen every weekend. Many holding weddings large private residences going 'free' states without limits. Many businesses refused close another lockdown. People sick restrictions shows. People consistently telling pollsters otherwise. Something become true want be. I'm talking absolutely true hospitals coroners get paid extra covid death non-covid death.  vast minority? Okay. take way personal responsibility idiots White House... Cool cool. Hope reading comprehension gets better. sometimes wonder people realize forces involved. vividly remember getting accident 30 mph teenager, taught big lesson. one hurt, cops even bother come, car totaled back sore week anxiety driving awhile that.

It easy forget sitting nice comfy car cruising listening music, wreck even relatively low speeds involves insane forces body meant deal with.

At least one wreck guaranteed would never ever cavalier driving aggressively/taking chances. also noticed height lock down, number people absolutely stupid insane shit skyrocketed. Yawn read article? Point is, can‚Äôt trust number cases March April. all. Anywhere. Sweden‚Äôs case, May numbers either. Sweden got testing going June. I'm saying things happening I'm saying claim ""vast majority"" people things incorrect. 

I live surburbia bible belt USA. see many things mentioned. also know many still taking precautions risky activities mention. Businesses closing popular shopping areas around me. People try ignore reality want, however vaccine % people continue take precautions. Lol. cause death never listed lost job rarely listed overdose alcoholism.

It sounds like watch way many criminal TV shows. cause death heart failure, etc.. Rarely ever dive substance abuse mental health history.

Nobody wants listed. 

I hate sides honest.

The right wing nut jobs act like covid real..

And liberal fucks act like 40 million losing jobs countless spikes mental health substance abuse deaths worth considering opportunity costs. ""Just economy"" murdered Americans Covid. It‚Äôs laughable either case. Well that‚Äôs pragmatic. can‚Äôt let China fix mess?  poster did, mean? applying logic comparison. trust you‚Äôll LOL well. get flu shot year (and every year). (a) don‚Äôt want unnecessary cold/flu symptoms year help it, peace mind, (b) generally try avoid flu, it‚Äôs nasty disease kills lot people, flu spread community often stresses medical resources, (c) definitely don‚Äôt want flu &amp; covid time, reportedly substantially dangerous covid alone. state outbreaks associated schools nursing homes prisons combined. local high school football stadium packed Friday night. article reading test detects type antibody present early infection. antibodies rapidly disappear. test can‚Äôt detect long lasting antibodies, like (a month) infection? Take test (six weeks) would detect nothing? test useful short window two four weeks symptoms start? quality comments daily discussions gotten really low. telling posts comments outside daily thread much better. distancing.

That's new one. right listed table labeled ""Comorbidities"" also using source 94% claim. Seems read ""Cardiac arrest"" sub always circle jerk, you‚Äôre mad it‚Äôs circle anymore üòÇ also last day three, tops. ""protests"" going long now? better cause, yes, excuse morons involved inevitably spreading virus. numbers show NZ suffered economically much peer wealthy nations haven‚Äôt locked harshly. course, there's opposite effect. driver's license expired second week August. state allowed anyone whose driver's license expired 31st July 15th March December renew license. missed less 2 weeks, since 15 years since I've presented DMV, cannot online renewal.

As result, normally maniacal driving become cautious measured. :-) Infections surging bad thing, 1/1000 chance dying 60 PPE valuable regime political wedge issue. numbers clue, need put perspective. It‚Äôs sample size stupid motherfucker. It‚Äôs sample size 14 people. fuck go school learn statistics? researcher said need time research larger sample. Stupid motherfuckers like you, spout complete nonsense walls text, jump hole. people hurt understanding science. It‚Äôs fucking tiny sample, larger population covid patients. Go back fucking school worthless motherfucker. 

TLDR: Really stupid fuck, thinks small sample population 7.8M cases, good thing. Doesn‚Äôt understand jack shit fuck. It‚Äôs actually really bad thing small sample returned results stroke victims zero risks strokes. Incredibly bad. Super Bad.  He‚Äôs American. can‚Äôt think outside narrative. basically normal day LA past however many months? One begins understand Peter great took attitude drag kicking screaming future to. testing. Hospital survival rates improving well. nothing else argue. provide evidence substantiate assertions can't argue assertions basis fact. Hospital furlough false narrative? [google it. made great points far, assertion ‚Äúconspiracy theory‚Äù territory.  least West, media outlets talk except passing, cast doubt safety. blunt reality is, there's geopolitical element play - many government leaders West want see Chinese vaccine succeed (and vice versa - many Chinese govt. officials want Chinese vaccine available solution)

So West, media coverage almost entirely focused western-back vaccine candidates like Pfizer's, Moderna's, etc. came Governor Cuomos mouth, verified states getting money reported Covid death Lol comparing WW2 covid panic... true though. asked question people ""living life"" answered you. want take answer that's fine try bit open minded going forward. 

To use example above, concerned safety get car drive work horrible Houston traffic every day means I'm going drive near speed limit, wear seatbelt, lookout drivers. I'm going stay home fear knowing hundreds thousands drivers killed US alone already year.  1-25 year olds. Show data 1-25 year olds suffering strokes. 

1-25 year olds.

**1-25 year olds.** Well tube, correct choice entry point, ingenuity... Covid virus huge stressor body. Stressors add like burden. Someone might disease long-term health problem 'officially' died from. many cases, Covid exacerbated condition resulted passing.

The point likely acquaintances, co-workers, friends, relatives, know famous people Covid factor death. China shut travel to/from Wuhan 15 cities late January, 3 months first confirmed case human transmission.

Foreign travel ban full lockdown enacted late March early April respectively. suggested people urban areas stay home starting mid February, evidence points general public ignoring suggestion, major commerce continued function normally greater shutdown ordered.

You're right 84k reported cases, honestly make even suspicious. US (well, CDC anyway, largely ignored) began advocating caution first cases began reported late January/early February states shut end February March, end April 1m cases 80k deaths.


At point China actively suppressing reports cases.


Again, China population density 4x greater US. Let's take 300k number infections 10k deaths; early months disease countries heavily affected hospitals swamped respirators short supply; average mortality rate hovering around 8% looking 5 affected countries. suggesting China, virus went completely ignored information virus suppressed 3 months magically less 1/3 cases US 3% mortality rate?


It's likely there's cover-up Chernobyl proportions going here. harass people tell so. travelling internationally right now? Test Positivity Rate 5%, rising hospitalization rate. Seems like always going group people actively try kill others, matter what. Nytimes doom gloom, new. fact took anecdotal 50 people word. evidence researches saying young people dieing isn‚Äôt enough clearly displays bias. even remember last 50 people encountered? Never mind last 50 people know covid? Asinine remarks asinine people. lead researchers telling us, willingly telling us dangers......you sit atop high horse. disdain truth dangerous zealous behavior could ever be. 

If care bring departed family, obviously idiot. argue fight, like zealot, day die morons ignoring information coming scientists researchers. could solace anecdotal evidence actual statements scientists fucking baffling. type lots words, buts it‚Äôs bullshit, hope degree English. listen known troll Correct, likely protected serious complications.

Wear mask, social distance, probably good spot recovered already. widespread March- anything I'd say less prevalent now. 

Fauci gave good interview WaPo Sept. encouraging words- [""we get get back normal lives, guarantee people used phrase every crisis refer changes made daily routines. read much it. annoying hear/read, people, governments, official coming yesterday, know people need lives back. no, clearly don‚Äôt want respond points, it‚Äôs easier live world good guys make bad thing go away everyone tried hard like movies. Would solution drug overdoses everyone stop taking drugs? best use Antibody test learn true regional infection rates, many people get tested. Shut fuck up. won‚Äôt downvote you, certainly understand fatigue disappointment government. American I‚Äôm little jealous nation plan. Stay safe. Sorry, 13.55 million us. (Somewhere around 60x number deaths, around 6x mostly asymptomatic ‚Äúcases‚Äù) Called Reddit like ""nooo muh politics political discourse"" So, willing accept theory aerosol droplets breathing COULD problem 16 hours later ideal conditions, willing accept theory virus could survive surface 28 days ideal conditions.

Sounds like selective acceptance denial research fit preferred world view... korea mass testing? people dying going doctor? Mental health issues end death? Depression due lives turned upside down? 

My family doctor told he‚Äôs seeing 60% less patients. said people disregarding every day health issues. It‚Äôs real issue. shit. stamped passport shooed away. 

Wut? would stamp passport? whole story sounds fake honest, acting like normal stamp passport ""crossed 50 times life"" pretty weird. *200,000 deaths? rookie numbers.* plenty hospital beds available state South Dakota. party ""believes science"" US (or really, anywhere)

Germany disagrees. Chancellor Ph.D Quantum Chemistry knows numbers mean. Test pooling. 

When know minimal cases, put example 100 samples one. tests negative, 100 people deemed negative. 

If tests positive, screen 100 people find needle hay stack

This method work places positive percentage high, pooled samples positive

The number tests truly need run dependant big pools are. done Wuhan slightly lower rate really question goal What's increase maniacs rural roads? Like I'm ever driving alone rural road now... point, car come flying, tailgate me, sometimes pitch fit passing aggressively...

I assume meth

My friend road trip called white truck phenomenon.. often white truck yep concept already established labs postivity rate low what's unbelievable ridiculously low testing isn‚Äôt right. ‚òπÔ∏è hope find better job! Qingdao dense city, chances 12 low. makes matters worse fact many people travel back forth Qingdao Shanghai often (flight hour). know much travel going Qingdao South Korea, pre-pandemic popular route also hour flight. 

It see outbreak Shanghai, could bet things going get control fast, past months people started become lax know that's working everywhere else.

The two main things going ability test many people fast fact told wear mask wear mask. tell guys would happen bunch people without masks (or even masks) started anti mask protest. getting colder out.... Well, would useful test whether vaccine confer sterilising immunity, tough test normal phase 3 study NUMBER 1!!!!!! real next lesson keep borders permanently closed country repeatedly hides outbreaks people world allowing international travel. could clicked link referenced source bottom. 

The table provide 14 patients evidently clear. Along statement researcher himself, appears need larger sample size confirm younger younger age groups. link, coupled evidence supporting hypothesis strokes young people since similar studies conducted brain fog Hypertension. isn‚Äôt young people aren‚Äôt strokes, totally fucking are. It‚Äôs researchers need verify strokes happening due Covid. see trend hypothesis since strokes normally high time year. 

I don‚Äôt really see point whatsoever, researches saying need time research. also saying data telling bad story seen professionals, young people strokes. process getting people study isn‚Äôt exactly speedy.....all evidence points young people strokes caused covid.

Wish could take screenshot Jabbour‚Äôs statement table. Would much easier say evidence showing people strokes. trying verify strokes caused covid. Jacinda Boris. questions? 38 fucking percent!!!! Don‚Äôt worry SD gov won‚Äôt interfere quest herd immunity. Oh stupid insta-famous idiot. Thank fuck Moncton police ridding us problem. Anyone access this? Paywall point article? nonsensical speculation hear republican house ‚Äúthe numbers skewed. log every death hospital corona. death toll isn‚Äôt high make seem.‚Äù i‚Äôm it. Fuck people, run sarcasm truest form. believe combat loss nuance public discourse dropping even nuance it. Someone told me, ""people can't hear tone writing in"". could think ""well, did"" Thank comment. provide great imaginative fuel least remainder day. People like hearing inconvenient truths. go far say know young-ish people see another pandemic lifetimes, however pandemic/infectious disease specialists warning years years exploding population, increasing interaction humans wildlife lead zoonotic viruses. fact, last couple decades humans got lucky. H1N1 pandemic fortunate mild virulence. MERS, SARS spread control. H5N1 (bird flu) stopped pathogenic enough cause pandemic. Ebola stopped, mechanisms favor easy transmission. Hell, even lucky COVID. could lot worse even 1-2x deadlier.  claims Chinese none Chinese vaccinated travelled abroad got COVID. Yes, intelligent people want know answers.

Unfortunately, idiots refuse understand Covid causes conditions cause death, doesn‚Äôt mean Covid wasn‚Äôt cause death. Exactly, everyone that's vulnerable gets paid leave stay home hang pandemic over. Perfect logic there. made point me.  Oh well, state race-equity based reopening, means never reopen anyway. incomplete make sense. During? elaborate? go implicitly trusting anything Chinese say regards COVID. Overdose listed thr cause death find someone dead needle arm. Generally Rarely deaths stimulants, alcohol, ot sleeping pills listed overdose.

Bull...shit. literally job medical examiner find cause death unexplained death. Toxicology screening routine unexplained car crashes alcohol drugs would up... Clients die car crashes rarely get tested drugs/alcohol system...

Again, bull...shit. Around 30% crash victims tested drugs. suspected, tested for. also recorded FARS database. complete failure recognize significant collateral damage covid response... Whether advocate responses.. Sickens me.

Because collateral damage terms numbers deaths small. weren't, states highest numbers frequency excess deaths attributed COVID would states restrictive lockdowns. aren't. states lesser lockdown measures reopened quickly. sickens see people needlessly died way look numbers would look covid deaths versus increase deaths causes response deaths.

As authors point discussion study, many excess deaths attributed COVID-19 could indeed COVID-19 deaths recorded such. could lack testing simply due prioritizing comorbidities assigning death. family member die unrelated covid see covid....what think that?

You‚Äôve latched onto word ‚Äúyounger‚Äù, study makes clear it‚Äôs context traditional stroke victims, younger people teens 20s. put frankly, one guilty believing facts coming scientists researchers. claiming many people 25 younger suffering strokes, conclusion you‚Äôve come own.

And said before, that‚Äôs issue.

Not buying love every article mentions bad US COVID response without saying actually wrong specific policies would enact fix think wrong.

It's also really hard take stuff like running ‚Äúworst testing system‚Äù country

when countries like Argentina 60% positive rates _no_ testing. US done tests anyone else people still criticize it... Hint: dead dumb piece shit.  this, go hide bunker never get sick along anyone else wants lockdown forever rest us move vaccine comes.

Wanting live life deplorable vaccine here.  biggest newspaper declared Tegnell Sweden's guide Galaxy late March they've let easy mistakes failed predictions since then. critical questions press conferences usually asked foreign journalists.

If really think Sweden functional critical press, simply understand bad really is.

Group think big thing Sweden ""√Ösiktskorridoren"" real. Maybe meant NZ things rigorously. know case is. Public: ""Christmas shopping, YAYYYY!"" pretty solid chance friend knows nothing world outside town. seem audience anymore. experience well. friend panic attack NBA cancelled season. hardcore anti-masker covid denier.

I give fuck releases not. never even asked them. explaining possible since seems confused he‚Äôs respectful decent human being.

Nah dude lol. Decent respectful human beings dont take bunch photos bad accident get printed keep home. Decent respectful people photograph all. definitely go online bragging photos mangled corpses cars. travel bans. Quarantines. Travel bans bad policy, liable motivated political expediency science. also encourage countries downplay potential epidemics avoid economic consequences targeted ban, leading worse results overall.

Quarantines also FAR effective. travel ban total complete, eventually infected individuals slip through. quarantine enacted, individuals instantly mingle native population rapidly spread virus. travel ban targeted foreign nationals may miss mark expat returns spreads virus, foreign national another country enters. quarantine international travel catches infected individuals matter circumstance. 

As far timing goes, clear early alarm bells rang January February. declared global health emergency January 30th. took 44 days US implemented serious measure virus.

Compare SARS, alert went March 12, 2003 US travel advisory three days quarantine 15. Similar expediency happened ebola epidemic enhanced screening occurred within days US transmission man 2 nurses. H1N1, US new test within 3 days warning community recommendations 6. 

The coronavirus epidemic exception US's usual response. countries best, Taiwan, implemented testing far earlier date. Taiwan quarantines travel advisories even announcement, starting Jan. 20. Australia also screening around time, started quarantining day announcement.  No, actually would not. long taking good care citizens trying best control understand virus. would support that. Uhhh lives lost? We're allowed value lives.

Masks even effective, per study SFU.
They're step security theatre thats Well expect do? Despite best efforts, half US restrictions (well, certainly enforceable ones) anymore. would argue (as would many experts) outdoor gatherings seem safer things like working office buildings riding public transportation, use anyway people even bare minimum?

What going anyway? Wag fingers aggressively? country given even trying basic things. health officials LA urged people get wasted home instead outside 30,000 people, that's do. Whoever started flu comparison (we know :) dumbass.

It‚Äôs like 0.1% magic number, anything acceptable, ‚Äúunacceptable‚Äù.

It‚Äôs spectrum.

People want open everything 100% people think deaths show failure system (how convenient, given political debate) extremes spectrum, literal ‚Äúextremists‚Äù

A reasonable approach looks pandemics tragedies need deal best can, things ignore ‚Äúwait out‚Äù. girl high school class one year died Crohn‚Äôs, I‚Äôm pretty sure knowing family good medical care along. early 30‚Äôs engaged. passed away hospital &amp; time mom did. nurses. it‚Äôs bad enough case Crohn‚Äôs, kill. former coworker it-she finally lot intestine removed 2 different surgeries much better. able work full time &amp; sing lead vocals band. long struggle her, decent insurance whole way. I‚Äôve fly several times different airlines last months. 

Today fly Frontier, I‚Äôd advise anyone using airline. Every airline I‚Äôve used (Delta, JetBlue, American, etc) left seats open, enforced social distancing masks worn properly. 

Frontier temperature check gate, flight sold capacity. bunch people weren‚Äôt wearing masks right way. social distancing. 

I didn‚Äôt realize full flight already plane seat. whole experience ridiculous unnecessarily risky. Celsius Fahrenheit? Might also add, within 200 person ‚Äúbubble‚Äù enclosed spaces face covering. sure compares countries seems like madness! literally hear exact opposite every single republican know... that's wrap folks. hardly mild though. death toll 5x-6x flu that's conservative estimate. really mild. 

Also, liberty ends start harming me. play whatever music want. can't play full blast 2 am. bunch people start running around masks, distancing restrictions put everyone else risk. Europe managed get stats low enough one point, big surge they‚Äôre seeing legitimately seen second wave.

The US never got virus subdued low enough except pockets (NYC) state there. 

So surge seeing dozen states wave really moved Northeast last spring Sunbelt summer Midwest rising Northeast again, West Coast rising ebbing throughout. 

Experts predict get worse weather northern states gets colder people congregate indoors. know independent means?

Comorbidity indicate either condition existing simultaneously, **independently** another condition related medical condition.  Gonna miss like heart attack. South Korea? impossible elected officials actually care try. Didn‚Äôt Trump Administration pandemic plan previous Administration? Oh, wait. threw away.  said, ""by metric"". mentioned one metric, didnt define it. even wrote ""To start with"".

Why rude unable give counter arguments? agricultural products type goods poorer people rely on? 

When comes starving, poorer ones, much.

You realize lockdown allows quicker recovery, right? China, New Zealand, Finland Norway largely recovered Sweden's initial surge less check mobility data.

[Details country gathered Info Norden found here. result, change visits workplaces decreased 26% Sweden, 39% Denmark, 41% Norway 47% work places. Schools public facilities closed countries went lockdown, would make difference **far more** significant. even getting data support cities ghost towns peak, seem believe business usual.

Who said that? I'm aware measures taken Sweden, idea strict ones taken Finland Norway blatantly Nordic counties quite soft lockdowns

This false narrative pushed would otherwise contradict argument. Refer list multiple countries hit much harder responded lockdowns without sacrificing much economy. Germany US good examples.

Germany, long time rising numbers positive tests rates positive rate stayed same, thus knew dangerous development testing. find infections amount testing, that's see danger.

You honestly don‚Äôt thing media drumming fear? Seriously? Yes, they‚Äôre 70 already deaths door. üòÇ I‚Äôm freaking little maybe I‚Äôm trying seek solace asking, goes:

I met friend past Tuesday around 12 midnight, together well next day, (Wednesday, October 7, noon). 

The next day, mother, lives, got fever, persisted right now. Add that, shivering headaches too. 

No one else family, friend included, showed symptoms now, Rapid Test done mother said result negative. (I‚Äôm worried cases false negatives rapid testing usually yields). doctors asked get normal test (PCR) done too, since symptoms still here. 

It‚Äôs 5 days since meeting (not counting Tuesday) I‚Äôve living family normally (without isolating them, isolating world). 

Do know do? family kind depends this, I‚Äôm worried don‚Äôt know do. one country can't close borders strict rules harsh penalties travelers country. 

Has someone done proper cost benefit analysis elimination, versus living virus effective vaccine (which may never). takes 2 5 years develop vaccine never vaccine corona virus before. mandatory, forced, rushed vaccine harm good.  
The costs elimination 76 days lost economic activity. conservative assumption lot economy knowledge based time total loss economy. Many work home, rest recover, learn new skill improve current skills country re-opens, ready contribute economy even elimination lock down. even 76 days complete total loss economy, full economic activity back, full elimination 76 days still best option. Look year, look 2 years. 
Over 1 years 76 days almost activity vs. 289 days full, complete economic activity, full restoration businesses airlines sports events, coronavirus.
versus
365 days reduced economic activity, huge strain health system, small businesses failing, entire industries like airlines life support etc.. I‚Äôve seen claimed nose breathing (in out) benefit nitric oxide generated sinus tissue anti-viral also sounds kind bullshitty me. Lol yea course. make boss. grandmother law died nursing home...a week two workers tested positive. autopsy fairly healthy that. don‚Äôt believe numbers minute. one stopping job one saying everything needs completely shut down. unreasonable things like require masks distancing public encourage people stay home can. Trusting people evaluate risks kind stupid given things gone far. People pretty piss poor risk evaluation. No, cant possibley back claim. Even hoax would still explain unites states 200K deaths usual. may need convert xls csv use data, though. medical evidence says spread minimal outdoor spaces entirely possible OP's friend pretty sure exposed  grasping straws trying deflect. read article, huh? one pool mansion nyc don‚Äôt think first world nations throw Muslims concentration camps, throw doctors windows tried caution world regarding severity pandemic. you. proper lockdown Australia started beginning August. Time wasted ""half-ass"" partial lockdown like rest world including Europe. Partial, shutdown measures ""flatten curve"" eradicate anything prolong pain. takes two half months 76 days strict, proper lock eliminate disease. virus eliminated mid October. dozen cases whole country per day deaths 3 days row, right schedule. Australia eliminated community spread pending results one minor outbreak, deal imported cases make sure travel quarantining testing point. I'm saying that. No. I‚Äôm asking question statistics. Ya know...science? Sweden would like word. cap saying death toll Norway 1100% higher reported.

I can't take seriously. Lockdowns nothing slow inevitable. vaccine go away. can't lock everyone months. one safe Corona pandemic over. everyone reddit American. least choose stay home. China locked people in. Call liberty then. Weak comparison. lot engineering, money regulations put improving safety mitigating fatalities automobiles. drink general. Even driving, allways conceal carrying. nah mostly thinning stupid, fat, sick ones. cruel natural way, old. people like admit, pretty natural, unlike 1919 Spanish flu killed young healthy. never added component providing free charge place people quarantine ( systemic way, trial projects &amp; homeless). needed commandeer armories, recently closed hospitals, closed military bases, whatever could places homeless people anyone tested positive quarantined. Food &amp; medical care provided, get negative 2 weeks. People go home &amp; try isolate within homes like Chris Cuomo basement &amp; wound giving family members &amp; roommates. Homeless try manage streets fewer places open get food fewer people around beg money from. Medical workers could afford stayed motels protect families medical workers well-paid &amp; could afford that. 
, Meh, Ischgl, would've somewhere else. practically preventative measures place Europe time, spread would've happened regardless.  Lol rathole. Anyway, yes please share updates. far media watching like hawk teacher make martyr hasn‚Äôt happened yet. fact fatality rate basically decreased factor 4? we're months vaccine despite rising cases positivity rate holding relatively steady, meaning we've gotten better scaling testing? making claim cant possibly backup, since know exact ways deaths counted differently countries. even done yet.. don't. study touches depression passing. almost 300,000 deaths?

We're already depression, dude lead horse Pandemic Response Team, can't stop disbanding it. wish people cared one another get numbers down. see people wearing masks. dont know one person doesnt close family high risk Nobody understands it, even smart people frustrating look what‚Äôs happened tourism industry Caribbean, example, Pacific people aren‚Äôt taking holidays,‚Äù said.  what‚Äôs happened smallholder farmers world. ‚Ä¶ Look what‚Äôs happening poverty levels. seems may well doubling world poverty next year. may well least doubling child malnutrition.‚Äù

Please actually read article responding. talking 3rd world countries. news, water wet.

We ""hold hands ears"" stage evolution America. 

Wait till hit million. Maybe maskholes start paying attention. study accounts that. lot media coverage too. It‚Äôs like scientific consensus swings daily random studies everything presented clickbait fashion ‚ÄúNow excuse vote sexual assaulting reality tv show host president‚Äù mean like vaccine rushed political reasons, chance? Wish knew happening. Seems die sometimes left debilitating long term (hasn't long enough say permanent) effects. ""It means society well bunch cows would.""

Put threat like pack wolves next herd cows, I'd bet cows would try move away safety. collectively dumber herd cows comes Covid-19.  You‚Äôre saying China never first wave outbreak? get wrong. China blame happening US. completely fault US variety ways. little significance patient zero came point.

I think colossally full shit lying numbers save face. Nice, work paywalls? Governments borrowing money causes inflation bankruptcy. It‚Äôs like pay back. takes lot time. massive economic depression would result would strain average American decades. It‚Äôs worth it.

Also idea government would even put dent military spending hilarious. 

This reality. it‚Äôs simple telling people fill businesses half capacity grandma. There‚Äôs lot think people need get used idea. Nabarro said lockdowns justified ""to buy time reorganize, regroup, rebalance resources, protect health workers exhausted. **But large, we‚Äôd rather it.**‚Äù

I understand goes narrative, smart scientists devoted lives studying societal implications pandemics. beg you, listen science. one read here? headline misleading. speaking non-Covid deaths ‚Äúindirectly caused Covid.‚Äù Like died haven‚Äôt gone hospital fear getting virus, someone may died due losing health insurance unemployed due lockdown caused virus. 

While certainly terrible, acting like ‚ÄúCovid caused those‚Äù heck stretch. easily linked mental illness. point found odd people worry changing underwear every day, mask rubs face open mouth.

Then said knew whole lot things would sit on, would press lips breath through. Poop doesn‚Äôt come face. Maybe you? same. moderate dysautonomia; neurologist exactly sure cause. curiosity, ever get nerve biopsy done? ""hole punch biopsy"" done leg two different places found significant nerve damage + damage sweat glands. Neuro made diagnosis dysautonomia caused small fiber neuropathy. SFN standalone diagnosis though, symptom. epi/norepi levels place along heart rate, pattern consistent POTS. Yea course down. disparity WAY compared normal, like said could covid related, ‚Äúcovid induced‚Äù. Still result imo, like people ending homeless job losses due covid. hero need hero deserve probably death still off. thinking different ‚Äúhummer‚Äù started comment. Governments borrow money time. Borrow money pay stimulus pandemic over. Pay taxing wealthy, corporations, ending military spending. response always be, ""Ok, think killing rest people?"" religions this, it‚Äôs people follow

Edit: mean kind everyone too, swear anything show prove right flat refuse believe. friend mine trying convince CDC lying us months now. Right. Trump Cultists talk one really dying Covid. protecting others work fine. 

This kind shit hate seeing.

Yeah, wash masks, used get chance wash mean may well wear it. Okay. No. actually math ago. pull HALF military budget (which would never happen) that‚Äôs one check every American citizen one thousand, five hundred dollars. One. ( accounting families). 

The corporations filter money government via taxes. agree, tax more. collection money would take time. maybe year could sustain population couple weeks. can‚Äôt rob upfront. 

So no, money isn‚Äôt there. reference America‚Äôs wealth, aren‚Äôt referencing governments wealth. They‚Äôre referencing Elon Musks country contractual obligation help us.  I‚Äôm this. isn‚Äôt anyone pulling excess deaths statistic? It‚Äôs one best tools tracking virus Yeah.  Fuck ‚Äòem. We‚Äôre tried, laughed us, tried harder, laughed harder. Fuck ‚Äôem. problem anymore.  Aren‚Äôt one saying saying wiping butt? comment removed? that, bulk force behind droplets diverted difused. droplets may blocked, travel fraction distance. father like that, too. Swears every hospital gets paid $43K per person put ventilator. longer reasonable conversations man without going far right tangent. China welded people inside homes. Maybe die worlds collective IQ raise. states fudging numbers pneumonia deaths otherwise, I'm surprised US actually among top testing world. ranks 20th almost small population countries islands less 10mil people. USA trailing UK beating every large countries terms testing (Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Australia, Canada)..     
     

Sort Tests/1M pop - There's literally president he's obviously struggling breathe public downplaying virus there's people thinking hoax, scientist doctors experts world trying help turn around say thousands people group chat make hoax can't go dine McDonald's, world get you, fucking save stop trying kill everyone else negligence   get high results due low testing. people celebrate one doctor supposedly leaked pandemic Wuhan. believe doctor, proves CCP tight control news going China, means absence news chaotic widespread infection recent months proves China actually contain virus. read actually said, talking 3rd world countries, **primary** measure. countries measures, like US. left spread control. Yes did, realized get could maybe store would needed it.

You believe recession run bank see everyone else line. even experience. wife's ex-husband's current wife (read slower it'll make sense lol) ""it bad"" &amp; ""everyone catch get with"" . mother-in-law *who cares 86 year old mother* swings either extreme. her, wants either everybody stay home let's go lick every doorknob town get with. her. school teacher btw. get wanting normalcy, can't go daily life *and* take precautions? CDC said that. That's fact 6% deaths actually Covid-19.

Should people believe CDC? Great counter points. 

No, it‚Äôs disingenuous article tries make jump racial income related issue based data evaluated. It‚Äôs hitting counties worse yes, it‚Äôs also disproportionately impacting cities higher population density. 

They literally looked excess deaths county made conclusion urban counties higher rate excess deaths. shouldn‚Äôt surprising anyone following disease appears spread. subtitled article make sound disadvantaged contributing factor. 

To clear bipoc person, it‚Äôs don‚Äôt think poor minority communities impacted higher rate, isn‚Äôt good dataset evaluate specific statement. It‚Äôs happening everywhere except Australia, New Zealand south east Asia. 

Europe resurgence. absolutely. Can‚Äôt tell difference Trump Wait, rub underwear face?

I think miscommunication... add another . .com circumvent paywall Kinda point also, BS rampant maybe coincidence. Still, sort drive home point washed frequently already. I'm guilty leaving mine unwashed weeks time largely think dirty smells. trying get better it. Hey, Buddy. you‚Äôd wear mask doesn‚Äôt spew droplets everywhere coming here, that‚Äôd Great... wonder Brain Fog Trump......hopefully people letting make decisions. ""They found 249,167 total excess deaths 1,021 counties, 183,686 deaths directly assigned COVID-19 death certificates, another 65,481 excess deaths officially assigned COVID-19. means 26 percent excess deaths directly attributed COVID-19‚Äîor viewed another way, actual excess deaths 36 percent higher number officially attributed COVID-19."" Didn‚Äôt came saying lockdowns option last resort?  mean logically ask would rather put cloth face wiped mouth cloth face wiped butt, really isn‚Äôt question me. take don‚Äôt surviving parents? siblings physical impairments? ‚Äúrun it‚Äôs course‚Äù say, it‚Äôs likely die. death could avoided holding vaccine arrives. much off. travel ban china nothing prevent 200k+ deaths. chinese new year, travel ban enacted?

I literally watched everyday March April trump kick scream deny every recommended scientific preventive measure. day, going public see 20% mask usage despite governor mandates.

If trump way, would done absolutely nothing save single life, impression would infect democrats. fact rest incompetent administration contracted virus proof itself.

What needs happen supporters take step back actually evaluate situation clear, unbiased scientific information, maybe realize harrasing him, holding president standards american ideals, defending incompetent president history country absolutely nothing back claims up.

The president rascist, clings ""china virus"" derogatory term virus nothing chinese. likely come country. Open history book read past pandemics, origins, outcomes. search looming crisis climate change potential pandemics. Yeah 1000 per day holding. They're mink market virus ground zero, ;) Stupidity, ignorance selfishness killing people. Dear February 2020. recall taught already. news October? Sad. Hope went better place. know that, plenty places contained temporarily, come right back anyway, like Central Europe. It‚Äôs still way soon say South Korea, even vaccine hopefully soon. 

You‚Äôve ignored every part argument probably unsustainable, anyway ‚Äúbasic‚Äù without massive sacrifices elsewhere, applicable situation faced right 95% counties world.  ‚ÄúAlternative facts‚Äù aren‚Äôt facts they‚Äôre politically expedient way it‚Äôs low really intentionally weaponize took crazy extreme measures knew to. you‚Äôd also believe they‚Äôd even care killed 2% people Right? Literally everyone area wears mask required. know ""but one actually it"" narrative started yet kids still school enrollment trending downwards game Thankskilling year, guarantee it! Ebola cases US: 13
Ebola deaths US: 2

Covid cases US: 7.9 million
Covid deaths US: 219,000 (reported) 299,000 (36 percent higher)

So basically, covid kills ton people precisely it‚Äôs lethal things like ebola bubonic plague. Modern health care medicine contain plague easily, can‚Äôt contain stupid. This, exactly. 

I'm getting little tired people acting like choice closing businesses business usual. never choice.  280,000 libtards killed make Trump look bad! thinking decrease procedures due fact every hospital stopped elective procedures. One also note jobs left US workforce, go overseas. shifted domestic slave labor. Everyone knows sharks leading cause death America. entire week devoted raising awareness. Covid mink coat? Maybe controversial thinking work directly contribute costs accomodating, feeding operational expenses prisoners? 95% people reuse mask without washing. yet meet anyone actually washes theirs. money come military budget? money come massive tax cuts corporations wealthy? don‚Äôt nationwide mask mandate already? recall reading proven cases mink giving covid19 humans risk anyone works around them

I know company working vaccine cats caught humans concern could give humans. far documented cases. similar Chinese numbers outbreaks came it, I, many people far better credentials field have, think China undercounting significantly countries, around 40-50%. cheated faked numbers look like outbreak somewhere else first ones hit, would really weird coincidence match countries spread rate well. continue wash them. Doesn‚Äôt take long probably avoid sickness well. open everything, consumers aren‚Äôt going go think product (I.e. airplanes, bars, hotels, restaurants) get sick.

Air travel went 95% despite actually shut Also, people hard time taking gradual danger seriously e.g. climate change opposed immediate threat. less 10 instances that, almost cases alternate exits apartment building welded. like half Rose Garden massacre. Coronavirus like. 

Nom Nom Nom Nom Nom :D 

I like stomach like liver human lungs please deliver!! think nephew wear one he's afraid make look like democrat. Maybe live. live rules leave house going essential job, getting groceries caring risk family member. Plenty people dying homes getting diagnosed die. Slowing infection needs done combination factors: social distancing, testing, masks, fear, vaccine, bit herd immunity. 20% population resistance tip scales. 

I absolutely advocating herd immunity government‚Äôs strategy, effects already noticeable hard hit communities. get pneumonia COVID though? Misinformation, disinformation, information put properly context final villains US. Propagated social media simpletons take everything surface level. Mink Oil still popular product US. US farmers raising profiting industry. can't blame entirely China matter hard try. isn‚Äôt anyone pulling excess deaths statistic? It‚Äôs one best tools tracking virus

Seriously. issue demand explain numbers come in. Screw that! incumbent explain why, 7 years Death stats new jersey, suddenly skyrocketed month deaths normally fall, following months breaking prior records month.

Even data posted source, still brainwashed conspiracy-loving relatives telling massive jump, far exceeding past deaths past jumps, prove anything. disingenuous. also providing information value blindly hurling insults.

They said thing man died motorcycle accident ""We know Covid-19 caused obese, 75, bad heart die Covid-19. died old, fat, exercise. Likewise. Even conservative factions family, thankfully, feel same. definitely headlines almost exactly floating around fb earlier today. True, true. think need people calling people shitty takes. might make think twice spreading misinformation. Way valuable way spend time spent writing garbage comment. visit then? Go home difficult situation sucks go that. Hope ok. stating something confidently, able link specific page also quote portion page said it. CDC ton different pages covid, can't expect people go trawling verify something stating fact. Lethality rate combined spread high - lethality rate something like 1% (which like 10x Flu). Also keep mind - that‚Äôs 1% extreme measures (shutdowns, social distancing, cleaning, mask useable). Imagine would without that. 

Also - 1% USA population 3 million. Anytime someone says ‚Äúit‚Äôs 1%!!!!‚Äù - bring figure. Yeah apparently get paid COVID death regular one. asked is, know... hospital. worldwide effort. farthest along project run Oxford university UK. ‚ÄúThe point CDC trying make certain percentage nothing else COVID. mean someone hypertension diabetes dies COVID didn‚Äôt die COVID-19 ‚Äî did.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo, numbers you‚Äôve hearing, 180,000 plus deaths real deaths COVID-19. Let confusion that,‚Äù Fauci said.

Read here: experienced personally (not covid related) back 2018 scary. makes think neuronal pathways involving GABA implicated. expert, allow share personal experience.

In 2018 unexplained insomnia, started seeing new GP. old, went med school 1950s. Anyway, eventually put 10mg diazepam per day sleep, trying trazadone ambien. turns use diazepam two weeks max, even prescribed sleep issues medicine today.

So winter, vacationed Canada friends. stopped taking cold turkey thought sleep issue gone. taking 8weeks. insomnia rebounded like crazy, got classic tranquilizer withdrawal symptoms. six days sleep all, funny thing never felt sleepy either.

Long story short, Christmas eve, ringing one ears, next thing know that's hear ear. Luckily, hearing came back gradually span 24hours, Christmas evening 90% back. day, still bit hearing loss, bad tinnitus comes nowhere.

But much luckier lady, amount loss imperceptible outside hearing test. happens you, need go ER right away, start steroid meds limit damage.

Again, keep mind lady, hearing loss instant immediate. scary hell. happened me, barely even 30yrs old. Since then, I've avoided gabaergic medications, including alcohol. prescribed gabapentin PRN muscle tensions, doc told me, actually gabaergic - instead modulates calcium channels.

E: med source: appears total loss permanent lady. need go doctor ER within 24 hours happening start steroid therapy. Even then, prognosis highly variable. lucky - virus-related me, GABA system complete haywire. 

A happened anywhere else, expect happen one lowest populated states? political affiliation? 
That's lockdowns extremely restrictive. huge fall short period allows faster growth restrictions eased. mean economy worse overall. 

The present numbers future forecasts reflect this: business survey rated NZ number one covid response, country business executives feel confident invest in.

Also, many people die, really good economy too.   news like people always conveniently leave churches holding services several hundred people (the ones I've seen anyway) massive: 2000 seats. That's comparable sometimes many people fit concert halls theaters. theaters concert halls gotten special permission admit 30 people allowed national guidelines. places venue 600 seats would get permission. church mentioned article 2500 seats. That's 5 seats per person attended, ratio even higher people:seats number theaters. People churches abiding similar rules people theaters keeping distance. They're densely packed crowd. people loose shit churches spreading 400 people giant hall 2500 would fit really getting equally upset dispensations cultural sector. see tons news articles, opinions outrage that. would lot interesting wasn‚Äôt incredibly dangerous harmful. choose listen. I‚Äôm thinking person said bashing heads walls something cases spring. Testing old sick. we're testing younger. taking time spread go younger older. wait. website. think we'd need wait years comparing death rates? info already available. many actually then? Source? relevant schools. wipe everything every class, spots get missed. 7 classes per day room, 28 days, even sanitation ü•∫ Cue f'ing shi'at memes.  mental gymnastics lol, literally said! please use civility. never worked government, take No. comorbidities, even slight risk deadly. Probability becomes moot point. We're almost halfway vaccine, trip wait. tell us like work White House. Yeah, think right. seems difficult. GTA? Yes, know fair number people left houses probably less five times past seven months, hugged anyone, socially interacted. 

I went five months leaving property all, didn‚Äôt see anyone beyond people live with, however live large family rural property, get along fantastic, large amount pandemic privilege. person dies pneumonia died pneumonia Covid. Labeling death like Covid incorrectly inflated numbers.

You incorrect saying speaking misinformation.

Read CDC doc. someone actually read data released trials far, plan taking first day can. provide link stated this? people say go away November 3rd special kind stupid. Like, almost brain dead. guess Pence front end caravan got much fluid eye. dude gone dark side administration four years. Must feel like 40. living got covid tho. Get here. type idiot work I‚Äôm gonna slap shit way out. sure getting voted. like said two mutually exclusive. true folks.

I extra long lock due non-covid medical issues. 7 months home number me. Panic attacks, brain fog, whole works. Back therapy first time 10 years. say first hand absolutely correct.

Have karma back. idea 90% deaths, people diseases contributed demise much moreso Covid-19. 

So long relatively healthy safe. 

As morbidly obese conservatives healthy. know hypertension is? Man, quite mental gymnast, aren‚Äôt you?

The advising countries - third world ones - lockdown. don‚Äôt understand? know disagree think people side this. official count:

* 37,395,029 global infections
* 1,075,750 global deaths

= 2.9%

But extrapolate WHO's 0.6%, assuming deaths correct number (they can't lower), global infection number 179,291,667 1 50 people (wordwide). Oh, I've done lot backpacking adventure racing, even know gross dirty... WHO's predetermined plan. investigation supposed happen pandemic over. That's another fact. It‚Äôs probably labeled somewhere virus highly doubt put covid cause death fact died car accident. conspiracy ass bullshit.  March told need take actions keep hospitals capacity. that. Hospitals astonishingly empty. want life back. reasonable chain events US get shit together 4 months. That's third year! nation, effectively able travel international third year. one blame broken ass government point.

I'm happy federal certain state responses think single nation issue human nature issue. cautious July said fuck nonsense. I'm completely wreckless always wear mask, wash/sanatize hands, wear gloves whenever handle anything people could touched friends invite go eat I'll go, longer shop every 2 weeks needed even grab 1 2 things, tried go back normal routine possible. Without vaccine best live normal life, avoid enclosed crowded spaces, dodge older overweight people like Neo matrix accidentally pass covid them. 108 countries also plot, too. giant conspiracy PRC. People afraid PRC's rise sole super power world.

/s Ebola particular easy contain developed country spreads bodily fluids. 

The reason problem largely Africa, especially rural Africa, lacking clean water systems lower hygiene standards allow disease spread. groups death traditions involve close contact bodies also led problems regions. one recent outbreaks government West Africa actually soldiers forcefully removing bodies villages try curb spread Ebola. People saw videos old white lady screaming Costco employee wanting put mask assumed situation must apply 99% people, guess. Find one. Set free. could Covid....They tested negative. False negative? Guess Ill never know sure.... still proper investigation almost year out.

That's fact. Try working co-parenting one idiots. literally cannot get away stupidity germs. non-sensical rhetoric.   wife wear mask work day everyday. 5 masks, washes weekly. successful vaccine would one could bring herd immunity. 50% effective would need high rates vaccination opening border. could likely open countries low infection rates rely contact tracing stop small outbreaks NZ, knowing virus would struggle spread exponentially. better vaccines appear vaccination rate overseas improves could open countries. No, not, sheep. person dies pneumonia that's direct result COVID, pneumonia goes death certificate well would counted comorbidity CDC numbers (which is). ARDS direct result COVID. That's death certificates written. 6% death certificates COVID listed result lazy death registrations. include something like pneumonia respiratory distress comorbidities result COVID.

Glad could educate yet another sheep. like all.

It's like saying someone 75, obese, heart attack died Covid-19 rather old fat bad heart.  Ivermectin showed vivo activity ~ 5 micromolar, 30 milligram pill used peak blood concentration 500 picomolar. 10,000 x away hypothesis great example group psychology. Groupthink group polarization prominent Reddit. find interesting. might 84000

Keep licking Trump's boot political pressure sure. simply undeniable. care rushed, fact rushed what's causing wait see. absolutely problem wearing mask, washing hands social distancing, continue enough studies performed make feel comfortable.  numbers reliable. hope India economically develops quickly post-Covid better capable dealing future crises. deadly virus, track LESS deaths year 2018 2019.  forget leadership history coercing medical professionals lying Nope poop sweat discharges come contact underwear. region filled sweaty nooks crannies aren‚Äôt exposed open air. People kiss strangers lips cheeks time. don‚Äôt usually lick kiss people‚Äôs armpits butts (well course nearly frequently). nearly mind. 

If trying stay safe covid washing cloth masks every day. degrades fabric. mean goal stay safe covid. I‚Äôm still waiting Easter miracle. day I‚Äôd bet. always need external enemy/rival stablize there's trouble internally

, whether that's Russia, USSR, China, irrelevant. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

But course everyone knows there's Soviet-era Doomsday machine hiding somewhere underground US government gets little nervous :S  XD cares case counts? Seems like disposable ones might better option. I‚Äôve far survived using masks lot retail stores hand free. Pretty sure coronavirus coverage free non-subscribers. wonder, overall, many hospitality, travel, entertainment industry employees still work? 
And many medical folks dealing PTSD burnout? Dr. Isaac Yankem, DDS read thought know Bonnaroo Tennessee Fuck no. Anti maskers soft spot except one head. anti maskers different antivaxxers Sure, not. Seems safe. /s really.

From Mar August, 264,160 excess deaths US.

In August, \~90,000 excess deaths, assuming September half bad, we're already well beyond 300,000 excess deaths. never known anyone America died flu, bet lot Americans never known anyone die it. lose 12,000-60,000 people year it. worst that's around .02% population. combined pneumonia, 2% deaths. know separate two illnesses since many causes pneumonia related flu. would nice see many deaths actually caused it. believe whatever DoCtOrS say? believe whatever sweaty divorced neckbeards boner pill salesmen say online like me, InDePeNdenT tHInKeR. year + see subs say


How still alive? never said people deal anything wrong- reason Chinese government things complete control population- anyone didn‚Äôt want tested, broke lockdown aren‚Äôt going get fine whatever, they‚Äôre dead future organ donors whatever want call it- dissent isn‚Äôt tolerated. really can‚Äôt compare countries treat citizens like free countries.

And I‚Äôm trying compare Trump- monster right, never brought all, simply lied beginning, still lie really can‚Äôt trust anything say, per usual. able test millions people feasible options getting test ending bottom hole somewhere- would choose? else control infection can't get citizenry wear f'n mask socially distance? Bro, centralized office creation conspiracy theories shit like that? Cause people saying exact thing number deaths covid Brazil. see scientists still trying figure virus out. forever vaccine. Can‚Äôt make vaccine don‚Äôt know making Wow. friend accidentally ran shtreimel Brooklyn years ago. googled them, go $4,000. I'm sure expensive ones.

When car ran shtreimel, guy chasing look despair face. People sidewalk cheered. crazy scene. Ireland island we're shit. excuse bad handling. ""its island "". definitely temper. temper morons yourself. It‚Äôs like radar. 

I didn‚Äôt know Mt. Sinai making shit up, go ask Twitter. must know them, lead speak them. honest things saying. haven‚Äôt provided counter evidence lmao. Idiot. mask, probably still infectious, every ACB event super spreader event! would say social distancing far biggest importance. Health personnel using real PPE still get infected, people expect it‚Äôs going happen homemade mask? Tump got sick cases ticking again. So, narrative left ""Be good soldier die masters."" wondered meant not, clicked read.

I think kinda defines clickbait, no? call BS, well known phenomena virtue bias surveys. Right. results regarding restaurants. Title misleading one. wish authoritarian state U.S. Well... remind even queen lambasted us following initial guidelines. economy works stabilise movement health infrastructure become zombie ward. lose slow infrastructure, going us suffering it.

Also, feel bad you. shouldnt get yelled showing concern others Sure will. chance numbers start dropping fast. Israel needed three weeks total lockdown that. soft lockdown need three months... Old news New Zealand definitely exists. seen Lord Rings? different lot ways actually. We've seen lot multiorgan failure MIS-C whereas Kawasaki dreaded complication generally coronary aneurysms. I‚Äôm saying virus nothing... I‚Äôm saying human body pretty good building antibodies virus already seen before...

Trump tough time breathing yes, he‚Äôs high risk age group (also obese) many people age contact virus end ventilator, able walk around speak within days. shows treatment seems worked.

Getting reinfected physically possible, 2 40 million cases? I‚Äôll take chances. Every year handful genes need renamed since names mimic names Excel functions, thus leading bunch unintended errors dataset information related genes. Wait, *two* Dakotas? getting hand. nooooooooooooooo weally!?! hurr durrr people fucking VIRUS outbreak!!!?! wanting methodology. model built based deaths 2014 2020. model used predict deaths March August compared actual recorded deaths. took death attributed directly COVID analyzed rest. noted large increase heart attacks, diabetes diseases coincided exactly places hardest hit COVID. Yup, definitely dumb motherfuker last one. ain‚Äôt person, bad worse. Tantrum? Science deserves tantrum honor faced morons like you. spit face data collected dead bodies. Believe me, hope right. Yes. it. extremely misleading headline. study saying 75,000 people died COVID. ^^^^^ 100%.

My parents early 70s addicted Facebook 24/7 shit. couple weeks ago messaged asked told watching NFL game. launched tirade BLM convicted rapist playing game, support ratings, etc. asked knew replied, ""your friend Adam posted Facebook"".

I pull Adam's page shitty meme posted. Scrolling down, also looked like full-on COVID hoax. casually told COVID denier believe since page. 

That totally blew fuckin minds lament can't trust Facebook anymore ""the news"". hopeless. masks another measure. make lack hand washing social distancing Trump crowed 'massive outbreak' New Zealand. Funny cases (outside travel quarantine) *The White House* New Zealand.

Seriously, can't manage keep *their office* covid-free really sad man. warhammer guy board gamer roleplayer here. still neighbors never wear masks think hoax. :/ Yeah, weknowdis. would 5g this? asked wore mask properly chin nose also wore mask around friends etc also wore goggles protect eyes washed hands touching face! title it‚Äôs black white! 

I know also smart asses got Covid like cousin says always wears mask bar hopping, eating restaurants, went 3 weddings, 2 vacations east coast west coast visit family friends eating restaurants! always says always wears mask sure told doctor too! Yet see IG pics crowds friends maskless! call people liars. Loudly. 1) Masks 100% effective substitute social distancing measures

2) People lie types surveys.

Edit: Seriously. Assuming folks got Covid representative sample general populace- way hell 71% people wearing masks ""always"".  71% people probably tell dentist floss daily too. Yes anyone thread advocating drinking bleach?

No, article OP misinformation going around. Well, best give facts. might case phrase ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt reason someone position didn‚Äôt reason to‚Äù applies. Guys like reason Utah's trajectory [looks like Weknowdis. They‚Äôve vaccinated 10k people? thought using P3 synonymously EUA already vaccinated 100k+ people? Hospital numbers people taking hospital beds, death numbers people died (which gets verified coroner), case numbers people test positive. Except direct control whether expose others virus? People fail realize large population is. United States roughly 328.2 million 2019. average amount Facebook friends 328 (coincidence?), let's honest, probably actually know Facebook friends, real life friend count would smaller, we'll go it. math right, means average person knows roughly 0.0001% population. circle friends/family/acquaintances/neighbors microscopic grand scheme. Hey, live FL too. Universal Disney, interesting brought up. still restrictions place, rides spaced, extra cleaning, safety requirements on. like likely while. 

Have considered reason hospitals overwhelmed people working remote, social distancing, masks, extra cleaning glass shields? 

It may another year goes away. realize science say virus nothing? possible get reinfected? 

Bruh could barely breath night doubt still feeling it, he's woods.

And yeah little sus preaching one get sick twice vaccines treatments ready thats clearly case idk keep seeing shit bots think funny name Chinese waterfall, doubt really bot funny still. CZ Oktoberfest? Munich cancelled year, looks like German Karneval lot Christmas markets wont opening either. Good news would outbreaks subsided.  They're already rising - 7-day moving average 13% last week. without social distancing hand hygiene. three equal importance. leadership incompetent unwilling provide needed aid coordination. Stop assuming I‚Äôll respond another link post one. attempts evasion pathetic. It‚Äôs clear don‚Äôt one. Well, cancer something completely different. all.

As polio, it‚Äôs virus yes body build natural immunity. get it, don‚Äôt get again. It‚Äôs pretty devastating get once, vaccine important.

Malaria, parasite virus, haven‚Äôt done much research it. basic searches show body builds level resistance, since subsequent reinfection less serious first. 

Your body pretty amazing machine üòâ flu season coming going shit show. lot people Iowa wear masks damn near every store removed lessened restrictions mask usage. I'm guessing good news people 'finally' punished rulebreaking

They going bad time though realise likely people fined able pay fines recalled significant carcinogen earlier year? weird. already linked paper economy done compared Sweden, know lockdown, 25% loss consumer spending compared 29% Denmark. know antibodies say, ""you're immune"", closest we're gonna get, right? (Just asking see I'm missing something) island, along stopping travel country, along contact tracing. plus luck side too. gj though mom MN little sister (plus young nephews) ND I‚Äôm terrified them. bring third shipment n95s post office mail sister can‚Äôt get anywhere ND. wouldn‚Äôt know link got one. thing deserve slap, gosh, deserve one. try. already linked paper economy done compared Sweden, know lockdown, 25% loss consumer spending compared 29% Denmark. People worried livelihoods. Local restaurants businesses can't survive capacity restrictions long many people work. People worried small businesses unemployment. Superspreader event busy killing innocent minorities WI seems I‚Äôm beginning understand genes introverts continued human genome mix. I'm sure whether people handle (it matter change reality), however daily discussions threads useless places try speak reason, logic, science, data days. suppose love torture coming back again. non-czechs here, illustrate absolute chaos government - yesterday, governement officials said, would close restaurants. most, would restrict opening hours again. Cue ""24 hours laterrr"".

They're already bullshiting ""if reproductive number falls 0.8 week, we'll reopen again"". course fall much week, lmao, know it. They're thing already 100 times - say last two weeks (and two days pass announce new restrictions).

Also [alcohol pathetic excuse president said ""Let incompetent go bankrupt"" ""artists always make best art they're hungry."" kid not, literally said this. can't make shit up. certainly something concerned context, LA county largest county US terms population 10 million residents. county larger population US states. 

Not trying downplay symptoms children, seems like somewhat rare occurrence. dined (not usually would), gone drive-thru last week, watched server pack food mask nose. refused order &amp; demanded refund &amp; idea much longer I'll wait try again, though least, another month. Even worse, cashier manager told pulls mask handling food, issue?  suggesting use soap directly foodstuffs? loser? know? I'd say first difficulty temper.

The second one lack data many 1 25 year olds covid-strokes.. because..you know...there zero proof boat load data that, outside sniffles fact may super spreaders, disease ain't shit kids. issues ""are kids getting educatoin/social interaction"" ""are enough people working"" even handled people, that's sign concern tbh.

One time said looked like criminal took mask wasnt mandated so... Well. cant help mindset people. healthy dont believe anything worry about, suffer comorbities concerns would take negative it. ask many never contact someone wearing mask. Cuz, know, relevant stat ##itsAllAConspiracy

It immunity waned large number people see hospitals flooded reinfections people may take seriously. way late then. Deterrence Maybe, form transports infected cells. ask authors study, test different substances report possibly others make it. Even Michigan acquires herd immunity, way keep lockdown Michigan anyone outside Michigan.

Basically... want herd immunity? 

Get everyone infected, isolate rest world rest world solved covid-19 (if that's ever thing). health minister(Prymula) said like week ago, won‚Äôt introducing new restrictions next 14 days. literally shitting mouths discrediting themselves.

We're point many LOCALS saying, yeah, maybe safe think going restaurants again.

There areas city people holding mass gatherings hundreds unmasked people tightly packed indoors. people now, finally, months, fined.

If irresponsible gatherings like stop, speed timeline us actually consider encouraging tourists visit again. got 38% necessarily mean widespread illness. usually means massively under-testing giving tests probable positives. Like rest Senate Supreme Court? No, misleading titles bad... mistaken.

If kept tighter ship summer, kept quarantine people coming country, think could fully back normal except minimal travel abroad.

What surprises low number infected. 

WHO says 1 10 globally infected. 740million. 

This means current deaths around 1/10th 1% .13% rate death.

Given US total infected close 100 million.  good news areas people egregious flouting rules months, leading rising rates spread. Much city screaming mayor governor something, they've hesitant so, partially people areas politically powerful.

That government finally acting this, good news. Forget silly doctors scientists. former reality tv star knows better cure know! Don‚Äôt worry SD gov won‚Äôt interfere

Damn I'm glad wear mask!! would odious. course technology exists trace level, going happen. it. 

I find fascinating White House interest finding Trump infected. I‚Äôm Arkansas don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre even allowed 25% honestly unless it‚Äôs recently changed. know can‚Äôt tailgate bad breath? now!

Did stop reading study said, ""Delayed care, fear seeking care emotional crises stemming pandemic could also contributed deaths?"" 1 billion americans died, study finds agenices health care professionals pretty conservative statements estimates get go.

They said beginning 

a) developing reliable tested vaccine ~18 months would quick
c) immunity cannot guaranteed based coronaviruses 6-18 possible time frame.
d) generally detailed extensive summaries every day including hospitalized, incubated, recovered people deaths, presented multiple age groups. Additionally Dashboard (map germany) daily updates every county, different colors indicating dynamic local infections.

Additionally, scientist developed first test Sars 2 distributed worldwide initally sequenced Sars 1 also. considered expert coronaviruses specifically Sars1 research.

If politicans would little careful past, could avoided PPEshortages well.

The scientific community governmental agencies provided parliament report 2012 detailed consequences pandemic. modeled Sars 1 concluded would ill prepared improve PPE supply lines since even hospitals would run fast. estimated coronvirus likelyhood spreading/occuring every 100-1000 years due condition eg. food markets. 

Consequently, put trust scientific community remain sceptical politicans. later, unlike scientist, consistent wish be. Sorry no. Zantac similar contains ranitidine hydrochloride.

At 0.6% IFR 60% herd immunity threshold (both estimates likely high side), that's like 1.2 million dead. That's huge amount, far cry 7 million. Hell, City sure use extra money. It‚Äôs reasonable expectation wait things like party (which least necessary activity people do, could easily go year without tbh) hard know believe.

1. Used data quotes faucci ineffectiveness masks, espically cloth masks. virtually uses unless hospital.
2. talked Herd Immunity keeping people inside actually allowing Virus mutate? ( true)
3. mentioned death rate low qualify type response actually pandemic. showed data fit narrative sars regular flu.
4. also mentioned history time never handled virus response way like now.

Furthermore, direct quote article stating exactly ‚ÄúExcess deaths include COVID deaths ascribed causes, well indirect consequences pandemic society,‚Äù says.
Indirect consequences could include people afraid go hospital another condition fear catching coronavirus number issues caused exacerbated COVID-19‚Äôs economic mental health impacts, loss health insurance layoffs, inability afford medications pay cuts, skyrocketing rates depression America‚Äôs adults, condition negatively impacts many aspects health.

#""as well indirect consequences pandemic society"" must difficulty reading. table 3. tested daily caught virus moment viral replication started, days symptoms, immediately checked hospital receive Remdesivir drugs, vitals monitored around clock, virus scary.

The problem is, normal people cannot that. show hospital wanting become in-patient, told sent home. Hospitals generally admit unless severe life-threatening symptoms. turned away sent home told convalesce home, come back emergency symptoms like trouble breathing. 

Once get sick enough require assisted breathing, usually late lot advanced therapies make difference. Usually imbalance already causing huge issues, rushing play catch up.

The advantage daily testing catch virus gets foothold, checking hospital huge.  advantage middle class cannot get. simply told no, turned away sent back home again. Can't tell one group cause okay others isn't? absolutely can, wtf talking about?

I didn‚Äôt mean make sound like couldn‚Äôt. meant legally can‚Äôt shut gatherings others based worthy think compared others. 

If talking personal views apologize shouldn‚Äôt engaged continue get worse longer leave things propositional logic critical thinking public school curriculums.  good point. America first! I'd accept 20-30 years.

Or guess could say excess deaths next year 60,000 lower average 2016-2020, hold true 5 years compared sliding averages normalize. Worth comparing number previous lockdown started.

Get stupid crap. Trump administration may come said publicly, sure seem made decision go herd immunity route. they'll cancel Hajj know serious idea testing contacts anyone positive anyone thinks exposure get certain baseline positivity rate, iirc like 5-10%. place lower that, testing sufficiently higher that, testing broadly. 

so 30% could triple testing, yeah would go down, catch ton people going caught stands, means stands lot people unwittingly spreading it. This. know getting downvoted. I'm Argentinian confirm that's happened. quarentine work people mass media actively sabotaging it.

That's crazy. mean, know anyone Crohns, absolutely idea ability serious. Horrifying, terrible way go... say virus survive 28 days? I'm saying airborne main mode transmission since aerosols travel 30-40 feet obsessive cleaning surfaces help much controlling spread. certainly much higher reported numbers. Unclear *Covid-19 Essentials* offers mask styles [optimally Lots masks seals though Masks counterproductive / work. dead wrong.

To fair, Facebook friends. also US Surgeon General. First all, please think I'm stalkin' browsin' regards COVID.

Secondly, common practice put Virus reason death sheets. last stage Cancer die influenca (Because that's last drop brings Body down), nobody bats eye really.

A Friend mine works field biological laboratory technician, better started study become Med. PhD - Anyway, explained biggest issue COVID is, kind Virus ""new"" us Humans. Yeah, COVID forms existet much longer, recently mutated infect Humans. 

Now we've issue immune system can't really cope pretty much fine healthy body ""Virus Infection"", probaly livin' Country warm water pipes, enough food etc. - survive.

But soon certain conditions, impact Virus Infection like COVID amplifies - result death.

Now people questioning: big fuss it?

Easy, ... Well, Old people example highly endangered Virus example. people mostly rich havin' alot influence? 

Yeah right - Also mean, bring point: 2% Humans sound like much, one 2% loved one - think would change thinking many.

But I've heard concerning rumours Turkey COVID handling - rumours heard 'I wear Mask'-kinda Guy reason share publicly. 

Anyway, overall - COVID ruse entirly enables Gouverments / Companies certain things. example, hope still need COVID App trips abroad COVID finally someday. Wonder idea many people infected spouted bunch ""but extra deaths!"" bullshit that's irrelevant initial point. Thanks. Oh boy, one knows badly fucked country India is... that's crazy there's article sub china got COVID touch! factors? You‚Äôre right disparity cannot directly linked covid, else would die from? simply true - always announced testing limited due testing capacity took long actually increase testing criticized months end spring/start summer.

You might mixing death report numbers people say quite accurate (especially compared countries hidden excess numbers) spreading conspiracy theories faking numbers. aware poor fined. say that?

Plus, easy one avoid. fucking break law. come we're okay saying time, measures meant save human lives suddenly upsetting?  we're store get make choice. could cough potato chips breathe aisle come along later even around. ghislaine maxwell, Stormy Daniels. may exposed Saturday. get free testing, read multiple places 5 days exposure (with day Day 1) soonest get reliable test though asymptomatic people may show positive earlier. called testing place verify woman said could 11-14 days there‚Äôs point getting test symptoms appear-which doesn‚Äôt seem right especially since website emphasizes offering free want every single person get tested. I‚Äôm confused trying figure save trust negative test quarantine spare bedroom partner understand positivity rate relevant.

That means testing lots people virus, lots people virus. could lower substantially testing lots people without symptoms, raise testing people symptoms. available everywhere expensive boot. compromise wear masks store. wear 10-15 mins everyone safe. Seems reasonable right? guy Hong Kong infected twice symptoms second time would also like add douche canoe. never voted him. Glenn jacobs anti mask since beginning. fought health department every step way demands every single business stay open matter what. want cry many people believe trump scientists doctors. Please send help knoxville. struggle real dealing Ya know ask. idiot? believe doctors scientists? 

It researched study you? doctors telling young people dying isn‚Äôt enough? making up? somehow know do? Well, it‚Äôs gone New Zealand. creating virus lab? article says nothing this. schools area closed one week. Cases popped everywhere thought good. they're enforcing it, bad news ‚Äî enforcement necessary.

Whether complete scamdemic anti-masker doomsayer, good news $0 fines. SOURCE ALL, making shit up?

I put mine up, find better one want continue, guess keep pouting asking leg work you. study done ln dark elminate degradation UV. tried elimonate many variables could establish ideal survival environment viral viability plastics. anything stay airtight room 24/7, taking risk. 

If someone gets sick me, near me. chose near me, that's them. say vaccine microchip conveniently forgetting phone well Australia much much better USA, UK, Europe countries. Current situation Sputnik V vaccine:

Phase 3 trials ongoing, 10000 people vaccinated results Phase 3 trials could realistically available mid-November, data ~1000 plan publish interim results based first 42 days monitoring volunteers means Russia high chance becoming first worldwide announce data final-stage, phase-three, trial. first 5,000 volunteers vaccinated September 9, means interim results could issued time October level antibodies could reached 2 weeks injection, plateaus 3-4 weeks. individuals require shots produce immune response 7 effect new cases numbers would seen earlier December, likely January - assuming mass vaccination starting early November, 3-4 weeks develop protective antibodies (start December), 1-2 weeks lag (lack) infections (lack) positive test results recorded statistics. assholes.

Why LA mayor ARRESTING them? Even shut down, also shut schools mandated WFH, make much difference. put back zoloft taking many years. developed tinnitus time. went back ssri zoloft made tinnitus way worse stopped. made tinnitus worse louder even stopped. know. even see irony comment. NYTimes fake news. USA #1 sub isn‚Äôt designed people formal education sad situation can't blame people. already tough age getting even less time family normally would hard.  Finally optimistic piece NY times \^This. live Argentina people give crap anymore. given crap quite time now. wear masks use neck accesories.

Also, want start opening schools amidst 16k cases day. saying kids depressed miss buddies. moronic that? real reason want parents working (because economy going shit) can't stay home raising kid. 

It help newspapers pushing agenda really hard.

As teacher, feel like soon exposed really dangerous scenario. irresponsible parent send his/her kid school hiding fever symptomps ""How met Covid-19"". worst thing busting butt teaching students Internet authorities really give crap. number.

Anyhoo, hope everyone great day! seeing logic that. Polls that; polls. done phone internet anonymously. consequence honest. margin error. Even accounting clear narrative ""vast majority care anymore"" true. 

We look indicators evidence. Job losses, unemployment, net gain/loss small businesses. United American airlines furloughed 32K workers. happen people back pre-covid behavior. Yes, people, general, taking risks becoming lax, however still long ways go society goes back pre-covid behavior. news likes focus idiots spreading false misleading information, acting irresponsibly, many others look data, try keep tabs science best possible, listen experts. important remember 6 months illness, suffering, death, economic disruption % infected U.S. likely somewhere around 10-15%. Herd immunity likely somewhere around 50-70%. going take vaccine get want be. Best guess? shitload animals crammed tight quarters, animals well, species may susceptible coronavirus. Mink relatively small, I'm sure there's metric assload happening.

Dogs cats would issue, since we've seen covid animals. stuff factory farms fur.

I'm animal farming animal disease expert tho, course. (good) ways estimating percentage US coronavirus based upon confirmed numbers? winning looks like!  sub love lockdowns, videogames mantained free government, think contracting virus equals contracting ebolavirus means sure death. losers like lockdowns. don‚Äôt think enough vaccine exists. yes actually helps would get vaccine. takes two doses doesn‚Äôt it? know spread virus elsewhere provides strong rational basis belief contact tracing aggressive testing near contacts done, rampant community spread. link doesn‚Äôt say anything title. So, clearly Florida here, also corrupt, inept science-denier charge. I'm sorry, awful. is, level, logic it. all, migrant caravan going come destroy southwest? *That* disappeared election season, it? minds, virus thing. isn't, course, *slightly* less stretch may first seem. Access health care plays part. healthy peoole died european countries well. care, fear seeking care emotional crises **stemming the¬†pandemic** **could have** also contributed deaths, says, well inaccurate death certificates **may have** misidentified COVID-19 death*



You forgot make certain phrases **bold**


Also every reasonable person knows lockdowns needed.

And quote dosent mention lockdowns problem, yet act like does. Never know try it! Please stay denial, get tested. testing saves lives all. no!!!!! must think pure thoughts!!!!1!!!1! theorize unknowns use numbers are. argue number cases much higher, would indicate rate death lower. makes hard agree situation come good policy. time CDC continuously strive improve accuracy statistics. Absolute legends  Buckle up. 2020s got twists left. got tested 2nd hand exposure couple weeks back nurse said 4 days post-exposure fine standard PCR, 5 days rapid antigen. PCR much sensitive test turn-around time get results back vary 24 hours 3 days. 7 days thought optimal waiting length PCR give accurate results. voting brigade began yesterday reason.

No, began back August. There's two big ""skeptic"" subs, name want contribute publicity, made point troll sub. German thought remembered something MERS SARS vector types animals. Knowing politicians breeders Country (I Denmark) entirely economics much sob story breeders whip media. Almost every day largest increase record... sure, also remember Brazil getting hammered well. almost heading summer time there. Luckily two hour flight n95 mask. I‚Äôm pretty vigilant this, ton people work depending staying healthy. 

This flight definitely riskiest uncomfortable scenario I‚Äôve involved last seven months. hope don‚Äôt get sick too. Wait times may normal, part attractions reduced capacity. example, Pirates filling 2 rows per boat. Plus, rides get paused every couple hours cleaning.

So, queue times growing crazily, shows crowds still way down. seem like that, social distancing fastpass, queue lines much visible take lot space before, interferes getting around parks too. 3 icd codes x60-x84 op link explains are. Apparently hang covid killed according cdc actual proof since two studies broad list symptoms two studies make science. 

If going use words like 'certainly' need hell lot evidence. one way find !  possible. Take look Huhan early February. even read article? conducted study circumstances aren‚Äôt normal everyday life. Grow troll somewhere else. Yeah, good luck that. work LTC hit April (staff residents testing positive) *so many* staff quit immediately. STILL fully restaffed. reason crisis yet people passing away faster move people in. full capacity, ability provide care would suffer. start staff get sick again, certainly people quitting. care them? close due staffing issues, go? one women work 10 weeks. staff willing take chance. safe bubble now. infections since May. get visit- *way* want. selfish.  Right, lost 100k souls official books conspiracy theorists covid deniers heavily backed encouraged GOP quick denounce entire pandemic get rich quick scheme many people acknowledging actual positive tests direct result try stymie paranoia increase mask usage.  


In short, dumb people take proper precaution stupid understand reality we've taken approach skewing data towards lower metric recordable understand actual significant threat loved ones hopefully start adopting proper safety precautions.  


This weekend snapchat filled maskless weddings, karaoke booze filled house parties, small social family gatherings 6 people weekend getaway girls trips. Give another explanation I‚Äôd happy take account. People don‚Äôt die sitting around houses. God please let US get involved something safe efficient. rich put poor circumstances, yes. Kids need physically go school.

But corporations need kids' parents go work.

And era helicopter parenting, means daycare needed long past time kid able own. schools serves function. tell covid last 2-3 months 

It i'm immune moment?

It can't tell that. Corona unlocked zoonotic shift

""Some may gotten virus infected workers. Dutch authorities say farm workers later caught virus back minks"" Probably european country

You act like completely unreasonable say despite china known censoring everything makes look bad. Remember Tiananman square? Shit like people trust chinese government know, information coming China CCP accurate reliable China everything perfectly handled sure. Nobody LIKES lockdowns, people lucky enough effective lockdown slowed stopped spread community. Schools open hybrid.

I believe charter free county districts letting students attend class option virtual. and/or less visible consequences either COVID societal response COVID.

Examples like: People delay, defer care conditions. People go ER chest pain. Consequences depression, suicides. ""Those people gonna die anyway."" GOP  worries, appreciate looking. I'll try find him.

Ultimately started rewrite code go 18k lines database purify information. filtered multiple times doubt missed duplicate non-covid death somewhere.

Thanks! [655,000 people per year die heart per CDC. It‚Äôs likely year (unless it‚Äôs called C-19 death) many people going untreated. 

Look - I‚Äôm still saying sad. It‚Äôs *really* sad - death tragic *every time*. I‚Äôm trying say everything else kills people world, life sooo fragile anyone could wiped tomorrow car accident, falling stairs, gunshot, push button (N. Korea anyone?). likely? Nope, honesty neither dying C-19 you‚Äôre 60 reasonably healthy. you‚Äôre at-risk - whatever feel safe, fully support that! Personal safety in-fact...***personal***

People lost everything measures ~~put place~~ forced us. things worse death? think certainly be... that‚Äôs I‚Äôm trying say - let‚Äôs let people choose what‚Äôs safe them. wife‚Äôs mental health much critical time risk C-19 we‚Äôre 30‚Äôs reasonably healthy. interaction older people, I‚Äôll probably cautious keep distance...or least ask want keep distance (although older people know aren‚Äôt really scared want live best remaining years planet). Good luck trying get people listen restrictions past April next year agree. People sick restrictions. number cases keeps ticking upward. wonder two related. cost one fighter jet military? Cool. One aspect it: rich powerful access much better healthcare average American. even get link posted. Kinda seems like want push narrative bullshit Let people live end lives want to! You‚Äôre evil POS deny elderly type joy end life. Period. Tldr: 2022 read article, bro live right-wingers indirectly trying question coronavirus exists, designed new world order, bring ""mysteriously disappeared China"". going 9 million tests week going disappear. shows Americans far worried economy COVID. How? says mayor town hosts Bonnaroo. lot words definitely words wrote. I'll google are. appreciate advice I'll add list things look regards site. I'm hoping constantly evolve thing add people it.

Also ages thing. pretty hard figure regex age Obit text, simple happen years stated born-died. happen years able pull use age. vast majority people wear masks required that, eat restaurants, go school, play sports, weddings, etc.

All things worse wearing mask grocery store, types events causes cases didn‚Äôt say same, cannot even read, lazy intellectually dishonest that? said accuse counterpart shortcomings. agree people happy there's probably great majority people living great I've got three factories China One Taiwan one Serbia one Mexico I've done business six countries well last 23 I've 26 countries 49 states I've sailed across two oceans I've Panama Canal four times I've walked South I'm well educated understand culture understand America peak talk freely openly Tiananmen Square people street?

Boomers man....boomers. know gonna vote come November third.

If looking profile think come conclusion, think might need check again. clue I'm voting assumption entirely incorrect.... which, yes, assumption least mine educated throwing shit wall hoping sticks.

And no, discussing dog Trump. Childish BS like always.

People frequent r/politics generally think they're right usually opposite. Par course.  Imagine conveyor belt. timescale birth death everybody on. ‚Äúnatural‚Äù place everybody falls off. Covid comes along pulling people 6 months would hit end conveyor. first, death numbers elevate, pulling everybody reach early, everybody dodged still falling normal time. pandemic progresses equilibrium reached. Covid disappears, maybe 2022), force yanking things conveyor gone. natural end conveyor isn‚Äôt sometime future.  Deaths period drop. pre-Covid average little while. So, I‚Äôm correct, that‚Äôs see. moving in-pandemic average starts look like pre-pandemic average. post-pandemic drop mean. equilibrium reached again. don‚Äôt know tell you, isn‚Äôt something need interpret read carefully. ‚Äú30s 40s‚Äù age range clearly refers people COVID. subtraction 15 years clearly patients without COVID. really see that? 

And know, 72 69 age range British Heart Foundation. 

Let ask again, actually think doctor saying average stroke victim without COVID 30s 40s? Additionally, effect sudden rise deaths, say tsunami, fall deaths compared normal afterwards since would died following period died then. name effect, can‚Äôt remember called. big spike see due covid probably means death rate causes would lower later, instead still expected. order get actually death doll due covid beyond excess deaths-expected, even factors equal, point out, fewer deaths areas fivethirtyeight averages data points early October. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  need construct bubble live inside next 2 3 years. There‚Äôs way. Make sure people feeding wear hazmat suit approaching bubble well. honestly probably shouldn‚Äôt eat food prepared anyone maybe packaged foods thoroughly disinfected. Might ok...  Hm heard ""just let us push months/weeks everything solved"". Oh yeah, first lockdown. literally can‚Äôt even keep drugs prison. aren‚Äôt stopping bars operating. redstate.com may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* I'm sure feds authority limit interstate travel - probably can't done legal level. I'm absolutely sure single state categorically shut borders 49. Even could, practically speaking, residency permit system like do. never know since never tried. Me: take risk virus

This sub: could spread old person 

These old people: I‚Äôll also take risk

This sub: *confused screaming* let italy pass us again? think trying say excess deaths even deaths attributed COVID, means either COVID deaths currently reported, stress COVID situation leading extra deaths, combination both. Taipei city means they've let mildcases go means they've let mildcases go astute you, sir. Yes means pandemic.

Guess that's get get talking points Fox ""News"" Study finds study Covid fomite transmission reposted 28 days. Ranitidine hydrochloride (zantec) different ranitidine bismuth citride, one take meant gastric issues, later anti bacteria. 'you aware something without terrified'

Thats I'm trying remind people of.

Fear harmful physical things world. ‚ÄúIf saves one life‚Äù stfu lockdowns restrictions ruined countless lives what?? ‚ÄúThe coronavirus pandemic may caused tens thousands deaths spring summer previously thought, new study says‚Äù

Real funny ‚Äúmay‚Äù left headline I've waiting see long something like would take gain traction. one thing many people pretend pandemic exist try go normal lives completely ignoring right. Trump contracted virus seemingly ""fine"" fear cult see sign run headfirst herd immunity now. 

Its going rough winter, Covid likely even worst part stupid idea. Viruses form life stay living surfaces idea you‚Äôre talking mean, humans never gotten herd immunity virus... anecdotal experience reality. Violent crime, accidental deaths, drug overdoses, exponentially country right now. full shit  one fundamentally strongest reasons need wear masks, social distance, take virus seriously. healthcare system cannot handle waves endless patients. People ignorant see past reason take things seriously. Plus, point time ""flu"" ever put many people hospitals. 

There logic believe hoax. probably psychological issue idea life change whether like not, brains cannot adapt situation. Plus, help US, commander chief spreads covid without repercussions people commuting less traffic. 

if less traffic fatal traffic accidents down. 

but death rates up. 

Therefore, corona death rates make difference. 

Which say compensate lower traffic deaths overall lower accidental deaths since fewer people overall.

that specifically mean. Hey guys, put strip double sided tape bridge nose press mask it.

Zero fogging. Try it! glorious. merely agreeing headline article, 

""And _agreeing_ actually mean completely disagreeing."" -you Truly amazing China managed treat [cluster 71,000 then! Right, ""outliers"" norm, seems person troll, one can't critically think. 

Seems school failed guy several fronts think you‚Äôre missing point. 

They‚Äôre testing plenty identify outbreak starting. Testing wouldn‚Äôt change knowledge status countries involvement pandemic. 

If positivity rate 75% getting 5k cases, would agree problem. documented cases, plus long lasting affect information provided isn‚Äôt solid enough you? certainly seems like verifies claimed.....you don‚Äôt want believe it? Cult personality?  provide actual argument, certainly citations facts, farrago lies.

If debate class, thrown stage initial incoherent ramble probably drug tested too.

By way, humans _never_ gotten ""herd immunity"" viral disease ever. common cold, flu, AIDS, polio, herpes...

So possible reason suspect would happen now? argument China intentionally released virus world (through central hub city), actually make China hell lot competent executing plan. Oh sweet summer child. Absolutely! Medical professionals expendable colleagues important us Yeah stopped testing asymptomatic close-contacts recently, fun illness whose spread mitigated wearing mask. Oops! should‚Äôve clarified. gonna beers, gonna wearing mask. didn‚Äôt feel like drinks night, (initially) OK hanging night, fight started. Sorry, that‚Äôs bad clarifying. Diagnosed COVID ‚â† death COVID

Come back new talking points Fox company deaths. How'd get covid potato chips? mean get bag chips inside bag?  literally science says it‚Äôs possible contain using basic measures. It‚Äôs never done history virus widespread COVID-19, you‚Äôve said technically misinformation.

So people keep giving examples......

And reject examples using ""special pleading"" logical fallacies like wave away. 

It contained, contained multiple countries places, large small. 

And that, still lessened even can't contained, setting false dichotomy well. China offered help Hong Kong additional testing capacity HK people spun ridiculous conspiracy secret DNA harvesting operation. imagine country would citizens equally worried shipping samples China. Teaching thankless, it. Im also teacher going 10 years honestly, hard, best job I've ever had. 
Maybe wait safety, please give up. source, fact. drink, almost drink alcohol anyways  die then? easier that. Fox News likes create nothing stories drum votes election. (Migrant caravan, anyone?) election over, just.. stop talking Since fox drum votes election, liberal media thing. longer using election, they'll stop covering it. Since nothing story anyway, nly covered he'll Really, projection way down.

I'm confused comment. I'm sure even talking about, maybe missing something.

Are saying virus nothing story, coverage virus (which way blown?) stop election? Oy vey study compared strain flu lasts around 2 hours skin. Go search study read decide results must wrong.  Plus, easier control people taught hard think research risk infection INDOORS, people masked, one person infected, less 6 feet away extended period (like hair cut, long conversation, etc.)? Can‚Äôt find it...thanks advance! sure NY state, NYC back 1% last month so. Yup wait over. ""yes. 3 relatvies died."" Granted 90s nursing homes, 3 people.

Give months. thousands people continue die every day, odds people know someone died increases dramatically. Pool testing enables large numbers tests positivity rate low. way less useful positivity rate 10%. rub lenses bar soap mask up. Statistically speaking, probably people thread saying get vaccine, still happily smoke, snort inject dubious street drugs purchase sketchy drug dealers. ""Well hey bad USA!!!!"" -esque comments really nothing extinguish valid criticism Japan's poor testing.

Being better situation US point. I'm really sick people comparing every country US.

I leave that. read title article. read comments saying Sweden‚Äôs actions ‚Äúcriminal‚Äù words one redditor.

So Sweden bad. criticizing #14 people front - almost used strategies suspect favor - *a lot* worse? literally true! body produce vitamin sun. means mean actually produces enough. predominantly farmers living lives outside. 30min closet enough. Also darker skin less sunlight converted vitamin vitamin deficiency common darker skinned races. summer guess blood work came back still take vitamin daily. Don‚Äôt spread misinformation could cause harm. people think giving basic accomodations luxury?? I'm advocating avoid lockdowns economy, least - feel sorry famine poverty parts world. said, saving economy never argument locking Sweden.

The excuse? 

As pointed out, know whole economic outcome yet, GDP similar, government debt much worse terms projected/trending debt, except Norway used oil fund. 

One reason could Sweden much export depended, except Denmark, shipping med-tech seems needed pandemic. country go unaffected whole world close down.

But real reason actual outcome Nordic ""lockdowns"", Sweden included, basically exception schools. 50, even 500 max gatherings stopped basically events. Bars open late March, empty. say libraries, bath houses museums (several closed Sweden well) big economic drivers. change fact countries carefully selected make Sweden look better are.
Another list (of comparable/more comparable) countries would make Sweden look like shit.

The person(s) choosing list clearly agenda. guess Sverigebilden thing again? I'm seeing logic. hated America, I'd totally enthusiastic Trump. He's damaged America President history.

Has occurred people psychopaths like yourself, actually want see America suffer, that's _why_ hate Trump? stopped buying foods particularly hard clean altogether toddlers make 88% population? Germany batch testing first, Korea. one operated China's scale two choices slave labor let run free rehab time served? life extremes? Cuz thats def reality, bud Coulda 2 million yo - Trump glass half full somebody recently said argument virus ""i freedom go want!""

and said back ""yes, freedom uneducated dumbass virus too""

know said ""yes do! thats right!""

LOLOLOOL FUCKED CDCs data all-cause deaths US. Here's death stats.

2020 - 2,167,730 (as Oct 9th)
2019 - 2,225,000 (end Sep)
2018 - 2,122,647 (end covid killed well 200k people country yet we're right average 2018 2019 terms all-cause deaths. That's probably 80% people dying covid going die something else year anyway. Canada, 80% deaths assisted living facilities. US, 93% deaths senior citizens. excess death young, healthy person dies something could prevented. 80 year old alzheimer's stomach cancer dying covid ""excess"" death. I'm saying minimize tragedy anyone losing grandma, give perspective disease. exactly kind person mind.

Sweden one world's highest fatality rates, highest Scandinavia. absolutely argument this, yet want deny it. Lunacy. Japan: lockdown, complete shambles testing system, one oldest populations (if oldest) Death rate per million: 13

Given bad Japan's testing is, might surprised find Japan's data deaths rather haphazard: saying Japan bad many countries, level testing piss poor population. say, older population major area concern yet testing remains terrible. mean ""always fixed""? countries don‚Äôt seem harmed masks convinced masks control them. ashamed country amazing. Early pandemic friends facebook anti-lockdown, anti-mask, etc kept saying following:

\- Excess mortality higher, mattered. dead wrong.

\- Masks counterproductive / work. dead wrong.

\- guy england estimated 1,000,000 possible deaths year batshit crazy. dead wrong.

\- time 500 deaths. said going fight keep 100,000. called crazy. dead wrong.

\- approached 100,000 deaths, said 200,000 easily possible worse. said crazy, look trends. dead wrong.

\- think 400,000 deaths crazy. smart, accomplished people I've known long time. politically indoctrinated can't listen scientific consensus convinced ""figure themselves?"" Yes. think it‚Äôs safe say two many factors yet draw definitive conclusions COVID counting (280k excess deaths vs 215k officially attributed COVID) based excess deaths. Psychological causes death due lockdown shouldn‚Äôt underestimated, particularly since deaths due depression drug overdose (opioids) trending higher even pre Covid. 

It also helps keep mind larger context. 280k excess deaths 8 months translates 420k (280/(8/12)) year .1% pop. extra 1 1,000 people die year. believe it‚Äôs likely COVID directly contributes (above deaths officially attributed COVID), also wouldn‚Äôt totally shocked locking people homes months enough cause increase well There‚Äôs point conversing you. stupid. Goodbye. I'll stick glasses quite much waiting room exposure. one done might feel differently, there's lot follow-up.

Yeah, addition people waiting room, follow appointments going small rooms close proximity doctor technician. disappointed seriously many supposed medical professionals taking masking distancing within offices Florida thousands cases hundreds death people continue go Disney bars beach business usual.  It‚Äôs fear mongering, valid concern. I‚Äôd rather hearing actual risk‚Äôs constant numbers. Except could release global pandemic world like need complete total understanding exactly many people virus order deal it. Testing widespread minute see America novel. wish people see understand post. competent leadership looks like. Calling systemic racism grift. we've already established car deaths down. illnesses? bother. I've encountered selfish core. sees pandemic affects him, affecting us all. 'Ah yes, ""Coronavirus"", variable symptom virus allegedly kills, maims leaves apparently untouched explaination. dismissed claim.' Caring deaths = wanting people dead?? buy Calcium supplements usually include small amount vitamin pills exactly purpose. US nation Billionaires poors Geeze can‚Äôt assume test expensive people, aren‚Äôt even getting tested? wouldn‚Äôt spend $120 either. Give free testing I‚Äôm sure numbers would accurate. something else entirely! No, means days runny nose. vast vast majority cases almost certainly caused spreading directly one person another yeah. wash hands dont think much risk all. like bedbugs. find one means thousands. Hopefully bad like analogy. First, they're referring CFR article, IFR. That's big difference.

Second, mention R0 all, many additional people one person disease infects. [flu [Covid-19 around still know (as far I'm aware) long-term effects Covid-19 health people die. many examples people get permanent organ damage deal rest lives.

Fourth, already well-studied available vaccines flu, Covid-19.

Fifth, [ZeroHedge awful source. know people fine 1000 IU day spend hours outside sun week. 2,000 IU dark skinned northen climate. Anything overkill unless absortion problem like say maybe Chron's, old, pushing 80, like Fauci. hit 200k like freight train stopped dead tracks keep hearing infection numbers rising pretty sure 300k point speculation. American companies working antibodies could given money create American jobs? Cant go without drink couple weeks? think basically every Asian country pretty much complete control outbreak?

Because test lot?

Or people populations aren‚Äôt divisive morons collectively know properly act pandemic? sure that. 

Remember, China created world's greatest ubiquitous surveillance system, civil rights.

From friends live there, report there's outbreak police shut area city day two, vacuum anyone might exposed disease put ""hospital"" somewhere. people family called hoax ""not bad"" even husband got back May dealing complications ever since. went working every day going hikes morning runs getting winded take dog short walk even though got lived still chest pains troubles breathing prior getting it. ""low risk"" 28 year old supposedly scared ""you're young! get fine!""

Makes mad hear people downplay take seriously. Japan: lockdown, complete shambles testing system, one oldest populations (if oldest) Earth.

Death rate per million: 13

Here countries considered golden standard pandemic response whose extremely harsh answer emulate: 


Australia: 35 
Greece: 43 
Phillippines (yes, people think Duterte responsible man): 57

Not mention former darlings Czech Republic Israel. ""both sides"" same, lazy intellectually dishonest assert are. Exactly this. Prisons actually made rehab you, made exploit still seen data 1 25 year olds stroking Covid19. raise mask little higher rest glasses *top* mask. fog then. fogging, poor seal top wrong.

Source: hospital worker glasses. problem R number 1. lowered adopting controls keep schools open address problem suitable manner thinking. Even places severe restrictions everything schools.

If can‚Äôt lowered enough without closing schools close everything schools closed shortest period possible. 

I fully agree increase MPs‚Äô salaries period insane. madness beforehand many wages stagnated, time national crisis thousands losing jobs seems petty. suspect many MPs given increase charity (they often do), don‚Äôt know sure. don‚Äôt think 8-9% positivity devastating make be. 

People attitude virus gotten bad many countries.

You act potential virus, current aren‚Äôt testing lot Covid isn‚Äôt really problem there

*Groans*. Yes guess completely forgot initial reason lockdowns Europe avoid overwhelming hospitals, Swedens experts realised didint need lockdown accomplish right. goalposts moved lockdowns worked better expected countries people decided goal every country completely eliminate virus. would friends person? another person understand randomized, controlled study is. Dear god, amount ""I want *new normal*!"" shills subreddit insane. Thank goodness they're (mostly) downvoted! closed minded. know hydroxychloriquin also proven effective treating lupus. said makes people poorer hurting them. stand post. see point trying make, tracking tracking anyone shared supermarket infected person, would throw alot negative tests. hard lockdown lasted 3 weeks maybe month, really lax Indeed; makes comparisons difficult. counties like Peru Ecuador reporting perhaps even knowing dying. places like China could anything. places like Middle East whose excess mortality don‚Äôt even know. What's argument? misunderstand issue agree think work together unified nation stop this. 100% agreement there.


The comment replied competent leadership looks like.

That sounds good looks good quite true people choice there. That's leadership. That's dictatorship. word leadership implies example directing guiding bringing forward people.

In China say take cannot disagree powers-that-be say. That's leadership. That's absolutely freedom. Well, entire argument rests assumption one time vaccination get immunity life, doubtful. see current immunity wanes couple months similar diseases like influenza yearly vaccine. makes think coronavirus? 

Now, profitability. Assuming profit margin say 2-3 dollars per vaccine pushing legislation worldwide unless vaccinated - refuse selfish murderer allowed house, uptake guaranteed - assuming production ramped cover 7-8 billion doses - covid19 vaccine 14-20 billion **guaranteed** profit per year. Also, vaccine likely injure huge number people (Bill Gates admitted this), need treatment injury compensation paid respective government's tax money! 

Now much would treatment PPE make comparison? read it. recommended lockdowns making people poorer causing problems. What's argument? something worth sharing, would sharing peer reviewed study.

Stop wasting everyone's time anecdotal bullshit. suggesting MMR reason children less affected virus? see studies simulate various real life settings? aunt died COVID two months ago week almost got fight person grocery store saying wasn‚Äôt real shit. It‚Äôs infuriating tolerance anymore. people try reason selfish assholes, can‚Äôt won‚Äôt. added bar closed Kitzloch staff tested positive virus, elsewhere village, thousands unwitting tourists continued skiing partying. single person comment trail talking Spanish Flu. 94% thing disinformation campaign. 6% death certificates filed incompletely, comorbidity listed. comorbidities rest mostly result virus, like respiratory failure. still thing? Get life. Lots people use hydroxychloroquine successfully. malaria. Good old ""Wolf Warrior diplomacy"" work. Making enemies every day. sub censoring scientists ie Focussed Protection, killing people. idiots downvoting anyone says lockdowns night best solution also killing people.

You fools know talking about. Try listening scientists.  Wait ""if want lockdown must mental illness"" crowd comes downvotes shit. Ohh. Got now. Yeah question. shit. sad tragic. Hahhahah 12 cases... HAHAHHA, yea right. like 120 000 Kalief Browder Story - I've never infuriated system. Also Netflix. even upsetting find young man's case norm rather exception (unconstitutional waivers speedy trial specific). innocent black teen, spent two years gang ward Rikers; story end there. like 13th, might already seen it. five hour miniseries doc. conversation sweden right now, new york.

Stop trying change subject. pathetic. cannot stay topic, stop harassing me. crazies everywhere places fanatical anti masks two countries mentioned think much presidential cult. know people places South America super right wing problems masks part cult like that. Given state American politics culture, head line could shortened ""Bill Gates Warns 'Lots Additional (COVID-related) Deaths Coming' America. Another example serious China takes fighting virus vs western nations. kind effort takes serious citizen well government cooperation. Like 5 day holiday sole focus everyone tested.

In western nations (US particular) you‚Äôd ‚Äúgovernment don‚Äôt tread me‚Äù ‚Äúgovernment authority racist‚Äù protesting civil disobedience national media social media piled inflammatory programming profit clicks commercials. side dish foreign intelligence crafting click bait misinformation content stir things bit extra. sharing bag chips someone positive joke uhh you‚Äôre walking around public uncovered neck deserve happens you. conspiracy 200k died US. üòÇ Sounds like panic mongering. lockdown lax

Tell people lost jobs business.  Interesting. imagine would. Unlike Bunker Baby thinks it‚Äôll go away ignores completely. catches *still* massively downplaying it. \*frustrated groan\* difficult keep schools closed extensive periods time. Even say ""fuck education, without year"", huge worms itself, schools effectively also function daycare. Countless families rely two incomes, parent cannot always stay home child, even effectively take care child even work home.

Hence, know far positive cases report. People say hoax? I've never heard anyone say this, Chicago area everyone wears mask. Whether that's actually helped us one seems know. attribute excess death Covid? 

What increase things caused lockdown, e.g. Lockdown, higher unemployment, suicides, drug overdoses, etc? 

I really understand report. Could please help clarify? still laughing hate country. likely trump office, want see high death toll , works way make Republicans scape goat. Like many Redditors say, guys want Republicans dead, that's guys practically wheezing Trump got Positive result. Already it. I‚Äôm good health. turn. Excess deaths real stat. Yes tangential deaths like said, enough make whole disparity. mentioning complete. clear, vast majority extra deaths covid caused nothing else would fit model. I'm sorry metaphor made upset, understanding situation factually scientifically incorrect.

There deaths due government, media, social response Covid. deaths could avoided argue otherwise call *me* mentally deficient presented fact extremely rude. 

Suicides gone due social isolation financial stress. social isolation financial stress created people due pandemic. Social isolation closure business trait virus - trait human decision making. note neither forced pandemic.

The fear spread social media regular media made people scared go hospital heart attacks strokes. 50% fewer heart attack patients months. trait Covid - trait human decision making.

The list goes on. point response Covid ""necessary"" (and never attempted FWIW). undeniable fact killed people reacting way did.

Now, debate killed fewer people we've saved. many people prevent dying Covid? many people killed response? age health demographics people? Thinking questions political - minds every single person. saving lives we're doing? That's ultimate goal it? us sociopaths rooting virus, even accurately understand information take personal precautions. Hope things going alright everyone. can‚Äôt even fathom everything happened year pandemic insanity that‚Äôs happening US. 

There many people thought cool I‚Äôve cut life can‚Äôt even look eye anymore. Personally, family pretty serious ideological division come head year. everything transpired, can‚Äôt see us ever honestly.

When see people post world ‚Äúnever going back ‚Äònormal,‚Äô‚Äù means personally. don‚Äôt know ever could. Eventually, virus go away everything else happening right die down, world functionally ‚Äúnormal‚Äù again. deep down, know things can‚Äôt go back ‚Äúnormal‚Äù everything I‚Äôve witnessed year. 12 positives (most likely also known). comes Chinese approach pandemic better use actions indicators reported numbers. measures mean, failed contact tracing, better country likely. must thousands tens thousands known cases lead action. coworker like that. annoying fuck, like dude knowing someone who's died ENTIRE POINT RESTRICTIONS. feel sorry famine poverty parts world.

That nothing lockdowns. export prices agricultural products reduced countries went real reason actual outcome Nordic ""lockdowns"", Sweden included, basically exception schools. 

The closing schools public facilities along far smaller group sizes allowed 'basically same'. Nordic countries took far stricter measures rewarded far less cases/deaths per pointed out, know whole economic outcome yet, GDP similar, government debt much worse terms projected/trending debt, except Norway used oil fund.

Right, might well say there's basis behind economic argument lockdown. idea that's hard.

For record, also know whole economic outcome country containing pandemic quickly. That's Apr√®s-Ski you.

Basically Mallorca snow. Yes are. Probably guy running multiple accounts I‚Äôm sure tabulated data.

Yet made populustic decisions rest Europe, country actually let experts make decisions Sweden resorted methods impossible democracy

Nothing democracy prevents person wearing mask. Many people wearing masks due message receiving, due belief needed. People need grow up, care ever single person come contact with. concerned without shutting country down. appropriate term people idiots.

Many political commentators, starting early 1856, interpreted word ""idiot"" reflecting Ancient Greeks' attitudes civic participation private life, combining ancient meaning 'private citizen' modern meaning 'fool' conclude Greeks used word say selfish foolish participate public Probably differences driving culture America Slovakia though. People still people end day, Slovakia fairly small country mountainous country. 

Not mountainous roads lots turns problems bad driving conditions bad drivers... Doctors report number hospitals. Hospitals report CDC. CDC filters information White House. White House lying start covid 19.

Make sure vote governors locked state caused this. Make sure vote Biden dont want see wanton destruction continue.  economic cost trivial. latest estimates China mass testing something like $5 USD per capita, $45M 9M people. contrast, Melbourne lockdown estimated costing [on order half billion dollars per Even Australian testing costs $50 USD instead $5, testing Melbourne would cost $250M worth make lockdown 3 days shorter. Given Melbourne's lockdown 2 months already, absolutely ridiculous tried testing everyone weekly virus goes away.

Europeans. least know someone taking shit seriously. freedom what? freedom go die COVID 30% country would rather kill people via pandemic miss Fudruckers? Exactly noboday cared back anyway. true. measures work. Even mandatory mask wearing works significantly. doesn‚Äôt nothing. need coherent national response. Well, someone tells excess deaths lockdown (which completely implausible), show excess death rate Sweden. lockdown - also significant excess death. Also, Norway Finland, right next Sweden, lockdowns, noteworthy excess deaths.

Admittedly, even though Sweden tighten up, excess deaths went tiny bit slowly countries, probably due summer.

That said, Sweden prohibit events larger 50 people. like nothing all. Also, Sweden sparsely populated country, also plays important role. Plus, unlike e.g. France, Spain Italy, people Sweden culturally keep distance, that's another thing aware discussing Sweden.

Finally, people simply aware pandemic, acting rationally, already significant effect. kind sad countries, apparently way stop spread draconian laws.

The small grain truth that, yes hospitals get reimbursed covid treatment. Hospitals get reimbursed treatment provide. Covid patients need bunch services, hospitals bill treading covid paitent.

Then somehow twisted hospitals marking everyone covid get $$$$. scam! completely understand. lost Dad COVID May. sincerest condolences family.

The starting comment replying saying competent leadership looks like.

I never argued competent part yes seems competent may even working well others try mimic it.


It's leadership words arguing against. giving kind credit feel credit due. simply cultural disagreement believe authoritarian style leadership models. recent widespread use term ‚Äúnew normal‚Äù concerning say least.

How people exist mirror: China understands science economics, regardless much little care workers. Trump loving acquaintances asking Trump downlplayed anything, demand proofs Trump admin downplayed lied it.

A month ago PROUD lied it, showed leadership.

Two months ago convinced bad downplayed it.

Now ask proofs. I'm Florida get tested regularly, city in? Norway‚Äôs deaths caught (and closed borders). Unless believe couple thousand Swedes went border huff ‚Äòrona breath towards side? None links provide number regarding strokes 18-25 year olds, perhaps isn‚Äôt easy thought.

I think go back read preceding comments chain. Someone said weren‚Äôt concerned health chances dying getting extremely sick virus rare demographic. Someone else countered flawed analogy knowing 15 planes crash day choosing fly. flaw analogy pointed out, presumes equal distribution deaths COVID-19 across demographics, actually skews heavily towards certain demographics. comes claim personally issue with, one everyone else unable verify, ‚Äú**many** surviving 1-25 year olds strokes‚Äù.

I‚Äôm trying civil here, think zealous posting self-satisfaction get right something telling people perceive wrong, I‚Äôm going level you. believe COVID-19 serious disease. someone thinks reaction overblown it‚Äôs flu. problem wearing mask. adjusted personal behavior align advice health authorities given. say self-congratulate, demonstrate take virus seriously.

But afraid going get stroke COVID. I‚Äôm afraid vulnerable person society might (or something worse happen), willing adjust behavior take disease seriously. don‚Äôt understand nuance troubling you. actually believe **many** young people strokes contracting disease? understand event continues happen still know everything going on, **many** young people strokes, wouldn‚Äôt least preliminary data support claim?

Regarding economic toll. economy religion. It‚Äôs simply reflection society works creating goods services. It‚Äôs weird fanatically religious people get regards economy. government place system make sure needs met whilst enacting temporary lockdown it‚Äôs good. one going hell didn‚Äôt praise almighty economy 24/7. 

Regarding health effects. positives greatly outweigh negatives one could conjure up. lol 200k dead disease completely vulnerable it‚Äôs ‚Äúoverblown‚Äù. Ok. many assumptions one comment!

What think symptom is?

Edit: according CDC, 214297 Pneumonia deaths reported first 40 weeks 2020 (this number increase death certificates filed CDC let's use now). 

For first 40 weeks 2019, 129708 Pneumonia deaths. 

Where think 85k pneumonia deaths come year? Can‚Äôt decide it‚Äôs comforting, depressing, realize disphits everywhere. could contain stupid, serious centrally managed response public health disaster. don't... current catastrofuck. hate say they'll agree unironically. surprised.  called analogy, bang on.

It could simple. agree Kamala Harris 100%. vaccine comes scientific community believes reasonably safe, I'll take it. vaccine comes scientists saying can't endorse safety taking vaccine there's enough data, I'll hold taking it. ‚Äúthe problem world intelligent people full doubt stupid ones full confidence‚Äù makes sense. keep forgetting leftovers survivors could left with. sounds like colosseum extra steps That‚Äôs comical. like fraction. So, what? Fewer cars road seems safer people comfortable driving like idiots? Hasidic Jewish community worst human beings imaginable. Hmm sure. stating trends I‚Äôve noticed metropolitan area.

Could anger frustration average citizen elevated right now, thus manifesting driving habits? Seems make sense. Feels like everyone nation bit heated 2016. It‚Äôs like got chip shoulder fellow American‚Äôs takes less cause explosive reaction. listen C-SPAN every morning, disturbing amount people think this. Man thought lived butt fuck nowhere. 

BC huge part Canada, complaining reason  people 50s could lived 30 years whatever managed condition had, got covid died.

Sadly also people aside young resistant taking precautions things safety... answers I've gotten kind retort are: 

* ""those numbers fake too""
* ""you're lying"" - one literally thought personally manipulated search results
* ""stress manufactured hysteria killing people"" - broken clock right twice day kind scenario. entirely wrong, mean pandemic real. feel pain. Although family, guys served Marine Corps. don‚Äôt get it, it‚Äôs frustrating. It‚Äôs awkward. It‚Äôs aggravating. Sad, we're going parade looting/rioting/arsoning hour afterwards. :( Yea, kind doubts ""halfway"" vaccine. Probably gonna long ways now. People multiple times day cars. 50 chances dying car crash higher dying COVID (not including risks car crash necessarily immediately deadly paralysis, permenant organ damage, weeks trauma ICU getting trach/hole throat PEG tube feed you). 

But, yet, banned cars ü§î need testing more. could contain virus mass testing, nowhere near need be. fatality concern. two possibilities survived survive, many different possible outcomes ranging perfectly fine serious complications. 

But personally, biggest concern none that. causing death someone else. pass disease parents failed take precautions dont survive, would view fault. knew risks, failed take precautions, put danger. live conscience. difference government actually wants PREVENT outbreak, let ride. Deaths RELATED Covid indeed much higher. 't take account lack medical needs met people without covid, die lack care illnesses. Covid killed 200,000 much heart disease increased medical needs met? Diabetes, malnutrition, obesity, etc... met proper responses, medical field lacking. different countries, stuck 1 boat  Even parents 80 years old, risk dying would 12%. that's certainly nothing sneeze at, serious risk, people age bracket survive framing ""very likely"" die flat wrong, typical hyperbole pro-lockdown advocates. need hyperbolize catastrophize, instead dealing facts science?  It‚Äôs Utah. Sunday. 1 most. use vs idiots use much lower numbers yeah I‚Äôm sure. think per case fatality rate going come techniques improve, it‚Äôs unlikely ever get low 0.1%, there‚Äôs also appears significant post Covid tissue damage, might improve refinement treatment. R0 endemic COVID probably also reduce somewhat. COVID doesn‚Äôt antigenic drift way influenza may able one vaccination every 5 years avoid it, one infection every 5-10 years.

I think balance it‚Äôs likely remain influenza‚Äôs nastier big brother, controllable via vaccinations.  Lots unknowns though, pure speculation. vIrUs WaY sMaLlEr still rookie numbers, America First! Nailed it.  people wearing mask lockdown. that, back February CDC tests contaminated reagent? Huh sounds similar experience always thought me. feeling brain fog years know it. I‚Äôm pretty rural area, traffic hasn‚Äôt fluctuated much I‚Äôve seen loads accidents usual. Also work local travel throughout day it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm commuter noticing things first time. Idk could nothing anecdotal really seemed people driving like crazy Nice copy paste top comment. That's easy, think caused 250k unexpected deaths? covid there's *another* killer unknown running wild locked indoors till find what. mean, least covid know protect yourself. Canada likes think better US comes race highly suspect that. maybe little better alot better ‚ÄúI‚Äôm healthy young everybody else age doesn‚Äôt affect me‚Äù Ignorance really reason aren‚Äôt world standard country anymore.

This article isn‚Äôt one I‚Äôd necessarily look different sources on, asked bot could used elsewhere. people don‚Äôt accept facts gotten proficient mental gymnastics nothing change minds. 

Watch this:

‚ÄúThe excess deaths, real, us shutting economy China virus.‚Äù

There‚Äôs point arguing them. infected Coronavirus develops Pneumonia dies, died Pneumonia caused Covid-19

How know?

WHO estimates 80% people Covid asymptomatic.

So old unhealthy get pneumonia test positive Covid death exactly determine emphatically asymptomatic?

What got Covid 2 days ago exhibited symptoms?

Do write ""Died Covid?""

This completely illogical. guess.

Unless prove death happened DIRECT result Covid ans nk meana blind guess. mean, reply got downvoted, so...lot stupid there, friend. comment correct, know downvoted. Genuinely would curious see studies regarding 1-25 year olds lasting ailments Exactly. Crappy article &amp; clickbait title. I've seen floating around conservative social media bit, Sarah Huckabee Sanders curious coming contradicts every report - basically look CDCs cause mortality numbers 2018 2019, appear par 2020 seems like be. However, gross misinterpretation CDC data falls apart dig depth even merely read footnotes CDC's website. would love unionize. IIRC California nurses unionized mandatory safe staffing ratios fairly great state work in. top comorbidity listed pneumonia, caused covid. Comorbidity definition includes conditions caused primary condition: medical condition patient causes, caused by, otherwise related another condition patient. saying died pneumonia, covid, *is* like saying died bleeding brain, car crash. One issue excess death calculation may still low goal learning many Covid19 directly killed, could high.

Two examples, anecdotal evidence people driving dangerously less crowded roads, vehicle accident deaths down. Covid19 indirectly saved lives would lost accidents, subtracting deaths ""killed Covid19,"" number seems incorrect. time people might dying heart attacks fear going hospital delay long. Again, Covid19 indirectly responsible deaths bodies. 

I'm saying excess deaths accurate official count best option have, remember numbers estimates, read 65K uncounted deaths, plus minus 10K. true? thought careful? ‚Äúwhich independent preexisting conditions, severity overall course acute illness, time original diagnosis.‚Äù Another article cited study referred cohort patients containing asymptomatic patients. tards still protesting lockdown literally everything open 75% capacity. scary think nurse taking care patients might kill remembering giving medicine. 

The American employment system awful clearly sick person forced work ran leave. counter measures affect viral load person receives - would affect lethality rate. Trumpism true cancer, I'll tell what. older people easily spread towards? sudden stroke deaths former covid previously asymptomatic positive teenagers early 20s college students?

Do critically think consequences actions? people like still fucking lock down. 

Stop edgy bro, wear fucking mask stay home. going answer question, downvote. Thanks sheeple! Also, truck driver motorcyclist couldn‚Äôt get ICU bed full covid patients then... yeah, mean, covid role deaths. Fuck dead sister long mask stay 6 feet normal people (the ‚Äúlive life‚Äù crowd) NBD. friendly reminder Trump administration still failed secure reliable universal day testing still national contact tracing program whatsoever. Oh yeh, also working overtime kick 20 million people health insurance give wealthy backers another tax cut. Save election thievery. bullshit breathe exactly like always have. always gum listerine strips hand.

Surgeons drop dead middle multi-hour surgery wearing masks. people pouty children easy cheap way cut transmission?  dude 10% country currently positive would hard aware that. realise Fox News, CNN, BBC, Sky News Vice spewing anti-Chinese propaganda, right? insane lmao government used DNA testing sites catch criminals past, overblown exactly made either Argue lockdowns want can‚Äôt honestly call sub science based 

Out things focus on, choose one? 

Anyone submit link, high-quality sources information accepted posted sub, usually stories related science field like epidemiology virology. 

If hard time understanding please let know. Link report itself, seen article:  Catch early steam eradicate pretty quickly. would humans go shops... needs skin. Thanks. title click bait.  Oh god, yes NZ remote island ways short travel.. yes easy keep U.S. 54 million people 65 pre-existing conditions. 50 million 65. universe think rational societal response 1/3 population risk be, ""They get instacart."" shouldn't. days polite unabashed stupidity end. Now. 59 day old account says reeeeeeeeee way explain saying either covid unknown disease begun tracking. know outbreak started? Ok come now. lied world going months whistleblower made known. guy mysteriously disappeared. Stop praising China fucking monsters every regard think wouldn‚Äôt capable purposefully sabotaging nations virus, well don‚Äôt pay attention atrocities commit daily basis people. want Republicans dead. making lot assumptions beliefs.  Crazy Republicans charge everything yet dems keep getting blame  high us positivity rate April? Western media really brainwashed everyone thinking China sort Soviet-era dictatorship. Whereas capitalist regimes, labor resources get anywhere level care. I‚Äôm talking myself. everyone afford instacart everything handled Instacart, many risk people caretakers still go work go public things instacart doesn‚Äôt service exposed ‚ÄúLive life‚Äù crowd. areas don‚Äôt even delivery services could afford it. Again, point stands. mother COPD, expect privately pandemic kill her. She‚Äôs fortunate wealthy able isolate, she‚Äôs taking risks lately, people around her. wants things normal, totally appreciate, I‚Äôm privately preparing worst.


How many times tell parent they‚Äôre going die go grandchildren‚Äôs birthday parties start ignoring you? ... rig numbers! Maybe China better us friend drinks last week. said, quote, ""I think worse flu."" head nearly exploded. city council. elected make decisions behalf residents town. everything send multiple articles see like every day (because that's going help anyone). I'm disheartened.

ETA: Also, reason we're discussion Donald Trump Boris Johnson Jair Bolsinaro, among others. consistently tell residents respective countries worse flu, people actually believe them. Actually easy beliefs base beliefs feelings ideology reality lie, like initial outbreak. Probably mix both, telling ratio is. wait systemic racism come context there, done that, quite work expected. Here's allegory I'm left with. Say I'm guarding door room man eating wolves it. one see what's behind door. I've stated many died passed door, I'm prevent chaos.

If open door ""prove it"" ""make sure"", problem I'm probably going die, person insisting door opened see themselves.

That's world view pandemic right now. absolutely agree everyone viewpoint, wait proof.

But wrap point, subset people far angry I'm blocking door, kill need prove wrong. Afterwards others reflect happened day. many people need ""prove it"" to, save rest now? level irony never thought possible thought opposite like China write died heart condition instead died COVID government wants keep numbers look good thats talking though, read comment again. Florida pretty low new cases per capita

Those reported numbers can't possibly real. know thing literally forced people locked inside apartments countries said ""no need economy keep going need travel keep going""

And that's China's fault how?

Virus's originate places. countries fault. Sometimes leadership even downplays that's really shitty, government STILL downplaying it. watching videos people literally locked homes January youtube. like governments warning China taking seriously even verbally downplayed it.

But making China Money important worrying ""it's cases"" think see problem, first link tabulated data 2020 since February, excludes January Agree you, people fear criticise China, many seen heard sides story?

This video explains better That‚Äôs argument position. vaccine possible we‚Äôd choice accept deaths. vaccine imminent know every death could prevented bit effort.  event guy talks never actually happened. Simplify life:

You 0-5 days surface room temperature light.

* buy groceries, stick anything perishable box corner. Leave week, shop next. Put away get new groceries. produce handle this, keep top.

* Anything cold, wash cold water dish detergent rag. need waste bottle alcohol put bleach food. Soap water take care packaging.

* Anything cardboard &amp; cold like frozen dinner, dump onto clean surface without touching it, put stuff away washing hands. stuff factory assembled unlikely gotten contaminated inside packaging. 

The change requires make life week's worth groceries ahead time (which frankly have). Please go watch China vlogs made Westerners YouTube. see that's really case. lot Chinese citizens well-educated virus happy lives. Technology development China slowly outperforming west. bury face Western media. distressed things going back normal one day? normal like kinda sad? Yet people believe woman freedom govern body. body choice applies convenient them. Since speak Norwegian, ran Google Translate. deputy health director Espen Rostrup Nakstad says interview NRK believes **the Swedish strategy fight coronavirus wrong way go.**  believes Swedish strategy result people becoming ill time, means burden healthcare increase difficult control major outbreaks new places. Depression, anxiety, substance abuse rarely listed cause death.

Just nobody died stock market crash.

The officially causes death range car accidents heart attacks.

And Florida least restrictive measures... hospitality tourism industries still decimated... Unfortunately careers also high mental health substance abuse challenges.

Nobody children's official cause death read depression, alcoholism, depression. Must nice supplies they
 hoarded ""not problem"" one talking real elephant room. Analysis killing thousands people. best testing used baseline/control.  know folks really grasping straws attack *age Reddit account*... lol   Looked US world numbers morning I‚Äôm feeling defeated. Don‚Äôt even know say point.  say exactly could cause fevers? I'm gonna piggyback also say medical professionals ABYSMAL educations respect diet nutrition part standard education (meaning, unless specialized something related). least US. also disastrous problem.

How expect general populace understand proper nutrition professionals even able coach patients correctly?! No, you‚Äôre one who‚Äôs brigading sub. always walk around discussion threads your, ‚ÄúMiSiNfOrMaTiOn‚Äù self-righteous crap. It‚Äôs really, REALLY annoying. majority reddit anti social people LOVE leave house. relative die ‚Äúpneumonia.‚Äù suspicious. idea horrible idea herd immunity would even work case, confirmed cases reinfection testing negative scientists studying idea antibodies even stay system extended period time Lmao Redditor 1 month nothing spreading misinformation. How's weather Russia? meant antibody testing, specified. course 10% test postitive one day. Point comment really emphasize large portion community goes covid without experiencing symptoms numbers reality much higher. remember beloved Dr Birx said back March would best case scenario fatalities handled perfectly?

Let remind you.

 don‚Äôt really watch news. watch Fox News would also watch MSNBC. truth typicallysomewhere middle middle news body articles shrinking news outlets realize people read titles anyway. Experts say 2025 news conveyed meme format reduce literacy requirements minimum. here's Batman weather...  Holy shit, Iran reported 272 deaths, largest daily high ever Iran dealing virus longest. comment flies entirely face previous comment called death million. rightly removed mods. 

We absolutely prevent deaths. one highest death rates world. deaths inevitable. deaths magnified misinformation politicization procedures reduce spread. That‚Äôs doing. 

Again, educate stop trying edgy comments. You‚Äôre scientist. You‚Äôre authority. You‚Äôre redditor likes argue bad faith. compared lying dictatorship hid severity disease months save face. Sorry. Realizing asking different question. attempted search match search term would nail source. see sites dont nessacarily trust saw press briefing president March so. ‚ÄúSigh****  can‚Äôt government like China‚Äôs?‚Äù  Oh well /s Sorry hear it. Thank information though. piece shit work still says hoax definitely pandemic caused feminization America think it‚Äôs ok. want come contact humans realistically half year thing. need level face face human interaction stay sane. breath like always do. new? already knew Here's difference. China testing much understands strength regime built upon trust vast majority population ruling class. Keep population well-fed, employed healthy, reason revolt demand change. 

In America, government elected supposed accountable us, leader (and cronies) know thatnwe blame third party anything bad happens. Rising cases? much testing. Large death toll? is. 

Its fucking retarded ""democratic"" government case acting way benefit consituents, knows act way harm without accountability. mean current government may voted botched response. account unnecessary lives lost? lasting health damage? mental health issues? economy might hurt much responded better? Funny enough Disney World hasn‚Äôt single outbreak virus they‚Äôre taking better precautions setting stricter regulations entire state Florida. Nice üëçüèª well said. Sounds like need instacart, friend. obviously pandemics live like forever. 2 cousins dead family still think hoax. Oh, shut fuck up. Nah good efficiency bad totalitarianism Link vid? kind want see Kane cut anti-mask promo. Especially ironic given wrestled one many years. Yea pass getting it, even though I‚Äôm young healthy  Bill would busy pissed Texas. Imagine material. big true ""Do Research"" There's political clout behind lockdowns. Neither party political capital implement one right unless literally bodies street. happen. Reddit search. *that* lazy. Yup, people definitely realize socially undesirable 100% honest everything they're pollsters. Apparently issues contact tracing, people want admit contact tracers risky places they've been, say something like ""oh I've going walks, know could've gotten from"" thus making impossible contact tracer job us get good data places virus likely spread. WhHhHhHaAaAaAaT?!?!1 Incredible results. nasty bug.  Daily reminder new normal never thing. short time lockdowns, curfews, masks thing look back laugh.

You can't fight nature. can't. Knowing less lie, means number higher, know it. So, might able sweep rug. Like, would test whole city 9 million *just* 12 people?

Remember, country welding people inside apartments earlier year. video it. 

Also country tried utterly silence doctors trying right thing back December/January. tried keep secret. Catching strains? hadn‚Äôt heard this. seems like strains mutated ways evaded immune system entirely would seen many cases reinfection now. 

I realize individuals proven reinfected found different genetic makeup virus second infection compared first. haven‚Äôt heard confirmation strains reinfect cross immunity, virus mutated way changes strain enough differentiate immune system. High schools universities, I've idea. Older teens young adults learn home parents working, seem quite high level drivers infection, looking age based breakdown. 

Younger children bit complicated. look reports data seem point catching less frequently recent post, I'll put provide sources. Long story short, we've seeing isolated cases primary schools, seem like they're really strong vector spread. I'm googling ""primary school covid outbreak"" double check latest news, I'm struck almost every article seems members staff infected (like group teachers party outside school). seem tested less frequently either--the testing demand school children blamed overwhelming test system. data shows around 626,500 youngsters swabbed 28 May end August, almost double number 70 79-year-olds tested, 364,000, aged 80, 350,000 tests completed. noted BBC link above, rate testing increased since went back school non-covid coughs fevers become rife. they're exposed 70+ year olds, frequently tested age group, LESS heavily represented infection rates age group, what's explanation? % positive among younger children also low, suggesting due lack testing among age explanation for: 
-high exposure peers 
-high rate testing 
-low infection numbers 
-low % lower likelihood also preliminary studies suggesting prevalence/severity lower parents children ten. understand hypothesis work? Scientists never ever claim findings 100% accurate. always include words like ""may"" ""likely"". 

But like use theories basis learning someone poses another theory debunks previous, assume information accurate. 

So assume deaths underreported we're likely caused covid one way another. think misunderstod. numbers rising minimizing numbers, analyzing numbers understand them. read say claiming. average redditor know think critically. \*Laughs Texan. point arguing, exactly? Glad position power MSM recognise uselessness harm lockdowns? ever admit it.

Sweden laughing us now. sure understand work. can, shouldn't. He‚ÄôS GoTta wRiTe LiKe wAnTs sArcAsTiC. consequences could include

Strange state, fact, carefully worded disclaimer discount possible situations may covered due limitations study?

It's almost like fervently full shit read adult level. got infectin' game on. March - July, reasonable people know country never lockdown long. Kids school till mid March. People back beaches Memorial Day. Shops, restaurants, bars, etc reopened. People causing trouble masks businesses June. Disney opened beginning July.



Its unreasonable think 200,000 -250,000 excess deaths 5 months weeks partial lockdowns. defeats OP's argument though pretty revealing. everyone viewed returning standard behavior ""normal"" socially undesirable. actually showing people sub pushing ""no new normal"" issue mainstream, engaging socially undesirable behavior, know it. think buying time for? genuine question, I'm single mom child bad disability, living across pond. Thank I'm ""that person"" too. feels pretty lonely come internet find like-minded individuals reaffirm I'm entirely crazy cautious. ** Hold beer ** could setup vending machine offers free inhalers coronavirus allow interested herd immunity volunteer services cause. We‚Äôll see committed really are. agree. have- pay others area extra $3.75 hazard pay. 

But hate idea increase wages tempting people say compromise valid health concerns $$. feels dirty. We're place staff residents safe. I'd like keep way. Vote No. Vote taxes poor? anything taxes idiots. consider Gain function research ‚Äúcreating viruses lab‚Äù would seem aren‚Äôt case. actually gain function research time, one seems bat eye it.

As said there‚Äôs medical reason human challenge trials don‚Äôt see would put people that. that‚Äôs decide, I‚Äôm medical professional. decided benefit people volunteer it‚Äôs place tell can‚Äôt do.  drive home work see people still hanging bars restaurants. Much seating outdoors indoor seatings half normally...but still! drives insane. Every night want roll window shout, ""Go home! here? dragging whole thing out. like this!?!""

Last time sat restaurant mid-March. another masked friend Knoxville well. been... Mind blowing. people tried eating less? house people COVID positive, would assume strain bother quarantining masks. know that's right not.

I drive another house someone COVID positive, though. pandemic affecting everyone. they're tired pandemic reach pants, grab balls, deal like everyone else. Stop trying change lockdown it‚Äôs extreme China. ‚Äúrestrictions‚Äù still form lockdown. People still losing livelihood government shutting businesses. Stop semantics. Shhhh. üòâ might better stay apart much can, make infection worse increasing viral load around other's infectious. essential workers bending backwards get test? Every pharmacy city offering test universities open administer tests masses people. Rapid test 20 mins 48 hours maximum Despite agreeably minimal effect virus kids, spreads others vulnerable teachers parents, forth. sure taking hard black white eye lens though, agree closing schools. optimal response would online classes minimal person, would include special needs, poorer children, can't afford laptop Wi-Fi, parents can't leave alone work.

Still, pivoted hard initial point. long term effects unknown, focusing kids making statement change mind someone formerly complying mask mandates social distancing, could care less achieved. deceived false statistics Facebook groups speculation initially, using manipulation bring back reality feels justified. TUI worlds biggest tourism company made 19 billion 2019. like 15 TUIs... will** True. Sorry say one kind people believe covid-19 joke that's people watch Fox news still want make america great again. needs add penalties non-compliance remove sheriffs openly defying compliance. Likely due failed health care system country?  Good news, lost credibility since start pandemic. bought CCP. LOL. utterly incoherent now. great day thanks chuckle. Yeah, March thought shutdown distancing, maybe could go back office 6 months.

I didn‚Äôt account anti-maskers, general unwillingness people adapt. pandemic accompanying lockdowns massive wealth transfer younger, poorer Americans older, wealthier Americans many want acknowledge. extreme segment haven‚Äôt responded pleas education, called violence journalists claim ‚Äúherd immunity‚Äù - stops continuing endanger districts health care workers, it‚Äôs good news

Although agree flair kind stupid. it‚Äôs good unless behavior changes. would hilarious wasnt serious issue. Note sheer numbers point. Texting 23x dangerous not. distracted driving number one cause accidents . know virus, NYC lot people various illnesses get treatment many died you‚Äôre saying death isn‚Äôt covid death caused covid disruptions? know. I'm annoyed one seems think minute try make decent decay stats real-world environmental conditions real-world saliva infected. sick bullied international community first world war needed someone blame. Hitler restored national pride gave hope. also know anyone gassed lied government right left centre many issues including role Jews society. Even many Jews believe gassed got trains. Impossible! know anyone that's died gotten sick this!

/s It‚Äôs lab grown, lab created strain. certainty it‚Äôs actual virus. follow plan get put work camp...The nazis really good mobilizing mass labor too.... think Vietnam's victory impressive since benefit island isolation. terms staffing...how paying more? amount money assisted living facilities make ridiculous. Hello u/T0rrent01 True, people wearing masks less capable respecting social distancing rules curve grew FAR rapidly It‚Äôs May peak either. May continually entire month May ‚Äúpeak‚Äù would May 1st so. guess call ‚ÄúMay 27th‚Äù peak wanted absurd we've spent 16 trillion fighting coronavirus can't even find couple billion fight obesity? Obesity kills 300k every year kill half million every year coming decades. Lockdown pretty unethical idk Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  Yeah, here, know extroverts surviving (assuming going partying normal). ""Not people under-report socially undesirable beliefs, also over-report behaviors socially desirable. PEW explains, ‚Äúresearch shown respondents understate alcohol drug use, tax evasion racial bias; may also overstate church attendance, charitable contributions, likelihood vote election.‚Äù - means serious consequences rule breakers. fined hesitant break rules future. 

Also fuck can't pay. braindead they'd nothing worry about. Again. perfect people died lies. Especially knew ahead time. hell, even knew. made stating masks not, cringey. Zealand used World Health Organisation spokesperson example country whose Covid-19 response effectively communicated New Zealand lot clarity expected things going done that's extremely important, people understand what's going happen going happen.""  New Zealand advantageous position suppressing virus early really bringing numbers down.""  Dr Margaret Harris, spokesperson World Health Organisation Thanks comment, puts things perspective. It‚Äôs really easy get caught reading catastrophizing clickbaity news articles, it‚Äôs really important remember that... catastrophizing clickbaity news articles. course, reasonable, ‚Äúboring‚Äù headlines like Fauci saying ‚Äúwe get return normal‚Äù don‚Äôt get nearly much attention, clicks, reddit upvotes headlines say ‚Äúwe never going back normal‚Äù. Tell airlines, night clubs, thousands business cannot open since March.

Do see school university open? no. enforced. would guess even more. people deffering care also getting sicknesses would gotten wearing masks including infections, flu, pneumonia etc well fewer accidents general due lowered car use roads. Exceptionalism breeds meritocracy Close f-35 cost 90 120 million Kiryas Joel, 2nd largest hasidic community NY, disabled children routinely taken away mothers put ""foster care"" uncle, leach money state. Moms say matter. agree would called ""made lab"". Cultured &amp; standardized maybe?

Nothing different would created. There's always chance spontaneous mutation, happens wild too. lab, (hopefully) notice. helpful, thank much! Using actual numbers odds 600 survived least 68%...not nearly 50/50 people based 330M population we'll probably accurate number coming weeks  calls quarantines times either, even health scientific leadership. don‚Äôt think possible stop virus getting in. countries islands like Taiwan NZ. seems hindsight biased say started quarantining fall 2019. Perhaps every country earth done Oct, almost none did. mention millions border crossing Southern border don‚Äôt go customs, shipping containers human trafficking.  LoL. True, Sweden apologists/maximalists like always love skew information way possible hide atrocious preventable deaths Sweden had. happens default selection suits narrative. someone a) isolating themselves, b) masking, hand sanitizing, distancing rare outings, c) washing hands return, d) staying vitamins (C &amp; especially) would catch flu? Nah, 4% improvement mortality. better nothing, much. certainly major breakthrough treatment game-changing treatment changing mortality 4%. acting like WRONG night clubs schools closed. not. That's happens PANDEMIC. also idea businesses opened since March. That's straight misinformation. opened weeks end. Even city.

Out 10 people, like 8 wear facemask, 8, guaranteed 3 chin covering nose. impossible quarentine work way.

People complain moan government, organize private parties, football matches open restaurants crowded ceiling, protocols all. impossible quarentine work way.

They respect guidelines, wear masks incorrectly straight wear them, respect social distance say COVID cold. impossible quarentine work way.

Media downplay lethality effects virus constantly. Feinmann, Etchecopar, Viviana Canosa (who recommended hydroxychloroquine treat virus, indirectly causing death 5 year old child) Leuco (who, remember, celebrated off-camera doctor told cases rising system collapse) blood hands. impossible quarentine work way.

Many anti-quarentine rallys organized, people physically assaulted journalists burned face masks pire. impossible quarentine work way.

Almost start (probably starting 2 weeks) media certain sectors population, clear agenda, ignoring quarentine, downplaying importance virus spreading misinformation. absolutely impossible quarentine work intended, properly enforced first place, people media boycott sabotage constantly. Wrong, read article, mention study published journal ""PLOS ONE"", journal ""FEBS"", refering to. Also link contain author Michael Holick. spreading false information purpose? know that, agree, wrong cover up. feel sorry ""them"" (not sure referring to). never said angels applauded.

You know, actually, government getting huge props handled pandemic people. Local government approval rates around 70%, national government 90% iirc. local government (I'm sure national gov't did) definitely fucked trying cover silencing doctor later died COVID. job, trying save people's lives applauded that.

So basically could've turned really bad CCP apparently got consulting sociology professor (in states think--I'm going totally memory report NPR heard weeks ago) said could actually make (the virus) positive thing, good job. Kind like Trump might remembered great president rose challenge.

So basically situation is, large credit go people Wuhan bore worst lockdown (it involuntary), CCP able show Chinese people, ""Look upstarts, younglings. We, oldest culture, know best. Look freedoms done them. totally chaotic America right now. look China, look us, CCP, done people improving economy benefited millions (though still great wealth inequality China growing, like U.S.) know best, system best, thing control"". 

Plus, Trump pushing ""wuhanvirus"" conspiracy, CCP responded kind. places apparently afraid white people now. states, whenever Trump uses words, ""kungflu wuhanvirus"", puts \*me\* risk, Asian-American. fact, I'm Taiwanese-American, know anything two country's history other, know we're allies diametrically opposed China. mean, China wants take country parents immigrated from. I'm pro China means, like said, I'm trying prove point black white. meant three tier restriction system. Yeah im sure one confirmed read first confirmed lol. first comment was, idk OP getting info. But, able find info directly related OP talking googling it. Directly related claim, whilst accurate claim, still substantiated claim. preliminary study provided mortality data 15 days, full study followed study participants 28 days found among receiving remdesivir compared, 11% passed away compared 15% among placebo group.¬†

So...only 4% better nothing mortality. useful, impressive treatment turn tide without masks social distancing. 

I think avigan performs similarly far repurposed antivirals effective accurately barely effective. better nothing, nowhere near game changing level treatment. guy psycho, fired spot mom one people üòî Given cases go everywhere restrictions loosened (that analysis done...check sub), surprising ? Don‚Äôt fine living daylights citizens starters!

CA issued fines face mask violations $100-200, enough act deterrent nothing make bankrupt.

NYC‚Äôs cases schools decided open person restaurants allowing people eat indoors again. Indoor dining prohibited CA schools still virtual learning time being.

NYC also experiencing huge uprising Hasidic community tough restrictions place that‚Äôs making things worse.

It ultimately comes people making good choices terms overall disease prevention. Levying fines work long it‚Äôs excessive. $15k way much extremely counterproductive. Point one person wants everything locked forever. Maybe hyperbole reacted? so, I'm sorry adding toxicity. Death rate lower 1% Say Philly fans, folks climbing polls, standing top vans/trucks scaling awnings, significantly less folks danger! work cold? 

Clearly get sick again, whats misinformation bro? 

Are doctor specialized immunity research? always produce antibodies unless auto-immune disorders something mean going able fight infection since caught lol, based understanding get we're immune? 

Lead Paragraph:

Widely used MMR, MR live attenuated measles vaccines (referred collectively herein ""MCV"" measles containing vaccines) theorized author reason children, teenagers young adults rarely symptoms COVID-19, deaths attributed COVID-19 young populations. author go explain herein many different outcomes related COVID-19 happening different countries. There‚Äôs reason immune system would uniquely unable respond coronavirus.

Cases reinfection likely due different strains virus, unique immune deficiencies. Generally though, there‚Äôs reason believe bodies can‚Äôt build lasting immunity coronavirus. think we'd done nothing all, would hit around 500-1000 deaths/million hitting herd immunity, based looking various countries worldometer, i.e. Sweden, Netherlands. seems like we'll 300K-400K US covid deaths assuming immunity lasts, pretty terrible/unfortunate. believe substantially control virus hits critical mass (feb/mar) without extremely strict measures, depending miracle vaccine backup plan rather main plan. guess point think non-targeted interventions come massive cost really need weigh tradeoffs policies. Agreed Thank you! believe practically risk return normal life. it‚Äôs Easter? mean next Easter? Apartmently Israel datasets orthodox Jewish neighborhoods showing consistent reinfections. scale dozen per district. article posted days back Still, appreciate correction. meant great fine people dont use facemasks, thats unexcussable IMO.
I agree, sometimes impossible discuss, people get really nervous starts spreading fake news BS OP said many 1 25 year olds strokes. Huh. What's first word headline responding under. name subreddit? covid winter coming. argument ""covid flu"" folks. ever flu season masks worn, many people socially distanced, vigilant hand washing, many hug shake hands? Wait til numbers in, covid vs flu.

I know change minds freedumb loving folks. maybe shake fringe switch Biden. given they‚Äôre vaccinating students studying abroad, probably another test efficacy. surprising who? it‚Äôd nice know Coronavirus came from. literally posted whole diatribe you. plucked one word, me. Quit hypocrite, stupid.

I found doctor saying it......you don‚Äôt agree syntax. Lmao.....why else continuing research younger sample sizes? fun? special person Why? makes sense. I‚Äôve seen, every country opens back sees cases rise again. provided exact data this. morons fuck right off. WaPo even quotes researcher saying young 30s affected. Mount-Sinai cooperation medical centers reported 15 years younger already established range 30 - 40.....


But yes, don‚Äôt believe people dieing age, definitely dummy head. big ole, really stupid, dummy head lmao...... houses it‚Äôs lockdown? Answer: It‚Äôs lockdown...it‚Äôs restrictions. several confirmed reinfections, including Reno case USA. That's what's noticed published, would imagine many more. odds getting exactly high random person, immune reinfection certain amount time afterward, odds getting twice relatively short period (only 10 fewer months since spreading places) quite low. Also many cases asymptomatic, especially second time around, see many, many cases reinfection going unnoticed point. *sigh* people permanent... 38% tests they've taken ONE DAY positive

That's still huge number. CDC thinks anything 5% worrysome. $20,000.00 hats made Bear Skin. enforced hard lockdown entire world, 3 weeks? would control shit questions asked. 


Thing everyone moms owe shit capitalism now. social safety net (which, btw, real reason existence governments), means everyone wants keep producing either (employers), greedily want (owners). 


And that's it. We're fucked, poets would say. Side note, think wise idea stand top glass sunroof. shit look MT want see explosive growth. nearly 40 million covid cases worldwide. two people confirmed reinfected, think we‚Äôre fine. OP: ""Considering many surviving 1-25 year olds strokes due lasting conditions giving blood clots, I‚Äôd say need keep reading, ace.""


Me: really?...many kids 1 25 strokes? Man that's messed up...is data that? 

u/FirstoftheNirthStar: "" dummy head ...you stupid ducker...why stupid butt! Mother ducker! even think that! still remind dad buckle I'm car him. We're full grown, intelligent enough adults. say many adults make big fuss putting seatbelt though. like masks anyway. Drinking alcohol prohibited public places. measure due take effect midnight October 14 November 3, government-declared state emergency due end

I'm curious they'll end extending date. tried school lunches teaching kids eat better people lost minds. So.. rise happened due government's responses covid.  true all.

The antibody count body diminish time, body retains ability produce *new* antibodies (using memory B cells) decades, sometimes lifetime even. 

This fear mongering reinfection diminishing antibodies shows fundamental misunderstanding human immunity. People don‚Äôt realize body produce antibodies necessary. said. World Health Organization advocate lockdowns primary means control virus,‚Äù Nabarro told¬†""The Spectator."" Nabarro said lockdowns justified ""to buy time reorganize, regroup, rebalance resources, protect health workers exhausted. large, we‚Äôd rather it.‚Äù

There officially around 1500 deaths Japan. look excess death statistics April-May, 10,000 excess deaths. repeated late summer, maybe around 5,000.

That's pretty bad, compared official positive cases. means really treating anyone corona. bad case, die.

It's Japan. face, protect majority, minority suffers get resources help themselves.

Japan many masks, people use well. let fall nose. use foam masks called ""Pitta"" work well. Japanese really understand corona, use masks mostly social pressure, science duty.

It's masks. social.

So overdispersed virus (only 20% infecting others) can't much harm Japan, socializing low. Everything I‚Äôve seen says it‚Äôs counted positive one time official count.

hmmm.


you find story google news.  hear crud posted F'book. ""You know truck driver ran motorcyclist? Yea, died COVID, right?"" Jerks.

I told every one people April March they're repeating nonsense, excess death counts prove it.

Then posted graph Facebook New Jersey monthly deaths going back 4 demonstrate even remove every single reported COVID death, still breaks prior months record several thousand deaths.

We're underreporting. overreporting.  mean going go away November anyway what's point wearing it. /s problem it‚Äôs almost entirely misinformation. Reliable objective sources far between, least traditional media global government entities. #RIPHumanRace  mortality index bother then. insane jump overall deaths due COVID, something else killing us unprecedented rates.

You‚Äôd almost think they‚Äôd rather know what‚Äôs killing everyone. likely covid make post-viral huge thing 5-10 years many infected many long-haulers. obvious U.S. death toll far higher confirmed numbers course pathetic trolls spreading lies conspiracy theories making fun people wearing facemasks (including certain world leaders) even accept confirmed numbers much less admit they're likely much higher. people (along army sycophantic trolls, pundits political ""leaders"" directly contributed current 213,000 (confirmed) American deaths counting. isn‚Äôt ‚Äúget along‚Äù problem. one side blatantly refusing anything   think is?

Seen pictures people partying China lately?

They 3x population US citizens arent nearly stupid individual individual level.

It might 84000, going exceed states. 

You couldnt cover point lying.

Might 150k deaths average calculated. US 300,000 end year.

By means, continue drinking crap drink Well, goes suggestion.

No. constitution written God immutable. law, like gravity. 

/s  Yup, US government responsibility moment enters borders. Fake news, miasma causes illness 25,000 deaths ok something 40,000 shut world.

Because ""this"" highly contagious unknown prevalence potentially serious complications.

You're also creating straw man beat down, ""shut world."" need ""shut world down"" initial lockdowns happened, needed people take seriously enough wear fucking mask practice common sense outside home. much ask.

It's disingenuous frame argument around idea indefinite shutdown, that's majority argument centered past several months. ironic thing COVID precautions thing enable support economy right now, indicated many financial world also businesses adopting prevention policies stricter cases local governments. actually staggering completely utterly insane nonsensical opposition is, hope willing least consider looking wrong way. chasing argument set sail months ago, living present less destructive measures taken highly effective.

Of course again, we're heading back point lockdowns begin enter conversation precisely people chose nothing. hope understand consider absolutely, maddeningly infuriating. many, yes. getting smarter That‚Äôs CDC said. Wrong pretty egregious. spreading objectively incorrect information, continue peddle ideas pretend right corrected, deliberately spreading misinformation.

Further behavior result ban. also possible additives aid dislodging virus food easily rinsed away water. kill virus, rinse drain. I'm man. thinly veiled anti mask propaganda. It‚Äôs like saying people titanic didn‚Äôt die ship sinking died hypothermia much plans watch solar eclipse Divide. Benzos? Yes is. Ask believes Flu numbers. explain Covid counted way.

Pre-existing conditions people Covid simply irritated pushed edge? Okay, fine. FLU numbers also include people pre-existing conditions flu pushed edge. Cause death determined exact way (would person living infected sickness).

Still 6x higher death toll Covid.  deemed safe three phases clinical trials. market, unlikely problem (but happen). marketed, monitored rare side effects. too. feel like I'm living [Flowers shit. keep hearing constant ""but even know anyone died this?""

I'm lucky enough pretty comfortable position life nearly every death connected natural causes. suppose murders sucides things happen movies? entered people statistics died car crashes on. numbers inflated. labeling people died number means dying Covid simply died, regardless whether actually died it.

At point ""high blood pressure.""

You listen CDC says. Yes specific examples US. warning *all* countries. They‚Äôll say deaths car wrecks violence getting added numbers. It‚Äôs ridiculous. There‚Äôs lot misinformation internet think lot people choose believe want. hate run around spread oooo, sweet one! Yemen far bigger concerns Covid. Sadly. think cults tolerant? surprised this?

Treatment seems help currently use looked outside antivirals antibodies 

Corticosteroids - potent anti-inflammatory action immune suppression

AND

Cetirizine(H1 Antagonist-best known brand Zyrtec)

Famotidine (H2 Antagonist-best known brand Pepcid AC)

Aspirin(to prevent clotting also prostaglandin inhibitor)

What three common target pro inflammatory chemicals synthesized secreted Mast Cells involved immune response. Coincidentally Quercetin, polyphenol flavanoid also recommended treatment protocols. documented mast cell stabilizer, words (probably wrong word choice here) desensitizes cell prevent easier degranulation, release inflammatory compounds. (It also speculated affect viral replication.)

In addition histamine, prostaglandin, mast cells also secrete leukotrienes, cytokines, heparin, etc. 

It seems like treatment protocols target inflammatory compounds benefit dampening inflammatory response bit, preventing inflammatory positive feedback loop seen severe cases. would seem montelukast contribute along lines, course would need researched.

Yeah exactly. overt anti-intellectualism. good graph like national totals? found one ago UK death totals overlapping years, found good visual USA like it. find UK one, I'll link it. Def sharknados. try nuke eye sharknados Look talk cult members, thing. See, agree point keep prisoners safe, disagree point prisoners forced work. serve time. punishment something done. 

Now understand someone smoked joint broken laws hurt another human; forcing work something wrong...but pedophile, murderer, rapist - anything violence/sexual violence hurt another person...they working well serving time death penalty. Western society gone ""justice"" system system ""human rights violent prisoner"". someone use story source saying lockdowns don‚Äôt work. 1 way find Statistical modeling fairly mature science, particularly infectious disease spread. modeled numbers represent high range reasonable confidence interval. People making decisions working best data available -- extrapolated much larger number. shit fight polio? cancer? Malaria? Uighar genocide first reported 2016 (4 years covid). Youre brainwashed one buddy, covering China‚Äôs ass modern Holocaust. Dude don‚Äôt need trust lmao. Trust science plasma therapy widespread Trump got, it‚Äôs common use. Trump got newer, unproven, experimental treatment called ‚Äúmonoclonal antibody cocktail‚Äù operates similar principle little potent. seems worked case.

Also, funny think name sus. I‚Äôve account since 2015 üòâ Also, told ""their team"" believes anything EXCEPT taking seriously. Deny data, deny deaths, herd immunity, whatever. believe real and, even do, herd immunity somehow make us rich.

I'll drink that. Adults positive SARS-CoV-2 test results approximately twice likely reported dining restaurant negative SARS-CoV-2 test results.

Can't wear mask 71% case-patients 74% control-participants reported always using cloth face coverings mask types public

So wearing mask associated covid.

Also, people lie things feel bad admitting mistakes. 2 months ago lol. what's causing current outbreak. grandpa died September due heart attack caused fall. mobility declined greatly due stay home order little reason get move around (his food brought door staff lived). COVID isn‚Äôt cause death heart problems, may lived longer pandemic happened. masks work Still link, understand you‚Äôre admitting you‚Äôre wrong, need keep reiterating point. appropriate time quarantine early February 2020, October 2019. Plenty called measures, many nations enacted measures. Even countries shared land border China done better US thanks enacting quarantines.

The US fact quarantines small number Americans returning Wuhan, never put forth general quarantines international travel. combined poor early testing US prolific community spread. US done early, isolated superspreader events could tracked prevented escalating general community transmission could go daily lives minimal changes. preventing exposure, 50 cases per day isolated areas trackable 50,000 across country not. 6 weeks exponential growth completely changed picture. *the economic lockdowns add many 150 million extreme poor 2021 Congratulations /s sure feel this. Short answer chemo invalidate anyone‚Äôs immune system. Long answer is, seems like really, really bad luck timing all. Interested see sub say.


‚ÄúThe first death reinfection reported Netherlands. patient 89-year-old woman Waldenstr√∂m‚Äôs macroglobulinemia arrived emergency department earlier year suffering fever severe cough. tested positive coronavirus remained hospitalized 5 days, symptoms subsided completely, except persisting fatigue.

Tests antibodies negative days 4 6. condition deteriorated day 8 died two weeks later. Genomic sequencing supports reinfection.‚Äù Yes starvation big one: along delayed diagnoses, suicides, depression, economic destruction. think worrying covid deaths terms quality adjusted life years lost, average ~7 years covid death decades types deaths. Tuberculosis diseases across world also neglected due resource allocation covid well: also think many countries, look excess deaths, see much usual (the US though large almost 10% excess death count year). example, Sweden lockdown basically mask usage less excess deaths year july previous years july: guess seen evidence lockdowns anything delay deaths, seems costs obviously extremely significant. would want see convincing evidence save many hundreds thousands lives implementing them. provided numerous sources latched one word. clear idiocy holding back. Go back school, can‚Äôt work done. less stupid. Lol...two accounts? God's name talking about?

You thrown funny tantrums, name called this. Silly. Covid far ubiquitous contract tracing weak truly determine anyone contracts it. didn‚Äôt social distance, think that‚Äôs got fucked get paid based GDP I'm working extra year life pay government debt. 

It's like bad year barely made money nobody's getting paid back losses also means one pay losses. They're going go national credit card one's ever going pay down.

The good news country's worth 270 trillion dollars absorbing 40 trillion dollars debt end world. could argue automation coming wealth consolidating countries may well debt spend. world moves toward cheaper labor costs automation debt going value used idea ever needs paid probably true.

In words value things life determined cost labor cost labor goes automation value everything ever created goes new lower cost labor since replace everything labor cheaper labor.

So rich people tangible assets like land rebuilt cheaper automated labor see values decline infrastructure that's ever built decline actual value since replaced cheaper ever.

Normally happen cost everything always goes up, significantly lower cost labor cost everything goes including commodities benefit automated mining.

Now course world going automate overnight, we're also going ring 270 trillion debt overnight.

So basically countries borrowed entire net value time automation drives cost labor there's probably reason worry paying debt much higher level worth. Pretty much investments overvalued labor starts drop price. exceptions like automated labor produce surface area Earth real estate still limited buildings really decline value since made cheaper, easier better.

Since Democrats usually ones want big reform fund new ideas think move away concept worrying national debt. would prefer tax corporations run massive deficit, could say borrow money losing opportunity borrow money deflation event automation comes fruition.

If stop think leverage people owe money need pay back may may need pay back based need credit working relationship person owe money.

so go business owe money make demands leverage. go business owe $20,000 make demands much incentive meet demands want $20,000.

So there's something said using debt properly necessarily mean never debt. debt low interest good use probably better going debt opportunity, especially large amounts government debt really practical ever pay off.

We'll lucky get deficit control, we're never paying national debt unless money becomes free. We'll ride debt out, let inflate let automation deflate value actual debt even more.

There's almost doubt that's way going play we're definitely paying eventually robotic automation start negate lot problems lowering cost everything eventually lowering stagnating value things probably lowering since lot times want high volume sales means want low enough profit margins sell product massive global market wildly varying income. people elected office would open minds realize looked study, used skin dead people. Also, may last skin long, much would dead within minutes. Wow would look that. discussing strokes causing deaths actual covid deaths. whole difficulty argument statistics hard find since publish first peer-reviewed article. already said come topic. Alright let trust word random redditor kinda suspect name safe virus is.

And yeah im sure they'll give us treatment trump got. Find geographical location dad been.

I really bad cold pandemic, despite work home, wear mask whenever leave, go outside grocery store. Must caught store's POS system something depends hear from, well personally comprehend data. everybody scientist, vast majority interesting revelations relatively minor findings. normally gets conflated point totally misunderstood flat wrong literally thousands media outlets world reporting disjointed nonsense makes call news.

It's sort thing one year coffee cause cancer, reduce cancer according different study, stories even correct assessment studies they're trying report on.

Everything constant stream clickbait trash mix reality TV thrown in. try best follow stick basic guidelines hoping hell eventually blow vaccine effective widely distributed. intentions pure? stands make even money chaos:  5G nutcases never seemed included mainstream conservative talking points.  (And, whatever reason, see nearly much saw early pandemic)

For example, (yet) seen POTUS retweet 5g conspiracy theory see getting pushed conservative cable news. I‚Äôve 3 friends late thirties early 40s die heart attacks year.  Never one die heart attack before. know it‚Äôs statistically sound, 2 NYC Chicago. Thats simply true. since Reddit overwhelmingly Dem, recycles lot around here. people site agree doesn‚Äôt make fact. say Reps underplay virus much; got pretty damn sick. say Reps ones making false conspiracies ridiculous. whole collusion Russia thoroughly debunked false information completely declassified. created Hillary Clinton organization. welcome look up. also states Obama organization knew it. Biden also recently said you, voter, don‚Äôt deserve know stance packing court. Again, look up. 

This likely get deleted, proving point. much research evidence question. physiological perspective, undergoing active viral replication, amount virus body would huge, adding bit outside world would insignificant. recovery phase, would circulating antibodies, virus would able infect time. one say certain exposure make things worse, risk seems low. Take care welcome! we've spent 16 trillion fighting coronavirus 

No haven't. given away lots money running around like headless chickens. still spend lots money fighting long-term health damages encountering now, like enjoying higher insurance premiums.

And there's lot losses coming people going partying - well, - restaurants cinemas theme parks going bankrupt.

All sum $16 trillion. exactly graph used /r/CoronavirusColorado .  Hospitalization numbers look same. SD nobody gives fuck covid. surprise. Trump signs packed restaurants coughing maskless old people everywhere. ridiculous. Someone start selling Trump branded coffins there, I'm sure they'd plenty business. 8 million cases. Well vaccine reach 300 million cases. Nah, without pandemic lives would expected lost, rate. title quite literally correct. ""For third week row, testing set record high country, average 976,000 tests conducted day last week. percentage tests came back positive virus rose 5.0% 4.6% prior week."" must've missed yesterday came said countries stop using lockdowns primary way control virus... also miss South American countries Argentina Peru longest harshest lockdowns world also worst covid-19 fatality statistics (per capita)? Great Barrington declaration - accredited scientists ""reasonable people"" go narrative conditioned believe??  So, music festival anything death?  mayor anything getting infected dying? It‚Äôs okay they‚Äôre conservatives transmission rate 0% can't really stop it.

Eventually, achieve herd immunity.  One way another.

Either vaccine, via direct exposure.

We slow direct exposure masks, lockdowns, can't stop spread.

There's nobody saying home made masks stop spread.

The home made masks lower chances getting virus. Although zero.

Given enough time, either get virus, vaccine. Completely math, takes 100 million, 200 million, 300 million Americans infected reach herd immunity, what's death toll? study seems focus people gone bars restaurants- don‚Äôt masks fully eating drinking- probably aren‚Äôt socially distancing.  think US even top 10 cases per capita. Israel surprisingly number six. ever maximum? fit agenda.  1. please link quotes reply properly
2. please cite quote reply properly
3. sars low death count many cases far covid killing 6x many people year flu, even counting whatever happens march 1 (when covid deaths US hit one year point)
4. that's true, response involves internet technology anything even 20 years ago. thinks responses past better suppose he's welcome use leaches, incantations, burn bodies streets like used recorded human history people say give FBI Social Security fraud line tell don‚Äôt report might seen accessory. Lying death cause ilegal. Ha! I'll start referring on. Much better ""China virus."" knowing likes name everything, may trademark it. beautiful virus ever! least legal age. improvement amongst clergy. guess that's arrests newspaper reports happened, rather moving different parish cover up... probably read article mate One cousins MD says ground rounds routinely handful patients claim COVID symptoms test comes back positive, suddenly ‚Äúremember‚Äù symptoms ‚Äî took something fever. is. 60 million believed cases lol... guess ~1/5 commenters Covid. Probably since Reddit leans young. Where's 15 people Covid? experiences been? Agree. treated various groups separately. trust scientists. even trust politicians. trust GOP politician ""scientist"" adheres White House talking points. many celebrate even care 5.1 million recoveries reported Worldometers? mean say excess deaths? It‚Äôs good month hamsters! Yeah R definitely down, back march like 3, apparently around 1.2 so. bad. Hopefully. Florida easy pick there. stories baffling - afraid catching covid dying going to...lay die? know fear ration-based, damn. I've long covid almost 7 months, know well anyone bad virus be. can't wrap head around thought process. solid phase 3 data, sure. OK, fair enough. much would cost then?

And still need manufacture, administer catalog 9 million kits. small feat. Shoot back philosophy. Even first hand experience infallible, since people misremember events time, forget hallucinate. dad know anything experiences real? Probably, he'll say sure people confirm experienced actually happened. Everything, even basic sense reality, hypothesis. Yes, one big problems Trump, cronies Fox News... say something true/correct/sane nobody call right there. seen/heard millions sometime later, gets fact-checked, nobody sees/hears that. Like head FDA. made stupid claim two days later, corrected apologized Twitter. Relatively saw that. bam, misinformation people believe true.

Your example repeated time time again, studies, claims, executive orders, etc. Paywall. 

Are dine-in restaurants bars still open? live around types rural people talking about. Never heard say ""it's Liberal conspiracy"". hear talk Democratic Republican Senators stock dumping fucked economy caused panic stock market beginning quarantine. probably know anything though. 

Interestingly, ever hear city people talk this. Hit little close home there? ""Analysis"" literally says ""Higher death toll pandemic"" covid. lockdowns. I've noticed post suggests hint caution gets downvoted. Many posts downvoted, including yours, even extreme. posts containing even information consensus opinion gets downvoted. I've also noticing posts borders conspiracy theories get upvoted well.

I get it. We're tired coronavirus hearing every day. believe things get back normal someday, also believe things going get worse get better going forward, caution taken happens. would even go far say that, whatever reason, hospitals begin getting overwhelmed, lockdowns would justified. virus going away we're sick it.

Anyway, I'm expecting post get mass downvoted. verifiably safe effective vaccine? - Sincerely asking, I've loop past couple days. Climate change majorly caused consumers though. caused big bisiness. Factories spewing air water pollution making surrounding air dangerous breath in.

Correct, I'm sure distinction matter much though. BLM protests ton masks, people handing masks sanitizer updated  updated read Mayor got covid Bonnaro died. doubt many did. üòÇ % deaths age 70? would rather virus get flu symptoms days social distance 2 years that‚Äôs asking go then. explain that, serious trouble. I‚Äôve told simultaneously evidence isn‚Äôt necessary isn‚Äôt enough evidence yet, evidence isn‚Äôt necessary it‚Äôs well-established everyone already knows. cannot true. 

Seems cult-like me. mobilize country's resources one city mobile testing labs well, China possible.

China acts like well oiled machine look hospitals built 2 weeks. friend pretty much exactly politics do. in- we‚Äôve voted last elections. recently took trip Disneyworld ‚Äújust wanted get out!!‚Äù. live west coast. He‚Äôs 26, got coronavirus, brought home, gave roommates. people selfish, non-fact-based response fear, people aren‚Äôt able think critically. think right far people, thoughtless, selfish fools left too. believe difference attributable solely that

why cant be? Im saying is, whats reason that. Great graph. link source used. I‚Äôd love repost it. article says too, like said. know US healthcare system would never lie get penny. really trustworthy honest. That's US healthcare system great.

I'm sure fact Trump Administration hasnt found cases fraud entirely reliable. could anyone gain funneling around CARES act funds?  Headline read: number deaths related lockdowns almost 100k. listen people whose main qualification actors time saying people 70 conditions noted CDC making vulnerable worry? noted, would reckless misinformed. point trying make? seems active part bismuth ion. would nice ranatidine withdrawn us msrket likely others. go, read stop feeling sorry them. repeatedly lied punished doctors spoke trying warn others medical community. angels anyone applauded. Lol k Excellent Health organizations basically sounding like parents saying want send rooms misbehaving people interpreting like ""Hey whatever want! said want send us rooms again!"". plenty evidence - mainly size particles mask filter size virus, burden proof foolish claims like masks reduce transmission 70%. insane - mask-lovers want society locked name ""science"" refuse participate real science zero scientific evidence claims (that even true should't give right make decisions others based fear) depends number tests. also targeted test is. Japan crazy contact tracing, great hygiene practice. *What % deaths age 70?* ‚Äúarmchair‚Äù interest epidemiology word novel respiratory virus China began coming early January US, expected see quick action feds CDC. 

Thus began disillusionment. think able understand much swedish media failed that. 

With logic, Fox News always telling truth they're *journalists*.

Media Sweden large degree responsible what's referred ""√Ösiktskorridoren"" (corridor accepted opinions).

Not falling line expected opinion get publicly shamed, fired work on. survived browser wars saying people 70 conditions noted CDC making vulnerable worry society ignore risk them? noted, would reckless misinformed. covid, focus. felt like thinking mud. would try sudoku puzzle, something enjoy, stare page - nothing would come mind. love read, days make single page. know occasionally blank something someone called? happening constantly. forgot coworker's names address one point.

See? totally empty! pool country's resources single city. mobile testing labs get sent one city test everyone isolate infected. also experience now. republicans endorse him, democrats vocal opposing policies. majority Republican senate, seems like control truck breaks, democratic leaders slamming whole time. imo find internet largely overblown.. see many people talking went smoothly problems. issues? course, think fair say alarmingly high rate problems. course that's subjective, worth know 5 people done different places, people issues several years road. Well disease easily spread keep spreading. brilliant insight.  legit like 15 masks. would never even consider wearing one without washing first. emergency one glove box use since forgot mine run store. stupidly put back glove box. Later, use again, even put face. Mentally, make it. Turned around went home.

Get enough masks get week laundry. hook door office home hang masks. grab one day. He's taking break microchipping us

With bad weather comes sniffles colds. mechanics cold (sniffing, wiping nose, etc) make likely catch Covid? I‚Äôm glad remember me, means lot flu kills every year. Like 6x flu kills every year assuming highest number estimated flu deaths. number almost certainly higher 215k we've got 2.5 mos year add it. Seems reasonable would warrant kind precautions. 3rd leading cause deaths Americans. top two heart disease cancer recommend precautions them. friend mid 20s. Phenomenal health, regular exercise, army reserves takes seriously, got Covid. He's currently fighting pneumonia got afterwards much messed lungs doctors talking full recovery. He's scared right told that's right response. Almost punched someone said hoax, fuck people. Climate change majorly caused consumers though. caused big bisiness.

What ""far stricter measures""? 
If cross check Sweden Norway actual outcome (as people went restaurants, gyms etc), see much difference peak, even less check mobility data. think difference 10 50 people matter event organizers, people would dare go events? Stockholm cities ghost towns peak, seem believe business usual. media good job painting picture.

All Nordic counties quite soft lockdowns, think would better compare countries, rather using Nordics kind proof bad economy. measures propose prevent spread covid include distancing masks?  explain extra deaths year? coincidence ppl dying lot completely unrelated global pandemic shutting planet? (not US) Whats going healthy citizens part- don‚Äôt much issue obesity- also lower incidents diabetes hypertension, hygiene big part culture, basics like wear masks distance lot prevent megaspreader events. cite sources. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Much general consensus crowd legitimate misinformation, like 6% narrative. sub brigaded today deplorables.

Try understand concept, important. pandemic popularity contest. matter many people get ""your side"" agree you. disease control, you, amount down-votes going change that. celebrating totally empty victory. Yep. mean, sure vaccine works sure yet, right? think hope it'll work, chance vaccine this. fact caused wonder would like norm going future. peak, Australia 77K tests one day. use 5:1 pooling, would need double test capacity test Melbourne weekly. That's eminently doable country committed investing infrastructure. China went ~700K tests daily 4.4 million 6 months. get little peeved people assume Canada handing Coronavirus situation well. fuck haven't, Ontario atlwast. shit show we're back stage 2 restrictions bumbling, dumbass premier that's failed prepare immenent second wave. Also type irresponsible twats expect US taking seriously. mean even several, large anti mask protests week. Honestly, aside free healthcare (which I'm grateful for), really much different better US Yeah, one says skipping safety protocol trials. Normal trials take years exactly happens it‚Äôs priority, duration safety happening trial isn‚Äôt affected. tons papers r/science great comments explaining too. They‚Äôre short cutting trials, they‚Äôre prioritizing. Think like car note. Normally it‚Äôs 5 years, forgo bills, pay faster without compromising terms car loan. New Zealand truly zero transmissions trust report outbreak soon tests show positive. heard great things Vietnam also. Shows easy defeat pandemic government people really care. many cases somebody already caught Covid twice? still find one guy Hong Kong. That‚Äôs one argument democracy It‚Äôs special pleading doesn‚Äôt counter said. Perhaps make clearer one seems understand. 

There three parts statement: ‚Äúcontain‚Äù, ‚Äúan endemic virus‚Äù ‚Äúwith basic measures‚Äù. OP suggesting backed science. flat wrong, science could certainly tell us whether would worth cost case.

Containing means something significant sustained 12-18 month pandemic. Globally clearly failed, countries succeeded come enormous cost still far soon say whether maintained, whether cost maintaining worth it. It‚Äôs also enormous risk, reason vaccine ineffective (fortunately seems unlikely).

Secondly, examples I‚Äôm given places like South Korea, New Zealand, Vietnam, closed borders almost immediately never allowed virus become widespread population. Congratulations them, clearly applicable 95% countries failed beginning faced sustained dispersed transmission many months. Suggesting could turn back clock try harder absurd. explained comment example China isn‚Äôt applicable non-authoritarian state, I‚Äôd gladly take many pandemics exchange freedom enjoy democracy.

And finally, idea need ‚Äúbasic measures‚Äù political/public solve it. People hate restrictions daily life, every passing day economic pain restrictions becomes real, especially developing world. That‚Äôs say nothing spiritual social loss suspension nearly cultural activities social rituals. It‚Äôs delusional think people won‚Äôt push back that, every right to. massive sacrifices opinion worth extending lives 80 year olds six months, however tragic might be.

The reason I‚Äôm passionate people genuinely believing anywhere could stop tried hard enough creates idea so, complicit responsible deaths. ignorant sentiment creates toxic atmosphere times already hard people suffering. don‚Äôt think adds anything discussion. Sorry loss. Manchester united times... Manchester United right here. Ramming vaccine process one companies support Trump, without thorough testing/analysis bragging rights election exactly par Trump administration's past behavior. Honestly, seems guaranteed me, given utter fucking disregard anyone else's safety, laws, best practices... stuffing positions administration people whatever Trump says. don‚Äôt talk neighbor, easy peasy. [archive link anyone trouble accessing article Unfortunately we‚Äôre left trying come marketing like stories get people adopt evidence. Unfortunately people opposing evidence much better marketing. 

Also understatement year! can't expect one solution work everyone. That's point good governance all. case, even valid vaccine end everything. distribute fair efficient, make sure enough people get vaccined reach herd immunity might even bigger challenge developing it.  Lol Godwin‚Äôs law amazing lmao. said anything degrading? expressing pity.

Everybodies opinion matter opinion spreading disinformation.

Try thinking talking next time comment. might actually say something somebody would care about. backwards, thought 20/10 50% vision 20/20, actually 20/40 need (still nowhere close). I'll probably get shit rest reddit acount's life, I'm looking trying become law enforcement. Ok calm dude. Everyone knows US healthcare industry moneymaking scam. course hospitals going get paid providing service. point question along lines patient came say stomach ache died appendicitis would benefit doctor marking ""covid related"" specific covid tag grant anything extra compensation wise would already getting non covid related conditions. 

And links sources others posted may money medical billing done packages seem include common tests procedures much different billing practices real evidence say cases/deaths artificially inflated. There's nice website providing stats death toll lag.
Last month [3,500 old registered day, government made checks changes reporting system. Probably time tell real pandemic numbers plenty non-island nations better

Better cases...? Nothing Coronavirus response easy hard things do, comparatively least hard. Australia's currently testing half peak capacity there's slack system surveillance testing even without adding machines/workers. Yep go ahead shoot virus, that‚Äôll definitely work /s people responsible stupidity? really help it? what?????

countries counting deaths differently fine, dont compare countries using them. that's fine, sound advice. ""Make decisions based much miss seeing someone's face."" not. Here‚Äôs thing, actual chances catching grocery store people masked don‚Äôt hug anyone 10+ min chat freezer section?

The counter argument always ‚Äúvulnerable people leave home too!‚Äù true, one population strictly going necessities free pursue social activities, etc. Hey, regardless ad hominem attacks person launched you, regardless insane anti-mask anti-preventative measure stances, they‚Äôre wrong. 

You‚Äôre posting info March. It‚Äôs believed impacted areas, true number cases range 2x 10x reported count. 15% needing hospitalization March means maybe 7% low 1.5% needing hospitalization now. 

Keep mind back envelope, shitty math hard numbers different. say 15% cases require hospitalization would still mean cities like Los Angeles would overrun would actually see bodies streets. ice trucks cart dead elderly, mean actual people able walk doors hospitals they‚Äôre crowded dying street doctor sees them.  Maybe shouldn‚Äôt mentioned pictures, he‚Äôs respectful decent human being. hand getting upset won‚Äôt send potentially graphic pictures really bad accident. anyone comes weird it‚Äôs you. makes lot sense. thanks advice Immune** Neither I. autoimmune disease compromised immune system. 


But fuck me, right? US invaded Iraq patriotic fervor result 9/11. Therefore, 9/11 death toll higher 3,000 since encompasses Iraq war deaths well. 

This difference deaths caused event deaths caused government response event Large crowds thought facilitate spread corona virus. I‚Äôd say positivity rate consistently rises. blip past couple weeks due clusters, overall positivity maintaining around 1%.

I know lot unhappy people NYC due precautions restrictions still place, know what, like feeling safe overwhelmed tons anxiety hearing another 800 people state died 24 hour span virus prevent spread giving fuck fellow human being. 

I hope keep avoid dreaded true 2nd wave long possible. Indeed. Religion treated women terribly, whether Judaism Buddhism. Oh my. Mayor Manchester. Home Bonaroo. Wonderful, make accessible average American treatment. told exactly case. Read articles. subset people far angry I'm blocking door, kill need prove wrong. Afterwards others reflect happened day. many people need ""prove it"" to, save rest now?

The problem analogy ZERO see fighting get door actually interest contracting COVID today.

To them, abstract commitment months now. Never, today tomorrow next week, though.

Also, told ""their team"" believes anything EXCEPT taking seriously. Deny data, deny deaths, herd immunity, whatever. believe real and, even do, herd immunity somehow make us rich.  spread virus symptoms also completely asymptomatic. Safe: Probably, they've giving emergency use many months hundreds thousands people received via combo double blind trials emergency use reported serious side effects (this something China cover since foreign HCW ones responsible administering monitoring trials.)

Effective: Unknown. far know, none Phase 3 candidates revealed publicly effectiveness Phase 3 trials yet. sad. Literally one asked ""give life"". Unfortunately, care health take every measure catch pandemic worthy virus. really hard average person wear mask sanitize hands touch face. 

For must near exposed people - like - take every preventative measure. Covid patient coming in? I'm grabbing CAPR I'm part team. 

It's 100% government yes sooner stimulus packages hurt. think logic weren‚Äôt responsible hardships life previously, responsible hardships now? It‚Äôs hand fate dealt you, shouldn‚Äôt problem.

(Of course reasoning would change flash circumstances reversed.) seems feasible way.
Considering potential viruses, Covid19 lower end spectrum. Politicians intelligent enough understand this.

So must contained front-line workers, becomes large enough matter political action. has. personally would TRY get know long term affects chance (albeit small most) bad outcomes. guess I'm fan tempting fate. worry much though position would probably take reasonable precautions. Yeah, Imgr weird, click photo see high rez image.

Basically blue lines go way across years past.

The dotted lines data it‚Äôs updated week. cdc retroactively updates week data comes in, death count week 15 different data presented week 15 compared current data week 39.

The dotted lines continue dip week due lag reporting, look closely see, example, week 21, bright green dotted line, ends almost 15k deaths week, one week later, looking week 22 data see added almost 30k deaths retroactively one week.

You look latest line (week 39) get good indicator. Typically ignore last three weeks data, lag reporting noticeable. show people understand data constantly updated show trends reporting.

If look second graph, that‚Äôs gets interesting, slope line appears diverging norm previous years, initial jump excess deaths, line trending show continued increase data keeps coming (i.e. could see excess deaths increase even next weeks/months).

Hope helps. ""sad"" ? Humorous typo? Hey you‚Äôre free debate me. :) lol good example using masks home, yellin rocks

Last night reading papal representative speaking Cardinal Wolsey matter Henry VIII's possible annulment marriage said ""like yelling rocks"" noted vivid expression was.

Then I'm reddit 10 minutes bam. No, making fallacious argument.  plenty non-island nations well, better, yes NZ get lot attention western nation. doesn‚Äôt take away success. Disappointed COVID perspective surprised, point. There's almost protest something every week two weeks LA point, number cracking /this/ protest rather /that/ protest would go poorly official would attempt it. Yeah. Pandemics going regular occurrence around world. Hence, masks social distancing going regular occurrence around world. ok exposing people getting sick dying well? civilized ones. world power that‚Äôs going huge problem everyone road. Geez. guess world really unlucky Covid19 hit time lots people mysteriously died unknown reasons. K everybody Reddit says 2 week hard lockdown thing erradicate virus Maybe inform posting nonsense internet. bring Japan? 

I'm curious, Japan 1628 deaths population 126M, [despite aging population, uninterrupted use mass transportation, dense cities, formal yet, [seroprevalence tests suggest Tokyo already herd think mix masking culture silence. know people talking produce 10 times many infectious droplets people silent, Japan dense strong cultural taboo loud talking public, tightly packed trains dead silent. seems cultures favor loud talking, like Italy, Spain Latin America, faster rates spread. 

There also evidence masks reduce symptom severity even failed prevent infection. could explain cases deaths.
 believe mask adoption rate Japan high.  think BLM much better cause shit like disgusting, pathetic species. truth early action, specifically quarantines international travel contact tracing, best solutions pandemic. never gets stage community transmission, vast majority damage prevented.

Lockdowns stop-gap measure. prevent cascade failure healthcare system 100% capacity reached, give time produce PPE, done early completely give shot returning pre-community transmission stages. definitely preferable avoid situation requires even benefits lockdown.

The US particularly badly hit incomplete lockdown, never implemented form quarantine completely ineffective testing critical stages. Thus virus spread throughout country even slightest measures taken. wildly sown seeds, little could done beyond preventing total failure medical system, effort successful. prevented run-away scenario little else. can't go forever. Besides, one cared flu past, suddenly corona problem even know mortality ridiculously low. one benefitting closing West China. gotta corona idea far vaccine there's still fact killed 5-6x amount flu does. deadly virus we're dealing with. Yeah better understating risk. pretty big milestone. pandemic isn‚Äôt new young. general data determine needs priority social safety nets, needs staying home needs taking extra precautions. rest us allowed determine comforts public. work service I‚Äôm comfortable job interacting public. would rather job next year, thank you. grandma wants come eat lunch here, she‚Äôs done evaluation. university's strategy Georgia too.  noted, can't take seriously.

One would believe Norwegians participating vast conspiracy suppress data. absurd.  Attempting degrade someone opinion valid response opinion. Try unique thought next time. One thing lying things control now. Introverts made times. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt go out.‚Äù ‚ÄúK, cool, prob‚Äù ^ill informed argument. good. arrest fucking idiots causing strokes. See comments link Mayo Clinic Hackensack Medical. Wow! Thank you! seriously amazing resource family! slightest goal mock anyone. year challenging everyone lot people fears normal reaction. thing scared person looking someone cheer up, conversely one spews negativity others talks bullshit like world won‚Äôt go back normal. 

Let tell world gone harder challenges corona pandemic like World War II spanish flu able recuperate fine after. Go talk 100 year old WWII survivor blessed chance future ask attitude hard times WWII. 

I guarantee wouldn‚Äôt amongst us fatality attitude like do, life survive also inspired others fight lives. opposite would crumble negative emotions take people you. fail control disease, takes even longer. Unless think 1/3 population elevated risk dying going throw caution wind. Deplorable deplorable does. Tennessee mayor? state governor mayor? Delaying, buying time exactly need right now. Fact fact, China's lock worked, much back normal much less death count. Great question! know true answer much would cost. assume would likely cost whole lot less COVID-19 hotspot flared shut entire city. That's something would cost-benefit analysis determine.

Agreed. 9 million kits lot. Although, took COVID test, basically glorified Q-tip sealed test tube, sanitized. worked scientist, know pack like, 1000 test tubes maybe $50. pack 1000 cotton-tipped swabs even cheaper. US prices. assume China mandated scientific manufacturers focus making excess swab-tubes (or, called swoobs lol). manufacturing job, materials labor make 9 million kits likely expensive.

I think biggest expense administering test. know took test, self-administered car, drive-thru CVS, allowing non-doctors/-nurses get testing done. surprised temp people hired oversee administration tests China.

Yeah, like said, small feat. culture focused whole society rather individualism, allowing better compliance testing. authoritarian gov't, allowing rapid responses like this. Florida lost greater percent long term care residents New York did. lol u sure? White House knew going spike control. It‚Äôs forced hospitals send data firstly instead CDC. Different things entirely, r/nonewnormal poorly named anti-mask sub. original Ace...but provide data many 1-25 year olds strokes. shit. hit US early October start counting deaths when? February? March?

""Pneumonia"" deaths 500% extended metro area autumn winter. 

Also deaths stroke, aneurysm, heart inflammation huge increases. Covid causes things. test bodies Covid.

Also people share symptoms physicians told wait home quarantining. die home gets worse get hospital always counted COVID death. That's wait it. Yep. probably 200k months ago may work like think comment meant vaccine may give partial protection decrease severity symptoms. Hopefully 100% protective though fair, people definitely using arguing point we're met cries fake news. let's say isolate old people. take care them? isolate home workers too? Okay protect considering likely kids. isolate kids too? Okay educate kids? isolate teachers? Force kids doctors nurses care home workers learn remotely? draw firebreak? big make bubble? pay it? Barrington guys supported big business know want pay dime implementing this.

Maybe make kids people interact wear masks.

Oh wait back currently have. 

Hard short lockdowns work. worked NZ. worked China. work AU. US mAh Feedum. 

The problem lock risk, effectively quarantining people based risk far far higher number ( 50 million citizens 65 ) simply locking test positive ( 50k day ). 

If tell people test positive stay home two weeks pay them, forcibly intern would actually lot.

So whole lock risk non sense. understand many old people us?  Average death, maybe. killed 80K+ 75 U.S. 6% thing disinformation campaign. comorbidities things resulted virus like respiratory failure. 6% failed complete death certificate completely noted COVID19. they're idiots really infuriating education educators treated like shit constantly defunded country government americans act shock kids arent well academically education disgrace. total fucking horseshit. Ya'll need either unionize, unionized, kick leadership out. kind thing affects us allow continue. makes sick stomach think people I've known, I'll never know, who've dedicated thier lives field thrown wolves. Including indirect effects layoffs, doctor avoidance, etc. problematic dishonest. effects measures taken avoid virus measured separately effects virus itself; otherwise there's way understand risks benefits virus responses. Ditto  got source that? really understand one. governments world hurt economies tens thousands people die hate trump? they‚Äôre going normal trials. warp speed comes many researchers drop they‚Äôre switch covid research. They‚Äôre short cutting safety trials. make lockdown ? /s find really interesting, food allergy pine nuts. anaphylactic shock type, eat pine nuts...they taste like metal. ‚ÄúVirus fatigue‚Äù diagnosed mental illness, wanting wear masks distance get locked mental hospital shown proper empathy acceptance life won‚Äôt go back normal instance, health authorities [blatantly told people wear masks early on. Well, hunger make people overeat, become obese, susceptible Coronavirus. I'd guess obesity alone, including poor diet eating habits, kills 100k per year. hate needles tattoos **So flu 2019.** (Also, wars big country stepping-in conflicts small countries).

Wars also kill strong young soldiers, women, children, men, etc, whereas COVID kills vastly mostly senior citizens. 

Garbage post No, better cure. makes dont get first place. too. asthma, *and* obese. wear mask walk two miles 90f, tolerate 20 minutes buy ever important foot long. Except we‚Äôre talking planes crashing... nice try tho. probably happen. debt accrued course pandemic probably never paid back.

The effects stimulus fully realized normalcy returns. across europe, specifically dutch thing. (other countries might too, dont know, spread one big line across countries)  going memory, covid raise risk still birth own?  I‚Äôm iffy vaccine. crazy thoughts like autism microchips, think they‚Äôre going cut FDA corners claim victory. Add absolutely way medium term study, let alone long term study, gets iffy. Also people first wave appear already getting virus again. told, you‚Äôre high risk, might worth it. Otherwise vaccine might great idea take right release. (This year's deaths) - (historical average deaths) = (Deaths attributable Covid)

You can't argue subtraction. understand I‚Äôm 16. It‚Äôs literally part syllabus Yeah see sk better job eg. gps tracking self quarantine would supposed meaningful life then? Go on... Lol, want get coughed mouth breathing fucklican show tinder date manly walk Walmart without mask open carry hip. Fuck jagaloon, adults talking.  There's 18 yr old kid respirator fighting life right (actually idk he's since Friday) hospital near me. typical teenager known health issues. shit like playing Russian Roulette wanna play. Ultra-Orthodox Brooklyn Jews cult. cult represent Orthodox Jews Jews. Cults picture intolerance. IHME estimates 25% COVID infections detected US, much lower August, probably 40 million cumulative cases. That's able spread well. 

Ebola, far know, stealth contagion effect. Leave house man. make sure lock get symptoms. No, it‚Äôs not. Don‚Äôt baby. Trump illness thing sign might go away election. There's couple frequent users believe genuinely overwhelmed things want normal life return, there's squad downplayers. obvious. Imagine happening pandemic. Deaths going also. Since determine pandemic based positive cases deaths? coulda told smh.. people soooo daft ""technically might right"" but, else explain virus related deaths?

That's kept saying...

Always pandering, I'd tell them, ""If COVID-19 hoax, Trump completely unexplained mystery wreaking havoc upon New Jersey. even right, argument exist incriminates ten times worse admitting virus.""

Then, course, they'll pretend I'm one listening. crap every time. I've even challenged apply amazingly predictive conspiracy theory insights help us make millions prediction markets like PredictIt.

If there's one thing learned getting Finance degree, degree stronger predictive power future events made immensely profitable. Oh worry, flu back next season. close persons business can't make money - lock down. You‚Äôre gonna need bigger coat. problem Covid America we're bunch fat, old, asthmatic fucks; odds good got co-morbidity. point is, obvious investigation certainly happen, going crisis. common sense people. quotes, I‚Äôd like post mortem outbreak get together,‚Äù go Media briefings early on, find spoke plenty right time investigation. crisis. watched plenty them, remember exactly ones. work city state (in similar work conditions comparable city employees) produce something helps society, makes something reduce likelihood ppl going life crime, think fair. (making desks/chairs schools, teaching utensils, school utensils, making textbooks, etc). 

working private corporations save labor costs sounds wrong.

i know CA prisons use prisoner labor process recycling material eventually feed private recyling/waste disposal firms. idk feel abt that. Sometimes also incognito window  guess always ask know someone personally affected riots? That‚Äôs take seriously. Meanwhile FL, TX, MO, ND, SD, WI, etc. Source Family member lives Harbin. BTW lock-down mean forced home certain business force closed travel stopped. 


In Melbourne, AUS lockdown 5km radius travel limit, compulsory masks, schools, work home order, visitors homes, 8mp curfew.  really feel bad situation going upvote. guy, Macron, worse super spreader Trump. True, smart people get vaccine get sick. Dumb people skip vaccine, get sick, understand can't take vaccine cure got Covid19.  seems totally insane!

I understand anybody ability think critically totally dismiss data science behind masks distancing. logical me.

I know enough know complex well understood impacts people differently. seems many ""a friend"" fine, means overblown bad flu. clothes can‚Äôt stop bullet might well stop wearing all. feel way. Wtf this. Yep. Maybe people stop saying healthy weight. That's true. never have. isn‚Äôt new. live US, lockdown NY. restrictions doesn‚Äôt mean lockdown. add extra.dot behind one get 10 dollar gift card subway Sadly think not. recommendations reduce spread influenza covid. difference people actually following year. Next flu season covid gone-ish, expect people disregard flu again. Um no. contracts already signed preproduction started. trump balls halt delivery 25th admen him. And, honestly, think citizens would strike, would break. 

I know he's pos, beat racist ass beat covid worse things death. still learning fucked disease leaves people ""recover."" get control order save jobs. Cause last way things are. Amazing. totally different reaction. China going isolated country going ahead... least world largely vaccinated going convince anti mask people. Death disparity easily attributed factors surrounding lockdown instead direct result COVID. fun thing statistics interpret anything way want people anti mask find stats support point call day even means ignoring everything else. never have. isn‚Äôt new. live US, lockdown NY. restrictions doesn‚Äôt mean lockdown. 200,000 deaths.

*I bot, action performed automatically.

I'm saying downplaying virus wrong, stop, might improve people's response. What's wrong that? epidemiologists saying life go back 'normal' shouldn't. We've seen mask wearing sick leave also massively reduce flu infections death makes sense moving forward encourage mask wearing cold season offer sick leave prevent work spread.

Also take long time vaccinate everyone, vaccines might offer firebreak style herd immunity primary form immunity cell mediated, know long immunity lasts infection vaccine.

We're gonna need cautious. shot probably eatting restaurant sage again. 

There gonna magical VC ( Victory Covid ) day. Probably least two years. Things slowly get normal never see 2018 normalcy perhaps we. gotta potty mouth. parents get news Fox News told don‚Äôt believe 200k people died hospitals get extra $10k record death COVID rather actual cause. mention absolutely terrifying post-Covid side effect NYT covered today (brain $35,000 it. Yikes. Considering many surviving 1-25 year olds strokes due lasting conditions giving blood clots, I‚Äôd say need keep reading, ace. don‚Äôt consider highly virulent. every person like probably won‚Äôt die, could easily spread someone couldn‚Äôt lucky. spread someone spreads someone could die, forth.

There lot changes county level liquor laws since Tennessee state allowed wine grocery stores 2013. doubt dry one time though. 1-25 year olds.

*1-25 year olds.*

**1-25 year olds.**

ONE TWENTY-FIVE YEAR OLDS.

How many fucking times reiterate age range?? going ignore forever continue feel right? entire pointless comment chain started someone said didn‚Äôt feel like danger 20s. countered ‚Äúmany 1-25 year olds strokes‚Äù.

THERE ONE AGE RANGE TABLE. ""272 people confirmed dead among 4,200 new cases Monday."" someone explain point test? Detecting disappearing antibodies? personally know two elderly people passed covid tineframe likely covid. never counted covid deaths tested. way really control pandemic hide truth public. way, people going get colds get week so, elderly die died preexisting conditions instead virus caused immediate demise. ""It would take week's worth telling none"" Prohibition worked great, didn‚Äôt it? think it‚Äôs ok. want come contact humans realistically half year thing. need level face face human interaction stay sane. **Neglecting socialization mental health bad, worse, Covid.**

Are reading comment? He's saying important issue consider socialization even may get covid. right there. case, Chinese scientists would need take time machine back dec 2019 tell china characteristic particular nuevo corona virus, probably give DNA sequence too. anti-mark activists. terrorists. want people die taking active steps prevent safety induce deaths.

A $1,000 fine laughable. Jail time appropriate. No, isn‚Äôt. People really reactionary upvote you.  high Sounds like I'm date. went first 4 Bonnaroo fests dry then, back since 2005. is. clearly don‚Äôt know difference cfr ifr.

In general can‚Äôt refute argument saying ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt factual basis‚Äù, actually argue it. you‚Äôve done nothing sort. don‚Äôt knowledge, admit don‚Äôt answers move on. Otherwise you‚Äôre wasting time. dictatorship, that's what's going here. know protestors wearing masks, correct?

Im aware 100% wore masks yes, would crazy considering many protesters wearing masks effective everyone it?

Nah, theyre effective people use them. nothing type situation. reason didn‚Äôt reportedly spread drastically protests outdoors (**also current theory covid transmissions protests riots offset lack transmissions people staying home avoid protests riots**). 

Thats interesting opinion! Got sources back up? whether COVID spread protests point.

Well yeah point killed it. Remember typed this?

**It‚Äôs Republicans encouraging protesting streets social distancing past 4 months straight?**

You cant lie history one scroll Democrats room talk ‚Äútaking seriously‚Äù downplayed promote mass outdoor gatherings previously condemned Republicans it. It‚Äôs hypocrisy. 

Democrats plenty room talk Republicans COVID actually. Pay attention. Trump responsible 25% global covid deaths even though 4% global population. Faaaaaaaaaailure. strawman? everyone U.S. stop working? cohort included 43 men (67%) 21 women (33%); median age 66 (range 20‚Äì92) years. Thirty-six (56%) brain MRIs considered abnormal, possibly related severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus.

""Possibly."" Worrisome, definitive, yet. Stop setting best pricks can‚Äôt wait crap over, introvert okay first several months I‚Äôm antsy. I‚Äôll follow restrictions long needed, course, I‚Äôm freaking tired it. think good news. sacrificed much NYC well (after disastrous spring). people can't responsible/considerate neighbors, I'm city state imposing focused restrictions fines. can't go back April/May.  wonder number reported cases good metric two months ago, can't trusted? Damn someone generally hates around doctors hospitals also concern mine. I've hesitant get flu shot want around medical people chance getting secondhand. bought bottle whiskey Manchester. Log Cabin Maple whiskey right major brands rolled theirs. woman George Dickel distillery recommended friend me. virus clearly widespread Japan. Maybe virus kill many Japanese Asians due genetic factors. Strange article mention Kawasaki disease, essentially is, affects 100 children LA county year. virus lead syndrome, body's reaction causes it. That‚Äôs lowest traffic fatality rate US. Doesn‚Äôt matter aggressively drive can‚Äôt get 40mph... think we‚Äôre parsing words ‚ÄúsTraWwmAn!‚Äù still know that's better Literally OP said. figured virus far less deadly previously thought,

This exactly true. Febuary/March estimated 3.3 Case Fatality Ratio based China's experience. Looking back pretty accurate. Experts quickly realized significant # asymptomatic/mild cases caught Infection Fatality Ratio much lower CFR. saw many projections revised .5-1%, time gone I've seen .6% numbers. Skewed heavily towards elderly. death rate continue decline doctors get better medication treating, improving outcomes, younger people become infected. Still, mortality rate .5% kill unfathomable amount people disease infectious COVID. Nah Tullahoma liquor drink back 2012 definitely jumbo margarita one restaurants town. never know truth never happened U.S. need rely strawmen, obvious stupidity argument becomes. ban bars (and pubs) together, spread diseases sell substances make people dumber, place modern society. Penetration vatican never good thing... don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs bad idea door open. I‚Äôd distance wear masks, shared food drinks. could also consider, weather space permits, using large canopy style tent outside sit rain. ""The article suggests death toll ~~of~~ *during* pandemic is...""

Much accurate.  bought body positivity fat acceptance movement like America has. fat people say face. worth commenting on. There‚Äôs new community infections 16 days. community cases recovered. new infections imported cases, meaning caught outside country brought back. new returnees put managed isolation 14 days tested. country don‚Äôt tend count ones. It‚Äôs community ones worry about.  ironic since dry county. Gotta roll Murfreesboro actually get drink.  Actually would speed pandemic lol would personally try distance wear mask (until he‚Äôs quarantine) can‚Äôt stay separate rooms.  ""Unincorporated farm land"" quite helpful town directly next drive through.  never made argument. asked read article. reports hospitals putting patients hospitals put hallways that's kind brainer Good question asking since March. Successful elimination countries deserve much recognition coverage media. Perhaps that‚Äôs tad realistic expecting *everyone* stop working stay home? That‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening am. Lol dumb you?

CARDIAC ARREST COMORBIDITY.

Read article stop making retarded f people convinced logic reason liar, concrete evidence never appease them. less logic reason use get position, less logic reason works get out. place always reputation party place
Other Austrian resorts far better
Not surprisingly I've always avoided place. change fact free time dictated someone else. 

The fuck life then? Work, sleep, work, sleep, fun allowed? Fuck that. Wow , cant believe ppl blind brain washed. don‚Äôt simply search ‚Äúwuhan‚Äù YouTube Also check 2020‚Äôs worlds box office ranking. might figure something lol   please ban r/CoronavirusCirclejerk losers? anti-science skeptics trying start circlejerks largely succeeding due lack moderation. mention one first things administrations block nursing homes ban visitors them. clearly shown work enough community spread outside isolated areas. Oddly, ""protect vulnerable"" turned coded way saying exact opposite.  another take ""Barrington Declaration"", blah blah herd immunity. enforcing it? World Health Organization long favored interventions come less economic social disruption lockdowns, recommending governments pursue strategy called ‚Äútest, trace, isolate,‚Äù sequestering people exposed virus. **Western governments found tests enough contact-tracing staff follow plan action.** Hell yeah is. can't drink carry Fuck loved ones important asshole general living military base filling paperwork day. Dealing initial outbreak without ever really getting handle it. NZ gets praise bc sub extremely left leaning identity politics. They'll dress something else that's major, major reason.

But yes, citizens great job cannot discounted. 83-year old Pope Francis, lost part one lung illness young man, drawn sharp criticism social media wearing mask Wednesday general audience, held last week indoors. seen shaking hands clerics otherwise mingling masked crowd. bodyguards similarly maskless. true though. + somewhat concerned remained 60+% population   children hilarious.  well, peer reviewed, title uses words like ""could"".

So, ""facts"" call them, solid.

At point, yeah, panic porn. inhale four step, exhale four step Probably can‚Äôt afford daycare either. gotta change shit kids, fam. Best luck y‚Äôall. Stay safe, player. longest? Don‚Äôt forget China‚Äôs death toll C19SurvRate.jpg‚¨á

TOTAL U.S. DEATHS [ALL CAUSES]:
2017 Total Deaths US: 2,813,503 Total Deaths US: 2,839,205 Total Deaths US: 2,855,000 Total Deaths US (jan - week 9/26): 2,130,000 + (236,000/month x 3) [Oct, Nov, Dec] = 2,838,000 [assumption based monthly avg]
2020: 2,838,000 [3-month assumption insert]
2019: 2,855,000
2018: 2,839,000
2017: 2,814,000 Yeah, pretty hard deal with. worst part even feel sympathy. There's fucking pandemic chose deny/blow off. time, hate go COVID. 

Some pretty strong mixed emotions. ""Excess deaths include COVID deaths"" people know range 70-22. (Parents friends sick). Surprisingly, father asymptotic tested positive antibodies only. Everyone else sore throat/cough several days. worst case friend late thirties low grade fever, cough sore throat month. wondering fuck boy agenda would show pandemic work? study? Imagine told work peak capacity. barely sleep, health suffer little, short time end get it. 

Now imagine told work double peak capacity. Twice actually capable pushed limit. think could it?

You could argue add people machines could double peak capacity. sounds fine theory, practice things work way. machines necessarily easy obtain, similarly enough suitably skilled experienced people available either. scale processes able handle twice work, sounds simple say reality bit organisational nightmare.

In experience getting twice manpower equipment necessarily mean twice capacity. fact almost never does. know anything medical testing, works like industry I'm fairly sure would easier said done. know protestors wearing masks, correct? wearing masks effective everyone it? reason didn‚Äôt reportedly spread drastically protests outdoors (also current theory covid transmissions protests riots offset lack transmissions people staying home avoid protests riots). 

And whether COVID spread protests point. It‚Äôs Democrats room talk ‚Äútaking seriously‚Äù downplayed promote mass outdoor gatherings previously condemned Republicans it. It‚Äôs hypocrisy. 

Lmao we‚Äôre gonna ‚Äúover covid‚Äù there‚Äôs vaccine, even it‚Äôll probably turn another flu vaccine we‚Äôll get every year. reworded conveniently left part clearly states ""Excess deaths include COVID deaths."" Yeah, people need eat well. hard lockdown phase worked factories work home hit really hard financially. Despite decree stating owners could kick tenants pay rent, owners anyway, therefore amount homeless people increased. We're economic dumpster fire, people began ignore lockdown months ago make ends meet. impossible. Adding cases people allowed see dying loved ones (not covid cases, cancer such) came province, despite special permit so. also lot people celebrating birthdays etc apparently celebrating simple birthday unacceptable some. rise cases unavoidable, lockdown temporary stopper, people needed begin working point. *trust government. Yay Zoom socializing. Can't wait. Guess what? people want get back normal life

They sure aren‚Äôt acting like it. keep things make pandemic last longer.  Astute observation, that. what's % false negative rate test? multiply risk person person transmission ""friend"" multiply risk person person transmission ""friend"" you. give idea risk infection.

not perfect, know, least within ball park  people read ""Free IceCream Noon""... Yeah. read actual study see times things brought versus excess deaths potentially missed.

""As noted earlier, excess deaths assigned Covid-19 could include deaths involving Covid19 misclassified causes death deaths indirectly related Covid-19 pandemic. NCHS made effort examine excess deaths assigned Covid-19 cause death. September 24, 2020, NCHS attributed 28,797 excess deaths Alzheimer‚Äôs disease related dementias, 16,040 excess deaths hypertensive diseases, 11,222 excess deaths ischemic heart disease, 10,285 excess deaths diabetes, 3,056 excess deaths influenza pneumonia.29 estimates suggest majority excess deaths identified study likely assigned Alzheimer‚Äôs disease related dementias various circulatory diseases diabetes. possible substantial fraction deaths individuals pre-existing chronic conditions acquire Covid-19 die result ascribed pre-existing condition. may constitute many excess deaths attributed Covid-19.""

And again, states tended least restrictive measures opened first highest frequency excess deaths attributed COVID. 

""The frequency excess deaths not

Perhaps consider ancestors handled plagues disease. vast minority country. protected. involves personal responsibility like deciding stay home. country wide mandates perfectly health people boyfriend‚Äôs coworker‚Äôs daughter tested positive, made decision get tested means I‚Äôm allowed go back work 2 weeks. I‚Äôm second-guessing decision 2 weeks without pay going cripple financially months, time work busy mall would rather safe sorry. degree separation positive case, really don‚Äôt know necessary, especially taking extra heightened precautions since boyfriend‚Äôs parents live us mother severely immunocompromised.

Any thoughts? wanted lie would report tiny number like 12? could swept rug said nothing; fact even making Western media suggests probably made up. Regardless ‚Äúside‚Äù you‚Äôre on, one thing completely clear. virus ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt bad,‚Äù wouldn‚Äôt posting right now. Governments planet wouldn‚Äôt locked down, scientific community wouldn‚Äôt racing towards vaccine, daily lives wouldn‚Äôt altered affected way.

The fact everything we‚Äôve gone happen, still happening, indisputable proof threat greater anything we‚Äôve faced either life times parents life times.

Any attempt downplay threat flies face truth evidence see two eyes. attempt encourage infection seek herd immunity going cause untold suffering grief death. 

Do you‚Äôve got do, protect family. Stay home, wear mask, wash hands. Agree. Even though doesnt say it, leads believe two connected. Yeah I‚Äôm questioning now. top ‚Äúdeplorable‚Äù stuff.  Attempting censor information draws attention information censored. People interested see there's something big corps want hide, actively seek whereas would ignoring it. saw comments. trying take one part article context ignoring fact clearly states ""Excess deaths include COVID deaths.""
And upset Trump held responsible spreading lies, conspiracy theories claiming wearing facemasks un-American. hurts feelings Trump called shit tell stop full it. I'll socialize private however want. Thanks. would. family immunocompromised. Yet life go on. There's nothing left protect let economy crash. Like said, willing quarantine flu outbreaks. suddenly even healthy adults need it. I'm taking chances corona rather sit home unemployed. I'm willing sacrifice career youth flu. Lol look guy shunning like Dwight fucking Schrute! 

Sorry man, think opinions already swayed (not favor) yes, almost certainly multiple reach finish line approved use around world. approved countries others. 

The Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine closest finish line would stunned weren‚Äôt approved places. 

Perhaps moderna vaccine USA, still, able read study like, make informed decision. prefer one vaccine another, call around different pharmacies see stocking. given Hydroxycloroquine. fan base would rather talk remdesivir good hydroxycloroquine scam bought months ago. Honestly ""causes death"" wrong fucked up. know father hospice care cancer, died going put cardiac arrest death cert cause death. cancer put hospice slowly killing him. Nope, cardiac arrest doc said normally put since die heart stops beating. Yeah that‚Äôs value judgment value judgments can‚Äôt used decide things. Yes bad information. numbers can‚Äôt trusted? No, it‚Äôs case closed. hasn‚Äôt ‚Äúproven‚Äù, proven word that‚Äôs used science extremely rarely, all.

The reason brought fact pandemic hasn‚Äôt ended, would realize you‚Äôd read article linked, *observed correlation could demonstrate causality* eliminated adding recent results. 3-4 month old articles posted using data March, April, May. months data countries high BCG vaccination, effect disappeared. didn‚Äôt even anything differently analytically, added data!

So ‚Äúproven‚Äù, it‚Äôs actually likely rejected. mean RCTs come back it‚Äôs effective, GLADLY first admit I‚Äôm wrong. tough time believing you‚Äôll though. even effective, per study SFU.

Just particular government. 

Replace leadership trust earned back. It‚Äôs heroic it‚Äôs unnecessary unethical. level transmission high many places challenge trials aren‚Äôt needed.

They aren‚Äôt even faster normal studies. it‚Äôs pointless.

Add fact laboratories creating infectious coronavirus potential disaster. I'm curious many people know got described bad cold.  lot based what? Pictures? actually know many BLM protestors nationwide masks vs mask? know many gathering?  people work hospitals saying counting deaths. wife RN told possible. She‚Äôs hears lot colleagues. she‚Äôs seen first hand patient considered covid death although died natural causes. 

But likely lots unreported covid deaths people didn‚Äôt seek medical attention. Especially beginning testing sparse. Driving muscle memory people weren‚Äôt driving much good 2-4 months. outline.com allows view large number articles pasting article's link field page same. really sick late last fall. still think Covid since flu test strep came back neg etc. husband gone ought box masks early Nov. quarantined room. wearing mask LONG anyone even mentioned wearing one. think husband daughter never got ill did. sick months, stuck bed. high fever, couldnt breathe. ox sat low. pink eye first time life. dont care CDC etc say. know sick was. tried instacart store pickups ? going store also put everyone around risk might virus. really one tune reading comprehension now, it? article outlines difference cases reported - large testing capacity everyone access testing showing symptoms (and cases without symptoms) - testing capacity limited severe cases health care staff tested. know this! know seems long ago, seemed Lombardy even France good shape mid-March.

They weren't. Italy locked 8 March, believe. Ischgl one first places demonstrable, large outbreak (i.e., could actually test enough) actually closed sent skiers home ‚Äî seems even then, underplayed extent outbreak.

However, then, likely virus widespread throughout Europe, perhaps 10s thousands cases per day almost certainly hundreds daily cases large European countries. symptoms? random vertigo, I've never ears seemed clogged bit around Feb. already tinnitus. figured allergies, live 5 others everyone seemed mild cold. Lmao...literally comment replying to: way knowing [COVID 2X dangerous] idea many people infected. cool story mate. Wait kidding? Lol first source says majority population concerned economy infection? Wouldn‚Äôt support stance? reality people ready spend money. It‚Äôs observable, it‚Äôs reality, it‚Äôs probably changing. obduracy hard stomach. live work recovery.. suggested attend funerals friends clients die.

An easy task skeptic like would go local AA clubhouse check pictures wall. take names look listed cause death.

For phenomenon well known recovery community... headstrong objection would comical subject grim. Pssssh said transmissible human human, shut travel, US longer deals with?

You actual scientific source bought China? Yeah! Sanity temporarily prevails WI. state legislature working OT overturn draconian infringement god given rights hopefully arrest Wisconsin's slide communist state. really hate state legislature. Wtf? circumstance would saying, ""Not could bad, worse that,"" mean, ""don't that?""

Consider uncertain situation. Someone hides something cup say, ""Not looking cup could bad, worse, looking cup."". 

It makes difference all. still telling look cup. making piss poor defense chose distort meaning suit yourself, tried pull logical rhetorical fast one obscure it, figuring one else would able call it. Nice try.

Pure projection. sympathies former employer actually paid edit. stay home isolate want. rest us live lives. Sweden already though lol. It‚Äôs necessary create virus lab inject people test vaccines disease cure cause long term effects.

We many places virus uncontrolled. It‚Äôs better test vaccines actual virus real world situations.

I‚Äôm surprised many people support lab created virus. Nope, I'm talking numbers could trusted showed numbers new cases dropping. never mention time number cases reported artificially low lack testing. Nope, totally accurate...

But now... we're supposed compare current numbers numbers older numbers accurate...  everyone get groceries means I'm forced go store restrictions get crowded store people masks. covid crockpot go advice would keep open mind. 

This article suggests long-lasting protection cases, least four months antibodies. reason longer data goes back four months time writing article.

Could forever? Probably not, based know coronaviruses, although SARS1 looks promising regard ‚Äî although much dangerous disease actually caught it. Weeks seems unlikely except mildest cases body barely lifted finger stop disease first time around. 

So somewhere range months years seems like would typical, reality know. breathe would think so, except previous mask mandate struck down. are. I'm horrible gotten vaccinations adult. I'm great blood draws, good news! bit nervous getting one, silly sounds. Despite consistent evidence SARS-CoV-2 contamination surfaces survival virus certain surfaces, specific reports directly demonstrated fomite transmission. It‚Äôs talking competing vaccines causing confusion. Lab conditions different reality also like article says. Early pandemic said could live 9 days non-porous surfaces...but again, that's lab conditions. article reveals anything new plus says detectable surfaces not, importantly, detectable levels could infect you, still question needs answered. surveillance today could able stop bars operating much easier time. **Hey now, star** gives us range. refers range reducing average 15.......can‚Äôt even believe break down. I‚Äôm glad went got numbers totally part study conducted. Bravo. True. glanced article later. never said anyone said ""lockdowns work"". Obviously lockdowns work. Diseases can't spread there's one spread to. 

What said [""Health experts saying lockdowns good clearly try hard. 6,000 health experts multiple different countries agreeing thing? Practically one except Trumpies. movement started US declaration signed nearly 6,000 scientists medical experts across globe well 50,000 members UK-based experts signed Dr Sunetra Gupta, epidemiologist Oxford Nottingham University self-harm expert Prof Ellen Edinburgh University disease modeller Dr Paul say keeping lockdown policies place vaccine available would cause ""irreparable damage, underprivileged disproportionately health harms cited include: lower childhood vaccination rate worsening care heart disease cancer point risk coronavirus 1,000 times greater old infirm, children risk flu Covid-19.

Are denying science right now? think stupid. Great work. Chinese show way deal disease. Despite downvote brigading going sub anyone shares one simple truth, real:

You get COVID twice. That's good wasted least. spring, government scientists began discussing invest vaccine research, wanted test number vaccines once, ‚Äî what‚Äôs known master Anthony S. Fauci, director National Institute Allergy Infectious Diseases, favor idea. mega-trials pose business risk given vaccine maker reveal vaccine stacks competitors. Funny FHM telling us back June... back numbers could trusted showing numbers cases falling.

It sure hell seems like expected trust numbers show good news Sweden, show bad news Sweden.

Funny, that. Maybe try re-learning statistics. might help intelligent. still ppl DIED. fuck wrong ppl? deaths could prevented. doesn‚Äôt take away ppl DEAD. stop trying find tragedies one situation we‚Äôre now.

it‚Äôs absolutely disgusting. risking others lives fun you? Sounds bit sadistic don‚Äôt think contact tracing

Sources contact tracing states touch vs air? need undertesting since Olympics postponed. ...do think average age stroke patient without COVID-19 40? that‚Äôs would article linked indicating people age 25 hospitalized strokes.

For record, average age stroke patient 72 women 69 men. irony insulting ability read completely failing comprehend article linked pretty hilarious. Chris Christie would like word. think resistance testing- like people aren‚Äôt gifting tested they‚Äôre deaths door? 

In area get tested moment cough fever diarrhea or....anything. They're going ""possible"" around here. bias, agenda driven conversation. Automatically guilty. excess death rate reliable source see wether deaths significantly changed one year next. 
And see excess death 12% comparison previous years. , also less.

I think rational person thinks COVID infections killed almost 300k people. think rational person thinks President Trump's response responsible almost 300k deaths. think count many people would died done everything perfectly full knowledge every action's repercussions interesting thought experiment, completely arbitrary going based fact. simple fact happen almost 300k people died. preventable, maybe were.

""History books record people downplaying virus! People learn this!"" Said historian furiously transcribing anti-mask leagues 1918.

As usual, bunch us learned nothing. concluding paragraph:

 Finally, true know long trained innate immunity persists, randomized clinical trial MMR versus placebo health care workers nonhuman primate study test MMR BCG model COVID-19 infection go far answer questions. date, trained innate response BCG suggests immunity functional approximately 1 year based infant vaccinations studies animal model fungal/bacterial sepsis show MDSCs induced quickly (within 7‚Äâdays vaccination) relatively long-lived (up 120‚Äâdays) Data also show protection afforded trained innate response achieved multiple lethal challenges time Since mouse studies relatively short lifespans, predict fairly long half-life immune-tolerant trained response humans. Indeed, sequelae hospitalization associated COVID-19 infection much reduced children, teenagers, even young adults early 20s Children often get MMR vaccine three times age 11. Thus, possible nonspecific protective effects provided live attenuated vaccines quite long-lived. known, however, suggesting MMR vaccination given eligible adults vaccination within year, immune preventive worst sequelae subsequent COVID-19 infection.  Spreading specifically wrong medical information good. Needs called out. witnessing mass extinction event. 

Words meanings. That's mass extinction event is!

Oh, shitshow. million Americans eventually die this. avoidable too. deaths Trump.

But even 1% humans die. mass extinction event, 90% _species_ wiped out.

COVID bad ""asteroid hits earth"" also bad blood draw experience passed really hard time coming to. traumatic and, never liked needles prior experience, didn‚Äôt many issues now. helped asking phlebotomist distract me. chatterbox phlebotomists best! act like it‚Äôs big deal talk ear ask questions, brain hard time focusing needle. me, sitting silence needle arm worst!! takeaway study. sensationalization sharing facts. 

Coronavirus found survive 28 days controlled lab setting following:

*Consistent 20¬∞ C
*No UV light 
*No wind
*In isolated form within droplet contains mixtures, elements and/or compounds (like often case spread cough sneeze).
*With careful placement ensure sample remained undamaged

Exposure literally hundreds different compounds mixtures renders virus inert, researchers honest presentation, Reuter‚Äôs screwed presentation fear sales, knowledge creates calm confidence. smoked 2 years 15 17 hadn‚Äôt in20 years long plate isnt visible clear. want possibly hurt someone blur identifying info like face. born dumb? one reasons cost providing healthcare high US. Let's get easy, routine, preventative care, let's wait minor infection illness life-threatening! viral pandemic started March -- MONTHS AGO -- using hand sanitizer touching things like ATMs?! use hand sanitizer time I'm wash hands get home.

Folks: wear mask use hand sanitizer. rocket science. I'm watching tenterhooks Canada. used love traveling US, loved meeting sharing stories Americans. I'm agitating keep border closed indefinitely I'm scared going bleed country November 4. Sure don‚Äôt think 8-9% positivity devastating make be. 

They aren‚Äôt testing lot Covid isn‚Äôt really problem heard line coronavirus nurse Florida. Can't really debate job. Sometimes people get upset others something good keeps reminding something wrong. 

It's fair, immature. pretty common. It‚Äôs going vaccines USA Europe made partnership multinational corporations testing worldwide. Donald Trump isn‚Äôt going pee ones American use. 

Messaging like posted literally going cost lives.  silly man. Home masks come off. Damn much take? 

I pop benzodiazepines, beta blocker, alcohol, smoke weed still function good sober many countries reporting numbers correctly. best get genereal idea countries report accurate numbers don't. Excess death gives clue. see pattern now: make numbers post facts. either Russian troll moron. both.

Big difference: getting car crash easy prevent wearing mask. contagious. know (hope) can't stupid?

So following brilliant idea, cars. getting work, family, shopping much harder people. solve problem? Whereas, putting mask. Done. Virus controlled worldwide within weeks. Wearing mask cause problems. heartbreaking amount people lost already. I'm lucky enough live country fully shut early people listened. mindblowing watching people living US saying real. Invest bidet. melatonin? help sleep cycle? universal healthcare medical system probably way better US even re-open see harm 

Plus, even anything goes wrong, there's always US bail actual excess deaths 36 percent higher number officially attributed COVID-19.

So probably well past quarter million covid deaths US. mean... used nebulizers spray virus sealed container light it? reading right? don‚Äôt see that‚Äôs applicable real world could actually say ‚Äúyeah hangs air 16 hours.‚Äù Even researchers concluded coronavirus ‚Äúmay viable airborne pathogen.‚Äù Shut fuck up, Qbert I'm highly pro-vaccination. grandfather ran TB clinic Australia. heard vaccination, made business drive business pushing vaccinations, worked.

But accept American vaccine. whole process subverted Trump administration.

Luckily, live anymore. 5% people infected worst hit countries blood checked traces virus.

Just multiply current number dead 20. didn‚Äôt suggest following American Model. saying Chinese bungled first response caused global pandemic incompetence, intransparency authoritarianism. *Narrator: Trump Patient Zero White House superspreader event* Basically hospitals get bit medicare covid patient. generally cover extra cost caring covid patient knowledge, kind torches idea profit. Next none, really. Aside maybe Taiwan, Sk NZ.

Problem see, Cuba depends lot Tourism. So, open up, inherently likely import cases. Unsure getting downvoted. 

Most people flowing ERs Orthodox communities, NYC, now.

Cuomo DeBlasio worried PR nightmare closing Orthodox Jewish neighborhoods religious ceremonies, took entra 2 weeks act anything. 

And we're seeing results. Hopefully I'm wrong restrictions keep expanding full-blown 2nd wave NYC, look way right now. Daddy chill bet majority toddlers would agree. would complain cheese too. Karen.  situation multiple locations take different approaches this, matter when, if, reintroduction occurs.  

New York sub 1% positivity rate, new infections get imported started people visit example. I'm highly pro-vaccination.

But would _not_ accept American vaccination COVID. whole approval testing system grossly publicly subverted.

Luckily live Europe.  what's **your** solution? example 800k cases 80k deaths, insane.

Lol indicates several times cases showing positive tests, nothing else. What?

Are kidding right now?

Because article discussing sweden. 

I know people always read article, lazy even read title?

 [Source | work hospitality, I'd furious 2/3rds wage thing too. many MPs sat home constituencies little? 2/3rds pay. Giving bonuses denying nurses theirs... complete scumbags. I've noticing past year myself, even Covid came about. It‚Äôs known while. completely stopped reported deaths cases long time ago. went daily cases zero overnight. People read headlines. ""Japan records 432 new cases coronavirus"" sounds pretty good it?

It sound good that's 5037 tests. known mid Januari virus spreading orally. lying alright. feel same, since thing started I've also seen lot people driving crazy, aggressive, distracted...

Though happening bit even Covid, noticed. kept wondering political highly divided state country something it. Everyone seemed ready pop. That's lot dead Americans Trump responsible for. Meanwhile America (cue Benny Hill music) haven‚Äôt seen family live Canada U.K. almost year idea I‚Äôll able see somehow it‚Äôs safe enough people crowd bars go weddings. It‚Äôs depressing.

/s does, way handled helped lot. Trust me, america island exactly like NZ Trump would still found way infect everybody. Enough people voted guy give fuck US. half Nobel peace prize winners Wow - can't imagine US testing anyone based 12 confirmed cases, much less 9 million. Jeez, sounds absolutely horrible.

Keep fighting, dont let ruin education. they're applying patents, there's lot reason optimistic this. fact stored room temp without anything else needed huge well. article preprint peer-reviewed \[what mean?\]. reports new medical research yet evaluated used guide clinical practice.

I think source still valid, wait little longer posting. 6-10% truly covid. frustrating

CDC confirm this... eradicate it? Restricting travel Americans coming home February would wild US president do.

Restricting non US citizens entirely different story.... I've got relatives Chengdu, among others :) Yet large portion Americans seem believe opposite, Republicans conspiracy theorists. people know who's parents work nurse also believe deaths, even cases general, overreported misreported. False positives, bad testing, reality. surely every country, ones low population like northern Europeans smaller ones.... glasses provide degree protection

Also, series appointments interactions would need go order get lasik would seem defeat purpose avoiding infection. worried wearing mask time worried that? live ‚Äúgood‚Äù region US we‚Äôre getting fucked right tourism big fall people want celebrate Halloween we‚Äôre flooded staters don‚Äôt care. It‚Äôs horrifying. appreciate concern (much better opposite), significant body data regular medical masks effective n95 masks non-aerosol environments (basically anything would exposed unless work healthcare), buying n95s takes away people need them. 

Also likely mass extinction. 1918 flu much deadlier still killed 50 million people (I say ‚Äúonly‚Äù compared total population, that‚Äôs less 3% population). infectivity mortality COVID lower H1N1 strain. Ontario, Canada. Part round education cuts included pushing mandatory online courses high school students. delivered third party providers; Ontario teachers. stepping stone government wants go education healthcare: privatization. Schools certainly responsible cases pubs pubs responsible spread (think it‚Äôs around 4% clusters). thoughts everything possible closing schools. system doesn‚Äôt exist get children caught lost schooling prolonged period, 3 months lost already massively problematic. 

And ignores impact working trying home school. 

I get you‚Äôre hospitality business hugely bitter pill swallow, children‚Äôs education definitely prioritised ability people beverage. closing everything schools get R number route taken. can‚Äôt short sharp full lockdowns adopted. China, saying 7, like 7000. people gov untrustworthy. UK's total positives roughly twice Japan's total number tests.

The UK also performed nearly 15x amount Japan undoubtedly could test vastly more, hugely unlikely situation bad countries like UK, France, BeNeLux.

I think bad UK France, say is. However, potential much worse present. Japan double population countries, densely populated cities work commutes horrible close quarters. careful masks, distancing, etc... flu spread used to.  going people's homes softly (or softly) threatening them?

Good you, stay safe. They're absolutely lying. Sure are.... That's people making over-simplistic arguments time like ""if people wear masks distances go away!"" know live, areas country took really far still huge # cases. Obesity, comorbidities, age also play huge role.  obesity epidemic global phenomena, simply cannot care America to, let's say, Vietnam Japan, due this.  We've also prided melting pot travel destination, people retroactively want ability shut travel snap finger stop covid, even though anyone slightly follows news knows politicians fighting travel bans February. lives somewhere else year, say whole ""travel bans racist"" pretty much American way thinking, countries see connection racism close damn border.

Like hard wear fucking mask people don‚Äôt lose lives ignorance? one ""Sweden compared nordic countries"" - people chance? Eventually deliberately lying covering guess. Well yes, also increase suicides due massive civil unrest, uncertain times increase depression. Really wish government would take things seriously. always wary people works for, works well, people complications totally fucks eyes. large number patients zero, either, much like covid want play odds. anyway general rule thumb avoid kind elective surgery, will. mode impossible copied countries. Testing one entire city feasible cities contained cases. Different countries different stages. Flatening curve trying reopen slowly even risk exists things countries do. kind insane cruel covid-19 people's lives. Economy life continue. Definitely cases creep 1.1% (like last two days):  talking people believe COVID hoax propagated liberals

It top-down, minced words order impeached, diseased president. repeatedly said total hoax, infected infecting staff. Many old people *will* die man. gf's father died month ago hoax. GOP silent, republican moron associates suggested died old age. FUCK tRump. China always gave damn citizens, citizens. mom stepdad almost died firmly side covid-deniers. 

It‚Äôs insanity. Oh fuck! collecting data 2-26 year olds whole time. Dammit, able prove point.. No. Consider bulk recovered patients available study recovered approximately 4 months ago. finding significant declines levels certain kinds antibodies now. Nothing said longer time frames. I‚Äôm sorry. FFS. That‚Äôs proper response someone tells mother died. 

I‚Äôm sorry loss. Yeah I've seen spouting complete bullshit many times, like call it. fun. 1.37 million employees, that's lower percentage country overall. 

Sounds bad, though, right? See agree work without coercion believe Chinese authoritarian style leadership true leadership sense word. guess could technically termed form leadership.


I believe America live drop ball big time. smartest thing close borders closed completely.

I prefer choice matters believe case would worked better people unified instead divided personal beliefs levels intelligence beliefs science lack beliefs science.

My goal since starting family many years ago make sure complete control choices. going five generations prepared family incident may happen. able bug mid late January go completely off-grid luxury comfort.

I think long road ahead us far infections escalation this. Mine stabilized still it. went consult said changes big enough put procedure. youre really interested spoken doctor yet should! Stated xenophobic allow people leave China go countries cause virus

Neighboring countries closed borders pretty fast. They've pretty wall. countries opted remain open want xenophobic can't resist Chinese tourism dollars. Countries like Italy rely heavily Chinese China lot stricter lot open information virus.

Normal guys like aware bad January. countries start enforcing strict action? example, people bought masks them, made sure faulty

Guaranteed people went shady Chinese middlemen assured could get hands masks. course lack export controls medical devices problem, since rectified. China issue. Indonesia Vietnam found producing substandard masks well. gone long unnoticed.

Qingdao quite international city, used German colony Japanese colony. beautiful city quite popular choice expats.

The fact first known cases linked hospital used treating imported cases makes quite likely error protocol let reintroduced case spread. Says guy tried going back work scared getting sick. making living unemployment felt entitled living welfare state? still think worlds problems caused dems libs happy suck teet governing philosophies? sick, hypocrite. kind him, reach post count quota, non personed marked re-education. getting end pretty hard lock stated July. pretty much everything closed, allowed couple hours outside day can't 5km house. pressure press etc government relentless. Premier ignored criticism seen popularity erode. go lock government face huge pressure stop it, ride (I can't see Borris able it) everyone need prepare pretty hefty mental toll. Yet, comment top thread.

Can believe it?? sub freakin insane days. used fair rational, seems opposition taken over. hate see Looks like someone takes article personally spend day commenting threads. Overall Sweden seems done fine. deaths plummeted. lol lol

Oh, serious? lel that's less number cases white house It‚Äôs good studies know long keep virus viable lab. want anymore deaths, happen believe Trump one responsible. virus serious cold, killed many. I'm downplaying that. also happen hate America. seeing several commenters continuously reply people providing sources going nuh-uh prove anything. 

How many times read people sharing sources researchers saying, assholes unison try blow off. what? want go mask-less middle school feel like edgy? 

When scroll this, quickly see several people providing sources several people denying dumb reasons. know every stroke case due covid-19 investigated, reported, tallied, processed printed. research ongoing...

It seems like bunch people spouting ""covid affect young people"" science revealing denying it, accepting would mean wrong may cause lot spread. makes feel guilty, deny scientists saying, demand higher level evidence. always demand higher level evidence. also demand higher level giving fuck fellow Americans.. Since scientific studies start turning theoretical statements absolutes?

True Pandemic death toll MAY much higher. wear mask procedure. tape face move around. I'm state mandatory masks. human being. Human beings susceptible virus. more, less. odds odds. blood type, age make less susceptible. NONE US IMMUNE. catch it, greater lesser response it. 

Nothing 45 told us ‚Äúpositive‚Äù true. 

It‚Äôs old people, people pre existing conditions. 

It‚Äôs people. Keep mind don‚Äôt wear mask, hang bars, go spend time people don‚Äôt live with. 

PEOPLE catch disease die it. one zero percent chance dying. 

Even 0.1%. Yesterday, 47000+ positive cases US. people still tested should, means really 150,000 470,000 people became positive yesterday. 

Even taking tested numbers, means 47 people low odds dying disease die it. 

Just one day‚Äôs testing results. 

We stop ignorant this. It‚Äôs dangerous. Tbh, conspiracy DNA harvesting something spreading around America well. That's lot people 23&amp;Me Ancestry shit YouTubers enjoy promoting. 

Though, guilty wanting try broke shit. people make furious. dad passed away May, stroke. No, doctor tell broken family watched father, grandpa husband fall dead bare hours ago want Covid death certificate, know *winky-wink* money. worked healthcare, checked make sure measles antibodies. not. Got vaccine again, still ‚Äútake‚Äù. anomaly happened mom brother. bizarre. one would expect serious virus first place. Even do, don‚Äôt capacity mass testing time. Like vaccine, spend 18-24 months develop. Nothing predicted learn it. isn't. People died covid much lower.  Unlikely, asymptomatic contagious 24-48 hours symptom onset. Sorry loss. also lost mother 2 days ago covid. drives mad people careless selfish. bad mom wasn‚Äôt president would best care, 15 doctors around her, medical helicopter experimental medicine :o. COVID ubiquitous US, know silly lot articles are. sorts edge case chronic conditions many diseases medications, reason COVID ones get played national level clicks. probably least dozen close friends/acquaintances gotten covid. they're life normal. algorithms designed trap people reading misinformation, they're designed engage people.

That disinformation engages them, different thing altogether. Let's blame algorithms people's shortcomings.

The algorithms great job. *Shocked Pikachu face* Yeah right circumstances. They‚Äôre meant used prevent widespread infection. rolling tool. Well lovely freedom country imploding 200k deaths. live small country called UigherGenocide. right border Maoism, across road Tienamen Square. Even tie laces, still use it.


Serious. actually know someone Amazon plant Indiana quit working conditions close proximity. Even though quit, able make case State Indiana unemployment hearing. Good luck others! agree. buddy telling get flu shot. I've never one life. disheartening see rise anti mask sentiment weather gets colder think test ‚Äúre-educated‚Äù citizens? viruses like host live long enough spread.

Did take poll likes? use condoms! MS Econ lol. Please stop embarrassing urself Korea say shit March already? good start. However, still allowed people leave areas country. Stated xenophobic allow people leave China go countries cause virus. people virus able spread around world. 

Now, also say fault countries testing well enough airports. good point. regardless, China lot stricter lot open information virus.

Also, way dealt aftermath treated countries affected virus good well. example, people bought masks them, made sure faulty. Iirc, also bragged countries need get masks them, specifically asian countries. pander China get none. Though words one politicians, I'd rather apply entire government China. What's point, believe anyway, like believe really free. That's part countries propoganda.

But I'll tell this, people need coercion take lockdown seriously. took whole disease incredibly serious, live mandate going yet streets empty. Nothing dictatorship, trust science. ""news"" *OAN*. know reintroduced? According article Qingdao, correct I'm wrong, international Chinese city half asymptomatic. Seems plausible spreading undetected got picked authorities person developed serious enough symptoms rather someone getting guy came abroad. economy take nearly big hit 1957 1968, comparable pandemics one terms per capita deaths. Swedish economy shrank significantly smaller amount rest world. 

I agree shutdown cause - fear people would caused fewer patrons businesses. also tied response. Instead reporting calm factual reporting virus, almost always spun fear-mongering narrative.

The entire premise article posted assumes *can* control virus. see surge Europe right now, ""controlling"" virus seemingly impossible. No, point least companies going make bank making vaccines don‚Äôt even work aren‚Äôt safe won‚Äôt deal financial fallout already got paid. guaranteed profit them. exact issue people problems with. ignoring evidence come conclusion based emotion, evidence cant change position. need present emotional argument counter order change position. Dems fail often existing republican base, fail provide emotional element (even readily available). know much province, area test people symptoms ask tested.

 city 100,000 people test 200 day. bit 800 confirmed active cases, 29 hospitalized 4 ICU, total 1200 cases far 4 deaths.

On first wave 200 cases 1 death total, cases least 3 weeks numbers still raising... That's weird! heard dad last week DEFINITELY talking ass drunk study showed mortality rates actually consistent comparison previous years :O

And no, really opinion, fact Trump done worst possible job. Period.

The crazy thing could hero easily. get way let experts handle it, bang, he's rock star would lost even half people have, including children, high schoolers college kids, elderly. pictured cage full coughing sneezing hamsters. "" does, people coming airplanes tracked quarantined far easily coming foot, car train. ""

Absolutely - forget Trump sec. subs back January, period tens thousands foreigners (many American) planning leave China. immediately Wuhan lockdown Jan. 23rd.

Before travel ban China EU, Trump's first speech addressing pandemic mid March - people coming China, every major US airport - thousands tens thousands per day. even much temperature check - incredibly negligent, goes directly toward quote excised comment. 

And even travel bans, US citizens could travel back strong covid checks around late April. 

As island argument, think anyone seriously deny island relatively small population comes inherent advantages dealing Covid. now, I've seen, successful pandemic responses smaller countries close epicenter Wuhan. Russia India two major exceptions relatively poor responses. Vietnam exception successful response, huge population geography historically subject foreign exploitation, quite remarkable outcome them. '

I accept comparing Vietnam Japan's Russia's response US - due fact quite large geographically, highly populated least 100mil. much harder make one one comparison island. alas, yes, course NZ, Taiwan, SK, smaller countries leaders effective responsive Trump administration. Yes, actual study really give weight entire depression angle. mentioned passing. 

It's interesting note excess deaths highest midwest south tended less strict lockdowns quick reopen. would reiterate cause excess deaths attributable depression lockdowns. like definition left basically boils high top marginal income tax. Stop spewing bullshit. dude straw man fetish.

Setting scarecrows fucking publicly get off. want collect people's DNA name No, I'm American stupid fuck.

If mother catches COVID, likely die, luckily state lax things even get people bitching masks rules.

Utterly meaningless. 


While there‚Äôs enough hard evidence confirm COVID-19 causing strokes, experts across world noticed trend. 

Ok...show us trend! talking? 

Is different strokes caused cold virus? guys laughing asses every time one us drops dead, look awards post. (Wholesome Award? ) (Rocket Like?) (Excited Award?) Look comments laughing people dying. guys could care less, think hilarious happening America. Europeans always hated country. Sorry loss. Grandmother died COVID well. obviously older sister, get furious people tried minimize deaths. significant pre existing conditions (she arthritis, that's it). final years stolen her.

I zero respect anyone making argument real, deaths ""don't count"". competent leadership quality, government complete control citizens citizens lack true freedom.  One could argue viruses alive.

Whatever opinion definition alive, pretty obvious *meant* say viruses still alive. China surrogates bought world's supply played virus. USA fucked up, large, many fronts. fault. wear mask everywhere go I'm locking make choice US. Excellent point! metallic thread sewing fabric. Fauci, Sergeon General , everyone reddit coronavirus sub time tweeted ""stop buying masks"" article: Looking excess deaths occured better measure pandemic‚Äôs disproportionate effect communities simply tallying total number COVID-19‚Äìrelated deaths, according study lead author Andrew Stokes, BU School Public Health assistant professor global health. ‚ÄúExcess deaths include COVID deaths ascribed causes, well indirect consequences pandemic society,‚Äù says.
Indirect consequences could include people afraid go hospital another condition fear catching coronavirus number issues caused exacerbated COVID-19‚Äôs economic mental health impacts, loss health insurance layoffs, inability afford medications pay cuts, skyrocketing rates depression America‚Äôs adults, condition negatively impacts many aspects health. Elevators. think eating beforehand mess lab results, especially blood work general physical.

We've mismanagement everybody Leadership president hard people truly understand situation. added fact free America makes nearly impossible could unify one side fight. way think even remote chance happening would death rate went hundred fold people truly scared. Hong Kongenese particularly anti-China especially among younger population point even care harms themselves.  Taipei Vietnam; countries' leadership never centered stories?! much higher. friends father died early heart attack. hospital wouldn‚Äôt admit due COVID-19. Virus fuck 2-3% infected people death.

Oh, doubt, NZ really good situation taking politics account. people say could like NZ... definitely could not, even could done better job. interaction outside world via packages deliveries. 41 kids many LA county? Sensationalist clickbait. That's I've doing. Staying home can. Wearing masks/distancing absolutely can't. kind feel like I'm prison sorts point is. remain frustrated seeing everyone else go back life normal though may argue got sick back March April whenever fine fully immune therefore take precautions. Since immunity can't contract spread say. Ima go limb say looks red. Yes, China totally honest tell rest world testing 9 million people week. Get real common usually takes victims entire life die guess? Even government enabled deaths, would argue covid still caused them. yeah, government responce shit far Zzzzzzzzz Yeah, going spread intra house whether people wear masks. much proximity, many shared spaces. Lol use nuclear weapon USA would mean everyone dies. nuclear subs sitting depths waiting, game nation going play. I'm frustrated type report difference deaths related direct infection kept separate deaths occurring due ""community COVID response measures"". Otherwise attributing drug side effect disease instead drug. Public health professionals need clear data determine responses protect publics heath &amp; shift risk factors. Yes wish could agree, surge....it's coming. really - that's take-away this, enormous gap testing policy China US? Let simplify - find 12 positive cases reaction test 9 MILLION people. We, hand, nothing reaction 50,000 positive cases per day.  See difference? Exactly. Wash hands - use hand sanitizer don‚Äôt access wash hands. Don‚Äôt touch eyes, nose, mouth public. Avoid inside spaces strangers, online orders/curbside/drive thru much possible. hire hooker, new European way kissing, wear mask doggy style keep several feet big head hers. ü§ò amusing almost nobody commenting actually read article, pointing people died due effects lockdown. know tools.. i've never seen research paper ""back-of-the-envelope"" calculations. Man got lasik done 2 years ago seriously best thing I've ever done. got sketchy groupon too, lol No. failing governments issue. incumbent upon step cover difference, option let virus rage population. I'm sick ""the cure problem!"" shit. charge problem refuse deal reality.

You think lockdowns preventative measures issue, think fault charge whose responsibility adapt overcome within confines situation. impossible task, choice. possible contain virus. people think it‚Äôs half problem. costs less control virus bail companies help individuals. denial olympics guess decided keep playing hand Well, Canada vs. U.S. like comparing apples fucking leprechauns. suck here. didn‚Äôt bother read article all.

And neither clearly says people died things came pandemic Covid itself. 

From article read:

""‚Äú_Excess deaths include COVID deaths ascribed causes_, well indirect consequences pandemic society."" wrong.

It could done, act quickly efficiently - US wide swathes population never leave state, let alone country. government programs make needed PPE vaccines

I still understand ""operation warp speed"" limited vaccines. program also created ""warp speed"" increases PPE production.

PPE vaccines two things _really_ reduce suffering death thing. curious: getting upvotes? like 3rd time I've seen articles sub potentially inhaled COVID vaccines. 

Not even recently. comes goes, ""this sterois treatment cheap potential tool COVID, tested successfully mice"".

I'm less gloom, concrete improvement looking at? Maybe try antibiotic.

Arg. don‚Äôt know meant longer post. comparisons influenza neither doctor, epidemiologist, view assessing dangerous disease is, need factor 2 primary things, deadly per person, likely infect large numbers people. Something kills 0.1% patients infects 10 million dangerous something kills every patient, infects handful. COVID19 unfortunately beats influenza categories, I‚Äôll show below, comparison isn‚Äôt close.

:Just focusing mortality rates, they‚Äôre easy get stats NZ influenza kills 500 people annually, infects estimated 10-20% population 500,000-1000,000 500 fatalities = 17th September 2020 using New Zealand New Zealand, hospital system operating within capacity, overwhelmed cases, less ideal circumstances. think it‚Äôs likely case count NZ pretty close actual number 1802 25 fatalities = know Infection Fatality Rate, conservative estimates put around IFR 0.5% 
Rod Jackson's (epidemiologist) article herald puts IFR 1% least important: shorter generation time, higher number people average infected person infect, high R0 disease like measles infect community faster low R0 like masks, vaccinations social distancing force R0 down, crowded living conditions, packed churches concerts sports games force time number days generation virus takes. virus R2 10 day generation, every 10 days number infected Seasonal influenza (Distinct pandemic influenza) suggested 1.4 time estimated 7 days take higher value R0 comparison: 10 people influenza (R0 1.6), 5 generations (approximately 35 days) 105 people infected. 70 days it‚Äôs 1100 infected influenza, exponential accelerating disease article published 22 September puts COVID 2.3 generation time 5.2 ten people COVID19 (R0 2.3) 35 days (6.73 generations) 2719 people infected. 70 days we‚Äôre 739,361. Somewhere around day 80 reach 70% New Zealand‚Äôs population infected, influenza hasn‚Äôt yet hit 3000 day 80. around 50-70% population immune could cause herd immunity kick in, force R0 down, given time develop immunity, diseases, antibody production well underway around 14th day onset symptoms. using conservative numbers COVID 5 20 times deadly influenza, per patient, health system working comfortably within capacity much faster rate transmission, quickly overwhelm Health system, fatality rate much higher influenza, it‚Äôs even start talking ‚Äúlong haulers‚Äù post COVID syndrome OP user name üòÇ ""Well, lots additional deaths then..."" - America economic backup gov sounds great theory practice bankrupt us.

*I bot, action performed automatically.

Yeah imagine country actually something pandemic instead of, know, jack shit make shit ton money.  Yikes that‚Äôs pretty harsh. house clean, shower bathe daily kids, heck freak there‚Äôs papers crap left car. I‚Äôll admit use $10 KFN4 mask walk outdoor ATM I‚Äôm back car two minutes, I‚Äôm throwing away. couple cloth masks keep console drive thru windows. It‚Äôs hygiene issue much sheer probability one. CBP joke. I've flown couple countries (essential travel) every single country made effort - lines set force distancing (e.g. leaving empty row rows) distancing relatively well enforced every immigration official wearing mask - oftentimes higher grade (e.g. N95) ones that. 

I land back US get thrown scrum 400+ passengers crammed together. change line effort social distance. Even trying leave space front matter someone one foot away side queue rope. unsafe I've felt entire pandemic. 

I got sent secondary - add insult injury - half CBP staff secondary even wearing mask. yeah. sigh... Interesting. Thanks sharing! hear symptoms like come recovering Corona think infected asymtomatic. I‚Äôve brain fog many months point, sucks almost like understand virus may fit smaller aperture fibers mask, *the droplets they're conveyed don't*

But guess need ""do research"" Northern Ireland: Oh sit down. Ah, see.

I'm using IFR, I'm using reported cases/deaths. 

I know could argue one day long, I'll accept numbers as-is. :)

It'll ""interesting"" see happens places like North Dakota. They're confirmed 3.5% infection. CDC ""adjustment"" factor means total infections 21% 38% total population. 

My commentary covid remains - we're still learning rules game we're playing game. true infection/r0/death rates known couple years pandemic control go back look data. countries over-reporting everything covid deaths, countries pretending covid on...

And sucks, knowing death rate 2%, 0.2%, 0.02% kind big deal I'm want go store. need wash hands, wear mask, get bunny suit on? help scientists playing fast loose shitty stats have, well, even discuss insane politicians are. Nah. ‚Äúpassion Christ‚Äù. 
Followed by: ‚Äúthe revenant‚Äù 


I watched thought ‚Äúholy shit snuff flicks ‚Äú  difficult build virus. also think like hitting left hand right hand. Even China SK going strong, global economy still affecting hard albeit less harder rest us. rather rest country get sense act together . US clearly nowhere near WORST testing world. Maybe worst among peers. mean look somewhere like Yemen, barely able test anyone critically ill dying Wait, what? Could elaborate please? Waiting vaccine snuff. asserted people suddenly get tired next 6-8 months 40% get infected. There's evidence suggesting thats case even were, forfeiting game afraid losing equally ridiculous argument. Im sure think either points persuasive. provided evidence testing tracing isnt technically feasible outside South Korea either. Coronavirus puttin' [10 hour  Lmao tfw ur unironically telling me, 'society absolutely 8 months quarantine impact human race coronavirus deaths 100% fault corona, must able take raw rona death numbers total death count'. 

Im sorry bro far much me. need help. excess deaths finally made headway, let's hope move forward sewage viral counts. good catch, i'll edit Honestly gets food cooking still get sick. really want safe tbh, throwing food containers reheating food 30 minutes 175¬∞f -200¬∞ (based temp time takes kill sars virus) country best reputation then? Humor me. like german, arent you? wrong translation german media. civet, Masked palm civet ( Larvenroller) possible vector SARS. made smart speaking short research know closely related. still good point look need time someone smarter shares knowledge. worry it, rich richer ever ok. really matters world anymore. survey ask people ER severe injuries they've car crash, percentage people car crashes going really high.

Right. High positivity rate means ""we test sick people probably coronavirus, sure enough, lots coronavirus"".

If trying contact tracing tracking, means terrible job it. trying that, high positivity rate means efficient testing. Lakers celebration - *bad*

Armenians protesting - *not bad*

makes sesne Ironically, Dignitas closed due coronavirus. Sure damn hope so. I'm cautious one skipped af. yet one around wearing masks properly police enforce see many past years used determine normal. article seems suggest important take vitamin taking vitamin K2 supplements, I'm seeing important take vitamin K2 taking vitamin supplements. clarify? China America. public stunt. test going on, happen know it. sake mental health, really think putting lot resources investigating this. Like you, much believe case, wish examination this. Now, exactly would measure quantify much difficult question, think figure open outdoor spaces public activities, much better place now. Genuinely understand: total always exceed sum parts? Keep mind, done optimal settings virus. reality nowhere close. 361 cases almost exactly DOUBLE amount cases detected Monday one week ago (184). people social distancing, masks, hand washing pro death?


I guess that's get get GED Facebook. Making America great again. great since Spanish flu. can't even wear facemasks... Lol... Penetrates became prominently known even government ended apologizing treated him. Suck dick idiot, fuck Chinese dicktators! No, covid also spread surfaces air. Restaurants covid hot spots example. Also, everyone wear mask risk everyone greatly minimized. know masks work harmless. mandate them? cautionary tale well worth reading. fortunate living one safest (from Covid-19) locations North America present. seeing horror pandemic deaths Europe, tragedy occurred one long term care facilities. went lockdown followed directions public health officials. Getting safely collaborative effort. threat drowning bodily fluids enough want protect yourselves, think risk care providers definitely supersize.  maybe possibility going real Yankee game day. mixing North Dakota South Dakota? Yeah, unfortunately government president especially keep telling people problem people go lives normally that. Couldn‚Äôt get samples virus real world? We‚Äôre already study aren‚Äôt we? don‚Äôt understand we‚Äôd need ‚Äúcreate‚Äù anything lab. sad fact type Laker fans who'd go party Staples Center probably social distance time either. LA County can't get case load control. multi-hundred Tiktok influencer parties Hollywood Hills Greek parties USC UCLA there's huge swath under-25's DGAF. young adults want live Best Lives, covid damned. That's amazing! ......when kept 68¬∞F all-dark lab environment. **Get covid on, go infect** perhaps gotten broken up, huge reaction. That‚Äôs also great way lose election. Also, happens book process people? move people confined spaces without masks, seems like would make things worse. upcoming ski season going absolute clusterfuck. high positivity rate means they're testing people likely virus, means contact tracing.

It means ""we much testing"", ""the virus spreading everywhere"". ??? Calling blatant straw man misinformation? Keep lights on...   
This study done dark... normal everything competition USA. Herd immunity covid wishful thinking. chicken pox. America world's largest surveillance system. China's system plain sight, America's not. maybe, *juuuuust* maybe, important discuss certain medicine may recommended, integrity involved parties often correlates effectiveness proposed medicine.

We see similar situations Flesh readability score. reputable companies often much easier read quarterly reports. Companies without scandal conflicts interest generally reliable.

Took peek profile. scream ""ENLIGHTENEDCENTRISM"", know gonna vote come November third. guess makes death rate much lower Indirect consequences could include people afraid go hospital another condition fear catching coronavirus number issues caused exacerbated COVID-19‚Äôs economic mental health impacts, loss health insurance layoffs, inability afford medications pay cuts, skyrocketing rates depression America‚Äôs adults, condition negatively impacts many aspects health.

They definitely considering deaths indirectly caused COVID rather governmental policy. 

Not all, excess deaths consider indirectly COVID related. Thank üôè Look male chick culling. It‚Äôs pretty incredible (in bad way) seeing live baby chicks fed belt conveyor crusher. assume sell meat paste use dog food something it‚Äôs probably strongest argument Veganism ever seen. found snippet it, 5th movie. Brace Here's better link source [Li See how's never whistleblower disappeared?

What goddamn idiot. China hater make factually right, makes China hater.  Well, right conditions virus suvive indefinite. studies worth much everyday life. didn‚Äôt math me, really fucking stupid. Handing masks, sanitizers, bricks, malatov cocktails.  Still major concern spread others second time around! fun itself, no. 

But willing degrade life bare survival otherwise might pose vague danger someone. Nah 30/100 people city test positive compared say 1/100, means widespread community transmission.

I said another dude, 38% people SD positive, would fucking catastrophe. likely they're testing people likely COVID-positive, they're getting high positivity rate reflect actual infection rate. Time tell sure... even ""one-time"" diseases like chicken pox portion population get twice. small number people getting reinfected spell Doom yet.

We 6 months pandemic, 9 months world wide. reinfection widely possible 4 months would expect seen widespread reports already least internationally. really ‚Äúa study‚Äù found this? simply looking excess mortality numbers provided government subtracting lol Many ""normal conditions"" studies done, several iterations along. 15 days go 3 4 million.

17 days go 4 5.

22 days go 5 6.

24 days go 6 7.

23 days go 7 8. 


Things are...stable, least.  way data works compares deaths right deaths previous years without covid. Normally death rate flat, different region region normally change much. Now, covid‚Äôs rise, death rate doubled, small portion attributed covid. that? else would dying from? Interesting way try spin polls. two polls titled 

 1. worried Americans infection?

66.2 somewhat worried

2. worried Americans economy?

86% somewhat worried

The majority worried economy COVID. 

Again, standard proof weak. see people compared spring. fact, think know single person March/April. mean ""vast majority"" back pre-covid normal. argue dishonestly pre-supposed narrative without supporting evidence. truth concoct head necessarily support reality live in. That's polls conducted, data collected analyzed. Without better argument ""This see"" see point continuing debate. we're engaging make believe there's census poll-taking data around ppe protests. what's observable means.

Can't tell one group cause okay others isn't? absolutely can, wtf talking about? Remember 2 weeks behind Italy? important I'm trying figure what's safe immunocompromised household. long term, good know exactly one do.

Our rules: 

 * Never go within 6 ft anyone helped 

 * Never go indoors anywhere home helped 

 * Takeout using curbside okay, foodborne illness (food workers happily place food trunk car) 

 * Groceries okay, long basic food safety followed consuming

Studies like needed re-evaluate restrictive need be.

Unfortunately, part article randomly say 'continuing seemingly basic shit like washing hands cleaning surfaces' somewhat hurts article's integrity. hard find research topic that's CDC's vague, blanket statement. think virus inoculated come from? It‚Äôs produced lab approved.

Edit: here‚Äôs article virus creating. People advocating challenge trials seem skip point[coronavirus strain human kids need go school, people \*need\* go pub.  


Someone put better (Paraphrasing): schools open \*despite\* lot mitigations. lot mitigations \*so that\* keep schools open. post doctors saying that. can‚Äôt math lmao. 


I simply gonna reply math since special kind stupid. 

72 - 15 = 57

69 - 15 = 54

Neither 30 - 40. again, proven really really fucking stupid. Lmao. Dumb fucker. Stupidly special.

I comment like day. workday go faster, get attack type stupid got gram gram killed. Boy love attacking stupid, it‚Äôs showing much. Aerosols travel upto 30-40 feet. get attached air pollution particles prob cover distances. course still try best reduce chances practicing isolation/hygeine feel kinda pessimistic avoiding infection. Unpossible. high school friend Facebook watched YouTube video said Covid deaths made hospitals got paid extra it. 116 rooms, 20 protestors. Even assume significant number empty rooms right residents physically capable forming opinions matter attending protest, residents disagree people stayed safely rooms protest.

[Source 116 simply gonna reply math since special kind stupid. 

72 - 15 = 57

69 - 15 = 54

Neither 30 - 40. again, proven really really ducking stupid. Lmao. Dumb fucker. 

They didn‚Äôt math me, really fucking stupid lmao. USA far 8 million coronavirus cases. confirmed cases, infections never get confirmed. lot infections even symptoms.

The actual number infections likely 40 million so, know exactly. Beauty skin deep, dumb ugly bone. mean thing CDC warned us week pushed reporting responsibilities US government, US government, US government could start reporting much lower number actually was? time told ~180k CDC said soon reported 200k HIGHER that. wasn‚Äôt official word anymore. 180k was. Rule #2: install inept government leaders. Exactly. trust people telling hard, strong lockdown. WASN'T. People followed like 2 weeks max, media started boycotting it, creating distrust government scientists, people stopped caring, stopped following now. everyone gets covid get tested. 

Not everyone gets tested covid. 

But 30/100 people city test positive compared say 1/100, means widespread community transmission. 

In New York City breathtaking hospitalizations, precursor collapsing hospitals skyhigh test positivity rates. 

In summary, get covid probably die. 

But odds worse get covid time. See Wuhan, Iran, Lombardy, NYC kidding!! awful. masked friend here.  want close schools again? It‚Äôs 8 months since beginning pandemic nothing suggest affects kids serious way. would shown did. know school closures fucking catastrophic children‚Äôs education wellbeing, especially poorest children suffered biggest gap attainment home schooling. course economic devastation caused lockdowns across developing world currently plunging millions children back poverty misery. know well long term effects would be. 

So maybe ease fear-mongering labelling people abhorrent unless you‚Äôre willing take responsibility alternatives are. Agree that. hope return normal vaccine. airline tourism industries back normal long time. Even wanted go back pre Covid normal, countries also mercy rest world. Even people want travel, one allowing flights enter countries. inevitable travel industries suffer. see true effects impacts lockdown early middle next year. Dude saying correct thing incorrectly.

Basically, positivity rate 38%, likely testing enough (more probably) testing people likely COVID-positive. like this: survey ask people ER severe injuries they've car crash, percentage people car crashes going really high.  important I'm trying figure what's safe immunocompromised household. long term, good know exactly one do.

Sorry clear: talking cheap disposable ones. long they're fitted around nose pressed face, glasses top them, never fogging.


Medical N95s also fog glasses...all nasty moisture stays inside. people normally die honey? Im saying covid deaths didnt happen, cant compare total deaths. virus death rate curve. Thats meaningful data. cant take fucking lung cancer deaths add covid pile cuz went since 2019. Make sense? good news. Hopefully becomes safe side effects. Months go can't find reliable answers questions like long virus live apple? long potato chips? twice much trust US. 9 months nothing new virus easily linked systematic failure forced many people desperate situations. made up... hard used well. Every single time got vaccine blood test would get dizzy almost faint, one reasons I've never able donate blood. 

I guess I've become desensitized time, nowadays trouble it, admit fade away would trouble. 

Never problem vaccines, though. really know worry.

Thank Dr. BadBoyGoneFat. us take seriously given up! People power won‚Äôt anything it; wear mask careful go come contact with. opportunity control come gone.

One *highly* lethal, I'd rather country cases bird flu country cases swine flu. former, likely never get even second-hand know anybody got bird flu. garbage spreading among humans. latter, likely least know somebody got swine flu - means *that* close rolling dice yourself.

With coronavirus United States, chances get infected high many us refuse take seriously.

(also fun fact: one organism gets infected multiple flu viruses, mutate together form new flu virus properties both. Deadly bird flu originates factory farming avian animals like chickens. Highly contagious swine flu originates factory farming pigs. day two viruses meet single organism may mutate right give us highly contagious highly lethal flu.) sounds terrifying. Taking trial gives access something special exclusive one else (which makes people want brag it), taking official vaccine makes sheep everyone else (which makes people want reject feel like they're different 'special') many people outside contact?

And many people don‚Äôt take precautions packages ?   like since begining. ""Wahhh. They're reporting."" Facts. ""Deaths way up... beyond reported numbers. Wassup that?!"" using uncertain language like ,‚Äù could be‚Äù rather stating like confirmed fact. think estimates correct. really. Idiocracy least initially realized listen smart person. thing miss thread used resource people legitimate questions. Now, every fair question comment trail brigaders misleading them, telling reckless, pushing political talking points. really fucking pathetic sub become. shit, we've saying 200,000 last month, nobody anything different better, take genius figure we're still increasing. ""Going back normal"" arbitrary statement. Another example would ""... know it"". Change constant. also scary we're mist allot scary right now. fog lifts things changed. anyways. Fidget spinner thing anymore likely blowing candles huge birthday cake either.

The desire ""return normal"" reason we've gotten point. folks enacted recommended precautions virus would still spreading.

Society *as know it* *return normal*. Society culture that. always adapting. bruh entire life 20 degrees. 20 degrees I'm putting jacket turning heater. Trump's latest play remarkably effective. either never COVID he's faking recovering. either way, seeing obese, extremely unhealthy 74 year old man shrug makes even look around wonder wtf I've sacrificing 7 months for.

I know head right thing virus dangerous, I'm admit stunt works part me. making feel like that, millions simply going stop taking precautions all. even feel same. Happy cake day! enough ventilators around game system like would fantastic problem lol put face everyone died covid would probably think twice speeding shit. Trust I‚Äôm sick Ok i‚Äôm sorry insults anymore. You‚Äôre moron. gunshot reason death Covid would matter. People live years health conditions. Wether bad heart taking medicine diabetes etc. people many years live contacted virus. medical community expects limited distribution vaccine spring vulnerable populations. General avaliability ready fall. course assumes least one current candidates passes trials, seem pretty optimistic right now. So, two things happen once. 

Like, believe science also think racial justice issue deserves protesting. 

I believe state government collapse economy closes, even goes scientific recommendations. 

And last question, yes  basically paid one single bit attention happened past weeks? Good job. IFR HEAVILY skewed deadly elderly (70+)

IFR even 1% 55 far remember, still something like 0.4% 50s

I'm trying downplay pandemic, lethality virus, comorbidities not, *massively* skewed toward old age. 

Even vast majority (51% definition) fat diabetics 50s going die this. That's quote British foreign minister. u super efficient tracing no?

You mean, normal tracing. governments doing. Yep, started March it‚Äôs October : / guys behaved exactly like germany, would roughly 38.000 deaths whole USA... They're gonna test 9 million residents week, took 4 days get test results back state less 4 million people total, thousand actually tested. huge problem well. I've heard termed ""echo chamber'. hear opinions stories already agree view point. typical social media algorithm.

There single problem single cure, either Covid division happening country. going take years decades. gyms recently closed Quebec entering depressingly cold harsh winter it‚Äôs going get worse would rather high lethality disease low spread (ebola) spread community 

i agree, low spread/high fatality, least ppl overtly cautious least error side caution &amp; take measures True pandemic death higher everywhere. one really knows want know. people enforce regularly assaulted. Welcome back downplayer. know Trump actually better yet.

You also realize winter coming positive mental attitude reddit going stop what's coming.

What would stop good policy, people like prevent implemented choosing simply declare COVID big deal, bullying people agreeing. never understand people drop kicked sub months ago. New Zealand got right believe British goc provided support time. It‚Äôs difficult it‚Äôs must done. COVID analogies need include age, since *everything* COVID-19 outcomes wildly dependent age. everyone's hen house say many countries

You could! spoke like Trump could say lot things. say that. high positivity rates reflect relatively low number tests, what's going on. Uncle Joe trotting along happily without care world gets Covid-19, pretty safe say obesity contributes death, cause. That's incorrect say 'only' 6% deaths covid. 

The whole point diseases like yes, going harder conditions. That's they're danger population. want mentally subtract car accidents, get it, go dismissing everything else though 'healthy' deaths covid count. identify source(s) numbers chart? 

I‚Äôm itching share it, but: citations. true. family cautious hit 7 months exhausting. We've gotten comfortable certain areas homebodies randomly going shopping also 2 vacations canned year different events / festivals love get cancelled that's tough.

My parents way finally hit breaking point weeks ago went two trips mountains (while still distancing people) stuff considered earlier year.

Once hit Thanksgiving Christmas, going crapshow we're still path almost everyone trying create sense normalcy. Asking everyone operate within unmitigated disaster plan consistency 10+ months untenable frustrating. SSir :D countries follow example read flu strain covid, something effect

Yeah, oppose lockdowns homeschool over. public online school. Fake New! Democratic Hoax! Narrator: eliminated mean can't come back. Even child could understand that. Apparently watch college football. There's whole stadiums full now. come something China appears give damn citizens states currently do. Whether darkest timeline, still completely unexpected plot twist Insurance adjuster here. Deaths fraud intensity up. People desperate money freedome. gnarly suicides, drug related collisions, excessive speed losses, etc. last months I've ever seen before. really heartbreaking, mention time consuming. stats stand point, testing everyone bad idea. test population, false positives false negatives become really big. yourself. Feel free check. I‚Äôll even give numbers:

Go ahead got lasik 10 years ago raffle game changer really. much think vaccines cost? Literally. No. That's part risk going abroad, especially places like China. come plan bring back enforce quarantines returned. 

Restricting non US citizens one country virus many countries story all. token gesture incompetent president try pretend like anything. worked. He's failed literally every regard pandemic front yet idiot fans still say ""nah, fault, tried ban people China"". think masks, hygiene, distancing factor flu? Nope, fuck ccp. fan thiers know know talking about.  Yes counter argument quite intelligent.

Go ahead tell leadership China leading people I'm waiting. whine lockdowns ones goes houseparties vacations mate. exceptions. Honestly, American students worse. That‚Äôs problem, actually... teachers really, really good little. Take away math textbooks teacher compile stuff time dime.

The fact American students well huge credit teachers gotten used cuts figured job better less, even means spending money.  There's sweet spot. low risk false negatives. problem isn‚Äôt post conspiracy. problem post. example, claim 75,000 fewer deaths expected completely false link disproves this.. Masks. Tests. Paid leave sick. Penalties fines people breaking quarantine businesses violating distancing guidelines. Considering many companies developing vaccines would think this?

Perhaps couple years vaccine, many rolled out. Yeah 200K number counted. knows much missed, might actually double Careful, guys; talking owner lockdown-resistant sub! got mine done 26.. mean changing slightly ended slightly better 20/15 vision (better 20/20), degresses 20/20 bit worse really care. bad astigmatism completely useless without glasses/contacts see perfectly without anything. warranty go back touchups see needing anytime near future It‚Äôs fair.

I get downvoted people ideological High horses they're understanding argument here.

Yes America nations unified exact things would different result better result would argue.

My point competent leadership leadership function individual displays qualities point others follow person.

I've raised 10 children four grandchildren run multimillion-dollar company built nothing plus five companies built nothing living streets started. 

I might know small small small amount something leadership.

Chinese government officials display leadership give orders people must obey orders there's nothing leadership process. I'm open intelligent argument says otherwise comments shortcut thinking.

Freedom double edged sword freedom speech people like say people freedom religion people believe believe people don't. would argue true Freedom massive amount people lead lack incompetence.

But China's government leaders they're showing leadership amongst people they're giving orders people must obey. haha? switched contacts got pair lab goggles, well finally finding masks better seal. leakage, better protection, less clunky.  Na, it'll disappear, watch. China superior west every way, let annex us point. Generally never imagine it‚Äôs like teacher America they‚Äôre treated paid. 

Now definitely can‚Äôt imagine it‚Äôs like teacher America lack respect states *while* deal pandemic.

It must terrifying knowing little states care health teachers. many teachers America would bankrupt actually got sick.

I get it. could pay get plane right now. Lol, wrong. last checkup pre-existing respiratory failure pre-existing cardiac It‚Äôs authoritarianism. It‚Äôs culture. Russia poorly, South Korea Taiwan Singapore Japan well.  thought schools LA we‚Äôre still closed? understand children picking many settings seems large number. What‚Äôs going happen uk schools fully open little way restrictions. frighten parent hear things. one thing china take away pandemic badly rest world dealt we're fucked

More positively, look thinning herd. global macro perspective, even 1% death rate means world's population grow year.  live northern take least 4000 units safe. test supersize deficient ... I'm responding comment ""keep\[ing\] essential services going... may caused longer lockdown"" someone else saying need could get free food delivery home. course exceptions lockdowns ‚Äî exceptions necessarily quite broad, lots people seem suggest lockdown needs successful exceptionally strict fewer fewer people defined essential, letting everyone die concession. even close. Where's source Fauci saying masks work? US, Florida, filled elderly, reporting high number infection, hosting trump rally today hosting pence rally yesterday. pictures show older people, distancing, masks. Thats going away. Thanks murderous politics. People really get upset point casual racism. always impeached mean locking Wuhan serious enough? countries treating COVID lockdowns also healthy economies? 

At point, experts agree lockdowns good solution. one things like, ""technically might right"" but, else explain virus related deaths? Put back court. one clear likely scenario, weird outlier scenario... ask come outlier scenario heard conspiracy explain yet.

Edit: figure weird outlier people believe, run previous conspiracies. 1 100 might figure out...... one blame broken ass government point.

So let's say US government took seriously countries instituted stringent lockdowns. Hard curfews, police every corner ensure anyone leaving home leaving approved reason (IE get food), arrest massive fines anyone caught outside weeks time, reinstituted whenever there's another flareup.

Do think would lead less protesting mass gatherings US seeing currently? Implying Orthodox Jews cult height intolerance. crisis abated think time right conduct kind ‚Äòlessons learned‚Äô I‚Äôm sure World Health Organization forefront that,‚Äù right. sad, wrong Lockdowns can't complete everyone starves death. total lockdowns can't 100% effective long virus remains outbreak postponed lockdown.

So goal postpone inevitable sure work. just...won't... someone Tampa Bay Area fucked. lockdowns supposed buy time meassures. Strict work well without competent tests, quarantines contact tracing. Americans said china lies numbers Depends, economy?

/s Willful ignorance literally killing US now. Assuming sarcastic, RCTs already tried showed benefit. Facebook mommies gonna explode this. Halloween? Waaaaa, waaaa. amazing, Trump got sick, almost week daily thread free downplayers could actually discuss policy, science, etc.

Now he's ""better"" (we'll see), there's surge downplayers downvotes spare. Hmm... Nobody arguing point people got covid jumped buildings hyperbole drug choice defend inability understand science, go right ahead. 

Covid respiratory circulatory disease. That's failing people charts. reasoning, folks already path dying months covid. promising candidates though, it‚Äôs like 6 months since lockdowns started, long we‚Äôre talking far away vaccine shouldn‚Äôt overly far off, right? Unless I‚Äôm missing recent news. vaccine it‚Äôll still take get everywhere becomes safer. level selfishness exactly pandemic go years, putting mental health life illegal. again, Gates said wrong? nowhere even close automation Trump makes Ron DeSantis look like intellectual. Thanks. Yeah, another thing learn hard way night: still sane culture would call ‚Äúthe right thing do,‚Äù yet people, even family, would see wrong. was...*sigh* Social media companies really business deciding classified misinformation. I've seen Facebook YouTube block counter opinions, facts, opinions, many things, Covid 19. Speech needs free. like someone says, speak louder. shut different viewpoints. awful lot room discuss effectiveness masks school closures, among things. straight science clear cut need shut schools, yet media companies would believe there's one consensus among doctors, scientists, economics professionals, true. varying opinions heard. everything say really worry people trying tear down. truth come end, one way another. believe response virus grossly overblown. hurt anything cost lives say knock fear mongering. sounds amazing. make sense?

That's like saying died Covid got shot.

How simply Covid mean died it? scenarios. always use football stadium. Imagine said they'll kill 10 people gates halftime. go. don‚Äôt really see interaction problem. Seems like everyone around lot outdoor play dates whether they‚Äôre person remote learning

It crisis kids need school safety nutrition though linked article says risk mink-to-human transmission low We‚Äôve experienced almost 4 years now. Hello citizens Earth! Looks like China wildly competent compared you-know-where. leading *TREMENDOUS* resentment butthurt rage you-know-where. all, equality feel like oppression entrenched privilege. understand feels privileged suddenly discover less clothes emperor they've told decades.

Thus! poked head over. everyone today? still debating masks? perhaps need fund missiles instead? like missiles certain variety. 

Yes. Learn something new everyday. ty Nembro **1.3% PFR**... Damn, gonna say that! track LESS deaths year 2018 2019.

IOW, lie support ideas know bad. Think it, Australia close zerocovid. states literally zero cases, everything open.

And pampered Melbourne whiners can't endure couple weeks going bars concerts? They're world bars concerts totally okay, paid price upfront.

Bunch whiners. Gates Microsoft worked products 20 years now.  Instead spent 20 years immersed field epidemiology research required address infectious diseases globally.  foundation's work large part reason covid19 vaccine much earlier would otherwise.  done help make things better pandemic? Fuck that's what. pneumonia covid19. Covid19 disease classification. 

And 100% correct 100% sheep. Keep repeating lies misinformation like good sheep are. deadly though. know overwhelming vast majority people get Covid recover days mild flu like symptoms.

And people die ""from it"" litany health problems, making nearly impossible conclude ACTUALLY died result Covid not.

As fat old person diabetes died surprise party triggered heart attack.

Did die surprise party? Mink oil preferred leather treatment chemical hats, boots belts, works great. People dual citizenship, people possibility dual citizenship, even applied dual citizenship. people Moronic? don‚Äôt understand. anecdotal evidence coming China, gurgling saline solution throat nose, helped stop virus spreading lungs made symptoms much milder. True. know everyone hates it. Lol Argentinas printing press going brrrr long US learned infinite money hack. think made huge mistake rebranding masks early. Sure, people think masks cowards want hide faces, spittle filters? Who's going pro-spittle side? believe numbers?
China sus. Yes! Universal income thing. We're verge wide automation we're going lose tons jobs. income disparity haves nots increase. need get ahead wider automation provide everyone.

Every single thing said pandemic corroborated scientific community peer reviewed studies.  Willful ignorance people like 211k died US actual good reason. Keep mind PCR tests generally false negative rates 20% higher... Quite opposite actually. 4 parents u count in-laws 1 94 year old grandparent wife that‚Äôs immune compromised due shingles. 

Your follow going worried welll....

They‚Äôve already perfectly fine, sorry burst bubble. fuckwits gathered en masse without masks. lockdown NYC necessary shit really hit fan? necessary shit fully hits fan?

I agree protesters wearing masks. must. lockdown may necessary. high school destination deaf kids whole county, made several friends back then. learned almost cases due childhood illness viruses. Also, demographically poor areas, families access affordable medical care children. Let believe  Take outside shoot all. Reminds Chaos Theory predictions Jurassic Park. what, 7 months thing?

Sometimes comorbities hidden till something like covid brings roaring surface. Chinese bots really trying convince people COVID bad  But.. but.. Trump immune, matters. Merica! religions this, it‚Äôs people Edit: mean kind everyone

Unfortunately, ""without proselytizing"" bit important, think, spreading religion started wars.

No Christian religions know take easy proselytizing though, there's always waiting hook behind kindness, never genuine.

I'm opinion religion never enter acts unless someone directly asks it. Christians, that's operate. statement exactly right true number Deaths played CDC White House pressure Chinese minimising true death toll Covid USA UK exactly thing add around 50,000 death toll get closer number downstream manifestations major depression They're astonishingly empty argued infected streets. .5% death rate cover wide array health problems include breathing difficulties cases downright organ failure. Mind you, aim virus seems cause much damage permanent destruction. aims hurt, kill you.

To summarize, every person dies, think many lives either ruined severely burdened health complications follow. None list locked hard fast, failed. UK spectacularly (Boris dickhead). Okay read rest already see problem... respond answers conspircists. Respond questions, way get someone hump make think, make respond. That's factual statistic 6% COVID deaths comorbidities, i.e. conditions made vulnerable. troll logic people died COVID actually died whatever else had. real logic perfectly healthy there's still chance die gasping agony days catching thing, know late.  Nice. Unfortunately older disappointed see peers understand anything syllabus.

For example lot (smart) people say natural selection elderly people die virus. Unless going children, that's natural selection considered darwin award.  counting excess deaths - many people died compared historic average. seems like perfectly valid comparison me...? counting everyone officially died COVID well didn't, taking conspiracy ""they check COVID certificate get paid money way"" it. co-morbidity, judgement calls, excess deaths. quote actual paper: "" summary, using
deaths causes measure excess mortality impact Covid-19 epidemic help
circumvent biases vital statistics, low Covid-19 testing rates, reporting lags, and
differences death certification coding practices, capture excess deaths indirectly related to
the Covid-19 pandemic.""

In cases COVID prevents deaths - people go testing find different problem otherwise treated time. Less commuting means less traffic deaths. people coded COVID deaths incorrectly, COIVD deaths coded incorrectly. method looks bottom line. China stamped out. still dozens new cases day small outbreaks responded extreme measures appropriate . . . 'stamped out' They're know corona like herpes. get city, hard eradicated everyone football game 78? see sk better job eg. gps tracking self quarantine

I would chalk leadership taking lead, rather stupid fucking technical point. also difficulty getting numbers considered ""recovered"" permanently maimed. dies six months getting COVID damage caused heart attack, stroke, aneurysm.

""Some early public health campaigns, frightening visuals (depicting end-stage EVD), scary messages (Ebola Kills), pessimistic pronouncements (there cure) may engendered, rather mitigated, public fear"" (p. 2)

""***Compounding fears government attempts stop spread Ebola emergency declarations***, closing schools nonessential businesses, quarantine mea- sures sometimes militaristic style, house-to-house searches EVD cases, community lockdowns. ***Some government measures designed mitigate disease transmission banning mass gatherings, curtailing social interactions, repurposing public facilities (e.g., using school holding center suspected probable EVD cases), actually backfired, generating fear reactions FRBs increased risks""*** (p. 2; emphasis mine).

We've engaging fear-based behaviors paper criticizes now. example:

""Counterintuitively, 2013‚Äì2016 outbreak, fleeing actually increased Ebola disease spread EVD mortality"" (p. 6). 

This related panicking colleges send infected kids back community.

I'm fairly certain making big assumptions believe, makes sound really desperate voice wisdom knowledge.

It NEVER EVERYONE's best interest blow completely idiot. government massive authoritarian outreach, that. respected enforced though. Stop bullshitting people. see people going crowded restaurants, organizing home parties time. actually completely agree you. countries don't. completely unreal expectations lockdown, people humanely get frustrated blame thrown Sorry lost many weak people life. best gone.

As study, depression result shutdowns even major factor excess deaths. Excess deaths highest South Midwest, places least strict lockdown measures quick reopen. Looks like real killers.

Also fogging issue buy mask metal clamp nose clamp real tight. Yes, edited.  Took total wounded rather dead spreadsheet. 

Still fact remains. 2.8 per 1000 WW2. 0.65 per 1000 COVID19 US. Oh doubt zero considering nature virus. think country truly zero... even Vietnam New Zealand. Wasn‚Äôt many tbh, well majority wearing masks properly. still need live enjoy rare occasions city winning championship.

It‚Äôs really not. us high risk issues care someone still forced go society interact rest live life crowd potentially exposed doing, huge issue. government isn‚Äôt giving us handouts stay locked home due risk. going blind? Every comment thread expressing slightest caution getting buried downvotes. None posts remotely extreme. top comment literally declaration new normal. yesterday's thread, posts nature posted r/nonewnormal troll give skeptics something circlejerk around. condoning recklessness denial point dangerous. Watch less fox news dude, got head turned around someone China positive break quarantine.... put death, prison, extended family suffers consequences.

They even forcibly locked home boarded up.

Didn‚Äôt realize meant leading first-world country Already has. gives shit testing? Hospitals empty excess mortality miniscule. clear covid problem Japan, all.

Without doubt. zero trust administration produce valid stats. HealthCare Economic. dropped neccessary /s linkable charts -- kind annoying people link picture rather custom chart created. raw scaled population, mix match types data everywhere. best graphing tool slicing data, IMHO. analysis based excess mortality numbers, means excess deaths directly caused virus could indirectly pandemic repercussions, heart attacks due job loss kind death due stress lockdowns, depression, economic collapse, people go medical screening prevent cancers..etc never supported lockdowns **as defense** virus. read they'd want defense all. China created problem first place, last plague unleash world.  work pretty much stopped enforcing masks customers. kept signs even type this, there's multiple customers without mask on. infuriating honestly people sit &amp; complain governor still restricting things opening forth. whole pandemic eye opening honestly. I've lost much patience overall apathy job year alone. understand thread venting apologize I'm tired guys, really tired general public going remember saying need wear masks. flip flop-you can't expect everyone immediately buy it. public opinion work like that. better saying NOTHING saying something refute later Take away people's freedom start revolution. Give people much freedom start rebellion. Lol oh come on. Argue lockdowns want can‚Äôt honestly call sub science based straight face..can you..?

Honestly, yeah ""re-educated"" ""citizens"" interacting way citizen citizens. labour force keeps wealthy running place, rather uighuers exist, mean recognise potential vector. Inside camps?

My intention suggest China good, US bad. observing surprising twist. China bad. Neil Ferguson (the guy England) mentally ill quack. He's definitely insane modelled every virus last 20 years incorrectly. Every single loss preventable. We're spiking ways [seen since 

Today Thanksgiving guidance celebrate household instead extended family. people take precautions follow guidelines, rough winter. extensive testing New York would know much sooner that. father died coronavirus yet death certificate says ‚Äúnatural causes‚Äù.
