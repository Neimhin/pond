Thanks article summarizing pretty well Ah yes, classic ""I can't racist/xenophobic... best friends black/immigrants."" yes, many fellow Bosnians quite racist proudly discriminate groups Roma Syrian refugees, along identify homosexual. make right so. 

In original comment attempted imply specific group people would done this, like-minded Europeans would know taking agree. let ask then, rather hiding behind thinly veiled dog whistles, come say exactly mind comment makes think group involved (other bias based discrimination). You‚Äôre making mountain molehill.

I quoted Tom Hanks himself. directly quote.

You keep deflecting downplaying though. 130,000 plus dead America alone. 

Not many deaths swine flu though, amirite!? Oh wait, guys pivoted early killed many people quickly. Well guess thing now.

Best luck menstrual cramps. people actually go jail paying parking ticket? normal America? I'm Canada never told potential consequence thrown jail. fellow Canadians please correct I'm wrong. Anyways, sounds wild.

It sounds like America laughed every article read. offence! hope guys find stride! serial rapist Prince Charming kiss? T-cells mucosal defenses.

Then again, morning aware studies done sex life female ferrets general, know. prefer shopping online, trip last week went store directional aisles... violators. better set foot store begin to. Vaccines offer different level protection compared antibodies, knowledge. result, immunity afforded lasts significantly longer. want point identical comment +50 upvotes another post right (today) sub. hope you‚Äôre wrong, sincerely think are, you‚Äôre alone thinking that. Mad Monk Rasputin, Russian mystic self-proclaimed holy man befriended family Emperor Nicholas II, became squirrelly Royals left alone waiting audience, poison cake go wine, returned find still alive chased gunfire night across snow covered field, felled bullet, pulled keep fleeing, overrun bridge, stabbed thrown raging ice-melt river disappearing sight. 

The next morning searching, palace guards found body mile downstream 20 feet inland... drag marks bank showed hauled crawled bit way freezing death 

Which say today... 'That xxx lives Rasputin' last year. People got angry started looting setting everything fire, even subway stations. this, over, they'll start setting everything fire cause want president resign. really, still keep waffling % asymptomatic. Good news means whatever figure throw out, reality, kill ratio actually much, MUCH lower that. beyond that, climate denial easy there's real stats refute point.

Any stats given like, hot season snowing global warming lie.

This another level denial here. Shit dude.. retarded might Nah wont. People already sick tired them.

High risk individuals definitely keep wearing rest wont. Misleading headline.

Still voting trump rofl studies show protests contribute recent surge coronavirus cases. I‚Äôd like know many asymptomatic sure. Lots places done extremely well masks 2m spacing. 

This isn‚Äôt eliminating transmission, it‚Äôs keeping cases level handled hospitals, there‚Äôs vaccine.  going walks smiling at/talking random people? That‚Äôs one fave hobbies symptoms least 2 3 weeks now.

i assumed reacting badly new allergy medication given lack symptoms saw post one fitness subs someone confirmed covid mostly experienced shortness breathe alone lasted bit seen anything else confirming thing. surprise... Here's real question protest defenders(of spreading). hear SINGLE PERSON criticize Floyd funeral? 2500 person indoor, 4 hour, celebrity filled even Houston, current hotspot country. hear peep. Cool, would game changer could report instant results anywhere remotely accurate. It‚Äôs almost don‚Äôt know everything virus anyone claiming certainty dunce Stabilized pattern rising exponentially shows anything sets mind to. He‚Äôs quitter even three failures. I'll watching Mexico closely tomorrow. may peak. Based recent trends, that's probably around 8000 tests. problem COVID patients come hospitalized number weeks; make it.

Another problem non ICU areas converted become ICU areas; whether counted ‚ÄúICU‚Äù beds useful information. worked converted area, non ICU nurses took care ICU patients: clusterfuck.

Normal ICU may ‚Äúfull‚Äù, every ICU bed ventilator/BIPAP/High flow available....Or negative pressure areas. hospitals designed this. 

Don‚Äôt forget staff may symptoms get sick; staffing shortage. COVID stay, is, we‚Äôre going reorder entire society.

What fantasy living in? People keep always do, people die, the'll anyway. People stubborn like that. kill rate would lot higher people anything beyond bare minimum. Lung scan (maybe xray?), awaiting COVID test results 7 day average cases start spike June 15th, really troubling acceleration starting June 24th. There's lag expected daily deaths start ramp hospitals begin get overwhelmed, count happening within next week so. hope location asymptomatic patients reported Oh, he's suffering now. He's prison design. 

And someday, he'll prison State New York's design! live Tallahassee it‚Äôs damn close Georgia  Seems like well way that! 85% vaccines pass phase 3 trial, reason optimism, sure thing. Also keep mind ""pass"" vaccine may 51% effective. Interesting weirdly seems drop apostrophe, hey]  research--I researched favorite right-wing talking heads, said scientists part liberal hoax.

/s Go doctor. Nobody follows that. We‚Äôre talking need better rules won‚Äôt even enforce ones have.  Dang, made happy read. I‚Äôm really happy you. 

PS great example/one reason campaigned hard Andrew Yang UBI. Seriously...? celebrate birthday gratuitous murder innocent animal? Fuck you. Wow. worst part? You‚Äôve actually somehow... rationalized justified yourself? Wow. Rodents always bought plagues... Yeah first shutdown light dress rehearsal. disease chance completely go rampant since phase2 reopen said people started behaving like it‚Äôs phase 4. We‚Äôre always 2 weeks behind impact current infections land ICUs. 4th July gatherings socialization indoor businesses bars restaurants opened time large parts population eager get house, things balloon dramatically- along corresponding deaths. Basically, students want continue studying here, let them. 

Unfortunately, ""us"" it? directive ICE. could even get ICE stop putting children detention camps. think ICE going listen anybody bunch *foreign* students? 

The options stands follows. Continue stay US, wait deported. transfer Canada delay graduation. already stopped H1-B visas green cards. another sign America longer open foreigners. time leave. really. like week since things exploded Amen that. one who‚Äôs fucking sick Americans saying they‚Äôre sorry shit country offering recompense reparation. Physical schools teach, they're babysit.  Lol, way knowing that. someone tell America nation AUTHORITARIAN LIMIT HUMAN RIGHTS again?  live. see way many 55+ folks wearing masks maintaining social distancing. store yesterday impatient old man came right counter less foot me. People ages selfish Lot ""sources"" biased towards saying we'll get vaccination sooner rather later. bad infectious disease experts know anything herding cats. Wait think politicians actually studied law??? Omg you‚Äôre hilarious. feel really bad everyone States right now. 2020 hell year far.

Stay healthy safe! hospitalizations decreasing local hospital? concerned small regional fluctuations cherry picked data?

Hmm maybe exists way world backyard. Maybe aren‚Äôt aware several states many people United States; places seeing greater success avoiding COVID others.

You attempt hold Illinois shining beacon hope, fact remains increasing numbers people getting sick deaths lag.

As stated elsewhere thread, Illinois barely reopened bars. matter much want think ‚Äúoh everyone state ignored lockdown‚Äù...bars barely reopened. 

This doesn‚Äôt happen exact schedule, matter much wish it. human element huge variable, need far couple weeks data establish clear trend.

And exponential growth operating does, remain extremely cautious. time see growth, it‚Äôs already late. seriously considered browsing sub anymore Florida exhausting me. lives protective bunker constant same-day testing every single person comes anywhere near him. Notice he‚Äôs never shaking hands going near crowds people encouraged wear masks. hello eat coronavirus? sounds sad. Would oral contraceptives help?

And hope get mandatory indoor masking BC, too. sudden local Safeway consists 20% masked, I'd say. used least 75%.

EDIT: brain caught up. think body may still toxic virus Fairly common high schools, less elementary middle, least experience. Florida teacher without teaching degree (all degrees literature). pass certification tests take education courses, done start teaching (with exception one test must pass start teaching). three years temp certificate meet requirements, do, get professional certificate different teacher state degree education. I'm not. apologize fact money comes first  wonder many students defer. Remote adequate substitute classroom. last spring masters useless semester formal education years. Ok sure, I‚Äôm international student, really want hop plane 300 people 10 hours, come school campus attend lectures current scenario, could stay home country one semester intensity virus becomes weaker? way acting stupid?

Vaccines illnesses short term immunity solved problem. Fauci raising issue Also, Typhus caused bacteria

So pertussis vaccine it.

It's longer manufactured. available kid; got [vaccine every six years. Modern hygiene eliminated need. aunt told paramedic, accident, probably would paralyzed wearing seat belt. 4‚Äô 11‚Äù guy said seatbelts aren‚Äôt made protect drivers small. 

She took gospel never wears seatbelt. gladly welcome Americans passes.

Speak yourself. America long way go fix hurt they've caused. America good? New headline: elderly woman weak immune system doesn‚Äôt cause fatal cytokine storm killed 130,000 younger healthier people. 

Please younger people (which everyone!), don‚Äôt view story excuse careless health. DONT üëè COUNT üëè US üëè high school draw map texas various geographical aspects sleep.

Sorry, managed miss Mark heart wrenching. feel terrible people done continue right things, they'll get caught anyway lose lives, survive debilitating organ damage. I'm absolutely pissed bastards spreading disease, refusing follow guidelines, going clog ICUs hospitals, blocking people. Bastards trash. Yet gyms still open? someone explain logic behind that? What? numbers published easy find internet. feelings aren‚Äôt facts Well, would like think Disney, always mindful image, want super spreading event hands. hope strict enforcing covid rules. said, I‚Äôm optimistic Florida start seeing decreasing infection rates anytime soon. People believe China obvious reasons. censor -ve information let favourable news spread.
No free media.

Japan government censoring firewall. Media much freedom publish well. chicago shut pretty hard mid March didnt peak till end may. 10 weeks least. deleted post talking ‚Äú Beijing never count asymptotic cases‚Äù user decided delete get ‚Äúfact-checked‚Äù. 

The next time he/she spread false information another post another subreddit.

Thank people helped facts bathrooms single toilets. dorm-style shared bathrooms.

Harvard apartment-style dorms could two people sharing bathroom, enough house 40% students. Chile also OK....but, like, DeSantis' car stopped working, think could fix patriotic brave whatever trying drive; would understand needs person qualified evaluate fix cars. got cancer, bet bippy he'd Mayo Clinic Johns Hopkins, exactly fuck told him.

Why leaders incapable understanding ideological fight, understand non-ideological fights contexts, even *medical* contexts?? Lmao Death worst thing virus.

I'll take 2 months sick death every time. people get arrested spreading potentially lethal disease purpose? live Florida, confirm.  Theres way kids going back school right now. question. Home school is. argument incorrect. It‚Äôs lie say cell immunity offers protection COVID hasn‚Äôt disproven. understand that. They're definitely sympathetic bunch either. issue comes deciding falls category ""bad enough"" rights matter anymore? may say sex offenders, sure. terrorists? Murderers? Drug dealers? Users? 

What decided included people possess (whatever consider be) dangerously low level empathy? I'm trying make personal attack. seem genuine question definitely leaves feeling bit slimy matter cut it. hope see point I'm trying make. believe deaths much slower increase time around, unless hospitals get seriously overwhelmed. current gap cases death due combination testing capturing huge number milder cases, new cases significantly younger (fewer nursing home outbreaks far, primary driver deaths spring) treatments getting much better (Oxford researchers recently said hospitalized deaths fallen 1/4 April). spread also increasing, number tests leading cases, portion tests coming back positive increasing well, suggesting spreading faster ramp testing. many hospitals end reaching capacity, lose much progress made better treatments. Texas Florida, cities, point 10% population simultaneously infected like New York was, ‚Äúoh shit‚Äù level lockdown definitely appropriate needed. doesn‚Äôt appear case point though. I've tracking daily changes months. til last week 10% tests taking week get results on. Last week jumped 15-20%. last three days 35-40% confirmed ""new"" cases tests week ago. likely **75,000 tests queue processing**. We're running ~21% positive right that's another ~16k positive cases. knew something know, we've ignored much. Taking example recent news scientists warning coronavirus airborne, like already knew spread aerosol months ago? masks see person‚Äôs mouth ventilators

Yeah worked great NYC. Funny shrieking ventilators died soon bunch doctors Chicago area suggested ventilating everyone might best course action. sucks. Might suggest ? 

I hate even said, though. common decency mask everyone around you. virus scary easy presymptomatic carrier (not showing symptoms yet already infected) spreading unknowingly others, including older adults, kids, pregnant women. ludicrous wearing masks become political thing... üòî Fellow Texan. even real reason battle Alamo. recently learned reason fighting Mexico like ""no slavery"" good ol' boy like ""is so? we're GOING SLAVERY."" 



At least that's explained me. less. Nah definitely see mean. think combination two factors mentioned one additional one. 

For one, bars indoors, virus airborne, even one sick person bar basically fill room virus able vent dissipate area. saw happen lot restaurants, one infected person could infect people tables across room, much six feet, particularly air circulation directing air way. crowded bar, airborne quality cause virus infect nearly everybody inside. contrast, protests outdoors, virus could readily dissipate, especially part people mobile, would really worry person next virus, anybody protest virus.

If people wearing face masks, may big problem, bars not. mean really can't. can't really drink, eat, even talk loud bar mask on. masks off, virus airborne leading large numbers people getting infected. protests, people masks, even person next infected risk catching virus relatively diminished long masked up.

Additionally, think might also really key, people bars drunk place packed. way people 'distancing' way. top drunk people really known cleanliness, like washing hands touching face, coughing sleeve etc. 

I think put together bit clear bars going root lot clusters. still bit surprised protests lead spread, really seems didn't. think definitely good thing since opens door outdoor gatherings masks somewhat viable. Suspiciously cat Yes. poverty civil unrest. Karl Marx good name you. Humans dont give fucking shit saying agree people believe follow son, posted disturbing things. sharing stories anti maskers. say lies though.

You know, masks uncomfortable, breathe. Otherwise one could wear them. I‚Äôm Florida US. feel really overwhelmed everything, partly don‚Äôt understand timeline here. someone educated subject tell long way life likely last? people get top medical law schools think would score high whatever exams required take. make seem like passing bar exam another level difficulty getting top law school.

I'm also looking prestige perspective someone who's aiming high paying job respectable company. whole point going top school networking better job offers, get job ordinary company. Otherwise there'd point going top school considering schools may offer equal education. people look US way people look serial killers. pls States counties public health officials issue public health orders, make emergency declarations close shops etc. serve pleasure executive (Governor, case, also county administrator, mayor, city manager). intended place balance professional medical advice public process. 

We want neither medical dictatorship want political process dictating science. 

It become apparent balance struck creating structure failing parts US. 

But, clear, many states counties working processes. reading Florida, Texas, Arizona led fucking idiots. Excellent point. fuck shit like happening country? literally safety net anyone?? wear mask workout gym. can‚Äôt wear mask eat restaurant drink bar.  slow burn Florida never stopped explosion NYC. numbers NYC bad could've much worse. Also, referring specifically bed capacity NYC. testing numbers haven‚Äôt increasing significantly, certainly enough explain surge cases hospitalizations, it‚Äôs totally dependent upon state live in. LOL!! allowed stop watch back like there‚Äôs kind hit me, I‚Äôm point I‚Äôd willing take chances. 

But, no, realize wouldn‚Äôt anything, I‚Äôm trying wait everybody find something else focus on. 

If anything, pandemic taught trust anyone. actually really helps reinforcing whole social distancing thing. school district planning opening 3 days person, 2 online. ask anyone may answer, better five days person? mean you‚Äôre still getting exposed people every day... feel like amount cases avoid negligible Wow, Pinocchio, nose would put eye, California. really put /s previous posts, although sarcasm precisely tone.

Of course right. 

I teach Vermont. three days come plan take students teachers online. it. students struggle? Yes. many thrived. Teachers schools *can* great work. 

We worked 60+ hour weeks figure make go. School ended three weeks ago. I've taken one week recharge, back it. 

The logistics impossible. know small rooms ventilation worst places be. could space desks 6' 8 hours matter? Especially masks mandatory (which aren't-- far). 

We know bus safely, get computers need enough, quicky efficiently scan temperatures kids walk door. 

If money busing, expensive, acurate IR cameras adults manage fewer kids room-- mention loads free masks kids forget them... could maybe reasonable plan. 

Meanwhile, clock ticking. five weeks. teachers get paid work full-time summer. know working anyway, because, *the kids.*

But lucky: flattened curve enough testing tracing far stomped inevitable clusters. shot whatever design working. 

But yeah, right. There's money right solution. others precariously flying wing prayer. That's happens cases allowed surge, even, lesser extent, aren't. 

Schools designed weather this. High Schools going major vectors, doubt. Yet can't pay solutions need unless economy open. way through. Unfortunately, I'm sure effective be.

A fine increase anti-government anti-science sentiment.

Everyone else already wearing mask w/o fine. problem? must flame China Europe Biden major problem. Much harder get bad grades Anderson Paak makes music There's going alot kids without parents next year. glad choose US country post graduation. Never seen level hostility immigrants US. country built immigrants! Trump literally brought US image last 4 years, dragged shit. American friends, right thing, vote anyone Trump. Vote want country continue great!  fucking kidding me. Please let onion post..... Sounds pretty much like sweden Again, people politicans. one Florida looked North East shrugged off. Florida residents family North East called check make sure alright. Also, everyone voted Florida voted people office. people apposed DeSantis still live Florida vote this. lot citizens especially elderly still quarantining afraid. one expected elected officials put economy human life voted office. absurd assume people voted this. Herd immunity non at-risk population. end protecting at-risk population time far rapidly waiting vaccine. 

The elderly, and/or people significant comorbidities need isolation support (financial/food/medicine). someone at-risk roof that's major challenge recommend maximum caution going avoid infection. 

I 98 year old grandmother nursing home, completely isolated precaution save lot lives community, although essentially prison...

Trying minimize infections everyone right approach. better go maximum infections population endure minimal complications. agree Trump power set tone direction game plan nation-wide. least set good example. 

The presidency powerful ways, quite powerless others. Trump bluster forcing states that, it‚Äôs bluster. screw funding maybe certain places. spending stocking surely coming.. TP Soaps foods meds....... I'm going takes state again. figure month state.

That said I'm seeing lot people partying spending like crazy. country two separate minds Tested positive active virus, antibodies?

And former, what‚Äôs breakdown symptomatic asymptomatic ? I've never heard know anything pretty sure definitely happened really believe that? Invasive technology anything keep safe, rife abuse. Yeah man fuck lee government. yup, 3 times less isnt exactly great either. take Australia pop &amp; case example, Canadian way worst. hear man, Americans skirting quarantine act need held accountable. I‚Äôm asking don‚Äôt jump conclusions based plate alone. quite large handful us US plates can‚Äôt exempted switching plates provincial ones. Doesn‚Äôt mean didn‚Äôt complete mandatory quarantine period. Trust folks US plates Canada since March. They‚Äôre tourists. gyms Bay Area closed. Thank you, internet troll! you, that's compliment Good lad Ignorance insult. simply means know. defend statement. know enough understand lied to. 

Nothing even true enough start. polio caused leaky gut viruses come in? vaccine ""works"" cause polio? would keep vaccinating people vaccine causes polio? leaky gut cause polio? None even consistent itself, let alone reasonable alternative immunology. 

 [Start anything believe, research specifically take granted one guy internet knows something thousand people PhDs don't. research public. Instead saying surely get massive thing wrong, look know know. Wait what? I‚Äôm confused. 

So understand children bring home, live someone 65? 
And understand children autoimmune diseases puts higher risk category? 

So do? I‚Äôm baffled this. Wow spin January. Today 130,000 Americans died since. favor COs able extrajudicial punishments? doesnt matter like not, that's blatant violation rule law care time prisoner punished extrajudicially. ESPECIALLY jail, given vast majority sex offenders jail havent even found guilty yet; they're awaiting court date presumption innocent found guilty.

Extrajudicial punishment pandemic might cause life long damage people potentially innocent favor? Nah. Nah.  i'm sorry inform brain diarrhea ain't 'facts' Maybe change Bolsonero COVID positive. Rural Canada actually.  live neighboring county basically decided follow path Bexar/San Antonio covid safety regulations.


I want man's babies. totally creepy, culty, worshipper kind way. Mostly...

But he's really impressive, he's tried stay ahead thing much possible, despite thwarted damn near every turn state government judicial system.

I hope everyone else taking note politicians shown poise, determination, humanity, leadership ones complete wishy washy, monstrous disappointment. going make big difference future elections such.

But also, sexy af. lower, maybe 1%.

The USA testing way March percentage high. Still stagering number Colleges universities need expel anyone caught flouting physical distancing requirements party. demonstrates fundamental lack critical thinking ability, ultimately colleges universities supposed nurture.   hope so. university made statement since confirmed fall semester in-person month ago.   indoors. A/C Fear caused collapse.

Exactly. fear going away virus does. else new? discover it. Maybe explained works.  Hope recover quickly! Really? start? hardly see anyone wearing mask nowadays. government seems appointed Chief Cruelty Officer every agency. live eastern europe, know, shithole countries. Tests easily available, free funded government. 
The total death toll country like 30 people curve flattened. staying place pay live anyway become severely diminished quality life ? 120 vaccine candidates? Gilead? WTF, dont even vaccine. hardly limited Berlin. confirm thing happening Czech Republic, Austria, Hungary, Slovakia Poland too. online programs graduate level, international students saw campus may H1B another, non-student visa category. (H1B cap exempt universities) empty hotels state could converted care centers. Either recovering COVID patients, temporarily relocate nursing home residents without COVID. 

In NYC alone, almost hotels housing homeless peak crisis, like finding hotels option. 

Beyond that, remember USNS Comfort Javits FEMA hospital? barely used. 

Also, state scrubbed EO NY.gov website, still read copy take note nursing homes prohibited testing recovering patients COVID. get fat, ur heavyweight comment gives ‚Äú2 sentence horror story‚Äù vibes LOVE Hashtag Dawn Planet Atheists. se verdade, √© muita maldade eu n√£o estar triste?
(if true, bad I'm kinda happy?) Hong Kong protesting? Genuinely sure lower turn time. know still wear cloth mask that, mask one way valves.  

Otherwise helping prevent spreading anything catch it. Yes. rather strange prediction makes question article. Q1 2021 much reasonable agree people go people dont go stay closed probably needs die COVID November let Trump self-immolate. son's school district ""lucked out"": bad tornado tear town first week March, knocking power days severely damaging elementary school middle school. next week Spring Break. district plan double two middle two elementary schools half day blocks within week, Miss Rona put stop that. 

I can't help see political pressure pretend ""get back normal"" took school district less week make two unusable schools they've months consider work around pandemic. gonna explain good gonna dickhead  results tomorrow... symptoms one knows result. Unless privileged information. Oof restaurant? I‚Äôm area well bending nation's [infection wrong way. Well, put like that. : ) like hate lost revenue.....

Despair exactly right word see Trump 2 shudder. Nurglesplayground  Last heard, Pence saying would send 500 nurses (I think). don‚Äôt know how. Like maybe NYC got lot volunteer medical people. really fucking sucks. life mostly unchanged except working home stress isolation still sucks. fair quite likely Hanks kidnapped. covid laced flu shot last year wanted prove earth sphere. 5g activated flu shot, concentrated chemtrail chemicals made sick. Since drinking fluoride tap water bill gates neighbor, Clinton kidnapped keep quiet. knows climate change real sandy hook staged let evidence leak.

Oh would love lockdown, followed massive testing, contact tracing, mandatory masks, slow controlled reopening... followed living somewhat normal life months after. Instead, I‚Äôve moving 2020 plans 2022. Exactly consider Flus colds, many healthy adults need flu cold vaccines every year? body handles virus longer novel virus. B-cells last decades don‚Äôt guarantee immunity, fight viruses effectively decades.

Also consider resilient group young children. Well FL keeps reelecting Rick Scott despite open corruption... American culture (at least many) individual, group. philosophy - group manages fine individuals fine.

\^ comment completely false misleading. People think small terms get freaked numbers commas. big picture entirety, ""populace"" healthy right now. .0004% people died USA Coronavirus (137k deaths / 330 million population). Even want triple cases due lack functional testing say instead 3 million, 9 million people coronavirus (that means tested + point, actively sick recovered). .027% entire USA population (9 mil / 330 mil). honest ourselves, get - sucks death horrible, death rate compared entire population even close impactful economy. see, economy solid right even 100% fully open. everyone freaking current corona #'s think populace ""not healthy"", economy sure hell reflecting that. way past talking individual waves. tsunami upon us. cases graph.

Risk/reward. vaccines answer one would been? US GDP 2019 $21.43 TRILLION. real terms, would difficult explain funding options developed faster proven, denying funding one. Besides, vaccine options mean vaccinations distributed faster we're relying facilities manufacture them. would take Voldemort point sister nursing student moved (65+) parents house infect since takes care Covid patients regularly. definitely expensive choice important her.

I‚Äôm Florida think wall us get shit together. people still vacationing here!   Harvard, normal year, 23,000 students. Assuming attendance limited 40% campus, that's 9,200 students. perfect three day schedule, that's 3,000+ tests every day. 

Do believe Harvard University equipped process three thousand coronavirus tests daily basis?

Those LabCorp type numbers. testing scope going processed third party. think going stop millions tourists year. fucking chance. truth sucks still truth. *Pay* heaps money work ass own.

I still can't believe didnt get thst trip US considering many people flight caught Pretty cavalier attitude lol convinced anything hoax money. hoax, think hospital systems would paying big money incentivize people come work hotspots? hoax, think big corporations would shut like voluntarily switch social distancing measures, defects bottom line?

Bolsanaro outright dictator looking use pandemic excuse passively genocide tribal populations Amazon rainforest, Trump closeted sexual predator dictator whose Dad arrested Klan rally, wants passively genocide immigrants minorities, detain political dissidents indefinitely, let Amazon workers die preventable causes.

Can certainly see comparisons would diminish pandemic support taking potentially lethal drug. annoying thing sucked acknowledged would take 8-12 weeks masking lockdown USA would now. EPL testing season. American leagues still testing hiatus ramp-up season. goal detect outbreaks within teams isolate them.

Granted, European league remove entire team league like NWSL MLS. much larger number ""mild"" moderate cases leave CV-19 victims serious, lifelong damage hearts, lungs, livers, kidneys, etc.

I think actually rare. Unless data contrary?

I mean ... world full recovered Covid cases. Surely look see permanent damage, rather relying hypotheticals, right? Cool. Go tell people HK currently arrested free thought library staff forced take books Winnie like.

I'm pretty fucking concerned cases surging idiots corrupt politicians taking seriously. Wrong. Look, y'all, protests still good thing, that's reason put head sand cause effect.

Both true:

\- protests necessary get politicians take action

\- covid cases spiked result County Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer recently said ‚Äúhighly likely‚Äù recent overall increase positive cases related part mass time go back inside now. Well particular vaccine seeme one farther away vaccine candidates their. Since already 2 phase3 trials another one entering phase3 seems likely candidates spending money one would farther behind seems like waste. average one listen. reporting seeing crazy outliers. bigger boats hold water? Ironic company name.    
No vavax ... Vax   
Nova vax ... go vax - nova Spansih means go. understood point, bullshit. every illness missadministration trying force international students out, force schools hold person classes both? Words like ""dead"" ""coma"" ""amputation"" ""stroke"" ""permanent disability""? travel ban stopping people dying though. New Zealand never travel ban. countries basically eradicated virus NEVER travel ban. Clearly demonstrates travel ban needed.

There safe way let people leave country, pay hotel quarantine return (example: New Zealand). become option future. 
People middle moving another country next three years denied exemption leave. leaving country risk us?

Please note I'm way advocating open borders. want Australia match NZ let people OUT, in. High school might protests actually confirmed spread outside quite difficult.

The outrage packed parks beaches hindsight misplaced. danger toilets shops people using there. anything like proportions US. Different effect culture. credibility academics determined ability never say (or write) anything fact. 

This academic record speaking impressions, convictions, guesses forth. 

He career left somebody use something. credibility academia over. Reddit shitty place least shitty internet expect. Half redditors morons Bruh, Coronavirus happened November EU US alerted earlier US intelligence unknown virus alerted Jan? would've spread cases would higher now. Reports say \*MAY\* started November, mean confirmed. Truly selfless person. makes mad people flippant mask wearing person literally passed away making sure people masks protect themselves.

Hero Two things: Dumb ass frat bros Eastern Washington Rednecks. getting worse, march peak 601 couple days ago 24k new registered cases 1 day. tell good bad ? also tell many cases tommorow ? 0 . dont think so, think wil see increasing increasing. faith Reddit restored comment laugh IL seemingly ropes decided bring back indoor dining. We've hovering around 400-600 new cases per day, bad feeling number going start steadily climbing again. show proof claim? Note single study covering 48 hours prove checked side effects 48 hours. 

I'm going line line takes seconds make wild claim minutes refute it. waste 100x time Googling nonsense. already linked everything need realize polio article nonsense. even read come back new understanding take time write things insist science is, like, opinion, maaaan? issue because, least Catholic upbringing, god considered perfect being. Well perfect who's powerful surely plan covid19, right? I've ran people basically shrug say ""This god's plan"" shove responsibility him. Maybe gave us critical thinking skills reason? Nope, spread virus willy nilly let clean mess. not, case lol. trash excuse. downvoted.

Because available evidence shows incorrect.  "" all, takes one unfortunate trade trip Sweden, worst expose dozens people infection. "" 
Maybe Finns stop going Sweden getting snus shopping then? Trump Foxnews. Wow tremendously callous thing say huge fan watered language ""crisis standards care.""

They're going triage patients theyre going pick gets chance live based likely survive higher quality life. data support theory, suspect considerable crossover ""Open Up"" protestors April ""Masks Hurt Feelings"" protestors see now. short-sightedness (then now) *actually* keep US economy afloat truly remarkable. crazy, almost seems like give two shits economy, want contrarians. can't right, patriots. (/s) difference protest masks vs party masks. several protest marches around Illinois 2 3 weeks ago uptick cases speak of. Science education libs month ago, wife's co-worker basically every symptom, temp 100.5 instead 101.5, test him.

He self-isolated two weeks, still. Getting tested easy FL, getting better. isn‚Äôt increase testing. one states ample testing. many days health department begging people get tested months ago tests people take them. 

No one wears masks (except salt lake mandate). Large family parties large social gatherings cause spread. Fourth July business usual here, cities even still parades throwing candy. 

Lower death rates likely lag kids teens testing positive spreads families. Wow! lowest % positive test rate DK far: 0.12%. number diagnosed cases incredibly low, too: 10 lowest since March. 

I sort wanted mark story good news, day dead really good news so... Thankfully 2, high number Denmark lately. days recently report 0-1.

What said absolutely hope get back Donald, could start war. Remindme! 2 weeks hope okay thank insight. agree needs transparency every matter relating this. 

It's scary amount symptoms damage virus do. know blood clotting issues Nick Cordero hearing leg amputated scared shitless loved ones. read people still recovering weeks months afterwards suffering collapsed lungs. Even made 50 hour pay enough risk let alone family this. last boss would go hospitals make numbers blame everything Covid probably likely opposite. wish way get info stick general population hard either ""not bad"" ""our president wear mask"" ""it's hoax developed _____"". People even called Fauci opinions Doctor. went moon now? Jeez people. yikes likely closed another 12 months even mitigation form place. Shorter term talks travel bubbles nations like New Zealand also success. want - people sense would take lunch home. even less ventilators ECMO equipment person Houston, almost 30s male, man I've scared beginning. Hearing stories people crashing fast doctors nurses. Even safe possible terrifying. proud Houston's medical professionals, angry state failing y'all. Given fact people aren‚Äôt wearing masks now, couldn‚Äôt anymore wrong. I'm glad sense regard still disingenuous backtracking religion dig ""imaginary higher powered beings"".

I'm back-tracking all. said, need belief imaginary higher powered order right thing.

Religion invented alternative power structure monarchy, course, one priest could work 1000 soldiers, terms ""keeping peace"".

I live Europe see utterly gorgeous pieces historical architecture, appreciate, ask; build schools, universities hospitals instead? ‚ÄúOnly 1% serious reaction‚Äù

Except 20% need medical intervention decent portion left irreparable organ damage. 


Fortunately point, less harm everyone else one getting close nuts. people Trump proclaim Law Order Whenever there's opportunity right thing, seem done wrong thing

Try PoC Alabama. really does. feels like we've abandoned. Look videos riots protests. 

I protesting several times. Everyone saw every video I‚Äôve seen people correctly wearing masks. Stop lying disingenuous. Yes, missed spikes European countries crowded bars restaurants open months now, insane protests riots happened.

Hmm, almost they‚Äôre things differently there. wonder contact tracing actually support people quarantining themselves. guess we‚Äôll never know! Try explaining logic allowing giant protests pandemic

Holy shit, really bothers people fighting rights. You‚Äôre moron it‚Äôs hilarious. Remindme! 4 weeks library lets managers forgo masks offices. manager sits office door open, feet work stations. frequently leaves forgetting put mask. can't blame though. Humour thing Germans known for. New cases, average.

But it‚Äôs probably still wrong.  pisses comments getting downvoted. People can't even come better argument ""you want get drunk bar."" tiresome. getting haircut drinking bar. should. Literally nobody deserves suffering virus Lol Prez represents America's ugly core: fat, low IQ, uneducated, trashy fundie Christians flyover states make $50,000 think ""higher social status"" Barack Obama cause light skin. realize LA County ten million people it, [and like hundred distinct hospitals?](http://www.laalmanac.com/health/he02.php)

#Just 10 people tested positive past 24 hours [in Denmark].

Since yesterday, two new coronary-related events registered death.


This latest statement Danish Serum Institute.


At time, number inpatients fallen six, 17 inpatients covid-19 country's hospitals. lowest number inmates since March 13.


Five inpatients intensive care, four respiratory care.


**8,056 Danes received coronavirus test since yesterday. 10 infected virus.** think lag, 7 reported today (according haven‚Äôt seen anyone reporting disparaging Americans even though goes unchecked sub public. Yup, I'm torn moderation sub. think great become political sub #8675 carefully crafted comments plenty nuance get deleted. quite random. live Texas and... mindset everywhere. family sheltering place since March 16th, time left sheltering place vacation cabin, ourselves, food/supplies.

Is never? found Karen! *florida man OP didn‚Äôt write headline. Minor inconvenience tyranny. feeling mutual. mask behavior pisses businesses hurts customer arent allowed in.

Deal dont whiner. Well... 

It saving foreign students health... Gyms combine basically every single risk factor COVID19 spread one place:

* Indoor place difficult stay 6 feet away anyone
* Tons shared spaces, equipment, surfaces, showers, bathrooms
* People exhaling hard, long periods time
* People congregate large numbers, place, indoors
* Sweat, saliva everywhere
* difficult exercise mask

Sure, mitigate those, ones also easy enough restaurants do, too. 

Essentially, gyms quite possibly single worst place could coronavirus, except maybe nursing home. absolutely closed extreme circumstances. guy fake tan makeup said hoax ploy him, got believe bc cling him. run fuel called fear; comes gas station called fox new studies see showing social distancing isn‚Äôt enough. saying air borne ‚Äúfloating ‚Äú hours making six feet social distancing useless. think racist uncle billy saying ""*China* flu"", emphasis China. author affiliated WHO, organisation refuses publicly agree virus subject aerosolised transmission, despite public knowledge since late March.

Yet temerity lecture Victorian govt health outcomes. govt needs balance economic specific health outcomes; ideally way benefits public good. Australians believe Victoria done today‚Äôs lockdown decisions.

Apologies, find 20/20 hindsight write ups infuriating. That's Puerto Rico is. 14 day quarantine unless negative swab test within 2 days arriving. Danish schools opened mid April without masks. still managed keep transmission levels falling.  Wait..what??? Pre-Covid

Reading words made realize old world gone. Things going different pretty much out. miss pre-COVID world much :-( Maybe bring mobile morgues bodies piling fast possible funeral might start thinking differently. probably not. Since national leader, settle Northeast Quadrant President Cuomo. mentioned another thread, DC (and Chicago NYC) still lockdown, case count low. places like Florida Texas month opening, lot infected people protests. 

I'm kind amazed seen point raised often discussions. get people think that's good thing. assume means get severely sick later stupid baseless. Asymptomatic mean sick. means sick enough know severe yet. deadly cancer spreading whole body year asymptomatic, mean slowly destroying while. significant doubts whether president federal government even power enforce anything national level

I know doubts. federal government enforced bank holiday 1933. enforced rationing WWII. They've enforced draft, even clear present danger US. Haha, first thought too. Thanks funny comment accentuate that. Definitely. Florida education commission mandated schools open 5 weeks. WCGW No, government sees us people, worker bees. TBF derogatory name non-white races. asterix means everyone gets tested numbers likely higher, double asterix means covid deaths, they're likely higher people tested included numbers.

You correct hospital part. 9 new reported hospital admissions last 7 days. karma offer solutions love young people! Think maybe instead leftist protestors outside wearing masks instead inside getting drunk? See mom started back church (like normal sized Catholic Church one giant spaces) they‚Äôre distancing, closed pews, strategic ways receiving host, etc. 
at first worried it‚Äôs weeks things seem safe ok.

I‚Äôm atheist don‚Äôt get it, see missing church feeling watching broadcast weeks/months.

However there‚Äôs touching hugging anything closer 6ft! I'm asking ""better nothing"" enough get approved. Instead, Fauci says meet certain threshold effectiveness. 


I'm asking Fauci/the FDA disagree this. idea reasoning is? 
This quite good comprehensive documentary situation Sweden. prefer watch things 2x speed tracked youtube. don‚Äôt watch part, suggest watching part [Dr. Stefan Hanson starts 22:14]( 23:10 Hanson says]( ‚Äúthey also back mind ‚Äòok, going create herd immunity don‚Äôt mind much young people infected‚Äô‚Äù problem don‚Äôt see signs, scientific background strategy‚Äù. 


25:07 testing, automatically comes contact tracing according law obligatory follow up. taken places large extent stockholm saw much spread society couldn‚Äôt cope gave up.

Now Hanson team testing initiative [‚Äúthe government nothing; standing nothing‚Äù]( 

It‚Äôs good experts like soun alarm, also point strategy herd immunity. think due critics like Dr. Hanson et al Sweden making slow transition herd immunity strategy Test, Trace, Isolate (TTI) model others calling months. TTI Nordic, European international standard Sweden starting slowly move direction. It‚Äôs shame didn‚Äôt happen time Nordics. 
‚ÄÉ  First one, 'positief geteste personen'- asterisk says 'the actual number infected persons higher everyone possibly infected tested'. 
 
Second one, 'overleden personen' - asterisk says 'there's delay day hospital admittance passing away day reported'. guess /u/TenYearsTenDays calling people disagree ""swedish trolls"" incivility aswell? We‚Äôre leading way do. Everyone appreciates horrible decisions seeing first hand bad get. They‚Äôll able make better decisions leaders competent. Applies Norway honestly lmao, everyone shops sweeden ....so you‚Äôre trolling? told I‚Äôm using wrong version you‚Äôre I‚Äôm clearly not? Interesting. think serious I‚Äôm sure character, case, I‚Äôm impressed Virus memes shouldn‚Äôt encourage bullshit. numbers hoax, death rate hoax. actual virus real numbers behind padded. Spanish one? subreddit responsible would mean encouraging people hugging other. shut weeks said go ahead other, great. Obesity promotes proinflamatory state. kind extreme analogy compare hormone producing tumor; releasing substances quantities body used to. Lungs also harder time expanding weight, trachea get obstructed weight (think obstructive sleep apnea). interesting question. like realm possibilities sure, plenty health issues can't control.

I think me, lot like said post. accepting risk. 6 months much information covid, treatments, real prevalence affects. I'll personally waiting bit dust settle make long term plan.

Kind like button poker. dosn't give enough information eliminate risk, gives enough info much bigger edge trying make good choices evaluate risks. evidence trials underway, let us know. Asians complaining people racist weak ass Asians. We‚Äôre better that. Meanwhile, here's map US counties per capita deaths:

 latest chart deaths (running 7-day average):

 course. totally leadership looks like. surprise considering wanton disregard sounds safety precautions Bolsonaro. Pretty much  Yes excess deaths back baseline = Great. 

But also death classification issue - good

So things true - deaths back baseline Florida (in particular) loving misclassify COVID deaths. Doubtful. Cognitive dissonance strong. First people said old person's disease, care. said first wave over, care. they're saying death rate plummeted, care. Another excuse always around corner. I‚Äôm aware. That‚Äôs system that‚Äôs going decades. point is: remove him, fantastic! Another sprout similar manner learning anything isn‚Äôt fashionable country. Mmhmm heard lashed there's nothing say, ""if scared, uncomfortable, stay home."", ""I want live life."" ""I'm going see friends, I'm going party."" ""I go out, city opening back again, means safe go again."" One early 60s diabetes partial oxygen therapy home.  Bad, bad storm came pair enormous trees crashed house wrecked it. fell, went hospital, got COVID, deceased nine days. 

If tree never fell house..... I'm Australian I've seen one Australian redditor take pride mask policy. needed them, we'd wear them. state plainly.

The Surgeon General U.S. stated Twitter people stop buying masks U.S. effective stop general public catching Coronavirus. 

Lax policies? lockdown 191 cases 24 hours. luck out, put it, actually put effort in, told states territories followed rules. Melbourne, unfortunately, someone follow rules. 

We bulletproof. seeing around world many countries small outbreaks constantly try crush get R0 control.  see way. Take another sub want celebrate someone getting virus. No, likely governments hiding deaths, tell looking overmortality ... think that's enough explanation, since even go poking around pneumonia deaths compared historical levels, explain lack deaths.

So true governments and/or hospitals (deliberately otherwise) masking COVID deaths something else, ALSO hold majority explanatory power. Sad even said know hard time tying shoelaces. I‚Äôm smart reddit corona Nazis. Yep insidious government inspiring foolishness tongue cheek sometimes explicitly dismissing rising cases explanation rising tests. What's difference really legitimate fool person deliberately says foolish things? Noone lied. articles weeks ago effects protests covid. large group people together mad government. think government telling go home cause covid going work? conservative protests lock down. saw those, downvoted hell. ""Half sub"" seems like gross overstatement.  Happens think. quite same, husband multiple heart attacks 24 years old. drove ER, waiting waiting room 3-4 hours (while short breath, chest pain, sweating, etc.) asked much longer said know. told going head home (we 1-year-old us 1 car), said ""OK, good night."" Guess think serious (they'd asked 3x already used cocaine (NO). Well, around 3 a.m., woke even worse chest pain, left arm numbness, etc. drove hospital (I pregnant ""didn't want wake me"" guess freaking AMBULANCE never crossed mind...) time took straight back, heart cath bunch tests sure enough, he'd multiple heart attacks d/t viral myocarditis. Stayed hospital ICU least days. Sometimes ER, depends get triage you, whether take seriously not, cases treat, etc. real what's scary young people getting infected. first wave seemed hit older people general stronger mutated versions virus younger members community getting infected. I‚Äôm saying; grotesque you‚Äôd suggest place yes, places no. 

But overall, correlation whatsoever places protests places seen rise cases. However, clear correlation early reopening, especially stuff like bars, rise cases. 

There's also evidence protests NEGATIVE effect cases anything. hypothesis ton people stayed home due protests (and lots cities put curfews, etc). Azithromycin also cause heart issues crowd Trump's inauguration biggest history. real life? reads like SNL sketch.

Imagine gathering family, making signs spending day sweltering heat passionately protest nothingburger nothingburgers. America.

Younger people getting it, less likely die. However infect older people seeing starting happen increase median age infected. also testing much makes difficult compare previous northeast outbreak terms lag time peak deaths. 
 seeing large increases hospitalizations though mean deaths going follow coming weeks. still hear it, BLM protests equated zero-precaution mass-gatherings, even though [the BLM protests apparently little virus transmission.

The next time dream simple idea, consider things simple.  I‚Äôm saying actually articles talking California‚Äôs recent uptick vast majority recent stories focus Texas, Florida, also Arizona omitting California. think omission intentional political nature. Also articles talk reopening people following guidelines totally omitting denying nationwide protests anything it, also political obfuscation what‚Äôs happening. Crisis hours away ending.

What ride. Right? Like, WWII generation sacrificed much, YEARS. whiny b\*stards lose sh\*t can't go Cici's buffet three months. I‚Äôm saying stand corrected. :) agree sentiment must oppose repercussions Americans exercising right protest. 

These guys setting us back little, temporarily. precedent would set punishing may haunt us forever. No, Asian people care it.

Thank tRump mainking worse india, it'll clear serve rich. needless say poor far populate rich million times fold, thus obvious impossible controlled virus spreading there. Correction: us living masks years. Aren‚Äôt days behind testing like TX FL? Could 2 weeks longer that. documented cases people got better actually got sick sense virus replicating.

Yet. numbers like I'm assuming tested remaining 3%? Wow interesting. Thanks info! Italy median time symptom onset death 11 days, start see spike 3 weeks max, whose getting infected younger people see big spike virus vastly affects older people, fact, 99% deaths Italy people It¬¥s like wants kill old people.

Like kind James Bond supervillain. Yes, countries value communal interests almost certainly fare better next time around countries individualist based cultures.

The former take lessons learned time around far seriously latter. make numbers flat. prepping time. Last week reported high numbers order able report lower numbers week show downward curve week. lower numbers artificial bad data and/or less testing don‚Äôt think understand lockdowns. 


We shut down, reopened, still got high cases Covid disastrous economy go along it. shut again, crash economy more, reopen line still get spike cases anyway. 

We‚Äôre going keep till winter people‚Äôs immune systems weaker? Come now. Yea buds ....we live hotspot ... Imperial County ...the worst right now. don‚Äôt seem listen take joke, people STILL infected going ...their response ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care‚Äù It‚Äôs frustrating. living happily -- several years

With real-world activities table, think happy life many people. probably scale viral load.

Your body probably handle virus come contact small amounts it. innate immune system kills get foothold body, like millions billions bacteria viruses come contact daily basis. 6 - 18ft probably taking 90%-100% less virus &lt; 6ft. &lt; 6ft. exposed much virus inevitable get much immune system immediately handle, especially time.

There's concept [""force prevents completing contract. example, renting house destroyed tornado, can't sue landlord providing shelter can't sue paying rent.

They stop family friends bringing stuff in... cause fucking lockdown dumbarse. Japanese people bailing government time. society bone headed politicians would x10 cases. Oh, we're blaming Black people? 1 3 lot dangerous. also forgot one - unusually long incubation period.

A virus exceptional fitness, highly transmissible, driven presymptomatic and/or asymptotic carriers, long incubation period, doesn‚Äôt need particularly high mortality rate catastrophic.

People turning zombies covid19, can't bad, amirite? we're waiting long-term health effects, right? Like, raise risk develop sth year so?  Well, actually, pretty terrible...

* Maintain level restrictions prevent massive spikes break healthcare system

* caseloads drop level would tax healthcare system reduce restrictions cause increase 

* stronger restrictions higher compliance higher density areas (disease would naturally hit herd immunity much faster) whole country goes roughly time.

That looks heck lot like herd immunity program doing. vapor molecules smoke atomic scale hence smell miles away scale nanometers virus tens thousands times bigger. talking droplets like smoke cloud much bigger. Yeah, fiance also RN, incredibly stubborn throughout whole pandemic. listened damn thing shared virus, even goes way argue really common sense stuff. example, refused believe sudden spike cases could related state reopening. decided ""the wave finally reached us"", like COVID travels overland like herd wild buffalo. asked experts' predictions would spike reopening merely coincidence, actually said yes. little understanding logic, statistics, science, epidemiology, nurse, thinks knows everything even remotely related medicine better professionals things way life. love her, dealing unsafe behavior, strange ideas, arrogance, stubbornness very, frustrating. western countries polluted though It‚Äôs think is. Per numbers it‚Äôs 0.5% 0.9% line numbers epidemiologists.  thought country stupid leaders America takes whole another level. suggest does? We've talking mutations months. We've also talking waiting study, preferably peer reviewed, indicating mutation anything contagious. I'm sure what's complicated understand. understand it, lie? realistically make sure countries reporting COVID deaths properly? Absolutely nothing beyond setting specific guidelines. don‚Äôt authority whatsoever. They‚Äôre advisers. Many people went 2008 recession, took years get anywhere, debt, started get back feet one happened. Except they're 10 years older less time waste, less time future retirement savings grow. actually overdue 1918 pandemic event considering globalization industrialization took place last century.

All bets essentially influenza virus - although coronaviruses become contender SARS MERS. prick! hope able find better place get brews! 

I Panda Express today picking online order. see whole incident dude got pissy cause employee asked wait outside since wearing mask. reason people without masks look angry time get it! 

I totally tell people smiling/not frowning masks. example employee helped panda, could tell practicing good customer service professional cheerful attitude. Sure paid smile, could see even mask. There's lot identifying features besides nose/mouth check out...  makes wonder much dude actually checking IDs covid. RIVM didn‚Äôt, Erasmus MC did: 


RIVM: chance floating virus confined space

Aerosols One twenty people infected emits much virus risk infection via aerosols increases, RIVM discovered.

The chance coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 infects humans via fine floating aerosol droplets small, unventilated spaces normally negligible. However, increase infected person excretes unusually high amount viruses, people spend hours unventilated room together. shown study carried RIVM researchers. it, scientists modeled exposure risk fine droplets breathing, talking, coughing sneezing unventilated larger unventilated space.



""Transfer via aerosols main route infection, sometimes cause problems,"" says Erwin Duizer, virologist RIVM one authors article, appeared Sunday pre-print server medRxiv. ""This fits see now: occasionally situations keeping distance one half meters seem sufficient"".



Just weekend, 239 scientists 37 countries announced open letter World Health Organization New York Times. letter, would argue organisation rigid sufficient attention recent scientific insights. want publish letter next week scientific journal.





Read also: Maurice de Hond's criticism government policy justified?

Virologist Ron Fouchier Erasmus MC Rotterdam asked several times co-sign letter, let know e-mail. thanked that, suspects many epidemiologists virologists him: vast majority signatories physicists, engineers, environmental technologists building experts. ""The physicists engineers took little account virology, biology epidemiology problem gave poor foundation. course, everyone agrees 'better ventilation' better. question whether realistic build modify ventilation systems existing buildings concert halls, cinemas nightclubs, so, specifications cost,"" says Fouchier.



The amount droplets people form, concentration virus them, varies enormously individuals.

The various health organisations, RIVM, still assume opinions coronavirus spreads mainly large cough sneezing drops, fall ground within 1.5 metres - hence measure maintain distance. According them, contamination via aerosols also possible, practice mainly occurs medical procedures Covid-19 patients, removing respiratory tube throat.



The RIVM study shows could sometimes also happen situations. researchers looked drip production seven different situations: breathing, talking softly loudly, coughing sneezing softly loudly. calculated basis existing studies many small floating droplets - addition known large droplets - occur activities.





Read also: Coughing, sneezing, singing... nobody knows danger small droplets.

Where drops diameter less 5 micrometers normally considered aerosols, Duizer colleagues looked drops diameter 60 micrometers smaller. float 1.5 meters.



In models also processed differences amount virus infected people carry test. Finally, variations, calculated risks exposure someone sits enclosed unventilated bus 20 minutes, one four hours ten people enclosed room.



The probability exposure via aerosol droplets, infected person unventilated room, normally less 1 percent. average, infected person carries one million (106) virus particles per millilitre fluid respiratory tract. case three quarters infected people, according published studies RIVM research nose throat samples. Duizer colleagues found amount drops people form, concentration virus them, varies enormously individuals. ""That really revelation. could hundred ten thousand times much.""



Supershedder bus

If someone sits 20 minutes bus excretes one hundred million (108) virus particles per millilitre, so-called supershedder, risk exposure occupants increases considerably. person would sneeze hard closed bus, chance least one fellow traveller would exposed 100 percent. Approximately 1 20 infected people carry amounts them. ""Mind you, looking exposure droplets virus particles."" ""We yet know contain enough contagious virus."" Moreover, Netherlands mouth cap mandatory bus, everyone sneezes stays home.



RIVM-virologist Duizer believes criticism WHO, said take little account new insights, justified. ""But look soberly. spread via aerosols taken account average infected person. probably plays role less 5 percent infected"".



Just like Fouchier, thinks early, given small group, adjust recommendations ventilation, example, basis findings. ""More ventilation always good idea. yet know ways ventilating would sufficient. want potentially infectious droplets circulate incorrectly contaminate people"". remains pragmatic. ""The measures use work. Keep distance, avoid large groups. indoors large groups good idea www.DeepL.com/Translator (free version)  Exactly bullshit. cant circumvent rights.

Must night shift doesn‚Äôt care.  really paid foreign troll trying mess Sweden West, would praising Sweden's approach encouraging continue (while secretly enjoying resulting carnage).

The fact he's criticizing Sweden's approach means he's helping them. Swedes would rather die like flies hear criticism. 

Hmmm... maybe that's Russian-Chinese troll! want Swedes die like flies!? DeVos NEVER ATTENDED PUBLIC SCHOOLS, neither children, grandchildren don‚Äôt either. edge crazy cost ambulances US. Hospital hospital transfer covered OHIP here. ambulance hospital $40 $280ish considered medically necessary. live large metropolitan area lot low income people. I‚Äôm guessing that‚Äôs reason. ""We've always refused service wearing shoes shirt. never complained freedoms. require mask temporary thing pandemic keep everyone safe. Stop bitching please, never bitched shoes/shirt, one day remove mask restriction better place."" fuck need know it'll okay wear mask? accept mild inconvenience wearing one get this. way, trying make equivalency there. Healthcare providers really thick it, since patient population already limited sick people. 

I'm frustrated changing health standards conveniently state neither distancing masks needed full classroom. Convenient ""daycare"" schools provide. Less convenient limiting viral spread keeping teachers healthy... obvious since least Washington choir super spreader event. burden proof proving *not* airborne. Austin says...

Newsom everything well one could hope. It‚Äôs large percentage people stopped wearing masks stopped social distancing.

Oh yes unless involves kids food? education? else support of? support public roads libraries too? fund people's access books use it? Hardly seems right. Oh actually affects count? Crazy. Yeah, infectious either limited.

The still single documented asymptomatic transmission case. Aunt friend who's husband sadly died car accident. tested positive covid marked covid death. cant collect insurance money. kind bullshit that.



EDIT: Downvoted sharing true story. Lol. aunt also happens nurse shes credible source. people hilarious. outbreaks becoming major national security risk.  saying back March people better wake fuck told like happens don't.  warned listen happens them. leader take charge find effective solutions controlling spread covid-19 across US industry Canada relies US heavily us get back 100% requires US shit together. years point seems even there's vaccine see enough people taking it.

The fact mention aerosols FAQ masks change fact substance supporting aerosol transmission main source infection despite fact world experts clearly concluded important mode transmissionÔøº. 

And way, also support masks beginning clear scientific evidence everyone wearing masks. nice see corrected monstrous mistake well.Ôøº never even seen hurricane! Onion?  Well get covid wearing mask.  Scientists science mean entity ""Denying reality"". spikes started reopening, protests. 

go away. get press secretary spin everything win... like, come lol. possible way goes home night says ""you're making difference McEnany.... people respect you!"" assessing risk based health. assessing risk based people pass contract it. Demographics little bearing. Please effective üôè See hospitalized people! virus hoax! Pandemic Over! Party time, see y'all south beach!

Could possible statewide hospitalization numbers terrible make great DeSanti look terrible? great DeSanti trying work magic make virus disappear, he's terrible magician. He's got plenty time run blocks now. Yea. 10% manageable suppose. It‚Äôs crazy think though many people going lower quality life virus don‚Äôt maybe realize months even years. Oh yes, ever get chance (obvious Corona disclaimer) definitely visit Monterey Bay Aquarium. It‚Äôs pricey ($50 believe per person), it‚Äôs wonderful experience. Especially people rural areas Could air conditioning systems making problem much worse filters effective micro droplets? put quotes dont need work test all. We're mighty fine job ourselves. recommend marrying green card read too.  read times noted funding schools addressed. seemed lay ground rules terming ""innovative learning"" instead order open schools. also addressed funding work different scenarios without traditional ""FTE week."" 

I know thought, interpreted it. already limited sorts items. think would work best let irresponsible people can't afford reproduce anymore. Since keep making bad choices. like drug addicts. Addicts led unsafe sex. fault. pay breeders sperm pets. see what's hypocritical expecting people take responsibility lives. victim mentality strong you. Wear fucking mask idiots. time can‚Äôt give two shits Tom cruise thinks me. Show evidence he's pedo tard Especially you‚Äôre motorcycle. Drives NUTS. Idiots. wonder uniquely American thing. fuck talking? virus overwhelmed europe/south america. still dealing it. didnt anything better. EU countries higher death per capita US. defence, I'd stressed ran world two centuries. Thats lot work get way drunk home.

And way less money. plan along. Lol.......Hollywood.....is you? exactly current government business wanted. 

‚ÄúLet business handle it‚Äù, said. Well could guess report waffle technical content filter suspiciously over-complicated one facility changes air fast enough make filter useful except operating theaters semiconductor clean rooms. Color skeptical sound like game changer. saying sky falling, posting data.

Proceeds post article 10 years ago.

The 2017-2018 flu season cited killed 61,000 people according cdc database provided. 16 weeks length, comes 545 deaths per day average across season. since death fit normal distribution, peak 1000 deaths per day, said. 

The CDC estimates covid's IFR *below* 0.3%. 0.3% IFR 133,669 deaths, got infected population 44.6 million, 13.6% US. Precisely range provided flu peters out. Funny happens. instead received mere 1000 dollar fine potentially creating bad situation responsible death suffering. allow people make things allow people call making things up? Seems reasonable. spike cases states already 3-4 weeks ago... would encourage everyone else take stand Trump‚Äôs nonsense. What‚Äôs going fire everyone?  think America may well over. No, called science.  yOuRe oPiNiOn mEaNs nOtHiNg mE!!1!1!1! Every comment section every post exact nowadays, get comment referenced, ‚Äúmuh freedom‚Äù ‚ÄúI miss bar worth drink‚Äù etc, bunch people wording top comments. people try sound super smart smug handle pandemic perfectly better everyone else. think topic given mask shaming. sitting guy outdoor cafe yesterday. wear mask travels regionally, etc. complaining people commenting Facebook pics outside, ""don't forget mask"" made decision take going outside, considered comment. made want wear less. people even mean shame that's he's interpreting commands guys friends, making brush off.

I know reach people like that. He's teacher, wears inside everywhere. I'm afraid he'll get shamed point convinces masks ridiculous next thing walking stores without it.

That's also dad hates left. moderate pushed right feels much pressure change quickly. He's sick disagreeing anything called racist, sexist, etc. People shamed every time makes worse off.

Heck shamed husband eating ton chocolate hid bag. found never told shamed first time. time threw out. can't chocolate bulk home ü§∑

So yeah, shaming feels great sometimes rarely solution. White fundy Christians love paint pretend oppressed use justify oppressing others. lived Florida years mid late 2000's really bad storms (at least Tampa Miami bounced around). Lots people would evacuate storm would change course leaving area untouched. think would lead lot relieved people peace mind could come home intact house functioning utilities lot seemed super pissed ""leave nothing"".


Never really made sense me. Ruling class wants avert attention.

They failed pandemic response, can't say ""opps, messed up""

Can't acknowledge existing conditions like lack healthcare, lack paid sick leave livable wage, rampant poverty, policies ignores poor made first wave pandemic hit US like truck. 

So find enemy blame on.

The best choice China, extension, ""being pawn China.""

The US already conditioned hate China. working class supposedly stealing jobs destroying livelyhood. 

The ruling class prime candidate challenge US hegemony, investing high technology instead happy making Nike shoes $0.50 hour never developing. death rate 5 year olds really really low. I‚Äôd argue dangerous 5 year old daycare flu season. 

However keeping kids away daycare still makes sense. real danger 5 year old brings Covid home parent, worse, grandparent. say Asians come rich already. said financial political difficulty immigrating US China Japan Vietnam whatever much higher Mexicans nearby historically less boundaries entry. far groups go got Black Americans, descended slaves Jim Crow segregation still within lifetimes. got Native Americans, subject genocide Colonialism....

Yeah surprising Asian people average wealthier White, Hispanic, Black, Native Americans. process getting selects much higher wealth people groups. wow seeing number makes seem much closer  information given incomplete. 100 COVID patients hospital equally distributed terms age, that‚Äôs different situation 70%+ 70 90%+ 50, 1 2 20s.

Both situations described ‚Äúhaving patients ranging 20s 90s‚Äù, incredibly different scenarios.

The information provided effectively useless without additional context. reason Larry Flynt charged obscenity published uncensored photo's Vietnam War. Trump agent change...if chaos goal. Well, AZ, TX, FL actually seen rising death tolls lately, couple days beyond typical schedule (starting 12-14 days post start case surge, whereas surges like 8-10 days). interesting thing growing slowly, WAY slower cases. national stats irrelevant, include states outbreak still easing. looking guys comments opinion means nothing really going significant? get Canada w/o Rx. google people seem hard time thinking beyond borders, favourite news.

. . .or cheetohs. Common sense common...

I'm Kramer's sleeping system... Yikes, found post black black crime guy clearly protesting Ahmaud Arbery. Yup, called it. Knew racist. New York contact tracers subpoena people get talk. Can‚Äôt imagine Texas different. huh? Anybody who's stupid enough go Six Flags world pandemic deserves whatever coming way. feel bad children know better parents decide take them. report suggests careful using latest ten days values due delays reporting. least sure R 1. Congrats shitting board thinking won.

When America free open everyone wins. he'd get canned instantly we'd lose person trying anything I'm sorry, too. I've incredibly angry situation general now. post happened coincide email administrators one schools laying plan dealing financial repercussions low enrollment due COVID. plan involves bunch staff adjuncts laid administration taking heroic 3% pay cut. So, I'm frustrated, none fault. Yeah, no. *incredibly* unlikely Sweden's neighbors mortality rates like Sweden does. Also throw fact treatments now, terms clinical practice terms drugs.

M4A undervalues exact fields medicine important mass hospitalizations.

M4A one largest pay cuts set primary care physicians, exact doctors flex hospitalists like residencies heavy inpatient care would get really good managing illnesses really efficient well.

But M4A‚Äôs policies would pay doctors even less relatively anemic wages now, would also deny great primary care doctors setting rates equal skill, instead based compensation largely volume even permitting tip payments.

M4A would left us even fewer primary care physicians midlevels stepped care manager role, midlevels ill equipped manage cases ICU MSU, let alone pandemic level demands.

More Napa County following guidelines seeing huge spread yet. simply focus term ""mass gathering.""

If large outdoor stadium concerts right everyone wore mask would OK? September? doors open August baby! fucked. Regardless findings, believe previous statement needs clarification. LMAO people think we‚Äôll wearing masks years.

You can‚Äôt even get people comply now, number gonna go people get tired it. article total bullshit. There‚Äôs widespread mask use society perceives necessary, people slowly naturally try return normal months go Florida already blue politically... guess time people turn blue Tbh taught maybe always bit crazy going hospitals med centres maskless. Makes sense. She‚Äôs mild symptoms. husband less bed day test rest kids. many one hundred million Brazilian?! we‚Äôre really going gather see another human‚Äôs 2022??? we‚Äôre supposed live happily this??? Italy New York took three weeks full shutdowns started showing numbers. Based holiday weekend data, totally day! feel you. honestly believe son got back February daycare got oldest sick. son sick two months upper respiratory issues went doctor twice said something unknown. gave coworkers went doctor told something viral clue was. Gave steroid shot sent way. losing sleep son bed could roll side pat back help breath. still 2worries thinking it. lucked able get step mom watch kids since also summer break. There's point sending son daycare daughter home. fair question. Covid virus cannot infect mucus membrane, need specific receptor bind enter one cells. imagine cells lots tiny houses little doors locks them, Covid virus one key: protein spike unlock ACE2 receptor, none other. find ACE2 receptor, enter cell, hijack it, start multiplying, take body. ACE2 receptors located cells inside mouth, tongue, inside nose, airways, retina eyes. touch mouth virus get in, stays oral chamber maybe bind one receptors (as matter fact, think pretty unlikely well, infections believed spread directly inhaling people's droplets, touching). eat food, chances pretty good food bolus would envelop virus particle never touch mucus membrane all, gets washed saliva, unlikely linger mouth long enough find ACE2 receptor bind to. Saliva produced chewing also contain anti-virals regular saliva, maybe provide additional protection. food zero risk, considered relatively safe. biggest risk directly inhaling someone's droplets airway ton ACE2 receptors, virus end high chance entering cells. food safest, touching mouth bit risky, inhaling someone's droplets far dangerous. two mutually exclusive, jerk clear, students go back August 10th. Florida one earliest starts school year. need wait September disaster. know. 
I'm simply making suggestions options available. Options feel safer COVID-19 US home country. Options feel can't safely leave reasons. problem ICE policy, college power change it. Yeah doubt that. Someone mentioned above, Americans literally cannot afford stay home sick. social safety net awful relative comparable economies, many states employers fire people little reason all, including ‚Äúhey missed work yesterday, it‚Äôs important company get work done keep germs yourself.‚Äù Even we‚Äôre pandemic issues bad, throw months (or even years) long pandemic recipe disaster. got lifted, prove using license job. did, lost job court time took get lifted. almost like... get paid put people jail something. Hmmm.  parents live SW FL. 71 61. I‚Äôm terrified them. careful. wear masks go take lots precautions many people area wearing masks. It‚Äôs heartbreaking. 91% Harvard students graduate honors. Yeah, I'd agree, fact new York went proper oh-shit level enforced lock-downs halted need additional beds. New York locked well 25% population got infected... 

I live here. numbers come really far primarily really high begin with, New Yorkers good sheltering place. like rest country, April turned May people let foot gas. main difference Florida, lockdown didn‚Äôt accomplish much far fewer infected started, ended maybe1% population immunity it‚Äôs least 25%. 

Estimates 10% city *simultaneously* infected lockdown started, probably accomplish lot, ultimately burn mostly unimpeded damage already done, resulting 1,600 deaths per million citizens (an incredibly high number, New York State country, would two times deaths per capita country). kind makes sick Cuomo keeps victory laps ‚Äúbeat‚Äù coronavirus. didn‚Äôt beat it, endured it. actual cases like 10 times normal amount CONFIRMED Stabilized 0 cases. One co-workers exposed potential Covid brother. insurance child (late teen/early 20s).

He quoted $200 test government funded grant. can't afford work. can't come back work without doctor's clearance. boss fired may/may sick boss care either way. can't show quit employment.

I want human anymore. fucking bummed this...everything...has played last months. tried innocent definition. Almost Harvard students pay tuition, operate different way schools doubt even one additional person die lack particular dataset. But, argument‚Äôs sake, I‚Äôll accept hyperbolic premise, say yes, unethical research bright line never crossed. Whoa runny nose two weeks? I‚Äôd go hospital immediately. Call lawyer draft haven‚Äôt yet too, sooner later! [here go. really sad  never admit sexual relationship Ivanka There's still large percentage population thinks flu.  surge pity narcissistic time wasters calling local doctors county issued mandatory mask inside stores restaurants policy.

I hoping anti mask mom one them. know spoken 2 months. Well mom's insane storage food come handy probably refuse go shopping form protest lol. Better screaming employees still hope would do. never seen berate low wage worker, things different now. can't imagine proud totally ignorant stuff. truly remarkable thick are. ""I want drink"", drink home.

But many people special bond local businesses they've visited years even decades.

Likely known owner staff there. keeping business afloat, one they've created established throughout lives. That's torn local state governments.

The survivors ""too-big-to-close"" corporations. local arts/games/flower stores forced remain closed ""non-essential"" (and go business) big-box retailers Starbucks get stay open.

That's government choosing winners. Hilarious many want champion Big Bad Corporate support thing fattening pockets pandemic.

This ""you drink, die"" hyperbolic nonsense getting hand. complete fear-mongering. go see many people treating virus like joke, ages backgrounds. they're going Target instead Lonely Clam make better. cases best way protect inmates virus set free populace. counter-intuitive works. That's college admissions people got along Trump's lawyer. none infected. states releasing inmates virus? 

I saw story inmates sharing water bottle infect virus. 

If give chance ""Get Jail free card"" they'll probably try take it. point irrelevant. You‚Äôre trying minimize reason. wasn‚Äôt one minuscule transgression. compounding bad judgment. doesn‚Äôt practice social distancing. went large event large event flying plane one hotspot another. 

And you‚Äôre wrong, anyone goes doctor nurse going assume best minimize infection. like go restaurant automatically assume best they‚Äôre practicing safe hygiene putting risk. It‚Äôs part social contract. 

Also it‚Äôs opinion. think it‚Äôs opinion it‚Äôs politicized. countries world practiced strategy minimizing contact, practicing smart safety measures social distancing. 

There‚Äôs reason nurses came NYC across country isolated instructed go anywhere wherever staying work. things become politicized order divide everyone morons running rampant trying contrarian

In short, yes reported think they‚Äôre careless shit California 50 counties. read actual article. :) Stay home, wear mask! ain't slavery rocket science; live dignity intact.  EU develop unknown diseases die. Suspending license child support dumbest idea ever... supposed find job without car? Many jobs either require car reachable without US. Man, almost masks work, locking work, fucking socially responsible works....then us US somehow think carrying gonna make go away....and fake wonder Floridians think? Man sucks, sorry :/ hear schools paid based many kids attend, thats probably why, sucks kids go school sick spread illnesses... kids school often sickness even worse :/ Weird 

Maybe idiots? ""viron"" person really bad depression anxiety. whole scare tactic thing making person definitely believes wear mask social distance, wanna that. wonder much mask refusal people think well we're fucked anyway might well live normally? long term goal killing us. makes conspiracy theorists worse makes harder. Selfish fucking assholes

*Literally* problem huge gay party.  Cuomo's decision discharge COVID patients nursing homes they'd ""recovered"" killed tens thousands unnecessarily turned New York worst epicenter coronavirus world months. right lecture anyone virus 1/4th COVID deaths New York (nearly 40k 120k). guess sources bunch tabliod magazines know fact friend nurse sweden get evaulated. Try living actual Florida......no seriously point try live, despite leaders best efforts thin population. Texas plate driving way Canada? Somebody bored, ballsy desperate. Blount County different. I've seen maybe one person wearing mask restaurant, one moves (except retired people Ohio) could perfect lesson teachers banded together. Fuck you, licensed teachers state. Still plan opening schools? Spend much time bridges? need doctor understand basics diseases. Go watch videos Khan Academy MIT Open Course Ware. shit complicated. doubt brain capacity include common sense Unfortunately america campaigning never ends. really route many problems. constantly fundraising you‚Äôre bound make decisions appeal people giving money Good thing they‚Äôve 18-year head start one, otherwise I‚Äôd little worried. true city, according staff works there. Cases increase everyday, sharply last two weeks. holes offer kids rona gods... Maybe that's show true colors. sadly happens many people can't grasp idea ""Death"" end every disease... people screaming ""Look death rate polio!""  Spread word 40 hour work week inhumane abolished.  time look countries ahead.  
Two microstates one unlucky cluster could put top.  
Most rest halted virus.  
Also, think heck alot 7 developed countries world. TLDNW: Poor leadership. impossible situation either play risky, catch Covid population play safe, commit cruel unusual punishment putting everyone isolation, restricting ALL, some, outside contact, require guards live onsite. Even testing guards routinely still 1 infection slip crack infect whole lot, seen routinely tested employees manufacturing facilities. Routine testing guarantee perfect compliance. 1 mistake out. Sigh.

Got cite 6 year old thing? Lt. Governor: *Numberless Grandmothers must die!* want afraid crowds again. people never elected public office think get make legal decisions affect entire country?

Your chance infection increases density virus particles getting time. 

So 

- infected person coughs mouth inhaling - prepare take time work. 

- infected person one table outdoor cafe coughs - combination airflow potential sunlight along distance presumably 2 meters probably mean fine (UVA UVB effects coronavirus disputed, likely small)

- infected person one table sits coughs leaving - probably fine

- infected person one table sits coughs remain restaurant 2 hours (per usual many sit-down meals), may infected got light exposure continuously 2 hours. 

It's like radiation:

- Fight fire minutes outside exploded reactor #4 Chernobyl, sorts radioactive debris around - ya dead
- Sit larger distance radioactive source hour - ya dead
- Live kilometers post-exploded chernobyl years - necessarily get acute radiation sickness, probably eventually suffer ugly cancer road
- Fly helicopter Chernobyl drop boron near hole roof: kept distance spent little time there. probably mostly fine. 
- Spend 30 seconds liquidator moving radioactivity contaminated graphite roof reactor #4 - probably mostly fine.

Murica safe furriners again! /s Genocide what‚Äôs happening country. Anyone ‚Äúburden‚Äù system fair game sociopaths running country. know want happen. Thanks trump, hey guys fun say Define safe? point still stands. might dumbest person I‚Äôve ever encountered Reddit that‚Äôs saying something entire raison d'√™tre 'trigger libs.' may shock you, lot adults schools.

Like really need wait week see cases stabilize better testing less cases enough.  store poop water truther, reason alarming believe numbers made up, intentionally inflated ""fear porn"".  mentally deny reality, easy dismiss whatever want. 
 
Some weird ideas heads:  

 - number cases vastly overinflated. changed way positive results counted, 1 person comes back positive test, means came contact 16 people, 16 others counted positive well (even they're tested).
 - 90% people counted deaths wrong. heard Cousin Jimmy died car accident, virus system, counted death due virus. 
 - hospitals crowded - fact I've heard they're even laying staff! actors hired weep cry TV playing doctors nurses!
 - told number deaths going past ten weeks, 99% people get perfectly fine. trust *that* source information, one. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve already shit bed, lie now?‚Äù Affordability (and healthcare infrastructure) definitely plays factor countries like Mexico. 

Timing well, comparing countries like Italy surged early, test kits weren‚Äôt available. USA surging far later.

Point is, whole lot skew data, hard make comparisons point. Probably bad put ventilator quickly. Lazy U.S. doctors lot March German doctors took cautious treatment approaches involving oxygen treatment. history nerd, really appreciate comparison! I'm going good chat 70 year old dad tomorrow! What's difference live?

* October US elections I've seen read last months, places even try enforce mask orders. hardest hit areas, like NYC New Jersey, find stores mask policies enforced. Maybe I'm wrong though; gone anywhere outside rural county CA months, nobody enforcing mask wearing anywhere. Even though masks ""required"" CA, enforcement ""voluntary"", meaning expect people volunteer wear mask, don't, absolutely nothing happens. said ‚Äúonly America‚Äù someone replied example France. don‚Äôt know point could trying make wasn‚Äôt it‚Äôs ‚Äúonly America‚Äù seeing Texas deaths cases even deaths per capita California.

Those facts. Sure gets downvoted ""data science"" really matter say want say. I‚Äôd consider omnivert. love socializing, degree. I‚Äôm dying go every single day. I‚Äôm busy, put head work work, miss water cooler talk gossip. extroverted friends seem go time, go withdrawal without work gossip.

Tbf upvoted awarded posts comments dire stories there. ""success"" will, stories seem popular sub. I‚Äôm teacher coach.

1- Show mass long-term effects. national media decides pick out. Nationwide hear individual instances affected young person, almost always multiple medical problems.
2- Deaths... lag? Look live Iowa, I‚Äôll use Iowa example. deaths confirmed cases dropped 1 percent ravaged nursing homes 0.22 affects young people. time, would assume would grow past 0.2 0.3? There‚Äôs much better chance dropping young people (under 50) infected.
3- long willing wait filling classrooms, gyms fields? long mental health youth ends bigger problem society death virus? really think vaccine going end next year?
4- Again, Iowa number. it‚Äôs higher communities, I‚Äôd willing bet it‚Äôs ravaged lower health communities first eventually lead survival rate near 99.9 percent.

Really guys... bad want virus be? know bad is. need look affects death rates plummeting everywhere. statement wholly misleading. Death dropping time, *some* small portion time included rise cases. would right start now. Nice success education economic recovery directly tied getting virus control.

If Governor actually serious public education would issue stringent mask, distancing, assembly requirements. long completely unmanaged spreading like wildfire, education economy remain shambles regardless whether schools open not.

There's also element students cannot focus class parents unemployed possibly evicted, know next meal coming from, they've lost one grandparents virus. obviously important education student welfare schools able reopen, simply demanding path success. Believe not, prisons jails parts communities too. Folks work go back families town spread vulnerable populations. compare excess deaths - compared pooled number total deaths periods 4 years. numbers posted approximate rounded / weekly figure nearest mention taking Week 45 previous year seems bit disingenuous? Deaths didn‚Äôt start spiking significantly Europe March, first \~15 weeks timeframe would serve flatten disparity? 

There's nothing disingenuous - direct comparsion timeframe 4 years.. why? look winters first three years, that's majority deaths occured. winter 2019/2020, there's spike - almost deaths would normally occur winter happen short period April, happened once. looks like US presidents get health insurance life. one thing gleaned recently seem encouraging patients lie stomach placed vent...if waiting one....or even one.....

If dont shut down, game pretty decent chunk population Florida averages 45,000 tests per day, averaging 10,000 new cases per day. good picture all.

When New York (same population ~20 million) hit 10,000 cases day, 1,000 deaths per day two weeks straight seven days later.

And peak curve implementing lockdown two weeks prior. Case counts went slowly surely following weeks.

It‚Äôs scary exponential growth Florida would suggest could reach double New York faced terms cases deaths. Especially deaths serious system overload. New York, overloaded 911 dispatchers, EMTs, ambulances, hospitals, healthcare workers, coroners funeral homes. can‚Äôt imagine **doubling** scenario. one hope age skewing younger, you‚Äôre talking twice many cases New York peak, shitpants governor, horrified recent experience suggests may well come.

I really hope Floridians still sending meals gift baskets healthcare workers. window masks social distancing too? trial phases last much longer own, let alone accounting data analysis collected, etc. Vaccine developers said vaccine finally discovered likely range 8-10 years ready usage human patients. get sense lot Brazilians taking seriously Well there‚Äôs almost 14,000 pediatric cases Florida murderer way dangerous outside someone get hurt/killed? would prefer let countless numbers people die keep conscience clear.

Also pollen allergy common lot people wear masks prevent too. Already 5 cases unknown source. challenge isolate every carrier contact tracing alone.

Will start 2nd wave? Time tell actively want higher education collapse. see system creates uppity elites brainwashes young people needing safe spaces.

At Yale's Skull Bones, initiation practice masturbate coffin front rest ""Bonesmen"". 2004, presidential candidates (George W. Bush, John Kerry) Bonesmen within two years other. Yep, that's right; either way, going president jerked coffin front peers. Great news Montrealers! lot people already wearing masks indoor making mandatory reduce risks 2nd wave even more, would disaster lives would lost economy. know meant say ""sweet pea"" visual sweet little bee buzzing around cavernous space inside skull good pass :)  work fine dining restaurant we‚Äôve pretty busy indoors would surprised. 

We‚Äôre lucky enough huge seating outside still I‚Äôd rather go work. Especially considering whole foh staff still partying daily. actually open I'm cancelling hard Walt come back.

Depraved ignorance Herd immunity I'm sorry. went shit NY. guess foolish think country whole would learn since learn Italy China. gym reopened week ago. I've twice. Working mask challenge doable, although may back little. carry bag around spray bottle cleaner made soap, water, &amp; vinegar. also wear gloves clean every machine using it. got face shield try slightly less restrictive mask breathe easier.  

so far many people stay away everyone. someone near machine want use something else clear.  

We find way carry life may go away anytime soon others may coming well. adapt. think it‚Äôs easy deduction massive protests, greater number people get tested asked contact interactions (including protests) protests testing positive, protests contributing. don‚Äôt think anything protesting, since outdoor protest groups (such mask mandates) also don‚Äôt appear spiking. Uhm, didn‚Äôt know first 100 cases tests available? doesn‚Äôt sound applicable we‚Äôre testing. Dumb idiot never opened first place  implement political coup RIGHT. NOW.

Oh sweet child, idea worse things still go. hand, gyms often strong ventilation systems, helps. aerosol cloud pack much. first example I've seen think safely say that's fair point.

You also look cases since end May. Constantly falling death rate. lot thing constitution took exceptional measures sanitary state emergency declared even move 1km homes... needed paper go groceries go work homeworking police street enforcing it. look graphs say ""that's odd"", answers ""riddle"". people believe China. Regardless ""beat"" covid19, numbers would same.

So information coming China classified as, least, tainted.

Japan obviously lying beginning, worried losing Olympics basically denied coronavirus existed. Yet nobody cares. Moron Disastrous Dump kiss ass.  Exactly this. Many cited studies article say many flaws, like small sample size, low % self-reporting results, contamination data unforeseen factors, etc. get definitive results. think ""good news"" interpreted ""you probably can't get reinfected virus"" Fauci actually saying ""you probably going spontaneously reinfect yourself"". many pre-print junk science articles given wayyyyy much publicity.

People gotten damn sloppy. went socially distant (not other) walk wife July 4th. amount people saw without masks saying ""Nice meet you!"" left holiday parties damn high. TIL guy actually Oxford comment intriguing. mean roast dig. Finding vaccine singularly important thing right now, interest saving lives economy. simplest terms, hundreds thousands deaths Covid kills economy -- dead people buying things paying services, thus hurting economy -- closing economy try prevent deaths ALSO hurts economy. lose/lose long Covid around.

So important matters referring to? I'm legitimately curious. could‚Äôve known!

Edit:WHO could‚Äôve seen! Lol U.S. adults moved either temporarily permanently 6% say someone moved home Covid-19, according new Pew Research Center data. total, one five adults either moved themselves, someone move home, knew someone due virus.

My brother moved mom. safer staying unconcerned roommates. Reminds mental health worker worked believed schizophrenia bad spirits. working field mental health. Bro. Cruise ships ought go coasts. need support cruise industry! Ebola gets here. people link paw patrol real problems police? *Laughs Japanese* commenting new security law essentialy end Hong Kong, makes nothing another province costume.

But carry on. No, they're exaggerating. Reporting lower Monday due weekend lag, 352 across UK yesterday, bringing 7 day average 600. already told world *opinion* people recovered, relapsed tested positive again, deactivated virus left body. 

Which means claim deactivated virus remains inside bodies several months deactivated virus proven last long surface outside bodies. 

It period system corruption used work, getting badly touch reality longer working. agree saying Illinois, worry happen try reopen schools universities, going hard social distance classrooms people going coming living close quarters subreddit full idiots claiming anecdotal evidence shitty conspiracy theory articles like this. astounding. There's different ways looking issue, one resonates ""real world"" evidence masks worked continue work... Places enforce successful stopping spread.

The question is... Why? could something size transmission methods virus, could something social behaviours (i.e. places people likely wear masks maybe likely vigilant measures?).

Ultimately, risk-reward equation. works way, even partially, relatively low investment effort, encourage use? got big shirt, get neck. hallelujiah!! things like paracetamol suchlike help symptoms? Hong Kong province millions people want go every year.

*Woosh.* Money. Look 7-day rolling averages. removes short-term variations gives better indication trend. Regarding last point, landlords going mortgages removed too? America literally failing country right now. AZ closed one CEOs said nah still open would rather send money vaccine companies? cops civilians

This. seem forgetting somehow. losing credibility? wonder many people see types chart think things gotten much better curve flattening, without realising log scale. concepts ""individualism"" ""freedom"" America morphed pure selfishness. Well I'm saying Japan good job. know also want hide thing first, later things become better (still good enough). Even better try southern Australia. State \~ 5 million people, undergoing outbreak Australia borders completely closed. can't travel interstate - roadblocks state lines - international travel banned, unless basically get Federal minister attest important enough need leave. virus airborne previously believed, think strengthen case universal indoor masking. uncomfortable humidity inside mask protective feature, effectively converts aerosol particles droplets virus hit water particles. research Covid, know humidity reduce person-to-person transmisson influenza. Unfortunately ""humidity filter"" effect benefit people since inhaling anyways. said time mask protect others protect ourselves, virus aerosol offers reason so. Well shit guy. point is, hero, trying help community. didn‚Äôt catch covid, could lived cancer longer damn week. Perhaps reasons bit grounded. everyone conspiracy-theorist number sensible reasons people would want take test:

Assume everyone infected extent anyway (so need satisfy morbid curiosity would require going location hundreds thousands infected people line get tested),

false negative/positives rampant,

as everything positive test database likely come back haunt form discriminatory process future (especially given known long term effects).

But yeah, shout ""conspiracy theory"" (or # argument ending accusations) everything conform want hear want frame group people let us know works out. smart people evil use dumb people fight nice smarts really we're middle pandemic people dying. Whilst I'm sorry loss want thousands others lose loved ones anywhere else world. me, simply worth it. Colorado testing worst tests per capita nation post removed cannot verify reliable source.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* fauci talks finds likely, lost credibility might had. People telling India ""about get bad"" since March. chance. COVID-19 cancels olympics, shall win COVID-19! means can't stay home. 

They won't. They'll hospital. shit  matter speaker titled **High Priest** **Epidemiologist**.

Fauci fails sticking facts, lost credibility result. Flattening curve, curve high. 5th amendment applies criminal court protection self incrimination. didn't. People especially Western people told number Chinese citizens escaping quarantine, crowds Chinese citizens rush China Wuhan came lockdown. lockdown, people still want leave China lockdown, trend reduced since EU US also suffered much. really think November irrelevant Wuhan Coronavirus? Typically probably, yes. seems like highly political right comparison events history events scrubbed fit story fact. immediate transfer information caused political manipulation happen near simultaneously events. wearing mask restaurant wouldnt make sense me.  
you take every time take bite? entering restaurant mask makes sense. till get send booth take would make sense Honestly, types businesses wind gracefully, allowing owners salvage whatever cash left. survive anyways. need accept live events likely going away good. I‚Äôm well versed stats-university world. I‚Äôm headed university see upper year undergraduate courses labelled research opportunities. studies mention generally students masters/PHD programs? completed late years undergraduate students? true. wearing masks thing Indians almost 100% adopted wearing masks face coverings across social strata.  


I think country world mask wearing become idiotic cultural war thing US. (Maybe Brazil also?... i'm sure) Thank god Whilst understand sentiment, let's compare mean words Reddit getting spat whilst walking street. 2nd wave newer hoax. doubts America's numbers reliable. early tell whether stabilized since holiday weekend. Unless complete moron jackass like Congressperson: mean, fact nobody showed viral pneumonia major city clue maybe bad test? moved Arizona Michigan last year family still back Arizona sad see much disregarded whole situation. really unfortunate US political parties firmly favor it. read it. Thanks concern future learning. There's freakin' pandemic they're ""What freedom?"" Reminds frustration first lockdown, delays. remember calling (as time), saying trying eradication.

Directive always muddy form herd ""flatten curve"" model, rest states taste freedom, notion allowing reintroduced seems absurd. eradication start, start days earlier.

Oh well. Really wishing Victoria best luck here. He‚Äôs gonna miss state dinner stale fries Big Macs. Even suffering close home seem make difference some. People in-laws church got sick people knew died. meat packing plant owned one member shut outbreak caused death wife employee yet still many believe hoax wearing masks church gatherings divisive issue. Florida Taxas increase death already. check states hot spots. 

This predictable. aren‚Äôt numbers, they‚Äôre people‚Äô: Mayor Nirenberg addresses rising COVID-19 death toll San Antonio

... think certain factions United States would disagree assertion. Vehemently. Sorry. gotta fix it. gonna fix itself. haha no. Covid 19 scary disease;

But issue is:
Just wash hands.. wear mask. take injection.
Just lockdown 3 weeks flatten curve. lockdown 4 months flatten cases. place business shut whenever regardless deaths now, it‚Äôs cases. goalposts move further. you‚Äôll begin see less compliance. People told it‚Äôll 3 weeks, next minute they‚Äôre going follow protocols whatever gets put place foreseeable future.
Just give rights protect yourself, allow us track trace. quarantine 14 days lose income. give social interaction meeting partner. ‚ÄúJust case‚Äù.

I‚Äôm scared measures never end. Winter turned King‚Äôs Landing freaking desert. Yes 100% stresses much. get really frustrated partner tries talks I'm watching something TV, too, can't process he's saying literally all. saying now. agree lockdown, however ridiculously strict aspects. one countries globally citizens banned LEAVING country. 

We trapped here, indefinitely. people countries unaware complete violation human rights happening Australia since March.

I separated Canadian partner. cannot wait unnecessary ban lift Canada let (with quarantines arrival return course). People family dying overseas denied travelling. insanity. native NO, . places virus took hold much faster - stopped.

Perhaps wait see final death toll is. might virus barely started US.

I would add also deal virus months ago, lot less known today. source proves that? Cause saying ‚Äúwell say that...‚Äù without source doesn‚Äôt make statement even remotely close factual happened? Seemed like Washington really well read phrasing comment? anti-anything? Fair points, see mean regarding article. definitely shit. appreciate thoughtfulness. Right, follow conversation easy come conclusion they're talking knowingly spreading HIV, big issue gay community prompted legislation prevent it. 2 month fall season sure. Except press asked joking said ""I kidding. kid."" mean read article instead headline huge deal. Basically they're saying schools must *offer* face-to-face classes. They're also required submit safety plans say school follow state, local, federal guidelines CDC guidelines.

Distance learning also still permitted, submit plan close gap learners distance learners keep face-to-face peers.

All anything new - several districts already came plans offer full face-to-face, hybrid, distance learning - requiring offer face-to-face plan. Last read 2-3 years mutations outpace immunity... CT basically everyone wearing masks socially distancing. see small amount people beach properly socially distancing small lake community. everyone supermarkets parking lots etc masks basically everyone wearing correctly. remember specifically seeing one guy nose.

In NYC maybe 70 percent wearing masks correctly neighborhood. friend mine said neighborhood bascically one wearing though. 

In upstate New York, Catskills, I'm seeing like 40 percent people wearing masks properly. even all. Luckily avoid near anyone part. makes say governor good hunter? want *American anymore. uniquely American problem. I‚Äôm surprised didn‚Äôt spread places like philly nyc I‚Äôm impressed aren‚Äôt requiring masks, specifying exactly constitutes adequate mask. taking social distancing seriously seas parks, boxes ground tell stand six feet others. outdoor dining every table available, transitioning touchless systems, putting severe limits on, removing shows activities encourage crowding (parades fireworks example). temp checks entrance, low capacity limits etc. trying everything reasonable make safe possible. think that‚Äôs basis comment like this. clearly ‚Äúas safe possible‚Äù way thing ‚Äúcompletely safe‚Äù. guys control under. can‚Äôt imagine thing going away couple years. 

I kind disagree quarantine safely. Even stayed hotel 14 days you‚Äôll come contact everyone plane hotel well hotel staff 14 days. interest rates zero. makes stocks worth lot bonds longer provide much return. always see posted Instagram type construction guys. Probably fine covid NIOSH rating Someone read Econ 101 textbook. hope right, death rate ultimate factor worry about. worry wrong, non-fatal cases prove long-term health epidemic. can't state certainty recovered patients clear, especially various non-respiratory illnesses triggered disease. We're still learning daily basis. Trump fighting deep state, know?

He bestest fighter deep state. knows deep state anyone. basically deep state. Wait, what? /s hope least give decent name. Covid one grossest words think of, -19 makes even worse ...can't evil? Well surprised! DeSantis went Yale Harvard... understand Spot on. county mayor (southeast US) put mask mandate effect 7/3. However, county Sherrif said going enforce doesn‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs constitutional, even though is. statement was: ‚Äúwe rely citizens community protect others manner find appropriate.‚Äù But...he elected official, regardless whether isn‚Äôt, doesn‚Äôt actually enforce elected official. hell point? Sweden better US without even trying Lol kids least likely die  guy really wants Covid19 renamed China Virus? Say, private messaging disabled somehow? government country‚Äôs second populous state announced bringing back stay-at-home order confirming 191 new Covid-19 infections overnight.

Americans, government reporting 50,000 new cases nightly y'all contemplating whether attend professional sports events.

Australia freaking 191 cases. They're going shut large areas contain it. 

Americans, government care fine dying. 

And favorite politician campaigning save you. much problem? action take outcomes 2 weeks later virus allowed double rate every week! like controlling nuclear reactor slow control rods sensor thermometer gives reading 2 hours ago. 

How know overshoot infection rate? Alright Fauci said enough, time Trump step shut coronavirus task force again. years, whenever would see person mask on, would immediately think reactive. would bother seek answer treat differently. would think myself; *this seems bit much...*

Recent events made realize even contagious pandemic, people would susceptible suffer exposure virus/disease. So, mask normal. 

A mask normal now. 

We can't rely medicine, leadership practice careful everyone else. people look safety even job ensure safe. own. 

Take matter exposed disease hands; protect yourself. Terminal velocity stabilized...so, um....checkmate? Link ... uhm ... breathing? noted comment yours, possible blur faces still show need take seriously. don‚Äôt justify it. Never claimed to. Haven‚Äôt even heard it. objective probably force universities open fall, perpetuate ""everything fine"" narrative one believes mean technically quote truth. simply says ""Disney, doubt going safe environment."" 

At point reopening, Disney going safe. think assume time vaccination.

Ouch, logical leap hard. obviously think guy completely full shit. wanted say technically wrong wording. Current fresh grad future grads jobless ... freeze milk. It‚Äôs fine. Bolsonaro got early vaccine still tested positive good sign. Hey resident friend, listened, 90% wear masks. almost entirely reopened cases continue decline. think difference start legislation took seriously let medical professionals basically dictate do. never changed stance never became political. someone's desire make enough money live pay bills?

That's way country organized. Work, work, work, if, whatever reason can't, fault not, good luck surviving own: social safety nets, worker rights, sick days - fuck that! system result choice upon choice upon choice, time reckoning come. deeply tragic, socio-economical catastrophe like bound happen. what's even tragic: US learn fuck-all this... think early stages outbreak would surely prevalent communities others. initially outside china people traveled lot eg celebs, politicians, cruise ships bad news. think early reports young people hospitalised much could simply inadvertent social distancing, weren‚Äôt mixing enough. pandemic spreads starts infect communities average age infected drops initial sample representative population. young people concerned early info may distorted situation representative long term. people, can't accept change. alternatively first illness Covid - articles confirms tested PCR. later antibody test know false positives politicians stock Novavax? list real hurts. I'm simply providing example virus getting prevent getting again, getting less severe symptoms. viruses work way. Exactly. one wants work comes Health Department. 

First line Orange County Health Care Agency reported 1,028 new cases coronavirus confirmed Monday, July 6. money countries put towards healthcare goes towards lining pockets untaxed oil barons because, know, American dream something Sadly handful friends live north florida still think virus hoax. truly wish well......  fair, additionally 1/6 unsure getting one, makes total \~ 33 % get introduction wrong (yeah still less 50 % ...) I'm fully behind reasoning outrage sparked protests, also shock help things COVID-wise. bail weird exist here. bail actually form corruption someone rich simply buy freedom poor cannot.

But apparently everything US sale, even politicians. going get downvoted narrative trying desperately pretend covid woke spread outside kind absurdity keeps people trusting media outlets topic disease. almost Orwellien way pushed, disregard reason favor wanting bring obvious issues- like protesting actually care lives, given pandemic going on. 

A couple weeks ago people saying must spread protests see increase infections- lag expected. we're seeing exactly feared, explanation sought. Anything obvious: masses people densely clustered together, masks, yelling carrying hours excellent way spread respiratory disease. born here, native. Look definition. Might.. might not. Thats hardly anything new. wish people would quit using case. first illness documented Covid PCR. sick. later got antibody test positive, know false positives it, especially test common use back sick. Later got Covid.

This definitely rigorous proof. Further, even did: likely rare, least early months, would seeing lots feel you. human thing. 

But difference (and me, cause find thinking too) denial queens fleeting wishes come real understanding danger actually put anyone danger.

However acting virus puts everyone, including themselves, danger. prolongs damage economy, weighted heavier human life scales. Suck one, herd immunity deniers! put everyone jail! situation human beings close proximity chance spreading virus. 

You can‚Äôt bargain it. doesn‚Äôt respond political statements, viruses.

Not sure surprise. children...the teachers, custodial artists, families likely exposed classroom schooling. However, debate black white people making be...as much hate idea wide open schools pandemic; good developmental reasons (both biologically socially) kids schools. Parents also need work feed families.

All America's biggest flaws highlighted pandemic, lack education country really starting come forefront. Continuing deprive children important developmental milestones continue make problem worse going forward. I'm saying opening schools answer problems, take desire open schools face value, complicated issue dealt scale before.

IMO, lack of/poorly funded education gotten us climate deniers, anti-vaxxers, flat earthers, 'shed maskers', fake newsers chickens coming home roost. hanging person? say said that, stating something.  Sad night watching live happened.  Anyone else turn family gatherings went 4th July parties? supposes join parents celebrate brothers birthday, already risk still work, went party 100+ people mad want wait see show symptoms. say distanced, believe them, saw pictures one wearing mask. outside, I'm convinced still makes safe. I'm America freedoms /s Lol 2036. people already infected lmao. Herd immunity occur. schools too? Late August going beginning apocalypse thinks social distancing done correctly elementary schools.

Many elementary schools going attempting maintain 6 ft 30 students, despite fact physically impossible fit many classroom. can‚Äôt change selection 18 weeks. Get used Christmas shopping mask kids! still going Chinese version hill people let kids play guano like Play-Doh. progressive cousin Billy comes home visit big city, gets sick flies internationally. really. Building maintenance, grounds upkeep, salaries, benefits, etc. costs don‚Äôt shrink.  gonna hard time justifying ""kung virus"" defense SEEN public education system? Death cult. like Pok√©mon Gym. knows one day time.

Perfectly said! HVAC technician calm fears. I've never seen apartmen/condo building share like this. would far many issues smells noise. apartments individual units/fan coils/heat pumps. Common areas recirculate generally larger buildings running 100% OA think certain countries left first wave, others still first wave. California. Hundreds people trying leave permanently denied multiple times. Seems entirely depend person assessing application day. 

New Zealand successful Asian countries allowing people leave come back, done. Aus also letting planeloads foreign students soon. becoming increasingly obvious $$$ strategy keep us country, public health issue. BLM protesters responding fact police rioting. No, fault.

If police could act reasonably protests. explained over, over, over, over.

Deaths lag. god purposefully reading?

Deaths (and really everything now) lag.

Do know word ‚Äúlag‚Äù means?

Oh wait, blame protests despite multitude studies posted sub prove protests aren‚Äôt problem. means you‚Äôre another ‚Äúdenier‚Äù shouldn‚Äôt wasting time. many find eliminate. 

Criminalize going caves one admit going caves. 

Around people go tubing rivers hot days go hide caves. 

If managed block human access caves cover people killing bats bats bumble houses. bats excrete fruits trees on. Um, no. inflated

He's even actively researching virus, reads doctor's research repeats information.

People like worship whoever see TV ignoring thousands faceless doctors work finding vaccine. means small minded dont get bigger picture. Obviously easy correct thing would talk, seems unconstitutional would like think visible disease would get visible response...from everyone.

A part agrees you... can't understand 130k dead 4 months US loud clear everyone. society gotten stupider. Ok probably right word but, really quit paying attention started eating whatever shit put plate. feel bad alot us. Wtf. Like looked Google something sounds fishy Google look up. Gather information make informed decision. Society that. that. Facebook drama neighbors screwing around something. sad. Yes! UK PM decided pubs, bars restaurants opening important people‚Äôs health. social media weekend, saw people flock pubs (sans mask) they‚Äôd never seen one before. It‚Äôs APPALLING it‚Äôs slap face died horrible illness. got nothing ""human"" everything greed, politics (I'm sorry say) american culture. I'm Canada, tests free generally available get place them. federal provincial governments protecting workers fired need isolate even might COVID-19. federal government gave everyone $2000 month 16 weeks anyone work COVID eat, pay rent, etc. closed open things numbers new cases low.

And know Canada's perfect, response could better. I'm trying start anything - love USA, I'm feeling sad folks running country even employers would leave fellow Americans high dry. simply can't comprehend makes sad. know pandemic driven presymptomatic cases..?

I deal data. care much headlines. mortality rate way US countries figure starts rising dramatically I'm bothered covid respiratory virus. high risk I've pneumonia times pulmonologist told I've probably already covid worried based current numbers. wear mask never unless operating room. 

I wuhan september left china november stayed touch researchers there. None 100% certain happened suspect someone fucked up. 

The spread virus subsequent strains even. Japan climate land area similar New York State population six times higher. Japan really bother lock they've 1000 deaths compared NY's 32k+ deaths. may say, ""Oh japanese wear masks religiously, somewhat true typically twice number annual flu deaths pneumonia deaths compared US. Four times italy 2nd oldest population world. Belgium highest death rate world, twice US. went lockdown March why?

Wearing masks staying inside temperature reduce virus spread cost people's mental condition economy felt many years. We've learned live flu colds perhaps learn live covid. ok lock hotspots dumb lock healthy people. Australia 3000 suicides every year far 103 deaths total CV. many people taken lives locked worth deaths. joke, public universities designed funded publicly. Funding cut repeatedly years point small fraction budgets publicly funded. anyone wonders college become expensive, reason. go doctor Covid anxiety problems considered necessary visit?  NYC resident here. 

Exactly. hit peak WEEKS full lockdown.

I imagine glad it‚Äôs gonna get ‚Äúdenier‚Äù states. Yup. Got like 400 million doses different vaccines planned end December... sarcastic Funnily enough one best things wearing masks enclosed spaces smell ewww deodorants anymore. Except winery course , since Sonoma isn‚Äôt risk.  Uh, no, know exactly important is. right wing wants universities didappear. get milk part cow freezer.

Yet comment ""rich white Europeans"" invented false innovations evil done people chasing riches new world. 

They used superior technology firepower exploit natives later Africans. 

Additionally, consumption tobacco sugar driven rich people economies scale created plantations made goods accessible masses. 

Thats drove demand slaves larger plantations, think rich aristocrat consuming 10 pounds day sugar?

It seems problem accepting human corrupted evil, ""rich white Europeans"" appear somehow especially evil. used entire sample, investigation possible. ""chuan jian guo.""

""I seen before?"" - Whats actual meaning? close another shutdown? keep feeling back quarantine October. Trudeau bad mean trump good. American hospitals privatized. filming inside intellectual property. want anything inside released, guess what, hospitals make money.

Too weak contain virus, despite authoritarian state knows everyone's location, enacting strictest lockdown we've seen far.

Yet strong, news ""cover-up"" even escape borders.

Nor virus late matter - everyone Hong Kong Vietnam South Korea Taiwan seemingly ""covering"" China. Gotta love that. Governor DeathSentence, you‚Äôve Super Bowl, do? anyone know getting tested second time works? got tested believe June 16th negative. went back work June 22nd although county-wide mandate masks required, 1/5 company actually wearing masks work.

I routine check doctor yesterday temperature checked 4 times low grade fever time. doctor air referring get tested again, wrote note self-isolate work home. symptoms even realize fever, fine isolating. However, manager said work home get tested again... guess expecting doctor end ordering test me.

Any advice here? Sometimes wish virus made grow black pores puss way people would really stay inside. People would stay locked down... lot Asian countries done well - hope learn example future. survivors care about; much immunity recovery confers, consequences herd immunity efficacy vaccines -- things **all** care about.

I'm denying survivors' suffering wish speedy recovery, recurring symptoms replication, that's good news means they're spreading virus. Damnit, wish Fl would same. nOoOo, Ron DeSantis like ‚ÄúLETS PUT CHILDREN BACK SCHOOL IMMEDIATELY‚Äù ‚ÄúCOVID?? *cough* COVID??‚Äù people wearing masks

Look videos riots protests. People half-arse wearing crummy masks, provide minimal protection people literally screaming chanting. wanna know places currently seeing spikes? Cities opened bars, restaurants indoor gathering places.

Yes, missed spikes European countries crowded bars restaurants open months now, insane protests riots happened. 

Get serious -- virus care chanting soccer game chanting racial justice.

This kind crazy thinking Americans 3 million cases Europeans East Asians back almost-normal life. 

Try explaining logic allowing giant protests pandemic German Japanese person listen quickly laugh. Yup! Although dutch general would appalled mijn basisscholen kennis van Nederlands.

Sweden‚Äôs ongoing crime epidemic slams headfirst coronavirus epidemic results predictable: one makes worse. Well, least seems like cornavirus putting squeeze criminals making resort shoplifting anyway. 

There‚Äôs also increase [organized crime trying take advantage coronavius support money]( I‚Äôve also heard social media increased attempts door-to-door scams, identity theft, etc. #Translation:
Merchants' exposure theft, threats, violence fraud increased coronavirus pandemic. proportion threatening situations doubled compared previous survey. Swedish Trade Security Index rises 16 percentage points, 55 percent. highest level since start survey 2018.

#The security index increases 16 percentage points

The Swedish Trade Security Index, summarizes stores' crime exposure, increases 16 percentage points last survey, 55 percent.

This 14 percentage points higher corresponding period last year highest figure measured since start survey 2018. index 55 percent means every trader exposed crime lately.

- Many trading companies testify upturned tone visitors threatening violent. Political efforts support companies fight crime cannot take pause corona pandemic. planned ban access store needs pushed soon possible, says Per Geijer .

The proportion traders exposed fraud increasing previous survey. Nearly 3 10 (28%) traders state defrauded past month, among things, incidence fake 500 notes increased. Residents limited certain number hours. Nurses - legal limits!

I didn‚Äôt know this, I‚Äôm depressed. surprised, still depressed. Thanks posting it. (That sounds snarky, glad know more.) sure you‚Äôre downvoted, you‚Äôre right. It‚Äôs polarized people making seem. We'll wait till pack classrooms they're breathing air days end get huge viral load.

Most rest Australia eliminated virus. gone finding hotel quarantine. live case community spread since April 11. wonder still lockdown, less infected people crowds. Whereas Texas, started reopening (without safety measures like masks) almost month protests, people seeding US well way earning distinction *land free...and truly stupid*.

I live rather conservative part Scottsdale. It‚Äôs crazy many ‚Äúprivileged‚Äù young people see wear masks. I‚Äôm one wears mask take trash anything.

Another thing article is: makes *news* Finland one case discovered certain areas days. Overall, Finland done quite well. sucks, man. hope come senses stay safe share sentiment. 

Enough fucking boomers already. Sure we'll lose asthmatics granny's papaws gotta go. Quarantine at-risk concerned masses us clearly bothered geriatric empathy.

Shit stupid. experts tell us gatherings people wear masks (e.g. bars clubs) led spikes covid cases, gatherings people **do** wear mass (e.g. demonstrations racism) negligible effects coivd cases. 

So ensure students teachers wearing masks, enough keep everybody safe? Yes. drive home see many people about. park always packed. empathy starting wane. strong mask mandates get-go, day age information legitimately obtained internet, ZERO excuse stupidity. cannot know Dr. Fauci specifically referring would suggest means coronavirus' tend mutate rather rapidly virus one year rather quickly (within years) becomes something different immunity due vaccine drops.

Several corona infections reported Lapland, origin estimated Sweden. authorities closely monitoring situation.


The regional government agencies Lapland Northern Finland closely monitoring effects corona pandemic Finland's neighboring areas. disease situation worsens, local government municipalities reintroduce restrictions curb epidemic locally.


The Communicable Diseases Act allows local authorities use range remedies applied whole Finland spring. disease situation northern Sweden particular worrying Finland. Within two weeks, five coronary infections diagnosed Lapland, estimated originate Sweden.


If necessary, restrictions reinstated little day days. Regional Chief Physician Sari Kemppainen Lapland Regional State Administrative Agency says although situation currently control, direction look good.


- direction, course vigilant. all, takes one unfortunate trade trip Sweden, worst expose dozens people infection.


However, according Kemppainen, concrete indicators epidemic worsened much restrictions imposed. situation therefore constantly monitored.


#Tests even mild symptoms


Authorities urge receiving symptoms suggestive corona apply testing low threshold. Kemppainen emphasizes citizens' responsibility.


- worth thinking carefully reasons travel. However, decide travel, **there still guideline returning Sweden Finland, quarantine 14 days**, Kemppainen reminds.


Dozens new coronavirus infections recorded northern Sweden first part week. forty infections recorded yesterday alone.

Not people wearing masks. you‚Äôre claiming true we‚Äôd seeing huge spikes across NYC cities saw large-scale protests, we‚Äôre not. 

You wanna know places currently seeing spikes? Cities opened bars, restaurants indoor gathering places. 

Anyway, I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm discussing science moron like you. would guess assuming every single one people locked down, could easily blow numbers 100+ time. well cells, memory B cells, I‚Äôve done A-level biology even know antibodies don‚Äôt stay blood, takes somewhat long (but quicker first infection) amount time mount second immune response... get antibody test straight infection, great. 2 months tell anything least UK people don‚Äôt know don‚Äôt know immune response... talking increase amongst police force actively wearing masks actively engaging protestors also likely wear masks time also interact public average person. There's lot article taking one sentence misrepresent even about. someone handles contact tracing efforts entire area state, noticed increase protests connections protests. people going church family gatherings. Inside. Good. Shut vaccine. small step one right direction. need impose harsher lockdowns. Take biology class ‚Äúhoax‚Äù part people saying death numbers greatly exaggerated infection rates high we‚Äôre ‚Äútoo much testing.‚Äù

In reality we‚Äôre enough testing death totals definitely significantly higher. plenty words.... would get deleted quick lol Keep shit side border though Imagine believing China numbers...

I guess also believe Three Gorges Dam isn‚Äôt flooding... Every time see post Texas, think Redditor (have *no* clue was, recall dismissive comment) month ago calling everyone sub bunch ""doomers"" bragging case numbers Dallas/Fort Worth dropping quickly. reading this, buddy, hope staying safe (seriously). say that. put words mouth. Ok doc 2 weeks always fallacy. takes 4-5 weeks surge show event.  first people get virus event, pass tom ore pass more.  4th generation virus event happens 4-5 weeks after.  Deaths start pile 2-3 weeks that.  

more importantly,  death negative outcome. worse things death. die, mean virus fun games. OP written misleading

Outbreak risks second wave, threatens economic recovery Nothing wrong said. Yes, I've seen studies SARS MERS back January news, WHO, CDC telling virus can't spread asymptomatically, need masks, still flying planes China like big deal. remember idea virus serious SARS, massive infection rate. Fortunately, data I've seen far indicate massive disaster expected. serious bug, something manage opinion without drastic measures.

I honestly think LOT 18-40 crew walk away unscathed, conservatively speaking, yes, group fine. even think lot 70+ elderly walk away unscathed, fact matter people, Americans particular, take poor care health virus like pretty serious lot people, understand people coming from. spite poor health, simply see enough data suggesting much risk greater ""working age"" population.

All said, think encouraged take risks long working way towards herd immunity, herd actually protects people risk (assuming isolated course meantime). Trying delay infection indefinitely everyone prolongs pain, particularly at-risk looking purgatory next year minimum, would suggest risking infection immune systems strongest summer order protect weak.

I'll apologize rant. happens ""Florida Man"" elected governor. EU bad US comes masks, UK rate fucking terrible. Stop buying reddit echo chamber. Lel Stands reason use TWO hands, cut time six months!!! helping hands friends, cut week! I'm clever! conditions mean to, plan. early adopter masks, social distancing, lockdowns. Started beginning March, based assessment information available. Authorities saying masks effective point, completely ignored. 

My hope vaccine available within year now. I'm holding for. I'm grating idea going longer, consider good chances society whole going longer. seems reasonable... I'm already $800 planned $1600 home gym... Can't stop now... Lol Smh, Lousiana we're rising. 1100 cases yesterday. I'm sure we're gonna 1500-2000 tomorrow. we'll continue like virus isnt real. Could also potential side effects vaccine? Nope

Not sure people get this, can't get around reading. Honestly, love Disney wouldn‚Äôt attend theme park free days. 

Besides, think using restrooms there. sure socially distanced lines work bunch kids crying pee? Still deaths?

We sat lobby covid patients seen admitted. So, none us life threatening, county 60k population 2 hospitals, norm.
The E.R. doctor treated son candid apologetic situation. Truly can't imagine would like serious problem treated.

Honestly, doctor's whole face body filled bone deep weariness, wanted take home tuck bed like boys. beyond that, sort exhaustion asking disaster, matter much training he's had.

So fairly minor, still bad enough, definitely see could get even worse. fills hospitals because.... um, work exactly? hell CDC this?

CDC issued guidance regarding nursing homes COVID.

Governor Cuomo [chose guidance spent weeks scapegoating blame everyone else himself.

Cuomo also politicized policy failure, mandated unilaterally via Executive Order signature it, claiming journalists inquire massive fuck-up partisans scoring points Trump.

And now, Buffalo News perfectly put it: [Cuomo agency report: Cuomo policy blame nursing home Dude I'm well conditioned, I've working long time

Or think I'm talking one breathing masks existed COVID Coincidentally, US citizens 'no doubt' DeSantis complete moron. Masks stop smells gas. People would cluster together wherever smell weakest.  hell reasoning post? Ask gym get them, and/or buy them.

Edit: Cannot type late night can't suspend rent mortgages months without absolutely tanking economy. even question, going happen. See above. Everyday someone makes exact comment did, get downvoted, too. weeks now.

This whole thing like mix living matrix, alternate universe, Groundhog Day rolled one. sure I‚Äôm downvoted right minds thinks life going back way this? many systems shifted permanently. Look job loss - many jobs coming back? many replaced tech/automation? 

Work home, e-commerce/consumer behavior, wealth inequality, widespread trauma, telehealth, faith institutions, etc 

So much lives touched much forever shifted I'm playing situation let's look infectious cases here. finished COVID two weeks ago mild symptoms. Two years ago appendicitis work. best walk outside catch taxi hospital. big city. Went ER wait 5 hours seen operated on.  give combination morphine vicadin IV able sit down.  reason long wait due higher priority patients - Chicago - reason gunshot victims Mondays, people cardiac issues also prioritized me.  Fast forward present day. walked COVID said breathing issues, I'd hospitalized immediately. I'm downplaying situation in.  extremely unpleasant me, stayed home.  many people hospitalized actually need there?  doubt people underlying conditions serious reactions well may require hospitalization.  country every year people go hospital feeling sick often non life threatening.  looked many people really required hospitalization vs many hospitalized, I'd bet money see significant disparity could manage process, hospitals overrun would somewhat manageable situation.  

All say Newsom shut California again. can't knows that.  ""It's outside""? ever Disney ride? threads seem riddled almost religious like beliefs, differing viewpoint pandemic don‚Äôt conform condemned attacked, want force side accept nothing less.

They claim listen science, ever changing, yet refuse acknowledge different viewpoint they‚Äôre told otherwise. pro-China unbelievable. Architects? others Froland? thought believe here: remember back February starting worry Covid USA, talking coworkers it. One said wife nurse wasn‚Äôt worried going like flu. haven‚Äôt followed whether changed mind. Denial powerful also scary see. I‚Äôm sorry losses. all. see nothing US news regarding violence. EU censors entertainment degree. news reporting. 

You saw 0 dead soldiers, 0 bloody bodies US. coverage banned pentagon. violation would remove media outlet whole war. Asians treated great. treated quite horrifically actually. Slaves railroads, forced internment camps, couldn‚Äôt get loans, forced congregate neighborhoods, etc. Even today underrepresented media entertainment, lack special scholarships, get better scores everyone else get college. worked asses get today. management allowing one coworkers come quarantine early (his roommate got it) come back work around customers/associates generally idea even reason. people wonder it‚Äôs still spreading    seem like transmissible brief encounters unless someone coughs sneeze right you.. ‚ÄúI'm sure even skeptical people would give wearing mask could personally see happens don't.‚Äù

Have spent much time US? I‚Äôm guessing statement. biggest problem matter well states (in myself), still heavily connected states. never anything cross state quarantine advisory. time Florida Texas badly, opening back here. Inevitably spread either what's left here, state visitors. would guess bounces back forth across country different regions exploding month open up. strongly disagree assessment nationwide vaccine available till 2022. pandemic bad people dying en mass next two years, whoever charge going utilize power federal government increase manufacturing vaccine matter is. idea sit vaccine company toils away one manufactoring plant laughable. Texas way. came New England, country *not* height outbreak (and anyone else US even know PEI there?). must good enough reason get past border security.

Anyway, scare quotes make look like article going tell something scary him, actually says nothing useful. Smart.  wish ‚Äúbusy‚Äù life does. Commenting reddit 10 hours day. hand, put there. They're getting exactly leadership voted for.  


Shame people voted other, responsible candidates, though. comes dead soldiers...

When‚Äôs last time you‚Äôve seen image dead American soldier battleground? Easy Hitler, that‚Äôs dangerous road go down. America, China. sure treatments got better, doesnt mean alot people wont left serious health effects rest life. many Americans stupid? Magical thinking helluva drug. one hold accountable critical thinking, believe whatever suits mood. hope  really think get rid ""asymptomatic"" term. people show signs lung damage CT even though asymptomatic per several researches. saying cases asymptomatic, people everywhere take lightly regularly break rules wear masks ""it harm us"". Meh, seems like long block Americans they'll need ok. right! 

I quick estimate top head, shown 12% June 23 numbers link provided. following two weeks difference halved.

It's good see Sweden numbers finally approaching zero. auto mod bullshit think big oil pumping money *covid hoax* false narrative, time sides vulnerable they'll automatically believe anything negative other. suggest never go doctor then. really believe Forland ALONE responsible, like Tegnell alone responsible?! Germany delayed surgery treatment too.

No, necessary happening globally including places like Canada. 

Got it, countries add shithole-list guess. Holy shit actually say that?! Wth problem that, far know, start semester person switch online still leave country lose visa. unbelievable, got literally dumped. hey, United States Unfortunately, it‚Äôs deadly others. Really?

We free testing Denver Pepsi center everyone's masked time I'm at, including 70+% outdoors. people sense community compassion fellow citizens. selfish, feckless, morons. society doomed. symptoms Feb tested negative antibodies June. pretty surprised since flu vaccine like flu I'd ever had.. guess still possible all. I'm also really short breath ever since can't inhale way in. Don‚Äôt forget lick doorknob way home. throwing doctors hospital windows complained enough PPE. Russia probably lying deaths China is. Well break across white people too. There‚Äôa tons uneducated highly impoverished white people. aggregate Asians better educated higher wages race US. dad, worked medical field, reminds bottom 25% class still graduates. Yeah well *was* coronavirus, I'm unhappy antibody test came back negative 6 months later. unfortunately thats exponential growth works happen? I'm staying protect property. Yeah people different way Florida. Exactly. Granted I‚Äôm Old Town Saturday night, north 101 DIED mid-March everywhere I‚Äôve driven past 50% less since then. Also, small anecdotal practice, one doctors stopped accepting patients town well-being AZ patients. Lol, comment awesome! think issue is: what's going happen 2 years say 30% population caught already. going forced wear masks? want power. anyone wondered, people live themselves? goes heads? would like them? God feels depressing legitimately good question.  


That said, types like that, evacuate seem believe miracle plywood save them. wonder there's kind resource many people try stick hurricane end dying. Please cite sources claim would like crown us civil conversation awards.

People might ask... that? power anoint others prestigious accolades?

Is accredited award recognized legitimate group organization?

Is rumors start? Next thing people handing civil conversation awards reddit... (They're already right lol?)

Haha. like end positive/funny note because... Well.. feels nice First foremost I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre okay!

Just curious evolved case, mentioned sick two days. scratchy throat progress sore throat, develop fever, etc?

I assume super mild case, wondering symptoms came went. point OP reposting articles May, #However, team said estimate viewed ""illustration"" differences population affect herd immunity, ""rather exact value even best estimate.""

This theoretical paper interesting *theoretical* standpoint taken something applied reality. [Here's test hamsters Yeah complex concerns everything. adapt virus force us adapt collapse. like it.  

 death rate going go back up, likely happens. mother arrested. Taking immunocompromised daughter ‚Äúcovid party‚Äù get virus, treating drug known increase risk death. basically murdered daughter. Maybe stop buying guns bit time, eh? (albeit weak) defense say ""of people"" ""of people covid"", though I'm 99.96% sure actually meant people covid anyway. eager meet god.
This commendable. strongly doubt EU countries terribly America, I‚Äôm sure though. Regardless, opening schools seems like bad idea Numbercalling. 
USA wearing masks vs. countries did.
Masks work better people wear it. 
I see smart people wearing masks.
Of course Trump. remember Jeff Jarrett wrestle next match close Owen
He looked absolutely lost rightfully so, (I think thought Owen hurt dead)
His promo hard watch I‚Äôve noticed thing store. Nobody bitching masks don‚Äôt think ever have. course I‚Äôm assuming people let actually complied rules far I‚Äôve heard complaints  see point. group people afraid government controlling us pretty good grasp state vs. Federal government. thesis power grab Democratic state governors, Trump protecting us state-level control. man You‚Äôre gonna need buckle up. virus gonna long time. I'm health care worker. I'm really great job.

Awesome. bits. Especially latter. try get people sick, another post saw California believe texas governor made multi million dollar deal mask companies. Either buy mask profit fine $1000 really profit. wins either way. Seems kinda tyrranucal look way, sick all, also people remember flu season. picking data points spaced far enough apart time make judgement call whether exponential growth happen. That‚Äôs called cherry picking obvious attempt downplay this.

All want throw caution wind gamble peoples lives that, magically, virus decided stop killing.

And ignore every variable past history says kills.

And you‚Äôre ignorant think wouldn‚Äôt know reporting. I‚Äôve friends died it, I‚Äôve it, still friends coming it.

Just live rock ill informed, doesn‚Äôt mean rest world lives same.

Just another COVID denying troll. Good luck, hope one know dies. Yeah... majority many communities? Probably not. confirm people hard hit areas genuinely stupidest. ever feel bad yourself, remember there's folks trying purposefully get COVID-19 parties money. states 1/3 NY‚Äôs rate including increases. would like Texas calling New York reckless 12,000 cases /day April.

Let‚Äôs see everyone ends up. useful, thanks lot Good. Hopefully destroys California‚Äôs economy. Fuck em People microbiome immune systems. people survive cancer others don‚Äôt? people get sick winter dont?

If facing situation of:

* highly contagious virus 
* lot damage death substantial percentage population infection
* capable rather quickly mutates
* body can't defend against

Then either develop terrific anti-virals evolve become lot less susceptible. discussion Covid worse flu without vaccines far short something like Black Death. describing black death. reasonably 20-40% population die Covid next two decades Covid outpacing causes death combined. could more.  Game humans #2 predation pecking order, earth new dominant species. 

We start evolving less susceptible spend whatever takes anti-viral research stay ahead potentially hundreds strands operating forever.  society exists today generations technology evolves.

Sure discuss possibility think unlikely. dr explained yesterday arnt enough tests fo test people symptoms need now. rapid tests general worthless. That's answer, students sacrificed lot come US kicked out? spending money live here. kicking putting people danger sending possibly worse place US (and yeah US handling corona badly definitely worse countries there).  
What ones scholarships? may lose those. students already made lease contracts year? colleges open unprepared want lose income international students? I'm surprised posted drunken rant collar undone sleeves rolled cursing administration state governments incompetence fostering anti-science anti-public health culture nation. camps even opened?! What's wrong Americans? mean, can't tell people think things. mental health- quit thinking nightmare wake from, new normal adjust to. 

Like need wear shirts pants going outside, another layer apparel remember. Simplify like that. 

The virus going away anytime soon people power little stop it, cases made worse. 

We chance snip bud, blew it. consequences. accurate current official numbers?

As far aware lower often include certain populations. remember one regarding nursing homes. could completely wrong though Oh fuck, I've many doctors trough life dense. fucking cherry guy called Sugasti pretty famous pediatrician region, sister took son monthly checkings checked nephew hearth murmur.

"" starting late. CNN mistake, stories simple household items kill baby fear mongering around least 80s asked press conference: ""You said coronavirus outbreak stabilized. Could explain mean stabilized means case?"" 

I would love hear response that. *Cough* *Cough* *High Fives* I'm pretty darn sure flashing reason. enforce anything else highly doubt would enforced either. proven hoax. nurses went undercover proved beyond doubt. murderering people money hospitals. sick took roaring economy well, spite? Folks believe may want think little fresh oxygen pumped bubbles.  don‚Äôt get it. government tell restaurant close can‚Äôt tell bank can‚Äôt collect mortgages while?

Because lockdowns don‚Äôt fucking work unless get banks landlords stop collecting monthly bills. widening wealth gap. still get paid everyone else gets screwed. 

And can‚Äôt stop virus going population anyway. making things way worse prolonging bad times... accurate thing I've ever read? LOL even next headline. He's already saying he's feeling much better thanks hydroxychloroquine. Yup truly ton factors working together make catastrophic tragedy.

That‚Äôs don‚Äôt use meteorologists, also map flood zones evacuation architects following gov building codes mitigate risk. works conjunction point people sorta take granted. US president test negative COVID-19 ahead visit Obrador? Fauci bowed political pressure messaging before; (regarding: masks). read many anecdotes people claiming timeline much implies ""reinfection"" happens, dismiss it. hand - we'd need ""documented cases"" become accepted scientific consensus. California anymore. took books discriminatory. useful. false positive independent patients stage dependent test type? asian americans college (top 20) first/second gen immigrants. agree early ones lived poverty think represent community whole nuke shit protests cause spike? so, lockdowning makes sense. not, would seem everything less intense marching shoulder shoulder thousands strangers okay, right? fairness, Texas trying get rid PP anyway Yes, completely covered federal government been. ""$6,000 COVID test!"" articles always end someone admitted hospital lung scans whatever else. free get COVID test. Here, go get one. have. know positive? someone tattoo red cross forhead?

Actually, think good thing. them? cops take home something? Just? No. dies get army general history racist comments helm.

It's like famous saying: run beast eats you, stay beast grabs you. rationale clearly top priority (even though should), many people seem understand/care numbers. 

People area (orange county CA) protesting stay home order claiming needed ""restart economy"". protested mask mandate because...? I'm truly sure why... concerned economy, think would want reduce risk spread much possible. refused wearing masks social distancing minute rules reduced. Virus infects warm blooded creatures.  even test? cant dont test it. Canada exemption people valid student visa since lockdon March.

EU UK allowing international students cetern countries entre review list montly basis.

Australia relaxing rules students.

And also South Korea, Japan .....

If US goernment really worried abour health students university faculties, simply push guidance. get massage haircut? - Karens arrested. reckless endangerment Let die. Let stupids die.

Ok we'll check back Thursday :) Thank condolences. kid terrified them, despite I've never seen one person life.  


Now, well, there's even chance one nearby, probably innermost room family, but... 


/again, hoosier. California took books srx someone without telling infection status. laughed hard snorted anyone see coming? Yikes.. contrary, feel much admit it‚Äôs threat would set whole worldview askew cling illusion everything would fine people stopped afraid. Instead covering nose mouth, want everyone else plug ears close eyes doing. means hydroxycholoroquine dont work. need given first days symptoms azt precise dose. Source ? best epidemiologist world, Pr Raoult.

They nurse, physician assistant even want, stupid. situation/case denier ended getting COVID19? 

So far, everyone deny COVID19 gotten sick and/or died virus. 

Now, deniers deem deaths hoax / fake news well... much them. 

But, never let said enough warning evidence things bad. Filled dollar bills. ‚ÄúI sure hope Hitler dies‚Äù

Mods ban Allies later admitted lie back then. Anoher guy CDC admitted same.  Probably great hunter, build tower heavens thus angering God making us forget common language.  Please stop arguing disingenuously bad faith. excerpt posted makes clear ""chaos"" hospital cope, 

#Finally, patients G√§llivare transferred hospitals region. than, know, century experience infectious disease. logic ""well there's single piece evidence aliens build Stonehenge"".

Jesus fucking Christ intentional, fucking murder, trying profit it. woman needs charged tried, murderer. would way would ever meet Trump anything. would come excuse, like, oh, ""I go bathroom"" show. live Massachusetts. actually set program specifically test protestors, Boston area protests every day weeks. know people tested personally, program used. found 2.5% protested tested positive (over week start protests), compared 1.9% Massachusetts overall.

As sidenote, see higher rates covid urban areas, might explain increase.

Now, two weeks test, Massachusetts positive rates remain around 2%. still spike due protests. Even little shit Stuart Little? announcing positive result in-person interview several journalists camera operators different networks. that, saying taking hydroxychloroquine pills. easy guess hes gonna say recovers it. like Boris Thank nuanced discussion matter God big bang or...? seatbelt vehicle different vehicle privilege right America.

Tuesday lowest test day Florida due way cut report data. always expect lower tests higher percentage positive Tuesday. put weight Thursday Saturday day. hope ends ICU recovers.

I would never wish death upon anybody, would certainly teach lesson get sick.

I feel like Boris Johnson changed tune bit ICU. Sadly, that's running country instead people around *ahem Cummings* ""When said wanted lockdown lifted sure, lockdown lifted? said definitely want lockdown lifted, lockdown reversed?!

That means people die today probably got infected somewhere around June 20.

So whatever going June 1 - June 20 responsible death rates seeing now.

What happening time causing death rate fall now? I'm Canada. I'm hoping us pull together end summer. US others, they're lost causes point. Yeah Hollywood Hills parties. family gatherings, like multi generational families get together / live together. Birthdays, wedding celebrations etc.  can't stop large gatherings private residence, instead punish restaurants.  businesses survive chain restaurants drive thrus, unfortunately thing probably point low hanging fruit (old &amp; sick nursing homes) consumed. 40% died related extended care facilities. people longer us others much protected. I‚Äôm surprised death rate falling less risky natures version. I‚Äôm Italy everybody definitely wears masks here. might Northern European thing.  might stupid

Its entirely possible course is. first wave, 43% US deaths nursing homes: Canada, accounted whopping 81% deaths: bunch younger people got infected mass protests plus combo cabin fever locked down, schools/colleges going summer break, Memorial Day overall summer celebrations, etc...

It's younger people venturing now. opened gyms back too. Fucking Grade level shitburger thinking went Montana once. thought far north. got home, looked map. surprised see still lot land Montana! roads, even! totally shocked. thought end world there. I'm sorry hear that, hope parents fully recover soon. can't hospitial? what's point took mobile test site? sounds wrong... Mask usage Europe probably less 10% 10% even less wear properly Can't garden hospital bed. next pandemic also COVID. Reality Winner still prison. [Here analysis reveals difference without mandated face covering represents determinant shaping pandemic trends three epicenters. protective measure alone significantly reduced number infections, is, 78,000 Italy April 6 May 9 66,000 New York City April 17 May 9. mitigation measures, social distancing implemented United States, insufficient protecting public. conclude wearing face masks public corresponds effective means prevent interhuman transmission, inexpensive practice, conjunction simultaneous social distancing, quarantine, contact tracing, represents likely fighting opportunity stop COVID-19 pandemic. Unfortunately true. Yay for-profit health care. kinda like wearing masks honestly. gotten sick cold like year Wasn‚Äôt 300m multiple contender vaccines? thought thats read operation warp drive. Either way, multiple companies making able get globally pretty fast.  LOL yeah really worked well Boris didn‚Äôt it.
Dude actually would died two immigrant nurses didn‚Äôt stay side. much changed UK... need put money bottom once. need fund renters give least $2,000/month. Instead proposing strain little guys much longer pay landlords, landlords longer pay banks, banks get bailout again. That's plan! primary reason masks wearer protects others himself. Spain, one person gets covid, immediate family tested infected person required 1) isolate one room 2) use bathroom nobody else use.

During peak pandemic, lived covid- people tested covid+ one bathroom spare bedroom isolate in, offered option going specific hotel taking covid guests.

Bathrooms joke. infected person room air conditioner, sitting quite far away it. 

In Spain Germany several restaurant clusters lately, normal sit restaurants. Idiot governor. Disgusting governor. can't say words want say; harsh. hear actor lost leg due blood clot died couple days later. litterally said week ago.

Fucking ignorant orange piece shit. predictions clearly worst case scenario nothing done mitigate spread.

That models work. make predictions based changing X factor. prediction worst many predictions models made (the models predicting death x action taken, action taken, x + actions taken, etc).

Austrailia certainly go lockdown, slightly strict US states.

How know pandemic driven presymptomatic cases..? think general trend Europe. Certainly almost nobody using masks Scandinavia. They'll cross bridge get it. (But bridge gonna hold) do, gonna risk getting sick one busiest times airports. thanks. I‚Äôm tired seeing masks noses, it‚Äôs equivalent people pretending they‚Äôre obeying leash laws they‚Äôre holding leash hand isn‚Äôt attached dog filed separate days, 1. nothing particular, virus magically stabilized itself.

I actually bet element truth it, convenient excuse ignore growing problem impossible look away coming weeks Western media systematically compiled Beijing's epidemic-prevention policy, much I, ordinary person

This personal compilation, inevitably omissions, know add

I. Control Beijing whole

1. Beijing compulsorily blocked Xinfadi market, testing everyone quarantining mandatory 14 days.

2. Beijing citizens leaving city required provide proof negative nucleic acid test within 7 days.

3, Fengtai District initiate wartime management mechanism, establishment command headquarters

4„ÄÅLocate citizens near new development area mobile phone base station change personal health code yellow (prohibited leaving city, need to) (work)

5. Restoration control communities, access cards, temperature measurement.

6. taxis Beijing suspend trips Beijing, inter-provincial passenger transport suspended, train air tickets already purchased citizens free charge. refundable

7. Closure medium-risk schools

8„ÄÅThe indoor part tourist attractions Beijing suspended, flow libraries, museums art galleries limited 30%.

9. Stop exhibitions, large sports activities performances, close activity room entertainment room community.

10„ÄÅStop inter-provincial travel Beijing.

11. Catering stops weddings banquets.

12. Beijing classifies risk areas low, medium high (this based uniform assessment across regions China).

a. Targeting several highest-risk communities vicinity new development areas mandatory closures, denial access, procurement household goods medicines Completed community staff.

b. high-risk areas, minimize outings except procurement necessities.

c. high school risk areas, town prohibited regardless nucleic acid negative certification

II. Epidemiological tracking surveillance Beijing city

1. continued expand size test, new development marketers perimeter, high school risk area, full time, testing total 1,100 10,000 (core testing free, others voluntary)

2. Conduct epidemiological investigations, conduct environmental sampling key areas, identify core area infection meat trading hall Xinfadi market. Conduct quarantine. close contacts cases isolated retroactively, persons close contact infected quarantined. High-risk streets, township residents, employees Beijing's medical health institutions, service personnel public sector, students returned school faculty, frontline staff involved community prevention control key areas conduct nucleic acid tests confirm situation eliminate infections hospital. .

&amp;#x200B;

3. remove salmon shelves Beijing virus detected salmon mouth.

4„ÄÅTest imported food (including cold chain room temperature food) ask food inspection certificate ensure virus detected. longer spread means.

5. close underground farmers' markets potential problems professionally sterilize farmers' markets.

6. restaurants markets involved cases suspected cases closed. other. I'm verge wanting yell people. thought sign lease legally responsible still? require it. 

u/govSchwarzenegger I'm sorry missed re-infection list papers - could point it? ""Some¬†discussions health care¬†providers¬†here Tucson, shipping people San Diego and¬†Albuquerque,¬†New Mexico,"" Spurbeck said."" lucky shipped Phoenix.""  


The brother guy got moved said heard hospital staff people got moved states. big stretch consider happens hospital 0 ICU beds. need get bigger freezer cut food runs month.

during second lockdown, illegal runs. Exactly this. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs ok different beliefs opinions everything one equally valid‚Äù.

Yea, it‚Äôs something that‚Äôs debatable. something that‚Äôs proven true. Like moon landing fact earth isn‚Äôt flat. enforce fines fuck paying for? I'll tell right now, Orange County worst people. work fitness industry cannot tell many people try show fake exemptions scoff hard enforce it. get ear full political preferences, like, shut fuck boomer get program. Hahaha...you think Biden better one? BTW, dont know Trumper doesnt wear mask example. wear one whenever public, bonus-I wear gloves also. again, Trump thing. brainwashed believe that. Fuck dude, love toaster. Seems legit USA added 96,000 new cases 48 hours, let's open bars. Well seeing they‚Äôre relatively proactive compared US... might lockdown control current amount cases lockdown minimizing new risk infection. think almost nobody Norway, Finland, Denmark Sweden uses mask.

It would nice see scientific studies this. would great mask allowed open society pandemic. Bruh much thing elsewhere.

Japan too, crazy almost inhuman like work ethic younger people getting hit less deaths, see deaths last 2 weeks cases next week. Treatment also better march april hospitals fill like currently matter fatality rate rise alot really thought would case, looking NYC‚Äôs graph see uptick cases whatsoever. large northeastern cities also large protests same. looks like outdoors + masks pretty safe; i‚Äôm genuinely surprised  did. whole country well. minute restrictions loosened, people took advantage city packed socially distancing. sad, guess! Another scenario doesn‚Äôt work, make 2 billion shitty vaccines reason, people walk around thinking they‚Äôre good BOOM! Huge spikes again. posters take silly he'd admitting wrong, Trump never wrong, Trump smart, big smart, good know. People suprised smart, wonder smart, bigly smart. Reopened way soon caved pressure. Hopefully won‚Äôt again. Long overdue mandatory masks state wide. really good Geiger counter said rates far higher. one must wrong. Let's use rates know inacurate. Nah, go backcountry skiing exercise way I'm heading boring ass gym instead Thanks chiming in! looked it. Terrible investment unfortunately. profits eaten permits. Also every festival anything cancelled Damn, thought guys somewhat control. shame.  ‚ÄòMurcia. That‚Äôs got ya one. 191 cases day sends city almost full lockdown + state borders shut. America lot learn us Australia. know numbers under-reported? Brazil Important note country reacting state Victoria. Health country governed state level. rest country largely covid free.

As say say eyes Australia Victoria situation preventing interstate travel among things. advice foreign student would this:

1. go school elsewhere
2. Take half year wait election over
3. Biden certain win
4. Biden wins, one first priorities help foreign students
5. People react superhuman speed, classes start within 6 weeks Biden taking office - around March 1

It seems like huge amount risk me. Biden loses? Biden wins, get around reversing rule weeks? takes schools couple weeks organize re-opening foreign students?

Realistically, goes struck court (which sane world would second, since ICE internet connection school?), foreign students back American schools September 2021.

If ever. Yeah, Reddit UX good. Gimme back old reddit! can‚Äôt even get car parking lot without immediately shoulder shoulder someone. It‚Äôs sad ‚Äúmuh rights‚Äù, conspiracy nuts, COVID deniers groups opposed wearing masks members catch die. sometimes, they‚Äôll make last ditch effort let others know horribly wrong need take whole damn thing seriously. It‚Äôs sad takes fucking dying convince them. common practice wear mask countries like Japan even sick. people America want wear one even pandemic going on. yah gonna difficult urge people wear masks.  apologies, honestly assumed would good idea would provide available outdoor dining outdoor spaces shutdown, realize permit costs. still see many food trucks lined farmer's markets. 

I think people skeptical going *in* restaurants long time, thought might golden opportunity food trucks near future. trying help, apologize bad idea. Belgium. 
Masks suggestion people believe anything. China already bought mask world virus spreading there, telling countries.

Actually, case China biggest manufacturer masks worldwide ‚Äì needing helped China cover situation, virus spread quickly around world

I actually idea comes from. following news covid newspaper January! actually bought one mask end January case (which turned pointless ideas masks single-use, hey, live learn). February, checking (again newspapers) cities across Europe covid cases reported, looking photos lockdown Wuhan, reading epidemiological models spread China, ...

So country ignoring situation, obviously access Reuters AFP.  Imagine they‚Äôll act wins. ‚Äú8 years.‚Äù people vote hate fueled hearts. better fucking vote, people. It‚Äôs essential activity year. Lol. 

So mad didn‚Äôt know everything know immediately discovering *novel* virus.

Go back look qualifiers ‚Äúas far know‚Äù, ‚Äúthere currently evidence for‚Äù, etc 1586th wave?  Deaths ticking 5 6 current hotspots country. Cali exception. blunt truth wave 1b regional - looking country whole helpful, tho nationwide deaths likely start ticking soo - prior weekend flat. ""We're balls shirt"" - stupid brain Tourism dollars. met insulin? Sure, sucks, millions people get 1 day (and millions even use vacation summer get sick week?

This keep buffer vacation time. sickness, travel family emergency something? Travel tenable now, general approach take. means thinking twice switching jobs, even get pay, currently month PTO banked (plus pay good anyway). Well means, please continue absolutely nothing, Arizona. getting delivered food packages... well put. don‚Äôt complain taxes all. It‚Äôs 100% worth cost. 

I‚Äôve done number crunching years, I‚Äôve found really isn‚Äôt whole lot dumb spending going on. Much pay really costs much get working. Things like roads cost maintain harsh winter lot damage surface milder winters south. live whole lot apart, adds cost. 

There‚Äôs occasional dumb move made someone other, but, large, decisions made done responsibly. 

My one complaint neglect infrastructure sometimes happens budgets tight. 

I hope make current situation safely possible. it? never safety net. people advocating one decades labeled tin foil hat wearers need stop lazy go get damn job. wish hackers would send DDOS Attack Zoom women mentally ill, entire wide political segment country is. She‚Äôs repeating stuff hear radio, internet, millions millions people like her, masks ground away different. would rewarded 5 point drop approval rating.

You're assuming would let bodies pile let country go adrift like current POTUS. Germany government subsidies wages workers unemployment insurance companies reporting bad business due covid. pay around 60% wage often companies round 80 90%. think fantastic system always employees stay employed expensive throwing money people. illegal go store.

Correct. However, meant based horrible numbers coming US new cases, likely shit going hit fan people going ordered stay home expect shit show. confirm. friend right birthday vacation socal. wtf america yet per capita death rate Michigan VASTLY exceeds per capita death rate either Florida Texas. Max Brooks research! ever discover make someone live forever vow first given Fauci gave upvote 2020 points He‚Äôs America‚Äôs Dad pretty much. Wow means nothing know pandemic paying attention too

BTW rest world thinks utter joke. sure Lunar New Year early stage? Infections started China since November last year, yes, time one general public normal doctors know virus is, time everyone calls virus based origin. America's health care system always standard? means ten days ago probably testing capacity confirm many cases? ""Neat. Looks like I'm gonna house weekend."" It‚Äôs insane dogs could literally save life. much would probably backfire, adoption costs care reduce people could easily care dogs.

Seems like good idea us dogs. She‚Äôs pretty typical q anon world. isn‚Äôt fringe group. pretty mainstream point.

Those children given custody sponsors: family members, friends parents, etc. considered custody government and, missing means government called sponsors locate them. could range ""the sponsor unavailable"" ""the sponsor decided hide avoid deportation That‚Äôs kind interesting way think pandemic movies now. specifically think Contagion...but difference Contagion real-life virus movie, millions people showing extremely obvious symptoms dying streets...within days, hours exposure. COVID-19 taking lightly, millions people aren‚Äôt suddenly convulsing dying public. 

I bet people think pandemic, think Contagion Outbreak...an face deadly disease. That‚Äôs probably one reason people don‚Äôt take seriously, can‚Äôt see it. government medical organizations, scientists decision-makers charged solving crisis. would like think visible disease would get visible response...from everyone. 

IIRC somewhat throwaway line towards end Contagion, everyone getting vaccine, whereas say death count infected counts - death count (relative US population) lower way movie portrayed people dying coupled unrest... also surmise lot people may survived infection. movie doesn‚Äôt show though...makes wonder even world people arguing points quarantine, pandemic deniers, etc, etc. 

Btw- want good dramatic film pandemic show government, citizens, medical industry infighting, watch Band Played On. infighting realistic it‚Äôs true - it‚Äôs early days AIDS crisis. Guess things never change. book even better, reads like pandemic thriller (even pretty dated), Fauci even makes appearances. Apparently mutating.  illegal go store. talking about???

You're ridiculous. believe addressing different problem.

Nobody denies point out, i.e. covid seriously mess body. amply documented least since February, iirc.

Here, question whether people ""got better actually got sick \[...\]"" ‚Äì critical question people get sick again, destroys chances vaccine actually useful. Fauci says basically yes, far, good reasons believe worth pursuing vaccine. good news. perfect news, good news nevertheless.

(Ok, technically ""news"" he's summarizing information available months already. time, US listening, worth summarizing US public.) 12 Monkeys.  Yes, fake news. symptoms tested (again) coronavirus, results come yet, guy got ahead wrote sensationalist article (I guess hope it'd turn true he'd first report it? know journalists think). It‚Äôs way comforting. People die unsafe staffing ratios; that‚Äôs proven fact. Whether nurses willing put not, it‚Äôs patients suffer end.

In hospital, nurses ICU take 1-2 patients. nurses specialized can‚Äôt replaced anyone nursing license. hospital makes ICU nurse take 3-4 critical patients, end substandard care.

On floors hospital hard max 5 patients. Usually 4, floors routinely 3 based acuity patients. Even 5 patients overwhelming one two really sick complex. Now, consider hospitals, normal every day circumstances, make nurses take 6-8 patients. Imagine hospitals would willing crisis.

A hundred extra nurses drop bucket hospitals would need properly staffed think amount patients admitted covid. Plus, nurses getting sick, too. duck kill? FU university system US lives breathes international students. Let‚Äôs forget Mother Russia üá∑üá∫ Well, hopefully scholarship go American citizen. Knee deep?

Cases started climb around June 15. 

We started see effects around July 03.

But deaths *still* falling.

And interesting. deaths steadily falling past month half.

So means things opened up, people went crazy protesting ... behaviour leading Covid death rate.

Explanation? Fragile wittle redditor Quite reverse - tuition income devastated, expenses barely touched.

They going fire teachers - highest paid part. might cut janitorial staff, still need roles, still need buildings freeze boil, still need security.

But revenue cut would huge. friend mine teaches respected second-tier college US. 90% revenue tuition; almost 70% students foreign. They've desperately moving remote - friend working long hours summer - can't sell foreign students, lose _two-thirds_ income.   think logic is; let's get first vaccine kill people (which testing that's going right for) door. let's majority population, aside small negligible blocks people can't get immunized, go back something ""normal."" get everyone first vaccine fall can, like, go black friday shopping meet christmas dinner, keep working vaccines provide longer-lasting immunity.

I agree economy worth dying over, give temporary reprieve without much risk get economy started work long-term solution, what's harm?

Analogously, let's say we're sinking ship we're bailing water buckets, simultaneously patching hole boat. Bailing water keeps us afloat hole totally patched.  ""gets it"" super mild tell everyone nothing fear handle little covid anyone can. Thanks low effort wikipedia link issue vaccines sons reaction statements. seen proof statements truly disheartening.

18. Vaccines treated drugs government. result, safety tested way. typical drug might studied months years. Vaccines may monitored side-effects little 48 hours.
19. Vaccines aren‚Äôt tested truly inert placebos. They‚Äôre tested VACCINES! That‚Äôs compare safe vaccine is‚Äîby determining it‚Äôs safe another vaccine! Crazy true.

I‚Äôve telling people couple weeks, seems airborne, got ridiculed. they're lagging 30 days, one great explanation that's case. expect big explosion death rate coming, I'm starting wonder there's big factor we're taking account. always going problem hit height flu season, like seeing South Africa. really fair comparison countries middle summers. many people proactively tested like baseball players are? people would wear something covers face could protect along others. Never go attic without axe always sure actually room swing so. family members also hospital 12+ hours everyday? no? okay then. Oh cool. _You‚Äôve_ healthy horse. means it‚Äôs imaginary everyone else. That‚Äôs way bad people think.

Man, even assumed best you. is? never ""heavy handed"" tactics. loose, voluntary, half-assed inconsistent advisories staying inside, muddled mixed messages wildly inconsistent strategies one state next instead unified national strategy. total lack clarity understanding levels government, clear consistent message couple public education. **To day**, state many others consistently refused even *acknowledge* asymptomatic transmission occurs, let alone educate public it. taken us **months** get governor even acknowledge basic non-invasive protective measure imaginable - wearing simple cloth mask. 

The imposition quarantine protect majority emotionally difficult yet ethically imperative role public health entity. Governments simply listen experts. ""experts"" put mixed messages amid political turmoil government ignored anyway. never even attempted sort screening, testing quarantine incoming travelers. so-called ""lockdowns"" simple advisories asking people stay inside less time felt like it, avoid groups less arbitrary huge number - 50, 100, even 200 depending state. course, despite half-assed lockdowns actually *did* help slow little bit, course certain states rushed lift restrictions virus outbreak raging control.

If ***had*** taken aggressive, assertive response (or ""heavy handed tactics"" would it) would certainly *not* mess right now. believe me, go visit New Zealand countries exactly little cases able start going life normal...oh wait sorry can't, letting us piss-poor job banned us traveling there. also mention contact tracing requires cooperation. work nobody answers phone.

There needs huge campaign ""what information shared contact tracers"" too, soon becomes even somewhat common answer phone regarding tracers, know scammers going start calling people pretending tracers saying things like ""can please give us social security number verify say are"" ""we need credit card number file case [some insane reason can't even think since nothing SEEMS plausible, dumb people believe]"", etc. answer question instead downvoting. want real discussion I‚Äôm happy help educate. inflammatory doesn‚Äôt help anyone

We wear masks either get natural artificial herd immunity. either let virus spread millions die keep suppressed waiting vaccine.

Being masks like washing hands. It‚Äôs simple hygiene, scary medical intervention stupid comparison Y'know, day kayaked St Clair River, dawned me. saw Michigan's ""Huron Lady"" River boat, packed people, making loop around Canadian side.

The thing could ride half decent education daily cacophony abominable platitudes.

Thing is- virus become politicized.

Terrifying. 

These people would throw switch gas chamber cuz someone told to. Good luck losers. chooses flu vaccine US uses. Work future cretins. difference competence. Reddit fucking loves Tom Hanks jerking off.

HEY, USER r/Coronavirus! KNOW WEARING MASK? wait till insurance premium goes cover loses. Possible, seeing reflected positive negative test rates hospitalizations.

However, definitely need watching potential post 4th July surge.

The good news that's last major holiday now, though. problem though product needs stay wet 10 minutes kill coronavirus. tell kindergarten take mask pick nose fuck auto moderator shit. sub sucks. It‚Äôs *response* questioned, it‚Äôs *transparency*.

Teachers end paying supplies list school provide kids unable afford them. get reimbursed.

I volunteered cousins 1st-3rd grade classes several years saw time. know extra bucks afford give, please do.

I say districts decide open, paying supplies.

Mask mandates useless cause nobody actually enforce think uptick cases New york result businesses reopening? I. Really. Tried. used feel bad know fooled. 

Bit listen. Worse fight back get shitty. view enemy myself, family, country. fuck 'em.
Hats though keeping try. wish luck. live Switzerland, there‚Äôs virtually quarantine. afford quit would it. sorry choose health job. Orange County FL requires masks every store (Orlando suburbs). people put around chin walk in, 95% people wearing masks properly now. Colleges US operate variety models, baldly exploitative (for profit colleges, expensive liberal arts colleges financial aid, etc). Ivies, especially massive endowments, operate like all.

EDIT: expand this, since seems lot confusion Harvard general thread: Harvard spends around 2x full ticket undergraduate education per year, per student. lot schools, money goes extremely stupid things shore ""the experience"": fancy athletics facilities, nice dorm rooms, Cadillac experience really. Harvard, money goes faculty (who make peers US) explicitly academic items.

Bottom line Harvard spends absolute gobs cash actual education shit students, almost nothing comfort, good job churning well-educated people. They're able they've got fat-ass endowment clear priorities admin level: things universities lack. least they're starting obvious. white house goes things simply untrue. tax breaks directly proportional amount give community.

Just example cousin second guessing medications grandpas doctor gave him. didn‚Äôt know were, literally googling phone going ‚Äúoh shouldn‚Äôt take this‚Äù There‚Äôs lot people don‚Äôt wear mask wear improperly, get comfortable one somewhere take off. It‚Äôs humid feels like temp 100+. It‚Äôs infuriating welcome clever comebacks ideas use people ‚Äúbaaa‚Äù me. Here's thing - I'm New Jersey. family trip Universal Orlando planned early April obviously canceled. reopened Universal I'd read precautions, plus learning virus transmitted, etc., considered possibly going Universal. Maybe we'd drive.

That Florida putting NYC height numbers positive cases. completely changes risk calculus. get coming reason we're renting place bit north beach rather going anywhere south Virginia. local zoo opened New Jersey, precautions Universal went state appears gotten handle proceed reopening new case #'s quite time. Going zoo New Jersey felt bit earned, since stayed locked down, WFH, masks mandatory months now, various reasons. 

I truly believe Disney headed epic disaster reopening. Universal plaudits innovative ideas reopen safely numbers Florida still appeared low. Disney, now, appears pushing ahead reopening simultaneously juggling NBA, MLB, etc., high profile possibilities outbreak makes national headlines. Universal simply close anytime appear responsible waiting positive cases trend back downwards flatten. Disney, waiting long insisting reopening height pandemic Florida, ever assume position putting safety first. Hey, Y2K false alarm! spent billions dollars millions man hours fixing became problem.

If still level foresight! Jenn-ay? confidence chief anymore. He's behind 8 ball along thing including failure call pandemic everyone else was. tenured something? still job? don‚Äôt understand people see recorded decided time start acting crazy.

That‚Äôs define winning! I‚Äôm arguing that.  look cases know about, right fatality way 1%. problem many cases asymptomatic, brushed allergies they're major, even others people get tested. many cases might account for? Nobody really knows, actually pretty difficult guess many cases conditions.

The antibody testing might also wrong, due certain viruses similar antibody test able tell apart antibodies certain viruses leading potential false positives. Even mind though, asymptomatic carriers major reason next impossible know low fatality rate is. potential death rate inflated someone dying alternate causes happened COVID, still imagine make large portion.

There's many things determine exact fatality rate based available information, guessing based spreading rate factors many people actually came that's do. Even tested everyone, tests high accuracy 3 days symptoms appear even still give false negative 20% time previous comment. also affects many people differently based various factors like immune system, age, weight, health conditions, viral load, factors broken luck like genes.

Edit: Rereading this, first paragraph sounds super condescending. 100% intentional time, rereading comment feel like bit unwarranted. way wording question makes seem super backhanded, 100% possible asking sincerely. jumped conclusion malicious. I'm sorry that.

But ""stabilized"" article bit nuanced title implies.

It sounds like combination less experience major players interacting regulatory regime they're trying negotiate every benchmark aspect defining success &amp; milestones testing protocols. ‚ÄúThis stunningly high positive rate, indicates testing nearly sufficient actual number cases much, much higher.‚Äù

That‚Äôs big problem. People hard time getting tested (must show symptoms) do, lag 1-2 weeks results.

We flying blind. know, spread could 10 X amount, mention lag reporting.

Pretty much set pieces every scientist warned regarding ‚Äúworst case‚Äù. F‚Äôing sad. worked first responder island hurricane. kept telling people get out, especially low areas punch people refused. also warned leaving stations high ground hurricane's danger passed stayed. pleasantly surprised required instead sent try help anyone dumb enough try go windsurfing. later stuff pretty cool, like 90‚Äôs alternative genre bit more. modern science joke.... another time...

just like lockdowns masks...but get voted down...even though lock downs masks failing EVERY single country....but keep repeating Vietnam, Taiwan, New Zealand (no masks) success stories.

Here's hint...many ""early success stories""...all failing....Israel, Costa Rica, etc...here's pro-mask folks blind come.

Nah. dont care public themselves. Yeah, exactly. people filming things trying go viral. give want? ignore shit nah people understand math fine. problem *ideology*.

they stay lower elderly getting infected yes, 1) still concern bunch young, otherwise healthy people becoming chronic recipients care due long term damage, 2) likely keep elderly away virus spreads more. 

The spread is, harder becomes keep vulnerable people isolated safe. essentially like inverse herd immunity situation. 

This also ignoring fact even 18-40 group, hospitalizations exactly rare still overwhelm healthcare system. overwhelmed system going cause pretty severe increase deaths, even younger groups. % still relatively low, we're still flirting disaster letting run rampant.

Sorry, don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs state union purposely attempting infect people ‚Äúboost numbers‚Äù so-called ‚Äúdick measuring contest.‚Äù don‚Äôt trust government, really think virus crippled livelihood people (especially economic standpoint) government wants persist? mean, half country elected leaders acting like COVID isn‚Äôt truly serious matter whole time downplaying increasing case numbers, citing lower death rates, etc. economy return state virus took off. mean come man, there‚Äôs sufficient evidence show states actively hiding full extent virus underreporting cases deaths. would attempting ‚Äúboost numbers‚Äù infecting people intentionally? international students, classes person component (so blended classes, classes go online partway year) count person credit. know works graduate students, undergraduate least 12 credit hours, least 9 ""in person"". agree system needs change, simply explaining work around schools willing it. bring everybody back, open class sections person discussion questions enough classes international students stuck campus continue stay. extra grad students feel comfortable leading person it, reserve lecture hall/go outside teach ensuring social distancing top mask use. realize lot schools sent everybody home, lot international students outside country right now, simply alternative plan universities like mine. Universities planning full opening late August, planning unknown ""online accomodations"" refuse come back person. also changing class times ""ensure social distancing"", still updated times. Big problem guidance covid parties hundred kids. Cross fingers hope Sept-Jan vaccine predictions right. Asymptomatic. Yeah fever anything got tested tested positive. months ago he‚Äôs seeing minor issues now. Like rashes... gets complicated certain re-exposed it‚Äôs virus laying dormant exactly. got Tauranga? stay second night? Kissimmee here!! Disney open scheduled, governor complete idiot, give shit us. $$$$ told live it!!! What??? Also kids back school August. Sunshine state screwed!! think lot people position pretty much send kids back school economic reasons. People budget year-round childcare.

I mean, think opening on-campus schools Florida bad decision. also think ***not*** opening bad decision, different reasons. mess. Oh god, go away. herd immunity time, doctors confirmed even possible. stop talking shit herd immunity six months. doctors know, certainly don't.

You worst kind troll. Spreading misinformation make feel smart. Damn, imagine 3%. would absolutely terrifying. great response, thanks proving point. made statement, prove it. Time buy stock body bags. coward crook meet coward crook. It‚Äôs theory. Neutralizing antibodies virus vaccines work. 

I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs much stretch think Trump head state would get plasma infusion containing specific neutralizing antibodies recovered Covid patient prevent getting infected. 

But say personal belief it‚Äôs like White House going confirm this. 

Thanks discussion food thought hope nice day stay safe healthy. Happy Cake Day! (And official permission skip gym work off) think part is, Ford anything feds would invoked emergency act done themselves. day post death number case number state.

I feel like poverty , systemic abuse everyday citizens , disease pretty big variables ..... homelessness can't help . Harvard medical school easily run PCR test. standard equipment. agree misleading headline. study casting doubt possibility herd immunity, casts doubt idea herd immunity sensible goal (if anyone still believed that). fact study could say confidence around 5% Spain's population immunity even though already suffered staggering 28,000 deaths. gets much worse bordering states, Mexico really build wall pay it. mocking comment called ""sweetie"" attempted lecture things knew nothing about.  Well don‚Äôt luxury, jobs opening back can‚Äôt get paid unemployment benefits refusing go work. deff tested more, think short shutting down, would affected much. mean, deaths may spike bad. Maybe infections keep amongst younger less vulnerable population, maybe treatments available means even deaths bad.

Or maybe deaths still bad infected, case time realize it'd far, far late put brakes things. agree sentiment, sounds like bullshit buddy would say trying pick random piece ass. Mike, what‚Äôs up? karma supposed work. idea, then, left house five times since March, two surgery. Duh. open warehouse. lot areas tightly packed. Lots older people work to.

I also see pushing mandatory vaccine, although would hope enough people would want get would get herd immunity anyway. now, work health care elder care employer typically requires flu shot, would probably coronavirus. much liability employees kill grandma assisted living facility want vaccine.

If really want help them, start convincing leave Canada. That's necessarily true. ATU represents hundreds thousands transit operators states know represent TTC operators Toronto well. move toward unnecessary in-person interaction putting lives danger.

Making classes in-person, even partially, even few, kill people. That's math.

Now they're saying ""the flu kills more"" denial reality. don‚Äôt droplets building mask dripping like sweat, serious problem.

Masks work. Cloth masks work. one saying it‚Äôs 100%, heck even 15% reduction something know it‚Äôs that.

Curbside pickup ""oh, pick hours"" right now. days week depending area. Whether actual company picking items delivery service, wrong. Maybe someone wants browse pick items want. Maybe food allergies need read ingredients make sure actually eat item.

Just saying use curbside useful. People confined houses months end can't wear one. Lets see sheep it. subsequent reinfections still less serious. I'm 100% you. gotta idiot defend Chinese like innocent this. Okay, let's say 1% (death rate higher would floor ventilators, we'll low ball it). 11.6 million cases covid worldwide according Google. means low-ball estimate 116,000 people needed ventilators worldwide due COVID.

How know that's low-ball estimate? 132,000 people died US alone. 500,000 world wide. got ventilators course, would guess dying little bit worse ventilator. Bit permanent. Reminds woman posting local community Facebook group. claims asthma masks made pass twice.

Some states well implementing measures limit spread average skewed wrong direction states flat ignored recommendations. Getting health care anti-freedom. keep seeing sorts claims attempting credible last week so.

Is someone attempting manipulate public opinion again? talking about? kErvE hAz biN FLaTtEntD sure feel that, tbh... Exactly. sadly, yet see doctor, healthcare worker, talking head, scientist acknowledge one simple fact COVID world share:

When inside, breathe people's exhale breathe yours. (to fractional % course). 6 feet 60.

Do humans think air exhale used particular breath stops existing done it??? mammal breathe exhale?

Ugh. many born-yesterdays even walk? agree, there‚Äôs arguments made realistic vs. unrealistic expectations. It‚Äôs always better undersell overdeliver vice versa. think biggest thing consider several reasons many vaccines take several years finish (and potential vaccines won‚Äôt take long, work). major hurdles funding finding patients. Many traditional vaccines take years develop, years test finding qualified patients. often slow trickle, depending disease country prevalent in. Often times companies Universities/hospitals fight claw funding several months clinical phases (I-II-III) justify continuing. Even results successful, sometimes funding isn‚Äôt justified. unfortunately common diseases common poorer countries prevalent US industrialized nations. abundance vaccines pause stage simply run money fund trials run patients trial on, SARS/MERS. It‚Äôs important understand problem COVID19, abundance cash flow, demand, abundance patients many countries. could gather 30,000 people phase III trial US alone within matter weeks, that. process usually takes years get high enough ‚Äún‚Äù. typical developmental timelines, Oxford vaccine 2+ year head start development entire premise mRNA based vaccines like Moderna‚Äôs rapidly developed, less key selling point. exciting future diseases mRNA proves safe effective, timeline 5-10 years like previous vaccines. many people hopeful/skeptical timeline desperate/afraid first people sign ‚Äúrushed‚Äù vaccine, assure isn‚Äôt rushed might seem take things account. means saying cut corners vaccine can‚Äôt tragically unseen side effects like Guillain-Barr√© syndrome, past. problem don‚Äôt see problems typical clinical trials anyways, even take 5 years sample population 10-30,000 people far less millions receive dose. Unintended rare side effects happen, unfortunately whether it‚Äôs 1 million (typical) 1 10,000 (very bad) hard say fully even best desired clinical trials simply low number patients trial. vaccine India supposedly plans releasing soon, may another story... digress. biggest hurdle production/logistics, there‚Äôs anything pharmaceutical companies well make money, want evidence manufacturing times crisis look World Wars. biggest tragedy thus far manufacturing potentials weren‚Äôt ramped January/February PPE, that‚Äôs separate issue. It‚Äôs complicated industry realize things aren‚Äôt simple, especially without federal intervention oversight. Sorry novel. know lot people subreddit scared angry, I. can‚Äôt lose (realistic) hope things improve.

Cow-towing happens leave bovine blue space without placard We've yet see medical systems overwhelmed way March April we're better job protecting elderly--for now. cases, risk reaches high risk populations.

We treating better before, states run ICU beds, we'll see spike. I'm, honestly, concerned potential hundreds thousands chronically ill Americans. we're treating better, we'll see fewer deaths, still damaging bodies. masks, distancing, limit indoor prolonged gatherings much possible, work home, etc. stuff people right now

EDIT:  I'd like see substantial proof

I mean, I'm sure mean substantial. Even younger patients mild cases finding degraded lung functions, low blood oxygen, fatigue, etc, weeks months longer test positive virus. 

If waiting peer reviewed paper studying long term effects we're likely still months away anything observational studies done far. schools, sadly, open back cases going EXPLODE.

Remember, students go home 3:15pm day. remember, can't listen experts change could wrong. guy zero medical knowledge holds title governor refuses lead...he definitely one listen to...because knows, could right experts. Also like, country overweight? Like, good majority? maybe die Covid, chubbiness indicator dying it, fact suddenly okay majority country possibly dying disease little gross. care accidentally give Covid overweight loved one ""because affect you"" die? really believe life less important yours?

Also MAJORITY country overweight &amp; MAJORITY country needs incubated (not saying since overweight isnt automatic death sentence Covid theoretically), that's looking good either buddy, whether get sick. society goes toilet going it. DeSantis: Everyone, announcement make...I got bold new plan fight COVID-19!

Public: Wha-What it? going finally close bars? maybe postpone plans reopen Disney World?

DeSantis: Even better! We're going think positively! Instead thinking number people going die virus well complications could arise opening theme park midst pandemic, let's think everything going work fine. way, there's chance everything work well. See, feel happier already!

Public: ...So plan exact thing since March? Great. Wonderful. keeps using word. * milk: meat: spouting things knows nothing about. First, nobody knows long immunity last saying certain last premature.


Secondly, antibodies source immunity. normal antibodies fade away while, even viruses lifelong immunity to. cells tend remember virus produce needed antibodies virus shows again. go back point 1 though, know yet long immunity lasts, can't say goes away antibodies dissipate.


And thirdly says coronavirus long term immunity. That's blatantly false SARS1 shown several years immunity cases. They've ""requesting"" ""suggesting"" people wear masks time now, apart one boroughs, seems nobody guts make mandatory. know takes hours FL get tested appointment better nothing. What‚Äôs CO?

Remember, students go home 3:15pm day.  want know timeline coming from. 

From people think 100 chefs bake cake 1 minute.

I know tell people - Droughts follow timeline. Wildfires follow timeline. Hurricanes follow timeline.

If evacuated fire hurricane, would return burning flooded house? Trudeau done controversial things. didn‚Äôt research maybe issue resolved there‚Äôs whole SNC Lavalin thing. There‚Äôs also new firearm ban pushed through, probably things people disagree with. much others probably, blackface definitely isn‚Äôt controversy   Shameful policy. COVID isn‚Äôt disease I‚Äôd worried catching party. ever time US make China overpay something, American produced vaccine COVID-19. see countries forcing out? It‚Äôs moronic move send people back home, especially country isn‚Äôt handling pandemic well. Also, international students aren‚Äôt even allowed work off-campus they‚Äôre taking 0 jobs. age group also likely survive virus without much help. significantly think taxing medical resources? Better odds either two America managing it. would allow know whether spread protest. could publicly state X number people tested positive X event protest ask anyone else ensure get tested immediately Well nothing certain moment, even immunity also possible. hoping least year natural immunity, however seems like average people getting 3 months protection, that. 

About antibodies, may may protective. protective, vaccine efforts also fail. Presence protective T-lymphocytes memory B-lymphocytes also unknown. People taking granted though, like took herd immunity granted. Turned great.

I hopeful beginning, think situation new normal, see way out. Honestly, I‚Äôm stupid that. I‚Äôm flunking college now. won‚Äôt allowed return Fall. erratic behavior anxiety/depression ruined life. Americans prob won‚Äôt learn part flattening curve there‚Äôs point return Hell, could use photo Trump rally BLM rally pass Turing Test. tested positive, chances they'll saying exact shit. building next door could fire people deny right moment fire spreads home wonder Trump trying kill save Social Security. Also, open jobs. sure. definitely don‚Äôt blame parents. choice send kids school miss full day work, think would send kid school. Jobs need give time, heck time, sick. I'm sure american freedom allowed stupid one wants true equality.  death rate declined hospitals weren‚Äôt overwhelmed. Half billion month number I‚Äôve hearing. Jails COVID multipliers. Realistically research shown mask use lockdown **most** businesses unneeded. feel important grab brew local pub people doe it; doubt I'll able change mind. Hey TIL thanks sharing friend Also REALLY sick. younger people milder symptoms weren‚Äôt tested Fascinating see progressive people wear masks socially distance.

See, hard logical, it. even. assholes going go back homes US spread it. Florida basically giant coronaboil pop rest nation. Ridiculous! source? article Victoria‚Äôs 2nd wave [Truly mystery exactly scares me. I‚Äôm studying go data analytics sports idea may never get absolutely crushes me. I‚Äôm beyond scared days. used work person large number parole probation violation holds. county decided want deal inmates, pushed state. Show peer reviewed papers touting reinfections I'll see them. Show neckbeard commenting reinfection reddit pounding pizza rolls I'll definitely dismiss shit. Speaking stuck, slow pizza rolls. Also expected group homes severely locked fucked system agree database issue; however, point still stands contact tracing worthless exercise can‚Äôt identify people large gatherings whether church, protest, beach, large congregation. South Korea controlled things really well still deal super-spreader event religious service cult (sorry don‚Äôt know proper term group) 3% asymptomatic carriers... Oh yeah they've since news broke late Jan. mean say, response treatments reaaaaally make look like nee *something* dealing with... Trump wanted knowledge Black Face materials. county Bay Area opened indoor dining haircuts exactly one week ago. Still gyms opened. yet! still massive increase cases hospitalizations last week, much got put governor's watch list today shut indoor dining less one week reopening. 

I'm sure exactly caused spike here, Marin County north SF.

Anecdotally I've seen neighbors family friends Mother's Day times since. understand people irretrievably dumb, yet get far life. awful. Especially consider, probably suffer mental illness, get treated, instead they're sentenced rot prison. Anyone following number daily cases reported Russia find fascinating consistently around 6,600 6,700. Day day day... someone already black belt social distancing befor started, last social contacs gone, whole mess really taking toll mental stability Good thing nobody going become homeless due lockdown, then. Phew! real bottleneck going shortage trained ICU nurses. Can‚Äôt build fly, unfortunately. US. OP, still same. Heels deeper. It‚Äôs either Trump Kanye Meanwhile NYC walked 5 mins apartment. Waited 10 mins free antibody PCR test results next two days... No. Stock market doesn‚Äôt care deaths. Stock market cares governments response deaths.

Since government shown care stock market Americans dying, expect stocks keep climbing Fuck. daily briefings worst everything real source strength. speaking myself, scary watch states start go already. Zeynep Twitter says stop worrying beaches half expect DeSantis bail start job 'safe location.' know really small sample size (90) anyone real data fatality odds? start thing, like 0.03% (which really high), Italy like 12% (which essentially bio-weapon numbers high). now, 7 months later, accurate fatality odds Covid-19? overrun virus still 5% immunity. 

That's true statement. something journalist came misunderstanding paper seroprevalence Spain. found 5% antibodies lower bound immunity. local college already hurting enrollment. friend professor pressured find students want enroll. Shes professor, recruiter. think help stay afloat. Hopefully keeps dropping feel safer relative young people.... Okay, thought. reading studies explaining 3 5% population developing natural immunity virus. numbers obviously fluctuate depending multiple factors region, early research. 

In places strategy rely people becoming immune virus mix natural immunity future vaccination (which majority becomes immune called herd immunity) 

The point making virus damaging ability fight exposed it, may objectively challenging achieve. 

To idiots thinks logic flawed, please go research statistics global health professionals dying virus. often young healthy increasingly taking ill despite precautions. appears due prolonged exposure rather single instances. accept legal bribes! got feel her. looked like causing pain logorrhoea. What? already know people dying long term impacts. know? Selfish people proven they‚Äôre willing change No. won't. thing sucks, media business scaring people ratings. Find somene say something crazy dire write article story them. would think; USA still enough testing capacity actually that. I've said many times: old, sick vulnerable people. Mr Hanks made alive. mean everyone will? no. fortunate enough survive everyone is. one man particular made fine mean everyone will. no, extremely sick. hope I've answered question well. Russia numbers reflect Facts numbers, problematic....kind like believing can't say 41 years old without defining many days year, hours day, seconds hour. think numbers sound wonky, research prove wrong. interested complaining ""tone"" factual statement, correct? Y‚Äôall seals tho. anyone pass along good news? Accidentally scrolling seeing bad news reading pessimistic yet realistic comment kinda hurts sometimes wouldn‚Äôt mind good news moment time Trudeau deserves great deal respect thanks he's handled this. far best leader North America offer days. shocked Disney willing become company says ""we care lives, money bring parks"" young kids lowest risk category. Parents want kids go back right hold back. people can't afford someone watch kids every day go work. talking about? Better let billion people die then. vaccine isn‚Äôt sure thing. Folks need stop banking that. C'mon...one teensy little prayer? still loads people protesting wearing masks? seen protests month live major city. think small one 4th july, first one long time. often pay even out-of-state students. Canada calls CUSMA. quick let called USMCA. Perhaps get better search engine. scroll thread. I'm right concerned boat. Unfortunately little one daycare creating unbelievable anxiety. But, work. I'm working home wife working office. Thankfully office taking substantial precautions mitigate risk much possible. daycare seems can, they're plague carrying kids pandemic not, can't control parents. public maybe 10 times past four months, mask every time course. 

To quote Jim Jefferies:

""I guess now"" Can't speak counties shut down, live Napa compliance mask order near 100%, least seen personally.

While occasional person wearing mask incorrectly, yet see anybody wearing one grocery shopping one argument customer job (the customer lost one). People say grade inflation, yet students schools extremely stressed struggling get decent grades. lucky get vaccine year, countries would low overall infection rate. Canada 300 new cases yesterday, year would see roughly 100,000 total new cases. everyone. Germany sees 400 new cases day recently, around 146,000 cases year. would take 550 years infect germany.

America, even 50,000 new cases day would still take 20 years infect entire country. somehow manage keep 50,000 day, able get vaccine time USA completely infected insane amount death. isn‚Äôt news lol. announced last week. whole state including gyms really effective. There‚Äôs thing called driving next county lot people do. Vape chef, you‚Äôll okay. Keep pursuing bachelors... look job field associates interviews stress you‚Äôre pursuing bachelors.

Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever named, Russians insisted they'd named first. disease matter national pride. best body bags! tell people dying get them. know, that's tell me. F Disney Florida yup, hopefully people wake soon bullshit. China lied concealed world weeks/months. Suddenly they're hero? China probably reddit users posting 2minute edited videos showing police overly aggressive every white person trying hurt blacks. think China trying incite race wars/cause unrest US. Yes. wage slaves needed. Boop boop, beep beep. Narrator: ‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt.‚Äù ""You guys used worried deaths, look deaths now, record low! guys changed goalposts started worrying hospitalizations. never accept things getting better, keep changing goalposts!"" --Covid Truther (who comprehend hospitalizations lag cases, deaths lag hospitalizations) Nope, lie.

If look data linked article, 33k / 71k deaths (at time) 80+ years old. ~47% 80 older (compared 60% hard-hit rich countries according article). also see graphs article.  realistic picture.

Deontology ethical school thought requires means end goal must moral ethical; utilitarian school ethical thought states end goal justifies means even means moral.

The ethical principles nurses must adhere principles justice, beneficence, nonmaleficence, accountability, fidelity, autonomy, veracity.

Justice fairness. Nurses must fair distribute care, example, among patients group patients taking care of. Care must fairly, justly, equitably distributed among group patients.

Beneficence good right thing patient.

Nonmaleficence harm, stated historical Hippocratic Oath. Harm intentional unintentional.

Accountability accepting responsibility one's actions. Nurses accountable nursing care actions. must accept professional personal consequences occur result actions.

Fidelity keeping one's promises. nurse must faithful true professional promises responsibilities providing high quality, safe care competent manner.

Autonomy patient self-determination upheld nurse accepts client unique person innate right opinions, perspectives, values beliefs. Nurses encourage patients make decision without judgments coercion nurse. patient right reject accept treatments.

Veracity completely truthful patients; nurses must withhold whole truth clients even may lead patient distress.  God forbid American cops would *save* lives.  stupid. Lowest number new COVID deaths reported US Monday since March 23rd. statisticians haven‚Äôt found correlation areas high protest activity spikes coronavirus? stats wrong help narrative. Actionewsnow.com run Sloths. Well much us immunity due colds caused corona viruses. Yh developed world made huge progress. US case numbers actually falling till around June 10th started rise. Seems states like Florida Texas etc seeing huge spike cases whilst states like NY still seeing downward trend cases essential fact economy cannot recover virus well controlled hard many people understand? 

If bit goddamn bullet could better side this. 

Instead, I'm sitting parking lot eating carside-to-go watching fine people New Hampshire sitting bar masks on. local transmission, I'm worried yet. oh lawd, Rona's comin' ...again. What? would expect predict death count? 

We know death rate covid low populations. mean big deal massive rise cases. know 10 people saved seat belts one freak accident wrong place airbags would stopped sideways slide. ending lockdown early dumb. needed 8-week \*hard\* lockdown allowed us starve virus - get positivity rate 1 2 percent open mask ordinance. hard. nope - America likes things hard way ao are. TIL Oxford China. Self regulating white supreamecist death-squads?... No, wait. can't right... It'll come me. almost government branch Florida trying compete cause infections.. flip side (and somewhat comforting) part excess deaths substantially higher early part pandemic COVID death toll indicates, excess fallen substantially recently. 

Week ending April 11 stunning 35% excess death rate. week ending June 6 3-6% excess, official Covid death rate fallen ~1,000 day 500 day since then, might zero now. little early determine this? look way, understand argument. point also stands; force students US makes safer them(students). words used suspected got autoatmically booted either ""Tr*mp"" ""R*ssian disinf* ops"". one those.

CDC says works hand hygiene:   Wait, mean government employees give economic penalty adhere mandates proclaimed public health? Yeah. complain poor people treated unfairly man! Def edgy high schooler shit, amirite? Lol talk fucking cringe

Same dumb fucks complaining money also take issue said comment. wonder fucking why. Joey never get cancelled stopped shit it‚Äôs tracks pretty quick got 300 million whole population would take bit longer month  Meanwhile official data CDC Feb-June shows 2% excess deaths. gets updated daily CDC audits deaths. 
See yourself. Nice straw man. Go back read initial comment you‚Äôll see I‚Äôve done nothing you‚Äôre accusing of. 

If go back read still think I‚Äôm part weird conspiracy group you‚Äôre arguing response, goes show lack sort ability critically think, prefer disingenuous interactions people. 

Good luck that.  Gee, wish could live fake bubble rather deal reality. Unfortunately, brain won‚Äôt let lie myself. duh! Apparently I‚Äôm great searching, I‚Äôm really interested current, massive uptick cases there‚Äôs isn‚Äôt correlating surge deaths. know part testing becoming readily available, surely can‚Äôt factor here. anyone help point right direction? Thank you! Hospitals running space US. avoidable. isn‚Äôt universal issue, many nations coping virus. **This isn‚Äôt fear mongering objective fact.** 

Lol fear mongering? Feel free check reddit comments. I‚Äôve openly long term lockdowns months. arguing massive death rate since first large scale antibody tests ever conducted. Basically opposite fear mongering. virus completely manageable developed nation. answer masks certain level social distancing foreseeable future. That's A+ ‚Äú250,00‚Äù number. Wish could upvote 1000 times. It‚Äôs true. many years???? Tested today. told would 1-2 weeks heard anything. Point exposure someone still A-symptomatic, received test part upcoming medical procedure. Took 4 hours. We're seeing numbers week ago. next weeks going intense. stabilized runaway condition!! think misreading it. team name ""FC Dallas Pull Out"", they're MLS team, they're BACK! 11 positive coronavirus cases. opinion changed quite bit past weeks I'm coming recognize wrong past Ya, I'd pass until, say, January inauguration new president. Stay now, Justin. need ya. Hospitalizations increasing increasing slower pace week ago. True regions Texas except LRGV. irrelevant, irrational. I‚Äôm feeling lot despair this. wife middle school teacher three school aged children well. wife health issues make nervous go back. afternoon school district still considering multiple options including split schedules online classes. that‚Äôs wiped away one fell swoop. wish could tell quit job provides health care family addition needed income. lot good alternatives situation. Fuck Florida governor administration. can't remember read think reporting covid deaths usually delayed week so. 

But say friends mother died July 4th would Saturday? Weekend death toll numbers often artificially low due less staff working weekend especially weekend holiday. That's death toll often higher week. Yeah, let's stick weekly averages. know full well cases typically fall weekends go Monday-Tuesday. saying alarmed lived Dallas, 16% figure good junk. rich Englishmen would killed regardless Yes no, introvert like ALONE time I‚Äôm stuck inside w 3 others time... give shit needless deaths due COVID-19, give shit needless deaths due guns? Fuck you! verified profile, freaking dumbass! T-cell response usual response virus intracellular organisms (Natural Killer T-Cells), antibodies (B-cell response) adjacent response, independent one. antibodies T-cells respond faster don't.  Hint: people enforce every public health mandate Grown adults paid money ""award"" post. lol Well universities colleges resume physical classes avoid losing students. Also students choose non-online courses fear never able come back future. basically forcing everyone go back ‚Äúnormal‚Äù like told people go back work order losing unemployment benefitsq Need meritocracy, uneducated bimbos believe sky fairies would never go it.

Like, everyone could get vote... pass high-school, get two votes, college 3 votes, university 4 votes, masters 5 votes, phD 6 votes, add additional votes things majoring something particularly important politics, political science, law, history, economics, science, engineering, medicine. like, uni grad studied fucking english women's studies gets 4 votes, studied poli sci econ something, get 5 6 votes. phds, phd something dumb? 6 votes, something useful society? 7 8 votes.

Currently working? get extra vote! Got kids? fuck you, ain't getting extra votes smearing sperm egg point, least would limit 1 extra vote number kids. 1 kid 10 kids, 1 extra vote, maybe I'll go that.

So know, best best basically get 10 12 votes something, whilst butt-picker hill billy never passed grade 10 kids job gets 1 vote. Stop already! month ago, June 6th. ""It's month now."" simply incorrect whatever way put it. ""spike"" started middle June. shame people see people disposable beat it. Take upvote. Nope. wow imagine brainless would guess takes code covid death. Everything seems lag this.

Also, sorry friends loss. problem cultural, political. order adopt pro-public health policies like staying home sick, need better social safety net. People can't stay home sick they're worried they're going pay bills put food table pay daycare. need protections people able keep jobs income get sick. Health insurance tied employment also adds another layer ridiculousness it. 

When EVERYONE home non-essential businesses closed, people started realize social safety net enough. Unfortunately, conclusion pushed many power ""strengthen social safety net keep everyone safe"", rather, ""get back work (because work truly Americans value) restart economy."" cheaper think meant start sentence like ‚ÄúListen, Florida man slacked ...‚Äù worst part whole thing eyes risk great would handled well early. lock spent sniping politicing instead building solid testing/tracing system limiting spread.

So opinion (which informed higher learning expertise) countries got crap together solid response good holiday fun. Us hand (usa) forced(self enforced) socially isolate virus wide spread tracing contacts viable.

If current situation indication, right. seems like large % us even socially isolate couple months protect other, doubt get much better time even deaths (assumeing) continue pile up.

I'm surprised big hardship people seems be. interesting see poorer countries deal, without easy access cell phones, stable vid/net, tv, demand etc. probably underestimate hard people due introvert.

All mean previous comment harshly. tickled irony bone. :) Leonardo DiCaprio could lived? Hello boys. ü§£ would predicted long take started notice positive effect? done much meds try help depression?

That said, boy howdy feel bad living one scarier places right now. voice reason must suck hard. Trump cruel man. Magic Kingdom... magical petri dish earth. I'm sorry sister, share anger basically whole world. days try think shitty everything days. Stay strong. work university another state, exactly I've saying administration. ridiculous. assume country rules.  politicians push get faster denying responsibility problem. Cognitive dissonance hell drug.

Source - Studied BYU (but finally figured out) helps, scientists believe brief encounters low risk, probably need extended contact (10 min more) risk getting infected becomes significant, analysis this. Take care Trudeau stupid trump wise tell fuck Work home bad home office. Instead office worth stuff junking bedroom living room again, economic considerations trumping health. Many universities colleges either verge going say are, others want take much cut sense online education displace them. It‚Äôs random. (and made numbers), 1/1000 healthy people 40s get coronavirus die, Nick Cordero outlier 1/1000. gets news story he‚Äôs famous exception rule.

Meanwhile, 1/10 people get coronavirus they‚Äôre 100+ survive, survivors group. They‚Äôll probably get news story they‚Äôre rare, you‚Äôll hear them.

That doesn‚Äôt mean act though we‚Äôre immune we‚Äôre low-risk group. inform public policy related virus.  Pretty soon gotta run sick people ""So What?"" ‚ÄîBolsonaro, April 2020


What comes around goes around guess. I'd like go, Orange County FL finding positives per day New York State per day right now. That's risky me. Exactly this. young healthy people I'm closest would 99% got COVID passed.My Grandma high blood pressure, grandpa something wrong eye, dad high cholesterol slightly overweight mom got cancer last year.

At least pretty smart everything hope vaccine something xmas may see them. Expected Hopefully long shelf life... Administrative fines taxes usually allowed included bankruptcy protection. bankruptcy judge make exception. 129 million (19 50 percent of) non-elderly Americans type pre-existing health guess 132k PREVENTABLE deaths US alone don‚Äôt matter??? 

132k dead humans families, wives, husbands, children, best friends, students, etc. sure, likely survive covid student gives me. could easily infect parents, advisors, even bus driver. people don‚Äôt stop mattering bc survived. death rate ZERO close end sight deploying logic. Get well soon. Asthmatic, trust article. Harvard published study last month saying exact opposite. feel much Great let‚Äôs open schools right tater tot?‚Äô Defrocked - add bucket list. sitting there, packaged ready go. going able produce doses, big issues actually packaging actually distributing it.

There article Wired week ago discussed many issues, quotes directly CEO challenge making vaccine itself, it‚Äôs filling vials. aren‚Äôt enough vials world,‚Äù Pascal Soriot, executive director CEO AstraZeneca, told reporters press briefing last month. AstraZeneca working University Oxford one front-runners Covid-19 vaccine race. it‚Äôs one many pharmaceutical firms scrambling source containers critical bottling step. Executives AG Schott, one world‚Äôs major medical glass producers, recently told Wall Street Journal company received requests vaccine makers billion vials‚Äîdouble produce US three year contracts number companies hopefully produce enough vials equipment deal distribution. Finally someone nurse close family member one. opinion matters same. bet know nurse. Whatever happened Trudeau's blackface photos? First infections go up, hospitalizations, deaths.

I'm NYC metro area; I've rollercoaster before.

It's fun ride. Lol sure watching Global scorecard eye countries afford control it. Yeah totally normal./ Ahh, wife. Ask girlfriend? would fit White House OMG shut already. /s Developed Oxford intelligent healthcare system üëäüèª types stories scare looking jobs, college really think professors put that? think enormous crash fall logistical realities set in

Hope able find job feel safe performing know Bob Doug McKenzie. Speak yourself. Canada data generally reported public health unit and/or county level, would possible someone create better map.. seen one though 

 

 know virus symptoms right? exactly going catch virus taking test? go well virus stabilized brought additional crematoriums online address demand. Hahahahahahaha Wait, what?

Some media reports state FL CoV rates going UP. translate stabilizing?

FL's politicians denial like many citizens. want get infected think CoV hoax, let *their* choice.

Let reap sow! Wait sec... midst worst outbreak nation, issued emergency order *open* schools? sorry Floridians there, especially teachers school staffers. I‚Äôm sure happy see us divided! reality much higher case rates US rest developed world. imagine lack universal health care paid sick leave indeed play large role spread, know masks reduce spread. know cases go lockdowns business closures instated. know come things rolled back. people cannot make shutdowns happen, social distance wear masks control spread. fact masks made political statement ridiculous, agree people worldwide equally ridiculous. species, great dealing long lasting stress diffuse threat. 

Tying point, believe many people forced go back unsafe roles face exposure without proper PPE ran unemployment go back without pay insurance. know many workers regularly encouraged go work sick even pandemic. know personally many workers essentially quit employer would respond cases workplace. 

I also believe insidious political climate, tribalism almost, taken hold US recent years. movement polarized people believing science matter opinion instead fact also emboldened certain hateful contingent society feels disenfranchised. also plays hands would wish lower middle classes divided. However, also matter personal behavior needs addressed, mask neither conservative liberal. It‚Äôs medical device. Cases rising nothing common person adhere social distancing mask wearing guidelines, proven reduce transmission rates. wish us divided wouldn‚Äôt mind get sick buy drugs even die. It‚Äôs issue issue. fair cases high truly don‚Äôt know measures took March would enough Ron DeSantis living alternate dimension plain stupid? state red ways one wants open theme park? Sure spread everyone else 

This dude fucking moron. FL really wants peeing section COVID swimming pool. 20 years motor better electric, bill gates better taxed normally wealthy guy instead outrageously wealthy guy...or else tweet read ""global warming kill us all, ultra-rich flee mars"" ROFL Sorry corona virus can't tell difference really matter cause is. Skooter. agree. thought thing seen another article. something like 668 cases childcare centers something like 652... staff kids. nay sayers. doesnt mean F teachers. virus would get board plan. lockdown! Like anyone listening nimrod anymore. Hopefully remain months. really ""conspiracy"" NK 0 cases? feel like I've covid19rolled. think prefer Rick. arrested ‚ÄúI millions viewers‚Äù yet screen shows 80 viewers. wearing mask awhile go places either indoors packed people. find burden want wear mask think contrarian reason want jerk Maybe splice genes Banobo chimps. OK, can't argue that. Thanks info. people eat KFC get fat proximity, yes would support that.

I'm looking mechanisms protect stupidity, all. Plus weather. southern states getting hit right weeks deaths rolling positive tests past days. Basic logic math. üññüò∑ people reflect supporters, science denying, dishonest, immoral scumbags Insider hint.... repeated LOLs, experience, dead giveaway intelligence. fully capable passing someone would kill. We're fucked I‚Äôm left wing, go ahead look profile. However countries like U.K., Italy, Netherlands, etc. done thing I'm gonna waste much time going back forth one month old account, I'll ding 3 months see accurate hunch, assuming still check account 3 months. ""my freedom!"" Gypsies. would fastest vaccine history mankind. definitely don‚Äôt envy parents right even administrators making decisions. Yes, safety standpoint probably would ideal keep schools remote, many parents going run issue child care? 

There‚Äôs also issue kids falling behind can‚Äôt learn remote setting don‚Äôt resources successful remotely. mention kids missing sports/friends/socialization. sucks. Combined fact half experts also politically motivated basically screwed. r/nottheonion Wow, take long, reopened pubs. right. going pandemonium. Doubling stupid. lot areas going run face first ramifications living voting habits. costing US economy billions last weeks. able open people water masks virus gets control. 

All someone thought would win political points party. correct!  good health reasons decline invitation .

He could go anyway view trump treated canada him, I'm sure enthusiastic going.

If treat ppl like crap, expect nice effort you.

Personally, canada mexico, I'd trying (gradually maybe) business countries less USA. 

The latter damaged lot relationship usa canada. play devils advocate, many people truly zero illnesses True! Arizona snail's pace roll backs &amp; stay home order. Laughably (/s) asked weeks ago stay home ""over weekend"". leaders clueless &amp; understand numbers rise. anything help people can't work, work unsafe conditions risk fired. listen anyone talking reopening business requires go place mix people, putting life hands.

Ignore them. rhetoric powered ignorance economics staying closed worse people getting sick dying. fine cronies, it‚Äôs gonna suck family. plan riff basic plot Jurassic World, pretty good idea shelve inevitable catastrophic third act. better fully subsidized government....if charge loads money disaster. Sorry hear that. Stay safe good luck enforce order. 
What good mandate without enforcement?! Canada: 105,000+ infections. USA: 3,000,000+ infections. one could say chart perfect representation, certainly gets point across much accurately White House. would make perfect sense seeing populous state large margin. Texas worldmeter numbers headscratcher. someone explain nothing matches? (not) funny police officers power murder innocent black people, make people wear masks. bad can't use ""do whatever want penalty"" good use. Yeah, almost counties posted new cases. LA alone absent, quite concerning, half CA active cases right now. state collective death wish? That's works. bad right mean way worse tried mitigate earlier locking down.


There probably tens thousands people (or more) alive today could died locked all.

Do think lives worth nothing? mean lock ""for nothing""? looking level 1 spread, seems everyone, including media focused on. already dismissed protests. That‚Äôs danger.

I propose different way looking it. way pandemics actually work. know first case Covid-19? No. First 100? Hardly. wasn‚Äôt possibly thousands, even tens thousands infected noticeable uptick concern regarding g hospitalizations new illness.

This expect take least 3 levels spread (possibly 4) see direct impacts protests around country.

A person (level 1) attends protest gets infected. idea. spread friends, family, coworkers (level 2). infect level 3 folks, infect level 4 possibly around time level 1 level 2 starting get sick, may seek tests, others head hospital.

Keep mind theory. One backed following daily 6 months, reading reports, trying wrap head around slow-moving virus. I‚Äôm happy completely wrong. fact, would love to.

However, makes sad every time see mass media post protests impact cases all. provides everyone level safety. Reality is, don‚Äôt know yet. We‚Äôre still good 3 weeks away see cases start popping we‚Äôre connected protests levels spread (contact tracing critical here!).

Abstract

For first 3 months COVID-19 pandemic, COVID-19 expected immunizing non-relapsing disease. report national case series 11 virologically-confirmed COVID-19 patients experienced second clinically- virologically-confirmed acute COVID-19 episode. According clinical history, discuss either re-infection reactivation hypothesis. Larger studies including virological, immunological epidemiologic data needed understand mechanisms says 70 percent patients admitted die there. Yes still puppet administration. fact fired tells everything need know. lies less others kind hero here. Um. 

No fucking shit? bit numbers article context (from press briefing well):

Sweden 250 municipalities 1700 elderly residences across country. 70% deaths elderly housing occurred 40 municipalities municipalities report 40% cases ""do full conditions make individual assessments"". 91 elderly residences shown serious shortcomings first overview investigated details.

The total number people died elderly housing seen here: 2425 nursing homes 1277 home care 3rd July. total 68% total deaths Sweden yesterday's report 5433. doubling bet herd immunity?  


OK, we'll see goes.  


Nice see Florida experiment learn lessons. I've idea actual viral load healthy immune system handle, let's say, argument's sake, 1,000 individual viruses.

If get exposed 100 virus particles per day, every day 10 days, nothing happens.

If see 11 patients space hour, infects 100 virus particles, get sick.

If patient sneezes and, instead 100 particles via breathing mask close contact, get 10,000 particles, maybe get really sick.

That's doctors nurses getting sick: getting regular repeated exposure ""normal"" levels, either getting small amounts virus multiple patients, chances exposed super-spreaders like sneezer example. RemindMe! 17 days Obvious joke wear mask still admit anti-maskers better humans control lives? Downvote agree. correct. CA 4K cases Sunday. La would like 6-7k article isn‚Äôt true all. close all. can‚Äôt live doordash expedite bankruptcy filings. 6 months post vaccine we‚Äôll new businesses. going lead parade Main St?

Without mask? Indians could give us run like moment? Dying soaking hands poisonous chemicals, hey, least Rona. Fucking hilarious. anyone know endgame this? eventual vaccine? Everyone world wear masks years? able finally say ""it's over""? read (quickly), article makes pretty big logical leaps.

It talks sizes one viral molecule goes mask *all* viral molecules will. Think helium balloon: deflate time helium molecules *smaller* gaps balloon itself. logic article, balloon would deflate *immediately*. take days helium balloon deflate, brings next point:

I see mention article--again, read in-depth--about much virus takes infect someone. Experts said outdoor activities generally safe even without masks ventilation means exposure virus would *likely* short. That's important! experts *don't* say exposed all, say exposed **long enough** get infected.

A single viral molecule slipping sides mask even mesh **not** mean mask ineffective blocks 99 molecules. fact, would make 99% effective; exactly masks rated! N95 masks blocks 95% tested molecules--not sure tested top head.

The real question is: 5% virus air *enough infect someone*. Probably depends person level immunity. people shown immune virus without previous exposure. rare, course, happen.

But strikes article written though *exposing* hidden truth. truth that, beginning, experts open little known effectiveness masks. That's US mandate masks! Experts said available data inconclusive **or** trials flawed. article coming conclusion experts able come to.

Finally, author article PhD physics. Cool, he's epidemiologist. want Anthony Fauci teaching physics, teaching epidemiology. look expert advice, look experts field, experts fields. He's qualified draw conclusions here. Go home FWIW opinion perfectly possible go gym safely right now. area gyms re-closed, simply went every day hour closing like 5 people place, nobody ever within 15 feet part, set maybe 10 different people coming various combinations night, masks (too bad all).

It feels low risk I've perfectly fine far. think people quick say protests cause rise cases. Legit came type Timely Ok Denmark, Norway, Finland, Canada? need unfortunately people got case early volunteer exposed again. Pay shitload money, course. What's point? know going there. think commissioning daily differences positive tests bad metric used clicks. obviously deaths occurring cases occurring.

Oh really?

So explain rising since end May. look deaths. steady decline since mid-April.

So deaths? Let guess ... 2 weeks? know since January. Hospitalization curves death curves give pretty good estimates terms spread. reduce restrictions see effects.  Obviously better testing would help bit much. extra days one week lag testing observable serious cases much problem. far tracking see helps much all. have. Maybe say can, vote. massively misinterpreting statistic. OP isn‚Äôt saying 1.7% people age range contract coronavirus die. 1.7% people die coronavirus age range. incredibly small number people age range contract coronavirus die, likely 0.1%, according CDC. would make death rate lower seasonal flu, certainly acceptable number deaths accepted centuries. noticed: pic he‚Äôs making exact gesture alpha always makes, bigger hands üòÇ first published March 17. Updated June 22 ""But can't breathe oxygen properly die breathing carbon dioxide"" Heard times count. seriously goding acept vaccine took less year develeop put 3-4 times year ? 1st coronawirus vaccine, 2nd take years make sure safe, vaccines consider antivacers dumb af fakts Medical Researchers need realize window opportunity Co19 merely sore throat -

IT held check using macrolides naproxen preventing Pneumonia severe illness large % people.

2] Using 2 even 3 different vaccines per person give much better cross immunity different strains Virus .

  A] safest effective Vaccines given 4 6 weeks Person - 1st may give 60 80 percent immunity.
  B] Second Vaccine 4 6 weeks may boost immunity 90 % 95%.
  C] Third vaccine another 4 6 weeks may boost immunity 95% 98% etc. including various strains.

Booster shots may required every 2 years perhaps not.

There antivirals MUST administered patients reach high viral load. Virus spreads lungs.

There also antiviral inhaler possibilities - MUST really fight Medical Research Level - Medics seem really confused basic points - distracted strange non typical virus behavior RATHER bulk done SOON . You‚Äôre assuming silly amount things go ideally managed corrupt incompetent administration like 90 years.. You‚Äôre also assuming people recover antibodies, disease quit evolving different strains isolation stuff. even magically manage get hundreds millions doses produced 2021, supply chain problems, stacked top likely reality vaccine won‚Äôt free hundred million people likely wouldn‚Äôt get even could. 

I guess it‚Äôs nice hope whatever you‚Äôre setting disappointment. difference night day, metric imperial. Yeah wouldnt want America right Yeah, lots thoughts (rants) insulin. good example point, cost difference (and surrounding shadiness) patented versus generics. 

If Balsonaro (or Trump) promoting drug primary purpose get rich, enrich friends/donors, would pushing patented drug, something like HCQ off-patent available generics. come churches open country gyms aren't? church iron motherfuckers.

Don't envy position moment though, mental health streets certainly taken toll whole year (or maybe spot Northbridge), hope lead kind-of law-and-order crackdown. were/are really good thing state.

If ""we"" mean WAPOL, thank you. right community focus, even little things like laugh really helped get community board. Treat people adults respect, whilst also giving goal people see reasonable things, works wonders. want compare recent death figures.

Otherwise use excess death rates. You‚Äôre wrong. I‚Äôve tried wear mask eating gym failed. doubt that. think Trump honestly believes old Blood line: ""Anyone wears MARSK (misspelling purpose) public crim'nal!"" Dick‚Äôs near told day truck arrives called every week restocked. Scored pair heavy dumbbells, heavy kettle curl bar plates. 

I never thought would pay retail happy it! study done social distancing, hand equipment sanitation masks mandatory. US happening, recently went back gym see 30% wearing mask all, 30% wearing wrong (under nose) rest actually following rules. Holy shit, flu kill people! need shutdown entire world 20 years eliminate flu entirely. Lack empathy disdain expertise? everyone took seriously January, stuff still happening point.

But everything happening country entirely country's leadership. SK, Singapore got control quickly, took action early. USA, UK got hit bad, took action late. ...cause 5000 things we're worried get that. ever soul become adults? work heading aid company, we've going face shields possible, still block sound lip read. USA, case numbers decline, though last fortnight tough. See r/politics discussion this...they allow civil political discourse there....key word tough year. remember pleas apparent shock looting violence protests. Hope mild case.  little seen her, seems good person maybe good mayor. mention protests Covid pockets match up. file 1 day separate days mentioned another person's reply? meant things go safe police enforcing it, exactly right. hoping people coming state follow rules.

Which sorta point trying make, coordinated federal response would much good state even states working together.  full ride Case Western former defense attorney prof talked it.

He told law place people want change world going remain country. 

And entire legal system really designed serve monied interests. ""good"" ""ethical"" law thankless, soul destroying work help one.

Well China basically already dealt virus tests afterwards make sure yeah see ur point.. Interesting. dual citizen? would think .gov wouldn‚Äôt care long didn‚Äôt come back whole thing blows over. intention go Canada come back...I see Australia‚Äôs point. India? 1.3 billion people triple us population almost quintuple... 20k Covid deaths 130k.

We‚Äôre far worse country mile. Floridaman gets Floridaman voted ... Yeah, recall President Obama said something similar lucky 2009 H1N1 pandemic flu really mild. 

Unfortunately based many countries reacted slowly even approaching near denial severity COVID 19, think properly learnt lessons despite multiple close calls had. (SARS, Zika Virus etc) icmr said 15 aug date govt. confuse two.  Yes post /r/AntiMLM 

It makes sense. It‚Äôs another kind scammer, scammers rampant right now. China mix something then. brave. don‚Äôt think widespread hostility masks, issue expensive hard get. official advice wear one sick. directive wear one cheap available supermarkets think people would comply. Serious question..Why seal caves shut? Dr Falseci always repeating experts say days fact. He's useful news anchor. guess depends, university said get person classes winter, masks involved. want intubated strike fear people? scary fast things go bad .. Denmark re-opened schools mid April without masks. Things still going well them. Maybe go attend grand reopening. show everyone safe is. many politicians actually visited hospitals see really going on? that? Watch say. Vote out!! False positives rampant PCR testing. came say well.

It‚Äôs heartening see simple precautions like this, albeit personal cost. power sister wish well Local media reported symptoms coronavirus, fever. agree lot soon gloom here, think majority comes people want stay locked years antisocial issues. 

Fauci experts optimistic headlines portray them. see ""fauci optimistic vaccine fall"" read article says ""conceiveable"" results winter. timeline people expecting years faster anything done before, even though ahead still well known logistic supply chain issues ahead. 

Personally, think entire pandemic response sooner expects, regardless vaccine not. Perhaps working hospitals compulsory everyone little while. form National Service, will. 

It might wake people reality disease importance good, basic hygiene protocols. mention first hand appreciation hard work involved caring sick.

I can't stand sight blood, never have, idea makes rather uncomfortable. seems sensible beneficial national service military, example. Okay large outdoor concerts masks? Pretty well Canada. Lockdown mostly over, parks open, people able shop visit. took serious commitment community care people themselves. Denmark put kids back school mid April without masks. Things go wrong there. started 2016 actually. need look death rate. 2.79% - lot lower European Nations + US consider lot transmission within families people cohabitating makes sense. wave infected people lock stop spreading disease random people work interact with, transmission home continues keeps generating new cases beyond 14 day max incubation period. 2030 Coronavirus 2: Electric Bugaloo social distancing wear mask strikes back!!!

They amount danger teachers. coronavirus subreddit. student visum something skip asylum application level stupidity exactly haven‚Äôt gone church decades. realize pandemic over. first Australian lockdown worked without masks. see lots interest  whole time! flip flopping masks beginning... Wow, know would risk lot, hell even greater reason strike. going do, take away teaching cert every teacher state? Can't hire scab scab licensed. 3rd wave? happened 2nd? Monday, several doctors said governor's response virus helped create state feels torn two realities. Doctors described entire hospital floors sick patients battling virus unlike they've seen. But, beyond walls hospitals, witness many Tennesseans continue everyday lives ‚Äì misinformed, mask-less seeing, everyone else is, large numbers young people becoming critically ill,‚Äù said Dr. Murray Arons Skyline Medical Center Nashville. ‚ÄúAnd thing frustrates leave hospital enter world many people say, ‚ÄòWell, know virus there, don‚Äôt really think worse flu.‚Äô ‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs message, sent many leaders, gives people idea really Jeffrey Wright, works Baptist Memorial East Memphis, said treated 40-year-old rancher survived coronavirus left weak walk three-week hospital stay.

Yeah, whole guy‚Äôs argument smells like fecal matter. That's kicker me. Give time table. continue say ""wear mask never go outside"" without qualifying long event bring end. they're asking sacrifice, give light end tunnel.

Oh, apply rules evenly too. massive rallies donald's need end.  impression care population. 

It's expensive fight. easier frame China-virus, supporters agree vote you, opposers never going vote cannot convince supporters otherwise. Purely political. Psycho countries yet even start wearing masks. can‚Äôt even... I‚Äôm dead üíÄüíÄüò´üò´ü§£ Would feel comfortable working surrounded people flu virus? Using equipment right breathing air. think remember reading evidence Chinese government aware virus risk humankind general undesirability spreading throughout world, early October November 2019. 

They used considerable influence straight lie attempt cover suspected origin covid 19. However, restrict international travel Wuhan Province, therefore covid 19 lengthier headstart spreading countries around world. Infected persons absolutely protocols follow and, thus, spread virus even more.

So, China bunch secretive booboo faces, virus virus could contained much sooner. Maybe would epidemic, pandemic.

Also, there's conspiracy theory floating around 7 doctors Wuhan able break red wall alert world dangers Covid 19, China would continued cover eventually attempted remove trace virus China. would attempt place false origination place virus. Either because, a) virus man-made Chinese lab way China rule world, muhahaha... Oh shit. b) China making huge strides ditching poor, rural, uneducated, unmodern image. guess felt virus possibly came eating unregulated wild meat could kill significant amount people bad PR.

It help within month 7 Chinese doctors dead, reportedly due covid 19 complications, help feed monster.

Now, that's really last remember heading it. right around schools closed whole lot free time read Chinese coverups, etc. Also, Trump big, ""blame China, blame WHO"" kick, know information I've shared ever verified media fodder.

But would've trouble regardless. see difference 2 months would make regards seriously US responded. % would say wearing correctly covering nose? I'm amazed many people cover nose. They'll wear mask, bothered learn use correctly. said that, see problem continue slowing spread winter months people‚Äôs immune system weakened? I‚Äôd fear we‚Äôd higher death rate. least we'll first herd immunity! 

&amp;#x200B;

At point hope virus mutated less lethal stealthy form due lockdowns. Looking Florida. Pick safe assuming grocery store supply chain safely handling goods. spray items rubbing alcohol case.

Masks mainly protect others still give decent amount protection. much better nothing all.

Walking outside pretty safe. go far open air unless make point stand one place downwind sort coronavirus source that's also one place long. learn country Australia learned from, one locked 20 cases 2 million tests week. It‚Äôs going happen everyone sooner later. countries flattened curve eased restrictions spiking again. Economies collapse soon. !RemindMe 30 days That's good know i'm one. friends vacation right now, others already booking Disney trips, cousins go every single night bars, casinos, house parties. am, afraid even get takeout. 2 different worlds struggle every day thinking fuck get here, fuck people anything it, worse going get gets better? :/ thinking Santa Clara County well, recently I‚Äôm pretty sure covid, guess I‚Äôll never know...

In early March coworker worked closely tested positive. 3-4 days later, started experiencing pretty odd symptoms. symptoms included:

-one night waking shivering whole bed/body drenched sweat

-headaches (I rarely get headaches)

-extreme anxiety (I‚Äôve never experienced anxiety prior)

-extremely heavy chest (I wouldn‚Äôt say shortness breath, difficult normal take deep breath)

-shoulder pain (don‚Äôt ask why)

-loss taste / smell

This early stages covid...I called kiser &amp; told none symptoms covid related symptoms, long running fever I‚Äôm fine. unable give test time shortage tests, flu-like symptoms. symptoms lasted 3 days, loss taste/smell lasted 5 days.

I quarantined room 14 days straight, &amp; one household ended experiencing kinds symptoms.

I didn‚Äôt experience life threatening symptoms, never felt way life. reason believe covid, early symptoms yet publicized connection covid, are. Especially loss taste/smell. congested all, really explanation. 

My coworker flown Italy mother laws funeral February, notified someone plane back states tested positive covid. coworker medically induced coma 3 weeks &amp; expected die covid. Luckily made full recovery.

Another coworker tested positive shortly after, basically flu-like symptoms week &amp; good that. crazy effects everyone differently Someone know closely local politician wealthy county highly educated people. One biggest complaints get office, aside unemployment, masks.

I've mostly stayed isolated entire pandemic, however volunteer polls early June. number healthcare workers (evident scrubs) would put mask right entrance required truly astounding. 

These kind people brush aside remark like ""they're uneducated"" that's clearly case everyone, mention plenty educated wear them. 

Anyway agree last sentiment, truly everywhere idea either. He‚Äôll probably blame China Obama talk count many death stop counting numbers go down. would amazed government got together enough ability separate positive cases others. administration. blogspot.com may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Yeah well China told everyone back early Feb aerosol main transmission method.

You know, back everyone busy claiming China lying pay attention? Well lockdown US well, overwhelm hospitals slow spread. 

The concern spreading winter months people‚Äôs immune systems compromised therefore risking higher death counts. RemindMe! 3 months Idiots literally don‚Äôt believe this. Facebook ‚Äúfriends‚Äù someone who‚Äôs playing even today made repost Facebook cdc done total misinformation. course didn‚Äôt fact check. saw post color background thought must legit since one sharing Twitter. course took hardly anytime see false info shared fact. 
I sick people dumb! least research information legit sites. Article dated March 17th also don‚Äôt know are. assume US based fact don‚Äôt mention location. 

But whatever purpose locking come surprise anyone, open virus suppressed sufficiently you‚Äôre gonna problem. Melbourne going lockdown tomorrow night least 6 weeks. Schools shut term 3. allowed leave house work, food, medical exercise.  true. Amongst ivy leagues, Harvard notorious grade inflation. Grade median A-. ivies however grade deflation. Alot classes huge curves giving us extra letter grade boost compensate low averages lmao people adamant eating indoors restaurants? fucking food matter eat it. difficult pull drive-thru? extra lazy even delivered directly house.  Question: beginning tests done people hospitals ones worse symptoms broad population?

This way, expanding tests people mild symptoms even asymptomatic would younger people pool flu season starts tsunami time Depends policy. UK flatten curve overwhelm, wait virus non-existent.

But lockdown, whole country. gradual easing. people made aware virus. Daily briefings, constant news coverage etc.

The USA acted uniformly lockdown that's lot problems come from.  Wow, first heard coin shortage! makes sense [when wow, unexpected collateral damage. live different continent I'm wondering that's self checkouts switched card-only, like ones cited article. people like behave play outdoor games. future! Tell Florida. They‚Äôre saying Disney World reopening weekend... reading way much two sentence post somehow still reading want read. freaking even post.

 Bail unfair everyone can't pay forced jail full sick people. Potentially guilty something way avoid going isnt convicted something (not something said) LIKE getting death sentence everyone sick. money pay bail escape possible death illness either. broke system. Many states moving away bail reason.

I feeling either troll, upset many people disagree ego let back down, way literal internet understand even common sayings (which again, say 2 sentence post) I'm dropping here. right opinions deaf others'. okay one agrees never made posts actually supports idea. Also, devolving point ""all y'all stupid"" point make.

Have good day stay safe. Literally thread stated making claim unsupported.. ""Why many people denying role protests causing increase spread? It‚Äôs baffling."" Hey man. I‚Äôm Florida live nyc. Even I‚Äôm still taking seriously mom back Tampa pretty much page you. Everyone back normal life family still house. It‚Äôs crazy many people grew acting like it‚Äôs nothing... Yes, believe case school. shitty kids think use sick day save go school sickness entire day potentially make classmates sick :/ 10,000 cases day Florida ‚Äòstabilized‚Äô must virgin. over, try Canada Europe. ideal means, least there's health insurance laws protect employees. ramping India. probably worst hit time said done. difference excess deaths 2017 2019 happened around January, model expected deaths. 

The excess deaths 2020 happened March April, model expects fewer deaths due seasonal variations.

And jump conclusion model wrong excess deaths four winters row, excess deaths three previous years attributed flu deadly years. yes fuck tRump Esco Town!!! fewer people dying fewer people dying. good thing. cause celebration. 

If next month national death rate half now, two states deaths rising, people still panic mode, people say ""Things getting better!""?

Its logic everywhere *except* arizona, florida, texas, south-carolina terrible, 4 states good say ""Things great!"" tried book test dodgers stadium location 7-10 days ago wasn‚Äôt even listed. disappeared. wondering deal is. Regardless whatever they‚Äôre saying closed 4 days true. It‚Äôs site week. one become expert pandemics? age well   /r/noahgettheboat Ehh, agree comment terms qualifier used - ‚Äúprioritise‚Äù.

It depends, suppose, meant ‚Äúkick virus‚Äù. 

But providing vaccine-assisted partial immunity susceptible virus *first* dramatically immediately improve situation across board.

Of course many receive vaccine, should. 

But terms prioritization event initial scarcity, vulnerable, and, preferably, live and/or healthcare elder care workers first line, would make significant immediate difference. Well try one then:
I've almost certainly already March: mild disease me.

Therefore

1. I'm bothered point wearing mask prevent getting - case anything fully fitted N95+ mask going do.

2. I'm immune time anyway according research passing point wearing mask point view infecting others.

Not surprisingly never worn mask - (other DIY home woodwork machining!) propose, open negotiation virus go ""so like, give us three days allow people apartment blocks stock stuff, we'll water tight lockdown pretty please?"" Remove final `/` link. Sure, scientists allowed opinions virus, I‚Äôm allowed mine. It‚Äôs free country bub! Ya and.. there's evidence so..? Science common sense, fact finding company work salaried staff sick pay, put first stage disciplinary we're sick often. never understood disciplined ill, like ""right again"". nothing pleasing right-wing nutjob spreading conspiracy theories virus later suffering it. yeah uneducated knucklehead rioters really fucked everything up. average American objectively much dumber compared rest world Well that‚Äôs get slow spread winter season wouldn‚Äôt mean deaths? Considering people‚Äôs weakened immune system. 

There may bleak evidence summer heat may contribute low mortality rates well mitigation efforts implementing businesses. France, Alsace around Mulhouse (Haut- Rhin), mortality nursing homes (EHPAD) around 30% total March April. Ehpad medicalised nursing homes dependant ederly people. hit severly shortage masks, gloves, protective gear lack tests.

One hope : that, virus less disappeared Alsace (7 cases yesterday) 221 people still hospital Covid (for maximum 1200), 12 ICU (for max 163). Oh sure can. eat everything straw. farms there. still farmworkers, trucks &amp; stores distribute food. think way things way feed people wrong. Yes, scientific community still waiting pieces information. Also, effect pregnant women.

The vaccine certainly available much earlier answers. thing is, lot *know* people, give shit.

They think people ""at risk"" stay home, oblivious fact lot simply *can't*, virus - *mostly* affecting ""at risk"" people - still really care hurts.

It kills maims people indescriminatly.

Their collective lack compassion fellow man *everyone's* undoing. Unfortunately anyone that's tenured get black balled university. point lockdown suppress lockdown could contract trace hone outbreaks happen. There‚Äôs stoping virus get cases low enough slow masks isolating people areas outbreak. Assuming you‚Äôre US... virus never suppressed, plateaued eagerly reopening. actually weird disregaurd masks. hard explain given everything else we're doing. seem remember phases 1&amp;2 somewhat accelerated.

If them, play guinea pig. Billionaires losing money. That's it. Arrogance told entire lives live ""the greatest nation earth"" like somehow going leak brain via osmosis make smart knowledgeable fucking things masks basically seat belts 70s. People really anti seat belt laws came out. eventually, became accepted. sooner people accept masks, sooner economy reopen. policy aimed keep foreign students out, policy keep universities running campus fall comes. part administration's strategy restart system whether people like not. Florida, Texas, Arizona, maybe California digging mass graves September. someone explain tallying works? I'm correct, 1028 infections reported Orange County July 7, since tallying lags behind testing 1 day. 

Yet [OC reported 183 cases July counties report weekend. number come from? 183 people infected entirety holiday weekend? July 5 only? find either case hard believe. symptoms vary person I've personally seen younger mild symptoms get older worse , recovered pretty sick bit half June got pnumonia able get antibiotics etc stay home. Sister law wife daughter recently mom sister different levels. could go explain wanna bore details. Wait, football field area, meters length.

Apples oranges, no? Yep. happened around 80 others university. College Arts &amp; Sciences got rid every single department staff member. creating ""service center"" 3 admins 18 employees cover needs 19 departments. faculty help office. departmental presence...the offices dark empty. would 24 years dept August. chemistry faculty bust asses teaching, researching, getting grants...they deserve support. shit show least football basketball coaches get 500K fine. Jacksonville here. keep corona spikes (if haven‚Äôt seen fml). students provided laptops WiFi zero cost back February/March. schools decided let kids keep now. could literally start online fall zero issue. going hybrid plan originally, today teachers, students, parents, etc. found otherwise. It‚Äôs late game many teachers consider employment elsewhere. truly sickening. üòû point many places stayed open necessarily essential businesses. proposing similar China. * Florida's number cases doubled (from ~100k ~206k) last 14 days

* state's single-day record 18,157 cases 6/28 higher state's record. Higher NY, CA, TX, AZ, anybody

* record higher bottom 17 states (also DC Puerto Rico) recorded *during entire pandemic*. Looked another way, bottom 8 states -- HI, MT, VT, AK, WY, WV, ND -- **combined** whole pandemic.

So... stability come in?

*(all numbers referenced c/o Infection2020.com)* think WWE cares people? Even lying that, 10,000 cases day hospitalization numbers climbing quickly? yes, now, that's headed No. make claim either make argument provide evidence. 

For instance. According NY Times 4700 separate protests within last four weeks. That‚Äôs millions pellet street. go dozen google image searches protests you‚Äôll see lots photos people wearing masks. even masks aren‚Äôt full-proof. 

There hasn‚Äôt contract tracing data released regarding protests. may never be. it‚Äôs common sense people steer led spread. NANI KORRE!?  much FREEDOM Florida? Look graphs china's cases. Compare country. Come back report findings. Well lockdowns implemented kill virus stop virus overwhelming hospitals?

That could make hero need, hero deserve Agreed, hard lockdown best didn‚Äôt know going it‚Äôs time experiment see allow economy operate can‚Äôt. apparent indoor vs outdoor settings. 

But don‚Äôt think anyway avoid second wave winter. point discussion Netherlands too. normal, non-pandemic times, there's shortage ICU nurses intensivists (doctors trained critical care medicine) is. 
 
We looked upping number ICU beds countrywide. Turns there's little room purely staffing problems.  
 
And course train people - takes years. taking consideration fact 'normal' nurses also short supply, need experienced nurses ICU. 
 
The limited number ICU beds could made available one main reasons initial strict lockdown. article

That mainly impacts Presidential race DJT Joe Biden. states, next elections Governor take place 2022. (In states whose Governors responded pandemic inadequately, commonly believed Governor thinks ""all blow 2022 effect re-election all"") Safer Latin America, third world countries Bay Area we‚Äôve compliant pretty much orders. roll west coast style. area especially people healthy smart, wearing mask least do. sure mask wearing thing, put on. Wonder people refuse wear condoms doesn‚Äôt feel good keeps chlamydia spreading causing unplanned pregnancies. Masks mandatory live, combined standing away people normally would, yelling conversations becoming everyday thing. kinda funny. San Antonian here. Mayor Nirenberg right side pandemic (shame even say that), since beginning. bad breakout initial lockdown Mayor Nirenberg pushed hard people stay safe even sued CDC early taking lax attitude covid patients brought san antonio (we infectious disease center south side).

It looks like caution pointless though Governor abbott completely undermined efforts opening state early requiring masks.

We probably would escaped pandemic relatively unscathed lockdown order kept place.

""You realize 4% people die""

I know back pedaling, that's real shame. lowest common denominator US means mercy people stopped learning ANYTHING

Yeah basically, guns. 10% population foolish gonna keep us busy. Vote who? act two main choices way universal health care. Im sure there‚Äôs nothing worry hundreds thousands students crossing country congregate colleges won‚Äôt required wear masks /s like, DeSantis' car stopped working, think could fix patriotic brave whatever trying drive; would understand needs person qualified evaluate fix cars.

No, he'd buy new car. he's effectively Florida: care people die, he's worried keeping business going money keeps rolling got cancer, bet bippy he'd Mayo Clinic Johns Hopkins, exactly fuck told him. 

Steve Jobs famously ignored oncologists tried treat cancer special diet. start listening condition worsened point transplant. (Which paid get early &amp; jump ahead waiting list.) Rich people think money, leaders incapable understanding ideological fight, understand non-ideological fights contexts, even *medical* contexts?? 

Because them, *is* ideological fight. cares staying office &amp; raking money friends. Nothing else worth considering. long pander enough people &amp; make donors happy, that's he's going do. would pretty fucking stupid world leaders lol. vaccine early trial stages, know side effects long term impacts yet. know long Ive read posts/comments found someone 'competent' actually understands WTF going 'how'?

&amp;#x200B;

Shit...you running president!! 

Too smart job see, got good chance!! Feds helping nationwide coordination safety measures: masks, lockdowns, etc. possibly moving (medical) personnel needed. Covering costs treatment. Paying people continue paying rents/mortgages/etc.

The local level gets patchwork responses, everyone worked together, would nearly over. coherent, comprehensive nation-wide plan day one. Yes do. wasn‚Äôt right. seen around, yes. groups this, far between.

Who knows live music scene like. Profits venues going hard come vaccine released. economic impact industry, we're seeing tip iceberg right now. going rocky road next years. Well racists want blamed spreading Faux News Faux News Flu. *Americans 

FTFY probably getting downvoted selfish ignorant american peers. get upset anything threatens freedumb. totally agree you. wish u.s. government took actions others. honestly could believe FL, Georgia, Texas etc started opening barely even locking down. 

 Ontario even question opening rates seeing there. tiny % people calling it. follow multiple conservative facebook groups (Ontario Proud - im con, important keep people side saying). 90% people group supporting provincial (con) federal (liberal) governments lockdowns. 

What get people think functioning economy deadly virus running wild? Good! Well, Eurovision. let's sure hop onto plan letting insurance companies sell policies across state lines, shop least powerful regulatory bodies. fan. Can‚Äôt stand hear talk. honestly know mean math math. math referring to? innumerable ways study could flawed, none math. know culture lot LGBT people ban travel, right? cars road ""modern close 100% safe"", yet would still wear seatbelt 80s car.

When comes masks, nobody wears mask, nobody wears proper masks. everybody wears masks, least part wearing proper masks. Also, even bad mask prevent direct spits saliva somebody coughing, reducing spread. contaminate air around instead directly coughing droplets people front them.

Also masks prevent people touching faces hands (something people many times day without noticing). also prevent people gathering bars/restaurants - can't exactly eat/drink mask on. Every single protester wearing mask. numbers show protests cause uptick Covid numbers. Racism major crisis USA, including public health crisis. live know like day day Black people country. essentially POGRAMS, like Eastern Europe leading Holocaust. comments show racist anti-semitic dogwhistles probably care much. thousand thousands thousands care LOT. ‚Äúis entering third wave‚Äù

bs title - HK waves. Loss smell taste strong predictor Covid, keep basic precautions anyways 100%. Antibody tests reliable enough maybe we'll get cell testing someday. Take care. Glad coworker made it! Sharknado believable became totalitarian society. 

lol shouldve asking black people whole time You‚Äôve got skin game. expect kids pay criminal. Completely different viruses. church uses Zoom. assume us like this. think remember reading evidence Chinese government aware virus risk humankind general undesirability spreading throughout world, early October November 2019.

I've following remember (from February, iirc) evidence local Chinese officials semi-aware virus want *the Chinese government* know would bad career ‚Äì censored Chinese doctors trying alert rest country (possibly world, think early stage). two doctors tried brave censorship transferred frontlines least one conveniently died covid, posthumously made hero.

So, yes, coverup, far understand, China vs. world, much less interesting mid-level officials vs. higher ups cover-your-arse.

If everybody done job, yeah, world would probably started *ignoring* covid months earlier, we've basically ignoring ebola, dengue, previous sars everything else happened far away. Yes, stage, I've grown rather cynical. Unfortunately, even best vaccine manufacture fastest. 

I doubt many people governments nations trust all. Muh 5g americans sensible. I'm trying insulting here. seems guys one-or-the-other. Either full lockdown masks hiding home, ignore everything, make strangers, congregate cafes churches etc. 

Swedish authorities handed instructions. Basically wash hands, keep distance, visit grandparents right now, work home can, avoid public transport possible, overall people follow them. dont covid-denying protest movement. people intentionally trying get infected ""get with"" etc. 

By large population mostly taking seriously avoid getting sick, shows stats. would ended Wednesday anyway decision based ""on money"", fact new measures coarse. mindless Laschet sloppy again, nothing new. blighter can't anything right. Yeah basically it. Never heard term English! Agreed, man always total butthole. norhing wife getting everything? lol we'll learn live it

Atleast save money probably life. using wrong analogy friend. ( maybe lot) Americans would try fix car think ended parts everywhere giving nothing fitted back together.

That's real American (car fixing) mentality. beating every first world country twice week Well, reported kind aggressive anti-posts never got single reply allowed, whatever ... comment like ""Swedes, give em cm, take meter"" civil. deaths increase exponentially?

That's lockdowns, prevent happening. Yikes Good news real question is, ever make kids pay much college...college free. now. yet Let's crystal clear world wearing masks back January February, nobody cared people buying stuff shipping China. 

Furthermore, China increased PPE production 12x couple months lockdown, gone since - that's China exporting again.

As global spread, looking like China first outbreak, necessarily origin. community transmission France mid-December, present Brazilian sewage back November. ridiculous imagine China could contained disease even identified it. We're ever getting first wave, we? Deaths lag positive cases.

Apologies all.
 know better trust ability skim article waking couch body fighting fever.

(Guess pint Guinness cure work tonight). still students university take courses home country? so, see problem. Thing is, they'll actually able live campus. Well, fall semester freshmen juniors, spring semester sophomores seniors.

But classes online. students able come network - except foreign students visa, get option. think easy people without toddlers, without multiple kids, without children disabilities come conclusions. making assumption alternative children, sit home cuddly houses parent perfectly attentive, supportive encourging. sit four five hours day ensure they're attentive completing school work. 

That far reality, kids pushed corners daycares. Many get little education.  Many houses parents work parents speak English can't help kids wanted to. Children disabilities lose sorts therapies desperately need. Parents toddlers multiple children can't 4 computers set time monitor activities four computers 5 hours day. Do.You know many times I've heard neighbors yelling kids shut f up, get F away me, live affluent neighborhood snuggly parents norm. Tempers thin, emotions high there's lot instability lot kids right now.

The extremist situation presented really hard circumvent. Masks required walking halls riding bus. able removed classroom. children always crayon box, there's reason share crayons.  risk exposure inherent, Teachers held accountable students catch Coronavirus. 

Most parents already instilled fear children, school would making worse. Even 3-year-old perfectly articulate word Coronavirus tell is.  Certain things distracting certain things take away efficient education is, everything changes adapt. 

 Schools giving people choices too. parents comfortable sending kids back, to. There's virtual school digital school kids sit front computer 5 hours day class kids school.

I think parents need decide what's best kids. could easily move another country right would. Honestly mind going Canada point. much tying I'd need find employment. U.S. sinking ship man. breaks heart. Good guys dying trying save us all, folks disregarding everything know keep safe. several reasons work. ideal world, would open everything trust people right thing. However, instead live world right somehow politicized pandemic. right leaning students disregard threat think whole thing hoax. know they're gonna troll students wearing masks, washing hands, care many people interact with. Many carriers.

If goal eradicate coronavirus, need everything possibly stop spread.

Mandating face masks would greatly reduce transmission rate everyone N95, perfectly sealed, utmost discipline touch face socialize anyone all. packed like sardines dorms. reality, people cloth masks. They're much better nothing, many people slip either become carriers, fall deathly ill. 

Opening things prematurely, like Florida Texas did, cause pandemic spread. cause businesses close, remain closed, people die, damage economy. 

There tangible benefits opening schools, even restrictions suggested. benefits? people bottom keep jobs, sure. students receive quality education, okay. even one person dies, worth it? one, it'll certain percentage entire population.


Now let's say open heavy restrictions. stick MOSTLY online classes, (except maybe labs cant avoided) fewer people campus. means transmission rate lower, couple cloth masks, testing, contact tracing, swift individual quarantines inevitable happens, maybe numbers lower. still people underlying condition likely die suffer life long effects.


But wanna stamp virus, stopping spread key. Sticking online effective solution least amount casualties, least damage economy, fastest path eradicating coronavirus. I'm student, online classes frustrating, family died want anyone needlessly expose thing need to.



If still understand would bad open everything up, look make mathematical models pandemic. See understand suggestion would increase transmission rate. 3Blue1Brown excellent math channel, Numberphile. made videos youtube analyzing mathematics pandemic.

Now, conditions have, addition taking people jail for, essentially, poor post bail, also killing slave labor.

This system fucked orbit. Canadian here. We're almost phase 3 reopening. Nobody paid cent testing treatment. guys hate universal health care much? going happen America. Many die. Jesus it‚Äôs mask.

Please take offer, could use easy money. Considering already manufacturing vaccine testing, woundit take 2022 widespread immunization? vaccine available someonein first half 2021, would take almost year deploy? scare tactic, truth.

We vaccine awhile, virus going go away own. indisputable. meantime, masks social distancing two best tools keep hundreds thousands at-risk people alive.

I understand many people trying hard think reason wear thin piece fabric wonder much mask refusal people think well we're fucked anyway might well live normally?

Also, people think like stupid people. ""We're fucked I'm wearing mask, I'm going wear mask, we're fucked I'm wearing mask, etc."" people resigning entire country failure? Every country fine, they're wearing masks. know recently, people thinking coming 5G various countries destroying towers, anti-lockdown protests happening countries.

I'm sure people world think conspiracy, media tends focus ones America. Yep, wear mask gym too. first thing arrive last thing leave thoroughly wash hands soap. wipe every piece equipment disinfectant use it. keep distance members, following rules gym instituted. even disinfect bottoms shoes I'm finished.

Working *is* important health, unlike going bar. feel lot safer gym, even situation 100% safe.  Like speeding stopped happening.  fearless leader said slow testing. openly hides shit. much people think Rain man Let‚Äôs assume second reinfection possible (by means assured/likely hypothetical).

Pervasive audited regions oxygen therapy cannot offered case shortness breath conjunction covid-19 elderly, drug treatment opioids therefore primarily prescribed palliative care.

Hallengren critical region's message elderly people must taken hospitals geriatric care receive oxygen treatment. 

- nothing say move person - individual assessment, says Lena Hallengren, pointing National Board Health Welfare previously lifted fragile people elderly care moved little often. 

On Wednesday, announcement also came [Ivo, National Inspectorate Healthcare Care, starting larger supervision elderly care includes access oxygen treatment]( authority received signals many elderly people elder care homes lack access oxygen treatment, part National Board Health's recommendations palliative care. Ivo also examine individual care needs met, medical needs investigated, even elderly elder care homes deemed need hospital care. 

- serious true DN writes, also get - elderly receive care would need, turns made decision correct medical basis. Even pandemic, extremely important guidelines care elderly followed. Ivo reviews important, says Lena Hallengren. 

**In Norway, care taken equip elderly care order able offer oxygen elderly homes event shortage connection covid-19, unlike Sweden. say that?** 

- can't comment choose Norway. Sweden shortage oxygen, care centers intensive care centers. find difficult see end position oxygen cannot offered elder care homes. course, matter competence, also applies normal cases. all, palliative care activity meets sick old people habit caring palliative care. 

[DN also revealed]( elderly people put palliative treatment opioids covid-19, following decision physician phone, without relatives informed, without meeting patient. treatment initiated, criticized experts, [Yngve Gustafson, professor geriatrics]( , believes **the elderly subjected ""cocktail opioids"" likened active euthanasia**.

Man time really flies.  federal state government needs find funding assist parents home care kids. Natural progression virus.

Most studies showing week infection first symptoms, maybe another week symptoms progress hospitalization required, another week hospital vitals lungs fail, eventually getting put vent another week two die recover. 

These approximate timelines, detail virus works. You‚Äôre looking 4-5 week timeline progression infection either death recovery.

Early pandemic, weren‚Äôt testing people hit ‚Äúneeds immediately hospitalization vitals dropping‚Äù stage, usually requiring immediate ventilation likely death within 1-2 weeks.

Now, catching cases earlier soo lag might like 2-4 weeks positive test actual death. point time, though. numbers press conference 6/7, ones link 7/7.

People like make everything political annoying fuck. first wave?

This is: shows quite extensively protests didn‚Äôt contribute spike 3 weeks later. doesn‚Äôt also say it‚Äôs ‚Äúless reliable‚Äù... First world economy third world public service infrastructure, sounds right say, everything's better Texas. Even pandemic. measure physical space meets certain (equipment?) criteria? metric ""available, fully staffed beds""? metric thinly stretched qualified personnel number physical beds? Like, ideal staff/beds, absolute worst case staff/beds, two? thought Mexico pretty well, they‚Äôve closed border Arizona Mexico don‚Äôt want infected Americans would explain death rate dropping.

Based know, death rates ~.4% round 1/2000 &lt;60yos, ~10% ~1/10 curve, reasonable averages.

Now let's eyeball population ~80% 60. 

~330m people*.8 = 264m people 60yo. 

~66m 60.

Expected deaths 100% infection rate:

264m/2000= ~132k deaths 60yo

66m/10= ~6.6m deaths 60.

But 100% likely. So, expected deaths 65% infection (""herd immunity""):

264m*.65/2000 = ~85,800 deaths &lt;60yo.

66m*.65/10= ~4.29m deaths 60yo That‚Äôs exactly happened me! heck wonder ? would rather seen resolve defy governor interest public health things went backwards unnecessary people got sick died. That's surreal af acid trip. Right time herd immunity. common Taiwan too, I'm surprised big deal US. ignoring old ‚Äúno shirt, shoes, service‚Äù signs everywhere decades? death rates Texas states go up, fault doomers keep talking increased case counts hospitalizations saying link things near-future deaths. Everybody knows hospitalizations fun!! People go personalized attention, great food, price break living expenses.

Doctors medical scientists caused viruses studying them, viruses deep state scientists forced thoughts bodies.  Conan hard worker brilliant. able accomplish life shows 1% people extremely talented self driven. Neil deGrasse Tyson said astrophysics classes Harvard easy would also take grain salt. NGL.... easier eyes ol' spicey Montana. also much lower population though. living person. mean, would obviously right call make, even much prude make it. Massachusetts, supposed peak 3-7 days NY, happen. thought gonna happen week after, happen. week that, finally peaked took full month lockdown numbers hit peak (towards last week April).

But think also means flattened curve models predicting. Everybody wears masks I've seen past couple weeks, mask-usage seems gone news got around places like AZ FL reaching exponential growth. seems like ton people got spooked complacency. Study sponsored gym owners... Take care yourself. Try read news. Rest, hydrate. Eat, can. Pay attention body doing. you‚Äôre able, buy oximeter, check O2 sats. 88, below, get hospital. Keep eye temperature, too. certain point (103.5 personal limit), want work bring down. primary care doctor, let know, haven‚Äôt. Find nurse line, don‚Äôt doctor. want able ask someone guidance. used ask mom, ER nurse. üòå

I experienced lot weird nervous system issues caught covid. delirium went on, days. It‚Äôs different everyone, thing really runs gamut, symptoms. scary breathing problems. example, apnea developed, overnight. still stuff come up, like massive fatigue. Fevers much. said, fianc√© almost symptoms, rolled right it. kids fine, too. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Statistics side. Seriously, get rest. Don‚Äôt push. can‚Äôt much else, anyway. Focus healing. things enjoy, you‚Äôre able to. Anything uplifting good. played video games, could sit up, function, again. 

I read articles limited data had, scared shit myself, even already was. super bright. don‚Äôt recommend it. Much turned inaccurate, thankfully. üòå‚ù§Ô∏è Thank much still careful, leaving ICU beds open us who've careless. I'm sorry that, &amp; I'm staying home/away others gratitude. may rest power Rip fucking hope not. ruin lives everyone forever fucking worth it. Wait, target sells masks now??? get one, need buy more. Science medicine found prayer faith rather comforting times stress, actually.  Nationwide deaths record lows trending down... got home moisture buildup mask, felt like caught cold (runny nose etc) took cold meds went bed early, felt ok next day. I'm careful now. pull mask partly outside (breathe nose outside mask) one nearby, pull someone approaches. need apologize! really weird English indeed lol actual way say Brazil. Fatiga (fatigue) also commonly used though. No, college suggesting pass yearly savings campus shutdown back students. expect lawsuits. Sometimes deep existential terror greed bf gotten two antibody tests three months apart recovering.

Make red mask. 
Slap MAGA KAG it.  
I'm left hell even country, want pandemic slow point wreck world economy bodies start piling up.  shoot anyone talking "" fearing life"" sure decision resulted tens thousands deaths, certainly terrible move doesn‚Äôt get nearly enough blame it. Apparently Trump alone blame every single American death. can't even imagine hard must families. hate sound selfish, I'm glad family worry right now. Wow, I‚Äôm asking something backs claim FDA going slow vaccine process Oxford vaccine, FDA protocol - completely aware thing. argument FDA monitoring results vaccine (which already human trials) fast track American Citizens without rigorous testing process. yes plenty back many articles discussing US‚Äôs investment Oxford vaccine.. I‚Äôll let take reigns educate things currently it. theory since corona viruses mutate might act like dengue. survive dengue first time get get second strain kill you.  
No news sequencing samples found sewerage last year. would interest might mutated. 20k new deaths week 4th july? made correct prediction since NEJM article. He's talented man. worry guys. gonna go away heat Hey hey hey, said inject bleach drink it. Everyone knows drinking wont anything silly. People projection models absolutely project think happen. one knows happen sports stock market people still way projecting. Almost one Harvard pays full tuition. I'm taking US-centric approach tackle virus based variables exist today. perfect scenario, US could attempted policies worked Taiwan (of course would've never flown US, let's pretend) soon China walling cities order prevent spread virus country, ship long since sailed here. 

If examined issue carefully, stop virus mild symptoms vast majority carriers time incredibly infectious - way - already multi-million person foothold country? 

It simply pointless general healthy populace interacting elderly. course, (disclaimer) elderly comorbidities need approach virus utmost caution well anyone physically present around at-risk, predominantly elderly group. 

As anecdotal evidence, mono 20 years ago, immune system never fully recovered, relate long term effects. Yeah I'm sure epidemiologists would love happen patient people know already starting get antsy. doesnt get better year I'm sure theres gonna national feeling ""fuck it""  Confucianism guess? cannot done safely classes absolutely need class lab work. class online be, period. real. Months beating drum leave house kill people. Go see friend? killing people. Go park? killing people? Go beach? double killing people. Go giant overcrowded protests every day month? Yeah that's 100% fine! COVID magically spread protests stupid implying does! explain ever decreasing fatality? Lucky them. said, ""everybody wash hands, touch face, stay home sick"", world upside down.

People ""sick"" still transmit virus. conditioning also spread virus. said, ""everybody wash hands, touch face, stay home sick"" - well, that's bad advice, would sufficient precautions prevent spread disease. Unless random sample testing (with 99.99% accuracy), C CFR bogus number. Sorry, statistician worth salt knows current # Cases absolute garbage metric misused world.

We know normalized CFR 0.2%, slightly worse flu, blanket SIP worthy...and yes agree SIP Apr, May absolutely necessary know true CFR.

SARS-CoV-2 induces robust gene expression functional changes platelets.

Platelet hyperreactivity may contribute COVID-19 pathophysiology increased platelet-platelet platelet-leukocyte interactions.

There urgent need understand pathogenesis coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). particular, thrombotic complications patients COVID-19 common contribute organ failure mortality. Patients severe COVID-19 present hemostatic abnormalities mimic disseminated intravascular coagulopathy associated sepsis major difference increased risk thrombosis rather bleeding. However, whether SARS-CoV-2 infection alters platelet function contribute pathophysiology COVID-19 remains unknown. study, report altered platelet gene expression functional responses patients infected SARS-CoV-2. RNA sequencing demonstrated distinct changes gene expression profile circulating platelets COVID-19 patients. Pathway analysis revealed differential gene expression changes pathways associated protein ubiquitination, antigen presentation mitochondrial dysfunction. receptor SARS-CoV-2 binding, ACE2, detected mRNA protein platelets. Surprisingly, mRNA SARS-CoV-2 N1 gene detected platelets 2/25 COVID-19 patients, suggesting platelets may take-up SARS-COV-2 mRNA independent ACE2. Resting platelets COVID-19 patients increased P-selectin expression basally upon activation. Circulating platelet-neutrophil, -monocyte, -T-cell aggregates significantly elevated COVID-19 patients compared healthy donors. Furthermore, platelets COVID-19 patients aggregated faster showed increased spreading fibrinogen collagen. increase platelet activation aggregation could partially attributed increased MAPK pathway activation thromboxane generation. findings demonstrate SARS-CoV-2 infection associated platelet hyperreactivity may contribute COVID-19 Cases up, tests death rate going down. Probably best case scenario, fearmongering needs end. topped, switched. Thank god, could 1 week earlier.   Oh wow, look corruption. idiotic bring health system down.

How Take Care Mask

Now you‚Äôve got mask, need take care it. Here‚Äôs advice washing reusing mask.

Can reuse medical mask?

Medical masks N95 masks saved medical workers, medical mask, know designed one-time use. However number scientists, led group Stanford University, studying best way sanitize masks extend life personal protective equipment used medical workers current shortage.

The problem washing sanitizing medical mask degrade it, making less effective. Scientists found using UV light, heat humidity hydrogen peroxide vapor could work, methods developed use hospitals special equipment home use. learn story efforts decontaminate thousands medical masks.

‚ÄúI would wary putting oven potential reach high temperature melt plastic fibers, thus damaging mask,‚Äù said Linsey Marr, leading aerosol scientist Virginia Tech studying ways extend life medical masks. ‚ÄúStudies viruses show inactivation 150 degrees Fahrenheit, lower many ovens go. that‚Äôs high humidity, humidity makes big difference. oven hit 150 degrees put pan water there, could effective, nobody tested method specific virus.‚Äù

If multiple masks, best strategy rotate use masks several days, gives time virus die. medical workers, one strategy keep set five masks, wear new mask every day return first mask sixth day.

‚ÄúThe safest thing might put mask somewhere safely reach,‚Äù said Dr. Marr. ‚ÄúOver days, viruses decay. fact, studies found viruses usually decay faster fabric porous materials hard materials like steel plastic.‚Äù

How care fabric mask?

It‚Äôs much easier clean fabric mask medical mask. C.D.C. says fabric masks ‚Äúwashed routinely.‚Äù mask experts spoke wash daily machine sink, using regular laundry soap. use dryer let air dry. Although it‚Äôs necessary, also go hot iron full assault germs might remain.

Just medical mask, chemicals like bleach hydrogen peroxide begin degrade fabric fibers, making mask less effective. Dr. Marr notes virus can‚Äôt replicate outside body, virus particles trapped mask, pretty well stuck decay removed washing.

‚ÄúWashing soap water work,‚Äù Dr. Marr said. ‚ÄúI throw cloth mask washing machine rest laundry dry low heat. would avoid bleach know degrade fibers. important thing avoid damaging fibers mask.‚Äù go:

What child refuses wear mask?

Masks worn children 2 years age. older children often vectors contagious illnesses, teaching wear mask good idea.

Teaching child wear mask, however, easier said done. Many children frightened masks don‚Äôt like them. Keep working it. try win child fun characters mask, rewards games. also convince setting example (the concept works children see eat vegetables.) Try turning mask craft project wear proudly.

Mask mask, children never go grocery store run essential errands pandemic. Community playgrounds closed (or be), outdoor play confined back yard. children need play public space, go somewhere easily keep distance people, like empty soccer field sparsely populated hiking trail refusal wear mask doesn‚Äôt affect people.

When wear mask home

A mask needed home someone sick. patient confined separate room minimal contact rest household (including pets) use separate bathroom possible. patient caregiver wear masks contact other.

Choosing Making Mask

Almost overnight, masks shapes, colors styles appeared faces around us. Here‚Äôs decide mask works best you.

Types masks

N95 respirator masks: masks fit tightly face highest filtration efficiency, blocking 95 percent particles 0.3 microns larger. N95 mask protects medical workers come contact high doses virus visiting carrying medical procedures multiple patients. rest us don‚Äôt need level protection, masks reserved health care workers only. learn masks work, check video animation Arizona State University Risk Innovation Lab.

Medical masks: also short supply used medical workers. Sometimes called surgical masks procedure masks, masks rectangular shaped coverings (often pleated) come elastic ear loops. Medical masks made paper-like nonwoven material, often given coughing patient waiting see doctor. Compared N95 mask, medical mask filters 60 80 percent particles and, according Food Drug Administration, mostly blocks ‚Äúlarge-particle droplets, splashes, sprays splatter may contain germs.‚Äù

Homemade fabric masks: Centers Disease Control Prevention recommends cover faces scarf homemade fabric mask public. effectiveness homemade masks varies depending fabric used, style fit.

In laboratory tests, homemade masks poor job, others rivaled filtration medical mask. another study, 21 people made masks T-shirts, researchers compared homemade masks medical masks. ‚ÄúBoth masks significantly reduced number microorganisms expelled volunteers,‚Äù although surgical masks better, wrote study authors. community studies, homemade masks found offer protection viral outbreaks.

You sew mask using number mask patterns circulating internet try no-sew pattern. We‚Äôve included links guide, ‚ÄúHow make mask,‚Äù below.

Picking material make mask

Remember, face covering better face covering. people experimenting homemade masks using air filters vacuum bags, average person doesn‚Äôt need level protection you‚Äôre practicing social distancing leaving house essentials. Given much variability fabrics, best advice start light test. Hold fabric mask light see much light gets through. tighter weave, less light you‚Äôll see, protection you‚Äôll get. Test fabric face make sure still breathe it, though.

Because shortage masks, aerosol scientists around country testing everyday materials see well might work homemade mask. time, compared amount size particles filtered standard used medical masks ‚Äî 0.3 microns. However, often-cited 2013 study University Cambridge used different standard, testing two layers materials using particles 1 micron. Linsey Marr, aerosol scientist Virginia Tech, notes 0.3 micron test higher standard, 1 micron test still useful helping people make decisions mask materials. ‚ÄúThere probably lot viruses 1 micron droplets/aerosols 0.3 micron droplets/aerosols,‚Äù said Dr. Marr. ‚ÄúSo even mask removes 20% droplets/aerosols 0.3 microns size, probably better 1 micron droplet/aerosols,materials testing.‚Äù

Here‚Äôs look everyday products studied homemade masks. find information story, What‚Äôs Best Material Mask?

T-shirts: us old T-shirt could cut no-sew mask. It‚Äôs one convenient fabrics use, lot variability well T-shirt material performs lab tests. Virginia Tech, single-layer old cotton T-shirt captured 20 percent particles 0.3 microns. captured 50 percent particles 1 micron. 2013 University Cambridge study tested two layers T-shirt captured 70 percent particles 1 micron.

Cotton quilting fabric: high-thread-count cotton fabric preferred quilters durability. studies Wake Forest Baptist Health, masks made quilting fabric rivaled filtration efficiency surgical masks.

Tea towels: Tea towels became popular source mask material August 2013 study researchers University Cambridge found material compared well medical mask 1 micron particle size. study authors note brand. towel used terry cloth, tightly-woven absorbent tea towel variety.

Pillow cases: Pillow cases good option sewers don‚Äôt fabric. 2013 study, 2 layers pillow case fabric tested close efficiency surgical mask 1 micron standard, study Missouri University Science &amp; Technology, took four layers 600-thread-count pillow case material achieve level protection 0.3 micron standard.

Flannel pajamas: two-layer mask flannel cotton one best tested Wake Forest Baptist study rivaled efficiency surgical mask

Coffee filters paper towels: C.D.C. suggests inserting coffee filter mask extra protection. Missouri University Science &amp; Technology scientists found using three coffee filters made difficult breathe. Adding layer paper towel two layers fabric could make homemade mask efficient. engineer air purifier firm ran test found single paper towel filters 23 percent 0.3 microns two paper towels filtered 33 percent. added paper towel homemade T-shirt mask.

Scarves bandannas: comes ease use, can‚Äôt beat scarf bandanna cover face. bandannas thin and, even folded four times, don‚Äôt offer much protection. Scarves may better thick hot. better nothing.

Filters vacuum bags: Scientists trying find effective alternatives medical workers cut layers air filters tested HEPA vacuum bags. work quite well, significant downsides. Air filters, cut up, release fibers dangerous inhale, filter material sandwiched layers heavy cotton fabric used mask. Vacuum bags good filters breathable. Plus, brands vacuum bags may contain fiberglass used cover face. I've said elsewhere, isolate elderly population comorbidities. Multigenerational households also high alert wearing masks, gloves, whatever, essentially limiting contact. Everyone restrictions, well yes, say go outside, get exercise. enough data show people minimal risk. pretty clearly documented median age death 80 around world (those people matter way, addressed above). 

And thing countries named going work realistically infection foothold high here. literally millions, maybe tens millions depending possible numbers mild asymptomatic cases. Remember, original strategy ""flatten curve"" everyone seems forgotten, stop cases virus.

Even minimal precautions, seen country like Sweden overwhelm healthcare system. tried Chinese demonstrated Wuhan barricading people homes cutting roads cities strategy stop spread? virus burnt there.  Bingo. could work letter/script calling politicians r/COVID19Resistance. problem can‚Äôt sure every student access internet tech. 191 new cases overnight lockdown. Props Australia understanding acting 100% proven way stay ahead virus. Great job! avoid 99.99% US going through.

Meanwhile... USA... Yeaaaahhhh... that... Case Masks

Overnight, masks become symbol social responsibility. still need convincing, here‚Äôs wearing mask public spaces prevent spread coronavirus.

Why masks matter coronavirus

To start, coronavirus new virus, means immune systems never encountered before. It‚Äôs different seasonal flu, us protection from, either previous exposure related influenza viruses got flu shot. One biggest worries health workers, get vaccinated stay well flu season, protection coronavirus.

It‚Äôs also important note flu season happens period several months. Coronavirus spread much rapidly, infecting concentrated number patients ‚Äî resulting tens thousands cases Covid-19 ‚Äî matter weeks.

An estimated 25 percent people coronavirus feel perfectly fine don‚Äôt know infected could contagious. guess what? could well one them! That‚Äôs wear mask protect people stealth germs.

How mask could protect others

Even simple mask effective trapping droplets coughs sneezes. recent study published Nature University Hong Kong University Maryland asked 111 people, infected various viral illnesses (influenza, rhinovirus more-mild coronavirus), exhale giant funnel. Sometimes noses mouths weren‚Äôt covered; times used simple, not-particularly-well-fitted mask.

Without masks, infected people exhaled contagious droplets aerosols, tiny particles linger air, 30 percent time tested. infected patients wore mask, blocked nearly 100 percent viral droplets aerosol particles.

‚ÄúIf look results together, found masks able stop virus-laden respiratory droplets virus-laden aerosols,‚Äù said Ben Cowling, School Public Health University Hong Kong, study‚Äôs senior author.

How mask could protect you

While know even simple mask pretty good job protecting world outgoing germs, experts say variation much homemade masks might protect incoming germs, depending fit quality material used.

But thing is, don‚Äôt need super-efficient mask you‚Äôre practicing social distancing washing hands. use fabric decent filtration potential ‚Äî like two layers heavy cotton flannel ‚Äî wear mask properly, increase chances avoiding virus.

The bottom line practice social distancing, wash hands wear mask times must leave house, lowering risk getting sick.

Your mask makes everyone else‚Äôs mask look normal

In parts Asia, communities dealt serious contagions like SARS MERS, wearing mask isn‚Äôt considered weird. fact, it‚Äôs expected. everyone wears mask, accepted mask wearing become.

‚ÄúIf everybody wear mask, there‚Äôs stigma,‚Äù said Soe-Lin, lecturer Yale Jackson Institute Global Affairs. ‚ÄúI would like see change social norms. Hong Kong, it‚Äôs good thing see someone mask. you‚Äôre sick, put mask on. You‚Äôre kind rude coughing without mask on.

The Dos Don‚Äôts Masks

To get mask, make sure wear correctly right time.

How put mask take one off

Always wash hands first. Don‚Äôt touch fabric part mask ‚Äî that‚Äôs essentially germ filter, don‚Äôt want spread whatever germs trapped. Use ear loops ties secure mask remove it. coverage area go near bridge nose chin stretch halfway toward ears. Pull ties loops fits snugly possible face. mask pleats, folded side down.

Don‚Äôt try cheat mask

The writer Peter Hessler, recently wrote life lockdown China New Yorker, created names various ways people take breaks masks wearing way explain right wrong ways wear mask daughters. ‚Äúholster‚Äù mask pulled resting neck. ‚Äúflap jack‚Äù happens person takes one ear loop talk phone. there‚Äôs ‚Äúlow rider.‚Äù ‚ÄúThis pretend obeying rules, actually tug mask nostrils uncovered,‚Äù said. make mask far less effective protecting germs.

To learn more, read guide Wear Mask.

The risk wearing mask

In theory, fidgeting mask could introduce germs face, you‚Äôre touching face much, greatly increasing risk getting sick anyway.

But real worry wearing mask start believe it‚Äôs protecting really is. Behavioral economists know people begin feel safe, take risks. It‚Äôs phenomenon seen federal regulations first made cars safer added features like seatbelts, people responded driving recklessly. doctors wear decontamination gowns, studies show may become lax safety protocols. communities Mexico began outdoor mosquito spraying combat dengue fever, families less likely adopt personal prevention practices.

Masks make us feel safer, benefit wearing mask quickly negated lose resolve social distancing hand washing. Don‚Äôt start lingering grocery stores spending time friends wearing mask. mask alone protect coronavirus.

Do need wear mask outdoors?

The recommendation wear mask times public spaces don‚Äôt know virus doesn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs also socially responsible wear mask, even you‚Äôre outside.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs signal well actual risk,‚Äù said Dr. Siddhartha Mukherjee, assistant professor medicine Columbia University. ‚ÄúIf we‚Äôre going deploy this, would urge people stay side caution send social message don‚Äôt know it, one particular exception rule. universally possible.‚Äù

Do need wear mask outdoor exercise?

In general, outdoor exercise, without mask, seems safe, according experts. Researchers cautioned little known heavy breathing aerobic exercise affects viral spread. Phys Ed columnist Gretchen Reynolds suggestions cautions Exercising Outdoors Face Mask.

There ideal staffing ratios, hospitals going release current staffing ratios. 

Hospitals normally understaffed(due cost-cutting pre-pandemic nursing shortage). would horrified nurse patient ratios. likely surges ICU going understaffed, supplementing staff (un)qualified personal(ie-non ICU nurses).

Also, risk accidents caused medical personal goes longer shift work. Residents limited certain number hours. Nurses - legal limits! Agreed, sure got downvoted either. 

Some people want get vaccine immediately, others want wait little longer see larger population. 

Those essential workers, daycare etc might want first, immuno-compromised wait out, might want to.

Personally, use saying lived Florida would directly avoid interaction puts contact 16 (=1/0.06) people odds would tilt towards one infected point would depending social distancing/masks/hygene rather rarity disease protection. Air bnb, vacation homes, hotel rooms happening globally including places like Canada. specific UK, US profit system continues treat money. Germany delayed surgery treatment too. hoax every country planet? Manufactured make one US President look bad?

What strange world live in. Many Americans cannot even afford getting tested first place. disgrace. One friends caught covid equally careful. People say left home chat neighbors such. Grocery pickup 100% safe either, last pickup guy lowered mask opened back seat door put stuff in. Lots people, asked, say stayed home despite pickup cause ""count"" going out. Shit happens. gonna posted that. Yes, people need take good care fat main reason may suffer long term complication young age. Yeah, sure think COVID-19 type hoax. mom nursing prof, insisted learn early ""an MD evidence persistence. genius, even talent. Persistence. many lousy doctors lousy plumbers electricians."" Houston confirmed cases protests. think likely officials condoning protests size scope signaled many pandemic control measures longer necessary could wanted. led parties, packing bars, etc, spread round infections. hope california gonna provide 100 percent wages, isnt, fuck right federal state governments. ya fucking douchelickers  This, oh god, much this. policy place since Clinton office... Online classes literally never qualification student visa, physical presence USA required take online class. *Escape New York* (1997), *Escape LA* (2013), comes *Escape USA* (2021)!

A power-mad president taken hostage entire country. Wearing masks illegal guns free all. [Snake escape place workers sick people rights?

This movie rated yet. Go bed hick would kill could fix something way cause harm everyone Land free, home sick. Pretty much. he's polite say like that. wouldn‚Äôt compare Germany Britain, good grasp covid start, allowing react like to, cases I‚Äôm sure wouldn‚Äôt either. still completely missed point they're saying. demand shipping masks, puts much heavier stressful workload workers there's stuff package. meant package handlers getting sick possibly quitting. wish did. There's stories paitents HOSPITALIZED Covid screaming doctors that's Covid hoax centralized lot money power early on. testament value belief. kills less flu /s cancel YMCA membership otherwise would keep charging since they've open [wHy dEaThS gOiNg Let die. Like, post conspiracy shit perpetuate misinformation, treatment you, die stop contributing problem. That's said first time im bout fun thing tho. confirm. back December too. coughing choking. Horrible. shit back December. Holy shit - going r/Conservative subreddit like going alternate universe. Like, **that‚Äôs** you‚Äôre concerned everything else overshadows that????? Wtf

What bunch delusional loons  see logic, weren‚Äôt taught government people, people people?
The president supposed one charge running government, government, are. 
That‚Äôs recall told whole life. Authoritarians everywhere immediately took health crisis chance tighten rule every aspect human life death. mentioned, country unfortunately particularly strong ties CCP government work tandem Tongs order allow buy masks claiming nobody needed them. 

It definitely matter corporate interests trying ignore little death, death, death, death order earn huge fortune cash cash cash cash cash cash cash cash cash cash cash cash cash cash cash cash cash. luckily, people smarter making decision smart enough. wonder many hurricanes would kill people refused listen scientists...""not going take shelter give muh freedumbs"" getting picture taken hospital messing privacy? That's they'd stop friend...what waiting for? hospitals privatized. filming inside intellectual property. want anything inside released, guess what, hospitals make money.

Not really. AFAIK legal USA film hospital publish video. might asked leave course, footage would either way. architect successful strategy state epidemiologist, yes. It‚Äôs hard guess.

If divide today‚Äôs deaths cases three weeks ago, estimate CFR. Plot that, you‚Äôll see it‚Äôs 2% dropping. 

Assuming stays 2%, you‚Äôd get 140 deaths per day three weeks now. Deaths 70/day now, expect climb somewhere 140 July. Love hahahaha deaths don‚Äôt include anyone care about, won‚Äôt change. 99% population could die people wouldn‚Äôt give shit didn‚Äôt affect personally (somehow). agree Trump moron many members base. even read article? isn‚Äôt exactly Trump‚Äôs base referencing here. wondered months ago original hydroxy-chloroquine stuff came out. Since it‚Äôs drug family quinine knew quinine originally anti-malarial/preventative therapy (before used flavor tonic) thought might work Covid-19 preventative treatment. Clickbaiting fearmongering? r/Coronavirus ?? Never think part produce x amount hours live tv week, lose deals, similar AEW similar situation shutting down, handled virus much better WWE. WWE mandated masks now, issuing fines non compliance, testing regularly. don‚Äôt believe wrestling kind fan base like nfl nba wether prolonged shutdown financially.  Italy now? Better quarantimes hope scientific criteria ""stabilized"" mean? Common understand term ""stabilize"" mean numbers growing. Florida consistently 10,000 cases day, also stabilized, exactly good news it? think commenter making horrible point, impossible reinfected year like we'd see reinfections yet even millions it. year yet. study. new study? No. Therefore article date. Wait hear many people currently losing homes, vehicles businesses virus..

Gonna blow mind. So.. testing. 6 months cases weird unexplainable reason 1/3rd Americans recently died healthcare system ecconomy mysteriously collapsed. hey... covid cases good. LPN vs. RN. RNs go college. hospital, generally good. LPNs feed, bathe, monitor vital signs, etc. know much. Florida governor Florida Man. things started slowing down, saw lot people saying things like ""Lockdown done protect health care system give time prepare. part flattened curve, let us go back work."" reason people thought flattening curve one time thing, though high numbers April come small ones before.

Poor communication information (and lot misinformation) actually lot what's destroying us this. vitriol. understand it, too. Many Americans left behind education system. Some, like Appalachia, looked upon generations land stolen raped coal corps. people people failed nation, purpose, take them. critical thinking skills understanding science. Twitler rose power, bc people know like called stupid time.

""Hillbilly"" excellent documentary explores this. allowed look people long. dividing nation, purposeful. eager meet god? Umm... what? Violence far censored EU versus USA. Sex reverse. Oh that's good hear cough! one kicked ass lasted month. easily say worst cough I've ever life. spent like month bed curtains closed, running vaporizer lathered Vicks. 

I think nailed hard spent last half February types flu immune system chance build back up. picked one up, one right other, doctors office. really irks would've never even doctors office damn doctors notes needed.

Here's something scary chew too. took antibody test last week antibodies anymore. Unless test accurate. pleased that. antibodies disappear people fast going complete total crapshow. America long-standing history racism towards Asians. problem outlined headline - society views Asian racism stereotypes comedy never taken seriously. Yes, is. user content posted. 'spamming' posting links comments disagree with. justification attacking motivations speculating post do. think genuine user report Admins proof. Ohio enters Florida 30 day stay state funded rehabilitation center never leaves. call 3rd hand information supposedly fire chief real proof confirmation. I‚Äôll take incremental improvements ACA whatever whatever nightmare ruby overlords planned us get another 4 years, thank-you much. ‚Äúboth sides‚Äù hogwash getting tiresome. Personally, think they‚Äôre hiding numbers. still sure sense taste/smell. part, would described senses diminished... changed. first 3 days starting fever day, everything tasted disgusting. Like, tried drink protein drink hard eat, tasted like made spoiled milk. Everything ate like that. Everything gross.

But one thing caused question sense taste. take medication usually find abhorrent. Putting mouth long enough swallow often makes gag, causing involuntary shake head minute like trying drink high proof liquor undiluted. period, could actually hold mouth prolonged periods effect. could tell taste good, lacked overpowering revulsion used to. lasted week, apart that, could definitively say whether senses smell taste lessened. certainly eliminated.

Anyway, thank response. agree experience sounds familiar. said, know able convince get tested symptom free week apart diarrhea. maybe should. work wants come cover boss's vacation week next. vast majority colos done people 50+, also family history concerning symptoms without explanations (eg. investigate inflammatory bowel disease blood stool without obvious hemorrhoids) impact virus varying much affects people? example, seen different cases COVID-19 devastating impacts portions population whether young, old people underlying health conditions. contrary, cases younger older folks getting minor symptoms symptoms¬†at all. exactly play here, multiple strains¬†of virus many factors contributing diversity impact virus people? Problem kinds people refuse wear masks absolute *last* people would want around critically ill patients. would cough people ventilators supplies. I'm joking say that. People suffering funny them. They'd love every minute it. Right, still requires someone respond ""party"" emergency capacity. I'm seeing anything fire chief got information, ""confirmed"" it. r/Ihavesex use abusive term ""spam"" really collection sources one reinvent wheel every time tired, false arguments trotted out. correct link: fall rabbit hole. say every nurse, etc etc flat wrong. common areas closed became jail. Maybe, though I've read really need 60% adoption work intended country anywhere close that.

  Im lucky work home...Im worried teachers. stay home stay healthy...then it. Online classes never qualified anyone student visa (In US, EU, anywhere really), taking online courses require presence country.

The US never allowed persons taking online classes retain student visa. So, comparing two countries would say need look 3 numbers.

1) Cumulative cases per capita - did. USA 3x number cumulative cases per captia. 

2) Death per captica - USA 1.5x deaths per captia, slightly better cumulative cases per captia, still worse overall

3) Daily cases per captia - USA STRUGGLING MAY explain difference death (as daily cases curve downwards, deaths mostly catch cases, increases, deaths ""waiting wings""). Currently USA shocking 17x Canada daily cases per capita (Canada averaging around 300, USA averaging around 50,000). think testing capacity, since Canada currently averaging 0.8% positive tests, USA believe 7.5% average (and going up). eat live doesn‚Äôt affect people (much). 

If coronavirus can‚Äôt afford get tested (and also maybe can‚Äôt afford take time work), I‚Äôm going take lot people me. Let show article found peaks estimated. states passed already, aren‚Äôt December. 

Check out: think? What? US death toll per captia 7th highest world, rising rapidly. mean, percentages normal mask much unless infected person wearing it. Obviously parties wearing still best. family sat around drinking playing board games together, like sad kind drinking together. numb, celebrate. 

Still drove cabin though (I know, big bad get dodge bit. go town all). good unplug online days! Texas, specifically hotspot San Antonio (who hospital beds sending patients areas), began stop testing anyone without symptoms. fuck people still think hoax??? think states spent time lockdown trying figure get lockdown ASAP Yea Donnie saying ‚Äúmy authority total‚Äù didn‚Äôt make think government overreach. politics Teaching person, especially entire race, victims going bad effects.

Most people US agree racism exists, black people still suffering effects centuries systemic racism, cyclic poverty war drugs destroying communities.

However, people hold every negative statistic black people caused racism. say racism, black peoples choices culture play part get pissed. act like black people hold responsibility lives turn out, statistics show blacks succesful racism. outliers successful blacks matter.

This horrible mindest give people, affecting black culture negative way. can't tell people responsible life turned out. failed racism, successful lucky. I'll give example.

People problem saying asians successful culture, ""Tiger mom"" thing people wanted emulate Asian culture importance education. say inner city black culture part problem considered racist.

I know argued part culture came systemic racism, lot coming current movement itself. BLM Barack Obama even said blacks need stop denigrating blacks getting education.

Also, can't 70% black kids raised without father, expect negatively affect statistics blacks successful. strong family unit another reason Asians successful. studies show father figure extremely bad young men.

Everyone agrees Asians successful strong family unit intense focus education child rearing. mention statistics show black people severly lack strong family unit, stigma wanted educated acting white, racist. insane people can't link points together without called racist.

I know people say black kids father systemic racism put prison. again, that's blaming racism every bad statistic concerning black community. Racism exists, completely exonerate black people free make smart life decisions. happily cut life isolate echo chamber beliefs. attitude driving divide US right now.

I know hopeless feels. grandparents went path passed. However, believe personal connection anecdotes circle people real hope changing minds. one challenge media consumption, brain washing radical beliefs, continue path rest lives happily.

Also, Google ""shame motivator"" read one two top results. Shame believed effective making change among psychology community feels GOOD dish feel better yourself. No, directly injecting antibodies patients done hospitalized severe cases. vaccine expose body (part) virus rendered harmless incite immune system respond making antibodies. key body learns produce antibodies itself, goal achieved injecting antibodies someone else. Mickey make say that? described ""Covid Party."" That's biped thing. quadruped's neck well defended, get past head hit neck. Anything big enough require hitting neck quick kill kind primary defense like horns, hooves, teeth make going neck blow dangerous. armoring neck would limit mobility primary defensive weapon, rhino can't swing neck viciously can't bring horn bear lion hyena close combat, horn becomes useful charge.

Even bipeds defend necks pretty good. Look boxers MMA fighters stand, tuck chins protect necks. Hey y‚Äôall, may dumb question don‚Äôt know ask google way yields results I‚Äôm looking for. (I tried). say hospitals hitting full capacity , count people come say ‚ÄúI corona‚Äù told go home hospital patients? want us lose morale fight amongst other. literally propaganda tactic.  Dude whole sub like ‚Äúha! Look this, Covid didn‚Äôt come China, CCP good America bad!!!!!!‚Äù saw headline, even though false positive FAR likely. didn‚Äôt like possibility doesn‚Äôt fit sub‚Äôs ‚ÄúAmerica worst earth‚Äù narrative alternative healthcare workers would even less access masks? 1 mask allows 1 healthcare worker save X people, strategy makes sense. unfortunate required misleading statements, alternative would even Americans dying. Keep safe try find job teaching online. Many parents know homeschooling distance learning year need there! avoiding questions.
You care people kicking consequences actions. 
Why want international students country? classes online, enough? 
Also seriously fucking telling survive budget $0? even need break law throw system, call 'wellness check'.  California also large state everything rural mountain towns big cities. one size fits solution idiotic, especially local bar restaurant may one places people meet catch up. makes sense restaurants close big city, would near capacity large portion day. restaurant small town middle nowhere gets busy Friday/Saturday nights? Probably need force close dining room service, abide reduced operating capacity Maskhole, like that, start using word too. Mexicans shiftless lazy time stealing jobs?

How come Jews weak, pathetic losers also control world run media/banks?

Bigotry, racism, stupidity like hang together parties. think politicians hired really great PR firms tell voters, ""I actually care care about. everyone else blocking me.""

But actually care. Yep, saw one. mean, sure, theory possible get herd immunity immunity granted durable sterilizing (but know yet), even context would require lot dead people. *Unless* treatments progress get insanely lucky virus becomes less deadly (not likely, theory possible). 

Still, considering ""if""s crazy go herd immunity. older article make sense try still relevant think: Yeah receiving PUA. Streaming? Nope. know people have, pales comparison 5-6 day/week steady gig. I‚Äôve recording sessions bit writing past 4 months, much else. think it‚Äôs time look career change.  people agencies would involved conspiracy keep secret, less likely it‚Äôs conspiracy. What? sustained exponential growth good economy bad pandemic? consistency. Paywall rates make look comical.

Sweden considered response poor, they're investigating want bad news - live NYC, lost neighbors this. Healthy, younger middle aged neighbors left behind families, 90 year old COPD. want action.

New York took action tamed this. rest country could same, we're busy pretending impossible (despite fact rest industrialized world figured out) somehow, trying take steps mitigate hurt economy (as virus raging good enough job already).

I want federal government dislodge head ass actually try solve problem instead pretending going 'magically go away'. Save thoughts prayers something else. think 31% bit larger average. case?

No idea.  article provide evidence previous years provide context. currently Florida far Sarasota.... know temperature here. seriously arguing temperature state someone physically right now. going correct one sorry....

Edit: Also, weather prediction based averages facts (that's wrong 50% time). That's call average high day. .3% brightest productive citizens country. think US forefront science tech, pool best talent across world universities. 

International students also pay ton money college bringing hundreds millions dollars us economy. 'Model Minority' myth gets little obnoxious while, since [bamboo ceiling Asian American average higher education levels, inequality simple comparison. [Vast majority Asian adults foreign born heavily skews education might even say leads Simpson's paradox combine Asian ethnic groups. South, East Southeast Asians same. wasn‚Äôt perfect think actually good enough trajectory end April, problem many states reopened things weeks early, sped phases quickly. also don‚Äôt good enough tracing programs place handle surges, although could mitigated bit slowing reopening. I‚Äôm surprised nobody noticed racism comment is. racism Chinese totally OK, end day? posted says ‚Äúfurther follow-up required‚Äù. replace may may means thing. I‚Äôm saying irreversible, I‚Äôm commenting anything conclusive yet, despite making original comment OFTEN irreversible. 80% Latinos face racist slurs form racial microagression daily. easy prioritise dead, Vietnam found one.

Because took disease seriously. [Inform understand state testing country. Saying I‚Äôm incredibly pissed would understatement. That's LexFloruss said would ok normal circumstances. would happen university switches full online October (very likely!)? would leave, hope overpriced flights home country get deported. need attention get served... Except could say everyone else population. run clinical tests all?

If risks outweigh benefits population, politicians - better access screening testing - last ones given potentially unsafe vaccine. they've charged? lose jobs get sent prison justice system even corrupted, failure! Funny government (Donnie) saying ‚Äúmy authority total‚Äù doesn‚Äôt make ask government authoritative. But, asking put mask makes question losing freedoms. I'm 40 FWIW. I'm saying problems. I'm saying taught entire life growing matter problems. That's life. Life's fair. Suck move on. That's I've always told taught that's life I've seen family members live. 30 percent believe lies... Economic academic failure? Still want feel superior people? Try conspiracy theories! Well vague enough meaningless lmao deserved  Sorry bad experiences here, too. sounds like awesome work. sub mixed bag.

Twitter hellhole though. see comments retweets like worst Facebook meets worst reddit. People completely insane packed bots. can't believe clean place comparison. You‚Äôre riot probably Asian countries pretty racist people. Maybe that's see something that's natural. worst still way ...... also lack personal responsibility, sense civic duty, appreciation scientific fact, recognition existence objective truth, basic common sense. Well 1900 (due limited tech miscommunication) cat 4(roughly) wiped ~8,000 people Galveston......so lot.

Science trying help kind wish people would give time day. X Bullshit fabric surgical mask expensive hard get. make one old shirt. Cover rat holes stop making weak excuses. Minimum wage 20 bucks hour Australia. You‚Äôre telling Vietnamese people afford access wear masks Australians can‚Äôt? Please. 

Asymptomatic transmission (plus human optimism ‚ÄúI‚Äôm probably sick I‚Äôm Probably tired/hungover/dehydrated) means masks everyone required actually knock transmission. Saying masks sick people turns mask wearing scarlet letter sorts, means policy functionally DISCOURAGES mask wearing negative respons eothers (‚Äúew she‚Äôs sick fuck among people?‚Äù)

Besides, masks offer protection wearer (tho effective protecting others wearer). would want line painful lesson masks America currently getting? understand need use logic use working lazy immigrants want work steal jobs...

It requires mental gymnastics much higher level obtain. know I've liberal use Block feature social medias. made life better place.

Everything done eradicate VIRUS LMAO! **'The world looking us leader...' incompetence.** Lol ... idiot... deep state opposite democratic... trump exhibited wish ‚Äúdictatorship‚Äù ... stop propaganda... easier attitude whole system you. Black people want get fair shake people get. work twice hard get zero actually. built country slaves, got free 200 years tried get gains, tried vote, land racist whites gains making, rewrite whole system sudden vote, made segregation law land small modest gains gotten suddenly got reversed. struggled built towns like black wallstreet Tulsa Oklahoma hundreds wealthy people killed wealth destroyed racist whites. 1 town number them.

Then lynching parties 1 accusations u looked white woman funny would get killed like Emmett Till. 14 tear old boy got electrocuted sitting bible state false accusation murdered 2 white girls. name cleared several decades.

Black people also fought WW1 &amp; WW2 excluded GI Bill New Deal helped white people get middle class now. loans available also experience redlining? u work hard move good neighborhood sudden, there's white flight white people move out? can't tell many articles read talk banks would refuse loan even decided loan fraction, get worst loans.

And enough prosperous black towns get razed people killed, black neighborhoods get destroyed inorder build highways like e.g. Chatlott's I-277. city this. Public schools defunded. Black people suffering crack epidemic facilitated Reagan Iran-contra scandal treated criminals white people suffering opioid addiction, suddenly health crisis instead going jail, need need help. ab unequal justice system treats black people way harsher white people. bag weed send black person signifact jail time white person get probation. even mention police treat black white people differently whether respectful not.

Or even media treat people example Katrina. White people taking supplies seen taking need survive black people looters. Black people pleading lives matter asking special treatment, asking granted rights treated white person Asian person. Get opportunities races get. Yes races may difficulties hard black people every facet life. Even simple thing going doctor sick pain significant challenge medical professionals ready dismiss pain think black people feel pain. mention disgusting Tuskegee experiment! economic equality fix issue rich AF black people like Serena Williams can't get Medical professionals realize something seriously wrong gave birth hospital. rich AF stopped people like Chris Rock stopped police FG driving Black.

My mom says Chinese using coronavirus install 5G towers take world, caused virus need pay, cases overrated story broke someone car crash counted corona.

Also media said dad said deaths would end 60K deaths back months ago. now? remember co-workers showing conspiracy theory videos back 2012 (that actually believed second) UN coming take everyone‚Äôs guns &amp; imprison us abandoned shopping malls. gun nuts. Nice guys, crazy guns. one way wrap brain around consider many strains covid are. i'm sure answer presumably one since people clearly asymptomatic, clearly minor symptoms, deathly ill.

another way looking even among ""healthy"" people, stress play part illness, work/sleep schedule, well eat, vitamins have, medicines take take. two people healthy mean clones.

given US population kind preexisting condition, hard find data disease impacts don't. healthy people still occasionally die myriad tragic illnesses even math shouldn't.

There's way event organized Russia. change mind. admitted knew back masks work lied attempt save mask supply hospitals. Yeah you‚Äôd think repeatedly fu**ed politicians years, maybe people would cotton on? Hard times build tough people.

My take I'm software developer need office except sake ""watched"" others. want emotional security knowing office workers work, little that. people work essential workers physically interact machinery conduct tasks. job everyone else stay workplace protect workers. get much outdoor time prison, generally.

The internet developed United States internet behemoths like Google Amazon based here. It‚Äôs overwhelmingly likely average non-American westerner uses relies services owned companies.
2.	Non-Americans reading using American social media right now. People use social media largely reliant American platforms.
3.	The US dollar influential currency world, that‚Äôs whenever downturn spreads causes recession countries too. example, Great Recession hit EU harder hit us even though started here.

I don‚Äôt even think USA needs #1, personally. think idea USA somehow going become irrelevant global economy lifetimes absurd. It‚Äôs obvious we‚Äôre going continue major player many decades come, although doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean exact role stay exactly same.  HIV never resulted restriction movement though. currently saying ""if test positive contacted tracer exposure summarily sentenced indefinite house arrest"". must comply threat arrest, far tell actual laws allowing this, done governor decree. COVID going tear country pieces take education approach rather forced compliance approach. hoaxes powerful, actually infect real virus. greatest lie americans still, somehow, believe healthcare system best. maybe rich fuck afford best doctors skip line flaunting cash, yeah, sure, majority americans we're fucked.

I wanted provide perspective. shouldn‚Äôt full lockdown. It‚Äôs already causing deaths related covid missed cancer screenings overdose deaths. things going complete shit (I know, know, also surprised things follow path rainbows Abbott Patrick laid out. Shockingly, scientific projections way accurate.) forcing early reopening Texas economy overriding local mandates, like mask requirements, Abbott playing damn blame game again, calling local government current state affairs.Patrick

He's weaselly little punk. Reminds fully one kid went school always excuse schoolwork done. grows co-worker never learned self responsibility blames everyone else shortcomings. point finally cut whiney, excuse-laden word spew production progress meeting boss, tell everything that's wrong him.

Yeah, someone needs say Abbott. Anger management, workplace bullying classes, writing apology lessen satisfaction.  tragic. happen, people govern told multiple people step back line. seem get angry starts spiking people dont care get rough Culver City. Masks fine, reading sub seems like cult saying masks useful tool shed. That's really true.

The problem US, see afar, never proper lockdown except states New England (which well now). country (Denmark) badly hit March, beat virus lockdown social distancing, followed highest number tests outside Gulf contact tracking. 

Mask usage public spaces never 1 % encouraged authorities. Football stadiums reached 8,000 capacities. Even though still virus around, seen anyone mask 3-4 weeks. missing pastor wife tested positive they're going church Sunday? actual fuck? Someone shut fucker down. really think unrealistic honest. locked ten days late keep cases low, still went Mid March till two days ago! feel like average American simply doesn‚Äôt listen. don‚Äôt think leadership entirely fault here, peoples mindset thats issue Honestly, I'm trying hardest find kind way convey seriousness. I'm good it, I'm trying, something do.

It sucks words rubbed likely plenty others wrong way.

I think alarmist dramatic enough right assuming shaped towards action help current situation. India possibly worse spot US they're essentially flying blind. I'd interested see India excess deaths general attributed flu pneumonia strokes. nothing counties following guidelines not, corresponds population. 

Consider this. asymptomatic COVID positive person travels San Jose Napa wine taste Fourth July. visit number wineries, start feeling sick. go Napa hospital test positive. Here‚Äôs kicker, ledger counts Santa Clara County +1 positive case, Napa County none (yet.) It‚Äôs Napa County safe, it‚Äôs numbers haven‚Äôt caught yet.

Everyone saying maniac . Ego Newson I'd expect day-to-day data entry corrections skew much (things like results entered twice, results entered late, found later mistakes whatever reason - real time data messy). 

It would better X days last symptoms, would that? There's centralized medical record system US, trust places testing labs report correctly system. Testing people symptoms medical justification, forcing get tested slightly better statistics waste resources. haven‚Äôt able leave. (Unsure now) school lot actually stayed got sent home March due travel limitations. insane come this. Florida resident, baffled current leaders. Even county commissioner damn rocker spouting jobs economy lives.

Thankfully, local parenting groups area coming together start homeschooling groups grade levels parents keep kids families safe. 

It's pretty heartbreaking see posts kids telling internet strangers they're scared go school want get families sick. feel like they're gonna forced government said schools going open little changes anyone's safety. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

I can't even imagine stressed essential workers teachers must feel right now. right. Please kiss touch many loved ones me. less ignorant, better rest us be. 

May odds favor honey. CDC CMS done more? Absolutely. absolving blame. time, comes NY specifically, governor refused accept responsibility EO signature it.

Over 100 press conferences he's never explained nursing homes prohibited testing patients prior admission/readmission (which 180 CMS). journalists ask, accuses ""political"". yet, agency's new report nursing homes claims recovering patients contagious.

Speaking report, Cuomo's agency clearing blame laughable, especially anyone lives NY seen downright Trumpian way Cuomo exerts control (see: Moreland Commission, Train Daddy, etc.) like every single person ignoring NY's pattern. What, people gonna die get infected?????

This whole ""they died lot yet days"" real smooth-brained action. separated cases

However, I‚Äôll drop class 2020. Keep mind self reporting survey students well probably likely report. It‚Äôs still egregiously high: percent respondents reported GPA 3.7 higher. A- 3.6, according Harvard‚Äôs grading scale.‚Äù

The article nothing advertisement.  know people allowed throw tantrums public children punnishments. child wouldnt able sit comfortably week Remmeber hit 10M cases honestly think reason Colorado well due altitude. I've read nothing one way another, please mistake hypothesis fact, goes:
 
We know sunlight kills covid much quicker dies without 
Colorado mile up, less atmosphere Earth sun, sunlight gets through. 
 
Even though people cautious mask wearers (I see hundreds day apartment wear them) go high country regularly, people two nearly three times higher already high elevation Denver. 
 
Plus there's whole theory lungs adapted high altitudes better equipped resist covid.
 
And look Tibet high altitude countries, rates rather low.
 
So think long huddling ski lodge (indoors) tons strangers, pretty safe Colorado.
 
Or least hope continue be. almost narcissistic sociopath President bad idea.

Owen hart died live television scary tragic way possible

Right ring infront sold crowd.

It hour 3 hour show

They carried finished PPV died ambulance.



WWE shuts nothing Honestly, already trust government science. already gone. way save lives making everyone wear mask, even kicking screaming. nearly enough people wearing masks. Well US going herd immunity (Swedish) route actually, nobody administration willing say it. According TMC, almost half ICU patients covid patients. insane number. proper clothing still able bike winters. already U.S. programs planning attend colleges universities offer online classes fall need transfer schools providing in-person instruction, depart country face potential deportation, ICE said.¬†

Evil. federal government punishing immigrants federal government's fuck up. sure basing on. Cya Lol dream world live in? guess hellish weekend hospital mostly full sick people illusion. We‚Äôre busier we‚Äôve year. 15% positive test, maybe 10% population decides need get tested went around exposed people (this complete guess), let's say another 10% get tested reason decided (again complete guess).... would put 3% current infection rate.

Add people previously, maybe 2% population, 5%. 

While hand NYC may 15%. 

So Florida close stuff fast, they'll see rates increase consistently. 

Overall, knows. 5% bad guess. Probably somewhere 3% 10% correct. us terrible accumulating karma. Im generally great getting karma, lose whatever gain arguing /r/conservative. get accused troll elsewhere even commenting sub lol. Hey guys,

I developed Android app input text make really big smartphone screen. thought would apply everyone wants communicate people keeping social distancing active.

You're obviously giving shit take someone's last breath waste mine you.

I'm done here. Good luck. fed either fashion mass evictions pandemic hands. ain‚Äôt alternatives board point, it‚Äôs time $20 million, anything deemed essential. least that's going rate I'm getting pay play Florida. people wearing blinders?

ftp, let em rot hell That‚Äôs bc people gym following orders wearing mask gloves staying 6 feet apart times. Even working out. Yes it‚Äôs sucks rather keep gyms open.

I could care less bars restaurants ""stabilize"" 2 months ago decided start reopening? Well partially fault. lead example trumpeters governors (until recently) listen. need leader it. WriteScottWrite win internet That's ridiculous, what? Maybe reflexive could buy. even conscious it? I'm gonna need see evidence one. Careful. They‚Äôll go lol fucking losers around True. great Australia beginning pandemic might real issue now. virus spreading like wild fire countries shut didn‚Äôt many cases. many countries opening receptive virus. \*both political parties brother caught complained symptoms. Fatigue, aches, malaise loss smell taste. However, said he‚Äôs worse.... contracted novel strain of
N1H1 deployed Afghanistan many years ago, yeah probably worse. Still, staying indoors vaccine available. Half deaths properly counted though.

If look overall average deaths per month compare last year see way clearer picture. real numbers States almost double. Ask Dan ""The Reaper"" Patrick many ""greater fatalities"" gave life willingly state economy? Alabama seems following suit counties deal rather granny governor anything useful. recently started battle lung cancer even wear mask herself. That's leading us.  Realistically, hospitals raise ratios high workers willing accept them. point nurses hopefully push back refuse unsafe assignments, threshold pretty high people. shoot! read Austria live Victoria, Melbourne specifically. amount people going rules, wearing masks etc staggering. deserve tbh Based username, [you've probably already seen accurate Man, USA pathetically behind figured out. feel like knew months ago. hate much? federal government didn‚Äôt enough help states (and local governments, businesses people within states) cope financial consequences complying CDC guidelines. Certain senators made clear fiscal help coming state local governments, additional bailouts coming people CARES act. had, think you‚Äôd see lot states following closer safe science based reopenings we‚Äôre seeing around world.  right take Fifth then? say Trump left governors dropped ball, opened soon. think litter leadership top would helpful? Fuerza hermano del Per√∫. Saludos de Argentina, siempre les deseamos lo mejor desde ac√°. alignment facts. trying play people actually reporting happening them. could care less happening replication not. fact matter is, happening. sounds like another ""don't worry"" spin attempt. Invest food truck. would require said leader giving power. universities worked at, classrooms full basically time. class 70 students enrolled, put room big. empty 150 seat classrooms sitting around could switch class to. suspect there's going lot ""Well, make do. wash hands often."" Meanwhile troll Twitter tell basically 132k deaths U,S. exist hospitals used Covid cause death make money. Living college town: yes, we're worried. Faculty worried (hence article) - older preexisting conditions, family members worried, people staff college bars etc. concerned, precisely reason. I'll hate see case count look like week move-in weekend. honestly think Americans stupidest fucking people earth. hell many countries take seriously, bunch individualistic assholes think funny wear mask direct anger failures executive office May rest peace wherever religion leads him. amazing Puerto Rico could biggest crisis presidency? mean, aside trying blackmail Ukraine getting impeached, trying get Justice department drop cases cronies, etc, etc, -ok tons things. hurricane could natural disasters crisis presidency, he'd able say ""look good did. bad storm, worst thing happened. Llook much economy grew"" (entirely outside incompetent hands).

And Coronavirus came, mess politician world except Bolsanaro. Imagine handled competently Korea did. US would almost completely spared it. biggest lie someone tell child one-of-a-kind special. anything believe themselves.

I‚Äôm saying realist kids day one, btw. I‚Äôm saying feeding growing person continual line unbelievably special universe healthy mindset encourage. either lead narcissism intense self-hatred. Teach people love themselves, people around them, make opportunities come way. That‚Äôs sometimes. fair, happening lesser degrees almost everywhere. Americans seem particularly ... loud stubborn all. CCP really involved, Wuhan coronavirus would even become pandemic. Floridians lost minds. They‚Äôre snorting fat rails pure coronavirus coffee tables now.  immunity may may last real length time. Wouldn‚Äôt China copy Oxfords vaccine make themselves? assume wouldn‚Äôt care following UK laws medicines. America manufacturing it, countries. Yes. lot selfish people risk group want miss good party. been? way beyond gutter new subterranean territory. nothing Trump. Especially now. People fucking idiots cannot blame Trump stupid. I.just cant wait test results start rolling another 2 weeks 4th holiday activities....its gonna epic. Facts; I'll first person call CCP bullshit, let's real here; china handled pandemic better country planet thus far, need take seriously. 

We take pride ""freedom"" (especially U.S.) pandemic making clear much ""freedom"" amounts freedom mutual responsibility society, therefore ""freedom"" hurt others due sheer negligence apathy. 1.7% matter small percentage think matters? response comes like concerned semantics actual people's lives.

I'm guy responding but.. question well. come someone asks data, data points low, somehow seems translate to: ""this person care human life.""?  


I lurking sub months now, there's often lot exaggerations taking place. certainly someone downplay cruelty virus, there's big difference 1.7% say, 70% say? 


Pointing fact discredit human lives lost, mean someone lose friend, lover, brother, mother. care human life, 1.7% definitely matters. 


However, trying figure reality situation, see someone would ask clarification.. statistically, clarity important. sort reminds someone kitchen fire went around relayed misfortune way led people believe entire house burnt down. Yes, kitchen fire could traumatic, important dealt with, rest house still standing. 


If statistically 1.7, 1.7, pointing mean deaths significant important. 


Why can't truth 1.7% \*and\* people died important loved someone? things true. Further, fatality rate low, mean take virus seriously take precautions protect 1.7% like beaches fl atm. people simple dont think virus get them...... seen pack pictures. common place here. Tired winning Unless testing biased age group averages still roughly regardless total numbers. would sometimes cases many really can't hide all. want admit it. That's true, California, Orange county hospitals nearing capacity, lock down. know back medical facilities declared Covid treatment centers flow. many people around taking virus seriously, go eat, wearing masks, generally treating like joke. I'm relatively young 29 decent health, know numbers game want take chance getting sick. I've got parents bit older really want take risk. I'm actually fucking scared what's coming I'm hoping god lock soon again. We've blown past 1k cases county today. Phoenix lot surrounding cities mask mandate started June 19th. almost 2 weeks new case growth starting slow down. counties central valley might well Texas. There's guys non-ironic cowboy hats rolling coal trucks. Imperial county basically part Arizona outbreak, outlier, Marin County far left come red massive outbreak San Quentin prison.

In short, CA ok, though SoCal could bit better. LA basin kinda hard deal with. walks life vastly different economics nearly block block basis. You‚Äôd think we‚Äôd seeing though. 4-5 months ago shit hitting fan multiple places. middle ground 6 months, stories seem point. 

Or maybe antibody countdown starts people 100% clear someone still sick, roughly 6 month ish window hasn‚Äôt started yet that‚Äôs aren‚Äôt seeing it. lot people get thing sick well beyond 2 weeks we‚Äôve told. Maybe start printing death certificates money. go hand-in-hand days. town went school nothing like hospital capacity they'd need. care college students assumed typical broken bones/car accidents, anything else would transported nearest large city. 

Their ICU/long term care capacity built around limited numbers elderly, plans lots young people getting sick, nearest cities outbreaks. Journal subscriptions -- thanks near-monopoly academic publishers researchers, charge thousands dollars access content professors (and universities pay salaries) created free. utter racket. also need pay librarians actually run things, help access info, put together course reserves classes, on. may see work, university can't run without them. Pretty much! ICE zero authority dictating education. mean, screw ICE first place, also this. That's sick want people die en masse prove right. going say bodies streets? least measles, breakthrough infections lower viral load reduced spread, even antibodies can‚Äôt fully protect you, least makes get less sick, less contagious. ü§û I‚Äôm considering going. 

I would go 24hr Fitness 2-3 would like 1-5 people honestly, I‚Äôd feel safe going always start cardio go lifting arrive one near ellipticals finished hour later, one would benches gym would like 0-3 people it. 

Having said that, virus hang air I‚Äôve heard makes want go.

The gym mental health recharger. miss it. currently home workouts aren‚Äôt anything hiking spots around packed. Nah let rip thru families. would suddenly care spreading among families didnt care spreading comminities. Corona known around least 10 000 years. One study - reviewed yet - says Corona could around since Neanderthals. question made mutate now. could triggered lot things.

Trying fight old virus lock-downs social distancing lead much bigger problem. nobody investigating many people affected? u/swfirsttram first early stages, nobody knew corona virus spread. Scientists studies weeks get infected 5 DAYS 2 WEEKS getting symptoms highly contagious. hell knows infected people got infected within 5 Days 2 weeks also Lunar New Year PEAK travel international flights.

Dumbcnt, use critical thinking rather spreading bullsht internet. former foreign student living US anymore I'm shocked policy. Reducing student experience face face classes wrong even grace ICE argument words. students people either bring great skills US case able hold (increasingly unlikely) ambassadors life US.

Could light reduced travel US ICE lacking work looking new mission? Good bois canceled membership that. don‚Äôt see anyone safe gym panting grunting. Everyone take vacation days time. two kinds people world.

Ones think clip answer, fucking Bingo. many dead fuck NJ now? Pfft.... Sounds like allergies. even know country lowest death rate? Second lowest? Third? Little clue: U.S. top five, top seven.

People posting here... know \*very\* little except religious---er political loyalties.

Factor northeast U.S. amongst 20 countries w/worst mortality rate. 

But go ahead...rant on. We're long ride. beginning. Yup. fauci said cases overall nationwide. Arizona OLD AF compared national averages- it‚Äôs retirement mecca along Florida Seems like outside air much spread, huge demonstration 1 person infected afterwards. Also restaurants mandatory serrations tables. don‚Äôt start making masks mandatory kinda defeats purpose lockdowns. I‚Äôve trying tell family friends weeks wear don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs necessary. 

I told won‚Äôt see till 2027 way things going ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Tell one attending it‚Äôs safe travel. risk isn‚Äôt worth it. comment aged well. Lol! terms cases, US hit April peak June 19. Death rate even started climbing.

If think rest US hit harder densely populated area country (tri state) there‚Äôs arguing logic last weekend partying, plus lack mask wearing social distancing see cases going up. slow unfortunately steady rise since Memorial Day. seems virus chugs along untill hits expodential growth boom. fallible logic, simple math. article mention center largest number, that's whole point argument. article itself, tell us anything, trying point 1,300 cases child care facilities directly mathematically impossible. child care facility 20 cases numbers let's say, means 40 facilities single case give .5 average even counted single case talking outbreaks facility. every facility 1 2 everything fine, article headline bullshit. eat rich covid eats us would rewarded 5 point drop approval rating. country deserves politicians. think suitable source blocked, make claim modmail function sidebar box, giving reasons proof allegedly poor quality. Brazil #15 deaths per million. India #101. Im San Diego. It‚Äôs really depressing infuriating local government handling it. used handle completely gave now. didn‚Äôt shut anything 4th everything packed. money play, HCQ common cheap anyone make big profit it, there's conspiracy simply power appearances, provide ample motive. Yep. People keep telling worry area cases started going again, death rate hospitalizations still slow lot mild cases! Except hospitalizatuons starting go up, like I've telling people would. OC resident, I'm unhappy. Wear damn mask Karen! turn Facebook join us real world. No, comments deleted personal attacks OP, content post. Again, targeted harassment continues, people behind banned. get another warning. Lol funny, one ever gave shit me, fuck give carp anyone else? think problem far often treat like idiocy alternative brilliance they're good vocal it. like loud right conflated somehow. 

Sorry People 1918/9 flu pandemic also public transport. People suck seems. policy, fact Eh? mean reason we're waiting get vaccine need know safe long-term? Like 14 months?  claim children usually suffer major disease, themselves.  problem is, school-age children good spreading diseases.  course, faculty staff exposed. School kids also bring diseases home school, give diseases parents relatives. Guys... anyone remember Chicken Pox parties? like that! But.. like much bigger scale.. every state once.. virus that's arguably deadly.. kids.. hey, everyone'll get either problem fixes (immunity) fixes (death) :) 100% stable. fuck wrong Florida? It‚Äôs always something new them! Need ridicule maskless wonders online website similar peopleofwalmart.com say month? new cases hovering around you? ‚ÄúDrain swamp.‚Äù bad make room himself. It‚Äôs non ideological affects them. affects you, jingoism thoughts prayers offer. targeting incivility specific user - words, harassment. disagree argument, counter one own, attack person. 

If harassment continues, banned - second warning. ""Possibly""; ""there chance"" setup safe spaces bedrooms guess. thread POLICE OFFICER live bay area it‚Äôs masks- bad fires last years many people n95‚Äôs leftovdr last fire season. place world, i‚Äôd neve want go study US. Ever. mean ""honest""?

I think best could time, given initial limits test capacity on.

I think deliberately lied people like Dr. Fauci did.

I know locked harder stricter country world, used time really get PPE testing tracing going. 

I believe Chinese data initial Wuhan outbreak contained 100% accurate, given thorough managing every case. 

If going doubt China, better least much doubt every ""success"" world, New Zealand Korea Japan. ""Elected official charge entire state deplorable lying sack shit."" fixed it. According Premier ABC recently, yes. masks give ""hot face"". that's good idea. stadium part. 

the thing could done one time house-mates. one poor TA spends 20 hours week 'teaching' get couple thousand students. students could sit 10 minutes breezy outdoor area modest safety protocols nonsense, nothing platitudes rhetoric. Didn‚Äôt cite single fact back conclusions allegations. passes science journalism modern times, pathetic. Yeah there‚Äôs huge problem employees overcompensated country. 

The fact employees might use days working excellent reason huge public health problem treat employees like crap. Uhh.. Dude. 

Those places shut law enforcement.. 

Essential businesses considered places sell food, required products. Things like medicine, household supplies like cleaning products, stuff like that.

So video game store, clothing store jewlery store, things like fall unessential.

Walmart considered essential cause sell food. need food survive. need Sephora. Room room seems like would even less demand (i know wouldnt want landlord swapping people gotta share bathroom pandemic) Wearing masks years? LOL. won't. 

I'll wear mine now. Need disappear way faster pundits pontificate. plan = herd immunity plan? Berlin, Berlin, oh yes, trying get new airport since, oh, long ago forgot started construction new airport. surprising monetarily influenced seems be. Fair enough.

But Russia, Denmark Israel considerably less population *combined* tests *each* US *(with 16 big pharmaceutical biotech companies)* still considerably less rates *each* US?

How? that? How? how? However, I‚Äôm hearing SNOW doesn‚Äôt problem it. ü•£, terribly wrong, anything a$$holes surprise anymore? Okay, avoid methanol... CVS free testing. read hand swab run least one nostrils. cramming way throat. appointment it, car start. Planning it, soon. lungs feel right. symptoms, then, act everyone. it, plan go mini vacation, since let work end it. Necessary workers can't going around potentially infecting customers coworkers. much. lot costs fixed. Unless uni willing lay high paid administrators (they aren't). They'll lay low level staff.  think saying heard evidence virus coming back patient recovered. 

Contrast cold sores. get infected, go away come back.

Given think immunity permanent, think would surprised bu someone getting infected, recovering, getting sick again. Similiar catching cold over. 

I'm medical doctor, interpretation. may wrong. Gas masks mandatory ... Knee deep?
Try ""In head"" Germany, mandatory wear masks supermarkets, pharmacies shops. 
So everybody uses sort masks places (masks, bandanas, t-shirt pulled cover mouth nose). 
In contexts (where mandatory) nobody uses them.  Nahh Oh, America. 

I live New Jersey, densely populated state union. went Ocean City beach boardwalk last week, trying best maintain social distance, quickly decided leave. Every single store boardwalk open, CROWDED. People standing lines shoulder shoulder, eating ice cream benches remotely 6 feet apart. Even beach, people setting towels blankets feet other. many swimmers bobbing around water looked like bowl idiot cereal. 

What Americans want admit completely come terms Covid, wrong terms. see annoyance going kill old people, care. leave U.S., students able continue remote instruction home countries.

So foreign students continue taking classes remotely home country return later semesters courses taught person? fatality rate fallen what... .004... story? 85% never even symptoms. 

I freaked c-19 anyone know. something happened (mutation?) virus bark-no-bite. It‚Äôs wineries themselves. It‚Äôs crush town visitors attracted open flooded tasting rooms, restaurants, dinner parties airbnbs etc. Bullshit. would definitely worse. Back days blobama stealing American freedoms militarizing police public. entire BLM shit show currently going directly caused administration led blobama Biden #1 guy. people short memories. Shutting non-essential businesses never gonna work. decided essential not? plenty businesses opened proclaimed essential far it.

What USA needed total shutdown businesses activities 2 weeks martial law declared. course, would week two notice advance get provisions prepare 2 weeks house arrest. can't FreEdOm. Florida could add 0 daily numbers get praised governor good job People ""not giving shit"" about. one denying anyone pain suffering this. inaccurate say something documented isn't. say anything want, simply anecdotal there's documentation. Must nice, meanwhile healthcare covered prove beyond reasonable doubt caught work. -_- Citizens patrol? Gotcha thanks, strange tweeted immediately talked cough days interview lol. totally agree. live high-rise downtown 30+ floors 12 units per. Probably 800+ residents. elevators plastered 'mask required' signs rarely see anyone except on. often see guys trying stare down, sad attempts egging conflict.
 
It's unbelievable central urban dense housing community scare shit everyone forced surrounded strangers air exhale. 
 
That's I've got theory altitude helping. Nothing else makes sense. Coloradoans acting like belong Houston, can't come reason numbers similar. would funny actually anything stop unmasked riders, not. Maybe already virus say anything. makes sense, really care anyone else. it‚Äôs not.

The goal flattening curve pertains hospital capacity (and number inevitable, later)

*Lockdowns* facilitated FTC, slowing spread, also create ‚Äúrestart‚Äù, buy time things necessary order open back continuing mitigate spread.

Lockdowns buy *time.* Time increase PPE, testing capacity, hospital capacity, comprehensive contact tracing, quarantine/isolation procedures, public education prepare citizens actions need take upon reopening (like importance masking).

Then, open back keep spread low controlled, buys even time research development discovery therapeutic prophylactics, antivirals, drugs/treatments, eventually vaccine.

It‚Äôs economy vs lives. Plenty countries acted late made use lockdown time, kept low rates stable continuing decline even opening back up.

Countries *wasted* lockdown seeing increases upon reopening. didn‚Äôt way.

There never inevitable number deaths. learn virus, learn treat better, transmission.

We saving people today could saved early months pandemic *we didn‚Äôt know to*, do. trend continue throughout course pandemic.

And effect even greater effective drug treatment protocol kind discovered/developed.

It better infected later, earlier, chances surviving infection go drastically. mitigate spread, lives saved. 

The last thing want ‚Äúallow spread‚Äù ‚Äúwelcome new cases‚Äù, that‚Äôs ridiculous. would arguable even CoV19 infection conferred permanent, strong immunity, it‚Äôs even worse considering still know nothing Covid immunity (though currently evidence available isn‚Äôt looking good). I‚Äôm sure new ‚ÄúWorld Clorox‚Äù flume ride (wear white) thrice-daily ‚ÄúMain Street UV-C Light Parade‚Äù make things fine. would instead year? can't travel get good job abdication responsibility. someone know, wearing normal mask, sits near one unmasked assholes gets sick, gonna think better idea would kick unmasked train. funny all. Evidence? hospitalized people usually stay quite while, people enter hospitals, it'll people begin trickle them. netherlands schools open 18yo, seems like Children adult spread less likely adult child spread. cool.

It's gut feeling (possibly completely unsubstantiated) things work ok-ish there's critical mass people ignoring safety. then, things spike. job? guess job lol. evidence that? Probably objective? it'll back! next fall hopefully normal. then, online year, used college classes professor expectations struggling balance newness college schoolwork socializing, enjoy socializing more. Really hoping acceptable practice this!

Even mild mental health day, still work, it‚Äôd easier home sometimes mental illness going extenuating circumstances. That's certainty. have/had resources well, decided would another great thing turn ""muh rights"" argument. Also help president saying virus disappear soon since changed saying hoax. stock market care government's response, people's response generally. people shut demand goods services voluntarily, businesses offering full service one's buying, that's potentially worse enforced shutdown marginal costs reduced fixed costs subsidized temporary increase government spending.

Don't get wrong - dead nonagenarians negligible effect stock prices United Airlines suddenly paying billions fly lot air around country, that's good stock price. No, that‚Äôs completely untrue. 10% test positive end dying doesn‚Äôt mean 10% people virus end dying. Testing biased towards symptoms, know lot asymptomatic cases. hear you. stressful times  live Canada work permit. car PA plates. amount nasty looks receive people right good.

And know blame? jackasses think cute use loophole ""driving Alaska"" BC (spoiler alert: lot times, they're not) take holidays places like Banff, Victoria, others. 

They're making us legally look like scumbags, I'm sick it. needs tougher enforcement rules, including bans everyone thinks they're entitled enter either immediately self-isolate drive *directly* to/from Alaska nothing barest minimum stops. 

The fact Canada gracious enough allow Americans road access Washington Alaska BC Yukon courtesy, right. *might* happen next January, hopefully point it'll helped vaccine dispensation. think saying could made masks order. fair China, large majority wear masks anyway. Also masks nothing people wont wear them. Mistakes made around country blame situation anyone else. ^ Word. Thank taking seriously. Ca here, 33. shut shit early missed worst first wave yeah it‚Äôs rise like everywhere else. Here‚Äôs hoping don‚Äôt see ‚Äúmobile morgues‚Äù pop behind hospital. lifelong complications? mention months-long recovery rate? Anyone needs recover months probably lose job. side effects? Apparently nobody gives shit unless someone dies virus. lose everything end permanent health issues arising virus cares, right? ‚Äúcrisis standards‚Äù reverse triage? Rouge sell lots individual stuff. cheap though. 

Dicks sells individual dumbbells. 60 lbs.
Pick only. everyone stay home relax without mask skip risking Covid-19?  colonies belong us started strong. Enacting stricter environmental rules. downhill since though. hope two weeks inauguration. . . . Life easy give shit anyone yourself. Arizona wondering had/have it. minor breathing problems slight cough, sometimes happens vape. normally do, stop inhaling, started get better. Right around breathing got back normal, woke 1 fever, chills, nausea, vomiting. peaked day, fever reaching 101.8 finally breaking noon next day--only briefly come back evening finally going away altogether. spent pretty much entire first day bed drifting fever dreams. this, force eat, easy first. fever broke, another 3 days random waves nausea chewing reduced appetite. also dizziness every evening evening fever. fading, breathing got little worse again, nothing bad. week symptoms, suddenly... diarrhea. ongoing 4-5 days symptom.

All all, whatever fairly mild. would consider really sick 1.5 days. little weather another 2 says. Everything beyond was/is mostly minor/odd inconveniences.

Does sound anything like COVID you? Mind you, lot indirect exposure. fiance nurse caring population residents almost reached 50% positive one point, many coworkers subordinates tested positive--including spent prolonged time without masks close proximity talking office. never got sick like did. chalked unusual allergies. big thing pointing death rates that‚Äôs usually crowd pointing case numbers months ago, hospital numbers weeks ago. 

The reverse.

Everybody fixated deaths deaths werent dramatic enough anymore, nobody talks them.

Even though fact US reporting lowest deaths since March certainly *somewhat* goes cases hospitalizations death order.


Ok explain Sweden.  see increasing cases beginning June recently think effect Sweden's death rate? like US, falling steadily.

So cases go hospitalization death, ""how things go""? Damn. Record. 

And higher day per capita LA county. 

Congratulations OC. Throwing shit fit masks all. pathetic people calling China lies numbers whereas US politicize masks, limited PPE, protests nothing 4 months already. July already people seeing bigger picture. she‚Äôll blame problems next 5 years. Great everyone life. agree point you‚Äôre making, onset symptoms, it‚Äôs usually mild enough working isn‚Äôt problem don‚Äôt even know you‚Äôre truly sick. 

Sometimes, barely even notice symptoms, masks would great aren‚Äôt sure you‚Äôre actually sick, whether it‚Äôs something noninfectious, like allergies, something quickly resolve own. It‚Äôs usually issue people work symptoms *extremely* mild.

Regardless, work isn‚Äôt place people gotta be. Still gotta go store, pick kids school, even doctor sometimes. Exactly.. Dunno caught quick. yiu did.. bad many insist wearing them. That's like fire chief saying: 'the building burning stable way, need put fire out'. A+ shitshow. Shutting second time huge catastrophe businesses, especially small mid-sized ones. necessary would've reacted sooner beginning spread. weak R-led government refuses accept reality. classes online, negates need here.  Based /r/worldnews, there's plenty stupid fucking people countries. There's many. It‚Äôs called damage control trying cover ass incrementally. also state didnt sign petition WHO, adjusting public ventilation costly...good timing though...for windowdressing. suspected.. Randian India mess. India testing par developed countries. Comparing number tests per million meaningless India 1 billion people. better parameter would positivity rate. US positivity rate somewhere around 9%. India's positivity rate 6.7%. Yes number cases reported, problem exists throughout world due multiple problems. 

India long way go bring pandemic control needs ramp testing more. calling response India's government mess far truth. could look average age died extrapolate based fatalities rate age group perhaps adjust preexisting conditions think that's good test, go really far make eyes really water. may end false negative test it. true??

It depends mean ""protect.""

Masks foolproof, block 50% incoming viruses 80% outgoing viruses (because viruses encapsulated water droplets - maybe 100% time, enough time) means reduce overall transmission 90%.

Does mean pretend virus gone away like could 100% effective protection (if ignore risk protection faulty worn improperly)? - safer mask. Hey nit pick, article article (or articles) Times. directly address ""Here's why"" got tired it. When's next season *America's Got Talent* coming?

/s According who? doubting curious someone finds stuff out.

I find twitter. crazy, she‚Äôs mainstream right world days. outsider, India appeared like one took quite seriously start, physical punishments (on level squats ass beating) people wear mask outside outside without good reason. I'd say population density others said. Something can't blocked, slowed down. hit people once. Things change matter minutes. Ever flu? Wake feeling slight discomfort, flossing way ER vomiting. Sickness strange mate. Strange. I‚Äôve waiting outbreaks start reported. might well accurate description yes, maybe exposure time period immunity acts like booster shot, knows. unlikely exposed many times course year though, unless high risk job region high number cases. mean, mask really issue. social distancing sucks though. stand seeing friends sporadically severely limiting sport activities work next months still. idea chance knowing new people even spotter gym much longer quite jarring.

Luckily company rolling back smart working allowing us site, people know happy family. last months fucking lonely, yeah moved back parents partner (or kids guess). least there's high 90's compliance rate face masks. denial get stronger closer get election. students may able transfer credits number Canadian universities. It‚Äôs going easy straightforward, might preserve academic progress election decided.

After that, it‚Äôs students decide want resume studies US.  Spanish flu burnt killing hosts. Germany well. one wears masks outdoors, they're universal shops public transport. can. would need online classes home country. ""Screw kids. *job* we're talking about, here!"" dude fucking tank. suppose crazy give inhuman resilience. Cancer whole bunch situations dressed one name. HIV complicated case, much pressure working treatments.

Vaccines coronaviruses already exist farm animals. Several SARS-1 vaccines considered essentially complete couldn‚Äôt make trials disease evaporated. India great consider resources population density. 
It's always cards hard contain epidemic India. 
 
US hand every opportunity limit it. Coz China already bought mask world virus spreading there, telling countries. 

Plus helped China cover situation, virus spread quickly around world God: ""What signs need show whatever think probably incorrect, genius?"" won't. prioritize better chance positive outcome.

No one said schools shuttered forever, one said lockdown forever. should, however, things (the right way) order get handle this, otherwise drawing killing economy time. Sure, one teaching. Go ahead open school without teachers, instead, kids docs. Jesus Christ... literally show whip sense em. Let‚Äôs rewrite headline:

*Only First-World Nation Fails Contain COVID-19 Withdraws World Health Organization* Dumbass Americans, fuck back shithole. That's thought saw article. might well say unicorns effectively kill coronavirus too. Majority western democracies reached herd immunity already ravaged. Florida, Texas, California, etc, shut *before* got hit, *unlike* majority western democracies. catching do. Luckily used time learn test treat covid, people states dying. Unlike, say, UK, France, Spain, Italy, etc, death tolls enormous. like never ending lockdowns  Harvard's tuition neither wealthy kids pay it. financial aid stellar. think point still enough. use whatever excuse want, still lack self control. know people can't stay home. obvious exception work groceries. According CDC, Texas expected see nearly 2,000 new hospitalizations per day mid-July.

Exactly 2,000/day figure come from? 8 days away mid July see impossible figure. someone show math? need remove profit motive healthcare. Medicare another type insurance requires time personnel pursue reimbursements wasting ?20% 30% funds. wasted money improve patient outcome.

Run healthcare like run military. Nationalize healthcare facilities/providers make government employees. institute draft men women option trained serve healthcare providers rather military. mandatory service interval elect continue United States Health Corp, discharged continue civilian providers leave healthcare altogether. 2 1 service requirement. 2 years every 1 year tuition free training. 

Present providers option continue civilian employees qualified enlist newly formed USHC previous experience pro-rated determining rank.

Most Americans aware 3 separate healthcare systems already. public system profit non profit hospitals, VA system veterans served less 20 years military system active duty personnel retired length service members. 3 best far military sytem. Lets adapt model provide level care Americans. Hundreds huh... They‚Äôll take seriously kid dies. says shit making people wear masks. Hurricanes another name ‚Äúvery strong sneezes‚Äù Yeah there's literally evidence support claim. wonder Brooks County plans placing people. county jail refusing misdemeanor arrestees person covid positive protect staff inmates. understand.

That's great. family service taking time energy patience engage conversation topics. 

Another perhaps less inflammatory angle is, ""do believe people wear seat belts living state fear?""

For persuading people tough topics can't recommend enough reading book Never Split Difference Chris Voss. completely designed FBIs hostage negotiation tactics huge efficacy. fostering empathy understanding making arguments demands. found incredibly helpful areas life.

A great real world example using conversation tactical empathy persuade Daryll Davis. black blues musician sought leading members KKK, befriended them, ultimately renounced ties KKK racist beliefs. truly incredible true story. He's given number interviews Joe Rogan podcast recently. find interview youtube. You‚Äôre supposed terrified forever man, get Reddit‚Äôs hive mind! We'll vaccine 2022 things largely go back ""normal."" ...I agree person downplaying seriousness covid, CFR 4.4% would imply 4.4% confirmed it, 95.6%. logic backwards there. Firnessblender.com hundreds free videos levels without weights. excuses working don‚Äôt need gym it.  Well...um...It‚Äôs July lol, thanks 8-D Obviously, never happen. Go look covid dashboard ca, 8.2% states cases 0-17 0.0% deaths fall age range. states countries data shows close same. believe chance kids dying covid basically zero. said user, data shows much higher would love see it.

I've never looked, many kids year 0-17 due year preventable diseases? pull everything every year. I'm trying downplay this, people overly afraid something new different. makes sense, humans afraid things encountered. Ive looked data come conclusion kids serious risk. seen new Top Gun movie like eleventy times now.

I hate Covid. Poor kids. get shot, sacrificed Trump's ego. I‚Äôm gonna feel sorry them. lifetime access Harvard alumni network present almost every city. like everyone else make best it. mean vast majority tools available success.

Yup! one big club. local shopping area part town gives masks free one. yeah normal 40 hour weeks. shift mid shift start late morning end evening. went hospital Heart Attack COVID system proceed die they‚Äôre labeling COVID death regardless COVID factor not.

To fair, COVID heart issues, good chance COVID cause significantly complicate heart attack. also caused strokes, kidney failure, liver failure, limb amputations (blood clotting feet), among things.

Basically, something wrong, COVID ramps 11 blood stops functioning like blood.

Lungs common issue numerous tiny capillaries get plugged, that's far complication. Hell actually said article read ""we expect kind behavior BU students, Harvard students."" Great reason shut one three times fun year. Really pisses off. new generation students even memory like, kills alum.  agree, ‚Äúcrazy doomers‚Äù saw coming?...more like educated theorists posess mathematical, scientific, analytical skills needed order make educated prediction certainly ring true! came say wording.. fact it‚Äôs press release small company, etc Covid probably causes neurological damage leading car accidents 

Sudden strokes article linked says Texas 500 new hospitalizations today. Texas ""blown by"" 2000 hospitalizations per day mentioned above?

500 way less 2000. took scientists nearly 40 years realize Zantac causes cancer. There‚Äôs way scientists fully understand long-term effects rushed vaccines. Exactly. Additionally churches pay taxes, charitable works TAX FREE. That's State issue. 10th amendment. Lockdown early, slowed growth rate due lack compliance. people follow lockdown, might well reopen hope youth protects enough population. documented section bill multi-trillion dollar bill..

No limited statement western democracies. rest world much different perspective personal freedom, governments able use tools control spread virus western countries would consider invasion privacy stand for. That's see periodic flare ups countries quickly result localized lockdowns. I'm taking ball going home. prefer this;

Watching cops show give everyone $1000 would probably shut idiocy fast.

The city said intend aggressively enforce bylaw, change pretty fast Ford Tory get annoyed looks tv. think hesitant Covid19 vaccine pretty reasonable. Particularly people positions power think rush one out. 

On side note pray politics get involved release it, great antivax movement unstoppable. vaccine better one damage honest. OK relevant US? never bad UK US 4 months now. pretty much scenario one Facebook friends.

She's nurse posted pics saying excited join ER team hospital started around March.

Then 4th July earlier weeks see pics people mask. high risk vector infuriates me, know well enough say anything matter.

And guess what, saying ""the flu kills people"" lockdown started. single Facebook apology since then. least stopped spouting bullshit. problem: lot, mainly f-up current state Covid crisis. 


Yes, racism fact life America. Everyone know that. know that, know that. Frankly, call racist too. ok people racist, fight government imposed racist agenda. lesson took history WW2. guess count one problems. 


First, protesting: lot ethnic groups protesting non-black. head, protesting Native American regarding oil pipeline. Recently, Vietnamese people protesting Covid shutdown Santa Ana, view stupid stupid people come color allow speak, apparently. Another problem.

Second, destroying/rioting/looting properties: statement unfortunately read like Black people it, bit biased view. hope case come across videos Vietnamese people participate. found shameful accept bastards kind skin color. Third problem.

Finally, correct, life group. Frankly, humanity disappear life continue. mean can't put comment reddit ask can't say Black Lives Matter say believe Lives Matter ? Fourth final problem. Understand concept advocating, trend skyrocketing.. say? ""We 2 beds; another 2 patients almost ready discharged?""

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Every single study releasedy either false complete nonsense. harm good, good riddance. 

They lied repeatedly China, removed guidance Chinese herbs receiving donation China, lied human human transmission, lied asymptomatic/presymptomatic spread, downplayed masks, still deny airborne spread, etc. guidance worse common sense every way, helped COVID spread over. homeless drug addict homeless drug addict birth? Doubt it

Also that's interesting point. We're parents born children birth? dont think so. deserve food stamps poor choices. Maybe state taken away? Good you. took anxiety channeled gaining ten pounds baking weight. I‚Äôm even trump hater fucking hilarious. America making look absolute joke way people handling this. Coming hanks that‚Äôs brutal one patient hospital super fit, 40, works trains multiple times week. fighting life right now, co morbidifies preexisting conditions, might make it. looking good. I'm genuinely scared, person isnt healthy enough survive hell makes rest us think survive it?!? mind blowing. WHO, institution refuses accept virus transmitted via aerosol

That's false. [WHO guidance use taken less position since least February:

_In specific circumstances settings procedures generate aerosols performed, airborne transmission COVID-19 virus may possible._ Wow shocked. shocked. Never would thought could shocked. Huh, must've missed one. leaves determined good clinical practices followed due speed done, guess we've relaxed safety standards considerably.

Appreciate information. think drastic setback, minority areas. understand behavior cause death illness others, scope limited personal lives.

It really minimal though. Hundreds attendance likely super spreader event. Compare lack leadership government, particular. People actual authority promoted policies conspiracies far reaching, across entire nation. Holding indoor political rallies thousands attendance, masks social distancing. Politicians betraying oath public disobeying lawful ordinances higher authorities, encouraging others to.

Even absolute worst scenarios though temporary. Covid us forever. I'm anyway trying diminish vile nature protester's ignorance. mother, one person genuinely afraid for, passed Saturday Covid. good health. come accept likely pass soon shit went down. lament fact forced alone happened day again.

Suppressing dissent silencing grievances government, even dangerous ones, characteristic see good society. 

I would fully support sticking relevant way. mask ordinance fines violations, fine all. suggestions simply vindictive. Yup. grandmas already dead. Im 37, thing gonna kill me. appropriate level fear zero me. use antibiotics treat acne, due anti-inflammatory action.

Bacterial superinfections occur viral infections, especially severe. Antibiotics given, still are, many covid infections.

I defending actions, however careful stating things fact internet - anywhere. logic get told ""it's unhealthy breathe CO2!"" ""Pay attention totally unrelated pneumonia spikes, please reference post month"" vaccine 100% effective 100% people create 'herd immunity'. this. *doctors scientists*. please stop believing things doctors say epidemiology areas science absolutely real education in. goes things like nutrition--they get half semester best, follow guidelines, that's it. give good basic advice? maybe. experts dietetics? absolutely fucking not. experts anything besides diagnosing treating whatever specialty is. trust nowhere else. they're fighting doctors whether aerosolized. think saw college. Yes, know, terribly irresponsible me.

I'm indefensible defense, 15ish years ago law use phone car without hands-free device.

I makeup car more, either, that's mostly want makeup look like crap. makeup driving since high school. adrenaline rush comes curling one's lashes applying mascara 50 mph... I'm joking, obviously, incredibly stupid thing do.

It's luck injure/kill others myself, children put stop reckless behaviour. Look smile guy. Cover mask tool. Understood. sideman would think better position keep gigs around. city in? Yep. going get truly fucking dark. Hospital staff getting issued Kevlar vests wear scrubs point, they're even getting masks, course getting support face shitheads. 

Even drove away, many hours couple full days escalation; People threatening other, FEMA people finally arrived point drove couple hours, people raided shit left behind, came back couple FEMA trucks tons cops, local enough side violent neighbours turned real shit show. 

By time leaving, descending total lawlessness cops decided leave kind weird peace treaty thing FEMA locals left duke out. Eventually FEMA people overwhelmed completely shitty small supply load brought, left never came back day two presence day 15+ post-hurricane struggle water limited food everyone else. 

People violent stole it, lot people went completely without aid.

With coronavirus shit, going thousand times that, much larger scale. going good. walk 5 miles school, snow...  together now... PAY IT?!?!?!? 

(Country goes flailing public health crisis burning GDP many lesser nations far worse outcomes.) FamousJester gets Reddit account his/her posts going EXPLODE curve we‚Äôve seeing months leave us. ever learn? pull federal state funding do. Lol sure, teachers also screwed this. news always talking plan school districts have, one talks changes actually implemented. Overworked underpaid teachers sanitize throughout day, adapt teaching split learning, somehow keep kids touching other.

So much really messed  I‚Äôve vegan years fakes gotten much better even started. Beef pretty much done deal, along pork too. Chicken companies work on. eat fake chicken sometimes it‚Äôs never good. Gardein something need perfect it. Chicken nuggets don‚Äôt count even real ones taste like fake ones anyway. bad flu! /s Nothing suspicious it. died direct result decisions. driving local Starbucks yesterday slow moving traffic. Saw manager standing outside front entrance, mask arms crossed. front generic Karen, roll windows maskless self laying hard imagine about. 

This pandemic brought crazies, every single day see someone showing everyone around dim witted are. Says child abuser. Yall wait see. little map show new infections occured today UK, anyone interested 

Hoping track numbers day weekly increases, useful. That's true. get vaccine mid 2021 maybe help. see affective governance right - wait science comes through.  course number anti-vaxxers there, knows even work. Florida Man Dan.
Dan scared old ladies.
Dan freaked public lost job it.
Don't like Dan. Exactly. can‚Äôt imagine opportunity escape higher ground massive flood stay yell wet water is. link says 11 days symptoms death, quick google search average 5 days exposure symptoms, would 16 days infection death. might studies showing 18 day figure. clearly thinks still forrest gump wish reports shared amount available healthcare workers areas (especially ones trained intensive care and/or ventilator support). Hospital staffing normal times issue US. 


It sounds like many going use ER space resources manage overflow. overflows. 

I‚Äôm frustrated angry sad. fucking scary autoimmune diseases appear seemingly nowhere. terrible stressful event, sickness, pregnancy... boom, body completely changed rest life. Sorry happened you.

I wish understood bodies go rails like this. reason. Corporations using opportunity eliminate competitors, destroy small businesses, collect stimulus funds. Banks using opportunity eliminate cash, usher pure digital currency. Wealthy people currently completing largest transfer wealth poor rich history. got $1200, worth less government injected trillions economy  This. 


The protests approving media coverage signaled world done COVID. Three weeks later back COVID shaming meantime people saw went ""you gather thousands screaming can't barbecue?"" tragic, that's failure parent, state. state take custody away terrible parents.

Yes system terrible frequently leads drug addiction. chance nearly fits ""narrative"" statistics? maybe underlying reason/cycle play? 

And imagine much better gdp nation could citizens happy healthy instead of... Well feel free look numbers THOSE. crazier claim 7200 24k would get infected somehow.

Its like two models:

1. Virtual campus everybody acts like everything otherwise 100% normal, 

2. On-campus education strict testing everybody behaves exactly way they're supposed behave. words (""I FEEL THREATENED"") actions (aggressively approaching person filming him) rectangular bulge shirt suggestive someone trying weaponize Florida's ""stand ground"" law get away literal murder. Rick Scott actually claimed good environmental record senate run. Voters pretty much never fact check. assuming America stayed full lockdown like...the end June. make sense either well, BMI put risk group Covid19, anymore. Keep up! reach ideal BMI. Even lower death rates, 20% get sick going hospital, almost half recover serious damage thier lungs organs require long term care help.

This thing killing hundreds people, crippling thousands thousands more. people dying it. Special Investigation? Let's see people made choices, got people killed. money, politics, jail. Trump trying look good November something ? C-C-C-Combo!! Surely BaDeeDoDa qualified scientifically incorrect view vs tom hanks scientifically correct view.


Fucking go back trailer park need money lots absolutely hysterical now, part sad part hilarious. Take break arguing social media. arguments incoherent looks like taking toll mental health. comment racist all. Shame you. Racism disease. pointing it‚Äôs racist many westerners lump Asians together without respecting difference. accurate count number recoveries, would see people leaving hospital faster admitted. 
But one sub. seems interested recoveries. Guessing he's permanently banned store them. could done, would require computers.

The programmer says could *just* get everyone install contact-tracing app, could use geolocation services easily ping everyone broad proximity within last two weeks test positive! It'd downright *trivial*!

The realist says people going wear masks, sure *fuck* going install app tracks (even though phone *already* tracks them, Google Apple downright *eager* tell law enforcement want know). Maybe could piggyback TikTok, already giant box Chinese spyware anyways. Indiana *Fever*.

Heh. Testing positive going life like nothing changed absolutely fucking result punishment. actual fuck wrong people? 130k people dead bullshit like this.  going stop people forced stop. fucking July far away fall. absolutely got get handle going see death tolls like never before. dont either. put fucking mask x( Damn, guess friend learn covid hard way. honestly, seems like way Americans learn hard truth experience course, that‚Äôs obviously exactly said. Times tough it‚Äôs good hear surge positivity.

Maybe relevant entirely ppe kinda culture.  That's possible too, though I'm feeling time line pass. Although possible, covid like hepatitis. Intituinal think another strain I'm doctor biologist 330 million people US, find others country.

Who, exactly? Bingo! set society almost require it. BIZARRE people children (I 3) hand institution raise 8+ hours day. Since raising children become unnatural way? Many European countries give parents loads paid time birth understand importance forming natural bond. knew woman pregnant kept repeating, ‚ÄúI back work 6 weeks exactly, staying home.‚Äù back work 6 weeks dot-newborn daycare‚Äîand repeated cycle.

Well-well, look. already told you: deal god damn customers agents to. people skills; good dealing people. Can't understand that? hell wrong people? supremely naive take Doctors get way; way micro pharm nurse even CRNA. get lot. 

And still defer PharmDs drug knowledge. 

Doctors whole speciality Infectious Disease training micro pharm. 

Doctors get lot. 

PharmDs work Infectious Disease hospitalists come date antibacteriograms hospital specific physicians known exactly use patient population hospital. 

We don‚Äôt fuck around kind stuff. Whys tom hanks getting praised common sense sound like internet badass I'm violent person someone they're getting punched. Omg say ain‚Äôt so! multimillionaire actor? and? time hand actually brigading shit like that, matter, there's little Swedish even European content ? 

I mean 90% posts sub shitting US exclusively STILL see much whining Americans it. that's even pro-Trump hellholes like t_d getting axe recently userbase spreading broader reddit community.
