It kills me, swear. crap put people refuse vaccines masks get sick like warned could avoided suddenly nice them?

How many people infect died? compassion people? Boo hoo consequences forewarned about. insurance premiums pay hospital bills. said, environments schools, believe masks slated enforced.

Not SC. brilliant governor said schools can't mandate mask wearing. free all. Anyone compromised immune system unfortunately take precautions (just like pre pandemic) avoid covid also measles flu, etc Everyone seems forget CDC makes recommendations. mandate mask first place can't cancel state's /locality's mandate. make sign says ‚Äúyou come without mask say loud Joe Biden duly elected President‚Äù I'm OP say town grew MMA training gym owner convinced son died SIDS actually died vaccines. last several years, he's telling anyone everyone get vaccines--COVID changed remotely.

Also, Joe Rogan big MMA guy said vaccines necessary.  would require empathy, compassion, self awareness. guessing typo first sentence... vaccinated people don‚Äôt need masks. love vaccine passports wish every building them.  family friend last year began advocate safety precautions even medical interventions following taking medicine shows lack faith God's ability protect us. I'm sorry, God save man devout Alfred Great Crohn's Disease I'm sure shit going saved case Crohn's either I'll keep taking life saving medicine tyvm.

(I know Alfred confirmed Crohn's suspected enough Wikipedia mentions good enough inconsequential Reddit comment)  PA isn‚Äôt past point. Frontline workers weren‚Äôt even eligible time general public. It‚Äôs shit show trying get scheduled get vaccine. can‚Äôt third wave level immunity Americans previous infection vaccines. Plus don‚Äôt make policy decisions today based ifs Well, they‚Äôre like mom, waited past Friday get vaccine. scared ‚Äúwanted see everyone else did‚Äù getting vaccinated. leaning toward getting vaccine finally convinced lot talks.

Her second dose June 4. live Canada! ü•≤ Yeah hard understand? Keep masking kid then. I‚Äôm vaccinated get stop. family member OD Tylenol nurse told ""nah, fine take much. I'm nurse know I'm talking about""

So sometimes kind side eye someone nursing license giving complex medical advice unless I've interacted enough they've personally earned trust 3% adult population US immunocompromised vaccine partially completely ineffective 

This include allergic. kids. took responsibility family, followed scientific advice wore goddamn mask long wherever necessary. also got vaccinated soon available. pandemic officially family 5 weeks last one household 2 weeks past second shot. everyone took vaccine.  Already did. Sorry got offended corrected ""reason logic"" actual scientific reality. people get flu shot. think it‚Äôs 50% get it. it‚Äôs anything like COVID A) it‚Äôs nearly infectious B) much less deadly C) people already immunity prior seasons. 

Regarding children, numbers population‚Äôs risk level, individual child‚Äôs risk, don‚Äôt think telling parents ‚Äúit‚Äôs 1 1000 chance dying kid gets it! They‚Äôre least affected, don‚Äôt worry it!‚Äù vaccine available everyone two months. people dragging feet clearly aren‚Äôt worried virus. US around 70% people form protection virus, via vaccine natural immunity, 70% people can't catch virus spread it, impossible huge ""surge"" happen. Thanos agrees  That's feature media that's manipulating you, failing Doctor's part. people protect either getting free vaccination wearing inexpensive mask, job concern. Children 4x higher risk vaccinated adults. That's perspective. Well people put gasoline plastic bags... amount clearly stated direction handholding help...  understand shot doesn‚Äôt make ‚Äúsafe‚Äù everyone? older sick loved ones remain high risk long case counts remain elevated. vaccine gives us way tamp whole disease manageable levels everyone participate. matters much people get vaccinated risk people actually care about. every 60 secs Africa one minute passes Yea virus R rate 1.0. exposed less less day. Multiple factors play  ask election..you‚Äôll know  Perhaps feel duty help change. Guess going find effective vaccine is. people vaccinated it. Hmm. Sounds like time machine.   shitting me!  No, genuinely believed COVID aerosol-based virus, droplet based

Yes, fucking stupid them. I'm sorry, multiple events early pandemic strongly pointed aerosol spread mechanism droplets. Events like Seattle Choir event, rapid spread COVID South Korean cult. 

Scientists Asia made good calls soild recommendations early on. Western experts totally dropped ball need it. needed expert tell us thisü§£ think highly regional. NJ got 70% adults first shot yesterday 50% fully vaxxed... mask especially good adult sized faces (kn95, n95, etc.). ones approved use kids cloth mask, though definitely providing small amount protection wearer still protecting others wearer. Jewish space lasers  suggesting every person died c absolutely healthy? 

Of course not, absolutely healthy. said responsibility right thing people unhealthy lifestyles don‚Äôt think anyone ever said anything spreading US all. always keeping people hospitalized dying. First flatten curve lockdown (in theory population going catch trying overwhelm hospitals catching time), wearing masks social distancing part population would deadly. important risk groups wasn‚Äôt anything could besides everyone social distancing wearing masks. continuing give guidance reduce hospitalization death. always goal, it‚Äôs nearly impossible eradicate disease (we legit measles outbreaks many many years vaccine available) I'm literally walk get shot whenever want major pharmacies.  people made wearing mask identity scared part husband keeping feel better it. millions kids can't vaccinated, I'm willing risk health wear lip gloss Yeah. first read title quote first thing went head. turn made realize kind horrid thought have, especially number people taking jab physically cannot whatever reason (or permitted age). It‚Äôs also important note CDC never made masking mandate. guidance let state local governments know follow guidance. particular, current guidance says state local governments still charge handle masks, overall guidance vaccinated people good go. It‚Äôs definitely huge balancing act here‚Ä¶ one hand want keep people safe, other, CDC wants people know vaccines working effective long stand behind masking, there‚Äôs gonna lot people say ‚Äúwell vaccines work, vaccinated people still wearing masks?‚Äù lucky. Florida, would illegal. Also news today, ice cold! Brrrrrrrr..... CDC claimed masks work. later decided suddenly super important. expert vaccinated okay worried wear mask still. Problem solved. kind app something show someone vaccinated not?  potentially world get new variant slips past vaccines... person who‚Äôs partially vaccinated already risk severe infection death greatly reduced. part political party regardless side makes stooge y‚Äôall keep fighting exactly want Im lazy dig links understanding 80-90% effectiveness 1st shot alone. LOL, I'm area pretty much everyone wears one indoors...I'm going lie, going super weird seeing people wear one first. think normalcy happen see employees supermarkets wearing one. Still, seems inevitable point. There's fixing amount stupid got someone point they're still unvaccinated free, willfully ignorant choice. point brace impact. I'm going honest anyone surprised ? take risk It‚Äôs bunch scientists PR staff. I‚Äôm dismayed aren‚Äôt good handling public policy, surprised. kids Whoulda thunk? Next you‚Äôll tell people don‚Äôt wear seatbelts risk hurt crash! Ordinary people simply act according practicality, usually goodfaith. Framing problem honesty, ignoring rampant falsehood deceit espoused daily basis big corporations, government ""experts"" expertly (miserably) handled pandemic, mark dishonest buffoon. Heard doomsday predictions UK variant, SA variant Brazil variant. cry Wolf many times. I've tried multiple different kinds. really uncomfortable hot breath face, re-breathing hot mix fresh exhaled air, often glasses fog up. Uncomfortable enough I'm going going things without mask.

To sounds like can't imagine people different feelings tolerances things. We've given year lives .01%. getting bit hand. I'm playing game anymore.

First said delivered. Secondly, everyone time vaccine kick yet. get? Asthma listed comorbidity. Thats useful highlighting kids 12 sprained ankle. Seems like slip part, doesn‚Äôt mean wasn‚Äôt risky. Flu easily fatal newborns mother hasn‚Äôt passed antibodies, woman kind quality prenatal care repeatedly cautioned make sure anyone around newborn received tdap vaccination. Like, understand caution.

But time feel like knee-jerk reaction union head considering there's scientific reason ask vaccinated people continue masking, CDC acted based combined undeniable free fall metrics that's sustained weeks past two nights I‚Äôve weird real life dreams people masked unmasked different situations, often weird. fuck. Anyone else strange dreams? Also government thinking saying could take things stores stuff. doesn‚Äôt feel over... people still getting covid...  Every single American age 16 get shots, sure rest world vaccinated, need wear mask. vaccinated, need wear mask. extremely simple common sense. Exactly. I'm fully immunized want bring home child Lol that's response. That's can't argue point. duh? guess I‚Äôm speaking general policy CDC. wouldn‚Äôt expect wait absolute zero risk order change policy masses. science says children age ranges remaining low risk, follow science. thought social contract agreed (at least us believe science). 

I know conversation full land mines, honestly open changing position evidence. starting feel like pushback mask policy change less science says makes scared people feel better. Fo sho \*Source: Watching videos society past year. Captain Obvious, paging Captain Obvious. masks 100% effective protecting wearer people around wearing one gotten vaccinated?

No. 100%. work shown work. use figure 100%? point it? Even 30% without it, mandated would reduce number infections shit ton virus spreads exponentially. anxiety disorder due PTSD probably related. Americans trusted. whole reason US dire situation virus selfishness want wear mask.

Whenever go outside public places see someone without mask. always treat virus there's chance might.  That's right, covid didnt go mask mandate removed, went shots work well render masks moot. really expect run get vaccinated bc random anonymous redditor aggressively demanded go get it? Mmkay. really poorly handled. said lot video. Addressed edge cases. unvaccinated kids? immunocompromised people home? Even answer ""those people safe"" addressed it. Oh God. reminded whole disinfecting groceries too. crazy! vacuum sure, masks physiological effect keeping people away things. know would try avoid long event wear mask whole time.

My friends Philippines still fully locked down. want American tech get asap. shit  lie, what? They'll hurting since rest us fully protected. Screw 'em.  went gym today half people unmasked. everybody gym masked. least live everyone followed mask mandates inside businesses. Even work everyone followed mask mandate. CDC making ruling try convince others get vaccinated. Let‚Äôs act like good public health. masks 100% effective protecting wearer people around wearing one gotten vaccinated? risk complications healthy children higher flu compared COVID-19. However, infants children underlying medical conditions increased risk flu COVID-19.

Flu worse statistically COVID kids. didn‚Äôt everyone wearing masks flu.

The people vulnerable COVID option protected. thought that.  ignore risk? How‚Äôs working Brazil India? Mitigation measures don‚Äôt work? Laughable. Guess China, NZ Australia got lucky right? Show one country ignored covid currently well. one. value short term gratification long term prosperity that‚Äôs business please keep south middle nowhere importantly far away society. anyone first unmasked public event, masks done them. It‚Äôs happened wife I‚Äôm gonna say this‚Äîfrankly, strange‚Äîanecdote exception rule. can't wear masks? people jobs, champ.  People really think kids gonna take us around 50% 85% vaccinated. Kids anti vax parents anything half max getting lying vaccination record like, pretty significant crime? Lol sound literally exact anti maskers. problem vaccinated people wearing masks. problem mask mandates going away right obviously going vaccinated people ditching masks. Trump lost. know tough, going ok walked Walmart first time today unmasked. felt sense guilt, think that‚Äôs we‚Äôre wired last year. initial bad feeling, realize you‚Äôre following guidelines organization told first place, felt liberating. welsh thing do. Why

Not getting vaccine irresponsible. honest question, anyone know implemented things? Considering phone us almost time, common medical information stored touch fingers case emergencies? 

Ik medical id exists, pretty limited many people even use Don‚Äôt think required expert We‚Äôre not. We‚Äôre vaccinating. Yes got that. then. people listen. entire reason we're first place. response better, here.   People lie? WWWHHHHHAAAAAAAAAA care lie? Get vaccinated issue you. dishonest taking risk. not. currently plenty vaccine anyone wants - care?
.. quite certain have, Israel seeing herd immunity starting kick little point. UK might weeks away herd immunity despite variant. ever manage eradicate smallpox? like issue 50 years ago. still masking here, vaccinated; setting example might save lives still 95 million vaccinated. 132 deaths among far. sure keep watching death rate, think appropriate response level threat. great year masks. Now, put business ask respect premises follow rules. I‚Äôm putting w business still requires it. Why? store doesn‚Äôt require it, government doesn‚Äôt require it, I‚Äôm fully vaccinated, I‚Äôve worn thing year people, it‚Äôs over. allowed scared don‚Äôt force others scared shit get chance use it. dodos bought fake card probably wasted money.  live mask mandates all. Maybe 80% people still wear indoors. Bruh still said sorry I‚Äôve observed myself. Dear lord... grasp this... sarcastic taking person's logic logical extent.

That never solution. Understand now?  *Sighs rewatches sport-climbing qualifiers.* No, expects unvaccinated people know risk wearing mask point free take risk.

Those fully vaccinated (waiting can‚Äôt get it) continue wearing mask distancing themselves‚Ä¶just like before. course lie lol tell groups saying masks evil...... Duh. That‚Äôs continuing education required maintain licensure. It‚Äôs like school full time 8 years. I'm pretty sure planes/bridges reliable vaccines.  title wasn‚Äôt changed. url

Also mask mandate lifted vaccinated people PA, businesses choose keep mandates want to. care wear masks. care they're trying make vaccinated wear masks, too. there's issue. nobody said that. 60% adults least one dose protection far greater mask give. Anyone else age 12 go get vaccine today want protected. Cases going 50 states. hope continue vaccinate many people possible.

It still emergency children September get fast tracked. There's small chance emergency still.

I definitely believe eventually get full approval. Emergency authorization different hurdle. No, science supports vaccinated people longer needing take precautions. It‚Äôs unfortunate data evidence conflicts worldview doesn‚Äôt change reality. Someone fat fingered data. twice many vaccinated today yesterday. want expert opinion, expertly, people lie

Source: expert. liar. point is... since grasping it, that's person's logic, people wear N95 protect themselves, cares people do! literally said mask mandate necessary made people wear N95. course they‚Äôll fucking lie. They‚Äôre selfish enough get vaccine fight masks; think selfless enough lie ?  kinds miniscule risk There's nothing idiots, move forward. Get shots can. can't keep protecting like past year. I'm sorry idiots making life difficult fault own.  Yup. ever seen anti masker public wear mask? It‚Äôs either 1) chin unless walk door 2) hanging nose 3) loose 4) something fumble around put scene waiter never even put 5) shitty cloth ‚Äúmask‚Äù. weren‚Äôt following rules anyway. certainly permission shed masks everyone. going near impossible enforce masking guidance CDC. Unless institute vaccine passports...which ain't gonna happen. simply honor system also ain't gonna work. country full people think themselves.  Christ people hoarding gasoline shopping bags last week....  Look back realize ridiculous are, lol. 

You explosively confronted them? you‚Äôre surprised people laugh you? I‚Äôd rather wear masks. it‚Äôs definitely easy do. couple people die let virus rip half population unchecked. I‚Äôm definitely cool asthmatic kids know higher risk hospitalization even death forgotten can‚Äôt continue fight months get vaccinated. yet businesses still keep doors windows closed.

Keep damn door windows open. think seriously terrible. god [The Japanese gov planning gather 810000 students school Tokyo don‚Äôt attend, you‚Äôll get marked absent. big duh Good. think knew like 14 months ago. news: Water Wet Give single source then. yet. one tried said exactly said. i‚Äôm vaccinated still hate said even care know they're killing. people piece quotes phycologists exactly, can't find source showing percentage hospitals requiring BSN entry requirement. found older article this, found California's ""BSN 10"" law, required associate degree RNs get BSN degrees. also found Stat 46% employers require BSN, distinguish hospitals employers. saw AACN's push 80% nurses BSN 2020... none articles said actually reached goal. 

I think right. I'm used looking reqs larger cities, smaller hospitals probably reaching magnet status. Thanks, needed something like this. shouldn‚Äôt care either. Read article please couldn‚Äôt agree catchy yawns. I'm glad convinced her. Honestly people afraid vaccine make want tear hair out. chance catch COVID much, much higher infinitesimally small chance adverse effect vaccine wish people could conduct risk assessment logically instead letting fear unknown take over. Good talking it! dominant strain moment... Wait till becomes dominant strain. immune escape. article April, reports month shown variants increasing children‚Äôs reactions infection.

Read WaPo article uselessness sinopharm Sychelles. /r/noshitsherlock Came say  mean blunt, but... shit. Children 2 recommended wear masks. kids ages 6mo 2 years? People can't keep child isolated 2 whole years. Covid like shit newborns vaccinated young age either. actual ongoing pandemic. CDC basically given idea protecting children allowing bullshit mask order revision sake trying encourage people get vaccinated. going allow unvaccinated people spread virus risk, cant wear mask must trust others right thing protect them.  Exactly, new? 99% gets really small human population damn big Sure can. Listen up, stay distanced. 

It‚Äôs less risky flu kids, also top 10 killing them.....which didn‚Äôt exist before. behave flu seasons kids? Exactly this. don‚Äôt mean imply anything person you‚Äôre responding to, friend mine insists can‚Äôt get covid vaccine die, gets pretty severe reaction gets flu vaccine. also regularly talks thinks covid vaccine rush vaccine, potentially flawed.

It‚Äôs totally different vaccine multiple different types, guy hasn‚Äôt even bothered ask doctor get covid vaccine. I‚Äôm doctor, really can‚Äôt know sure eligibility, time it‚Äôs seems like uses ‚ÄúI‚Äôm medically ineligible‚Äù convenient way avoiding admission he‚Äôs actually anti-vax general.


But want mention one time I‚Äôm trying imply previous posters, story kinda tangentially related. organization spent February March 2020 telling people get masks, all. mandated offer 3 hours personal leave get vaccine BC. additonal mandatory 3 sick days coming effect.

My employer super supportive, still gets annoyed people. One guy booked 11am, shift ends 2 Friday. extremely short staffed bit annoying. going make big deal he's getting vaccine weekend take care potential side effects.

Canada bit different story US now. blasting ahead first shots, US stalling 45%. right schedule tracking 70% adults D1 end first week June. group Anti-Vaxxers they're big States.

It honestly looks like UK first fully reopen, Canadian Provinces far behind. concerts scheduled first week July. FUCKING SHIT Either something rampant misinformation causes mass deaths. point. 

I doctor's today (afraid caught something else) joke congratulated going partying night fully vaxxed. 

The cute MD cute PA literally gave props going living life vaccinated.

I'm seriously joking True default. People die! Idgaf! They‚Äôve dying since life began stop afraid death fucking pussies! vaccinated people. mostly keep mask keep others around comfortable. hate much, it‚Äôs better incoming stress builds know people around freaking out. [And find another expert refute life grand? hasn‚Äôt already hit America. almost near unrestricted travel country months. variant alive well yet fine. variant anymore severe deadly, according preliminary studies vaccines variant stood strong preventing severe cases covid. part California's mask mandate remaining effect June 15th, seems lot reasonable relying antivaxxers lie say they're vaccinated go maskless everywhere. really feels like CDC throwing hands saying fuck it. really going pretend everything back normal again? agree fully. ‚Äúsmall dogs only‚Äù thing total bullshit smallest guy little terror, much barky tears carpet. bigger two quiet, don‚Äôt tear around house much calmer - love little shit rented would dumb one allowed based size alone. Honestly hell want though? Nothing going make idiots stop idiots. vaccinated protected, spread it. like anti maskers following mask mandates anyways, wearing nose hanging chin. There's nothing done morons, there's point wasting mental energy anymore. coronavirus Bible. fact anyone like ‚Äúwell duh‚Äù, said well duh rest ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è dystopian things I‚Äôve heard today, pray daily people like never gain sort political power. mentioned science, data evidence yet present any. Yes, assuming science deniers anti-vaxxers lie vaccination status endanger people. along suddenly become conscientious now. think took Biden administration well Fauci lot healthcare professionals surprise. Plus onus front line workers, fully vaccinated yet, keep people honest others safe. big difference wearing masks forever, obviously doesn‚Äôt make sense, wearing sufficient number vaccinated people protect vulnerable.
And, mandate masks winding mass vaccination sites, since anyone walk pharmacies get shot without appointment. Oh news, water colorless us got Moderna need boosters. Wish pfizer vaccine. happy get vaccinated first place dont wanna die. next Moderna booster wont even covering deadly variants, ones already here, booster 4 come end year variants. og Moderna vaccine ""near 100% effective"" wouldnt need boosters. hit nail head. That‚Äôs exact belief. simply speeding. Drivers road self absorbed jerks even without alcohol. I‚Äôm starting think may strategy reach herd immunity. we‚Äôre going via vaccines well people exposed. Obviously, don‚Äôt fully believe thought. It‚Äôs literally *millions* US, NYT article recently.

People even follow speed limits, causes deaths need be. less issue causing problems individualistic stupidity. CDC said it‚Äôs okay take mask indoors situations fully vaccinated random Reddit told CDC doesn‚Äôt know they‚Äôre talking guess I‚Äôll keep mask on. could make case person knew covid, otherwise absolutely fuck not. Lol don‚Äôt even know point is, would prefer link studies data show ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù people also dying old overweight asthmatic people? Low risk not, goal avoid amount kids dying. would introduce additional work actuaries, would raise everyone's rates (although much). think I'll trust woman PhD infectious diseases random redditor, bud. Adults maybe, two kids can‚Äôt get vaccinated yet. I‚Äôm definitely concerned them. people could sit down, relax, realize CDC trying job correctly. going say ‚ÄúVaccinated individuals safe 70% state vaccinated‚Äù ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt need mask keep mask people may lie‚Äù. science isn‚Äôt CDC‚Äôs responsibility, creating laws controlling policies. whole responsibility reason existence give us facts guidance diseases.

There‚Äôs much anger, division fear days, nobody happy guidance. don‚Äôt think cases rise said. lot people expect CDC independent state facts, people listen trust continue so. KF94s useful retired. God bless mRNA. trusting science, human behavior going change based messaging, made announcement people even time fully vaccinated. CDC also said fully vaccinated people free quote iconic Vines see fit.

Road work ahead? Uh yeah, sure hope does! Even mask mandate completely repealed, I'm still going wear mask go outside on. curb spread airborne viruses like common cold so. Yeah, divisive topic cautious people people waiting turning point normalize everything luck group upvotes downvotes you.  Actually entirely plausible people wear suncreen likely get sunburn since go frequently. People isolated home whole time lowest risk getting covid. neighboring counties dropping next year, way same. I‚Äôm happy this. kids 7 5. mention antivaxxers wearing masks whole time.  Also posted above, fyi:

From Footnotes section:  Funny impression wear masks according CDC. Remember said help? Maybe easier understand apprehension Exactly US perfect breeding ground it, unless first dose vaccinations rapidly pick up. Texas. governor dropped mask mandate month ago. shit. problem many abuse go without mask lying. prove aren‚Äôt vaccinated? fit vax passport, there‚Äôs way know. honor system doesn‚Äôt work America, haven‚Äôt able get vax yet (like kids, many pregnant women, etc.) mercy people helped put America shit spiral earlier year. Water wet need expert... new guidance really concerned people cannot get vaccinated due medical conditions. assholes lie vaccinated, refuse wear mask. They're going put people danger care. Ending mask mandate doesn‚Äôt mean masks effective COVID gone away. simply means plenty room hospital catch it. unmasking allows transmission (sure, symptoms usually) vaccinated folks. Every person person transmission, symptoms no, chance another mutation. new mask order basically inviting variant occur vaccines won‚Äôt protect against. wager, eh, ~6 months lockdown variant dangerous vaccinated. won‚Äôt end make everyone safe. Watch spikes hospitalization Covid deaths red, rural states. Alex Jones tell deep state along Bill Gates, George Soros, Nancy Pelosi, Biden, Chuck Schumer, Clinton's pedophile ring killing red voters secret virus developed China.

Good times.  Weird, seem remember completely control spread summer last year.  hate wife pregnant can‚Äôt get vaccine per doctor don‚Äôt know feel going stores don‚Äôt require masks [Pressure probably.  why?  Right thing endemic, actually manage contact tracing normal measures employ things control, outbreaks squashed quickly. Stating obvious. 

If form immunity, risk. Summer bring numbers even lower, covid going anywhere without herd immunity. another surge among without immunity next fall holiday season. like additional flu, replacement. vaccines there??? got second dose Feb 24 know talking about. really feel way considering easily get covid spread one people anyway vaccinated... Remove California New York that‚Äôs average rates country state Texas. Go look data. I'm full shit. know? vaccines work variants right now, stop paranoid there's reasonable possibility new variants could arise longer virus circulates. Anything say touting return 100% normalcy tolerated around here.

/s are. Significantly less risky regular flu. Kids aren‚Äôt really concern except spread adults. Exactly. vaccines truly modern miracles. people forgetting herd immunity achieved vaccines. immune response people recovered COVID also contributes. Anti vax people told they're fucking idiots actively endanger people's lives. actually pay fine every day vaccinated. guess that's fair. 

Happy report today zero deaths first time since started recording data, lowest hospitalizations 11 months, lowest seven-day rolling positivity rate seen all. Vaccinated people *can* get Covid, fewer symptoms get faster. live immunodeficient people definitely ignore version CDC advice persist wearing mask avoiding poorly-ventilated highly-populated spaces. *Especially* since Covid-deniers (still?) going going around public places unmasked unvaccinated.  Living divided state (MN), traveling different areas weekend, saw whole range outcomes:

-deep rural areas it‚Äôs over, masks 
-dirty looks masking urban area indoors/outdoor maskers
-suburban area brewery, people kind done hands

It kind fun see told you.  known lie. data say? posit 70-85% US ever going vaccinated.

What alternative moving forward? Taiwan reported 333 cases today. equivalent ~5k cases normalised US population.  think could say antivaxxers no? Next up: water wet. Amazing news! Yeah really. don‚Äôt know guidance people expected CDC release. 

They couldn‚Äôt keep saying ‚Äúwe‚Äôre sure vaccines prevent transmission‚Äù much longer without looking like ploy set aside evidence order keep people behaving way wanted (and exactly would be).

The best way come CDC make argument everyone making ‚Äúwe growing evidence vaccination significantly reduces infections transmission, masking social distancing still necessary fully vaccinated individuals unvaccinated people observing behaviors helps encourage practice themselves‚Äù. 

And it‚Äôs worth guidance might well received people obsessed anti-vaxxers/maskers, general public would laugh asses get rid masks anyway. put people speech marks? - dont consider antivaxxers people well? haven‚Äôt vaccinated more? voted logic. decisive affect decisions. votes make difference too. Brave redditor speaks dead antivaxxers need help bruh. Wait... I'm confused. Got first Astrazeneca dose couple hours ago. symptoms keep mind regarding rare clotting issue?

These people CDC claim public health experts. began pandemic telling us masks useless, despite fact disease spreading like wildfire enclosed spaces like cruise ships. began pandemic telling us closing borders would effect. bungled quarantine process people returning Wuhan. told us evidence community transmission US, simultaneously providing means detect community transmission US. 

These people ""reporting science."" making ""science"", saying ""no evidence"" rational proposals would taken reasonable person following precautionary principle.

It took *real scientists* Washington State rebelling ""public health experts"" reveal community spread. took *real scientists* speaking online get masks recommended general public. took *real scientists* talking dangers new variants get travel bans.

How many times must *ignore* public health experts listen *actual scientists* stay safe?

Get vaccinated. Wear mask live people vaccinated immunocompromised. Make N-95 tight seal, cloth mask. remember public health experts sense truth nuance.

Sorry basement comment. reason impression proponent vehement mask adherence even vaccination etc etc. Yes do. work ways. figured idk tell you. Wales smart omg likelihood catching Covid compared flu far, far greater 2x right now.

Masks social distancing moderately effective preventing spread Covid. data available we've learned incredibly effective preventing spread Influenza. 

The overall positivity rate influenza tests US season 0.2% ... cumulative positive results since Sept 2020 thousand. 

I would like emphasize low numbers are. Since Sept 2020 CDC received reports 2,097 positive influenza tests. 

If want compare risks two need use equivalent case numbers. lack real flu season right temporary measures enacted fight Covid largely irrelevant.

Flu cases among children would need greater half covid cases less harmful. actual number cases season far, far lower that. 

Wearing masks protecting yourself. effective preventing infecting person transmitting others. feel like I'm pedantic right now, asked right? stay masked forever? Right, lot places around world wear masks slow disease spread. radical all.

Certainly getting cold past 14 months blessing me? nice people coughing face, food, spitting talk, smell people's breaths. love mask wearing, tbh. I'm germaphobe, health anxiety whatever. like people gross. know someone try say younger demographics ones holding out, fifth populations risk virus vaccinated.

Here's table made restructuring data [this partially vaccinated	|	% fully vaccinated

That's enough me. actually believed couple weeks point vaccine news came out, listening politicians scientists. see masking hurts private sector all. think reducing capacity restrictions makes perfect sense, see harm requiring mask grocery store doctors' office waiting room two weeks. going hurt business.  trust issue trust never freely given. best, protect yourself, stay cautious, eventually, get back normal. Link said mention? I'm gonna take word here. Don‚Äôt engage troll That‚Äôs roughly one 4000. Pretty amazing stuff WOUSA? I'd heard rumours place exists. Apparently world also round!! Hahaha...  agree this. developed health anxiety pandemic actually got therapist help work through/cope fear getting vaccine, despite previous vaccine fears anti-vaxx beliefs, get flu shot etc. KNOW logical, reasonable fear, there. like irrational phobia like elevators, spiders, whatever. fear effect nervous system real even rational brain aware unfounded.

The two things activated health anxiety getting covid, getting covid vaccine (but everything health related became somewhat issue). Totally illogical, fortunately case treatable. think everyone access therapy known anxieties/phobias often manageable treated like mental illness. Oh no! Anyways....  New, deadly viral pathogen causing entire cities shut running healthcare systems around world causing millions die tens millions long-lasting symptoms destroy quality life. think people cautious running around licking door knobs like you? Dang. Cool cool thanks update! Looks like getting events take least year get back normal. Check r/target they're talking there!

Then check r/whoosh in: Skydivers likely people die skydiving sure getting downvoted. I'm really sure harm telling people keep masking. Hell everyone already used it. Keep masks months case. shows complete lack empathy employees, many young vaccine recently made available them. Target giving N95s protect fucked spreading bullshit vaccine make really sick. majority won't. Almost half people get feel nothing. like 49% every get sore arm. Next symptoms day so, fever chills maybe nausea like feel think getting sick. bad gone next day.

We lied throughout pandemic lie this? simply said people minimal side effects, know like bullshit spread covid itself, let parrots spread sub rest. Congrats, made exact kind doomsday argument referring original post.

You coming fanatical doomsday scenarios try scare people wearing masks stupid. replied another comment, think quite same. Personal freedom circumscribed potential hurt others. best knew last year - anyone vaccinated - activities brought risk. guy continuing mask hurts precisely nobody. sound like even give sources, wouldn‚Äôt believe it. 

How Fauci mentioning it? enough you? wearing masks trust people.  Leave em car man you‚Äôre terrified. Thinking mask extreme bizarre behavior see  they're trying say we'll never get 70-85% vaccination rate required herd immunity 35% people refuse get vaccinated.   Since wearing mask considered extreme? Lmao  Employees always poor mechanism enforcing mask mandates, ways recognizing saying don‚Äôt get conflict customers.

Do guys still signs saying masks required take down?

They would opening risk told employees didn‚Äôt wear mask despite local laws.  right, like said, parents make sure kids stay healthy vaccine becomes available them.

I view society's responsibility make sure kids get COVID, view parent's responsibility. like view immunocompromised people responsible making sure get COVID. feel you. wife suffers anxiety pandemic hasn‚Äôt exactly... ‚Äúhelpful...‚Äù

We‚Äôre fully vaxxed up. Texas relaxing measures minute we‚Äôve following store requests happily. 
We went nursery plants within last week actively conversation masks. don‚Äôt we? said needed. weren‚Äôt signs up. said slowly start getting used wearing them. She‚Äôs home toddler majority time work ‚Äúout about‚Äù speak awhile. takes time ‚Äúpop covid bubble mentality.‚Äù that‚Äôs possible vaccine 

I‚Äôll still wear crowded grocery store awhile... feels normal still big disparities among counties--in particular, rural counties struggling get vaccinated, importantly key age brackets (65+ 50-64) decrease hospitalizations due covid.

it fucking sucks communities divided. I‚Äôm still going west mine. think I‚Äôll continue anyway, feel secure it. I‚Äôm also kind germaphobe, overly, I‚Äôm horrible sick person, nobody family sick last year. Yeah, drug feet little bit. people gone home anyway earlier week. costly building owner improve air quality.  part ""the rest vaccine resistance come them"" understand? give decent examples want it. fully vaccinated month continue wear mask I'm kids. think fair mask see without one. imagine lot parents feel way too.

I say, I'll mask I'm sick going forward. seems like right thing do. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs trusting science, it‚Äôs trusting professional scientists took easy see factors account‚Äù

You get job CDC man, could learn you. don‚Äôt think considered many people fully vaccinated. get kids flu vaccine. covid yet, plus long-term risks fully known yet. Yea vaccines out, case studies showing open back up. 

I think real skepticism case studies on. (Southern, mostly Republican states) much consider though. Even data, people going interpret differently. people know enough interpret it, care data support want hear.

I personally think CDC established clear metrics guidance. Something like:

""The safest plan public health continue mask social distance. CDC going recommend end social distancing least 50% country vaccinated, number new Covid cases drops 5 new cases per 100k people. end mask mandates least 70% country vaccinated number new Covid cases drops 1 new case per 100k."" fact already see variants shows reasonable assume happen virus continues circulate dangerous flu individual level, kid flu, dangerous covid would kid. However, pandemic covid cases high likely child catch covid flu. looks like underneath mask monster haunting abandoned theme park Scooby Doo post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Hmmmm...

________________________________

Again updated data yesterday corrections NH data wrong.


7 day overall ticked little 18+ ticked down. There‚Äôs already ton precedent. Asia people wearing masks regular thing normal times especially crowded places like trains, malls, etc. amplified flu allergy seasons. It‚Äôs courteous.

Now there‚Äôs precedent US people won‚Äôt think I‚Äôm bank robber, I‚Äôm wearing mask forever. Bonus points blocking facial recognition.  Yes. exactly like cherry picking stats information ignoring science personally believe in. CDC said safe vaccinated people stop wearing masks. different someone trust science CDC said wearing masks?

And cherry picked stat regarding ""true end pandemic""...the CDC said pandemic over, safe fully vaccinated people drop mask. one without other.  Yep, basically to. cares I'm sure happen. Oh... Wait... Texas Florida lifted mandates cases went down. Maybe maybe breathing bacteria good thing. seem pretty short sighted regard. seems like cases jump maybe high risk populations much higher rate vaccination lower risk ones it'll bad? point unless younger 15 gotta say think vaccinated choice person making. Hard feel type way easy get vaccinated. Maybe light fire vaccine hesitant's ass get vaccinated asap. people anti vaxx anti mask sympathy anyways. i‚Äôm glad agree! I'm sure (rather rude) response addressed instead CDC. I'm epidemiologist, I'm quoting public health authorities. 

It worth mentioning serious long-term impacts influenza, one example google ""long-term impacts influenza"" find lots more.

and two, least heart concerned, seems evidence long-term impacts COVID: know big concern early pandemic, there's good news front least.  kid masks anywhere go. I. working fully vaxd still mask period time. point stands never eradicated never sought eradicate either, evolved background virus longer big problem. Gyms, too. Oh ok! I'll take club thanks. People without kids care kids. ""bypass vaccines."" Nothing 100% effective.  know, weird think right understand reaction irrational, time hate see people wearing almost nothing. dose 80%-90% effective two weeks.

The studies map.

The highest one I've seen CDC one. CDC's study showing 80% single-dose efficacy tiny - 4k participants (and young-ish healthcare workers).

The UK Israel ran much larger studies (24k UK one, huge 1.2M Israeli one.) **The UK found 72% efficacy three weeks first dose; Israel found 66%.**

UK study: study: study Sweden 45%:** one showing Pfizer vaccine efficacy 52% first dose 95% second dose, paper shows**

Some symptomatic test negative case control design, results ‚â•70s age group Pfizer/BioNTech AstraZeneca vaccines shown Figure 1. Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, odds ratio starts decline 10 13 days vaccination, **reaching 0.42 (95%CI 0.35-0.51) 28 days vaccination, equivalent vaccine effectiveness 58%.** AstraZeneca vaccine decline begins 14 20 days vaccination reaches odds ratio 0.44 (95%CI 0.35 0.57) **from 28 35 0.42 (95%CI 0.28 0.62) 35 days vaccination equivalent vaccine effectiveness 58%.**

For hospitalization rates rates around 15% unvaccinated individuals populations. Among first dose least 14 days previously, hospitalization rates 9% received Pfizer vaccine 8% received AstraZeneneca. Yay that's me!

 [Works hospital, commutes mass transit]

 ...oh. strong suspicion messaging. people talking ""why get vaccinated still mask socially distance"", CDC trying broadcast loudly vaccines mean get back pre-COVID normal.

I'm still masking, trust others trust 95% (played many TTRPG's, rolled many badly timed 1's). back unnecessary things like small grocery trips peak times, eating out, going gym mask on. agree premature, reckless risky. never enforced begin with. Either store. can't get vaccine. carry enough viral load show symptoms, enough viral load shed others. 

Do source this? thought asymptomatic transmission established science. Yea that‚Äôs opinion right now, long everyone feels comfortable sage decisions, open things deal corner Georgia. I'm perfectly comfortable wearing masks given lagging vaccination rates high community spread.  I‚Äôm typing wearing mask. isn‚Äôt me. acceptable level risk makes sense impose inconvenient regulations. It‚Äôs zero. claiming ever going zero risk anyone? Since used cars example allow everyone drive car regardless license, use seatbelts? take precautions minimize risk even can‚Äôt entirely get rid it. said best. personal freedom arguments really pissing said personal actions chance affect many, many people. starts occurring, think whole instead singular. I'm edit. work healthcare environment anything similar, suspended without pay get vaccine. working already endangered people refusing take vaccine keep safe? I'm pretty sure goes every possible ethic someone field sworn uphold. Yes, parent this. hard justify putting baby risk nonessential things. People throw 0.003% chance dying parents dying potential risk kids contract covid. People say well RSV way dangerous kid covid so...but currently millions active RSV cases everywhere turn. risk different. 

Fingers crossed September vaccinations. Mine still 2, hopefully babies included September estimates. propose American chose leave America foreign country receive dose foreign country others country.

So America, barely exported doses, immediately dispatch doses countries condition goes Americans. sounds like good plan.

Nobody forced leave. Make mind. great parents would sue someone helped you. wont help health issue betrayed take care yourself. 

Both things cannot true situations. sure getting hammered, that's reasonable. CDC says plain English vaccine 100% effective, 1,359 known ""hospitalized dead"" breakthrough cases zero. 
 &amp;nbsp; 
That said, vaccines *very* effective. Going current understanding, I'm personally worried rare serious breakthrough case. I'm give someone else grief wearing mask, though. Youre hero. I'm anti-masker covid-denier think people go way far kids thing. Kinda cringe tbh think got whooshed (rather clever) pun could try Googling ""[state] governor mask mandate"" - governor made order ending mask mandate show up. might also search specific municipality/city well. really don‚Äôt care people getting covid they‚Äôre going take care themselves.

You should, every infection another chance virus mutate. That's replicate. every mutation another chance morph variant current vaccines effective against.

That's vaccines personal choice. sake public health viruses need actively worked (by entire community - whole world case), passively allowed exist personally fine. already mandatory vaccines many things. pandemic killed millions left untold others worse state due long COVID. given effectiveness safety existing vaccines, earth make mandatory returning back normal life?  Even smaller odds getting covid? Seems like great thing get putting mask like 5min shop. I'll keep wearing mine people vaccinated country. (Plus autoimmune disorder theres bonus points) thing herd immunity likely unachievable point, we're likely covid circulating like seasonal flu. goal moment reduce risk covid extent risk level risks take everyday like driving, swimming ocean, seasonal flu. covid reaches level risk (which seems hit point vaccines), halting life (which shown huge costs education businesses) seems unreasonable every passing day. might've tad bit soon (I expecting around 50%) wearing masks first place likely people lie say vaccinated Again, ignoring statistics. state, deaths, cases, hospitalizations continue drop rapidly. Ignore science statistics ignorant regardless ‚Äúdirection‚Äù ignoring it.  Flu dangerous kids covid. Flu pretty much eradicated right lockdowns mask wearing collectively whole around world. costs nothing little wear it. want keep even understanding low risk hell cares? teaching family live fear ? need tell dr. getting license likely room dr. keep sheltered info. would let aug school even though kill 3 years wouldnt now? huge disconnect exploit whereever health. 

Also ‚Äòsue‚Äô cares? money. lawyer would take case courts would throw out. thing zero risk everyone. Covid19 risks young children small, smaller car accidents. ever allow child car? think is. point care enough human life make mandatory? half people fucking assholes actually willing take basic safety measures protect fellow persons, I'd agree need to. turned political pissing match, conspiracy theories abound, done. Across world, millions dead need be. even death, long COVID real thing lot people even mild cases. vaccines incredibly effective incredibly safe, make people take it. Coworker India died. got email last night. curious studies handy link - control factors like demographic, school resources, familial wealth, location, etc.? wonder air filter simply correlation factors played larger role higher test scores. Absolutely true ...I indian people get half blame situation however vaccinated, risk hospitalization death drop near zero. I'm boat, get second Saturday I'll continue mask 14 days up. But, view anyone without mask threat MINE on. 14 days past mask goes away unless required business may need something Governor Northam lifted mask mandate fully-vaccinated individuals last Friday end distancing capacity restrictions May may apply municipalities within state might want also search city's mandate. Unfortunately, thats true. country Greece, curfew early 6PM (!!!) completely restricted movement. curfew ineffective virus, makes exiting house crime. going mention extreme violence abuse police lockdown, insane. felt like living police state seeing many cops outside giving people fines exiting house.  may also get higher efficacy flu vaccines future. Shutting businesses would way much, high vax rate, optional mask wearing better sick leave/working home could go long way blunting flu season know it. worth argue people even kids. identify vaccinated person good mean ‚Äúthat kind response ‚Äú ?  Nobody calling lockdowns. Masks lockdowns. Good know. Thanks choice

I wonder states laws books prohibiting non religious face coverings public handle things going forward? Beyond rare side effects, AstraZeneca ineffective B.1.351 variant South Africa. imagine countries options avoid it.

[Study Everything opening 100% capacity mask mandate rescinded exception public transportation. wear mask stop silly person. comparing cars mean anything. also, no, know risk children low currently new strains arising - know right? I'm bioinformatics scientist studying disease heavily past year, btw. long term effects children worth risking wear mask, literally downside. children, though, unvaccinated people general generating new strains finish line. Well yes, stats true even presence flu vaccine. 60%+ children get flu vaccine every year STILL hospitalization deaths seasonal influenza COVID children (again, CDC). part flu vaccine typically much less effective COVID vaccines - years low 20% (see here: much reason think long-term impacts children worse long-term impacts influenza either  - certainly people take recover COVID, also people serious post-viral syndrome influenza. sources think otherwise please refer - seen yet. 

There definitely going children die long-term effects COVID - trying minimize that. scientific reason seen yet think numbers higher almost every year seasonal influenza, sense risk children parent informed accordingly. aren't. Oh wow! he's fine 14.9 million people dying long get mildly inconvenienced? target ""Choosing get vaccinated cause people die."" actually untrue. Asymptomatic spread pure myth. carry enough viral load show symptoms, enough viral load shed others. core, scientifically proven fact type virus. top that, vaccinated virus, coming contact someone unvaccinated virus cause catch it. Unless course, vaccine work. assuming does, fair say concerned catching virus, choice get vaccine yourself. fair everyone. Unvaccinated people potential catch virus spread UNvaccinated people only. one kid (or something similar). fun. Healthcare going force issue US vaccines get EUA. facilities going require staff get Covid vaccine fully approved. should. going liability issue well staffing issue corporations hospitals. time lawyers help greater good.

That's going good day - alone could add 3-5mm vaccinations ledger every percentage point counts.  kids get flu shot. See difference?  Visiting weekend. What's full go? Coming Florida one cares (dont worry I'm vaccinated mask compliant) variant dominant across world UK variant. UK variant occurred overall death total would far lower, India may seen spike cases led Indian variants. Given variants massively accelerated death rate UK, unreasonable cautious new variants seem far transmissible UK variant. SA variant transmission advantage, unsurprisingly spread slowly UK. transmissible variant cause damage evasive, less transmissible variant. Quit pretending give shit science obviously one people that's bitching mask mandates global pandemic. Ah yes Mr. Bongwater, make mistake, I'll update comment. educated engineer, claim medical background surely do. claiming medical professional, take medical advice guy internet. commenting article linked to. Also, record, hate children. even couple. And, admittedly, used one.

After re-reading link posted still think bit contradictory information. examples ""the majority children develop symptoms infected coronavirus, symptoms mild."" """"children ... asymptomatic covid-19 experiencing long-term effects"", ""More recently, study children 5 months 4 years old nurseries France shown low levels infection transmission covid-19""

The study linked mention children 18, show pretty well accepted trend decreasing symptoms/danger decreasing age.

On second read through, paper actually inconsistent, simply showing data inconsistent study needed. even acknowledges ""We certainly enough data long-term impacts covid children make good policy decisions right now"" common generic manufacturer Mylan. making expensive EpiPen people rich. Hello doctor! Thank much this. family mixed getting COVID-19 vaccine, especially cause mom‚Äôs history blood clots. 

She almost died years ago blood clots gained surgery gallbladder removed. thankfully recovered, risk getting blood clots making concerned past medical issue come back receives vaccination.

Do think would still okay get vaccine, would medical history come back haunt receive it?  Doubt it. See Israel vax rates vs. covid rates. match narrative? Agree. Ridiculous analogy. like thinks falling hurt \*other\* people like spreading communicable disease can. guys alright hospitals overwhelmed lot positive cases, someone Dallas Morning News Texas Monthly would it. 

I‚Äôm sure sort reporting anomaly, Texas fine. fools argument. percentage population cannot get vaccine small worth focusing on, yet keep hearing it. people still mask up. make legislative policy group probably less 5% population Good point. Still, think CDC believes there‚Äôs enough immunity drop masks. They‚Äôre aware people going break rules stop masking unvaxxed. anyone know Virginia‚Äôs policy There's hard evidence *need* yearly vaccination. Antibody levels may less time, there's difference excellent protection phenomenal protection. Also, we're entire positive antibody count alone indicator protection, Cells could play important role long term protection. idea test within meaningful populations prevent widespread panic ill-effects false positives. would overwhelm medical response system divert precious resources wrong places. 

I think one ideas sound convincing theory stand practical experience. countries lot testing, one's seen false positives causing panic straining medical system. simple matter testing couple times verify, false negative, everyone goes back doing. big deal. Travel another state allows kids. Lots states allowing 12+. nothing uncivil post. bad robot automad, bad! Well, actually think humans *are* antisocial. We're pretty well evolved social.

That's extremely low risk death. I'd take chances  spread misinformation. speak absolutes

Can quote absolute? customer I'm wearing black mask another year. first time I've went year without common cold love feeling cozy black mask. plus, yeah people might walking around virus..... 

Shout employees retail stores might forced masks need show ""smile"" customers. Yes mandate extended couple weeks ago Sept 13th.

Reaching endemic stage alongside flu failure, although disappointing considering potential vaccines. Yes. is. Full stop. Ôøº Oh going makers anti-maskers using point validation...loudly... 

Meanwhile us either wear wear post covid give shit. Yep. Frankly give damn others lives. wanna double mask, wear googles, face shield go it. wanna go maskless unvaccinated, recommend it, that's choice. Good luck choose latter, gonna need it. make money this? seems like affect much 70% 65+ population fully vaccinated ~85% least one dose. group makes bulk hospitalizations deaths.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* that's it.. Everyone vaccine fine. People get vaccinated (willingly) dont wear mask.. well that's problem get sick. anyone Germany want weigh in, sounds good outsider, obviously may logistically problems Yes, constantly getting sick was, ironically, something looked forward discussed daycare. Nothing like strong immune system! every sniffle family holding breath till get call urgent care test negative :/ definitely rough time parent aged kid. I'm sure kid going look back days grateful parent willing sacrifice much them. yeah, I'm actually one took 10+ years schooling study achieve it.  even advised CDC pandemics/bioterrorism 2008, though implement much pointed lacking.. simply typed job pretending I'm actually scientist - typical reddit someone accept information live state capital Walmart, target, kroger stores enforce mask wearing. 

I work one top grocery stores state people came without masks time.

Boy covid mask story covid mask story past year. 

It's definitely rural thing. 

Now I've vaccinated month I'm going wear damn mask anymore.  that's joke I'm Christian believe God.

It's belief God kept safe past year helped scientists experts develop vaccine. got soon available thanked God it. 

These people irresponsible embarrassing share similar title them. family friends incredibly frustrating trying reason them. experience always people voted Trump last US presidential elections.

Don't idiot like people mentioned article. Also judge people certain religion based idiots. Dude idk lot people socialized past year depression rates lot higher. People scared meet people... Even people fully vaccinated scared meeting fully vaccinated people. strange people way. I've socializing friends year I'm fine couple days cause weather something sucked. Like let's say raining ton snowing ton. past would met friends inside meet outside can't cause rain snow depression snowy areas I'm guessing. gonna better cause weather getting better people still scared. I'm parents still scared go inside without masks stuff.  Yup sudden anti maskers LOVE CDC, think CDC omniscient. allowed question great CDC, even though care CDC recent announcement. People subreddit know better SAGE UK saying apparently. That's completely false. Coronavirus far pathogenic. risk covid far greater. myth needs die. Stop spreading bullshit. still immunocompromised unable get shot bound suffer well people's poor decision getting vaccinated? that's actually population level immunity / herd immunity would work actually escape vaccines. virus would essentially longer endemic enough continue mutating spreading actually hit target Yes did, least Michigan everywhere I've gone Read post again, slowly. can't help dont underatand logical arguments incorrectly employing, even definitions provided, think *opinions* matter scientific context. Youre clueless. love tone went argumentative dismissive realized arguments arent valid actually know talking about. address *opinion*, actually many times dismissed idea CDC right. Im really sorry reading comprehension low scienticic capacity :( big relief!

The problem CDC extremely qualified people staff track scientific evidence CDC (or whatever health body use) made recommendation Mr. Turst seems making. Covid killed nearly 300 times number children flu since pandemic began. that's think I'm fucking terrified we've listening whole time. people vaccinated yet never gave two shots masks. fair, tests per case (positivity rate) low outbreak, catching pretty much everyone covid. excuse lack testing general - IMHO, would fairly inexpensive make sure everyone finishing quarantine (instead migrant workers) got tested.

I've following Taiwan's response since pandemic started, said elsewhere policy largely symptomatic testing only. That's right disease like covid. anyone saying population ""compliant"" system perfect model whatever read recent reports: cases moved around suddenly turning clinic symptoms. seek medical care potential symptoms actually get tested days later, necessarily self-isolating.

Don't get wrong, Taiwan far comparatively outstanding rest world. virus find way, way, get through. That's does. found weakness (air crews centralized quarantine leaks, like happened NZ/AU) spread. Same's going Singapore Hong Kong now.

I confidence three places soon control covid situations, they've done great far. Fingers crossed. went today half employees weren‚Äôt wearing masks. 99% customers though. quarantine worried store talking risk individual. I'm talking risk society. reason countries go lockdown protect health service. health service overwhelmed cases, shut down. there‚Äôs point masks take eat drink. need find way make vaccinations attractive people Texas. Maybe let shoot something. Even CDC doesn‚Äôt trust CDC make judgment. said it‚Äôs local leaders. would take Target first place? That's completely irresponsible thing global pandemic. shopping done one person household preferably contactless pickup already offered Target. always been? always been? Oh agree. mean, isn‚Äôt seasonal ~now~ thought meant. agree we‚Äôll end mutated strains stick around break shall see! Ah yes last day would able see classmates. thinks he's invincible. 


Then tell \*think\*! do, get changed soon well. fucking birds. always ruining everything important run tell think course pandemic far worldwide. don‚Äôt think anyone disputing that.

However, things definitely close highly vaccinated countries like US UK. saw masks last time there, flu season.

I'm sure I'm expected know though, plan mask flu season. I'm asking months wearing mask, whether skip super spreader events? stores need offer curbside Returns people fully avoid going inside. Always  Thanks AMA. understand doctor/pt relationship answer, provided, medical advice buttttt 
 
how would patient thinks (untreated) blood clot COVID bring provider? likelihood blood clot large enough cause symptoms (SoB, chest pain), time, small enough resolve 2 weeks?  Everyone mentioned ""the kids"", ignores immuno-compromised adults would actually much likely suffer/die able vaccinate. that? You‚Äôre clearly unwilling unable answer question. don‚Äôt want discussion, want argue. good day lol, nothing like smell retail fine afternoon!  don‚Äôt need others form opinion you. think it? 99% didn‚Äôt wear masks even patient front unless oncology, surgery messing patient‚Äôs airway. least around here. point ever stop wearing mask? always going safer everyone wore mask. 2 different points think ‚Äúsafe enough‚Äù Actually, you‚Äôre confused. U.S. GIFTING 80 million doses. EU gifted tiny fraction that. Allowing Pfizer export fulfill contracts gift.

The U.S. allowing Pfizer export *and* gifting. effect far greater anything EU done. going eradicate virus current vaccines. good enough. Similarly, never get required uptake. ensure cases spike, reimpose restrictions necessary. Experts believe future, pandemic over. virus going go extinct. CDC: Vaccinated people stop wearing masks, unvaccinated people still should

Idiots: one wear masks anymore!

/r/coronavirus: CDC bad messaging. Thanks, TL:DR, so, thanks :)  Target near person standing door make sure wearing mask enter. masks, follow science :) Whatever, clearly care. Thank  Kids days love speedruns Cross-reaction mean anything effective stop virus. would want would neutralization, specific. Mutations inside SARS-CoV-2 still cause disease sufficient mess neutralization reduce immune / vaccine efficacy. think people bring kids keep forgetting fundamentals comes spreading virus. cant spread unless close contact people. I, average adult, spread virus kids contact day day life? People keep forgetting much world isolated age groups. push get vaccine nursing homes. 

Under 16 account 25% population. Babies infants never away parents make 7% percent population. That's 18% population. sure mean ok. decisions allow people make. CDC done.

Most states open vaccines everyone early mid-April. Conceivably means would take weeks get people started. takes 6 weeks get fully vaccinated. 

Prior CDCs announcement bet we'd see guidance like around 6 weeks May 1. June 15th exactly that. Joe Biden's 4th July target seemed like marketable thing too.

The CDC confirmed new studies we've already known. need update guidance suddenly. know safe vaccinated maskless understand changing guidance means practically. Anyone who's lived America last year knows *the first people rip masks* anti-vaxxers lie say they've vaccinated. There's danger still. Smaller danger people can't get vaccinated, children, immunocompromised people, etc. Illegal, no, least U.S. certain businesses like banks used surely point future go back saying ""no masks"". safety issue them. Actually, whole situation interesting far businesses concerned security. much security camera catches someone lifting something whatever mask on. LOL! enjoy service visit NJ, especially freezing out. yeah, nanny state right. Pretty surprised population jumped latest census. respect choice 100 though disagree that. appreciate picking least something. also say failure offer definitive advice use definitive metrics, makes sense scientific research analysis, it‚Äôs sort danger used public policy. give people endpoint see fatigue defiance set in. hard data would guess one reasons ohios comparative success early pandemic hard reopen date, inverse true formerly well controlled countries like Chile Germany struggling moment know what, I‚Äôm willing bet seeing friend‚Äôs parents grandparents dying virus psychologically damaging stuck home.

I knew kids got covid terrified. One even gave father ended passing away.

There lot reasons kids want protected virus, saying likely fine ignoring that. majority get time spent lockdown, getting effects covid easy. science say I‚Äôm allowed wear mask tho? Well, full crap beginning said ""stop buying masks, masks help might hurt, wash hands"". eventually relented became impossible maintain position. vaccines work like magic clearly greater good.

the side greater good lesser evil. 

there people not/cannot vaccinated, imho better opt-in opt-out. bureaucracy hates opt-out make life miserable anyone trying so. Everyone gets vaccinated gonna exposed. That‚Äôs given. Whether you‚Äôre one still get sick within ability control. Transmissibility affects *when* find out. I'm absolutely redditors above. Refusing vaccinated lot like drunk driving. wearing helmets seatbelts endangers person making choice financial burden health care system accepted enforced. enforcing vaccinations? US donating AstraZeneca doses stockpiled. Every one them. applies KN95 buy authentic, almost [two thirds KN95 masks US birthday Memorial Day weekend too. great gift year. Kinda opposite last year everything started slowly open right birthday. feels great, doesn‚Äôt it? didn‚Äôt see friends family entire year. we‚Äôre vaxxed. went lunch friend yesterday didn‚Äôt feel anxiety all. It‚Äôs liberating feeling. don‚Äôt care others want continue wearing masks, felt great letting guard bit finally. Read comments, I'm allowed get it. Oh Maginot Line response. fighting COVID-19, therefore virus could deadly mutations? fact medical resources focused Covid-19, it‚Äôs mutations likely identified addressed. Boosters mutations could developed months. Multiple different types vaccines use COVID-19.
It‚Äôs don‚Äôt watch likely kill you. Many people carry benign viruses. know won‚Äôt mutate become deadly? Oh no, shut even mention covid vaccine. keep saying can't get I'm 18, get they'll kick house. also say I'm killing vaccine.  free need permission. set appointment go. Really understand context ok child it. vaccinated 100% guarantee protection infection. Yeah sure, vaccinated people definitely protected non, variants unmasked, think risk increased everyone.
Feel free send downvotes 123.... Sure, Amemerica. allow people make decisions themselves. 

We dont outlaw smoking, drinking, obesity yet likely kill end. hope people get vaccinate choose to, choice. Well US production Emergent, hopefully fusion AstraZeneca Janssen vaccines. think premature due low understanding variants. Singapore preliminary testing, many infected working zone airport received flights high-risk countries, including South Asia. Several tested positive B.1.617 variant first detected India, World Health Organization said might contagious versions coronavirus.e Friday. health officials said 28 airport workers became infected, 19 fully vaccinated either Pfizer Moderna vaccines, two approved use Singapore. airport outbreak began 88-year-old member airport cleaning crew fully vaccinated tested positive virus May 5. Co-workers became infected later visited airport food court, transmitted virus customers, officials 

With new CDC ruling there's really going back people, despite happens. really can't say completely scientifically motivated. Japanese do? Flu shot FDA approved. understanding employer can‚Äôt require COVID vax it‚Äôs also FDA approved. then, yes would enforceable.

But reality guess comes many refuse. 50% workforce refuses field you‚Äôre already short staffed, can‚Äôt fire half workforce without anyone replace them. prediction: cases going increase unvaccinated people infecting number breakthrough infections fully vaccinated people whatever reason don‚Äôt mount sufficient immune response.

Can explain expect happen states dropping mask mandates, happen states like Texas North Dakota dropped mask mandates 2 months ago, vaccination levels lower now? guess companies trying avoid confrontation angry customers using CDC guidelines last week reason longer wear mask store. 

I really wish CDC made statements clear stated masks still needed indoor public areas. Every parent know take kids errands pissed. CDC gave free pass anyone reckless want one know difference. Vaccines work work well.

If younger 50 fully vaccinated chances dying due COVID close zero  Weird article title directly it.

""Pfizer planning apply Food Drug Administration September emergency authorization vaccine children aged 2 11. Moderna also¬†conducting clinical trials¬†in small kids vaccine. FDA already approved vaccinating 12 older."" air really something else

The fresh air inside Target? Gross. They're even close other; part effect somebody's diet maybe going tiny contribution costs like taxes society level. Allowing possibly expose others covid something reasonable chance directly causing somebody's death near future; like drunk driving scenario, illegal.

Also, idea saying services would deserved someone else ridiculous. We're really going try check people's moral worth determine treated? Honestly think weighed everyone's good bad qualities determine ""deserved"" treated would actually make cut. Milk Sponge done vaccinating. 

Eventually, virus mutate become transmissible nothing less 90% vaccine compliance slow vast majority places cannot realistically hope achieve degree vaccination. 

You can‚Äôt stay lockdown indefinitely, illogical stay lockdown keep pace virus‚Äô transmissibility face widely available vaccines virus gonna beat you, full stop. also wonder politicians wanted end ASAFP try subdue fighting amongst many general public. theory less conflict stores between, well, everyone. vaccine last year. Also, wonder many 375K deaths children 12. they're great otherwise, might able argue them. Good luck!  mean employers require vaccines then? haven‚Äôt noticed vaccinated people getting COVID. Mask usage indoors continue till herd immunity. Outdoors required festivals arenas. helps business like one work tried hard keep everyone safe last year. Ending mask mandate vaccinated employees gives pretty good carrot stick hesitant. It‚Äôs also easy reward employees nationwide able ditch masks work want. It‚Äôs one thing wear mask 30 minutes store another wear everyday work 8 hours. Interesting take... really sure implies ok... know something interesting planes air recirculated, goes HEPA filters filter viral particles. problem could still easily breathing neighbor‚Äôs air. I‚Äôd curious impact air nozzle pointed would - essentially blasted ‚Äúclean‚Äù air, mimicking outdoor wind greatly disperses viral particles. also wonder planes could retrofit powerful air nozzles, increase outflow ventilation. could create ‚Äúair barriers‚Äù around passenger, I‚Äôd imagine could go far reducing viral transmission planes, also major vector global virus transmission. 

Of course, still issues leaving seat, waiting line plane, proximity airports security lines, etc. maybe it‚Äôs worth it, hard say. citing options person has. decide direction go. 

That said, prevented possibly life-saving vaccine worldwide pandemic plainly child endangerment. Imagine kid denied vaccine coming COVID dying health problems rest life.. would say ""at least listened parents?""  Oh man! Congrats completing exactly guidelines change benefit! not. transmission means vaccinated people get COVID. vaccinated people get COVID, vaccinated people get severe symptoms hospitalised. vaccines mean COVID spread required fill hospitals, enough COVID spread, hospitals still filled up. risk individual low, but, enough spread, risk society high. Wow. months plan mask up? plan still attend super spreader events flu season like weddings stuff? bad historic record devolving whatever extra power took.

Experts? kind experts, science religion sars cov 2 novel virus. Crazy, know.  Also expert, since personally know 2 people already lie vaccinated don‚Äôt wear Mask, people probably lie dont. vaccine 99.992% affective death hospitilizaiton. extra .0001% added makes differnece everyone critical. 

 
Leeza Osipenko, senior lecturer practice department health policy London School Economics, said vaccine backing. academic led U.K.‚Äôs National Institute Health Care Excellence (NICE) scientific advice 2014 2018.

 
She taken Russian shot recently tested immune response, ""which showed high antibodies.""

 
""Same results everyone know ‚Äî immediate friends family,"" added. ""Sputnik excellent vaccine serious side effects associated administration.""

 
She points ""very negative anti-Russian climate world, damaging rollout,"" citing vaccine's difficulties Czech Republic ‚Äî diplomatic incident thrown relationships Russia disarray ‚Äî case point. incivility whatsoever, hell!? I‚Äôm assuming CDC might saying ‚Äúnow you‚Äôll know someone personally suffered...so get vaccinated‚Äù...because way this. know certain couple openly express fact lie vaccinated. also believe earth flat, so... Keep masking social distancing clear kids vaccines. CDC ban prevention measures, dropped mandate vaccinated people. still care. You‚Äôre effectively protected 2 weeks first. second dose booster. expotential power currently 0.42. covid still goes without masks. study showing masks change R0 done vaccines. vaccianted person wearing mask isnt likelky transmit covid. normal things wearing mask. 

Yes. could also technically wear high heels normal things wear thong. Nothing wearing mask diminishes experience things listed above. 

Bullshit. forced wear high heels thong would extremely uncomfortable diminish experience. wear mask similarly uncomfortable diminishes experience. I've already putting many recreational things without mask uncomfortable. please stop spreading shit. Maybe half people gym vaccinated. agree antisocial behavior, give people time. last 14 months lot. may take weeks feel comfortable. couple days restrictions dropped larger scale. 

I problem shaming others, okay. I'm fully vaccinated feel guilty going without mask now. I'm okay wearing make point try feel superior.

I question ""there's people can't get vaccine "" narrative. Sure, there's some, highly doubt significant number. 1% 1%    opportunity Americans band together greater good nation it‚Äôs GUARANTEED fuck up.  comment automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  We. Want. Updates.  feel better wearing mask, that's fine me. know people claiming wearing mask going science.

The covid vaccine may protect covid diseases like masks provide protection.  news water wet Since put long chastising people safe it? Like wait till absolutely kills 50 percent people get force them? 

Ignoring double negative...you stop. 

Consider audience. People going pull Tucker going listen anyone telling anything ""trump won"". changing minds may causing opposite effect. know person face face, maybe think respectful discussion, lecturing strangers Internet annoying gets blocked (I blocked many people question.

That answer. 

Side note: lecturing mask wearing made snort laugh...like, can't mask already masked around people. keep giggling neighbors going surprised learn handlebar mustache over. 

Anyhoo...it's birthday, put !ask go pick pizza beer dinner back deck. great night! Hah.. may efficient giving vaccinations they're terrible data reporting. data weird long time icing cake. 

I'm surprised CDC released data clearly wrong (it would literally mean 97% eligible population - INCLUDING 12-15 - received first dose.. impossible). must B-team working Sundays. :) problem. Fuck anti vaxxers. Let die.

&amp;#x200B;

See? get live lives anti vaxxers get dose Darwin. Win-win sure lying Colorado shits joke.

If concerned worried , wear mask get vaccine.

If aren‚Äôt don‚Äôt live life want.

If vaccine effective (but yet proven SAFE long term) fuck hard lmao. risk ones monitoring go protect themselves. 99 percent people would fine kick couple days especially vaccine available. worried get vaccine stay masked times continue take precautions time being. continue masking socially distancing. avoid large groups. Rare fact here. people testing daily see covid not. I'm certain false positives false negatives time... would see people tested every single day, kind money afford daily testing? time go wait line daily get tested? Plus mild symptoms issue, studies already demonstrated people worst covid lack certain vitimins vitimin D. life sure dangerous aint it? wear masks don‚Äôt want get vaccinated. CDC dropping mandate equate ban masks. would Danny DeVito say? dumb anyways vaccines 100% even die still spread people.

I feel like they're going walk back later, people get mad getting hopes up. regular American citizen adopted Ukraine, fucking trust government ALL!! Individualism WAY!!!! way! Liar. love ‚Äúfollow science‚Äù people ignore bits science. personally think they‚Äôve dropped mask requirement get fence sitters get vaccine. can‚Äôt count number idiots gotten vaccine don‚Äôt feel like would anything. They‚Äôd still wear mask what‚Äôs point?

The idea things go back normal get vaccine sell lot people. course you‚Äôll still anti mask idiots there‚Äôs hope them. mean, though? science says 50% enough, better 38%? making anxious also think I‚Äôve become entrenched pandemic life need time adjust back  vaccinated wore to. I'm gonna argue random retail workers wait staff it. knowing I'm protected I'm safe infecting others means absolutely masking unless business requires it. sure that? People wearing masks outdoors/in public going viewed unvaccinated? earth would anyone else still wear mask Saw joke, probably hear Reddit‚Ä¶ tell vaccinated not? ask election. dumbest people Earth. didn‚Äôt change policy. reported new scientific evidence factually.

Should hidden fact vaccinated people protected don‚Äôt spread virus? thing is, people chose get vaccine likely already wearing masks (and likely continue so)

No, there's quite lot us fine putting masks needed, gung-ho getting vaccinated, desperate stop wearing masks longer needed.  need experts state obvious.  feel like people wearing masks seen also people gotten vaccine dude shaking booties wear mask anytime heart desires. pretend following science essentially punted left local state authorities. You‚Äôre misinterpreting they‚Äôre saying.

Like, true slightest. left *policies* local state authorities. CDC guidance science based. government Hawaii wants keep mask mandates even situations CDC said masks required, that's fine! make *policy* decisions following science? Nope. pretend are. Water wet. History says lie. find theather now. enter restaurant, wear mask 30 seconds get seated, stay maskless hour wear another 30 secs leave. mind, go eventually. cancer patients immunocompromised safe get shot. live virus cant hurt  told everyone *who vaccinated* stop wearing masks, lines guy said. 

Your statement literally true, tell ""everyone"" stop wearing masks. Actually want whatever want, also want tell others do. Duh. would businesses agree something turns away vast amount customers? Especially restaurants need money get. Science - yes. Human nature - no.  Lie die. Well shit. even try passports large events, like ball games, see far gets us. think they're perfect, limits, think lot people rushed discard idea quickly. Im expert, one lie ;) Yeah. jumped gun. waited untl mid-Summer IMO. Weird - one go requires masks even machine. Maybe different ones different rules. guess we'll see go week. LMAO, uneducated fool That's untrue. Younger people still dying (albeit high rate) main issue long term illness. ton people still covid related issues year getting it, that's old, sick, obese. - point armchair virologists fully vaccinated still wearing masks think they‚Äôre danger dumb anti maskers think aren‚Äôt - takes uneducated opinions based entirely personal beliefs support everyone's freedom keep wearing masks even vaccinated! also support everyone's freedom wear mask vaccinated (as per CDC recommendations)!  Also almost two year old couldn‚Äôt agree more. Also, mine daycare class doesn‚Äôt mask (less 2), that‚Äôs likely vector. Far unmasked unvaccinated person grocery store.   I'm fully vaccinated I'm never dropping mask fully. Spring fall terrible allergies, winter comfy warm. might drop summer. science saying you‚Äôre risk? saying vaccines aren‚Äôt effective enough? doubt it. 

If read actual guidance, CDC says it‚Äôs fine decide mask settings. essentially punted left local state authorities. You‚Äôre misinterpreting they‚Äôre saying. 

Choosing wear mask anti-science. Obviously risk high enough crowded situations warrant CDC recommend masks. It‚Äôs definitely clear cut think you‚Äôre ridiculous ‚Äúanti-science‚Äù nonsense. feel like better plan rather flip switch state's privately owned businesses scrambling determine they'll do. think underestimating efficient people New Hampshire distributing vaccines! course I‚Äôm going lie! least proud stupid. already international form vaccine passport used places yellow fever epidemic. also used smallpox still thing, used US. Time SK Gov discuss Leronlimab production Samsung. See: That's fair j&amp;j one took 5 minutes readily available. True got vax care. anti vax people really care. Anybody care go get shot care like rest us.. antisocial. considerate behaviour. make slightly uncomfortable benefit people around them. matter? Yeah unfortunate youre right guess anyone basic common sense expertüò≠ Glancing post history it‚Äôs clear you‚Äôre coming good faith. 

You also obviously don‚Äôt understand ‚Äúthe science‚Äù, epidemiology, nuance. stupid monkeys ""Unmasking"" implies wearing one begin with.   Came say this. Lol. Good one. OK great, get stupid vaccine. people lie, government, hospitals Yep, feels like government officials surprised announcement well. CDC could said govt officials ‚Äòwe‚Äôre making changes recommendations. day/week come plan make work everyone represent.‚Äô vaccines near 100% efficacy severe COVID. get ‚Äúfucked it‚Äù vaccinated 2 weeks past second dose one dose Johnson Johnson. You‚Äôre saying things aren‚Äôt based reality. unter age 1000 yes. older folks not. humans also made certain age, thats another story.

Are suggesting every person died c absolutely healthy? NZ nearly people vaccinated can't imagine would top mind! guidance aren‚Äôt vaccinated, continue wearing mask. children would wearing masks Aye keep spamming emojis demonstrating know vaccines antibodies work fucking roaster Nobody talking obese people, obesity kill people. Covid spreaders go around killing maiming people, hat concerned peopl talking them. Sounds like either ill fitting mask, one made bad material. least 6 months, possibly long 2-3 years. point get booster shot.

&amp;#x200B;

So shot works, would need mask? CDC making science based policy recommendations. Whether local governments decide follow recommendations them. However, policy odds science based recommendations is, quite simply, science denial. Go ahead doubt efficacy vaccines, really care. still denying science though even though want pretend not. didn‚Äôt die COVID! died *with* COVID...  identify vaccinated person. lying.  love going ""honor system"" good chunk US spent last 14 months mental breakdown small piece fabric ""infringed rights"" claiming whole thing fake.

This thing gonna mutate cause people lie getting vaccine make vaccine useless. say ""well vaccine never worked first place. That's didnt get it"". 

I'm sick living parody version country. considered keeping 8 year old situations might prolonged close contact unmasked, unvaccinated adult? world could go back normal could shit Sherlock. I'm vaccinated believe natural selection. someone wants get sick that's problem Why? That‚Äôs totally line expected efficacy figures vaccines E484K/E484Q binding receptor mutation variants. trust assholes last year change. live state people wore masks (properly, even). said, friend move certain major city beginning pandemic avoiding public areas people wearing masks (just year ago around pandemic reached first peak). agree, totally fair, think closing schools less COVID posed significant threat children limit exposure vector kids spread around take home spread vulnerable people. aunt cancer patient got vaccine. know several immunocompromised people got vaccine. people recommended get vaccine. Mutations yield vaccines ineffective unlikely. factoids simply true. suppose we‚Äôll let natural selection thing. People actively lying vaccination going shoot foot vaccinated crowd isn‚Äôt gonna bother try stop them. Since official means verifying vaccination status, allowing vaccinated people go without masks effectively letting everyone go without them. honor system work. did, pandemic gotten bad first place. Luckily practically zero chance infant could suffer negative effects disease. Today went mega-vax site Oregon Convention Center 2nd dose Pfizer. Three weeks ago, place busy, got pretty quickly. Today lines insane. Maybe 100 times people? Lots 12-16 year olds accepting walk-ins. Right, many people process. don‚Äôt understand. I‚Äôm one people decided ostracize. It‚Äôs funny guys pretend tolerant ones though. year, know death outcome covid.

Are children still dying covid? Yes. anything everywhere go parents potential risk them?

We waited able get still hospitalizes children, strain families medical system. Seems fair import then? üòâI agree everybody lying right big stinky butt holes one  Vaccinated people safe without masks. science actually says. suggesting every COVID death victim's lifestyle?  It‚Äôs like would able tell they‚Äôre lying. HIPAA regulations would prevent employers asking employees say haven‚Äôt vaccinated. course people lie. That‚Äôs nothing really new Yes finally someone gets it. Murder legalized right?  Water wet   Right fully vaccinated there‚Äôs less concern false negative symptoms. would‚Äôve gotten PCR test like sure wouldn‚Äôt stressing possibility false negative like would‚Äôve pre vaccine Water wet. News 11. not? many vaccines state kids get one. Makes think.  know Scrooge changing outlook life role model look to, right?  CDC finds fire burns breaking new study Youre completely right.

Unqualified shitty parents 99%. Aside major developmental imbalances child taught one (yes one) temper tantrum handled correctly never happen again. argument doesn‚Äôt really make sense spend 20 seconds think it.

It really doesn‚Äôt matter. COVID going infect hundreds millions gets control, mostly outside US. variants find way inside US like latest Indian ones. likely reruns old mutations slightly different configs, we‚Äôve already many infections worst variant able do, take bit symptomatic protection efficacy.

But even they‚Äôre not, biggest variant threat pure statistical probability, going foreign. US terms domestic policy likely irrelevant. blessing curse. employees get vaccine it‚Äôs free. Curbside pickup cost extra wanna part help protect can't vaccinated yet like young &amp; immuno-compromised.

I know odds transmission low now, even lower mask up. I'm one worst places world vaccine adoption &amp; overall pandemic handling, every little bit could save life. I'm patriot &amp; feel duty super tiny thing. earliest everyone state could vaccinated tomorrow. Luckily fatality rate children practically zero serious cases exceptionally rare. Much like concerns touch transmission think people heard first part never updated science updating masks recommendation time‚Ä¶ saying vaccinated people don‚Äôt need mask indoor gatherings, even visit unvaccinated people maskless. don‚Äôt need wear masks outside. really masks needed outside anyone‚Ä¶ wouldn‚Äôt say complete surprise it‚Äôs coming many weeks‚Ä¶ Humm, Humans vaccinated continue wear masks.

The others wear masks catch hoax! yes and? responsible it, me. Sheesh virus longer threat was. 

Why hold virus longer problem, least US, different standard risk society. 

Anyone get vaccine. It‚Äôs risk many things. Stop moving goal posts scared. 

If you‚Äôre irrationally scared, hide basement  Rapid tests 50% false negative rate, really PCR used know whether not. wear mask? like year? wtf difference fully vaccinated folks nothing worry about. Times anti-vaxxers though, it‚Äôs guaranteed they‚Äôll get sick variants come through. children high risk? spread aren‚Äôt ones dying getting severely ill. 9 states haven‚Äôt reported child deaths covid, zero. state 3 child deaths despite nearly 600k cases. got response ‚Äúso know better CDC?‚Äù ...They aren‚Äôt perfect. honestly dont believe done away age scaling. kept 60s, 50s, 40s, etc. older people STILL havent shots. Universities companies given doses primary care offices. Even new administration well developed plan.  turned fine course people lie. seen videos people freaking willing physically hurt someone informing need wearing mask?!?!. Plus heard bit covid series podcast kill (lol) vaccine relatively easy modify Bingo. this. entire argument timeline everyone wants vaccinated vaccinated. That‚Äôs shown week two. Yes, and? American way living + selfish people wearing masks getting vaccinated = death. could saved lives matter lifestyle people took simple measures. Guess what? matter though. People want vaccine won't. course they‚Äôll lie. people still don‚Äôt get mass shooting made nearly year half still dont understand masks work. increased risk factor. live area masks never enforced. stay home fully vaccinated, receive necessary in-person medical care regular basis enter professional buildings mask optional common areas medical waiting rooms unmasked children (children hardly ever wore masks here). doctor said KF94 N95 (or greater) masks form eye protection (prescription glasses adequate) sufficient. that's year able get vaccinated. Came say thing. Breaking news..? continue wear mask people stupid get vaccine? Happy cake day people obsessed death rate? Why, rants, seem like you‚Äôve completely avoided examining aspect virus pandemic? yet US fewer restrictions thirty times amount cases 25% fewer adults vaccinated. also order others murder people street. That's totally massive authoritarian move right? I'm import I'm sure they'll lie Lol American cases start go too. guys good run. F. You‚Äôre right, bad Well, look brightside, shitty coworkers. seen thousand different explanations ‚Äú95% effective‚Äù means every mask/vaccine discussion it‚Äôs frustrating funny say that:that's exactly rich feel poor paying taxes pay none 99.99% subsidize .01%‚Äôs personal responsibility

hey, amazing felt way Healthcare too?

like, point aspirational rich people would actually want act like rich people helping poor health get Healthcare too?

sounds like good reason wear mask get vaccinated, right :-) TIL I‚Äôm expert matter? want risk virus it. Vaccinated protection enough me. can't live fear whole life people want get vaccinated. certain point need get back normal. Honestly vaccinated people scared people lying masks, probably bother getting cae caries way risk. get sure. almost always find study fit narrative unless you‚Äôre completely way base. understand sure fully vaccinated person ok traveling France w record need record negative test? ask St. Bartholomey's still requires neg test fully vaccinated travelers. effect, US said ""it's okay everyone stop wearing masks."" idea anyone public health role would say anything remotely like this, especially spent year trying get everyone wear mask.


We wore mask mitigate spread Covid. vaccines readily available reflects current level cases, hospitalizations, deaths. day could stop wearing mask going come eventually, unless wanted wait 12s approved (which think fair viewpoint), availability vaccines may well get now.  point don‚Äôt really care. I‚Äôm vaccinated. I‚Äôm safe. choose to, that‚Äôs them. suffer consequences, guess. literally giving excuse need wear mask... absolutely idiotic experts people mean experts also lie, lying one is? Honestly really need fire chief CDC. 2nd time screw Americans again. Last year told us need wear masks effective. they're telling us need wear one indoor public places long vaccinated without considering children individuals can't get vaccinated trust Americans put mask they're vaccinated. joke! CDC read news live America?! first complained wearing (still definitely wore it) I‚Äôve kind gotten use I‚Äôve loved fact haven‚Äôt caught cold felt ill year mention allergies haven‚Äôt acted either city tree sperm friggin place! Even though I‚Äôm fully vaccinated I‚Äôll probably still wear mine often reasons stated above. really need explain, year pandemic, masks provide protection others user? literally exact logic anti-maskers use say ""If wearing mask, need wear one?"" number first doses administered yesterday‚Äôs update 1.3 million, I‚Äôm mistaken, highest weeks.  parent get sitter every grocery trip, etc, that's lot pain people whining want go bar unmasked. part? sounds like another exception me. event, even around 50 years, can‚Äôt say happen 51. simply objective reason suspect Covid vaccines cause secret long term side effects. Further, vaccines...many around 50+ years ever done so. side effects don‚Äôt present 2 months, don‚Äôt happen.

And said (above?) really think vaccines risky, that‚Äôs choice obligation continue wearing mask public. Going guess teen get till now. brother went mexico wedding, found got covid trying get back states, instead quarantining, paid cabbie bring hospital would give negative test result. Cost $100 USD  think reasoning sound. However, still think main objective CDC ought limiting transmission virus, rather maximizing happiness. 

We still don‚Äôt know long term effects even mild infection. collective obligation disincentivize (rather encourage) risky behaviors endanger self others (i.e. harsh penalties DWI)

The new mask guidance almost cost little tangible benefit. kids  Americans humans general. Hah. RELIGION! Except people can‚Äôt vaccinated lol even meaning you‚Äôre 12 can‚Äôt get it. 65 autoimmune disease can‚Äôt get it, 15 autoimmune disease can‚Äôt get it. Nice. dog dead 4 years even knows people lie. 

Duh. Whatever effective... kind go opposite road.  

It‚Äôs true character limp pandemic ignorant 30% everything could prolong spouting platitudes letting nature run course really thing saved us throwing copious amounts money vaccines bribe people take. (Side note: remember letting nature run course = Spanish flu lasted 4-5 years significant deaths ceased thing) anyone actually really reading sub rather less me? I‚Äôm excited every time see new restriction lifted. Im Dr. House. Everyone Lies. Yup. I've cautious past life death difference. people danger unvaccinated individuals. Dr. Rochelle Wolensky said best, ""If vaccinated, protected."" science clear, vaccines highly effective preventing symptomatic asymptomatic infections. Covid-denier goes maskless unvaccinated people risk people like them. vaccine widespread U.S point, 87% Americans eligible 90% Americans living within five miles vaccination site. Listen, fully vaccinated person wants keep wearing mask problem that. But, restrictions can't last forever. trust science one think right call make. Might well ask people wearing mask, thats people read question. I'm expert common sense say vaccine works well hell care else not?? VACCINE PROTECTED, BITCHING ANYONE ELSE DOES? 

Common sense says shut hell mind business üëåüá∫üá≤ getting bronchitis sinusitis 5+ times year (asthma sucks!) last several years. 2020? single day sick. takeaway: people gross; wish mask wearing polarizing thing. need normalize wearing masks appropriate showing work ill, coughing sneezing bodily fluids place. Ok that's close 50%....

And vaccination rates still steady. knew going drop point still vaccinating lot people every day. 

The main problem locked first place overwhelm hospitals prevent deaths. point hospitals overwhelmed wanna believe that, feel free to. delusion harming others. I've people lie whole pandemic recieved vaccine know! 12 cases zero deaths UK today show need another 6 years lockdown!  fact said mutates rapidly *fucking HIV* shows little know you‚Äôre talking about. course care. Everyone care truth.

Hope nothing best. read that, isn‚Äôt unknown possibility? there'll still New Hampshirites (considerably less states) say still mask mandate ""it's soon"". Nah. Walmart target across street one another. Target ends bit expensive don‚Äôt mind paying avoid fucking weird people end walmart. It‚Äôs night day difference Duh? Trumpicans freedom vaccinated, wear mask, distance others. 

Since case, ""God speed you, good people, meeting orange maker much sooner expected!""  businesses supposed verify vaccination? mask requirement protects employees much customers employees may vaccinated reasons choice. thinking literally way enforce people vaccination cards times.... might shit show Duh. I‚Äôm expert people die. Yes, Japan‚Äôs government much better time. People always lying. family members lying it, telling Honestly, whenever hear insane utterly stupid shit uttered healthcare professional, usually nurse. say said profession healthcare, reject statement. Idk nursing attracts allows graduate craziest people, something does. Certainly need expert reach conclusion.  birthday party another kid. Showing without kid would fairly big social faux pas.

While correct everything said, issue, especially areas people refusing vaccine relatively high, going reaching herd immunity, people actively lie status get around wearing mask. 

The societal burden equitable, consequences socially economically move forward. 

Is unvaccinated family going give covid unvaccibated grandmother holiday season? certainly wear mask anywhere quarantine get covid test coming visit. 

When long haulers suffering long term effects hit 65, going forego Medicare treatment Covid related issues rest taxpaying America going pick tab choice get vaccinated? 

It goes beyond family. goes friends, coworkers, economic affects entire country affect family potentially years. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Oddly seems young kids don‚Äôt seem get nearly much spread nearly much. I‚Äôm MI kids person learning many months now. high school constantly go virtual outbreaks. 5/6 7/8 buildings gone virtual once.

3 weeks later got covid. 2 days 101 temp back normal.

Thats annecdotal obviously hella impressed. still say person fleeced 20 times that? funny..... logic, never mask mandate, people wear N95

What think N95 is? Next news headlines: ""COVID outbreaks time highs among unvaccinated Americans""  hate anti-maskers for? listen experts thought knew better.

There's hell lot people suddenly know better experts one. Agreed. Masks phased out. known advance mask mandates would end, dropped twelve dry cleaners last week. 

You appear indicating masks effective Taiwan Japan even thought countries high rate wearing masks.

Country | Cases per 1M population | Deaths per 1M population
---|---:|--:
Taiwan | 71 | 0.5
Japan | 5,375 | 91
USA | 101,335 | page saw said used 120% doses they've issued. I'm going data error too. see saying seems petty vengeful getting yelled forgetting put mask walking dog, outside (I been). ‚Äúlook them‚Äù won‚Äôt say anything affects zero ways. Dead bodies least it,  CDC announcement cited several studies published last two weeks. may evidence suspected vaccinated low risk transmitting recent studies seen CDC confirmation real hard data. people jobs. PA pretty close 70%(68.8%) first dose, probably going reach 70% second dose aka mask mandate fully lifted. Good thing got card times. Trust I‚Äôm expert. Liars gonna lie. Reddit interwebs. That...is do. fact people unwilling cases got control. Like anything else, masks tool cure.

Masks, social distancing vaccines tools use various benefits different situations. vaccine doesn‚Äôt good someone doesn‚Äôt use it, mask useful someone covid wearing vs someone who‚Äôs vaccinated. 

No one thing end pandemic, it‚Äôs matter using tool best ability reduce spread possible. Obviously every person vaccinated everyone wear n95 day long virus would gone 2 weeks. that‚Äôs exactly practical smoking, earth 2021 years old. /s Yes, pointing two people get vaccinated day one received mRNA vaccine received J&amp;J, day 15 J&amp;J person considered ‚Äúfully vaccinated,‚Äù mRNA person actually better protected. point, we‚Äôre asking people get damn shot. shut everything down.  Like young children. Coool Water wet? Jezus. undertaking active steps make child's life miserable, miniscule risks. Oh really? takes expert say that??! I‚Äôm comment don‚Äôt like  I'm saying know sure like using antibiotics bad immune system, might reasonable assume less interact germs less resistant become overall. diff hpv? office starting monday. We're much smaller though, everyone got vaccinated except one, shes vocal (she doesnt want ""chemicals"" body, asked ones, didnt know any). Boss even offered us $250 bucks EVERYONE got vaccinated. think hes trying pull drill instructor thing. 5 17 total people found may 14th indian variant symptomatic least partially vaccinated. That's ominous. can‚Äôt believe elites world conspired unprecedented scale covert ways world never seen get people put piece cloth face Yeah, good luck that. said CDC ""made critical error surprising basically everyone significant change.""¬†He added days announcement made, spoke senior leaders CDC told indoor masking would probably last thing lifted ""it effective hard situations ‚Äî put mask PA hits 70% adults fully vaccinated, leaves people 18 (until 12-15 year-olds cleared get Pfizer vaccine get added well), people can't get vaccine (not sure % population would be), course choose get vaccine.

I guess question is, bad consequences public at-large getting vaccine masking mix full reopening? hospitals still slammed, simply enough people get infected cause that? Oh well, brilliant advice along, guess whole pandemic pointless! logic, never mask mandate, people wear N95 social distance!  Vaccine IDs won‚Äôt buy us much. make things worse. Anti vaxxers flock businesses don‚Äôt check vaccine IDs, increase spread Covid. Vinay Prasad talked ZDoggMD‚Äôs podcast.  Cutting edge info literally plan last administration. Fantastic news  one get sick die, think bad refusing wear one there's raging pandemic. However, change point wearing mask everywhere sick scared virus 95% protected anti-social behavior, humans, social animals, discourage anti-social behavior. I'm saying send cops anything, looked upon behavior discouraged antisocial? Yes opinion. Right, 28 states got rid mask mandate decline covid daily new cases deaths. science settled- masks make difference point everyone wants shot get one 99% old sick vaccinated. Vaccine effectiveness least 97% symptomatic COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, severe critical hospitalizations, deaths. Furthermore, analysis found vaccine effectiveness 94% asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections. outcomes, vaccine effectiveness measured two weeks second seconding POV. wasn‚Äôt telling get yourself. I‚Äôm sorry comment construed meaning. risk complications healthy children higher flu compared COVID-19. However, infants children underlying medical conditions increased risk flu COVID-19.

From CDC.

I get fear parents kids, willing let life roll normally flu around, ok lower risk COVID them. There's something wrong New Hampshire's numbers. they're true, they've used *more* available doses. J&amp;J shot takes build immunity. Immunity still increasing 56 days J&amp;J injection. expert, agree people lie.

(The statement lie. it) 2019/20 Flu Numbers

The final data flu season 2019/2020 released by¬†the CDC¬†in April as¬†COVID-19¬†continued spread throughout United States.
Between October 1, 2019 April 4, 2020, flu resulted in:

39 56 million illnesses

410,000 740,000 hospitalizations

24,000 62,000 deaths

195 pediatric deaths

We #s current period really accurate discuss number flu deaths yet. want remind everyone Moderna Pfizer fuckin shit. companies kick ass saving lives. 

I know half want single payer healthcare half want government involvement actually prefer Obamacare system now. couple adjustments think system envy world 

Half private half public eyes working. talking about? Children masked adults interact dont spread among adults via children. part hard understand? goal never protecting children didn‚Äôt need protecting; they‚Äôre serious risk developing Covid 19 symptoms. risk parent Covid 19, gives kid, kid spreads another kid, kid spreads parent. Since can‚Äôt ask kids mask around family, makes sense ask kids mask around kids. 

Stop creating strawman arguments needing protect children Covid 19. New hampshire posted insane numbers today else do? Forcing people provide ""vaccine ID"" kind going slipperly slope giving various rights. 

I'm vaccinated fully certain places start telling show vaccine card, I'll turn around leave. visited Walmart, Kroger‚Äôs, Home Depot, Old Navy, Planet Fitness today without mask. Loved it. 

Not vaxxed either. Freedom baby! know can't isolate another month two let rest people get back normal vaccines. seems like pretty small sacrifice considering already avoiding indoor dining, bars, grocery pickup vulnerable. Ironic refuse wear mask anti-vax area got vaccine. Hard different grouped same. father sick cancer right now. rough. sorry go that. numbers close statiscally. quote rate stats, what's comparative % here? Oh right 65%. Minor ""difference"".

Also notably, anyone wearing masks 2019? 2020? F dishonesty. Hide numbers is. lie. true all. Shocking parents understand dangerous covid kids too.


Evidence first study long covid children suggests half children aged 6 16 years old contract virus least one symptom lasting 120 days, 42.6 per cent impaired symptoms daily activities. interim results based periodic assessments 129 children Italy diagnosed covid-19 March November 2020 Gemelli University Hospital Rome (medRxiv, doi.org/fv9t).

However, becoming¬†increasingly apparent large number children symptomatic asymptomatic covid-19 experiencing long-term effects, many months initial yeah, lots people said this. i'll mention her. Either way point immune compromised state issue majority people. Cdc recommends getting rid mask using old data enough people vaccinated. guarantee nothing changed months time. I'll back back comment up. like cdc saying okay toss mask. 


If people like well still wear mask. It‚Äôs chicken egg problem. Businesses trying gauge policy please customers. CDC: ‚ÄúAntibodies coming way, one way another!‚Äù  time unsub sub think. Brain dead obvious posts like waste pixels screen. look pretty different next month, right time. Death rates falling still thousands per week. Many people still getting vaccinated per day.

So wait one month? decide that? opinion better CDC? course that. Fauci lied us specifically get us ge wants. cdc misleads us well. think approach terrible. Darwin take wheel. Medial system bankrupt survive incubated. fucks give anti maskers/antivaccers..... cause alarm, cause concern.

India melting pot point, virus thriving.

The last thing want someone bring back version virus able spread even vaccinations.

We're great, that's reason completely ignore risks, otherwise could end go lock-down again.  Frankly, pandemic enforcement mechanism compatible American sense ""freedom"" would allowing people shoot anyone wearing mask sight. People would learn quickly happened. says effectiveness vaccine dangerous kids. Honestly surprised business want vaccine passport system. give fuck anti maskers endanger employees customers, want money wallet cuz let come inside spend money store go somewhere else greedier let's in. Shit like think corporate greed ruining america. keeping wearing mask, CDC didn‚Äôt say stop wearing it, you‚Äôre vaccinated least sunscreen approved kid infant great n95... two year old, maybe.

Source flu comment? Genuinely looking wrap head around bit no. studies studies last weeks confirmed trend : data healthcare operators (vaccinated) reports data Belarus Israel involving variants well. 100% fact reported taking also account normal deviation due nature data acquisition itself

cases cases ""outfit"" LOL

the vaccinated (simply put) get give it. rare cases reduced infections possible load small vaccine-educated immune system take care it. spread outside body, spread INSIDE body. cases already rare resulting symptoms mild symptoms vaccine-educated immune system works wins.

In words : started sort ""help"" immune system fight ended perfect vaccine, never seen before. protects even exposure spread others. 

a 

perfect

win one‚Äôs done single thing wrong wearing mask vaccinated. Calling dumb embarrassing exaggeration. 

Some immunocompromised relatives don‚Äôt want put greater risk. avoid disparaged employees shop. Hell, half time wear mine troll conspiracy shitters. drives wall. Fuck ‚Äòem. hope get virus, won‚Äôt me. 

Moreover, would care take precaution regard unnecessary? Delete Facebook Problem kids, people can‚Äôt get vaccine ones don‚Äôt develop proper response. 

As bonus: idiots also create new variant escape vaccines...  They're trying to?  15-day figure probably comes paper hardly scientific consensus, results strongly suggestive. See figure 3.

I still prefer err side caution (after all, I'm technically ""partially vaccinated"" another week), hard deny vaccines work work quickly. saying responsible parents allow public, massless unvaccinated people walking around? grocery store? Playing kids? stay cooped up?  CDC Morbidity Mortality Weekly Report, current influenza vaccine 45% effective overall 2019-2020 seasonal influenza B viruses. Specifically, flu vaccine 50% effective influenza B/Victoria viruses 37% effective influenza A(H1N1)pdm09.

So flu shot 45% efficacy enough rest concerns disease much likely harm child need absolute protection different disease less threat?

I little hopes changing minds days come see difference way risks viewed. *quite* true, actually decently close. flu deaths people 18 deaths 18 total: 287


For perspective, approximately 100 kids killed year bike crashes: we're looking statistics, let's honest show numbers, yeah? Really ever cut hair mask little hairs get caught? gotten caught long appointment able take drink water water another room wear mask day every day? gotten sweat mustache hot blow dries mask day? nothing like shirt unless face stomach like guy Arnold movie Mars.  Natural selection sort things out.  Likely Thank you. appreciate speaking fucking truth. Though driving much better analogy hit someone someone hit you. So, life risking others around (people car, people cars around you, people bikes, people walking, etc.).  Part problem right think it‚Äôs even possible refer living Chinese government normal you‚Äôre used terms freedoms US, need look it‚Äôs like live there. give government kind power, aren‚Äôt quick return back ‚Äúnormalcy‚Äù I've warned user regarding trolling. However, please stop feeding them. Cheers though. Others went up, others went down. One northern states getting hit pretty hard around time. low levels, think we'd lower still kept masks weeks. get us past Easter even. Actually completely true. I'm bed I'll provide source morning. I'm speaking children only. epidemiologist idiot unless suggesting transitioning system people prove vaccinated drop masks. honor system good enough.  Think long took us get used seeing people masks, probably take bit us get used seeing people without. know sometimes I‚Äôll watch tv brief ‚Äúwhere‚Äôs mask?‚Äù Moment it‚Äôs become norm 12+ months. You‚Äôll mentally switch back within months research this? hoping find information this. Requiring masks lockdown. It‚Äôs possible Covid, may Flu another illness. girlfriend it, able get Covid test easily. Demand tests quite low moment (at least US).  Forcing people take vaccines end horribly. It‚Äôll make people anti vax come ways avoid it, it‚Äôll result less support government.  I'm beginning think might Dr. Fauci's point. Spare melodramatics. easy breathe masking work requires masks believe science.  Stop trolling others. someone asks stop, stop. warning recieve.   Yep. pay extra smoker, pay extra anti-vax idiot. problem enforcement. Waiting 1 months would mean people indeed vaccinated. think it‚Äôs bit early mean kitchens luxury restaurants least half kitchen staff either drugs functioning alcoholics.  Source?  anyone worked pubic five minutes pandemic knows EVERYONE lying vaccinated take masks culture masking causes employers force us keep working masks another year. Let vaccinated unmask.   Overall he‚Äôs nice guy fucked views lot things involving covid. Lol. Vaccinated people care. yes, sure. hopefully works way No, aren‚Äôt. Hence CDC dropping mask guidance rest us. Source? science say shouldn‚Äôt allowed wear mask? harm done simply choosing wear one? also vaccinate kids flu. kids vaccinated covid, treat like flu vaccinated against. and? I'm fully vaccinated wear mask 8 hours day office. There's lady work immunocompromised child can't get vaccinated. I'll keep wearing it.  cares whether people lie. you‚Äôre vaccinated there‚Äôs 0.01% chance you‚Äôll get virus can‚Äôt argue you‚Äôre scared non-vaccinated people would get sick. people lie vaccinated, it‚Äôs personal choice end day given groups harmed virus vaccine readily available months now, matter? example, someone youthful prime 20-30s I‚Äôve seen statistics death rate age group. go gym almost daily FL never caught virus. Therefore plan taking vaccine. Give reason given anybody risk virus vaccine readily available virus clearly personal effect myself. see incentive get vaccinated in, get ‚Äúprize‚Äù getting vaccine. perspective actually makes sense. point send vaccine refusing infected back home get natural treatment. actually like 1 100,000 that... 

if go individual kids dam near vast majority systematic. kids high risk heavily shape immune issues.... 


most flue shots guess types around next season account strains... know better CDC?

Just follow science, hard :) even remotely factually true, bullshit made justify acting like shit. I‚Äôm completely this.

I know two people died covid last couple weeks. One 63 years old 28. 63 year old middle vaccination process, im sure one.

I know people eager get back normal, definitely aren‚Äôt well past everyone single eligible adult getting vaccine. various reasons, many still process now. hard follow science.  news, water wet. girlfriends kinky. likes biting scratching. There's zero evidence happening significant enough numbers change calculus. Well, yeah?  waiting even longer first dose. Oh give shit 

My next door neighbor. mom nurse got whole family moderna shots. 

Her oldest son, goes unmasked. get vaccine. spreads tons disinformation IG it. 

I argue maybe 3-4x week. I'm like dude talk mom.
Still nothing. told he's going die stupid reason. Reddit LOVED collectively telling people best pandemic shaming didn‚Äôt Let's look India mere months ago: claimed beaten virus. Yeah wonder, sure places like India spreading virus making tons mutations, presence handful vaccinated people vaccine resistant strain unlikely dominate.

Keeping steady level infections presence vaccinated people becomes likelier vaccine resistant strains start dominating. What..?  think might strategy live let die? people cannot get vaccinated (children) people vaccines ineffective (certain types autoimmune disorders cancers). Current guidance, coming across ‚Äúanyone get vaccine‚Äù, ignores completely. Wearing mask painful?? Children extremely low risk harm. Immunocompromised already compromised covid adopted safe practices like grocery delivery pandemic, continue practice. Cancer patients adopted lifestyle. Focusing groups main concern massless looking obstacles opinion, need accept risks. Who‚Äôs lives talking about. seems valid demographic you‚Äôre talking sort allergy physically cannot take vaccine, reality very, small percentage population. However, mention ‚Äúletting virus rip half population‚Äù seem forget half population essentially immune virus without vaccine. That‚Äôs odd 5 10 year old boy missed 5 weeks school last year due severe pneumonia. oxygen levels mid 70‚Äôs temps running 104. Longest stressful 5 weeks I‚Äôve ever lived. 

I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll disagree prove point very‚Ä¶. whatever odds read online. boss felt way children barely risk. Apparently sleepless nights hospital bills illusion. exited one month later. want delusional. Blissfully ignorant apply much self-deceiving there's often undercurrent loneliness and/or trauma. understand saying. often felt way myself, respectfully disagree... Hear out.

I'm saying tell cold hard truth, I'm saying think probably hard using thought process I've best seen described ""truth without context"". exactly lie, mind easily adopt warped version truth. Obviously, can't know what's mind, everything I'm saying based evolutionary psychology admittedly limited understanding way human brain works. 

All human beings thing thoughts, especially thinking future, start open minded many possible outcomes, eventually focus one two ""more likely"" outcomes meer possibility becomes truth mind. often causes people take chances likely focus negative like uncomfortable even short term discomfort leads improved overall quality life... practice, common thing people say ""I feel stuck"". feel stuck marriage, job hate, situation, state depression anxiety fear. becomes self-fulfilling prophecy sorts... fear failure, tend think negatively positively hate uncomfortable way easier decide can't something new different anything continue lives before... stay miserable situations, strange sounds people often choose familiar misery unfamiliar change could make lives better. like taking temporary discomfort short term even improve comfort long term. irony take temporary comfort short term knowing pay discomfort later... today's instant reward, faces buried screens day, never slow society live, brains evolved deal effectively takes extra effort. part reason people least try mimic way lived millennia exercise, diet, strong social groups, spending time outdoors, rest (both active passive rest), etc. much better mental health outcomes. 

All brains work like degree, friend. people able honest others obviously, I've found people say ""brutally honest"" often tell harshest version truth without context. Truth without context easily manipulated, constantly seeing politicians, media, etc. use advantage great success.

People run possible scenarios think head often focusing potential negative outcomes potential positive outcomes... slowly start believe one outcome likely eventually becomes ingrained reasonable option even there's much evidence support even good evidence support something contrary.

I said exact thing past necessarily lie. truth context... Often thoughts sufficient enough truth context potentials distortion truth within context life. something consider... Cold hard truth better delusion, maybe try telling real, compassionate truth. much better alternative, experience.  Yup. I've said coming weeks months ignore rare occriance vaccinated person needing hospitalized Covid, almost everyone winds hospital going unvaccinated person. hope happens, people pay attention. loved ones, friends, telling stories got sick. asked get vaccinated, answer no. Maybe convince others hesitant get vaccine. Jesus Christ, flu risk young child COVID. People waiting vaccines approved segment population barely needs go back lives. know hard understand. 

Covid Zero happening. Accepting much easier accepting later date wasted several months/years life. Hard define ‚Äúworse‚Äù. 

Our bodies hard time recognizing (asymptomatic) it‚Äôs first time humans ever encountered it. It‚Äôs like first contact smallpox modern medicine luckily deadly. 

That allows pretty aggressive spread high mortality rate (especially local healthcare system collapses) - see Greece, Italy, Spain mortality hit 9-15%. (Vs 90%+ First Nation smallpox)

The influenza virus highly, highly adaptive capable mutating beyond existing antibodies within 6 months. 

Flu vaccination development involves worldwide surveys ‚Äúwild‚Äù variants computer models predict short-term (~18 month) mutation directions. essentially get vaccination built best guesses. 

Meanwhile original COVID vaccines still ~98% strains didn‚Äôt exist developed. 

Impossible predict (we‚Äôre less 2 years unknown patient 0), long super-variant doesn‚Äôt show up, things looking rosy future.  don‚Äôt know they‚Äôre thinking they‚Äôre trying play ‚Äúgotcha‚Äù role making seem bad anti-vax science deniers. don‚Äôt understand purpose science relates policy-setting. Sucks them. Let's try distract issue unmasked unvaccinated people spreading Covid unchecked children vulnerable groups pointing every day dangers. 

My biggest concern exactly sensible person predict: anti-maskers using loosening restrictions lie get away continuing pandemic hell we've endured. difference uniform experience; people children high-risk people whose already-elevated terror levels got higher. 

I feel like we've reached herd immunity, b continue putting pressure everyone get vaccinated so. there's damned politics it, science math. whole world risk, errs side selfish see masked unmasked nose. state at? think California, masks still required June 15. Why? say ‚Äúha told so!‚Äù You‚Äôre loser. Right, thought /r/NoShitSherlock moment, too. What's slowdown vaccinations? They've saying they're going ramp two months... know several people pro mask vaccine. guess make choice fear most. guess keep wearing masks take vaccine. need ask immunologist testing titers. pandemic, it‚Äôs hard would explain anti-maskers people like needed wear masks. usually told stay home. taught middle school didn‚Äôt offer virtual-only position, question. work houses Yeah watch youtube video see I‚Äôm saying they‚Äôre heartless they‚Äôre ‚Äúcool it‚Äù people die can‚Äôt bothered wear masks months.

At point, accept (*i.e.*, cool it). Vaccinated people made choice, voluntarily unvaccinated people made theirs. wearing mask another couple months going noticeable effect unvaccinated. people choose get vaccinated end contracting Covid dying, that‚Äôs unfortunate, I‚Äôm also going lose sleep it. feel *any* moral blame remote chance continued wearing mask *could have* influenced anti-vaxxer possibly wear mask.

If there‚Äôs someone immuno-compromised vaccine ineffective them? Yeah, I‚Äôll feel sorry catch Covid, again, consider fault. Faulting vaccinated people wearing mask anymore, vaccine incredibly abundant available, people still spreading Covid people voluntarily unvaccinated, seems ridiculous me. It‚Äôs incredibly attenuated causal link.

At end day, we‚Äôve seen 500k+ Americans die Covid past year we‚Äôve suffered terribly. Now, we‚Äôre end safe highly effective vaccine it, really heartless say you‚Äôre ‚Äúcool it‚Äù people voluntarily choose forego vaccine spite everything we‚Äôve seen last year couple contract Covid die? We‚Äôre heartless, we‚Äôre numb. vaccinated people wearing mask isn‚Äôt going change that. You‚Äôre taking conversation shutdowns distancing. Nobody saying need shutdowns.

I didn‚Äôt mean imply talking shutdown, talking masking only. Masks easy.

Masks suck. Breaking news! Bears shit woods! Back Tom!  That's - got second shot today. Yes! Thank you. flu ‚Äúunmitigated‚Äù time flu vaccines exist? Even kids? 

That‚Äôs quite take. I‚Äôm confident saying President Americas history wouldve handled situation effectively 2020 Trump did. used pandemic catalyst ambitions instead convincing nation right thing. matter aren't/cannot/are waiting vaccinated. 

My partner getting second dose week that's cutting fucking close book, Wawa filled maskholes already taxes going? jfc. totally agree you. thought could wait u til least 10k cases USA, 5x amount. completely forgetting kids even pregnant women. Many, many OBs want women wait first trimester getting vaccinated. jury still getting vaccinated pregnant countries don‚Äôt advocate unless high risk. don‚Äôt understand going step 4 step 497 one leap. ...yet. Viruses mutate time alternative fully vaccinated people risk anyone need continue wearing masks performatively shame anti vacc wearing them?

Can plan? sounds like shit plan newborns children 2? young wear mask? people younger children handle mess early rollback masking except staying masked socially distanced indefinitely? CDC address that. Strawmen aren‚Äôt helpful here. surely you‚Äôre still comparing novel coronavirus endemic colds flus? Another story sky blue...nice. get vaccinated üôÑ Problem keep waiting, boss afford remain closed long. harm community would effect hired won‚Äôt business come back to. keep waiting make situation worse come back to. Couldn‚Äôt take vaccine fine around unvaccinated people?  Duh. would cruel unusual mandate vaccinated.

Somehow fell back sounding like paranoid anti-mask crowd. care.  3% figured live infectious disease covid, they‚Äôll continue afterwards.

Forcing vaccines isn‚Äôt really option adults, simply choose partake activities could warrant proof (flying, etc). could hope large companies requiring way schools universities kids, even then, antivaxx parents find ways around constantly.

What (as population) supposed then? Due certain people passing vaccine expect everyone mask rest lives small portion people‚Äôs immune systems drew shit end stick they‚Äôll forever risk?  I'm native Florida tell idiots abundant. person think CDC saying you‚Äôre train vaccine effective, you‚Äôre bar effective? CEO company also million years old entrenched idea thinks work culture be, so, yeah, seeing change. news, fish swim birds fly Thanks- something striking pediatric flu majority deaths unvaccinated children it‚Äôs quite preventable deaths year :( That's probably nobody said removing masks would reduce cases. made that's make sense. Maybe that's relatively black people Florida.

Solution: import black people Atlanta elsewhere. Per Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) used collect reports adverse events vaccination general public. primarily used identify potential topics investigate regards vaccine reactions. However, event data VAERS often verified often self-reported, assumed adverse events VAERS actually associated cause vaccines, possible estimate frequency adverse events data.

Large vaccine sites costing lot money operate. reached peak vaccine demand month ago. can't force everyone keep wearing masks never get vaccine.

I feel kids 12 though. People lying since beginning going lie vaccinated people care? won‚Äôt like chicken pox confers lifetime immunity (until shingles). like flu maybe slightly worse flu whole point masks disciplined society it. 

I fully vaccinated probably wear mask public better part rest year. far people need treat way, vaccinated not. 

It's dumb thing care much honestly. Survival fittest  Please, please let new *Dune*! I'm blaming them. wish people would take vaccines. 

My point still stands though. I'm fully vaccinated I'm going spend life wearing mask I'm risk anyone else signal unvaccinated people ought to. agree you‚Äôre saying I‚Äôm surprised people don‚Äôt see this. People would rather inconvenience masks save thousands lives everything end pandemic. would guessed Exactly, always edge cases can‚Äôt control that‚Äôs risk world takes every day. Nothing 100% driving work vaccines effectiveness , get close possible. end day mental health tax living distanced must balanced along physical well-being. awesome go extent kids deserve hope people society follow suit light pandemic. Additionally hope people knowingly symptoms flu season wear mask go out. learned society wash hands understanding germ theory, masking aerosol spread respiratory illnesses. Jesus Christ would‚Äôve never know /s agree, people want that's great support freedom also want keep mask thank health since get sick often regularly always wear scarf winter anyway cold air gives asthma attack masks great too. Also nonsmiling resting face enjoy deal Long term? eventually get COVID. There‚Äôs two options building herd immunity: easy way (vaccine) hard way (getting sick)  in... experts say sky blue Even flu shot effective enough prevent infection, still reduce severity. disgust you‚Äôre fucking ignorant asshole can‚Äôt admit proven wrong.

Also, masks primarily used protect infected spreading illness, protect people catching illness‚Ä¶I‚Äôd hoped regain confidence CDC Orange Potato‚Äôs reign ended decision killed hope. (Am fully vaccinated husband 16 year old.) Easy bud 

Little extreme, 99% survival rate Every person infected one bundle chances mutation. Mmmmkay Sure. Don‚Äôt forget include people staying home count people see. still don‚Äôt want kids get it, don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair get idiots refuse vax mask It‚Äôs lying, ration ppe, said unless front lines covid would probably okay without out, new info came availability ppe, updated thoughts, it‚Äôs science works don‚Äôt ‚Äúpersonal choice‚Äù thing you‚Äôre saying we‚Äôre pandemic talking thousands deaths. That‚Äôs masks mandated first place. need social pressure everyone masking get unvaccinated keep masks hope govt leaders keep mandates order save thousands lives. 

And it‚Äôs willfully unvaccinated suffer. It‚Äôs also cancer chemo patients, immuno compromised, kids can‚Äôt vaccinated. Letting virus rip half population good plan. would wise keep masks kids get vaccinated fall cases drop negligible then. Since contributing discussion, downvote you.

But, disagree.

I'd argue anti-mask tendencies driven propaganda efforts whether masks convenient. know propaganda efforts (I want get political, know I'm talking about), *don't* see people complaining masks inconvenient, least nearly much, countries propaganda disseminated. let get down. slanted here. Air hard breathe water Yep. friend tell need 2 week national lockdown right now. want crazy shit, well CDC even recognize B.1.617 variant concern tracking all. Even VOC. hoped admin change would improve things debacle past year, really know think perhaps nothing yet changed. ever forget CDC's early testing fiasco last Feb-March. absolutely unbelievable pure incompetence.  Sort deaths- it‚Äôs fine. Cases massively underreported many countries. Deaths less (although India exception right now). ""the people can't get vaccinated""? whole premise making everyone get vaccinated, right? Otherwise care anybody anti vaxxer anti masker vaccine completely prevents covid? Realize can't helicopter parent want well adjusted kids. still cause long term damage kids problem. want kid lung scarring? Flu that. 

I've never worried dying virus. masked distanced relatively healthy. long term damage even mild asymptomatic cases terrifying however. Look studies SARS. pretty. flu sucks nice getting sick fall winter once. Following lockdown, single recorded pediatric flu death US. timeframe 200 pediatric COVID-19 deaths. flu higher IFR COVID-19 children, coronavirus much infectious. lockdown, would pediatric COVID-19 deaths typical flu season. Luckily due vaccines, know many children would died simply let coronavirus rampant US. Perhaps Brazil may give us idea. you‚Äôre still comparing novel coronavirus endemic colds flus?

I didn‚Äôt anywhere, theres whole lot shit immunocompromised population watch for. deadly, much. Covid likely become endemic well among dangerous thing (easily) aren‚Äôt helpful here.

Where strawman argument? can‚Äôt *force* entire antivaxx community get one, can‚Äôt stay lockdown/masks forever save people legitimately receive one. part straw manning, it‚Äôs called realistic.  Cool. remember paramedic wife trusting CDC (and know, thereby putting others danger) wierd insanely stressful situation odds ultimately right.

Fuck cdc. Highschool line 200 people waiting get vaccine, every single one kids. also Friday new variants much infectious dangerous kids. B117 think one may remember name wrong. Real life Kafka trap unlikely get store.

I'm worried work school people spend significant time around others want unmask. 

Altho chances shrink shrink Although lockdown restrictions won‚Äôt helping alleviate kind behaviour, happening since much earlier emergence Covid-19. Kids can‚Äôt held responsible actions anymore, thus consequences learn spoilt behaviour. Probably unpopular comment that‚Äôs perspective.  main problem don‚Äôt know long term effects vaccines yet. show proof? point said different source said.

Maybe reading topic learn that's actually big concern Well that's sad. Maybe guy misguided, bad bring fucking newborn work make ends meet? *Injecting bleach

Just remember exactly crazy shit Trump keep saying - what's left justify removing restrictions (including masks) places kids really go, like bars night clubs?

Even unvaccinated people go there, vaccinated people spread kids. saying cuz data said that. mask shortage thing revisionary BS. That‚Äôs ... I‚Äôm applying job. Right. Higher risk catch higher risk hospitalization death? evidence actually say work. literature cited CDC primarily sealed masks nebulizers shot dry inert particles find size get through. Cloth ranged completely ineffective moderately effective huge range surgical masks too. Now, that's ideal, dry, first time use conditions different mask seal face, humidity/saturation, etc. top know person next using cloth even work lab conditions. better guidelines wear *something* face?

The comprehensive studies found masks effective real world. could argue tiny bit effectiveness difficult detect statistically, basically saying they're slightly effective. couple months seems reasonable, younger people eligible long Every time raise issue like point inconsistency movie someone says ""you're supposed think that."" 

Unfortunately, case, effects pretending thing think go away movie ends. Okay what‚Äôs realistic suggestion? turn means, happen result ""Gas shortage"". media spreading shit. Facebook actually deleting people's photos proving woman putting gas silver tote wawa reddit 2010, allowing photo circulate. Yes should. many can‚Äôt. area need prove residency (or recently). Lots folks don‚Äôt paperwork. screw them? definitely rub salt wounds felt like. care opinions. proven stupid opinions valueless would care them? Anecdotal totally bring anything. think bringing information (dumb), took kids word it.  That‚Äôs good, I‚Äôm US, mostly speaking US. Lets hope whatever technology used, wont matter vaccines effective enough stop virus spreading. IDK...it‚Äôs pretty much story woman died Alberta. AZ vaccine, severe headache, told take Tylenol stay home, turned away local hospital. Personally, I‚Äôd head nearest big hospital (VGH) tell AZ symptoms. I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôll taken seriously. Skip nurses line unless you‚Äôre sure it‚Äôs bad case common vaccine side effect want advice manage it. way diagnose early, (treatable) stages antibody test. you‚Äôre likely get one large hospital. favor google medical procedures care. care anyone chose get vaccine.

Especially without nationalized healthcare system. were. are. awful people going continue suffer people's stupidity. Trouble really can't make take vaccines.

So guess question becomes long rest us go along theater? assholes spreading it, we're still stuck masks. I'm saying mind good example especially everyone can't get vaccine yet. figure ends.   hit nail head. shocking many (even parents) actively ignore even argue this, protecting kids potential life-altering effects less important whatever selfish indulgence adults mind. 

Your ferocious whimper lets know there's still hope others care consideration one another. Thank you. reduce speed limits 20 miles per hour everywhere? would greatly reduce deaths car accidents. really matter. protein target cannot change enough evade immune systems also still allowing virus infect humans. None variants able evade antibodies entirely  mean? post complication, people need facts decide want take vax not. got Pfizer means anti-vaccine type. necessarily, check folks getting cancer treatments learn I've heard someone say get vaccine get covid point. Looking world news makes believe that's 100% true.

I took option I'm encouraging everyone else know to. feel like unvaccinated adults wear masks anyway. point, fuck em. point people (immunocompromised, children) still could use enhanced safety people wearing masks, especially unvaccinated. people unvaccinated choice risk one masked, also people either cannot vaccinated vaccinated yet immunocompromised vaccine lower effectiveness (this way includes elderly degree, vaccine less effective younger people, ones likely die breakthrough infections) go free Given paranoid sounds like appropriate choice you.

I advanced degrees related fields, I've read large amount primary literature. take seems quite bit different yours.  guess makes ""expert"". sounds like someone personal history vaccine reactions? Keep tactics. biggest problem approach country taken. kids too, elderly accelerated senescence without proper socializing. Welcome March 2020 Like said, waste time interact pretend anything trying lie gaslight push narrative.  world's beat scientists flagging variants concern well going start wearing masks sick. Ah yes, floor made floor even need said?

Short people harder time reaching objects high shelves. News 11! Crazy Japan France highest percentage anti-vaxxers world. listen science says? whole entire time people repeatedly said trust science, CDC says vaccinated people don‚Äôt mask, suddenly everyone knows CDC. fact news headline ‚Äú16 year old dies covid‚Äù shows it‚Äôs insanely rare anything happen child. I'm fully vaccinated wear mask 8 hours day office. There's lady work immunocompromised child can't get vaccinated. I'll keep wearing it.

Seriously. work 12-13 hour shifts never break mask seal except outdoors 15 minute lunch/dinner breaks. long find mask fits well, uncomfortable issue. Lots people started wearing masks CDC recommended it. Remember said masks don‚Äôt work? sold everywhere? It‚Äôs almost like people don‚Äôt wait told CDC analyze available scientific info themselves. conversation start? Kids risk decision vaccinate parents. Yes, haven‚Äôt chance vaccinated CDC done horrible job pointing kids ones high risk level

We told everyone wear mask certain percentage population got vaccine cases low. wait even longer? many people - question can‚Äôt goalposts constantly move forgetting India cases???? People modelling behavior aerosols early 2020. Japanese research group even gave recommendation ventilate kind commonsense advice might caused huge disparity transmission rates Japan US. 

The failure CDC warn aerosols consequent failure emphasize ventilation preventable tragedy, ""public health authorities"" held accountable it. No, accelerating herd immunity getting vaccine refusers infected. explanation makes sense take knowledge human psychology account. Well, first, COVID killing thousands kids year US. total, killed 277 Americans age 18. So, facts wrong.

Second, I'm convinced we're two months away COVID Zero. lot people interested getting vaccinated. People less less willing keep social-distancing wearing masks. thought telling people masks two months would get us Zero COVID, I'd endorse it. thought actually wearing them, even, would get us there, I'd probably endorse too. don't. Less 4 months ago CDC says need 2 mask. say need wear mask settings y'all believe them.ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ want people prove vaccinated allowed store mask turned away throw tantrum it. I'm huge advocate masks stuff, keeping kidd sealed away months years fast track severe mental health issues. isnt okay. places largely back normal way awhile. lot people feel comfortable already - people need less time others, need more. don‚Äôt like segregating society based vaccinated - even temporary 100+ degree weather? 30 degree weather? agree- people taking precautions like masking weren‚Äôt CDC said to. I‚Äôm glad CDC finally say people mask, people listen them. I‚Äôm going say ‚Äúok cool, masks... cdc said so.‚Äù I‚Äôm going research decide it‚Äôs safe stop masking. argument maskers covid cautious people general picking choosing listen CDC false idea. news, water wet sun hot. 11. Preach Google (JHU CSSE Covid 19 data) agrees. 
Israel government site though seemed accurate last months checking. exponentially low mean? sky blue? shouldn't. that's case numbers would higher. That‚Äôs mostly they‚Äôve kept away people outside households past year+, they‚Äôre magically immune think it‚Äôs pretty fair someone worried potential side effects it. Saw post day said people still unvaccinated aren‚Äôt getting vaccine political reasons, wrong. I‚Äôm sure are, vast majority people still haven‚Äôt gotten likely worried side effects. I‚Äôm low risk anyway, hesitant get vaccine I‚Äôm young would rather get vaccine made year ago. get vaccinated realized LIKELY everything fine road don‚Äôt think would give entire population something that‚Äôs gonna kill cripple everyone 10 years. CDC stating obvious get people thinking passport? would verifying cards legit, would know sure they‚Äôve vaccinated, handle privacy logistical issues?

Also, don‚Äôt like segregating society way - don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs good path go down. Yes, people vaccinated persuaded it‚Äôs turning away society problem unvaccinated people aren‚Äôt great following directions  post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Just know... could factor 100 still would make right. I'm factor 100. leave look up. Unfortunately year scare mongering, peoples view risks messed up. healthy people 50 (most chosing get vaccinated.. death rate low risk dying off. simple fact. Thanks Captain Obvious Producer says product worth buying.


Skepticism aside, pretty good news. Indian variant supposed difficult vaccines handle variant could. I'm glad see predictions turning false. thousand people flip district. want Jim Bob wear mask every flu season well?

Yes well fitting N95 mask proven make safer, heck talking about? Even it‚Äôs small amount there‚Äôs still scientific proof helps

Absolutely. vaccine incredibly effective, still want risk exposed covid 10% symptoms. kill me, want miss couple days work (no paid sick days). wouldn‚Äôt say science 100% drove guidance - think public opinion played large role. People demanding looser restrictions cases dropped vaccinations increased. CDC delivered should. think could‚Äôve issued guidance lift mask mandates, - I‚Äôm scientist 

You argue acted rashly, soon... known vaccinated people safe don‚Äôt spread virus really even get it. CDC job - even caused lot confusion. don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs right though create society segregated vaccinated vaccinated. Ideally, everyone be, know could argue ways think every American deserves freedoms have. 

I think though CDCs messaging throughout pandemic way behind confusing - especially last months Using Bolton demographic breakdown almost absent vaccinated age groups, 'vast majority' hospitalisations caused people vaccinated age groups turned vaccine down.

So clear vaccines work it, really need vaccinate 12+ stop hot spots long run. levels risk still acceptable, think perspective reasonable. 

Another perspective children higher risk serious complications influenza covid. 

It good thing risk reduced vaccinations extremely low already, even level vaccinated people. 

FWIW think children anyone else vaccinated continue wearing mask I'm honestly optimistic.     can‚Äôt find data many 12-15 year olds first jab. I've mulling also long threads twitter.

That's part I'm worried about. right eardrum gets damaged hearing iffy two months every time get sick, fully intend masking shopping mass events indefinite future. longest I've ever gone without catching cold flu, addition avoiding covid. true, vaccinated people marginalized still get covid.

Also, peeps hanging Encinitas, CA today packed restaurants, lines maskless people crowded together waiting tacos hanging walking around, may odds favor. are? I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs trending now.

You guys really need better internet there, you‚Äôre like, six months behind. science shows vaccinated reduces likelihood person spreading covid wearing mask does. That's why. love people kids tell people without kids things kids.  news grass green. Tune next week CDC confidently tells us sky blue. number times I‚Äôve explain someone vaccine needs least 10-14 days post second dose help elicit best immune response astounding. I‚Äôll told XYZ got first dose got COVID 2 days later. 

I‚Äôm like ‚Äúyeah that‚Äôs happens don‚Äôt open parachute you‚Äôve hit ground‚Äù.  Hopefully Fauci apologize Rand Paul. .1% red Floridians dying change things drastically? Maybe I'm making mistake engaging someone clearly emotionally invested topic, hope give different perspective.

To start off: we're talking masks here. Indoors. We're talking lock downs, masking everywhere, vaccinated people wear masks around vaccinated people. masks indoors around strangers.

And let's say we're ignoring differences way standard flu spreads compared Covid-19, ignoring unknowns long term damage amongst adults children, ignoring fact kids wearing masks everywhere now, helping contain spread.

I'd love thought experiment:

Imagine ""the flu"" killed thousands children every year US (a reasonable proposition). Imagine vaccine ""the flu"" 95% effective. imagine something simple like wore gloves indoors around strangers could effectively cut community transmission near zero (but zero).

Now imagine recently made 95% flu vaccine available general public 30-40% people received it. vaccine yet available children. imagine possibly 2 months away, due vaccine glove wearing, lowering community transmission rate near zero. rate near zero could like Australia, New Zealand, number places virus kills literally one every day, adult child. people living normal lives like would ""the flu"" exist all.

Now imagine government, merely couple months away wonderful day decided really need wear gloves anymore. Vaccinated vaccinated, regardless age, one wear gloves anymore. they're sweaty, kinda suck put on, holding glass harder. current vaccination rate means virus stay alive amongst percentage population. means there's always reasonable threat un-vaccinated might contract pass children, cancer patients, people autoimmune diseases might die. 

But gloves suck, right? Two months much ask. thousands kids per year. places walk vaccines problems filling appointments awhile now. excuse now. Tell percent kids get covid think serious complications. cheat look up.  friend fully vaxxed too. Topic came asking going music festival scheduled September basically said unsafe. Folks coping hard right now. website truly deleted, mean everything it. might see stores changing policies next weeks; change happened really suddenly, they‚Äôre probably going need time check insurance companies see change not.

For time being, I‚Äôm wearing mask business still ‚Äúmask required‚Äù sign doors, next day I‚Äôm going wander around see stores don‚Äôt require mask. Also, CDC website:

""If condition taking medications weaken immune system, may fully protected even fully vaccinated. Talk healthcare provider. Even vaccination, may need continue taking precautions."" hard catch someone unvaccinated too. Oh no, marked absent! win situation. told people keep wearing masks, despite vaccinated, would undermine idea vaccines effective (and are). Yeah I‚Äôm going call bullshit point getting vaccine. I‚Äôm counting kids recently US could get vaccine. Drop link .1% referring to. Lol completely insane. wish people would get vaccine shut already. Let‚Äôs move on. Nobody telling feel honestly. hate people try tell others feel think morally superior. non-death impacts covid infection 18? anecdotal, friend (in 40‚Äôs) contracted November currently regained maybe 5-10% sense taste smell. son contracted regained sense taste 3 months, aren‚Äôt sure it‚Äôs completely back normal. vast majority people know contracted completely back normal. 

I understand risk death low minors, know risk lasting effects? don‚Äôt believe similar lasting effects contracting flu. feel free correct I‚Äôm read flu impact recent covid stats matter. sure lot choice destination though. agree you. everything power vaccinate adults. vaccine readily available whoever wants it. One way another people get antibodies reduce transmission vaccine COVID.
Now affect mutation rate lead vaccine resistant variants. know enough answer it. 
But point sacrificing believe COVID vaccines reach heard immunity feels reasonable. 
I feel sorry cannot get vaccinated though. Sadly selfishness others prevailed. I'm fucking done it. care anymore. feel nice rush schadenfreude hear swing around death bed late. People die 70-85% people vaccinated already caught antibodies.

It won‚Äôt stop herd immunity. Simply, people die get there. think rename site ‚ÄúUnReddit‚Äù Well, party 6 only. better nothing hopefully manage avoid Indian variant issues (by mean see increase cases translate increase hospitalisations deaths due vaccines) 5 weeks back complete normal. We'll see Exactly. across board situation dropping masks. example, I'm fully vaccinated still wear mask public transportation, use almost daily lot businesses still require mask worn. thing that's changed shed mask I'm outdoors feel safe going restaurant salon got shots. Otherwise still pandemic business usual.  study ever proofed that! Store probably 60/40 masked unmasked.

My state hit 40% fully vaccinated. Wonder there's correlation.

While get CDC trying say saying vaccinated need masks, make things bit awkward (my state, anyway) 40% fully vaccinated. know, see sides. one hand, think puts pressure ""willingly unvaccinated"" recognize need sign get shots rest us getting ready move back normal, one primary protections (masks) longer going mandated. hand, people got vaccinated shots available reaching fully vaccinated status, still younger population needs get approved shots get shots, least state narrowly avoided bad 4th wave, seems little early roll back mandates. literally 0.1% away going back strong restrictions week two ago, week we're already saying masks needed? (Yes, know last part vaccinated, I'm sure we'll unvaccinated claiming vaccinated, we're essentially conceding mask wearing honor system.)

I'm sorry. I'm tired, I'm rambling. Vaccines good, getting back normal life good, wish CDC delayed weeks. Yeah let's see, health minister said majority people infected Indian variant people legible vaccines get them... 

At least shows vaccine effective far great honestly, guess everyone introverted üòÜ EVEN true (it‚Äôs not), number SEVERELY LESS amount people dying COVID-19 day. What‚Äôs good bad case numbers entirely specific whether you‚Äôre using suppression elimination strategy. 5k us cases would amazing, 333 cases you‚Äôre trying zero COVID bad. Shortness breath. took million tests including x-rays CT scan, gave fluids, told pneumonia, sent home instructions come back oxygen levels dropped certain percentage. So, much. That's works. one magical efficacy number. 

If people infected asymptomatic mild symptoms means vaccine still working. understand try motivate people get vaccine. without means verification, honor system fail. I‚Äôm surprised didn‚Äôt attach benchmark like ‚Äúif state reaches 60% uptake, mask wearing ease vaccinated people.‚Äù Still anywhere close herd immunity, achievable improvement.

I'm semi-rural Oregon, lot people ignoring part take masks fully vaccinated, think everyone take masks stop following precautions. Businesses already relaxing rules. Since nothing enforced, people whatever want do. literally incentive go get vaccinated someone even fence it, honor system work one cares public health. think county 37% vaccinated, numbers slowed. governor considering vaccine passports, issue that, going make lot people angry. might actually get vaccination rate almost 100% LOL Good fries, long they're hot.

*Plan buy BioNTech shot delayed amid intervention ‚Äòoutside forces‚Äô, says health minister* 
 


A deal Taiwan buy 5m doses Covid-19 vaccine developed Germany‚Äôs BioNTech hold, island‚Äôs health minister said, citing potential pressure China delay. 
 
Taiwan‚Äôs health minister, Chen Shih-chung, said officials verge announcing deal December BioNTech pulled plug. 
 
While directly say China blame, Chen implied political dimension decision worried ‚Äúoutside forces intervening‚Äù, hence caution discussing planned deal publicly.

‚ÄúCertain people don‚Äôt want Taiwan happy,‚Äù added, without elaborating, radio interview. 
 
China, claims Taiwan territory, repeatedly sparred island coronavirus pandemic. 
 
Taiwan angered China‚Äôs assertion speak island international stage subject, Taiwan accused China lack transparency. 
 
BioNTech signed deal Chinese firm Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical Group exclusively develop commercialise Covid-19 vaccine products developed using BioNTech‚Äôs mRNA technology mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau Taiwan. 
 
In return agreed pay $85m licensing fees invest $50m stake German firm. 
 
BioNTech‚Äôs development distribution partner rest world US firm Pfizer. 
 
Chen said BioNTech asked speak Fosun, deal BioNTech ‚Äútorn up‚Äù, ‚Äúpending‚Äù. 
 
BioNTech said statement: ‚ÄúBioNTech committed help bringing end pandemic people across world intend supply Taiwan vaccine part global commitment. Discussions ongoing BioNTech provide update.‚Äù 
 
Fosun immediately respond request comment. China‚Äôs Taiwan affairs office declined immediate comment. China currently observing week-long lunar new year holiday. 
 
Taiwan announced late December agreed buy almost 20m Covid vaccine doses, including 10m UK drugmaker AstraZeneca, rest coming Covax global vaccine programme unnamed company. 
 
Additional reporting Philip Oltermann one family prove age kids. Matter fact pharmacies sign says ID refused. measure three ways:

-	first doses per 100k
-	fully vaccinated per 100k
-	total vaccine doses per 100k

The first epidemiologically relevant since vast majority efficacy comes first dose. third objective way show rollout progress ignores effect dosing gaps (caveat one dose vaccines though). U.K. ahead terms first total doses, like relevant metrics.  May ask needed ER? you? That's works. love head Michael Caine Muppets version first came mind. given logic, data shows flu riskier kids, think masks remain permanently? ones double say fake they're saying goodbye loved ones?  tired restrictions.

Fianc√© tested positive next day week later ER it.

Still got second shot. Yes, please care my.young children can't yet vaccinate.  hard tell anything vaccination rate seeing wears masks people go maskless without vaccinated like said, people might gotten Johnson Johnson vaccine final Moderna/Pfizer vaccine, still wait two weeks considered fully vaccinated go without masks according CDC. That's am. got second Moderna vaccine last week, wait 2 weeks get go maskless. suppose it'll normal wear masks indoors reach fully vaccinated point.

They ""recommend EVERYONE"" get it. Specialists work autoimmune disorders individuals compromised immune systems often recommend waiting clinical trails completed. reason need herd immunity people like friend (enough people get it, cannot get vaccinated safe). reason tell anti-vaxxers ""even kids healthy, still get vaccinated."" shit, sherlock  speaking tipping points, Rt go 1 since mask mandated ended? heard news India variant spreading north know going issue. guess see coming days help lot global push stop virus! guess Taiwan, model country everyone figured perfect excellent wearing paper face clean, ended able beat invisible enemy cannot stopped without vaccine. guess ‚Äústrict‚Äù were, tiny island, got lucky, matter time. like messaging. lot. Much better threatening people becoming outcasts. course implies vaccines cannot completely stop transmission, without vaccines deliberating choosing getting sick, sooner later, potentially fatal consequences themselves. 
Probably CDC predicting current vaccine coverage things get bad hospitals regardless infections rates, mutants, etc. So, care? People free decide getting sick, getting health care debts die Everyone. Rip mask wait states. wait gonna trust anti vax people honorable. wait stores. wait children need it? Well everyone vaccinated can‚Äôt course do. Uhhhhh ok clear shit instead ripping making everyone works retail heelish experiences ok wear helmet flying

...do now? time start moving on. Covid forever. going additional seasonal disease. flu covid back. 

If want risk without immunity you. mean need less Don‚Äôt enough vaccines  comment equal rates spread vs. without masks simply true.  one firm's VP Taiwanese epidemiologist family.

Exponential decay offset something simple masks, mutations, funding cuts, delay testing results, etc. driving factor happens. force giving vaccines, washing hands, and...wearing masks. 

There tipping points/thresholds we're going run mean blips exponential decay curve. They're plateaus stagnate unless alter approach. top that, always animal reservoirs tbh. I've always liked idea. CDC's recommendations huge joke. physican, I've stopped listening year ago continuously got everything wrong.

This one mixed messaging help. 

Wear masks indoors public places regardless vaccination status we're thing. small chance vaccine work well, also need get together much harder stores start policing gotten 2 vaccines. 

Outdoors never really major concern unless crowd. fully vaccinated, I'm happy need wear mask outdoors, always really low risk. 

The rest world's public health agencies furious CDC guidelines (I Canada). virus mutates enough escape immunity. CDC gonna repaint stupid picture chart red everyone again? 

Wear mask indoors. Get vaccines. Let's drop kick virus close 0 hospitalizations possible start celebrating ""Mission Accomplished"" banner.

True, studies shown vaccines 80% effective two weeks first dose. Again, that‚Äôs you‚Äôre concerned, one forcing go out. hide hit fully vaccinated level. People who‚Äôve gotten vaccine safe shouldn‚Äôt wait around everyone else they‚Äôre protected Moving forward, believe government public health officials acquiesce science deniers. climate change. public health measures. anything, really.

If US established mask mandates lifted 70% Americans vaccinated encouraged businesses schools require vaccines employees students (a policy already exists types vaccinations many schools workplaces), could create incentives people get vaccinated. We're subject state/local governments business mandate anyway. one *really* giving up. like think I'm fairly patient sensible subject, put mask CDC said I'm still wearing it. got vaccine soon could.

But there's toddler inside head that's throwing tantrum ever since reached full vaccination. want life back, want *income* back. (Restaurant industry)  Chicago. Why? Sheltering kids any, matter miniscule risk one worst things them. news water wet think got 70% vaxxed threshold. Cases low justify it. get it, CDC needs address directly. get ""vax green, novax red"" charts.  doubt there. know people haven‚Äôt pulling weight entire time. Now, mask-down policy gives excuse refuse pull weight, also take actions deliberately sabotage efforts sacrifices made past 14 months. really take us working together eliminate virus, literally mentality patience toddler. frustrating. covid targeted &lt;18 mortality targets now, nobody would give fucks it. experts say it‚Äôs fine stop wearing mask. Organizations people dedicated entire lives towards specialized public health sciences said that. totally understand concern past year, scientists say it‚Äôs safe take mask off, I‚Äôd inclined listen opposed anyone else tbh   point even mortality rate similar, COVID still bigger concern parents since kids much likely get it, since much contagious flu. Also, kids get vaccinated flu.  Why? vaccinated want get vaccinated ASAP already enormous problem. mandatory change anything - vaccinate anyway. vaccines highly effective prevent hospitalization death even breakthrough cases. trial data supporting this, along real world data collected Israel particularly convincing. mind, quite safe covid. 

But, taken precautions masking long, isn‚Äôt easy everyone snap back prepandemic lifestyle. need ease it, don‚Äôt rush yourself, take comfort fact you‚Äôre vaccinated shed mask you‚Äôre ready.  Narrator: didn‚Äôt. load utter Shite!!!! Luckily least affected disease medical policy makers relying 60 year old dogma. data like described challenged medical texts, oddly source. need worry you‚Äôre vaccinated. almost like he's public health expert something last place restrictions drop (probably rightfully so), even would anticipate restrictions dropping sooner masses think vaccinated, last restrictions dropped. vaccines fucking excellent.  Let sink swim. I'm tired fucknuts. Life much different modern country. nice fearmongering without specifics. ‚ÄúThe grass Green sometimes brown‚Äù CDC advises water said grass  I'm talking either

You're good company neither CDC üòí Exactly. side balance keeping exactly people aren‚Äôt hazard restrictions, (because contrarians aren‚Äôt following anyway,) point starts counterproductive. Yes. imagine thinking Anthony Fauci people trying take focus away pandemic. course develop ""cheap easy"" system cheap easy. get $$ wherever can. never subway trains before? That‚Äôs great! 

Is Sunday low reporting day, typically? Haven‚Äôt watching numbers closely lately. definitely bit cluster getting in. entrance went merging lines didn‚Äôt open doors right 4:15 local time advertised. Causing lines spill streets. well done Toyota Center staff, UFC, etc. complaint night. Yep I'm talking either. needs clinical trials 12 crowd vaxxed. absolutely blows mind going breakfast yesterday last time I‚Äôll wear one outside unusual circumstances. still can‚Äôt fathom anyone would turn vaccinated outside health / age reasons, fucking happy, people missing HARD Hmm. Citing immunocompromised people reason end mask usage seems lot like non-terminal reason. Immunocompromised people go away time period. Idk that‚Äôs pretty privileged assumption. Lots parents dependent child care, public transport, bringing kids store, etc. Remember weekends general report less cases labs work weekend. Double masks what? 

Take off, keep on, make decision yourself. CDC says, make decision yourself. using passport bars, restaurants, sports, etc, kept masks supermarkets. vaccine widely available US nearly month... news, people lie carriageway risk run over. look excess deaths Sweden find likley underreporting significant degree. That‚Äôs fair, think makes sense compare total cases. Total US symptomatic flu cases 2018 flu season 36 million. There‚Äôs 33 million COVID. Cases far US. I‚Äôd guess COVID better tracked flu.

I‚Äôm much agreement rhetoric COVID ‚Äúbasically flu‚Äù don‚Äôt want downplay it‚Äôs obvious severity, mortality rate kids seems pretty similar. Raquel Mitchell recovered bout COVID-19 December  
adamant getting vaccine, doesn‚Äôt trust  
the quick development. She‚Äôs still wearing mask taking  
precautions, like dining outdoors restaurants near home New  
York‚Äôs East Harlem area either asking plastic utensils  
bringing own.

&amp;#x200B;

When feel it‚Äôs safe enough ease up?

&amp;#x200B;

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. Never,‚Äù said Mitchell. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going really difficult me.‚Äù

&amp;#x200B;

Ok, people article reasons might agree disagree. final one absolute m0r0n, way around that. This... this... f'n this. I've damn discussion person here, seems kids tossed aside. parent catching ""mild case"" full blown Covid case child caught. 99% vaccinated people protected Covid don‚Äôt need continue hiding caves anymore get living.

You beforehand either.

A lot people even oppurtunity fully vaccinated announcement. held couple weeks, would've given chance least. yesterday, still signs masks required local one. feels like common sense people not. coworkers refuse vaccinated going trips, properly wearing masks literally sees least hundred people day. -should- taking precautionary approach, reactive. ""Exponential growth intuitive""

&amp;#x200B;

Heard early pandemic might non-outrageous reasons (e.g., vaccinating populations first). That‚Äôs debate be. Instead, they‚Äôre pretending there‚Äôs plan all. fucking duh Read comment replied to. person talking completely different things. definitely big step change, reality announcement like going happen significant amount population remains unvaccinated matter what. waited July 4th, example, angry medical talking heads would citing unvaccinated percentages ~10% lower saying reason early. living restrictive conditions year would impossible formally admit scientific fact vaccinated people return normal without sending shock waves. irrelevant comparing proportions died population Dope, lift restrictions people they'll end hurting themselves. like access vaccine. According Worldometer, Sunday recorded 17,834 cases COVID US. lowest since March 26th, 2020! positive rates still 15% almost states, far over. 4x kids died per population compared vaccinated adults. Wut 100%. 

I ready done mental health terrible last year. 

I knew going return life normal soon got vaccinated, that‚Äôs wife did. felt weird crowd first, you‚Äôre vaccinated experience freedom vaccined. simply don‚Äôt worry anymore feels amazing social again, eating out, going indoor places without worrying, etc. Well... have. Exponential growth. still people staying home fear open jobs employers can‚Äôt fill. jab yesterday I'm 23, love it! Yes! This! comparing rate complications someone got flu rate complications someone got COVID. COVID appears bigger risk kids much contagious, therefore much likely get it. Also, unlike COVID, there's vaccine kids take flu.

To give example, said likely die seriously hurt lightning strike car crash. True, much likely get car crash, that's bigger concern. general population, would say car crashes ""more deadly"" lightning strikes, since people die them. Wrong. 95% protective catching it. 5% catch it, still get severe hospital inducing symptoms. mean protect vaccinated, vaccinated pretty safe point. wonder CDC captain obvious statements they'd like make. show Wells tuberculosis decades ago. Based things said Canadian health officials (eg. Bonnie Henry saying might get ‚Äúgather small groups‚Äù fucking July long weekend Theresa tam wanting indoor gatherings 75% Canadians second dose fucking autumn) don‚Äôt hope Canada B.C. going return normal even something resembling anytime soon. states vaccinated people allowed go maskless basically whatever want lots second dose health officials don‚Äôt want us changing behaviour whatsoever getting vaccine people second dose. bad feeling restrictions going persist well past due date I‚Äôm praying god provincial governments start ignoring Theresa tam Horgan starts ignoring Bonnie Henry that‚Äôs want doubt would. 

This pandemic Canada‚Äôs hesitancy easing restrictions taking away every last shred patriotism country. used proud Canadian feel anger. Si'pore literally city state highest population density size entire world. think problem social inequality, virus, everyone really created equal. Like nations children? ones approved vaccine for? Actually numbnuts Nextdoor saying masks work number cases increased recommended. Right, that's Texas, ridiculous. Half people get vaccinated purpose. Depends live, many western countries almost over.  think valid compare flu death rates year socially distancing, wearing masks, really taking special precautions COVID death rates year taking lot precautions?  hate draw ‚Äúflu‚Äù comparison, every year unlucky kids get flu die. People die car crashes every day. Nothing life happens without level risk. chances child actually getting seriously ill Covid extremely low. Certainly doesn‚Äôt outweigh developmental risks normal life extended period time they've stopped calling me? scam home now? going guy spends day front door checking IDs vaccines cards? Kinda like security guy bar ‚Äúbanned list ‚Äú. No? Ok then, idea sucks. quite mind boggling me, non american, huge organization CDC sees need state something like this. like saying youre risk u jump building.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  I'm 24 I've first jab. know multiple people 20s first dose gotten letter it. Wales absolutely bossed rollout. Yet people get upset anyone comments CDC less reliable handling pandemic. support vaccine. don‚Äôt support mandatory Remember Fauci told us mask beginning? Yeah, bad. it‚Äôs Republican Texas somehow. Sadly wearing masks political thing. higher chance surviving vaccine, surviving covid. Ftfy. fully vaccinated option wear mask not. unvaccinated run get vaccinated fast can. Credibility get kids flu vaccine, relevant comparison. (Not person responded still). I've heard immunity. reads like actual maniac wrote though okay? keep seeing people saying I‚Äôm curious one sure masking near elimination social life. suspicions, suppose interesting experiment. comment   think counterarguments comments 12 crowd. mostly agree you, points

Peer pressure big deal kids friends make fun pull others' masks. teachers/administrators anti-maskers begin enforcing policies schools allowing COVID run rampant good look either. schools area automated system send emails kid schools tested positive, fairly recently would happen daily basis.

As odds child die COVID, biggest question whether risk necessary not. There's good chance kids dying car crash way school speed limits low, wear seatbelts anyway cost/benefit analysis indicates there's real benefit going without seatbelts. Additionally, there's secondary question frequent ""long COVID"" happens children, looking like might frequent enough much valid concern death.

Also fourth point, think Pfizer Moderna targeting 2 years September-ish. result, think we're going totally different place fall, biggest risk families infants toddlers, already something parents deal (especially avoiding sick people newborn.) think Halloween completely normal, kids people want vaccinated done long time then. summer, however, mix lot people families still avoid lot public places. Christ, trying make humorous observation. point say bloke allowed this, anyone harass him. I'm making obvious point things changing due vaccination, extreme cautionary measures would looked bit OTT even winter wave look paranoid time.

I know things US quite polarised heated last years, think people need take break reactionary lecturing. roommate kind like this. wears mask everywhere still hasn‚Äôt gotten vaccine doesn‚Äôt think there‚Äôs enough research pushed fast she‚Äôs waiting see long term effects. 

... I‚Äôm like, girl, okay. Take chance want to. doesn‚Äôt wear mask around friends family. viral load vaccinated people get low probably asymptomatic spreading also happen really really. Unless unvaccinated person sneezes straight unmasked face fine. thing rising childhood obesity rates, blood sugar levels, instances heart disease.

Should make succeed Union point, shuck dead weight. Last resort, determined putting people moment got ER bad keep deteriorating quickly intubation/ventilator place work lifted mask mandate. word vaccine never used COVID-19 related emails. Pretty disappointing. welcome wear mask long want. 

Don‚Äôt expect others though. Also realize may minority. ever thought world outside North America? People Europe definitely call jab. making work, kid also young wear mask simple. means take extra precautions back things mostly outdoors family. Oh, people done Covid. vaccine available children yet. US, may available late Summer Fall depending age child. Especially parents, continuing wear masks months rational way try protect kids able receive vaccine. rate spread plummeting.

Even better ""should be"" data! Check infection rate NJ, really good vaccine uptake rate across (Scroll ""infection rate"")

The graph beautiful. That's really late damn many people refusing vaccine since that‚Äôs case I‚Äôm board government mandating it. that‚Äôs way end pandemic soon possible, it. Anti-vaxxers weren‚Äôt masking first place‚Ä¶ understand reasoning use carrot vaccinate, messaging botched. 

I feel sorry deal (large portion the) populace intent killing itself. vaccines chance blood clots like, especially people little risk COVID, they're risk something negative happen body getting vaccine. mention might side-effects long-term know about. even disregarding that, people can't get anyway medical concerns, exiled supposedly-free society.

99% people get COVID survive, symptoms. Ebola. parents make sure take necessary precautions make sure kid get sick COVID. Children fall category immunocompromised people point, onus (or parents accurately) make sure get sick. kid still wear mask stores. they're saying unmask now? dumb enough get vaccinated take mask get covid. Survival fittest? last sentence. US one higher infection rates beginning. already went India others going now. fair, Greece really needs it. tourism pretty average recent years COVID. ....so long isn‚Äôt permanently mandated made ‚Äúnew normal‚Äù. able get vaccine, choose to, sympathy that. Trump get hired CDC? wondering stupid fuck , going kill people prolong plague. ""sanitation theatre"" someone called it.

""It's fine, wiped things, we're Covid-safe now"". No. man drive car eat food? They're potentially fatal actions. case hypochondria doubt. Kids 12 high risk covid. They‚Äôre actually higher risk flu nobody ever made us wear masks whole lives stop that. mean best flu season house ever. point approved vaccine kids 12 it‚Äôs parent‚Äôs choice yet. even people vaccinated still get this. would rather continue wear mask get numbers way down. Also people like bad reaction first dose likely get second delay it. saying [CDC wrong risk complications healthy children higher flu compared COVID-19.

You can't make apples apples comparison directly flu solely based 2020 stats guidelines last year extremely effective preventing flu (even preventing COVID). I‚Äôm sure would love that. south busy ""rising again"" pay bills. Airborne AIDS exact  Unfortunately best response 

‚ÄúNo fucking shit‚Äù

It really depressing repeat again. Yes soon enough people unvaccinated people really care COVID, ...  fact unvaccinated people still spread lot even vaccinated people. frustration kid still young vaccinated. Also cancer chemo patients immunocompromised risk everyone drops masks. someone else wearing mask affect you? 

I‚Äôm serious. care? shit.  father unvaccinated kid can't bring stores anymore.

You still can, kid wear mask social distance others.

I hope vaccine gets approved kids sooner later, still think make work short term happens. ‚Ä¶ without involved accident car. pass unlucky.

They wait till vaccination works Covid die SOON. hard time dealing proudly anti-vax people. happily chat people fence genuinely want learn science personal experience. want listen, refuse engage.  No, can't get vaccinated tomorrow. several week process immunized. got immunized day opened vaccine everybody, would STILL process completely vaccinated, premature this. happened April 19th. takes six weeks getting moderna shot fully vaccinated, puts May 31. add week everybody waiting get shot get it, puts June. announced, middle June, middle May. Worldwide, yes it‚Äôs going deadliest year, look what‚Äôs happening India. developing world long ways vaccinated going see surges throughout year. US, enough vaccine uptake pandemic here. can‚Äôt take scientists saying world whole apply countries highly vaccinated. worst US one surge among unvaccinated done, I‚Äôd guess lot people would refuse vaccine also refused take precautions pretty high rate natural immunity since would gotten infected earlier. üòÇü§£üòÜ Institutionalized knowledge management aka monopoly knowledge. I've got 3 kids 9, kept inside isolated last year March April. Beginning May started travel ball playdates again. They've 5 days week school since October, soon opened.

I zero worry getting covid type issues it. pediatrician also told us worry. CDC says water wet. flu covid similar long-term effects hospitalized. Covid little long-term effects mild cases. point, data needs entered system -- humans fallable! CHS definitely sucks.

But lawsuits years unpaid bills, services rendered, bills need paid.

The south supposed personal responsibility, unpaid bills all? get closer 37%, though. quickly. US still administering doses ~0.75% population per day. exactly. lot people seem totally forgetting children can‚Äôt yet vaccinated. I'm tempted too, suspect get sick last year primarily everyone else wearing mask, was. Nice!  Well done! :) well aware masks work better stopping infected spreading rather stopping people getting it. It‚Äôs simple you‚Äôre saying. Kids risk now. think people sceptical many governments relaxed rules caught head back heavy lockdowns. 

It's hard say ""right, we're back normal now"", real certainty fact.

Some people would rather stay routine. Yea, lot people see wearing kn95 masks dont even wear properly, might well cloth. way know vaccinated without article, people allergic things inside vaccines, even vaccinated, even though highly effective, 100% guarantee. Many people chronic conditions would death catch covid. nothing wrong additional preventative measures, one face judgements taking care themselves. 

Additionally people chronic anxiety issues make unhealthy decisions based fear judgement. 

You herd people US chose follow unqualified opinion based outside science puts us higher risk, perhaps lives area highly populated them. agree, mean there's reason fully vaccinated context COVID.  vaccine trackers actually use 2020 population numbers states? use newest population estimate total US I've seen, states outdated population numbers. you‚Äôre fully vaccinated, CDC believes it‚Äôs performative measure, unnecessary vaccine offers sufficient protection. Yeah still don‚Äôt see dose 2 happening July. I'm saying received vaccine anti-vax un-vax people dont matter fine. Except doesn‚Äôt really address all. many anti maskers point out, masks 100% effective. takes everyone wearing lower likelihood human human transmission. CDC saying vaccinated people chose wear masks anymore invite everyone take masks regardless. original point... you‚Äôre kid immunocompromised obligated to...be somewhere. You‚Äôre put higher risk. immunocompromised probably group already wearing mask everywhere already kids? They‚Äôll find excuse wear mask. others pointed out, convince child still wear mask adults longer to? answer can‚Äôt. serious concerns absolutely result people getting sick to. 

The worst thing we‚Äôve done surprisingly good job vaccine distribution we‚Äôre months away addressing majority concerns brought here. Yes immunocompromised people still screwed that‚Äôs literally nature immunocompromised. would‚Äôve least done best efforts protect children decrease likelihood preventable transmissions...

The CDC report facts also power guide public policy. wielding latter responsibly all. Vaccines far effective masks, you‚Äôre vaccinated impact mask going marginal best. problem places like Japan. used work Japan 1980s high flu season, almost everyone Japan wore mask. pre-COVID. issue North America. Even Europe, sure wearing masks non-issue.  spending heaps time Yemen? Type 1 great data have. Lines I've seen biggest risks 1) already complications diabetes become significant determining outcome 2) control BS get sick key. None comment does. Everything take granted not. want make free vaccines, start trying profit.

What advertising? whole comment ""but price it!?"" right imagine kids 12 probably make decision whether get vaccinated begin with. That's decision parents. 

It sucks kids really fault, basically view kids collective whole parents now. parents make sure kids stay healthy. I'm going continue wear mask people gross angry resting face. parents do, can't always leave kid home. article many upvotes? thought fucking obvious lmao American. Americans idea cluster is. Clusters equal control. Identify isolate clusters Taiwan get control quickly.

At point pandemic, knew would wave hit Taiwan Singapore. Especially irresponsible countries spreading like wildfire. Turns took India contagious variant break through. (Likely help complacency.) Still worse flu. I‚Äôm happy make sure boomers protected say death statistically lower children. One many everything keep people safe. going sacrifice number kids statistically less affected there‚Äôs still dead kids. allow take mine get vaccine right now. dumbass rural state heard CDC thing stupid heard first part. Literally conversation store yesterday 

Hick Stranger: ""Hey didnt see news need wear stupid mask anymore! Take dumb thing off!"" 

Me: ""I got second dose yesterday, still wait 2 weeks. get second dose???""

HS: ""I ain't getting bullshit Biden/gates brainwashing chip, I'm stupid!"" need hazmat suit special wear mask. Yeah, soft people can't stand told what's right. That's much! increase chance again! totally need ignore can't vaccinate!!! Solving problems long way off. wait zero risk? vaccine provides protection mask. really need explain this? Ohio family Big Mad this, I'm shrugging shoulders, thinking money better spent ad campaigns people ignore, better odds continue dumbasses, I'm definitely right skip family reunion year. basically lmao except ofc aint gon rights continue wear mask face?

/me gets glue ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm paid per-service, no. appreciate effort; that‚Äôs really kind you. Yes coronavirus bigot. forget [living abusive nursing science also say non-vaccinated people lie vaccination status remove masks first opportunity? Pretty soon people wearing masks cautious people vaccinated want take chance. Getting second dose delayed 12 weeks optimal efficiency plus 2 weeks till effective. arguing point with? can‚Äôt me, didn‚Äôt say probability spreading high. said risk worth avoiding. trivial effort guaranteed safety contexts good trade. would different?

In case still haven‚Äôt demonstrated people dumb cautious. Good. video someone putting gas plastic bag inside wicker laundry hamper. Probably kids low risk they're counting them. harm kids wearing masks social development likely outweighs benefits; made wear masks protect rest society.

In Canada there's issue people saying going back normal life quickly, literal opposite: government keeping us lockdown perpetuity constantly shifting goalposts *might* able get *some* lifting restrictions. They're even suggesting vaccines ""100% effective"" (nothing is) therefore really anything, borderline anti-vaxx propaganda. I'm done country doormats allow government anything everything them. good

You must American lol think masks longer required *domestic* planes, trains, buses? (I'm aware international transportation might take longer every country good vaccinating populace us.) 

Right mandate goes September. last time extend it, lengthen again? extension necessary?    mean ‚Äúshoved previously exposed well understood effects racism everyone‚Äôs face‚Äù? Doug Ford, Justin Trudeau Jason Kenny worst politicians recent Canadian History. bungled whole situation get-go. 

If think losing ability make living restricted government go gather reason protest is?

Also want play soccer sign made laugh. good Singapore's vaccination program? Vietnam üáªüá≥. 

The country shut schools last week. Would mind posting links studies? couldn‚Äôt find CDC‚Äôs site.  Idk, never rarely use never burn. sunscreen wearing people wear enough re-apply like get burnt. sucks. wear frigging mask, protect others. reach like 80% vaccinated reconsider. bite us pretty bad within Almost half children contract covid-19 may lasting symptoms, factor decisions reopening schools, COVID Killing Many Young Children Brazil?

A lot commercial locations aren‚Äôt designed good climate control open door. 

Most people would complain. complained like schools don‚Äôt air conditioning. reason vaccinated protect people. several days since first case. Mass testing (first round) already completed one city one county (Feixi county Hefei) Anhui. batch size rumored 10. Round 2 may start days. think strategy two fold
1. shows reward vaccinated hopes getting people vaccinated
2. starts teaching hard lessons antivaxers deniers that, yes. thing fact real. imagine someone close get it, hard lessons start really sink in. ...and us never able afford it. Yeah, 16 month old can't wear mask yet, particularly reliant others around wearing them. safe take anywhere. sucks mask mandate lifting everyone going lives go even stricter lockdown. used able feel relatively comfortable grocery store crowded.

I also hate dismissive retort since children likely die serious complications covid means longer give shit kid gets it. friend whose kid survived put commission several weeks. Parents use sick leave poor kid miserable. know long-term affects 2, 3, years road. also highly contagious. I'd shitty parent attitude ""fuck it, let get infected"".

We're also dense urban area 33% population vaccinated. also live predominantly black neighborhood high vaccination hesitancy. African American vaccination rate state 21%. like chances getting low.

I'm partly worried social pressure everyone unmask wearing mask broadcasting publically unvaccinated.

So we're frantically trying mask train 16 months, going back ordering groceries, longer taking library, seeing get enrolled vaccine trial children. Pfizer's one nearby, double-blind know antibodies end. I'm really happy people get go back normal lives, kinda sucks excluded keep kid locked instead.  **WHY REDEEMING?** Ok. Another one? r/NoShitSherlock Greece one. Better late never suppose? confirm.

Like fuck research figure topic lol /me waiting chance get vaccines, months till second shot weeks till I'm vaccinated.

Anti-Masker waiting unmask. Blizzard weather? Tornado weather? Tear gas? Nerve gas release? Godzilla attack? 

If pointing edge cases opening windows issues response general recommendation circumstances allow point them? would surprising honestly - conservatives appear fueled vast majority cases first wave. can‚Äôt seriously believe warnings would go unheeded. shouldn‚Äôt assume higher-income countries plans share.

Also, warn entire global public? could‚Äôve email. Water Wet, NOAA Director Says. live, disease ""barely happened""... help governor pretends trump 2.0

People going back business usual already.  put gasoline plastic bags throw car? that's anti-maskers germs face.  better mask up? see going easy get appointment March 29?

I'm Virginia; state opened vaccines everyone, vaccine appointments slammed three weeks. online midnight, site added new dates, chance.

Now fine, even walk-in vaccinations places. fair say anybody wanted get vaccinated early April could get appointment. Saved comment fits many situations life, topic. Go back normal immediately alienating half customers. Brilliant. That‚Äôs shocking! It‚Äôs difficult run vaccination clinic. world crying vaccinations it‚Äôs really bad sitting citing logistical problems. grocery store yesterday walk appts available 16+. state vaccine available 70+ crowd? Unless mean gotten around that's different available.  78 year old aunt able get vaccine since beginning feb still made time get it. That's though. Seasonal influenza kills children‚Äôs annually covid significant margin.

Source. sources saw US say covid killed times 2020 flu 2019. Might depend age range look at. grown quickly? Daily recent numbers 15, 11, 21, 25, 34, 185, 207, 333. Generally false. know specifics surrounding condition schedule medications highly recommended rheumatology patients receive covid vaccinations soon care allows.

&amp;#x200B;

Ask doctor appropriate time receive vaccine (e.g. immunosuppressants left system next dose). really believes need one, question Bwcause true. IFR similar much higher R0 covid causes kids per year get infected die it. There's bunch those, horizon üëç Nah Well, solution problem... Eligible SIGN UP, depending could weeks out. 

I think refusing recognize literally able get it. states easy checked state April 19th appointments mid may earliest, checking soon opened April 19th. 

I understand got can't comprehend people go through. Lol article covid racism one mention Asian-Americans.  Oh no. Someone isn‚Äôt complying must add fear!! üòÖ ""We understand 48 million people ineligible vaccine. made decision unmask country \_\_\_\_\_\_\_. Kids 12 expected \_\_\_\_\_\_."" American healthcare covers 90% people, basically everyone that's employed social services, Covid feds covered everything including rent help. Walmart announced lifting face mask policy. Starting tomorrow Walmart require masks. SARS-CoV-1 defeated quarantine local lockdowns. ‚ÄúWhy care people want wear masks outside?‚Äù

I really don‚Äôt, it‚Äôs definitely ironic people screaming year science data. straight saying don‚Äôt believe it. 

It‚Äôs form trusting vaccines, believe things beat virus. Gotta shame want pretend everything's fine sake open 'er jobsite right now, can't see youtube clip. go later studies linked recent guidance decision? back March April, May. Sounds like likely explanation would saw earlier studies maybe wanted see findings replicated? anti-vaccine idiots history, relegated shame century.

the end near yet: must continue push right thing trying convince Americans get vaccinated. 

we see what's going 2 days since CDC announcement fully vaccinated: desperation anti-vaccine idiots left arguments trying stop vaccination program way can. 

mostly political reasons.

but make mistake: irrelevant loud, represent small minority practically insignificant.

the rest vaccine resistance come them. That's must continue promote vaccination program that's working like magic. People keep mentioning kids, ignoring immuno-compromised also can't get vaccinated, much likely die it. I've stopped wearing mask. store going make I'll wear I'm wearing mine anymore. can't get sick we're fully vaccinated can't spread everyone scared? Yeah know there's tiny chance getting sick tiny chance spreading tiny amount covid scared get sick social life going depression. Go enjoy. shield protects others getting sick... Narrator: *they did* fuck good
News? weren‚Äôt ambivalent last year? people survive normal flu. look numbers two it‚Äôs comparable. unvaccinated republicans choice. anti maskers republicans choice. Let die, improve country. also make less likely get covid. better protect re-infection (variant otherwise) title makes seem like pronouncement came head Texas Studies dept University Oklahoma. doctor says masks work aerosols problem ""evaporate within milliseconds"". government make people wear masks on. However vaccinate patients, he's weird. continue wear mask (FFP2 + regular one) travel public transit, even COVID control vaccines. I've always hated overcrowded trains people sniffing coughing. got bad flu years ago certain got guy coughing ass two seats away me! even flu shot kids die flu covid - that's point.

False.  


In US 2020 3 pediatric deaths influenza complications.

 
In US 2020 300 pediatric deaths Covid 19. I‚Äôve noticed many stores quietly took signage formal press release announcement makes things confusing. people shouldn‚Äôt give others dirty looks wearing masks outside wearing mask outside impact life either. 

I think people talking ‚Äúfreedumbs‚Äù saying people need mind business pretty interesting turn events. basically voted local (township) level Dolno≈õlƒÖskie Voivode (superior township council, overseeing whole voivodeship (region) ) deem legal illegal end May.

Anyway, basically impossible compulsory vaccination become thing Poland. would definitely cause nationwide protests. problem demand slowed due ignorance republican lies. unvaxxed people taking masks way knowing who.
 
They continue spread new variant arises threatens us all. Again. I‚Äôm vaccinated think everyone get vaccine.

I absolutely disagree idea government mandate people put bodies. Absolutely, bit rich judging harmless loonies anyway! Also news: water wet. amount ambivalence regarding virus airborne quite annoying want say can‚Äôt wait Memorial Day weekend. buddies coming visit, year lined perfectly birthday falling it. 

We going deep sea fishing first day. Hanging beach making fools girls next. wrapping nap bar crawling.

I can‚Äôt wait!!! helps particulate matter really bad people cities. studies showing people schools air filters better test scores. So, literally everyone 12? afraid flu? Statistically speaking it‚Äôs way dangerous children COVID.

In US 2020 3 pediatric deaths influenza complications. 
In US 2020 300 pediatric deaths Covid Oh homemade masks.

Nothing answer. can't even blow match. 

So what's point? way I'd ever wear shitty paper masks even worse- corporate made cheap thing trying sell profit. vast majority people allergic reaction it. can't dictate policy based severe minority. big true Singapore's standards success quite different UK. understand *some* infections even vaccination, long translate hospitalisations deaths OK. Infection alone cause alarm UK, basically whether NHS cope going forwards.

In Singapore, infection levels kept low throughout pandemic 28 cases considered major. think going issue countries experienced worst covid due successful elimination strategies - acceptance vaccines mean 100% protection risk infection, even dramatically reduce overall largely eliminate serious cases.

Of course strategies far really successful trade seems happy with, strategy without long term challenges. person's post history trip. already stopped leaving house covid they're trying convert everyone way life. Sad. That‚Äôs even true large majority time

Even single kidney chances anything happening 0.0002%, guaranteed lie come from?? Yeah, we‚Äôre suffering :,) problem see masks work sick. wear feeling fine plane nobody else wearing it. chance still getting randomly sick end still pretty much same. Masking works people sick wears them. That‚Äôs masks important pandemic many people could symptoms contagious. old job (quit Feb fully remote position field due covid handled properly) texting coworker. lifted mask mandate office ONE gotten vaccinated. Kinda maddening Yup. He‚Äôs one. Unless natural immunity. would fine case.

Funny keep leaving part US 2020 3 pediatric deaths influenza complications.

In US 2020 300 pediatric deaths Covid 19. [Serious Question]
I‚Äôm vaccine, encourage at-risk people get it. I‚Äôve heard vaccine doesn‚Äôt prevent getting covid, makes less dangerous get it.

So healthy college athlete (20M), Covid June 2020, symptoms. issue wearing mask, I‚Äôm afraid getting Covid so;

Why need go get vaccine? (Serious, logical, factual answers please) priority categories set state, federal level. state (VT) prioritize grocery store workers. Anyone 18-29 teacher, healthcare worker, one medically qualifying conditions eligible April 19.

Also, counted category varied state state. Different medical conditions prioritized different states. states said college professors teachers, others k-12 teachers only. It‚Äôs good idea goodness it‚Äôs toxic fair, organization said general population need wearing masks early pandemic, despite good evidence contrary. Whether actually sound advice based understanding time utilitarian decision save masks healthcare workers, severely tarnished reputability organization. person dick. zero problem getting non-essentials want (like fucking Ruby Tuesday's haha) requires people leave house prepare them, something apparently think super dangerous, they'll still avail service. another comment also brag money dropped high quality media room. 

It's hilarious think video chatting face face, person can't even imagine world people would *want* swap germs lol (aka sex). Saskatchewan also said stopped use AstraZeneca lack supply.

It‚Äôs important note safety concerns issue AstraZeneca. disappointing production output delayed deliveries many countries, including Canada, making decision go mRNA vaccines even easier. Airports probably keep place long federal properties. I‚Äôll bet individual airlines start implementing policies independently. see opportunities money incentive mask flights, don‚Äôt think they‚Äôll hesitate capitalize. kind thing distancing seating arrangements.  crazy Dutch crazy Dutch things. Sure thing, added original comment. Hopefully change mentality Covid mean sick people mask consideration others. let's face it, coughing sneezing public going taboo next years now. Gwen Cooper Part wants think lifting mask mandate attempt ""vaccinate"" antivaxxers old fashioned way: expose virus let build immunity. 1) one year old can‚Äôt wear mask. experts (who trust) told safe, we‚Äôd masking
2) gave birth COVID hospital, idea would done before, always always planned requiring anyone around kid date shots, including flu shot, I‚Äôve always gotten
3) trust experts, kid daycare believe risk limited worth socialization

I‚Äôm going engage further, hope remember person end Internet conversation human. It‚Äôs hellish year trying keep kid elderly parents safe work expert guidance often clear mud. went lockdown third trimester limited medical care end pregnancy wasn‚Äôt clear doctors even medical setting could made safe enough. People whose kids even couple months younger much different evidence-based experience evidence.

We‚Äôre trying best. I‚Äôve spent much energy year trying right thing kid, balancing real need safety need support family friends young families have. guidance makes harder, easier, us indoor spaces. We‚Äôll continue enjoy outdoor settings, can‚Äôt shop groceries attend daycare outdoor setting, data comforting young children‚Äôs chances showing symptoms, also cases long term complications COVID toddlers make risk unmasked indoor time unacceptable me. yeah... properly worn, washed, coupled social distancing hand washing. seen bunch kids wearing masks before? ain't protecting anyone anything community transmission high population large amount vaccinated people herd immunity, like US, perfect place one develop especially measures place prevent that. It‚Äôs controversial subject gets clicks. use numbers statistics time stamps can't misremembered time stamps found place cdc saying medical staff wear masks time frame claiming said to. Get vaccine, wear mask, complain management, ask reassignment, find new job, collect unemployment

Pick one anything complaining expecting entire rest world bend fears. see taking away motivation. bother remove mask now? Makes difference Thanks sharing this. get downvoted every time link it. People don‚Äôt like facts, prefer ‚ÄúI‚Äôm done inconvenienced‚Äù narratives Ahh you‚Äôre right. bad.  Get vaccinated, people. That's common immune response foreign object body. worse, better reasons always hold belief vaccine 'should never say safe'. Preprint articles require higher degree scrutiny rigor accurately evaluate many types articles. kind discussion would appropriate strictly scientific subreddit /r/COVID19.

Admittedly say excluded primary analysis likely supplementary 4400, 1/3rd 1/2 4400 ~25 cases placebo group (so 8 cases) gives little predictive power. CI almost certainly includes 0 data, CI probably ranges 50%+. 

While data-backed position, seems *likely* natural immunity protection &lt;50% Don't. new variant still circling. evolving science vaccines work? telling handed shit knowing whether would work? plan b didn't? logic, never mask mandate, people wear N95 social distance!

An N95 mask.......... say ""we never mask mandate"" ""all people wear N95"" sentence unironically  adults eligible since 19th April. month. second shot now, close it. That's significant protection even technically fully vaccinated. 

I see issue people prioritizing getting vaccines. still shot. risk people able get vaccine months every state TN. 

There's reason vaccinated people like wear mask. pandemic us. advice help people work business chose go ""honor system"" (aka masks required)? one concerned new variant hospitalised vaccinated people? No. 

We selfish assholes refused wear mask forcing police them. 

Wear mask needed. 

Don‚Äôt twat‚Ä¶ go bar restaurant Texas, many people aren‚Äôt wearing masks. business requires it, wear it. Always have. put get spot, don‚Äôt hem haw it. Simple. times drawing close. Go get vaccine. Go easy theatrics. don‚Äôt get it, tbh. removes motivation nobody tell! find idea someone might run get vaccinated perplexing. It‚Äôs private companies uphold illegal unenforceable mask mandates. always say 99.9%. ask got number go silent change subject. Vaccine making capacity longer issue. Existing makers could make much supply raw materials better. takes 3-6 months set vaccine line get doses, opinion it‚Äôs better expand current production lines fragment resources. Agreed. got first dose 2nd day opened everyone 16+. I‚Äôm still 2 weeks past 2nd dose tomorrow. Seems silly lifting mask mandates hasn‚Äôt enough time everyone‚Äôs immunity kick in. Start June would reasonable IMO. 

And something CDC knows, data people vaccinated, know 10s millions haven‚Äôt reached full immunity yet. mandatory measles vaccination Germany, skip vaccine cases like yours. need doctor confirm severe Trypanophobia. one reddest areas Florida people mostly wear masks inside stores required them. probably store policy saw like 4 masks total week outside stores. think grocery stores essentially away mask policies bigger step people never red area life think. know mods wouldn‚Äôt consider clip Outbreak quality content. hurts heart. Oh, typical 'if take vaccine would lived' mentality.

On another note, imagine outrage^(TM) people would government said going mandate everyone wash hands frequently? would anti-handwashing subs reddit pop day.

In USA, dont luxury many people. dont paid sick days many jobs, people still need live life: grocery shopping, etc. many people live alone. ...And children.

None surges particularly harmful children. expect new one would be? see heart issues single functioning kidney? I'm medically trained, think still vaccinated. US, maybe could try calling local health department advice. Also, can't get J J, Pfizer good, got almost side effects, I'm neither young healthy. could wrong, least US, vaccines supposed free.

Yes. year later soon.  asked dad finally get vaccinated now, said perfectly fine keeping mask on. mom COVID never got guess thinks indestructable. üôÉ someone trusted mask mandates since beginning, I'm starting think may enough vaccinated + infected make less effect. States like TX restrictions lifted really significantly worse many states restrictions left. Yep - fact flu pretty much completely disappeared year huge conspiracy involving every hospital, doctor's office, medical laboratory every city every state every country world.

That's obviously simple explanation ""masks social distancing work""  287 children died, vast majoirty teenagers. 30 million cases. communism vaccines Fully vaccinated. POV - cost wearing mask standing directly top people public virtually nil, I'll continue take reasonable precautions.

The reasonable takeaway flu season wearing masks, washing hands, staying away people (especially ill) pandemic works really well preventing widespread influenza.

My conclusion cultures wear masks public flu season right idea, feel kind dumb thinking before. Mask-wearing normalized US prior COVID, makes sense considered it. doctor? studies done long term effects fucking terrifying probably know serious rise kawasaki syndrome children covid. plenty studies people get routinely tested regardless vaccination status job (like work healthcare) fact quite rare vaccinated people test positive even without symptoms. That‚Äôs CDC declared safe vaccinated people go maskless. depend federal, state local regulations establish least baseline safety driving, right? Like society, we‚Äôve collectively decided minimum things keep everyone little safer. Obviously keep child safe she‚Äôs baby.

Vaccines 100% efficient, vaccinate enough population it, cases decrease point able find somebody take virus from. pandemic choke.

That's true even (significant) part population vaccinates, well distributed, large groups (i.e. school children) completely unvaccinated. Pepperidge farm remembers. Yes.

This dumb question.

We know, example, unsafe contract COVID-19.

And know CDC made many policy decisions made containment harder.

Literally entire pandemic series errors made CDC. also common sense. Covid somehow spreading person person beach park would make first widespread illness human history so. understand erring side caution, always ridiculous think Covid going different every bug recorded history somehow transmit guy beach chair 20 yards wind sun. failure messaging disservice society children particular closing parks playgrounds beaches. obvious since 2nd 3rd quarter 2020.

Once obvious Covid airborne, common sense prevailed - spreads places every cold flu does.

Yeah bad go back real world everyone look realize much hate again, eh? local Home Depot Walmart yesterday, happy see vaccinated people without mask, especially higher risk older overweight folks.

I'm familiar procedures. guy sham. also legalizing marijuana suddenly 60% Americans agreed made sense suddenly overnight ""revisited data"". joke, CNN personality. one care thinks. vaccinated people safe none reasons justify making people continue wear masks. believe scientists said it‚Äôs safe vaccinated people wear masks.

Again, that's scientists said, despite continuing claim that. Scientists said safe vaccinated people wear masks concern unvaccinated family's transmission risk. Sure. good run. got Thank taking time comment, read using context discover discussion whether ‚Äúwe ever wore protective gear inflict sickness others‚Äù. Germany students required measles vaccine show proof infection.

That's quite right. law since last year says kindergarten children schoolchildren must vaccinated measles. compulsory school attendance Germany children vaccinated still allowed visit schools. Schools allowed deny education. parents might get fines though, obstinate anti-vaxxers pay continue refuse vaccinate kids. 

Kindergartens though admit unvaccinated children. compulsory school attendance apply them, right obligation refuse unvaccinated kids. helps already lot convince parents get children vaccinated measles. hardcore anti-vaxxers keep kids home bring grandparents something similar. think frustration surrounding benefitting unvaccinated people less cutting line allowing virus mutate potential variants existing vaccines may protect against. sub taken selfish route back early January. Even going end last year, general comments (and highly upvoted comments) reflected lot anti-mask/vax views opposite earlier pandemic. Lets see unpackage total moron.

Third, corona viruses notorious mutators. eventually lead variants virus essentially ""bunker busters"" vaccine. eventually lead worse version virus (see spanish flu reoccurrence) lead worse shutdown first. people selfish wear fucking mask public.

All ashamed yourselves. good old fashioned logic. masks keeping businesses shut down, fucking abhorent knobs were., refuse read ANYTHING written CNN. infotainment best liars worst. 

I need CNN's hot take event written end goal scaring masses clicks. Pfizer makes us stock market thought lmao. 

Lets get bread hundred died shutdowns, masking, distancing, well less contagious potentially harmful variants. 

It seems like everyone‚Äôs plan pretend like pandemic over. fast spread unknown. I'm concerned. take whatever precautions need. Personally, opinion, future flu seasons - rather stay home physical distance sick. Plus, imagine many health conditions deaths could prevent people healthier

No one agree - live free society least supposed Genuine curiosity, I'm trying start fight anything, open question. virus contagious SARS-Cov-2 had, say, 90% mortality rate. we're talking basically humanity-ending disease. vaccine virus like that, think vaccination mandatory prevent vaccine-proof mutations? so, would draw line (presumably based mortality rate virus). 

Again, genuine question. I'm guessing lot people would different opinions it.  Uh, every American overseas military mate. Eloquently put.

I‚Äôll rebut with:

Lmao what? Yes. Thanks. There‚Äôs several statements effect kids face less severe symptoms terms risk death well symptoms. time:

‚ÄúThey also anxious chronic long-term effects, like potential neurological cardiac damage. murkier area ‚Äî arguably best case treating Covid exposure different flu exposure. reason scientists use term ‚Äúnovel coronavirus‚Äù describe virus: It‚Äôs new. don‚Äôt yet know eventual effects be.‚Äù

I understand everything level risk it‚Äôs matter trying find right balance problem doesn‚Äôt right answer. personally, I‚Äôve made choice let 6 year old play soccer traditional person schooling benefits outweighed risks. try avoid bringing grocery stores, handful times it‚Äôs necessary, I‚Äôve taken precautions can. risk outweighed benefit. 

There‚Äôs levels risk weigh whether benefits outweigh risk. instance shutting businesses? point, I‚Äôd say given info vaccination rates. comes trying best protect kids, basically folks wear mask indoors, doesn‚Äôt seem like large sacrifice. hear lot ‚Äúcovid dangerous flu‚Äù may well true, unlike flu, kids don‚Äôt option get vaccinated. that‚Äôs case, personally risk vs benefit analysis, I‚Äôm going little bit sacrifice far taking proper precautions reduce risk group people can‚Äôt get vaccinated means helps us get closer day things get less back normal. happened people?

What another disease killed 1 kid year, vaccine 100% prevented it. Would expect whole world continue restrictions prevent one death hundreds things cause many deaths? wouldn‚Äôt.

This similar example. chance kids dying COVID statistically small need restrictions. kid likely die hundred things continue let kid yet expect world keep restrictions cause death statistically insignificant.

The problem is, people conditioned fear COVID much can‚Äôt think logically rationally true risk COVID kids. 65+, 100% worried. you‚Äôre 12 under, million things dangerous fucking COVID... policy even COVID Red lights 100% full proof either.

They start Stage 2 trials release next year goes well. ""One men severely sick COVID-19 spent two weeks hospital recovered, otherwise free chronic health problems.

There‚Äôs defeating it. It‚Äôs airborne virus. That's absolutely shameful daycares part.

The reality won‚Äôt long term data while, unfortunately public health waiting forever isn‚Äôt option. point variant data likely going true long time. expect variants emerge ongoing way. Especially large immunologically naive population worldwide.

I'm little peeved trip planned Japan spring 2020 got cancelled due Covid. flight credit, waiting go, can't go Covid control. 

The event going rescheduled November, feel confident control then. hoping event gets rescheduled happen without us able attend. dont know mean. point was, univacinnate people wearing mask puts rest us risk, miss it. facts unvaccinated people wearing mask put others risk point, put risk.  Same. suburban Chicago, say like 98% compliance, last time last weekend. Going forward? Ehhhhhh, see. Masks far protect others wearer protect person wearing it. think it‚Äôs fair communicate relevant facts people acting irrational way anxiety. Unnecessary masking negatively effects hearing impaired rely part lip reading communicate others. also negative effect little kids still trying learn social cues might benefit seeing others‚Äô facial expressions. (And don‚Äôt get started English second language. Seeing lips facial expressions absolutely help bridge language gaps you‚Äôre struggling understand person saying). least ‚Äúharm‚Äù done others wearing mask isn‚Äôt necessary. 

In areas masking social norm, continuing mask isn‚Äôt necessary might spur culture unnecessary masking (if everyone around still masks up, might feel weird wearing one even safe so). might perpetuate harms. 

Should anti-mask mandate banning masks? Absolutely not. kindly logically explain relevant facts someone reacting fear anxiety, might able persuade them. people said governments power citizens wanting recant even pandemic ends ""conspiracy theory"". No, basically kills risk go hospital. still get really sick point needing hospitalized. Remember, JandJ 63% effective stopping severe disease. means people get really sick enough go hospital. Like kids.... happens forcefully install democracy nation majority illiterate. literally worked job Target CT. resume activities without wearing mask staying 6 feetapart, except required federal, state, local, tribal, orterritorial laws, rules, regulations, including local business andworkplace guidance.

The CDC's website literally says this. advice literally ""vaccinated people need wear masks"". Guy 1) votes color sky 2) issue masking pandemic really big problem experts one unanimously conceded vaccinated people spread virus. us decided get vaccinated, recommending governments continue compel us keep masks sole purpose incentivizing unvaccinated well. free society works. 

We keep people road people refuse wear seat belt. make illegal friend groups go bars might encourage addict bunch relapse. Instead, encourage communities teach us dangers reckless driving addiction well people engage behaviors helped. equivalent driving safely abstaining alcohol exists vulnerable people (vaccination), totally unreasonable experts expect masking treated differently. I'm surprised, Connecticutien single store I've visited relaxed mask mandates yet.

There‚Äôs literally one kid study. 62% least one dose, incredibly effective preventing hospitalization death (and fact science/uk lessons suggest second dose occur lot later month anyways). 82% seniors protected well.

A group Greece reviewed latest literature immune-modulator agents found reduction thrombotic events. think non-specific immunosuppressants, doesn‚Äôt appear targeted anti-inflammatory agents immunomodulatory anything risk thrombotic risk. people wearing masks indefinitely people going resume full participation largely service based economy. 

This absolutely negative economic consequences extent reactions due misinformation vaccine efficacy, need fix this. Unfortunately don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs legal. choose hire unvaccinated employees don‚Äôt think fire someone won‚Äôt get it. Wrongful termination something ask life safer, asked life risk free?

Masks consideration others abundant here, people assholes. times I've ventured outside city attitudes way different. think helps city touches Massachusetts. China 3 different vaccines, 'sino' names result lot confusion. Also Seychelles vaccinated AstraZeneca well.

Now, August 1st stupid start, I‚Äôm annoyed waiting week half. said now, weekend would probably hectic lack prep time. I‚Äôm business local leader want follow cdc advice don‚Äôt see require unvaccinated mask without requiring everyone.

If require everyone wear masks, breaking CDC advice said vaccinated people need wear masks.

I find odd think using literal CDC's advice (vaccinated people need wear masks unvaccinated people do) somehow ""not following CDC's advice"". literally following it, anti-vax people suck. businesses following CDC's advice, individuals following it.  wonder number vaccinated people form enough barrier protect unprotected next possible wave, guess we'll see. Well, CDC inept full idiots know I've worked studied many years past... referring actually idiots society anti-mask debunked long time ago.

Probably last incentive would try motivate people like him, one reason would motivate people get vaccinated. Virtually asymptomatic transmission (more date u/Xenasis post below):   would force us wear masks forever.  Children make very, small fraction covid deaths, something like ~1500 ~550,000 covid deaths US children (i.e. 18). Yes, 1500 lot dead kids, I‚Äôm pretty sure covid doesn‚Äôt even rank top ten causes death children. 

In words, don‚Äôt worry kids getting covid unless underlying health conditions exacerbated covid. state allows teens old 15 get vaccinated without parent consent. might look rules area. 7-day rolling average daily deaths **steadily** decreasing

Now risky populations vaccinated start opening kids eventually able get vaccine.

We've year now. CDC says safe stop. say experts say.

We need wear masks store protect group least likely get virus. vaccine never deemed safe 12s? never stop wearing masks store?

Asian countries people decades. symptoms, mask selfish rude. country make 2 years old wear masks???!! Exactly. tens thousands people UK get hospitalised one go, we'll reimpose restrictions. cases, chance happening. Unless virus mutates become less lethal, vaccines improve, cases kept down. care get treated like Qshaman got vaccinated stopped wearing mask outside legal so.

Is problem anywhere? feel like people stopped telling people without masks put masks started assaulting people it. state: waits weeks end mask mandate.

Smart person online: ‚Äúdamn, communism me‚Äù Ask election  vaccination protect person 100% (ICU/ death)

Which leads believe CDC little secret sharing: believe enough vaccinated people + natural immunity community everyone unmasked, rate transmission would still 1 covid still die slowly US. Pretty much starting see affects level herd immunity.

Obviously CDC want say want encourage people still get vaccinated thats hidden message taking this. 

I dont want say unvaccinated people ""fully protected"" herd immunity yet getting level protection immunity community. cases get super low levels, unvaccinated pretty much fully protected decent level spread.

Yes, asked child vaccination apparently one needs look MIS-C see there‚Äôs huge threat. sure enough, data proves otherwise. too! flu, allergies, anonymity don‚Äôt care others think. It‚Äôs terrifying it‚Äôs true  Also, Uruguay (article spanish), even tough 30% vaccinated time, suggesting people two doses quit using masks: vaccines used Uruguay effective mrna vaccines used states. Chile may similar position:

[Article infect√≥logo Julio Medina sostiene que, diferencia de lo que se promueve en EEUU, los uruguayos est√° en condiciones de dejar el tapabocas a√∫n vacunados por la alta circulaci√≥n del virus porque la vacuna Sinovac es menos efectiva que del m√©todo de ARN""

""The infectologist Julio Medina maintains that, unlike promoted US, Uruguayans position leave masks still vaccinated due high circulation virus Sinovac vaccine less effective RNA method""

Sinovac's Coronvac uses inactivated virus. already public figures two doses also got virus 15 days second dose.  point exactly word impossible used, also cdc saying ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt know vaccinated spread covid‚Äù would REALLY appreciate it. You‚Äôre really fired interpreting cdc‚Äôs recommendations, I‚Äôd love clarity point view. don‚Äôt think so. probably 6 months soon.  states open months vaccination behind, didn‚Äôt see increases cases, hospitalizations, deaths. (They also good weather outdoors, whole country we‚Äôre reaching summer.) kind complications? odds get something serious low, talking fever minor things like that? know helps spread flu? 
Masks. Meijer, Kroger still (in Michigan afaik least. Can‚Äôt say stores/states). agree don‚Äôt want kids getting it. keep making point disagree.

The disagreement level risk acceptable start imposing inconvenient regulations others. likelihood child develops life-long debilitating issues grocery store around unmasked people point time? Indoor dining open every single state trust science, don‚Äôt trust sizeable population doesn‚Äôt lie, possibly contributing mutations could become resistant vaccine adds another layer logic.. exactly!    Anti masters overlap anti vaxers pretty heavily

Maybe that's true US. UK there's fair amount anti-mask sentiment, almost anti-vax attitudes.  Yet another person entirely unaware thing called long covid affect people symptoms zero data vaccines directly protecting against. mRNA vaccines target spike protein, extremely unlikely mutation still recognizably SARS-COV-2 also evades vaccine protection ever develop.

""This could happen, take extraordinary steps avoid it"" good way setting public policy. Oh come know already mandating masks worn face versus vaccine injected body comparable. places mandating vaccines. Like colleges. right. guess I'll fired. wish would stop using words like ""effective"". Efficacy binary. vaccines provide significant protection. riding cars. Let's not. interesting question tho. imagine lot people say favor, follow it. Agreed points. Wife 2 kids (16 18) fully vaccinated two 6. reason us worry covid anymore, statistically speaking. good news! They're good track. wish could Canada. wonder they're getting vaccines? 100 percent protected severe illness. people hurt unvaccinated people without masks lying vaccination status be...other unvaccinated people without masks lying vaccination status. 

Kids immunocompromised people can't yet get vaccinations obviously still need wearing masks (or better yet, staying indoor areas risk covid transmission highest). 

Masks effective. vaccines highly effective. small chance could catch covid even mask/vaccine, probably less chance die car crash way grocery store. Chemo therapy immuno compromised people killed easily flu, someone pneumonia. whole world going wear masks risks eliminated.
While we‚Äôre need make cars, fast food, snacks illegal kill even people.
Maybe even make illegal exercise. really provide guidance, policy. states take guidance make policy. CDC say such-and-such safe, such-and-such safe, really carrot stick thing. most, enough data support it, CDC could indicate would safe vaccinated wear masks 50% population vaccinated. that's data showed, think there's particular cutoff supported data.

A state could taken latest CDC guidance issued mandate felt good policy, happened think reasons would difficult. Great comment, ObsidianBlackbird666. insightful opinion. think that? massive slowdown last summer October, right back up? 

Why areas low vaccination rates see.. another boom, like last October? 

What's keep coming back areas? You‚Äôre fist sentence lie. Jfc.

And fuck homeless people existing. people awful.

How trust science vaccines? They‚Äôre opening everything 1 month universal eligibility. That‚Äôs sensible. 

Wineries? would winery need shut down? buy wine social distance. wish believed genuinely think quite serious. taxis ubers. car still wear mask get place business.  what? ok, that's cost Well depends. you‚Äôre outside clustered tightly together others, say concert, that‚Äôs clearly outside park forest preserve alone. Even Fauci said protests outside last year safe.

We really need stop mindset:
inside = safe, 
outside = perfectly safe

This clearly isn‚Äôt true circumstances. fair, looking infection, hospitalization, death rates children 16 reveal similar story. never risky problem vast, vast, vast majority children. worth talking about. \*will\* SARSIII Covid2X come from? cannot know happened yet. 

I aware good reason encourage trafficking wild bats. BSL-IV protocols invented reasons. Yeah kid parent interactions always emotionally drain unnoticeably Yea mine said 2 million children got 1.3% hospitalized. 26k. .1% died 200. saw 250 somewhere else I've saying that. Either way pretty obvious risk kids super low, kinda crazy much fear people trying spread it. Either people want leave houses big astroturfing campaign. You‚Äôre getting downvoted according CDC, true. weren‚Äôt kids wear masks stay home regular flu season, doesn‚Äôt make sense now. less risk covid regular seasonal flu. I'm going post since think CDC looking forward well. again, tend shortsighted preliminary testing, many infected working zone airport received flights high-risk countries, including South Asia. Several tested positive B.1.617 variant first detected India, World Health Organization said might contagious versions coronavirus.e Friday. health officials said 28 airport workers became infected, 19 fully vaccinated either Pfizer Moderna vaccines, two approved use Singapore. airport outbreak began 88-year-old member airport cleaning crew fully vaccinated tested positive virus May 5. Co-workers became infected later visited airport food court, transmitted virus customers, officials vulnerable across globe going get vaccinated. 

Yeah, two three years. then. (BTW, pharmaceutical industry circling wagons make sure one infringe patents vaccines artificial shortage prevail.) 

Have following what's going India South Asia last month? dead bodies floating rivers wood burn corpses.

Like, werent wearing one pandemic risking many others‚Äô well being, wtf wearing one affect others? don‚Äôt think two compared like it‚Äôs thing, all. People died anti maskers, nobody gonna die people masking up. Oh science tell you? CDC said vaccinated people don‚Äôt need wear masks, mandates left discretion state leaders...where contradiction this? everyone wants vaccine able get one yet. Makes sense me:

CDC releases guideline takes account idiocy mankind, tout CDC.

CDC releases guideline US's plentiful morons already misinterpreting, think CDC full crap. accidentally type vaccination ticket number someone else already reserved. Congratulations, apparently still make reservation whoever made reservation first number cancelled!

If easy pull someone else's ticket simple typo, sounds like ticket numbers easily-guessed sequential digits rather random alpha-numeric strings. That's literal rookie programmer mistake. raise lot good/valid points, necessarily disagree that's mentioned earlier totally understand parents concerned. 

I'm probably little optimistic things federal / state government help protect younger children well parents, navigate time minimal negative impact children's lives possible. Huh? freeway live reduced 45 reduce amount deaths happen there. Never seen rational adult problems that. Hey man (or ma‚Äôam), makes feel safer keep wearing mask keep wearing it. I‚Äôm vaccinated I‚Äôll probably carrying mask around weeks case. wouldn‚Äôt worry anti-vaxxers, they‚Äôve proven year you‚Äôd better conversation wall. science going keep evolving this, gets point feel safe going maskless whatever makes comfortable. Dr.Landon said, repeatedly, know data poor. disagreement point among experts. one saying said Dollar General morning (West Virginia) woman behind family mask hand, cashier pulled chin checked us family masks Since comment removed blunt lol... Texas, guy helped prolong pandemic state (no politics involved, guy ignored science). would "" Nice!"" true. Autopsies rarely given easily drs signing Corona, switched back normal causes use. Also political climate, ""Need"" Rush Back normal greatest guy Texas. Personally trust anyone unfamiliar autopsy/cause death process. Good targ√©t keep feeling people lowkey enjoy spreading illness others it. That's antimasking agenda's surface. people kinda like that. worry stay home continue masking, me? I'm definitely going mask big movies start finally coming out. I'm ready actually enjoy Summer yeae

Still waiting hear literally anybody sub immunocompromised live get lives back it‚Äôs always ‚ÄòJust stay home wear mask forever.‚Äô 
 
Because nobody answer, nobody cares. 'the UK' much government scientists;  counterpoint choose vaccinate west mask spread it, already that.

My counter point even difficult make sure unvaccinated people wear masks vaccinated people allowed go around without unless want start much harder type enforcement beyond enforcing people wear masks begin need wear mask vaccinated children home.

If. leaving children home? largely illegal wide age arguing masks. already said wear mask still. I'm arguing follow CDC guidelines rather guessing.

Except aren't. Following CDC guidelines would include enforcing unvaccinated people wear masks. arguing against. laws?

Any laws require compliance health mandates statues. There's many laws put place ensure health public. change state state. ""Following CDC advice literally insurrectionist!""

lmfao need help I'm forty taking night classes. classmates 20s. fourteen us, one got vaccinated. others act like invincible well. #1 think there's moisture outside mask think aerosol air, done research. #2 think air (in out) get around gaps outer edge mask, again, done research. worked oil gas industry 31 years time least 200 fit tests masks protected atmospheres immediately dangerous life health. one thing learn. virus size molecule carries sent. smell anything mask virus getting well. side keeps saying ""follow science"". follow science fits certain narrative ignore common sense part science? Stop üêë follows whatever CNN MSNBC tell actually research facts yourself. 50 million children age 12 living us. That‚Äôs 15% population country.

6.8% population age 5. population group include children can't talk walk. age group independent outside without supervision parent guardian. parents typically let strangers get close kids age particular portion population particularly good spreading disease 

Well I'm glad focusing one thing (covid) already shown kids lower chance transmission age groups. guarantee breath air, touch objects children daily

I spend time office literally zero children here. right, breathe air. get warmth sun. airplane passed home probably heard children. Oh yeah planet live also occupied children. don‚Äôt spread disease don‚Äôt see them‚Äù

I meant average adult. silly now. teacher administrative staff school contact kids. Pediatricians care children. tell percentage workforce accounts for?  Seems like vaccine they're talking thread Pfizer :/ shame I'm boat Completely closed. example, TripAdvisor page Four Corners monument: photos recent reviews see whole area (in middle desert fully outdoors) completely closed inaccessible. Though I'm sure people posing photos giant closed sign without masks exactly encouraging open it. comparing imposing national speed limit restriction across country (one proven save lives btw, cars got safer too), simply asking people wear mask indoors around unvaccinated people... couple months? Nope. Deaths/hospitalizations continue decline. Socially pandemic July 4th. I'm hoping real truth people want first, start taking masks becomes little common.

That's I'm at. went Trader Joe's weekend totally ready go sans mask, saw literally every single person mask on, put mine too. looking like super conservative, rather really want anybody notice ever want stand bare face store. soon starts become common city, I'll happily take too. country even 50% mark, herd immunity 70-80%

Both vaccinated people immunity prior infection count towards herd immunity. CDC estimates 30% US population infected. scientific doubts Sputnik remerged last week Lancet published paper team scientists drawn Europe, U.S. Russia questioning 2020 study vaccine medical journal published flagging significant discrepancies data phase two three trials conducted Gamaleya Research Institute, vaccine‚Äôs developer.  access data hampers trust research,‚Äù scientists said last week‚Äôs study. ‚ÄúAccess data underpinning study findings imperative check confirm findings claimed. even serious apparent errors numerical inconsistencies statistics results presented,‚Äù said. team included Enrico Bucci Temple University U.S., Gowri Gopalakrishna Amsterdam University Raffaele Calogero University Turin.  reply, scientists Gamaleya Research Institute say data discrepancies occurred typing errors point approval Sputnik 51 countries showing ‚Äúfully transparent comply regulatory requirements.‚Äù

When want win world's trust, want vaccine used ASAP everywhere, blame ""typing errors"" significant discrepancies data provided... benign explanation rushed entire process, hire single copy editor, made mistakes. (And begs question: mistakes make?..)

That is, course, benign possible explanations... state database vaccination information businesses cross reference with. aren‚Äôt vaccines mandatory then? Covid around 3 years everyone wear masks social distance whole time?  Happy help. sure downvoted legitimate question! they're specifically targeting protected class, increased risk lawsuit. I've gone whole year without creepy old asshole telling smile. amazing. I'm wearing mask forever. It‚Äôs misstep vaccinated people wear masks. 

The misstep blaming CDC idiots. certainly wish die, I'll find difficult compassion point. like USA 9/11

Easy understand gov need power emergency, hard get back over. rates infection outcomes highest cloth mask arm, rate ILI statistically significantly higher cloth mask arm (relative risk (RR)=13.00, 95% CI 1.69 100.07) compared medical mask arm. **Cloth masks also significantly higher rates ILI compared control arm.** analysis mask use showed ILI (RR=6.64, 95% CI 1.45 28.65) laboratory-confirmed virus (RR=1.72, 95% CI 1.01 2.94) significantly higher cloth masks group compared medical masks group. Penetration cloth masks particles almost 97% medical masks provided first clinical efficacy data cloth masks, suggest HCWs use cloth masks protection respiratory infection. Cloth masks resulted significantly higher rates infection medical masks, *also performed worse control arm.*** controls HCWs observed standard practice, involved mask use majority, albeit lower compliance intervention arms. control HCWs also used medical masks often cloth masks. analysed mask-wearers including controls, higher risk cloth masks seen laboratory-confirmed respiratory viral infection.

Those conclusions, look data yourself. response tells read slightest, copy pasted part abstract first paragraph discussion.

Second one wrong citation, that's get responding mobile - [This says 287 people age 17 died anecdotally working. talked 4 teachers didnt vaccine say signing now.  Yes. time, they're finding lot non symptom patients much, more, permanent damage covid

Can share link that?  [Thanks! Looks like link says 287 deaths people 17 under. talking 12 under, it'll even less that.  summer heat rethinking things. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Everyone acting like far point still. 4 previously existing endemic coronaviruses seasonal. Covid around year, exploded unseen levels right time expect to, seasonal. Yeah, do. 172 kids died flu Florida 2018. 43 people 24 died Florida covid. Florida school open whole year. worst part flu deaths half deaths healthy kids. many healthy kids died covid comparison? I'm guessing almost 0 keep at-risk kids safe. need mitigation risk small? Nobody mitigates risks tiny, covid special stuff we've never done  Good. sick tired wearing masks. Feel free kids continue wear mask then. That‚Äôs we‚Äôre ours. explain part article saying? I‚Äôm kind unsure it‚Äôs really saying. Obviously says 50% statistic like said, I‚Äôm wondering got data involving SARS MERS. Like obviously get pneumonia acute respiratory distress syndrome, likely permanent lung damage, seems minority people recovered covid. Also couldn‚Äôt find info 50% statistic anywhere else googling bit. got articles explain detail I‚Äôd like read really make best conspiracies someone fired good fit 'for work culture' (as long state follows at-will employment), order properly, HR management needs make case person fitting follow standard termination procedure ensure move goes without hitch. job write three times reason find, show repeated patterns judge apply unemployment people going interact people can't get vaccine due medical reasons. 

This true, usual high risk people stay away people interested keeping safe. reason vaccinated people wear masks though, transmission vaccinated people low. counterpoint choose vaccinate west mask spread it, already safely leaving children home alone. 

They need wear mask vaccinated children never seen someone argue masks ENDANGERS people.

I'm arguing masks. already said wear mask still. I'm arguing follow CDC guidelines rather know, could police military enforce laws instead relying minimum wage workers it. 

That would better. UK would make big difference would actually enforcing laws.

Which laws? Wow. Didnt expect this. huge news. certainly wont affect work (as work school) itll nice parts life. able tell forged? watermarks, nothing securing forgery. ignore it. Stop something government tells to. Yes, unvacinated could not... likely lie.. many could likely die it.
And think there's much way stopping now. might back masks late fall. Societies nationalised heathcare obliged be. That's difference here.  haven‚Äôt reached herd immunity. really think it‚Äôs fair remove masks people trash immune systems can‚Äôt protected herd immunity? Yeah let‚Äôs force stay home even longer ‚Äúthey‚Äôre already used it‚Äù. country could showed care people waiting herd immunity ending masks. Seasonal influenza kills children‚Äôs annually covid significant margin.

The CDC made decision risk children is, according available evidence, extremely low. Case point, flu deadlier mean need expert tell us this? Pretty sure whole world would look article say 'yeah shit'.   Children 12 still wear mask. gonna say. really need experts say? don‚Äôt understand logic comparing two completely different things. It‚Äôs like risks driving aren‚Äôt highly regulated every possible aspect.  India send dead rafts ganges time people bath river seen holy.

Ita shame I'm honest hope everyone India access vaccination coronavirus. true patriot, blind stupidity empathy. ones danger? i'd let enjoy life let natural selection take course Funny people claim hate immigrants lying getting benefits lie get benefits. Hmmmm also says website still catch virus give others immunosuppressed people. OK guess know better reading summarizing statement. reason put encourage people get vaxed. Except people getting vaccines first place going CDC guideline checked. Seriously? believe bridge sell you. thanks Ill keep wearing mask non believing vax community gets smaller.  news ... . People without bullet proof jackets risk running around hail bullets. /r/awardspeechedits last year, stock 20% cut dividend zero laid 20% staff?

&amp;#x200B;

In case, point disney make money ditching masks thats   wife says people wearing masks still aren‚Äôt vaccinated. still wear masks. Let 'em go. rest us respecting science. figured now, let 'em go. necessarily ventilators causing deaths, rather ventilators helpful COVID expecting, virus causes lot systemic damage outside lungs. can't even get people comply masking rule everyone needs wear mask. hell going police vaccinated? cousins I'm like 99 percent sure this. started think training them, think liked able take dog everywhere. first got one said emotional support, husband well. I'm super close them, yeah definitely could problem, also bring things would inconvenient. think like able tell people can't stop taking dogs buildings. relevant? know cars pools highly regulated. It‚Äôs dangers cars pools young children ignored? That's Taiwan did. pretty much trick (until recently, they're dealing spreading outbreak - tiny levels, year West did.) Thank you. 
I've planning get J&amp;J, way 1 done overthink shots risk chickening out.
I call schedule it. I‚Äôm son 10. I‚Äôll wear one wherever to. Lolol lolllolllllllllooooolllllolllloll Im expert liar. People lie. Children 12 opportunity opportunity them. 

Vaxxed mom cannot wait 4 year old able get vaccine.  Seems like assuming quite lot people thinking. Besides, shaming people makes defensive. better approach assume they‚Äôll get eventually give little space. month get board topic old news. third Americans

And rural areas, proportionally much, much higher.  mean mathematically it‚Äôs pretty negligible. amount people lying would small horde immunity effective enough Okay, year similar, go back way used be, problem.

Luckily them, Doctors first group offered vaccine. worry all. can't stay forever, like legally...most using emergency orders bound see legal challenges longer stay place.

The simplest thing would tie lifting mask mandates vaccination rates, nothing more, nothing less.

Even got 60% fully vaccinated nationwide, issues kids vaccinated, anti-vaxxers, possible variants? problems would still keeping widespread mask mandates would solve them. EVIDENCE!!!

/s

I‚Äôm disappointed widespread science denial sides apparently. People shown manner reports findings don‚Äôt personally jive it, doesn‚Äôt count. Common sense* ignore threat covid flu worse (assuming that‚Äôs accurate year flu- makes think Covid harder stop flu)- makes zero sense me? number dead children CDC accepting giving advice? don‚Äôt understand it. Yeah get also look grandmother unofficially. Humans selfish rationalized saying protecting family. Fuck ‚Äòem Honestly, cares?

&amp;#x200B;

In US, want vaccine get free, everywhere. I'm vaccinated much risk all. Go spread around amongst denialist, conspiracy theorists chronically dumb. Drink merry die sooner later. much sooner others. said gyms closed? point plenty unvaccinated people wear masks. US, they're giving us cards, least state. Nothing digital I've seen far. ""I don‚Äôt want told do.‚Äù

People conned believing rather agency actually case. us spend lives told do, good community, good. Certainly times push back make voices heard - rejecting vaccines one times.

Sadly lot anti vax (and anti mask etc) simply people trying live false sense agency incalculated (in order sell things - act buying becomes agency). People lie?? Get fuck outta here! Good take. way let antivaxxers come around let start dying removing covid protections. way, either antivaxers die run get vax stay safe, get covid recover. get herd immunity one way another. option keep begging get deal bullshit restreictions forever Welcome sub. may new studies vaccine efficacy posted multiple times per day come out. data evolving even scary variants stopped existing vaccines. Cases less half month ago US.

There studies show current deaths unvaccinated people vaccinated people old.

I yet see study says vaccinated people (symptomatic asymptomatic) driving cases. 

What kind studies need, time traveler future? best data far vaccines 9x% effective what's scientific basis forcing vaccinated people wear mask? Yay censoring people bad words. Good god.  Insane wrong. data weird long (consistent reporting, massive jump, long pause virtually doses) latest dump icing cake. inconsistency red flag number one data may wrong. 

The new data says 85% population received first dose. would 98-99% eligible population (including 12-15) approved Thursday. red flag number two. 

The third final red flag data shows consumed 120% allocated supply. yes, scrape extra dose there, getting 120% doses supply, especially spoilage increased significantly priorities shifted wasting doses getting doses arms. 

Their numbers revised point data right. 

Unfortunately that's good today's numbers primarily supported New Hampshire's data dump. Without it, moving average would ticked noticeably. Lol you‚Äôre clearly abled body person. year similar normal lives. Many disability don‚Äôt work. stay home lot. Many wear masks flu season. Many accommodations provided everyone year disabled people people chronic conditions fighting years. hard thing year put medical appointments months many Americans selfish caused Covid spread needed to.

You said want shame anyone continues wear mask includes many people already live severe health issues clearly didn‚Äôt think about. stupid. exactly, countries staying top covid using strict quarantine. Thats youre number 1 best solution pandemic

Then vaccinate. looking like countries avoid brunt covid reopening Right, lots people did, I'm moral police- every vaccinated person one less vector. 

But lot people waited till eligible, and/or walk appointments. detached reality already know people lie. Dipshits literally paying vaccine card‚Ä¶ weren't. Doesn‚Äôt take expert   I'm concerned about. Currently theres kind peer pressure go store majority people mask on. purposefully make one stands draws attention decide wear mask. going mostly opposite.

Also, remember that, we've progressing nicely vaccination numbers, we're still 60% population one dose somewhere mid-30%s fully vaccinated. fact vaccinated people probably dont need masks isnt new information, country point get rid mask mandates yet. Hopefully look back comment months laugh dumb was, personally think we're getting complacent watch cases go jumping gun here. read something rushing region like Bolton, least sounds solid plan putting effect. asked ‚Äúwhy mask mandate‚Äù?? 

Because people unwilling follow guidelines ‚Äúsocial distance wear mask‚Äù without explicitly stated would consequences following recommendations. 

Exactly saying 30 minutes ago. 

ETA: anti-maskers haven‚Äôt wearing mask months anyway. change doesn‚Äôt really much anything except allow vaccinated responsible individuals return sense normal.  would good everyone tell truth! think people going lie vaccinated never taken virus seriously much likely infected already. enough hosts left us get another wave point unless one variants proves evade vaccine protection. Um didn‚Äôt say anti vaxxers pro mask. I‚Äôm saying people vaccinated wear mask. Even people pro vaccine may finally received vaccination within last couple days wear mask. Even do, masks protective preventing virus leaving entering. Btw people vaccinated still get covid. still areas still good amount community spread. certainly breakthrough cases there. seen vaccinated people already. CDC knows original guidance say vaccinated people gather other. recently still telling vaccinated people mask up. simply trying get others vaccinate keep hearing people complain saying whats point getting vaccine still wear mask. way stopping covid. spreads easily. could kept numbers lower. even every country working together (which happen) stamped out. already way widespread even realized normal flu. standard still 2 weeks final dose, 2 weeks J J two weeks second Moderna Pfizer.

And yes, antibodies kick sooner, world would wait last two weeks? spike 1 yard line? I'm 28 English first jab illnesses reasons earlier people people surgery around age like 10 people leaving every 5 minutes.    üòÇstop embarrassing Didn‚Äôt need ‚Äúexpert‚Äù tell that.
Of course people lie. point though vaccines available US long time proven effective, really don‚Äôt give shit someone else gonna lie whether they‚Äôre vaccinated really need experts determine this? People lying ‚Äúmedical condition‚Äù prevents wearing mask entire pandemic. skipped line accident. real grandma piece work. left grandpa children moved 1,000 miles away like 20 years even born, met maybe twice kid. guess went period guilt one year sent us Christmas card never done entire inside filled personal message. went bad life health getting worse best part said blood pressure something ridiculous like 250 500 know much longer gonna make it, although somehow still alive I'm surprised made mailbox blood squirting ears.

I also ""friend"" growing lied time make seem cooler. would lie weirdest stuff everyone could easily see lying, like one time told us grandpa 5 racecars 50 horses farm even though we'd grandpas farm like maybe 10 cows pigs. People pretty fucking weird lol. would think infections among healthcare workers essential workers would even odds infected distribution probably isn‚Äôt far even percentages vaccinated vs non vaccinated groups. like... people supposed COVID? Hide room day measles whooping cough flu whatever? Can't go back that? No. expect get vaccine protect themselves, friends, family, fellow denizens America world. scientists determined current best solution. zero burden preventing so. believe people getting vaccine right thing morally. Given vaccine availability. think safe say don‚Äôt care. hold long others follow suit. Unless wearing respirator wearing properly (and rest hygiene stuff around hands) relying spread reduction property masks worn sick people, mask protecting catching something. once, wanting part cool crowd good thing. America shit advice like this. blame them. Blame dummies. don‚Äôt know you‚Äôre kidding, really don‚Äôt want breathing dry cleaning solution. Smallpox probably deadly disfiguring. Plus humans throughout history everyone culturally weary it. hard argue vaccination. People try, hard believed.

COVID recent, could asymptomatic many people. doubt anything needs done, amplified social media. covid endemic either way. places herd immunity achieveed lower cases deaths I‚Äôm boat. Even husband fully vaccinated says still wants wear mask. fairness he‚Äôs introvert.  CDC recommendation stop wearing mask everywhere. fact you‚Äôre calling people post sissies wearing masks says lot insecurity. realize that, right? Mister manly man Serious anti-vaxxers maybe 5-10 percent population. Seems like social media fake world. real world, people going slowly realize vaccinated friends coworkers happier looking forward future. slowly join party.  amongst first change always toughest, worth it. people nervous due social pressure appreciate paving way. True, basically J&amp;J numbers 2 weeks first dose. People shitty. lie. I've (reluctantly) around lot babies. Never life parent asked tdap flu shot. sister baby last year, right covid, even hospital asked us went meet newborn addition. Well, goes last shred possibility thought let on. could waiting second dose... Patiently waiting stories start ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need reduce risk something I‚Äôm already 99.7% safe from‚Äù develop ‚ÄúAbout put ventilator. wish took vaccine chance. thing joke people.‚Äù  cool Lmao fuck thinking made decision? whole point masks everyone wear protects others. Yes protection wear it, others needs wear too. reality young kids right get go things. Even vaccine available *should* able go soon, there's cloud hanging every time take out. 

Will catch it? Probably not. might, fault? little bit, knew still there. mainly fault ***selfish assholes cowards unwilling smallest possible thing make world better anyone else.*** That's heard said. clearly said vaccinated people go maskless. unfortunate us made morons. problem see people coming rural areas city. live one vaccinated percentage cities country surrounded sea denialists... supposed bring comfort people going stream cities socializing possibly spreading it? also live person co-morbidities basically screwed due lack trusting public calls fake.... We'll get faster vaccinated remove masks. I'd rather everyone take masks f means get 10% vaccinated month vs dragging summer. would assume middle age white people anti maskers? sounds racist. outlined 2 3 concerns - human behavior mutations, especially 40% vaccinated. 

My 3rd concern older pre-pandemic anti-anti-vaxxer piece - concern *can‚Äôt* receive vaccine may allergic immunocompromised. rely herd immunity, they‚Äôre fucked behavior potential variants. 

For people, really expected masks encouraged ‚Äúherd immunity‚Äù achieved - meaning 70-80% population *fully* vaccinated. politically fashionable number shots administered.

And remember masks effective infected non-infected wear them. can‚Äôt say ‚Äúyou‚Äôll fine wear mask can‚Äôt vaccinated.‚Äù people going die they‚Äôre exposed emboldened anti-maskers/anti-vaxxers essential places like grocery stores.  Please post update Monday Johnq. I‚Äôd love hear shot show turns People probably lie it. preexisting medical problems, sure could get vaccine. contacted doctor mine, (meaning specialist plus PCP), given green light get it. receiving shot, observed 20 30 minutes issued card carry stating received vaccine. still wear mask, trying keep getting germs people may spreading. Lol even say country said Asian cultures. That's did. feds even power national mask mandate many already ignoring it. 

If like what's going masks, state. 1920s outbreak strange form encephalitis caused type sleeping sickness, affecting people permanently. seems linked 1918 flu pandemic may long-term effect virus (though connection 100%). recent one post-ebola effects, big one eye problems, even include neurological problems. evidence covid may cause long-term lung damage even asymptomatic people, may see large uptick people breathing issues. cares? I‚Äôm fully vaxxed, anti vaxxers want risk getting fuck em I‚Äôll oblige seems antibodies make robust asthe vaccine.

I don‚Äôt think accurate variant stopped vaccine? Yeah, crazy--this sub gets hit pretty heavily. hey, take opportunity practice courage convictions even unpopular. Check many logical fallacies half-truths people rely on. gets kind absurd sometimes. truly understand list places. subway station different crowded store? important difference, would appreciate explanation. know what's funny. person Target wear mask March 2020, people talking shit walked by. one first wear mask expect thing.

Cops busy giving fines everyone. totally end well....  That's awesome. relief. love "" trust science"" fuckers. science developed points fuckers survived infancy died catching first cold. Complete disregard much modern life due science ""autonomy thinking yourself"" shit think people mix introverted socially awkward here. introverts still want social contact lmao works point. Kids 12 still risk, albeit much smaller risk. 

 they're even smaller risk whooping cough I'd still fucking livid kid got seriously ill bunch sissies stomach little needle prick. boss photoshopping vaccine card want vaccine. says nobody who's vaccinated needs mask, need one. nearly died Covid December. wish person work said this, alas... According local vaccination statistics, least 7/10 adults still wearing masks. see less that, somebody‚Äôs probably lying. SLAPS HOOD  Again, say equivalent. drew analogy two antisocial behaviors social pressure effective against.

Refusing wear mask pandemic treatment vaccine antisocial behavior. one cause people lose lives. right discourage it.

Wearing mask vaccinated believe science also pretty antisocial behavior. bad kill people, also antisocial discouraged. Honestly think masks go soon don‚Äôt really understand bothers people short term. Like get wanting masking 2-3 months said end restrictions June July wouldn‚Äôt really bother much. get idea wanting mask sheer amount anger emotional toll seems take people odd me. think one hate most. Yes, everyone gets symptoms also know long term effects. top that, people dying covid. would anyone want gamble chances? still follow state/county/city law. live NC saw changed sign morning. says masks unvaccinated now, looks almost identical nothing wrong wearing mask... closed last year becuase nothing, becuase mask, opening becuase adequate protection virus mean bad still wear mask. see got it. need level people's viewpoint wanna make policy, many COVID threat. [""Everybody lies"" - Dr. Gregory Shit. I‚Äôm expert guarantee they‚Äôll lie. mean, cares? you, let others them. someone wants antisocial - let them. nothing you. Maybe disagree, that‚Äôs view. point risk opinion

Most high risk groups fully vaccinated deaths already minimized, even one dose group 60-80% protected covid higher effectiveness fatalities vaccinated people.   2 weeks you‚Äôre fully vaccinated. people wearing masks now. mean shedding vaccine, harm them. Win win.

I love wearing mask public. However, I'm vaccine shedder infecting anti-vaccine folks.

The whole point COVID-19 vaccinated wearing masks infect non-vaccinated people population control. part plan. vaccinated people children age 12, catch virus, get best medical treatment. non-vaccinated people going left die well children. research. part plan.  Nah lot walmarts horrifically mismanaged, occams razor Kids 12 asthma. went couple stores today mask. I'm fully vaccinated. Felt weird, like wearing masks beginning did. Felt like getting death stares. sister 21 weeks pregnant planning wait another weeks vaccinate comfort, mask restrictions lifted, looks like won‚Äôt choice start now. everyone liar. bet least 10% eligible hesitant, lie vaccinated believe covid real thing. everyone else's masks going away, they're going get fence go get vaccinated.

Those people key. conspiracy theorists believe covid serious, masks control, vaccines poison going lie. always going get place end. Surprised use impending doom line. worries, came fine. people thinking kids. SOMEONE THINK CHILDREN? Thanks. aligns I've read. means true reduction transmission lower estimate 89.4%,‚Äù McLaren said. ‚ÄúHow much lower? need evidence know sure. expect that, account bias, we‚Äôll still find vaccine reduce transmission. would good news.‚Äù

Less, zero. ""we need analyze"". 

Look, I'm trying contrarian. I'm region work industry laden antivaxxers. I'm personally erring side caution regard returning normal. Want get pandemic without yet another wave. I'm asking bungee else to. 

I'll glad stop wearing masks. really love ppl face face. could social distance forever, tbh. I've loved catching colds past year. people look around see clearly hospitalizations falling like rock following vaccines, whereas rocketing following COVID?

I would love correlation true.

However India pre vaccine era, cases constantly falling without intervention. witnessed sudden tsunami.

If repeat post vaccine conclude efficacy vaccine companies promise. changed yet. work 2 walmarts every day, one changed signs one (roughly 20 miles apart, live rural area). depends store well managed. Right. see ""win-win"" That's right becomes obvious pandemic misery continue non vaccinated be, part, completely vaccinated, penny drop lot more. get it...
 
Are saying *do* get it, like move completely different point? Also, sky blue. People wearing masks can't hurt people!

People wearing masks hurt people! mass collection digitization medical information relatively newish. two issues think are: 1 - privacy, legality security issues surrounding sharing PHI. 2 - companies want make importing exporting external data purposefully difficult ensure hospital organizations stuck using software. got December 2019. never felt terrible entire life. mean even 20-40 percent kids like 4-8 percent population. That‚Äôs negligible Eh, case numbers dropped weeks mandate lifted we're lower numbers time last year. stressing man. numbers even lower many places mandate. Idk youre convinced masks solution problems. Hardly anything changed mandate lifted. never enforced lol. biggest boneheaded idiotic moron could agree say ‚ÄúDuh!‚Äù here‚Ä¶ Let's put stop phrase ""game changer"" well. She‚Äôs Kate Upton, calling nurse picture whale bit much.  They're right. I'm American told everyone going lie say got it, really went got could rub Canadian friends faces.  Wow. One best articles I've read while.  really think someone hasn‚Äôt vaccinated partially vaccinated walks walmart sees hardly anybody mask would also wear mask? socialize people? thing making people wear mask laws mandate them. favor look percent fully vaccinated people compare many don‚Äôt wear masks inside businesses could easily see number vaccinated people far less.
I agree risk vaccinated people lower know far many unvaccinated people. Btw don‚Äôt say people natural immunity wear mask. Several papers show strong immunity natural infection cdc acknowledge this. Also, several papers show one dose needed previously infected people. doesn‚Äôt CDC consider these? Anybody followed cdc since pandemic started understands inconsistent. know, too. thought covid mid March first started. working office training someone coughing storm. told work wasn‚Äôt going could work home didn‚Äôt feel comfortable. Luckily started feel really sick. never could smell well (like eaten spoiled food plenty times without noticing) didn‚Äôt notice loss smell, winded standing going stairs two weeks along mild cough fever. Strangely enough, smell improved vastly month getting sick. getting whatever cured sense smell.

I got vaccinated anyway case. However, tell people get antibody test. don‚Äôt want get vaccinated think it, make sure antibodies it. risk covid based hunch? Absolutely. Vaccines multitudes better mask person 24 hours day. People fearing new guidance used able see complying cdc suggestions look them. mask tangible. hard wrap mind around vaccine way better. Gee...quelle surprise Fourth stimulus check verifiable vaccination card.    scary number anti-vax doctors nurse practitioners there. saw pediatric NP son couple months ago expressed skepticism masks vaccine. also said needed expectorant gave us medicine samples contain expectorant. 

She‚Äôs popular‚Ä¶ said makes zero sense. clear, care people wear masks, said something glad wear mask anymore, I've getting lot negative feedback friends, saying I'm selfish wanting wear mask.  one two non-college kid bars Five Points, Columbia. work retail busy place. Pandemic stress catastrophe horrible medical worries aside, love results wearing mask customers - also washed filthy hands. Limiting capacity also made everything better.

I (and direct staff) much sniffle since last March. Usually 800k+ people get per year give us colds, flu, norovirus, every plague. Even ringworm lice toddler areas.

Add fact Nobody told smile-because I‚Äôm masked cannot police facial expression - year amazing. said combine social distancing. best do. People obviously still cough straight eyeballs.  one super contagious.

So every variant. one would another.

Virus gonna virus. get faster way. hesitant people reason get vaccianted. Wait, 5 year old permanently screaming? Intuition. CDC dropped news overnight us. city like Los Angeles mask wearing wasn‚Äôt issue, it‚Äôs going take people drop habit. 

Like mentioned, predict mask significantly drop June 15th deadline Governor put place met. Blowback  people care point? vax 95% effective. country full selfish pieces shit. Yeah know think that's ideal world long go see superhero movie go McDonalds wear mask.  Lol! gonna say thing beat it. news, people don‚Äôt wipe asses likely smell like shit.  I‚Äôm dude. It‚Äôd interesting see counties cities mandates within Florida done opposed without. Water wet Good, eff 'em, hope get sick die. guess don‚Äôt realize carrot (I.e.

Keep Florida may go pretty solid blue. problem. almost perfect design. plan continue wearing mask quite while, even required, added safety margin. 
 
Excellent cognitive ability, substantial critical thinking skills, ability plan future, good decision making skills = vaccinated + wear mask. 
 
Poor cognitive ability, lacking critical thinking skills, inability plan future, poor decision making skills = vaccinated + mask.

You almost design effective eugenics system tried. Hopefully gene pool shows higher concentration smarts next 5 - 10 years! Went unmasked work today (retail.) employee made choice so, I‚Äôd estimate 80-85% customers masks on. definitely got look two, mostly mom types. wrote ‚Äúfully vaxxed‚Äù ‚ÄúPfizer‚Äôd up‚Äù name tag help ease tensions.

1.	This ignoring immunodeficient people.
2.	This ignoring children literally can't get vaccinated yet. I'm Reddit-or. know saying true. People lie. maybe put small microchip vaccine scan people see lying. what? shot, safe. doesnt matter next guy his. Anyone wants shot get one. dont, take chances. do, youre safe. I'll keep mask on, thanks.  Much love dishwashers, worked kitchens decade. finding someone decent sensibilities willing job like finding unicorn.  Probably govt provided sufficient explanation children?

It literally feels like thrown bus. Remember masks protect mainly others, wearer. Lol fuck comment üòÇ concern isnt efficacy dropping 90% 70%, new strain prove significantly resistant.

This good news story although strains India may resistant vaccines vaccines. Relative vaccines, minor problem still reasonable concern think. Fauci said dont need maks. Whats difference anyway. said could go without. Two coworkers got super sick bronchitis pneumonia Dec 2019, young, healthy people. Covid started, one claiming Covid, wear mask, plus anti-mask stuff spread. So, say it. Why? studies offer evidence claims?  don‚Äôt give stronger likely longer lasting immunity number people don‚Äôt want get vaccine may never reach 70-80%. take chance eventually.  matter lie? They‚Äôre hurting themselves. read deeper it, there‚Äôs pot gold end  don‚Äôt understand issue is. I‚Äôm vaccinated plan taking mask off. someone isn‚Äôt vaccinated doesn‚Äôt want wear mask gets rona dies well tough shit. vaccine long enough anyone wants get it. Nope, wrong. kids die normal flu (which dont care talk about) 1 5000 kids hospitalized, less 1 7800 die. nothingburger. 80% kids dont get sick all. 

&amp;#x200B;

Your kids likely die car crash die illness. But, imagine never hesitate put kids car. Hard one group start wearing them. Hard polar opposite take off. Man thought people would better this. Looking forward June 15th CA drops mandate. ü§©  stupid, liar? know mean, I'm going go ""liar"". think masks people live forever? I‚Äôm almost never Columbia anyway. live Charleston. studies done effective vaccine real world 90% efficacy. rare tested I'm going lie lying vaccine Unvaccinated yes I‚Äôll lie Getting vaccine likely result longer lasting immunity natural infection. know repercussions poor life choices protected free speech.  That's obviously worst part. Hopefully herd immunity comes sooner. going inject something someone would normally cut traffic continue indulge fast food right statement needs major correction: need shut global travel , case unvaccinated. vaccinated.

big BIG difference already, agree? They‚Äôre requiring vaccinated employees wear mask. example, Publix employees longer need wear mask they‚Äôve vaccinated company said must prove vaccination order exempt mask policy. Publix today half people working unmasked. 

I know people want give employer kind information, way it‚Äôs phrased makes seem like they‚Äôre requiring it, cases employee wants exemption current policy. fair. Don‚Äôt want give employer health info? continue mask. Experts correct.

Wearing mask reduces risk little, reduces people's risk lot.

So no, can't wear mask done it. Bro, fuckin preach. Right that. Okay first all, happened, vaccines protect strongly known variants thus far, minor reduction efficacy one two, transmit much less somehow breakthrough.

If variant actually significantly break vaccine‚Äôs protection I‚Äôd probably mask (assuming recommendation scientists) got another vaccine limited risk, would probably happen much faster timeline mRNA vaccines amazing easy tool new variants. 

I wore damn things year dude don't. remember CDC saying one point current point time useful hospital staff masks general public such, since ste seeing shortage already, average joe focus social distancing obtained ppe would useful hospitals help alleviate shortage. one, can't go crowded party wear mask drinks. also can't hook anyone parties wearing mask seeing kissing someone fundamentally opposed idea mouth covered.

J&amp;J arguably one highest risk adverse reactions    Please show results Chinese getting Sinovac.

Meanwhile, efficacy % Chile, Turkey, Indonesia, Brazil jabbing populations (in millions).

Why quiet efficacy? produces sinopharm? number vaccinated people China obscure vaccine get?

Obviously full course yields maximal results lasting immunity, think noted one shot mean one defenseless, anything swear god read one identical article. probably 200 articles exact headline content month Source? Three factors think contributing unmasking hesitancy:

1. People used wearing masks feel weirdly unprotected without them.
2. People want look douchy. Others may think unvaccinated anti-masker unmask.
3. People know CDC guidelines propagated affect local rules. Sure, CDC says okay, unmask, violating state, local, business rules?

Yes, states still mask rules either updated line CDC expressed intention shortly (my state hasn‚Äôt yet updated mandate indicated plans soon). course lie. Duh. Next question!  dont care micro level people wear masks, macro level would like see masking reduced eliminated mainstream culture asap.

Im slightly concerned potential additional mask mandates going forward, case possible covid resurgence particularly bad flu season.

In midst emerging pandemic caused airborne disease know little treatments for? Sure, totally understand mandates, board wore mask.

But part im fan accepting risks come life including disease, case covid resurgence years road bad flu season, im really board public health mandates, worry masking remains super common, could pushes mask mandates among value security personal freedom autonomy cases know combat virus question accurately predict control spread.  someone tell chances vaccinated person spreading covid unvaccinated person. looked CDC‚Äôs website can‚Äôt find anything vaccinated people interact unvaccinated people. sister immune-compromised going chemo various treatments, can‚Äôt get vaccinated right now. relies family get appointments can‚Äôt take (and love want around her) we‚Äôre al hesitant stop wearing masks without knowing 100% chance us spreading something is. Thanks help! need lie, I‚Äôll straight tell still wear it. Breakthrough cases vaccinated symptomatic. Covid likely endemic regardless Proudly fully vaccinated here. I'm also OCD germaphobe. realized much spit other's faces talk other, kind grossed out. know need break habit feed OCD, right now, feel like want wear masks public forever, regardless Covid. knew pandemic expert Saying extremely minimal risk covid vaccine anti vaccination? Saying extremely minimal risk covid vaccine anti vaccination? Oh ok, srry misunderstood exponential take number think lie, multiply itself. Locking link [CDC related breastfeeding:

Do citation? think science obvious while. reason got pushback people angrily insisting people must keep masking post-vaccine science says probably feel like bit goofball now. RIP  Yes, falls study behavioral economics describe manifestation imperfect logic. meat mean yeah course lol. people even able get yet.  Fucking duh Peep username, obvious troll. want see semblance herd immunity fucking work peace.

Herd immunity going help friend, unfortunately... 2nd wave let's gooo read stuff Starbucks sub. Craziness. people want mandates remain better job convincing vaccine hesitant get shots anit vax point. stupid, rule makers, americans? Unfortunately that's true, part problem.

Idiots think got lucky getting infected wearing mask means virus less dangerous half problem. conspiracy theory:
The insurance companies Helm. First used Trump kill old, using Biden kill stupid. leaves healthy people insurance pools, better bottom line.  muh narrative Well that‚Äôs interesting vaccinated person spread vaccinated people. Still good majority asymptomatic people getting sick dying antivaxxxers. public health crisis, natural selection. shot, wearing mask social distancing absolutely zero anyone. WTF big deal wearing masks indoors- don‚Äôt get it- see outdoors- problem wearing 20 minutes focus store shopping mall- helps anyone- I‚Äôm good I‚Äôm fully vaccinated- people lie- I‚Äôve seen already- friends say condition shit like that- sad come Vaccinated people going unmasked likely *directly* cause spread. help anything? far tell, gives license covid-deniers endanger others. lie vaccinated avoid wearing mask think currently wearing masks?

many them. one thing everyone else wearing them. another completely given go ahead remove them. People begrudgingly wore now, vaccinated not. expert, stayed holiday inn. lie.  unclear. meant get 70% young people vaccinated, start hesitancy. think 90% total population definitely realistic. care people, fact every time someone gets infected, virus gets chance mutate, that, new chance break vaccines.   Even Americans seem grasp Federal government limited power. schools Oregon closed longer Biden administration wanted schools Florida open wanted. I'm fully vaccinated; I've since tail end April. I'm allowed roam free now. I'm threat you. 

Allow vaccinated enjoy fruits vaccination. Thank god. think equally (if urgent concern) length time vaccine provides protection.I assume scientist using data folks initial volunteer initial groups. I'm hoping provides year more, considering everything USA going back normal, need prepared injections boosters.  50% population gotten first doses

That factually inaccurate. 47% received single dose, rate vaccination dropped weeks. Stop denying science. Vaccines work important note imperfect sample getting. likely happening one group comments one way thee stays relatively silent. flip flops new changes.

Creates ""wow sub changes mind"" bias. fights awesome, Yes, doesn‚Äôt change fact healthy people dying high risk people surviving well, video shows someone high risk factors still got sick. statistics misquoted wrongfully explained. say person degree mathematical sciences teaches statistics Israel also locked pretty hard vaccination campaign huge percentage population fully vaccinated. combination key speed numbers dropped. kinda opposite. don‚Äôt disagree, wonder easing mask recommendations influence inflation employment statistics. Two years find bad people affected virus long term.

There likely government programs help people long term problems infection.  We're 65% population currently 35s vaccinated kids vaccinated... think 90% realistic definitely think unvaccinated kids keep masking indoors every school aged child chance get vaccine.

There chance never receive emergency authorization though. Covid emergency group medicine for. FDA CDC committee members seriously question emergency 12-15.

If case numbers way lower September, could even questions marks 5-11 even lower risk. Anyone got vaccinated point continue wear mask. Anyone chooses go without probably denier.

I unhappy turn events I'm talking domestic flights international flights. latter obviously depends coordination two countries. disappointing. 

I considered ""on left"" whole life, trump. pro-trump appalled behavior ""the left"".

Woke sure enlightened. They've gone plaid. science evolved

The science change. message did. I'm even ""expert"" promise lie. shocked! masks aren‚Äôt major burden, pandemic over. Telling people stop masking indoors public harmful, benefits absolutely one.

I thought CDC recommendation pretty bad idea, actually think possibly even quite clever.

Let's imagine two extremes:

* Unvaccinated people continue wear masks, vaccinated people don't.
  * End result: negligible increase R\_effective, improvement mental health happiness among vaccinated.
* unvaccinated people use opportunity cheat system.
  * End result: coronavirus cycles quickly population, point granting large fraction people level immunity. Again, miniscule additional impact/risk vaccinated people, massive mental health benefit them.

Under scenarios, unvaccinated population bears almost cost (of wearing mask first scenario, increased risk COVID latter).

For record:

* personally plan continue masking buildings, despite fully vaccinated.
* I'd prefer Israeli-style system vaccine IDs. recognize unrealistic country. community spread virus dropped significantly, real world risk catching virus gone down. take around 50+ years part.  long we're bacon, everyone loves eat bacon. one allowed disagree CDC president now? 

I've read comments give shit, want wear mask. pretend anything that. I'm sorry suffer 12 months thin cloth mouth asking two weeks literally much ask got one else matters. Big agree me. shots good mask. got shot, I'm done playing corona game. Let businesses draconian rules, weeks making money move forward rest society.  people lie carry pitbull/chihuahua/lizard store w/ ""Service Dog"" vest.  course they'll lie. point I've decided I'm able what's right others whole family either fully vaccinated couple weeks. say everybody opportunity get vaccinated lift mandates (or leave honor) see happens. numbers get control change way things. count number people I've seen maskless store last year one hand. Probably live good state. Wtf. spent 14 months life utter lockdown they're going try villify simply following recommendations trusted scientists? Really unfair. Like said, deny science want to, cannot spread covid vaccinated really. many places still week appointment list. Er... yes did: Huh, know that, silly way it. like Barnett based population either. actually know new policy cause surge not, know plenty Americans believe virus, forced wear mask public - change, lie vaccinated avoid masking, spread virus. also know herd immunity around 70-80% population - less 50%, means potential surge. Americans, including children got chance get vaccinated yet, double safety measures think twice visiting indoor markets/shops. CDC waited month recently approved age groups get shots, opened them.

Also, reason chose India let guard down, need learn mistakes. think surge bad India, 175 Million unvaccinated Americans means still room spread, I'd hate return restrictions it. send another stimulus check people prove vaccinated/get vaccine. bet people would get vaccinated way. know, thinking today. seem way lot places I‚Äôve heard. Strangely, lot ‚Äúbig talkers‚Äù around masks vaccines. 

But comes it, vast majority still masking indoors they‚Äôre talk don‚Äôt really want confrontation. past days since announcement, humongous increase amount people unmasked stores. vaccination rate still super low. Everyone lies. It‚Äôs issue humanity.........  Gotta honest

Those willing probably don‚Äôt even care point  care regardless? vaccinated person family. pissed? Sure. Still love them. going visit southeast anytime soon? Hell no. Still care tho. leave kamis place whenever want.  Oh I‚Äôm trying downplay anything relating child‚Äôs health. data far seems worried child catching flu rather worried covid. Obviously would better catch either. Yep totally agree big political move think cdc reverse course quickly. Biden administration bad week. War middle east, bad policies effecting inflation Job numbers. needed good PR. get wrong fully support masks vaccinated. Fuck 'em  CDC engaging pregnant woman gotten vaccine, developing database following time. you‚Äôre still midst vaccination timeline, wear mask fully protected? none...why risk circumstances, miraculously effective safe vaccine global pandemic caused horrifying physical, mental, financial suffering? concern Indian variant vaccine efficacy, transmissibility strain. could 50% transmissible UK variant, would mean would cause mass hospitalisations unvaccinated, still large number hospitalisations vaccinated, given vaccines imperfect. huge surge cases always cause mass hospitalisations, irrespective many people vaccinated. Yes. also holding vaccinated teenagers teachers hostage. reason exceptions, hopefully also lifted months. helping Mother Nature carry job natural selection. Well always case. clear manipulation designed entice people get vaccinated. Pretty shitty way create policy ask me. Private businesses retain right ask customers mask.  I'm fully vaccinated 

Question 

Can anybody say what's going vaccinated people still getting Covid-19? Could agree more. Agreed! messaging terrible. you‚Äôre right people hear headline act consider best interest.

That‚Äôs said top CDC demonstrates poor understanding psychology. benefit say ‚Äúfully vaccinated people don‚Äôt need masks*‚Äù ? creates confusion undermine perceived legitimacy. previous mask recommendation didn‚Äôt harm anyone real epidemiological benefit. no, *DOES* make expert know silly, clearly smarter everyone known without expert opinion Yeah don‚Äôt care enough read that, seem insufferable obviously care way me, bye Lol. 5 hear old screaming mom now. Wow Theyre stupid. know certain amount lie. They've used forecasts. environment vaccines increasingly taking deaths hospitalizations making rare, covid entirely different disease. much lower case fatality disability rate. Much death disability rate something almost people opt wearing masks taking vaccines. american, expert. They'll lie wonder many people going lie direction (or disclose all): get vaccine &amp; keep quiet best solely avoid coming back office. I'm still WFH crowd wants stay WFH forever &amp; would even willing take small pay-cut it.  Wales also set national reserve list young people could get spare doses. understand rest UK done same, every dose counts. stupid (sometimes good) thing America cant legally ask customer proof anything. ""honor questions"" ask pretty sure can't ask customer ""paper work.""

&amp;#x200B;

Example: work hotel accept pets, Ada ones (works honor system) ask specific questions. Like, ""Is service animal"" ""what services provides"" Also learning years education? Medicine nursing theory? 

(Hint: lots latter) need experts tell they'll lie  downvoted you. I'm lying. Around 50% 18+ area least one dose. cases plummeted, we've days long spurts without death. feel decently safe vaccine. Mine across street too. really shop either unless to. Sure, target less crowded usually cleaner, also fewer options never find shit. shopping early morning, customers really issue. 

But I'm really speaking target people look others. Nobody better human shopping target Walmart. Teachers staff protected. Parents grandparents home protected. Elementary Kids can‚Äôt get vaccinated yet far far less risk suffering Covid. fact, flu greater threat. Make masks optional kids. Interesting. protecting others mostly good? hope gets vaccinated eventually, barring hope run afoul another non-vaccinator concerned breathe goes. think said enough generate headline like damage done. carry certain way wants maintain 'apolitical ' credentials. Critical thinking exercise:

&amp;#x200B;

What infection rate, hospitilization rate, death rate vaccinated people?    needed expert tell common folk already knew? Still care. kid. take reasonable precautions shall Experts? think anyone seen fuk wits could tell anti vax people! need experts say this....we already know people country behave üòí problem isn‚Äôt Olympics per se, although local commentators decried vast sums spent efforts‚Äîthe equivalent $15.4 billion, double amount Tokyo‚Äôs organizers claimed would needed bid, 2013. Rather, Olympics become symbol Japanese government‚Äôs inept response coronavirus pandemic.

‚Ä¶ high ground well, vaccine available employees since Feb 17, didnt get shot thats problem.

You understand literally ""barely getting by"" numbers company large them. normally profit 9-10 billion profit margin 1% first quarter year. Disney verge bankruptcy numbers, choice.  Unless you‚Äôre directly interacting person, cares? total stranger store walking street masked, difference you?  perfect push vaccinations. anti vax/anti-mask pondering do, vax live consequences. Yes, friends make fun end hospital complaining one warned you.  correctly identifying limitation. much people can't vaccinated (though small fraction population fall category people less likely sufficiently robust response vaccine. tested antibody titre cell response? might reasonable proxy least give peace mind.

My sympathies plight. can't easy. especially can't easy number people claim immunocompromised (be self-diagnosed whatever crystal peddling quack without real credentials sold line) skyrocketed last years. course lie come on.... Yes course they'll lie. people tired masks [archive link anyone trouble accessing article great thing mRNA tech quick easily changed. going mutations need new shots yearly foreseeable future.

Infact covid-19 never fully going eradicated small pox been. 

I'll get new shot everytime comes  ‚ÄúConvenient‚Äù ‚Äúextremely inconvenient‚Äù miles apart. can‚Äôt imagine scenario temporarily covering nose mouth thin piece paper ‚Äúextremely inconvenient‚Äù especially 14 months. Masks cheap ans ubiquitous. places give one forgot bring one.

Wearing N95 12 hours straight? that‚Äôs inconvenient.

I don‚Äôt think convenience (or lack thereof) driving mask resistance. people talk like civil liberties violated. fucking shit  ~33% remaining 40% vaccinated = ~12-15% people really care much. 

But soon tell something .... they'll lie cheat steal become hostile show can't tell do. to. They‚Äôll need keep wearing masks, we. I‚Äôve got 3 year old, we‚Äôll keep wearing masks gets vaccination. hope people lacked motivation get moved they‚Äôre worried mask mandate gone- like happened friend. Dr House already said it: people always lie blunt, avoid 'wading in' discussion article read. Ya lot articles get downvoted lol  I'm expert mom says gonna lie. gonna make vaccine card Red Rocket, standing lie likely die... I'm OK this. Paaaaaaaaywaaaaaassaaalllllllllllllllllllllll sure related, live Cheyenne, Wyoming, State voted 69.9% Trump. Today, May 16th, coming week President Biden CDC told us good news, went one local Walmart‚Äôs afternoon would say approximately 80% people store wearing mask. first time since announcement wasn‚Äôt sure would see store. fully expecting see handful people wearing mask. cares endangering antivaxxers. Blessings you. kids... Wow. past year something nobody ever forget, undoubtedly mental emotional health repercussions profound subtle. death, distancing, division, confusion. need hugs. 

Well, do, too.   Hello, two facts broadly agreed upon many months need sourcing. comments responded source claims either.

Around 22 years old covid becomes deadly flu. older kids flu deadly young children flu much deadly. 

N95 face shield combo like 99% protective exposure point CDC guidelines even consider exposure needing quarantine wearing them.

Both commonly agreed upon facts despite downvotes disagree? It‚Äôs pretty ironic vocal mask wearers people people probably don‚Äôt want around anyways humor become cancel. crap gets posted feed without permission can‚Äôt say anything. Gtfo mean half articles posted arent new important data. Weird reason downvote. answer completely evasive don‚Äôt necessarily disagree CDC waited bit longer least given advanced notice businesses states could figure logistics (like checking vaccine cards getting unvaccinated workers N95‚Äôs), see point there. 

The question though looking aggregate much impact hypothetical liars going make. extremely high amounts vulnerable population vaccinated, localized outbreaks cases going result overwhelmed hospitals cause mass increases deaths, main point restrictions. India also different US 3x population, lots extreme poverty, low functioning healthcare system, even guard let down, it‚Äôs going outcome. 

I totally understand you‚Äôre coming agree CDC could done much better job communicating changes, point need realize covid us vaccines make it‚Äôs threat level seasonal flu, makes additional mitigation necessary. don‚Äôt think will. think anyone didn‚Äôt get vaccine tell straight face didn‚Äôt wearing mask. words, toddler logic going die? Maybe 2% will. flu-like symptoms recover. LOL sad üòÇ interact risk getting covid fully vaccinating

No can't. vaccine 100% effective, even make sick still spread it.

Wear mask. Fuck mask  well fitting N95 mask proven make safer, heck talking about? Even it‚Äôs small amount there‚Äôs still scientific proof helps nation rational people, mobile home park full idiots. Let's this. want ""countrymen"", stupid see sink own, let's get started.   staggering amount cognitive dissonance post hoc rationalizations among site's average user. CDC capitulating masking evidence support it. NPIs made difference. god anti science people piss   Fair point mean half million deaths, that‚Äôs pretty fair #3 overall cause death. sure there‚Äôs questionable information sides it‚Äôs difference one side scientists best information have, constantly updating reforming opinions data comes in, anti vax covid deniers, refuse wear masks they‚Äôre cherry picking context statistics using unverified YouTube videos sources know Reddit thrilled inconvenienced masks anymore, Dana Bash raises excellent point. families kids younger 12? CDC guidelines, stores lifting mask requirements, enables COVID deniers. read article?

Honestly no. speaking nation, speaking graduating class.

Hm. Okay. 220k 12 15 year olds today  Yeah 20 month old daughter worried taking anywhere Hell, made bacon day, guinea pigs even sniffing air looking bite. I‚Äôm genuinely confused anyone cares, you‚Äôre concerned get vaccine, they‚Äôre widely available. you‚Äôre not, risks covid covered plenty get live consequences actions hate say it, people also ones getting vaccinated lowest rates too. ways, need take responsibility get damn vaccine already. One thing never quite understood bothered look exactly issuing mask exemptions conditions would even qualify exemption? Asthma? respiratory conditions? Like holy shit immune system already compromised, case likely wear mask. makes zero sense medical professional would telling someone compromised immune system get exemption. fuck. according studies. point though. I'm already low risk category hospitalization. I'm worried transmitting others unknowingly. 

It's ok discussions topic without people wanting snap back ""iF yOuRe vAcCiNaTeD cArE!?!?""

Because care people around me. ill intended. Yelp give business owners option remove reviews left anti-maskers.  Water wet. Sky blue. I‚Äôve going around around brain. No, kid isn‚Äôt likely get seriously ill COVID. damn, much mildest symptoms, he‚Äôll school and/or summer childcare gets negative test. two weeks, gets positive test. R.I.P. job. read article?

It commencement speech, remarks entirely appropriate within context. speaking nation, speaking graduating class. already lying **before** change. know people **not** vaccinated ones likely ignore mask guidance, likely answer vaccine questions truthfully, refuse answer asked (often making huge confrontations it). cannot base system trusting answer question made political litmus test repeatedly proven unreliable. saw news, immediately knew terrible idea. now, hell rung it‚Äôs going hard try stop idiots got free pass since vaccine passports aren‚Äôt going implemented US. ‚ÄúIf would rather die,‚Äù said Scrooge, ‚Äúthey better it, decrease surplus population.‚Äù  - think that‚Äôs rationale behind centralized national registry ESAs Support Animals. think becomes problem people bad faith - many people medical need one, buy credentials online, take animal plane public bite / defecate / bark / otherwise disturb peace, making people wary legitimate service animals. can't think time anxiety could possibly justified now.

Edit: grammar Seeing lot people identifying ‚Äúvaccinated‚Äù .. Oh well.. Population control volunteers. much immunity need go back normal life? percentage looking here?

There countless studies showing anywhere 85-99+% chance getting serious case COVID, needing hospitalized, dying *one* dose vaccines plus weeks time. actually position *had* 2nd dose literally days ""maximum coverage."" 

You're going fine. though others wearing mask important wearing mask, continuing wear mask immunity absolute maximum level give little bit added protection along maybe peace mind, seems much important factor case. 

Because current level protection right now, whether *or* anyone else wearing mask almost irrelevant you. would *remarkably* rare virus problem you.   Considering record CDC know I'm worried

CDC, group people that

* Told us nothing worry pandemic hit Asian countries hard.

* Recommend wearing masks, went far saying harmful (walked back said want healthcare workers enough PPE), best white lie.

* Told us confidently covid airborne (of course is).

* rep Rachel TV asked affects children people goin unmasked, answer feel really bad people actually can‚Äôt take vaccine, boyfriend take immune suppressants worry damn racist pandemic‚Ä¶ fast food can't make someone else sick

Some kids would like word right thing instance puts others risk. That's total false equivalence.

Everybody vaccine. responsibility care people never come around get vaccinated. time, everybody gets chance get it, everybody left alone masks dropped. usual. Suppose get car accident hospital try rush full COVID patients refused vaccine. yes hurt you. Hell yeah we‚Äôre gonna lie! Keep wearing mask makes feel noble. believe science though They're guessing they're tracking that. reportable. fuckin duh  Wiz‚Äôs? came comments read one. üôÇ It‚Äôs going another couple months. COVID going away it‚Äôs endemic population. You‚Äôll decide comfortable removing mask point else you‚Äôll wearing one forever. week. Well mean revel denier's illness death. I'm going rub salt wound grieving family, either. compassion. family member moved loved one nearly actually dying covid, nothing say amounting ""we told so"" sway them. conversation would better left emotions tempered, must it. Remind ! 1 month Water wet Prisons vaccinated mandatory...I know know can't force medical treatment anyone dream Duh. actual data effective vaccine population mask ?
So far studies data done population wearing masks right ?  would allow go back normal? People would feel comfortable going they'd turning away like 20% potential customers additional traffic brought vaxxed hesitant people would outweigh anti-vaxxers. (Plus can't imagine anti-vaxxers type kind customers lot higher end places want attract anyway) would seem article OP put National Nurses United antivaxxers read article Colorado, earliest could vaccinated general population April 3, earliest could get second dose fully immunized week. it‚Äôs impossible literally every person *who wants vaccinated* immunized now. 

So going anti vax, anti mask assholes shedding polyester-filtered face skin infecting people staying masked achieve full immunity. 

Nevermind can‚Äôt get vaccine‚Äîkids compromised Immune systems. 

We‚Äôll wearing masks till 5 year old vaccine, even though we‚Äôve gotten shots Don‚Äôt take word it, look rates hospitalizations deaths young children yourself. risk incredibly small. age bracket, it‚Äôs actually comparable bad flu strain. I‚Äôm well aware bud. grandma also caught died Covid anti mask twat worked assisted living facility. they'll possible create vector variants passed us unvaccinated children. Fuck em course will. Non-expert here... Well duh. Yes, 40% fully vaccinated. people allowed vaccinated? CDC basically said age group get vaccine mask, also recently said going school wear mask since vaccine available young people. make sense you? want kids protecting masks believe people 12 older protect other? know full well unvaccinated people wear mask. kids mercy people older them? Also, people younger 16 much opportunity fully vaccinated. 

Also, tell people take precautions unable vaccinate seems pretty selfish me. realize lot immunocompromised people work living? thing protecting work others wearing masks. school kids? CDC thinks low risk still guidelines wear masks? Even low risk plenty kids vulnerable pre-existing conditions. 

You need realize American CDC one organization. made plenty mistakes throughout pandemic. Also, doctor, work healthcare. trust plenty scientists criticized rulings. Even largest nursing union has. studies mentioned available online well. could research easy. making could look up. CDC also acknowledges reinfections rare guidelines apply them? poor public health measure. Eating fast food can't make someone else sick. COVID can. Choosing right thing instance puts others risk. That's total false equivalence. haven‚Äôt looked Moderna Johnson Johnson‚Äôs numbers look like. defined CDC Pfizer 100% effectiveness preventing severe disease, likely meaning outliers, (maybe 96 year old died heart couldnt take strain minor illness, dunno something like that). 99.9999% gets rounded 100. go indoors mask easy tell someone without mask lying fully vaccinated. ask president is. likelihood toddler getting COVID low. It‚Äôs even less likely they‚Äôll display symptoms become severely ill virus. understand mask mandate switch scary, what‚Äôs alternative here? agree, couched full repeat Winter 2020: Full lockdowns, distancing, thousands deaths day, another cancelled holiday season.

Can‚Äôt see happening Western country. Agreed. compassion idiots went maskless parties. feel people killed. propose do? can‚Äôt force someone get vaccine. Taiwan, health insurance card chip it. Go doctor, put card like credit card, doctor access medical history right there. standard years. Takes like 2 minutes check hospital clinic even new patient.

Privacy laws stringent US. suppose someone stole purse doctors office could access information.  would digital trail office accessed time though. Yes, people lie lot things. may lie immigration status, whether they're 18 older. hardly justifies requiring people constantly able prove ""legality"".  I'm american say jab No. right decide want sick not. dont right cigarettes, alcohol fast food banned too. things unecessary deadly. long legal, make decisions. ‚ÄúExperts say they‚Äôll lie‚Äù. Nice warn us advance they‚Äôll lie, already knew that. quote doesn‚Äôt even support you‚Äôre saying?? He‚Äôs saying they‚Äôll clarify situations necessary coming weeks. people disagreeing CDC right now. 

Good one üòò New mask rules trust Americans get sick vaccine, attempt push herd immunity.

C‚Äôest la vie. Correct, meant vaccinated, unvaccinated. Thanks. haven‚Äôt heard legitimate medical reason someone can‚Äôt get vaccine yet. Except can't take kids anywhere Ya cares. one cares get vaccinated? Problem solved One week second dose, decided go drink buddies. Feels good go without worry. there‚Äôs gonna lot people say ‚Äúwell vaccines work, vaccinated people still wearing masks?

Earlier today epidemiologist Cali made plea Newsom long refused loosen state's mask mandate accordance CDC guidelines risk giving impression trust vaccines studies shown covid may grant immunity years even decades. people either covid, vaccinated probably panic. look numbers see happened.. don‚Äôt think CDC well? It‚Äôs 12 (phizer). agree masks forever. fully support idea need mask vaccinated. Unvaccinated people still wear especially variants  personally choice. It‚Äôs also personal choice call jackass making stupid fucking choice. fantastic article history definition ‚Äúairborne‚Äù Wired recently. you‚Äôre vaccinated child wearing sufficient mask, don‚Äôt worry people pretending vaccinated 0.03% metro area's population, good turn out! ...no shit can‚Äôt tell parody post  don‚Äôt know things everywhere.

But literally one cares. people anti mask aren‚Äôt going magically wear masks CDC said so.

So people still wearing begin people follow guidelines, probably got vaccinated now. generally aren‚Äôt awful people. kinda thing makes lose faith humanity in: wettest puddles ones water it. one gets it. know masks effective stopping spreading germs others stopping other's germs spreading you? Average count like late June 2020 levels dropping fast. Honestly think reach 20k 7-day average end May would put us May 2020 levels far testing. Socialized healthcare subsidizes fat people problems extreme sports injuries Yeah, 10 year-old well.

Also, another note...I‚Äôm
Immunocompromised ineligible so...

Not everyone doesn‚Äôt vaccine falls neat category idiot. scenarios. say happen. says viral pics saw mislabeled show happening month US. One thing covid shown fking crazy humans be, many different ways lol.

It's like, wear mask, wash hands got vaccine offered me.

It's like, really hard? barely made effort everything CDC asked. Australia able lock door shut outside influences contact tracing locking breakouts within country. benefited sharing borders international flights come in. Heck even Australian citizens issues getting back home. lucky reacted quickly case numbers low. US doesnt option would‚Äôve make decision January 2020

ETA: also Australia remain locked outsiders get vaccine fully rolled later year. think allowing NZ travelers NZ could AUS did. different path AUS NZ point Honestly putting bullshit imaginable year (business owner) everything within power correctly, I‚Äôm Darwin mindset now- let strongest smartest survive. I‚Äôm exhausted this- staff fully vaccinated. keep arguing idiots safety, proceed knowing safe. really want keep others safe, draw line sand point insanity idiots roaming around society? give caring everyone around safe? 

This genuine question I‚Äôm looking perspective view understanding I‚Äôm seeing point pandemic. reason they‚Äôre changing tune try appeal people think, ‚Äúoh, go get vaccine, don‚Äôt deal many restrictions.‚Äù It‚Äôs encourage widespread acceptance vaccine. That‚Äôs goal. It‚Äôs trying send message ‚Äúmasks needed anymore,‚Äù though many take way. much people, they‚Äôve put us dire peril throughout entire pandemic. close enough 100% say everyone. everyone, including freaking CDC, actually thrilled. dont need change daily behavior due .008% chance get sniffles 2 days, that's choose you, everyone around choosing move life safe so. Long term complications still pretty unknown, right? Yes, week walk-in clinics opened. PA royally screwed pooch. Philly one last areas USA vaccine access. Still need another week people well protected. seems week two premature area. county state don‚Äôt mind asking?

3. one week away, nothing changed moving ahead, concerns let us know work doctor

4. Date arrived, policy enacted. Good...we need less republican votes anyway... Yes, *even with* flu shot kids die flu covid - that's point. Wow, guess I'm expert. bring proof birthdate 14 yr old.

What? shitty want horrible people whose actions hurt others face repercussions? think it‚Äôs unacceptable busy fighting fairness accommodation fail hold people accountable actions. can‚Äôt even begin tally damage caused covidiots... understandable many us want suffer easily forget forgive them. shown complete disregard communities... foolish see anything traitors. Salt wounds way ""people"" learn. continue get infected. reach herd immunity either way.  ever spent 8 hours blow drying hair mask gotten little bits haircut clippings mask spent 4 hours balayage highlight dry mouth couldn‚Äôt take sip water wear mask? assuming following protocols like masks, distancing etc?

They got indoor dining. anyone know long vaccinated afult could carrying virus, risking infecting unvaccinated child home? pretend like children matter? death contagious cause matter death? dead either way. Reading comments, assumed state great vaccine enthusiasm turns assumption right. easy guess states able open eligibility everyone earliest able enthusiasm. 

I point *huge* benefit eligibility opening later seem fully appreciate. peers vaccinated. way more. 64% Vermonters protection virus (compared 45% nation whole) thus less likely able spread it. got vaccine later peers vaccinated state US. bad thing personal level protection. very, good thing. regions, people get sick, small portion die, reminder level natural immunity. Others may see around get sick die decide vaccine actually worth it. end day though vaccinations natural infection, disease enough hosts serious threat society. can‚Äôt get fully vaccinated quickly. It‚Äôs possible. I‚Äôm getting 2nd dose Tuesday waiting 3 weeks doses wait 2 weeks take effect. Meanwhile people going go around lying vaccination status turning businesses spreader events.   You‚Äôre missing point entirely.  never said girlfriend flu-like symptoms (fever, headache, congestion) 12 days 2nd Pfizer shot. Previously, mild tiredness headaches day 2nd shot, fine afterwards. 

What could be? It‚Äôs really sad little empathy others. Duh. Got second Moderna shot today. don‚Äôt really feel side effects. corona November shots, I‚Äôm full antibodies, still wear mask. lot us employers force us keep wearing masks long customers want keep wearing them, even though it‚Äôs easy us show vaccine proof plus everyone work vaccinated even announced anyway. kid risk.. thanks cdc fucking scum bags Also, relied webmd health data probable diagnosis‚Äô id every virus, disease, disorder known man. guess misread original comment. case, effective/reliable/efficient different things, measured different reasonable metrics. effective/efficient, maybe vaccines win. reliable.

Yes, vaccines basically miracle - doubt that. needed laugh CDC insanity. 14 days second dose day CDC lost minds‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm happy camper. Thanks making laugh even though you‚Äôre also totally right. I'm pro-vax, I'm literally trying understand better okay start taking masks off. people afraid already antibodies and/or vaccine children don‚Äôt access vaccine Ahh ok thanks! Lol CDC swallow pride. always ""we're sure spread vaccinated. let's play safe"" ""Yup, found can't spread it, drop mask vaccinated"" news, water wet Good bot hope Sputnik deemed safe effective get approved EMA. It'd nice see cross-bloc acceptance other's vaccines. moment West using Western vaccines, China using Chinese vaccines, Russia using Russian vaccines, developing world princess they're trying woo. hence term x age..... vaccine side effects? Next 10 years gunna wild!  really need ""expert"" tell us this? ever, reason, decide pro create please wear mask. boom 87% since peak January Nooooooooooo! method measurement terrible. 

The CDC accurate numbers many doses actually administered daily basis. delayed 5 days perfectly accurate measure data dumps actual doses given specific day. know people insist measuring data dumps far accurate data available directly CDC. stupid. True, hard limit one year old contact with. keep thinking bucko. Whatever floats boat.  Also anybody caught making/selling cards. easy get fake vaccine card, must easy find guys making them. Thank you! I've waiting acknowledge intersectionality pandemic. can't show are. Oh really. thought people immune . Silly  Yeah, true. friends already said going lie everyone‚Äôs face say vaccinated. sad Oh no!! consequences inaction! /r/covid19 want science. sub hot takes making fun right.  Florida substantial number cases shortly NU did, fucking NYers flooded go escape lockdowns. Advancement treatment happened across country rate. last six months NY still done worse FL. can‚Äôt believe anti-vax propaganda like still home sub. 95% effective means. See sibling comments correct explanation. long. think soon full authorization happens, many changes people's health insurance. want show got shot? Ok...but pay higher rates. 

I think employers also drop covid safety nets (time without penalty, paid time quarantine, etc) immediately well. 

People need think ahead things surprised w CDC mask changes vaxed individuals. day changes 6 weeks late prepping moment. Well us work public means dealing lying assholes day claim fully vaccinated wear mask, know damn well aren‚Äôt. work public also live small children immune compromised ‚Äúmoving fuck on‚Äù little difficult. There‚Äôs always another POV, isn‚Äôt there? Especially every state mandates different outdoor vs indoor. example weddings outdoors allowed attendees vs indoors should‚Äôve signaled knew transmission less. today saw someone different sub worry touch transmission! CDC losing cred week. It‚Äôs really interesting many stories like this. definitely lot guilt getting vaccines early feeling like someone else deserved more. 

I eligible offered condition have. looked could scheduled almost anywhere, kept looking ‚ÄúI‚Äôm relatively healthy!‚Äù found one place said Chronic went ‚Äúwell that‚Äôs that! I‚Äôve got wait.‚Äù afraid I‚Äôd taking someone else‚Äôs dose. (Fully vaxxed now) That‚Äôs assuming long term variants different effects children Covid. Truth don‚Äôt know. Parents care this. 
Also totally true UK variant dominated places US now. though? Toddlers little germ factories

I agree chances getting symptomatic tiny. However, won‚Äôt know log term effects 5, 10, 20 years maybe. 

I‚Äôm saying things don‚Äôt need start moving on, although infant 2 year old I‚Äôd kinda prefer it. completely dismissing 12 crowd (soon 2 under?) ‚Äúahh, they‚Äôll fiiiiine‚Äù radically premature  vaccinated highly unlikely spread. kid wear mask keep socially distant others. Please explain ironic. going ignore lot people you‚Äôre afraid antibodies either vaccine getting virus already. people live fear got amigo Pfizer study 6 months 11 years won‚Äôt ready FDA approval early 2022. mention immunocompromised people, us vaccine save serious complications death.

Don't get wrong, I'm saying cost borne ""bad unvaccinated"" (anti vaxxers).

My point seemed like nutty policy first announced makes sense. Many have. May always, may everyone - many. Probably drive office (many can) use public transport - quite bit safer. I've started encountering ""morning traffic"" spot highway since march last year. neighbor started driving work days since January. friend mine though says trains subways still quite empty rush hour. Unless it‚Äôs kids teach. higher risk almost group. We‚Äôve already gone semi lockdown, F&amp;B, 100% work home, closed schools. Tighter measures may follow depending situation evolves. LOL know Katalin Kariko said husband November 8 first results came in? ""Oh, works""

May God bless geniuses gave us vaccines. variant emerges almost certainly US cases almost certainly get anyway. still mask 2024 poor countries Africa finished fully vaccinating Wests hoarding? think wonder changes children wear masks, includes 12-16 year olds get vaccinated Yes, people drive cars risky things daily much higher risk death injury without fear worry. Calm down. people vaccinated don‚Äôt need wear masks people weren‚Äôt wearing masks anyway refuse get vaccinated. 

Essentially wearing masks nothing going forward people need wear refuse wear get vaccinated. fuck ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Water wet. Kid doesn‚Äôt. Kid fine. Schools aren‚Äôt zones transmissions. Kid fine even kid gets it.  WTF ""the science"" case? That‚Äôs said. Unvaccinated wear masks. ‚ÄúHowever, U.K. medical researchers concluded February clinical impact strain children ‚Äúyet fully defined.‚Äù found second wave infections country, dominated B.1.1.7 variant, send children young people hospital, said likely higher prevalence Covid-19 time responsible uptick. also found evidence severe disease occurred children young people second wave, thus suggesting variant result severe infection among children original Covid-19 strain. ‚Äú

This bottom article which, bizarrely enough, written finance guy. Kids aren‚Äôt dying droves. That‚Äôs fact. shut everything vaccine move forward? understand concern there‚Äôs data concerned about, think people fairly fed stressing without data back stress. ‚Äúwe standing edge precipice‚Äù talk isn‚Äôt ‚Äúexercise caution‚Äù talk, uneducated ass feels shifting toward. also bashful gene. I‚Äôve followed enough know ‚Äúcomorbidities‚Äù serious enough put much greater risk, I‚Äôm exposed much risk, anyway. work home, potential exposure shopping places guidelines closely followed, everyone wearing masks seen high ceilings Target? know Sundays always low NYT showing 16k cases today. Crazy!!! faith Americans.   I'd surprised stat true. Maybe talking young/new nurses? 91.6% effective, around effectiveness mRNA Vaccine efficacy, based numbers confirmed COVID-19 cases 21 days first dose vaccine, reported 91¬∑6% (95% CI Yeah that's thing. idiots care kids. care denying human rights.  California nice way.

Vaccination opened adults April 15. means people got second doses four weeks later (or three Pfizer, think). Count two weeks get maximum immunity measured far, give two weeks wiggle room people get appointment right away.

Mask mandate ends June 15.

After point, there's excuse fully vaccinated.

Before point, nice unmasked people breathing grocery store.

Kids avoided anyway they're gross petri dishes disease even we're fighting pandemic. said masks weren‚Äôt necessary, a) shortage ppe best save front lines b) one knew serious droplet spreading was. 
It‚Äôs moving goal posts, data comes make better hypothesis plans, it‚Äôs science works Sounds like they‚Äôre probably gonna get covid point. us got vaccinated can‚Äôt really anything help either way, honest. It‚Äôs lucky kids much less affected adults.  Exactly. mRNA delicate kept super cold. ambient heat deactivate it. job short amount time, produces spike proteins, dissolved. That's also need second dose. gone like week max. Nope think people like shockingly stupid, worth time, understand never will. trying troll cause honestly hard believe people like actually exist, serious feel bad you, either parents education system failed you. love compare statistics un mitigated flu season disease completely rearranged society fight act like oh it‚Äôs hundred more, ya many there‚Äôs mitigation‚Äôs like masks distancing And/or higher premiums non-vaccinated, like smokers. news fully vaccinated people able go maskless definitely going help push people get vaccines. took announcement 3 roommates finally budge get shot. words ‚Äúwe thought we‚Äôd time holding out.‚Äù news NOAA says water wet. Yeah, real result total erosion mask discipline regardless vaccination status. Timed perfectly doomsday spike India likely anything generate vaccine-resistant strain (note: undertstand random chance may happen).  I've read publication, honestly, place. big bold print, says:
 
""12.9% Percentage UK children aged 2 11 still covid-19 symptoms five weeks initial infection""
 
So it? half symptoms 120 days, 12.9% symptoms five weeks?
 
I'm swayed one, even though comes normally trusted source. website trial says something entirely different. Go ‚ÄúWhen expect results study? able receive AVERAGE age Haiti TWENTY THREE according article. That's clearly biggest cause low mortality, changing. open buildings well effective preventing spread. feel like another thing favour lack international travel. Probably ton people comparatively coming Haiti compared say India.

I know going change, seem common story third world countries appear hit less hard covid first second world countries. works too. good something prove vaccinated think we'll wind situation states form herd immunity states close all; least evidence shifts people's opinions.  


I think new england reach 80% vaccinated example. yes 20% population point vaccinated risk travelers states honestly one time much population state state visitors? imagine it'd high enough make huge impact overall, population scale (but course unfortunate individual family) 


It'll issue small spikes think states ever see large daily numbers again. 


maybe see case numbers fall high vaccination states (84% currently new Hampshire highest rate there's data error there, 65% Vermont #2) low vaccination states (Mississippi 32.5% currently thus least vaccinated state); maybe people feel encouraged get vaccinated rather risk covid. Great post. feel like clearly outlines reasonable stance people got vaccine yet. People got vaccine people too. like immunocompromised groups people trying defend shutting everything instead remaining open 'accepting losses.'  cred? Scroll :) Monkey see monkey do.

People see wear masks, feel social pressure wear one too.

Tadaah. You‚Äôre protected wearing mask.

(Yes yes, I‚Äôm aware there‚Äôs still lot people don‚Äôt feel social pressure) Yeah, shit ""One death tragedy. million deaths statistics."" -Joseph Stalin. see lot you.

I'm going debate you, disgust me. proven liar.  Post-1918 pandemic pandemic mental illness. sanitariums built period. Likely connected flu.

Oh, easier tell *not* right time (like now) predict *will* right time. I'm saying answers, I've guessing June would turning point. Based results Israel time takes full protection kick vaccines. became widely available 16+ last three four weeks, take six weeks first dose full opinion better CDC?

It necessarily, suspect CDC is... altering message bit based think change behavior. That's something worry about, random internet commenter. KiDs DoNt GeT BaD CaSeS‚Ä¶.ya 5 years there‚Äôs whole bunch toddlers grow start showing decreased lung function, cardiovascular issues, decreased brain function. see problem adults point. adults anti mask, anti vaccine Republicans dragging shit twice long needed be. Fuck em. Haha, oh, want play absolute numbers game? Okay, let's play.

340 kids die fire burns.

599 heart disease (in country [where 20% kids last time heard anyone GAF that?

995 die drowning.

4074 die car crashes (so sure better take little Johnny doctor vehicle get sick!)

3,143 firearms.

1,430 suffocating (that's right, anything smaller baseball house statistically likely kill kid covid.

Look, death tragic, yes, wanna play numbers game, let's play.

Source numbers above: safety information CDC **not** policy advice. Given many people still vaccinated, vaccination passports, **medical** information mean new **policy** vaccinated people go maskless indoors stores, concerts, whatever.

Science help illuminate what's safe dangerous, always translate easily rules set. already immunity. rocket science either masks effective everyone wears them. bare minimum unvaccinated. understand asymptomatic hopelessly stupid. Like probably mental illness unbelievably ignorant, get internet embarrassment human race lol. What? 99% people impacted? 80% 80+ age group vaccinated...so even think 80+ age group die vaccine close fully vaccinated... close... death fact people understand sad. want erectile disfunction, asthma heart conditions problems rest life. PhD candidate, also share ‚ÄúPhD scientist‚Äôs‚Äù perspective 100%. He‚Äôs also claiming masking effective vaccines. He‚Äôs saying overlapping layers protection still sensible even vaccine 94-96% effective variants USA right now. I‚Äôve fully vaccinated since March still wear mask time I‚Äôm outside home.

It would totally different banned international travel like NZ AU, haven‚Äôt, it‚Äôs matter time Indian variant ping pongs India country fly US from. Masking behavior also adds additional behavioral protections mix. can‚Äôt eat effectively mask, example, shown regions reopened indoor restaurants, reopening pre-vaccine caused largest spikes cases. Physical distancing, masking, vaccination still important know we‚Äôre going spike matter weeks new dangerous variant already killed vaccinated people India.

You also need realistically acknowledge CDC independent scientific body fact politically motivated organization. policy happening it‚Äôs chosen policy Biden Administration, full stop. Prolonging restrictions further, even sensible so, going favors Democrats mid-terms party made anti-masking hill die on. Biden eager hit set July 4th nationwide normalization date remove ammunition side‚Äôs campaigns. ...it may seem obvious, think point pandemic provided lot proof (ample opportunities study) ventilation needs looked airborne infections, like tuberculosis, measles chickenpox harder trace pathogens transmitted tainted food water, research past 16 months supports role aerosols play spreading pandemic virus.

That's happened. Really? place continuing masks least state updates us. remind clients keep wearing mask confusion. would hate lose business erring side caution wanting get shut health department (I personal services) people seem supportive.

Heavy restrictions curfews, tied lack vaccine preparation government sure fire way build lot animosity.  flip side, popped bubble (fully vax weeks now) even today walked street pick dinner downtown Chicago quite literally 90+% people wearing carrying masks still despite new CDC guidance. liked. 

Just issued updated guidance mean everyone *has to* stop wearing masks immediately. lot people keep so, either lingering worries, comfort, compassion around them. Actually, 1,359 (Per CDC website‚Ä¶ link below) fully-vaccinated people fact ‚Äúfucked up‚Äù covid.

I don‚Äôt try actively make people sick far i‚Äôm cleanly person world follow guidelines, plan wear mask forever, gosh can‚Äôt shake feeling get vaccine make extremely ill feel perfectly fine.  Agreed. Per cdc, obesity puts infected 3 times greater risk hospitalization. US among highest obesity rates world. Japan among lowest. think need learn [scientific works. See, there's difference making hypothesis concluding scientific law (basically proven fact.) CDC never claimed know sure do, literally impossible. Work got, draw conclusions later. Sometimes takes years, global crisis, ANYTHING THAT'S POTENTIALLY USEFUL INFORMATION SHARED.

Jesus Fuck, go ahead blame CDC wrong times they're assembly top trained minds world. Guess always perfect assessment, even lack significant data. Right? Guys...? still there???

Oh right, dead Covid follow precautions suggested people way smarter us. absolutely know people work home don‚Äôt feel particularly risk decided wait see vaccine goes A+ masking public every time feel that‚Äôs less risky them. 

Not personal take, certainly understand they‚Äôre coming from. Brilliant observation CDC's website says COVID less dangerous children flu Imagine one dude tested positive. I‚Äôd probably death bed something, feeling SUPER self conscious. üòÇ wonder changed recently. Could CDC issuing new guidance president making airwaves deliver news?  People lie? shit Sherlock living dystopian totalitarian state surveillance extends even body attracts you, exactly?   expert. But, people lie everything anything.. masks Wear KF94, KN95, N95. explicitly designed protect you. Combine social distancing. It‚Äôs completely legal enforce it. hard enough service people address before, impossible now. also teaching mask since August, clearly said it‚Äôs big deal. sure point is.    nut would want people would want working office? pay for:

* air conditioning

* heating

* coffee

* taxes

* rent

* cleaning bills

* plumbing

* liability insurance

* etc. add this: you‚Äôre 15 days past first mRNA vaccine, you‚Äôre *more* protected someone received J&amp;J shot. new CDC guidance doesn‚Äôt put believe vaccinations effectiveness risk, people unvaccinated unmasked harm risk unvaccinated around them. biggest concern kids age 12 still can‚Äôt get vaccinated regardless parents want not. shit? tell... think there‚Äôs big difference. wearing mask last spring could‚Äôve gotten anyone around sick. (Albeit quite small percentage based recent data mask effectiveness). Choosing follow guidance made likely spread virus. Now, wearing one even vaccinated absolutely zero harm spread virus. logical? No. perpetuating anxiety making people uncomfortable don‚Äôt wear one anymore? Yes. one get sick die choosing unnecessarily cautious now. people ineligible says shot safe people 12+. Note: PEOPLE 12+.

&amp;#x200B;

COVID basically zero threat 11 younger.

&amp;#x200B;

So, need determine whose company in. reason 3 types people

&amp;#x200B;

1. Vaccinated, arent affected whether mask distance
2. Little kids, arent risk covid
3. Voluntarily unvaccianted.

You choose protect group 3 want, see reason protect 3 minute visit CVS. want, public policy basically COVID-19 going change, starbucks.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I'm saying siad need wear mask. I'm saying reason require masks all, anti vaxxers already wearing vaccinated people cant spread disease. Working cop tourist area useful know rules people continually surprised handed ticket disobeying ""no animals"" laws despite exclaiming pet ferret viral health going sue pants (never got sued). 

The problem people clever enough lie, call dog (or, theoretically, miniature horse) service animal really way challenge it. Yes. Yes will. Percoets, molly percoets...... premise stupid. seems like saying person solving problems cannot encourage others part solution rather part problem. 

If thought driving car hurting people, I'd stop driving car. BTW, know antsy donate time money charity? seem make really strange assumptions sake defending anti-vax position. Why?  Yeah shit saw news January 6th. Duh That's expect happen. problem may solve itself. Unscrupulous anti-vaxxers lie? GTFO! Also several new sources scientists doubt US ever reach heard immunity due vaccine hesitancy. It‚Äôs early point know actual heard immunity percentage it‚Äôs expected 50-90%. This, unironically. Good freedom baby learn read Sorry hear that. young child sounds stressful.

My comment came insensitive know.

More referring literally refuse deny science behind vaccine. You‚Äôre good parent taking care son making sure he‚Äôs vaccinated whenever possible.  Sure lie. mostly wearing masks right start with. I'm going maskless wherever required. kinda ease it. :) lot people work worked restaurants bars point lives. shouldn‚Äôt hard find real life humans empathize Nah, pandemic bruh  I'm right 6 1.5 yrs old. Ok *really* want hear resulting workplace drama. 

remindme! 36 hours Masks also still required schools, per CDC guidance. Yup vaccines work. vaccinated act do. I‚Äôm fully vaccinated, anybody cares health likely vaccinated partially point. don‚Äôt really take precautions point, don‚Äôt wear mask don‚Äôt now. 

Just make sure people still quick access get vaccinated change mind.

If you‚Äôre vaccinated want be, careful usual get one ASAP. Next nobody allergic peg

You expecting believe hysteria vs literal government site warning particular?

Nah bro, think Im going go science based agencies one.

I find hilarious gotten unreasonable anti science again. I've always thought horseshoe theory stupid, might right extent.

I guess group think works. Eventually people wild even care core points group supposed about. groups out, aint 150% in, out.


What going 1 years time personality cant revolve around stop making excuses stupid people.

Yea bro. allergic something make anyone stupid. didnt say anything looking alternatives. certainly moral approach, seeing UK US getting ahead still getting lockdown extensions right move. vulnerable vaccinated, exports start go countries supply vulnerable done.

The really annoying thing even benefit geopolitically. Russia China gotten credit donating vaccines US ""hero"" calling useless patent waiver. Hopefully 1.8 billion Biontech doses we've ordered, change. I'm one 50 percent! vaxxed. Woot Woot! left Walmart mask drinking Coke  ""Experts"" gods spoken!!! Let us bow follow every bidding. There's way know future issues be, never claimed was. Thankfully, nobody paranoid Patty's care. Everyone going catch covid. Mitigation measures dont work. work shot. So, catch covid without shot maybe die, catch shot fine now. 

&amp;#x200B;

What happens future anyone's guess. think bad, feel free isolate yourself. society going makes rules based something bad possibly COULD happen sometime distant future. That's silly saying ought arrested today there's chance might murder someone 20 years Thought r/theonion moment.  Make sense, heard term thrown around. instance, hair stylist lady go little wacky said ""allergic"" vaccines (based prior experience ones childhood, specify though). doubt meter high. fully vaccinated month now. got say feels weird wearing mask everywhere. course will. Lying nature.  enforce flu shot every year. kids fine General eligibility opened April. everyone actually FIND appointment, competing everyone else clamoring shots.

I‚Äôm fully vaxxed I‚Äôm good service worker eligible back, husband became eligible April got appointment almost right away. gets second dose 3 days, wait 2 weeks fully vaxxed. 

No one became eligible April gonna fully vaxxed yet. didn‚Äôt CDC wait general public could fully vaxxed became eligible? It‚Äôs ludicrous.

Anyway, saying anyone isn‚Äôt already vaxxed isn‚Äôt gonna pretty dumb. lot people weren‚Äôt eligible recently. even need fake card, stores go dont check proof, smile walk in. Pandemic :-) Americans lie lol Teaching mask since early August. necessary step providing education pandemic.

Get yourselves.  lmao Hot take: 

I actually disagree people saying ""it's fine people want keep wearing mask makes feel safer. shame them.""

I think should. like beginning pandemic tried get people wear masks, people wearing masks shamed. we're trying get people back normal, safe fully vaccinated, people socially encouraged drop masks.


It important get back normal life, someone feels warm fuzzies ""virtue"" feel wearing mask mean look it. No, hope don‚Äôt. think shouldn‚Äôt let guard down. Canada, perpetually locked down. say, cares lie? people want risk getting covid that's choice. responsible people get vaccinated concern anymore. Definitely error, they've used 120% available doses 10 million US means incidence immunocompromised 1 35. source? [Published primary immunodeficiencies put closer 1 100k low end [1 2k] [1 makes 1 35 seem claim requires real source remotely believable without stretching secondary immunodeficiency encompass much meaningless category. 

I firmly believe everyone try vaccinated part. selfish avoid taking appear safe highly efficacious vaccines. less confident estimate prevalence immunodeficiency accurate. reaching point subjective decision becoming lot difficult people answer. someone family protect? I‚Äôm sure isn‚Äôt slightest reasonable expect others. someone trying start family? Yes. probably hard them. data yet initial vaccine course loses affect? Agree. looking forward great summer low rates, increasing vax numbers precautions keep kids safe. dial back keep away antimasker/vaxers. Every Facebook comments section full people boasting so, yeah. 

We are, always, mercy stupid selfish among us Why?   fly straight California, you‚Äôll fit dumb asses Today Obvious News... Why? Gold leader checking in‚Ä¶. Fuck‚Äôem  Science method, identity. Super random question animal small carry bag? don‚Äôt make habit planning grocery store trip ferret tow go lot places night way home day trip him, really needed milk also didn‚Äôt want leave car. suppose could gotten away it, bag looks like small gym bag something asleep I‚Äôm also rude still don‚Äôt milk lol. Could brought bag me? Nah. changed stance seems study hiw effective vaccines variants, came week two ago. Next nobody allergic peg, are, get J&amp;J. Again, stop making excuses stupid people. There's reason unvaccinated right now. Mask mandates never really enforceable, round here, plenty people unmasked months. Probably mostly sort people also refuse get vaccinated. Duh.

About 70 percent people store today masks. way 70 percent county vaccinated. Trusting science vital Right exactly. going back one. People mask advice last year virus brand new cause recommendation changed. Almost everyone lie. stick expertise infectious diseases pretend expert racism. Since germs racist? thing vaccines work well. Even without full herd immunity seems enough bring manageable levels. probably helps anti-vaccine anti-mask crowd already higher risk Covid. people know caught Covid anti mask/anti Vaxers. level protection already also. happens achieves immune escape? 

It ravage unvaccinated even more.

Have seen variant yet 100% end run around vaccines? It‚Äôs Americans best!  Everywhere go, people fully masked. like reverse psychology something. feel like used 50 percent people would see store. go, closer 75-80. I'm fully vaccinated still feel like go without it. Maybe blame selfish idiots refuse get free vaccine society back normal yet, many innocent people don‚Äôt want die needless preventable deaths? effective report? middle ground here. Either actually going weeks weeks without local transmission, like government claim, lets quickly trace contain small local outbreaks occur, virus endemic everywhere China. 

China densely populated interconnected undetected cases reported health authorities, rapidly spread throughout country via exponential growth. almost exactly two weeks May Day golden week national holiday nearly 300 million domestic trips made week, undetected cases, spread country now, like what's happening India right now. Fabric masks exist. Also one person wearing mask nothing compared societies obsession buying useless things, pollution caused corporations, amount waste medical environments done. CDC American specific, give health advice American situation, countries won‚Äôt vaccinated 2024. I've got bad news Brazilian variants. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* CDC Morbidity Mortality Weekly Report, current influenza vaccine 45% effective overall 2019-2020 seasonal influenza B viruses. Specifically, flu vaccine 50% effective influenza B/Victoria viruses 37% effective influenza A(H1N1)pdm09.

So flu shot 45% efficacy enough rest concerns disease much likely harm child need absolute protection different disease less threat?

I little hopes changing minds days come see difference way risks viewed.

*this literally copy paste comment posted elsewhere people keep saying this* I'm doctor scientist. CDC first said covid transmitted air recommend masks thought incorrect. said 6ft thought enough many situations. tell vaccinated people need masks, effectively giving everyone pass, even though half country vaccinated.  1) vaccinating children 2) vaccinating everyone else household 3) ensuring caregivers vaccinated. Like, maybe lot people don‚Äôt take flu seriously, took lot precautions baby old enough vaccinated (which March 2020 lol) Here's thinking long standing American tradition civil war over. traveling nothing mutating moving goalposts keep trying move argument get into. 

The CDC clearly lied least once. straight told us did. Lol üòÜhaha Ok bub  that's flu lower rate spread. estimated less 50 million contractions given year. Smart move actually. 

The unvaccinated catch covid variants like booster shots vaccinated people. vaccine recently means still active ready attack variants encountered idiot brigade.

Perfect! Obviously cdc trying thin herd. ( culling want) kind like thinning dumb ones.ü§™üòÉüëç didn‚Äôt say immune, extremely low risk live California, even people walking outdoors generally put mask pass them, seen anyone unmasked indoors months.

It's nice people taking things seriously, even marginal benefit pretty small point. (Cases *way* down, too!) Typical ignorant selfish rude uneducated fool actually something comment deleted it. 

Every industry, communications included, going dark period time fine tooth comb next century, I‚Äôm sure future generations figured exactly now. Unfortunately, Marty McFly taking FOREVER get answers üòÖ

I hope great week! beyond comprehension problem continuing wear masks indoors. Like get it, mildly uncomfortable, ears hurt end day struggle glasses fogging pushes nose enough mouth breathe due nasal polyps. think I've got possible complaints almost anyone (and think people need wear time identified favorite masks tricks alleviate now). 500% worth it, even vaccinated, means helping cases drop near zero result protection *everybody* critical time. People completely lose sight goal. Cases still ridiculously high US. low, relatively speaking, mainly thanks fortunate timing drop winter surge moreso vaccination campaign, hanging plateaued weeks still 10X per capita case rate Israel. see plateau R0=1 less-cautious shift behavior means start increase current parameter set. customer I've also loved neither us need make small talk either transaction, great! don‚Äôt bring out. don‚Äôt know people think they‚Äôre circumstances effect others. 

I‚Äôm fully vaccinated. I‚Äôm more. come India poverty children aren‚Äôt dying like Brazil? wonder people good insurance still drive carefully wearing seatbelts, doubting effectiveness seatbelts?

Also wonder people good driving would wear seatbelt first place. /s tactic act like small child trying lie deceive way winning argument. 

The CDC lie masks, turned around told us lied. know lied least once. Really, point, opportunities get vaccinated. didn‚Äôt get vaccinated don‚Äôt mask get sick that‚Äôs person's problem. 

Not problem person got vaccinated. 

So wear mask, wear don‚Äôt worry others. Yup, sooooooo nice sick year much usually am. I'm never going wear mask around people now! especially stores! people whatever care really enjoy extra protection make small talk people either expected smile old enough wear mask. feel like I'm living Idiocracy Oh, really?

This real life version it. can't heal stupid! trust science says vaccinated people need masks. 

Do trust science says 9-yo likely die flu covid? want Jim Bob wear mask every flu season well? also learned like masks protect things Covid.

Evidence first study long covid children suggests half children aged 6 16 years old contract virus least one symptom lasting 120 days, 42.6 per cent impaired symptoms daily activities. interim results based periodic assessments 129 children Italy diagnosed covid-19 March November 2020 Gemelli University Hospital Rome (medRxiv, doi.org/fv9t).

However, becoming¬†increasingly apparent large number children symptomatic asymptomatic covid-19 experiencing long-term effects, many months initial Nobody making read anything, much less click comment complain it. 

It‚Äôs odd behavior tbh. Fuck ‚Äòem. They‚Äôve chance made choice. know right! looking comments today, cannot understand upvoted others downvoted, despite basically saying thing. Seems stories coming people severe symptoms seeing noticeable improvements getting vaccine. read bit carefully.. half study 129 Italian kids. figure quoting UKs research. 

12.9% still massive number. like I'm living bizzaro world one cares kids get covid.  that‚Äôs unvaccinated taking risk wearing them. 

Maybe I‚Äôm missing point you‚Äôre trying make? That's expect full clinical trial complete. FDA (and likely will) issue EUA (Emergency Use Authorization) full trial complete, adults and, recently, People fire get burned. drive children cars? opposed do? like ignored case rates earlier; that's activity that's 1000% deadlier. I'm debating you, I'm sharing facts. Point lie. authority decides crisis mostly over, considered authority. confirm, honor system work. two issues think are: 1 - privacy, legality security issues surrounding sharing PHI

This huge. someone experience software dev systems administration, tell first hand much pain ass (and huge risk) handle PHI. much lose, usually little gain, going anywhere near PHI avoided whenever possible. sky blue? Surprised you‚Äôre downvoted oblivion....I find Reddit unpredictable. Flu season local hospitals staff tend to.wewr masks children except certain circumstances allowed visitors.  likely due fact one shared germs. people get moving mixing, germs. Yes, agree. supply massively outstrips demand, US could drop export restrictions instead calling pointless patent waiver. won't, considering long list states localities rolled back mask mandates direct response CDC guidance. Yes, actually saying escape variant -DOES- show up, masks going difference isolated control measures vs full lockdown. people like live apartment can't social distance landlord forcing contractors home renovations. problem everyone privileged enough true privacy. hear that. also dealing glasses fog year, life. It‚Äôs small sacrifice things considered. don‚Äôt want anyone else know end dead like brother friend mine severe cognitive impairment result Covid infection. guy 20, got covid ended brain fog bad drop college couldn‚Äôt focus remember reading class, living home, unemployed, driven local university every week mother observation researchers studying long-Covid cases. clue condition going improve, life already severely altered well could disabled life. yeah, that‚Äôs I‚Äôm eating out, flying Florida spring break, going without mask. There‚Äôs far many unknowns virus running around like there‚Äôs nothing wrong.

At time, heard NPR we‚Äôre 3% national cases attributed Indian variant, we‚Äôre literally actively rolling de-masking policy dangerous variant gotten foothold country. really comes age old saying America: ‚ÄúYou always trust USA right thing options exhausted‚Äù. nation popular interest taking sort precautionary policy measures inconveniences us unless it‚Äôs wrapped sort jingoism, faux-patriotism, racial/cultural fear-mongering. rest politically expedient reactionary policy cat bag. users sub? Probably nothing given users informed average.

The important thing article people vaccines could cause rare condition brush getting symptoms checked. Rare side effect mean impossible side effect. thing Walmart last night. went without mask literally person place without one fairly busy. ended wearing look like asshole pulling alone. (I've also fully vaccinated month now.) felt ill two weeks following vaccination doctor wanted see him. Hard believe that‚Äôs true, AZ side effects topic worldwide debate since middle March. don‚Äôt agree CDC lot stuff I‚Äôm glad making feel commonsense decision rewarded. really much reward appreciate same. bet Yes that's exactly immune system works. like flipping light switch 2 weeks second shot.

You could go Walmart scared, take charge yourself. thoughts significantly higher amount deaths among babies/children covid Brazil? @zogo13 - going back durian one. understand coming calling lie.

The article says durian saying. Yes 30 cases across Singapore significant amount total cases country. data seems relevant. Moderna similar Pfizer. mRNA vaccines roughly mRNA them. Pfizer effective Indian variant, there's reason assume significantly different Moderna. Certainly point one works way think better vaccine never coming covid never going away. can't resume life now, never will. know doctor personally told thinks CDC's decision stupid believe right now. He's one either.  Yikes. really live incredibly soft times. point survival fittest (smartest). Eventually problem going take care itself. us trust science sit back let happen. country met exact opposite. People (antivaxx) keep saying know ""someone"" took vaccine always add one those:

\- either died suffered serious ""side effects""

\- protect serious effects virus

\- ""friend"" extremely sick would never recommend

\- virus real would rather risk getting virus ""being vaccinated""

In end, matter say and/or do, people never wanted take vaccine never Really?! only. Science awesome, awesome, yet, right now. 

First, vaccine 95% protective, means initially 1% chance dying get Covid, 0.05% dying. great, population level, majority people don‚Äôt get vaccinated, vaccinated people still die/suffer unpleasant side effects. 

The true power vaccines lies herd immunity. Covid much less likely multiple vaccinated people (part less likely die but), therefore vaccinated people likely spread much fewer amount virus, limited amount virus, meets vaccinated people good resistance, even less likely take hold all, forth.

This doesn‚Äôt work virus spreads unvaccinated people, multiplies much faster, it‚Äôs likely mutate growth, larger doses virus likely spread disease, including vaccinated people. Well said Bring full subscription model. fair, billion dollar company produces vaccines, would also like sell continuously ‚ÄúAlways been‚Äù Holding Olympics absolute disgrace really puts perspective much money valued lives.

You can't tell least possible turns major vector mass transmission virus / variants.

Then get equity argument, many countries athletic associations opportunities train due pandemic. Goes completely spirit games. People already though.  understand people bring kids counter new mask policies, COVID barely affects them, kids going infect get sick? vaccinated, unlikely kid infect get sick, get sick, extremely unlikely it'll major harm vaccinated. Realistically, ones risk unvaccinated children unvaccinated parents/grandparents. Sometimes there's one problem. tackle two problems once. Average size pollen 25 microns. support wearing mask reduce amount pollen exposure.  

Your body, choice.  agree everything said don‚Äôt trust don‚Äôt trust recommendation. politically motivated. I‚Äôll wait til kids vax‚Äôd I‚Äôll still careful people caught bs antivax anti maskers lie. need infrastructure support community health education, major aspect public health lacking.  I'm sure that's even true, really matter. lightning strike exactly preventable. careful, increasing risk kids die. mention, lightning striking person extremely uncommon. disease hand capacity affect anyone comes contact with. proceed carefully, people continue die, like already have. Except time, it'll children dying misstep. So? F-those idiots. Ya think? vaccinated adults spread .

in rare case reduced infection vaccinated subject still can't infect anyone load small can't even spread within body let alone others, vaccine-educated immune system takes care it.

that's fully vaccinated need wear mask  post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

That's 50% effectiveness rate. course, kids likely die lightning strike covid. real lol sir, would rather die! math, Less 4 million people died last year deaths going go dramatically post vaccine. Maybe wearing mask know infected would equivalent drinking driving. There's intent cases. 

But lots things driving safest possible thing - people speed, rolling stops, even drive raining. I'm guessing least one things, add risk. Gaslight you? I‚Äôm proving wrong. want stick fingers ear hyper fixate information world shut anyone knew going guess convo over, cdc said masks, wasn‚Äôt lie, thought needed trying prevent Fauci told Washington Post , beginning COVID-19 pandemic, masks recommended general public, authorities trying prevent mask shortage health workers extent asymptomatic spread unknown. 

As information became available SARS-CoV-2, virus causes COVID-19, health authorities organizations around world changed stance towards impact face masks spread disease ( ). girlfriend cancer survivor immunosuppressant drugs. 3 years. 

Idk do.  feel trapped home masks required since live red area. pregnant women want wait later pregnancy get vaccinated. point, think it‚Äôs natural selection bad enough refuse even listen facts. 

 
They literally actively propagate *Fabrications* straight face. 

&amp;#x200B;

Like whole lives lieing.  feel way flu? Hope one confuses Sinovac, real-world results demonstrated incredible 94-98% absolutely. but... may vaccines good ones pretty soon ... 

and stuff beside COVID-19 mean hope Children 12 significant risk Covid-19. it‚Äôs people heard. says they'll lie? They'll probably tell medical history HIPPA ask them. Sadly there's likely truth even pandemic. claim rights trampled blah blah blah. understand, possible keep kid away unmasked people. walking past someone much risk.  Fully vaccinated still masking indoors potential crowds I'd rather additional risk amount people know higher risk. rather cautious not. Though happy hear could mostly skip mask exercising outdoors since heat masks recipe really horrible acne. basically, ""ok, antivaxers, we're getting this. sure want vaccine..."" US, employer enforce whatever want you, long touch protected class. really enjoy hardhitting facts coming lately . I‚Äôm pretty sure folks studying thought took consideration making recommendations. find via antibody test. Get N95 masks. 70-85% herd immunity stop virus, spread slows massively get closer. Wait, kind hospital workers run around without surgical masks pandemic? Even that‚Äôs case shouldn‚Äôt wait around people may may convinced ease restrictions concern long term affects COVID kid catch it. Flu around decades. Also kids low risk working vaccine them? It‚Äôs confusing message realize get spread covid vaccinated right?

And kids 12-16 fully vaccinated yet. got approved takes time vaccines work. Can't believe much ignorance exists country   water wet don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs That‚Äôs super misleading. Kids risk dying flu typical flu season covid. I‚Äôm pretty sure people never even understood either underlying mortality risk day day living prior covid sudden ‚Äúrisk‚Äù people don‚Äôt put perspective. really horrifying, thanks chiming in.

There magic day safe. magic day unsafe. 

Safety risk big sliding scale. got little riskier going year ago little risk sliding back slowly.  


Do worry days go. great weather, go enjoy without mask smile people. course, church full antivaxxers, disease spread amongst population. Yes, racism exists US. r/redditmoment Wales seen wastage levels different rest UK, made much difference. I'm vaccinated. I'm worried me. want virus GONE. Searched ""cdc mask mandate press release"", clicked first link 2020, read first line ""CDC says masks effective controlling covid. 

I'll honest, maybe dont know ""effective"" means, I'm pretty sure sentence saying ""masks dont work"". love people without kids tell people kids things. Sounds like excuse I‚Äôm saying kids shouldn‚Äôt vaccinated CDC place. year plus told us known risk kids exponentially low. risk spread virus, hospitalized, die much lower adults.

Yet perception kids vaccinated aren‚Äôt safe. get parent makes decision caution, think telling kids wear mask vaccinated bit cruel. say hasn‚Äôt goal vaccinate certain percentage people cases become really low, wed lift restrictions?

The percentage vaccinate seems unknown. estimates don‚Äôt fully factor virus likely clue Never parent ask flue shot. ever seen REASONABLE request sick go near baby parents. store technically still requires it, we‚Äôve never really enforced customers wearing masks there‚Äôs point arguing it. slightly adults going maskless normal, like 25% kids wearing masks. good hear. horrible seeing children wearing masks hours like that. Especially since affects less severe flu. masks nothing aerosol virus. wonder long term, negative consequences masks health be. wear obviously, also know exposed germs makes immunity. Like, pregnant woman lives cat, cat much germs builds unborn babies immunity 40% less likely allergies. wonder people lot prone getting sick mask wearing now.   original comment gave impression variant question causing higher proportion breakthrough infections infections contagious. reality, sources linked said neither. 

I wrong say total lie, obfuscation. sometimes Reddit best go clarity purposes. know I‚Äôm small minority people severe allergic reaction first dose can‚Äôt get second (or possibly boosters), kind stories make feel like shit. I‚Äôm trying fully vaccinated. body bit crazy. I‚Äôm still rashes hives nearly 6 weeks first shot. isn‚Äôt normal response, they‚Äôre basically telling go fuck despite doctor two NPs telling get second. turned away hospital went second dose still reaction. showed up, it‚Äôs fault get sick people can‚Äôt honest *their * vaccination status. Look numbers masked unmasked populations. Covid care. would suggest blaming others instead move life forgot peoples different approach virus. never time CDC told medical professionals wear mask dealing covid patients. took minute find source first week March 2020 saying wear them. wasnt recent announcement I'm sure I'd able find something earlier existed. point 50 deaths us even early covid saying masks medical staff. can‚Äôt. understand it‚Äôs unreasonable stop society there‚Äôs vaccine infants it‚Äôs 18 months everyone working multiple jobs 1800 opportunities children vaccinated personally visited mobile vaccination lab 30 times case. 

Not everyone does, tide turning adults resuming somewhat normal lives, we‚Äôve inevitably reached ‚Äúwon‚Äôt think kids?‚Äù phase proceedings. 

Parents need parents PARENT children. you‚Äôre concerned, job keep children home, stay home well ‚Äúeven vaccinated people spread COVID‚Äù something hear day long. 

Sorry. venting. It‚Äôs long 14 months. trust national nurses union, came statement vehemently opposing new CDC mask guidelines. actually clade strain virus. public understand word ""clade"" officials say ""variant"" instead, avoid saying ""strain"" wrong virology terms.

Strain like two different strains flu requiring different flu vaccines. reason vaccine works different coronavirus variants variants different clades, different strains. It‚Äôs going feel comfortable shedding mask public places, even mask mandates cease despite fully vaccinated. can‚Äôt wait travel see fully vaccinated friends spend time inside hug people again. 

It adjustment period baby steps, I‚Äôm glad trending direction. Yep lol. Every Trump rally, BLM march, terrible ideas. stayed home. No. asking care them. asking treat like fellow humans. hope so! wife moving Germany late July. Hoping get vaccine sometime Aug life closer normal then. Considering people getting vaccinated large dying rate .1% less covid, think correct. wiill however get natural immunity likely spread are... get government issued card show it. I'm Vegas, got Friday. So, super new information. still large majority wearing masks. today, I'd say 60 % maskless. lots chin carrying it. strange thing walk really crowded space without mask. would chin wearer pulls situation. small shops restaurants still ask keep on. weird thing. I'm fully vaccinated while. got used breathing people's spaces. think weeks many masks Nevada. (live here, Vegas). I‚Äôm pregnant, likely HG, struggle keep fluids down. ineligible vaccine I‚Äôm able nauseous vomiting 24/7. I‚Äôve already cancel one appointment booked get it. think based science - think made decision bit early. think waited another month two could tell everyone it‚Äôs safe take masks cases spread would extremely limited. However, hard believe solely science based decision took many states businesses surprise actual numerical evidence proportionally higher mortality among children Brazil. lot media garbage. Brazil‚Äôs outbreak totally uncontrolled, leading overburdened healthcare system could longer provide adequate care. Combined sheer number infections, lead unfortunate casualties 

Stop replying ‚Äúwhat‚Äôre you‚Äôre thoughts x subject‚Äù you‚Äôre deceitful using excuse argue spread misinformation Oh real??üòê get n95. They‚Äôre short supply anymore went movies first time since February 2020 Saturday. Wrath Man OK, popcorn amazing. allow get vaccinated? I've heard seen anything official anyone purposely getting vaccine. even recommended cancer HIV patients. immune system wants kill well. particularly like intestines. No. not. virus spread places wear masks places equal rates. Blaming 'others' virus exactly thing politicians want us take attention away tehir horrible policies. Don‚Äôt argue idiot, it‚Äôs waste time :/ know people claiming wearing mask going science.

Probably anti-mask along, latest rationalization they're them. I'm business usual, seems back Trump's plan herd immunity infection, could keep masks like 90% back normal well behind us. hope wrong, natural infection immunity + vaccinated enough stop exponential growth seems like gambling. ""personal responsibility"" crowd really thinking hospitals capacity unvaxxed sick people, might get bed heart attack. affects everyone. going ICU nurses left this, PTSD/lack support already causing leave droves. read article Reddit bastion truth huh I'm 99% sure one someone trolling. done poor job communicating entire time. lied us manipulate actions. held far long nearly every decision made data showed wrong. still explained mask policy use effect covid rates. untrustworthy. NUH UH U 99.9% per cent PEOPLE GO I. SUN DONT GET SUNBURN!!!1 UR RESEARCH vaccinated people almost threat spreading others anymore would need wear mask protect people process getting vaccinated? people aren‚Äôt going get vaccinated didn‚Äôt wear masks first place didn‚Äôt wear correctly nothing really new (other small portion population can‚Äôt get verified, legitimate medical reason). want conspiracy videos Europe,. quarantine mandatory self enforced. lo people spread virus. Mandatory quarantine facility option. know this. ""18 under"" demographic seen 300 covid deaths. 500k covid deaths US.

So ""under 18"" 0.06% covid deaths represent 24% US population. think safe say huge risk dying covid. zero far far less general adult population. think em millions forgot...... bizarre Plenty sources. fact, go find press release CDC posted started mask mandate. There's good 25 citations start with. new science. Paul making point defiant Fauci couple months ago. So....she believes Covid enough think wearing mask getting vaccinated result death, also believes vaccine cannot trusted?

10/10 logic you‚Äôre adult, you‚Äôre worried around unmasked people, get vaccinated. Even two weeks past first dose good protection. care extent care living creature, there's much save someone ignorance. hope vulnerable people can't get vaccine got whatever reason suffer idiocy. Beyond that... Seems like they've decided play Russian roulette lives. Good luck them.  thought process well, sure vaccinated people risk, still people want vaccinated able so.  Better safe sorry. Forcing unvaccinated people wear masks good thing virus knocked out. Numbers going several states last week. We're exactly clear here. Expect rise next month. Yes. wierd. Mandatory hotel quarantine ways. real way make sure people travelling unnecessary reasons. I've read, true.  fb friend posted 8 deaths per day U.K. vaccinations... can‚Äôt argue stupidity. I'm concerned protecting antivaxxers. young get vaccine yet (or approved week) immunocompromised vaccine fully effective for. shit felt way late last summer looked data decided go real world too. CDC said fact. Fully vaccinated people small chance getting covid and/or passing others. However, true, states start lifting mask mandates entirely (as they've already started do) even say ""fully vaccinated people need wear mask, unenforceable relies mostly honor system. governor state, would lift mask mandate good portion state (I'd say least 60%) fully vaccinated. that, would keep mandate. Outside getting vaccine, possible certain people like children, wearing mask easiest way reduce spread covid. We're pandemic yet. still hundreds millions billions risk am.

They'll end immune. Teir immunity probably lower 2 mRNA injections, big deal: choice... get sick second time get better, better, etc.

Society able get back ""normal"" vaccine-induced immunity sickness-induced immunity add soon virus find many people infect, circulate slowly (this starting happen US EU countries).

Immunity escape thing, probably problem made choice go natural immunity, big problem current variant totally escape immunity, natural vaccine-induced one. Funny brain works, huh? I‚Äôm right ya.

Pretty much anyone dislikes masks general probably deep seated unexplored dislike Asians. Many American men see Asian men effeminate, ‚ÄòAsian‚Äô things like mask wearing transitive property makes feminine. Ask anyone doesn‚Äôt like masks they‚Äôll probably mention it‚Äôs something *over there* never **over here**. It‚Äôs racist dog whistle, subtle one. Feel little weather, still need go out? Wear mask. Work service job interact *fuck tons* people? Wear mask reduce spread anything. guarantee local restaurant‚Äôs staff near ‚Äòstomach bug‚Äô pass everyone, maybe you‚Äôve food poisoning catching them. Masks could help stop that. 

Everyone doesn‚Äôt wear time, normal acceptable see around. CDC director: yeah fuck kids 12 like you. 33% fully vaccinated rate enough basically lift mask mandates. tied specific vaccination percentage, like 70% Scientists saying March 2020 earlier. Authorities slow react. go back status quo allowing people make decisions put vulnerable populations risk celebrate return normalcy. anything particularly effective address declining childhood vaccination rates put populations risk injury death diseases like measles, hardly shocking would take level inaction COVID-19. 
 
It's disappointing. alternative making systemtic changes increase vaccination rates, decrease poverty housing instability, make healthcare accessible affordable, one seems care that. get back spending money shit need without mask on. CDC director: F kids immunocompromised, even fully vaccinated rate 33% let's go unmasked. CDC getting dumber day Yup based solely science,

Every one knows scientific process

They've hypothesized vaccines effective.

And right ""experimental"" stage. Let‚Äôs nature run it‚Äôs course Sanofi+novavax complete portfolio 6 major vaccines. Hopefully 3-4 billion doses doled next year clue why. He's friend, yet ask ""why not""?

Well. F kids 12, CDC director  work away home area year long waiting lists daycares. You‚Äôre person aimed at. 

Their point people danger non-maskers non vaccinated people MA, VT, CT  promoting take masks? mean employ least 1 person knows thing two human behavior, least hope do. statement vaccinated people able take masks jeopardizing efforts world. People tend read official important medical thingy said could take masks dropping vaccinated part way step back statement one out. Anti maskers usually brightest people jump anything even CDC releases statement suits - countries US lots people comply masks. people stuff like waiting for. OP‚Äôs comment literally didn‚Äôt say though? literally said that‚Äôs ‚Äúfine want that‚Äù. Someone else who‚Äôs fully vaccinated wearing mask judgement personal practices. Breakthrough infections normal occurring even wild type B.1.1.7. There've least thousand US already. expected.

None vaccines 100% effective. Especially preventing mild moderate symptoms.

So scientists researching variant around world saying ""The vaccines still work variant."" probably still work. No. 1 including every single child 12. unenforceable vax/no vax mask rules, I'm hard time thinking indoor public setting isnt risky children now.  would say good riddance start breeding new variant resistant vaccines?? still hurt us all... Well Republicans aren‚Äôt getting vaccine...that means less Republicans. see issue this. One whole year pretty well accepted theory... Given low uptake US, pandemic you. Indian strain starts spread cause huge surge unvaccinated, cause large number hospitalisations deaths vaccinated. Public Health England's surveillance suggests AZ Pfizer 95% protective hospitalisations two doses. enough virus circulated, huge number old people who've doses suffer severe symptoms. need uptake US you. parent. children grown. remember like little relied everything. know would situation. I‚Äôm sure plan too.

One thing isn‚Äôt going effective CDC issue guidance expect rest vaccinated country going put masks. Vaccinated people don‚Äôt need them. Unvaccinated people may lie get sick. thing people aren‚Äôt already vaccinated probably aren‚Äôt going get vaccinated announcement, they‚Äôre going mask-down pretend like vaccinated too. going result non-vaccinated people getting sick, spreading others cannot get vaccinated (ie allergies, children, immunodeficient, etc).

The next weeks quite telling effective policy. see surge cases without big uptick additional vaccinations know policy failed. anyone listened yet? Yeah I'm confused mostly coincided full additional group getting it... Like roll mask removal alongside new group vaccinated? least let get first. really odd timing Yeah, thoughts back Feb ‚Äò20 zipped smaller scale disaster Asia saw first SARS, foregone conclusion SARS-CoV-2 airborne.

Fuck 'em. discussion scientific communication scientific report, reports abused disinformation campaigns. There's enough data two doses AstraZeneca yet. However, given AZ Pfizer 80% protection death one dose according Public Health England's surveillance, seems likely vaccines work similarly. latest estimate PHE made 95% protection hospitalisations two doses AZ. 100%, Italian study correlate observed UK. That‚Äôs almost hilarious dire. CDC incompetent start, even without Trump‚Äôs undermining. organization clearly hasn‚Äôt adequately stress tested mobilization capabilities, add role politics choosing making decisions, it‚Äôs clear organization inadequately run.

Moderna actually rejected trial feels like there‚Äôs data purpose. take: people never gonna get vaxed still wont. people fence will, plus Pfizer FDA approval help bit That's pretty lame. vaccines great, I'm sure think they're accomplishing openly boasting putting risk. 

While they're fine now, winter comes along they'll first line immunity natural way. consequences pandemic could spark economic boom major proportions governments band together enforce buildings codes people much less packed together before. 

Just think toilets. know virus aerosolized infected person flushes. contain that? Obviously, toilets know would disappear. would require lot space individually isolated cabins, source fresh air. sounds like much better work environment business spaces today. 

The next abomination go would open workspaces people packed together like cattle. 

Then would new HVAC systems designed purify air continuously, efficiently &amp; minimal maintainance. 

All innovations would mean fantastic economic boom would rush deprecation old buildings, encourage building new spaces, replace HVAC, etc. 

Last certainly least, would better workplaces, designed certain respect personal space instead animal-farm-like spaces today. would people wear masks outside point? news, water wet. saying ~35k individuals die leave loved ones behind every year flu important? masking + school shut flu season + work home orders + indoor capacity restrictions flu season bring number way it? limit wearing masks?

I agree that, argument made much made wearing masks flu season. Hindsight 20-20. new virus. Yep, reacted ways. I'd rather gamble ok. last year terrifying. I‚Äôm don‚Äôt see need go people making harmless choices help feel safe. 

You want wear mask, it. It‚Äôs got nothing me.  there‚Äôs way happen. 

There‚Äôs thing extremely low anything talking extremely contagious virus. 


That completely unknown comes variants.. 

That‚Äôs factually proven. No. That‚Äôs incredibly stupid. vaccine killing 8 people day U.K. would terrible idea people get it. Sorry anyone young healthy would better odds beating covid beating vaccine. 
Thankfully that‚Äôs complete bullshit ones dying vaccine kids?  northeast worked hard crush curve early last spring, knew worked stop it. Still, cases rose red states relaxed restrictions summer, exploded fall, particularly thinking Iowa, South, North Dakota. Maryland live, without initial wave pretty stellar. 

Granted, winter surge places, driven people stayed home hunkered down, overwhelmingly liberal response. lie anything world lost mind started talking denying jobs freedom travel, like grocery store. That's well good pointless argument lift mandate expect within month least domestic travel oh god, heard mother yesterday still can't get it! told vaccinated anything last 40 years (while working retirement home... old, oftentimes sick vulnerable people...) yet one left standing people vaccinated every little thing dead. just... kind logic that? frustrates end. goal not, never been, prevent every possible case COVID. goal keep manageable levels vaccine, avoid overwhelming health care system meantime. we're now. University, Apple Watch commercial? Kinda like whoever said double masking effective. shit. precautions recommended experts don‚Äôt need wear mask anymore. You‚Äôre one problem, me. Kids also statistically risk anything here, stop using try make vaccinated people mask subjectively feel better. Well, hardly anyone gotten flu year. That's something factor in. left headlight effective right one, remove right one?

BTW: Double masking !!!REDUCE!!! probability !!!YOU!!! infecting !!!OTHERS!!! ! Time natural selection work it‚Äôs magic! Exactly. definitely worth noting ""Identify as"" longer something used relation gender. I've seen term used on, instance, questionnaires relation everything race to, even head-scratchingly, nationality. I'm sorry, realize American option start ""identifying as"" Icelandic. 

The overuse term, completely inappropriate contexts, trying ""woke"" precisely shirt funny. still understand vaccinated people problems CDC businesses implementing policies. arguments I've seen either straight unreasonable expectations people doomsday scenarios almost definitely happen. I'm going continue wear mask large crowds can't avoid public transit. get groceries delivered, curbside pickup never interact anyone wearing mask. Yes.

Cocks Hombre, freedom.

Clothes aren‚Äôt natural! 

We born naked god intended.

Wait, buildings aren‚Äôt natural either, internet, people online stores? person replied way knowing vaccinated maskless. anti vaxxers problem. Weirdly accusatory post...how pressuring people putting others danger? I'm simply saying bloke two vaccines, double masking shopping goggles indefinitely look bit mad everyone opportunity get vaccine. nurse know anything vaccines? I'm shocked. news, water wet. feel like everyone forgets point born yesterday even think lie state announced lifting requirements 2 weeks now. I'm 2 days away 2 weeks second shot. I'll wear mask till then. business still mask requirements, I'll wear mask there. really see big deal here.  It‚Äôs still good number always 16 states don‚Äôt report? Always 16 different. Like said, it‚Äôs good regardless usually like looking mid-week get accurate sense. cases going saw term ‚ÄúBubble Boy‚Äù Twitter absolutely describes loony. mean literally pull vaccine box give you, regardless race. It‚Äôs like nurses saying ‚Äúuh oh, got another one, better open box tainted vaccines black people.‚Äù understand historical precedent give vaccine order sit chair Idk 50 people agreed post? people edge going influenced get vaccinated this: people think ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs even point getting vaccine can‚Äôt want after‚Äù

If genuinely believed (I don't, nonsensical) correct way would blanket lift restriction pray everything works out. correct way would local/state/federal departments dangle reward good behavior. instance, governor could announce ""All restrictions lifted 75% population vaccinated"". would give carrot stick looking without idiotic middle ground one knows rules are, people go around lying status, spreading disease reason. reason wear mask fully vaccinated. like fb claim 10s cases miscarriage vaccination. People know fooled. looked data, percent miscarriage amoung vaccinated unvaccinated women same. Vaccines don‚Äôt cause miscarriage, don‚Äôt don‚Äôt prevent either. Shocking know. Screw kids immune compromised people guess. can‚Äôt go anywhere safely. Nah, what's dumb highlighting miniscule risk equally miniscule risks take everyday kids. Lived one, surprise surprise 90% people still wore masks anyways.... said thing today.  ‚Äúno masks‚Äù done soon!  Even got first shot soon able yet fully protected waiting period 2 2 weeks post second shot.  huge f part CDC.  Also, people don‚Äôt get vaccine (me) immunocompromised issues (as said) waiting either feel comfortable risks data available.  think masks doors proper protocol, masking areas lot people gather still place, IMHO.  make sense allow non-maskers go theater indoor event like convention still say masks public transportation still required?  again, policy MAKES SENSE want peruse post history, I've criticized CDC multiple times pandemic. example, continued emphasis fomite spread long became relatively apparent low risk vector pointless. fact CDC late game recommending masks (yes, remember concern ""taking masks away healthcare workers"", still) silly given *almost certainly* right thing based experience respiratory illnesses including closely-related coronaviruses like one caused SARS. weirdly inconsistent messaging around schools (and again, policies within.. like sanitation theatre).. on. 

On ""most intimate form COVID restriction policy"" - owners gyms, restaurants, theatres, venues well people work would definitely disagree assertion capacity restrictions ""no big deal"". 

And already said ""big deal"" was. issue policy enforceable. would absolutely love unmasked around bunch vaccinated individuals (via passport system similar). that's case. inherently unenforceable recommendation. That's issue. Must regional difference restaurants enclosed kitchen. Either wear mask (depending you‚Äôre going) take days drive &amp; stay hotels along way. said ‚Äújust Im vaccinated doesnt mean can‚Äôt spread it‚Äù pointing regardless herd immunity etc vaccinated individual extremely extremely low risk transmission people like you, people feel pressured put others danger can't / could yet vaccinate.  Basically yes. scientific process ‚Äúdraw spreadsheet‚Äù ‚Äúget 10 international experts room arrive consensus.‚Äù first study published, 3 may objections state limitations seven would agree reasonable. fact limitations written papers experts extrapolate beyond written. 

As months continue additional studies address limitations eventually whole team agree evidence collectively there. virus crazy, seems country safe all. I'm waiting segment society permanently angry start making videos challenging people wearing masks. people claiming personal freedom go maskless. people cannot take vaccine allergic reactions health issues. people would get shot would help legitimately cannot. Can‚Äôt please all, see. could waited five months people would still find reason say it‚Äôs early. Good riddance  16 months people still know this? sort doubt CDC news flash going wake point. children aren‚Äôt vulnerable.

Less 300 deaths covid people US 17. 300 deaths too! ‚ÄúDr. Walenksy revealed subtle marked shift agency‚Äôs emphasis community individual protection.‚Äù

We longer need them. remember case went Supreme Court gay couple wanted wedding cake Christian bakery bakery said ‚ÄúNo‚Äù? Supreme Court ruled favor Christian bakery private business serve anyone everyone. private business choose rules implement. holds true masks. store wants keep mask requirement place legal precedent based Supreme Courts ruling favor bakery denying cake. That‚Äôs true, many voices public health start saying outdoor transmission rare, ignored senseless policies enacted policed create harm. 

While true one hurt continued masking people want it, hate ‚Äúit‚Äôs choice‚Äù argument since personal freedoms limited much throughout past year people. Self preservation? vaccinated safe. unvaccinated gambling won‚Äôt catch deadly disease. think many parts US ever hit 70-80% vaccinated always been. opinion science backing it. not. Got second dose saturday, continue wear masks several months. Ok‚Ä¶ one questioning that. 

All scientists acknowledging never reach herd immunity anti-vaxx idiots. 

Meaning public masks might awhile won‚Äôt ever reach herd immunity.  fact got downvoted maddening. 

It *literally* fastest mutating virus know of. humans, least. Doesn‚Äôt literally every patient unique strain? everybody understands decreased risk preferable bigger risk.

Well half nation drinking q Kool aid. got real problems. Dead people risk rotting. going restart whole pandemic. vaccines somehow managed become less effective it, there's chance. said, US perfect place happen now.

Cases moderately increased 55% population one dose.

They talking delaying next easing measures two weeks, decided against. They're longer lockdown, still restrictions place.  Semantics. COVID era United States obviously militaristic anything like that, required pretty notable lifestyle shifts virtually every single citizen country and, opinion, never going time scientific community would unanimously feel comfortable walking precautions back. much matters. 66% effect total prevention 100% becoming serious illness. That's number really matters. Let's calm bit here. excessive? Yeah, probably bit. mentally ill? Come dude, way impact life? Let people want do.

If anything, people like ongoing problem we're going run into. One silver linings come normalizing wearing mask; would done wonders flu cold season felt sick. no, people like already resorting shaming people careful. vape flow freely mask obstructed?

I bet it‚Äôs obstructed. Masks aren‚Äôt complete barrier limit distance droplets spread. tough. think we'll get pretty quick we've dipped toes water.  Forever? Covid free countries done vaccinating year next, added benefit worry overwhelmed hospitals like. news, turkeys risk end November   ‚Äúlogic‚Äù says breakthrough infections proof vaccines don‚Äôt work, vaccinated stupid ‚ÄúI still 5% chance getting it!‚Äù (Even though that‚Äôs works) 

A lot people insanely ignorant referring unvaccinated kids, certainly safe, Breakthrough cases rare, rare statistics would imply. breakthrough data reporting subpar industrialized requires voluntary reporting data. 

The CDC actually [gave trying track breakthrough cases end shifted focusing cases result hospitalization death likely reported. context, end April 9245 breakthrough cases 835 hospitalizations - hospitalization rate 9% cases. Given increased protection hospitalization typical COVD hospitalization rates, implies 5-7X undercount breakthrough cases relative typically reported cases (and undercount actual cases - already undercounted 3-4X). 

Still incredibly effective, advertise bad data either (the statistic already bad enough reflective efficacy rather timebound risk constantly shifting variables: community case loads number fully vaccinated people days).

I agree unlikely person knows three people breakthrough cases. said, OP works long term care facility and/or exposed lot elderly folks, impossible. representative sample population. elderly likely breakthrough cases immune response vaccines severely reduced. Based Israel studies back risk-matched pairing still possible, efficacy hospitalization 87% elderly populations. Hopefully stays trend. would 8 year old need vaccine? Sigh spreading localised clusters, seemingly replacing Kent variant rather addition to. Overall infection rates especially changed hospital occupancy still dropping.  Top headline right now:

**Experts flag unintended consequences new mask guidance**

Followed by:

**The US ushered quick return normalcy weekend, experts say fast** 

**CDC mishandled rollout new mask guidelines, Dr. Gupta says** 

**Some people still need mask even vaccinated. one them?** 

**Opinion: sake children, keep wearing mask**

I'm starting feel like federal gov't needs implement actual de-programming initiative we're suffering Pandemic PTSD many people simply never going get able return normal. people start giving weird looks probably change.  going get sick via exposure vaccinated individual. Unvaxxed still wearing masks per CDC. Granted, mean _will_ wearing masks they're selfish assholes always case. Enjoy gold try fucking funny next time, fuck. Theres big suprise  hope never bring kids car, plane, rollercoaster. Never know might happen! Unmmmmm gonna happen Nah, people understand math large.

It's 95% effective cases would gotten COVID-19. That's number comes from. likely hit nerve administration. heal takes time. fair, really hard establish vaccination clinics agreements it.. one reasons Japan struggling vaccinate people. 
They Good plans either national level local level distribute vaccines.
Only limited number health professionals Japan administer vaccines despite process putting vaccine someone's arm trainable.

And tentative logistic plans failing, attempts make websites make appointments phone lines make appointments quickly get overwhelmed local level there's good execution handle this. Like example local governments tried set website registration gets quickly overwhelmed much traffic

Japan much failing implementing flexibility, funding, guidance this, local government entities failing implementing vaccination clinics. think important living surfaces claim dies announcement. end unnecessary sanitation efforts.  mean pushed mask agenda year, certainly hope case? news, water wet. went approx. 10% didn‚Äôt masks. enough time update signs adopt new guidance. think anything wrong that, want keep wearing masks power them.

Around 30% population (Gallup poll) think chance hospitalization due COVID infection 50% up.

Overestimating danger, especially spite hugely effective vaccines, likely cause full economic recovery lag far behind actual end pandemic people keep quarantine habits far past point usefulness. I'm sure mean, nobody wore masks hospital pandemic unless patient front declined flu shot. Yep do. kid 12 get vaccinated. they‚Äôre 12 they‚Äôre even lower risk. disgusting Captain fucking obvious here. true.... Let's wait calling Taiwan inadequate serious death problem like India. Taiwan lockdown still possible fix problem. I'm really starting believe well stupidity bottomless. waters taste oh good way people could've imagined. Bold assume unvaccinated ever masked first place know that, giving 5 months get least closer herd immunity would prudent. Biden TV basically calling feels awful lot like George w Bush ""Mission accomplished"" background. far early. even article?  That's something find crazy every time go US : windows can't open, can, like 2-5cm that's it. 

In office meeting room, fine building ventilation . hotel ! Getting fresh air night room ? nope, lot hotel old A/C unit noisy meaning unplug sleep. wife going work today office setting without mask first time forever (fully vaccinated w/ Moderna). She‚Äôs VP many hats, boss CEO, others pretty high vaxxed. people vocal enough known take vaccines company. 

She proofed sent weekend updated policy clearly reiterates CDC changed guidance to. clearly communicated employees fully vaccinated (meaning two weeks second dose two weeks J&amp;J shot) wear mask distance. also clearly reiterated mean mask mandate still place vaccinated updating State mask guidelines change. states employees asked move forward good faith status health workplace good company.

Now one might hear policy think teeth. assure characteristics/personality Traits higher company really really really dislike dishonesty. wife talking least next three four weeks unless something drastically changes state level tremendous pressure taken position vaccine particular setting either:
 A- keep wearing mask everybody else 
B- Get vaccine done shenanigans 

These bosses big personal character professionalism. It‚Äôs good workplace lot mobility opportunity bonuses available need stay bosses.  unvaccinated person would think twice walking around without mask there.  might never someone say word noticed. It‚Äôs lowest case count Sunday‚Äôs since around March/April last year.  vaccines work it. one worried Someone asked answered question? MA'AM, DOOOIIIIIINGGGGGGG???????!!!!!!!!! keep masking aren‚Äôt vaccinated. That‚Äôs guidance. anti science wear mask though even vaccinated. Especially new variant that's coming up. Scotland, vaccinated people hospitalised due new variant. half vaccinated fully vaccinated. low numbers moment less half population still vaccinated. new variant going spread. ages eligible vaccine would guess, Aug covid numbers 10k cases day Oh next door cesspool. won‚Äôt see surge vaccinations still going up. people may still get sick due wouldn‚Äôt otherwise. happened trust experts? stores, airports, public places start asking us show vax cards use facilities. helping people refuse get vaccine, there‚Äôs nothing now.

Pretty sure that's want coworker lose aunt uncle covid.

‚ÄúThe doctors said covid know wasn‚Äôt. sick wanted make covid deaths‚Äù

Another got covid coughed blood days finally returned month later 

‚ÄúYeah it‚Äôs nothing mask thing dumb. mean I‚Äôm fine now.‚Äù

First hand experience isn‚Äôt universal cure brainwashing let's see study then, show hard researched data ""uselessness masks"" ""Unvaccinated People Risk Unmasking"" Honestly see titles like come comments know there's still hope.

Thank say that. Yet people masks vaccines... I‚Äôm trying shame anything, would urge keep considering vaccine option. sound like genuinely want keep others safe, irrationally high fear vaccine side effects, reality you‚Äôre far likely get COVID experience bad long-term effects that. Yes ‚Äúaren‚Äôt broken‚Äù now, vaccine preventative measure, always risk catching COVID, forever. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt shake feeling‚Äù sounds like anxiety me, might benefit talking doctor and/or mental health professional learn potential risks likely are, help get past fears. appreciate you‚Äôre best keep safe, don‚Äôt want potentially get nasty virus afraid something proven safe. also care otherwise theyd gotten vaccine. Maybe let people live lives point. Yeah else gonna talk about? cash cow left office four months ago What's rate long covid among mild covid infections? talking here? 1% mild covid cases? 10%? 50%? Good. Maybe people continue ignore CDC we'll actually reasonable response this. 

Continue wear masks indoors despite vaccine status we've achieved herd immunity. masks caused increased case counts, testing caused  else? Pfizer's Europe manufacturing line works 50% world &amp; 50% Europe. one line, US, days ago served US exclusively. provide doses Canada &amp; Mexico that's it. I‚Äôm vaccinated doesn‚Äôt mean can‚Äôt spread it. understand right??

It means likely won‚Äôt get again. 
But definitely spread everywhere go. 

Therefore aren‚Äôt vaccinated wear mask. know idiots lie say got vaccinated didn‚Äôt spread everywhere. 

I don‚Äôt think understand spreads. 

Again dealing dumbest dumb comes anti-vaxx crowd need treat like drunk toddlers. operate assumption we‚Äôre aware variant means it‚Äôs US bit time. Humor also subjective, something seem lacking. Nice see adapt science!  main reason still wearing mask, least whenever I'm inside place busy outside. I'm fully vaccinated people cannot get vaccine, want protected, too. Also children can't get vaccines yet either. hoping mask mandates etc would lifted population vaccinated, are. 

I also like feeling I'm going incognito mode mask lol mean, imagine long term similar flu.

Some get vaccinated, not. People get sick covid die, depending variant traveling around time. like flu.

Over time, healthcare system adapt periodic surge covid hospitalizations deaths. They'll get better meds place care people get sick, fewer die.

Ultimately, vaccine remains extraordinarily effective, covid continue ravage communities refuse vaccinate. I‚Äôm gonna miss smiling every stranger accidentally make eye contact with. takes emotional energy. neutral face appear intimidating.

Yeah fair enough. I'm assuming live US, UK absolutely obligation force smile every stranger lives area less (I forget which) 70-80% vaccinated, there‚Äôs herd immunity.

Isn't point article dude already vaccinated though? seems excessive whether 5 years 5 months me, say ultimately. actively discourage people taking measures consider appropriate themselves, even makes look bit OTT personally.   According you. made great research uselessness masks preventing covid spread. We‚Äôve pandemic long now? You‚Äôd think people would figured way kids everyone gotten opportunity vaccinated yet UK.  Good. look forward world denial basic decency science deadly consequences.  Let social darwinism happen. really make sense though. ""If vaccinated remove mask."" Response going be, ""Umm, remove mask now. There's way tell I'm vaccinated not."" one stopping wearing mask want to. Yup. CDC dropped ball many times, I'm pretty sure playing soccer now. 

It's embarrassing really took long acknowledge something physicians scientists saying year. 

No wonder public trust medicine disappeared. anyone blame public supposed top PH agencies make blunders like this? Israel strict travel restrictions place, affected much. gives shit?  guess difference former loonies could end spreading disease. new loonies would hurt one. even talking about? Yes concern unvaccinated shit show basically let's anyone wear mask now, including anti vaxxers.

So again, good thing people literally time fully vaccinated put situations unvaccinated people maskless. source? vaccinated need wear mask. LOL I‚Äôm immunocompromised I‚Äôm scared mask mandates going away. getting comfortable going shopping people around without masks think I‚Äôll return ordering grocery delivery. Hopefully booster variants soon, might help anxiety little. Good luck! That‚Äôs interesting take haven‚Äôt heard before. I‚Äôm writing completely, I‚Äôm basing opinion experience last year. wear one five days week 10 hours day can‚Äôt help scratch head people say ‚Äúit‚Äôs bad‚Äù ‚Äúit isn‚Äôt big deal‚Äù. sure bug crap me. would lot easier didn‚Äôt bother me. wish case. Exactly. Parents need take precautions, stay away unvaccinated places unvaccinated might congregate, consider risks every time take kids out.

My kids exposed risk every day. Every time put kids car, risk death. Every time feed them, risk death. Every time climb things play back deck take walk around block me, risk death.

Parents gotten pretty good managing risk, think. Thank this! Lol, nope still mandates state. started badly Fauci saying ""masks help"" dumb ass thought wear one metro.  Masks slow droplet transmission well. I‚Äôm going lose sleep it. vaccine available everyone point. seems goes ones get sick die. Though people asymptomatic mild symptoms reinforces views. Even give access technology told people, ‚ÄòHere recipe,‚Äô way could train people manufacture vaccine engineers flat-out working existing partners, Holy shit, imagine they'll print find 60 seconds = 1 minute Africa  Less travel schools colleges closed though probably probably lot it. capacity restrictions  Well we're still giving nearly 2 million shots day thr US. theory cdc could've waited number shots given grinded near standstill (say 200k). point, cdc could say alright take masks, good going get. Oh alright, try read that. Thank you! dunno from, people get vaccinated also give shit store policy CDC recommendations one way other. think changes much honest, letting honest people stop wearing mask. Immunocompromised people goofy now.

Wear fucking mask indoors asshole. *Experts say they'll die.* fixed news: Fire hot! 35% never get vaccinated.

I replying false statement saying 70-85% never vaccinated issue people policing others things don‚Äôt make difference like insisting people wear masks outside shaming people going beach ones championing personal freedom. doesn‚Äôt trust pharmaceuticals, simple. clarified later. Breaking news...  CDC need address already haven't?

People either vaccinated, not. reason vaccination lack thereof immaterial whether follow guidance vaccinated non-vaccinated person. Unfortunately lot different conditions fall immunocompromised banner. example close family member condition body crap producing antibodies. vaccine, almost certainly barely effective them. take IG product monthly, something like another year least Covid antibodies make supply chain get protection way.

Soon pitch masks Get darwinized taking extra Vitamin hurts do. asthma colds. Literally may PTSD wear mask that. article even mentions it. yes, there's lot stigma around mental illness people see insult. know bunch people way. reluctantly wore masks law. They're celebrating end mask mandate despite getting vaccinated. I'm sure CDC took types people account revising guidelines. would keep kids away places potential exposure next weeks. cases continue current trend, weeks time risk diminished. 

I know Sunday, looks like yesterday lowest infections since March 2020... good sign. changes experience yes

Just like high heels thong, like another commenter said. Sure, could play every game thong, certainly comfortable I'd looking reason take Almost like different depending area! Congrats! wear mask long want. throwing mine away soon announce mandate state gone.  Kids still eligible vaccines lot countries, including US.

OP wants remain wearing masks avoid picking virus transmitting son. Edit: get virus, inhale virus exhale home? (I'm still tiny bit confused, someone thread said vaccinated people spread virus inside outside body) know covid getting positive

So know COVID. Yeah, Ireland announced today MHQ us foreseeable future. Wat [I like wearing mask hides Combine 2.1-2.4x transmissible B.1.167 popping around US... CDC worse useless entire time. Restaurants really going come back like that. Also, far many country people deserve better jobs choice 50 restaurants 5 miles. ‚Äúwish balls give authoritarianism take away people‚Äôs ability choose‚Äù logic missing, that's pretty clear. fear bringing public *chance* they're exposed someone who's vaccinated? Give break. *you're* concerned *your* children, always make sure continue wear mask public. truly worried, that's simple solution. even get fact studies consistently shown immune response COVID-19 highest children 12 tested age groups. I'm sure carry energy year flu comes around. find funny people trusted experts thus far, begin get selective they'd like believe. That's odd take; seeing got there, logically. Oh cool looks like CDC fixed NH data yesterday without including todays update! HEPA filters also cause kinds problems replaced frequently enough older systems designed around them. Restricted airflow primary reason AC units freeze up. Plus town large tourism industry, gauging immunity towns current residents could tricky. done can. certain point, live life. reckless. smoke mirrors planning around election next year. organised enough organise root brothel. Pressure immense people vaccinated. ever tried keep toddler masked distanced? super possible. actually say safe maskless unvaccinated people around (because course mask less protective others). 

To part, get kids flu shots accept remaining risk. lot unknowns covid, especially terms long term effects including MIS-C long covid symptoms like fatigue anosmia etc.. want risk kids' sense smell taste permanently wait months vaccine. Sure risk death low, risk long term effects still unknown. vaccine sight would probably deal risk better never able go back normal life. months. would've waited age groups could vaccinated lift mask mandates. makes young kids much harder, already difficult year.  'This well documented scientific literature.'

Your source? otherwise I'm writing Facebook Certified Expert Contagious Disease. Yankees get covid despite vaccinated? body choice well documented scientific literature.

Could cite sources abundant scientific literature please?

Facebook count.  don‚Äôt say.. drove 90 miles hour wrong way freeway die!  say sky blue. sun quite warm.  It‚Äôs like people 12 go grocery store. sucks kids they're eligible vaccine, kinda view kids collective whole parents point. parent's responsibility make sure kids get COVID, point continuing wear masks social distancing.

If kid parent anti-vax gets COVID parent, I'll feel bad kid entirely parent's fault getting vaccinated.   think, especially Reddit, intense desire sort karmic justice. period anti-science crowd would suffer comeuppance dragging us whole past year. idea many selfishly rolled dice 15 months, potentially infecting killing others, really suffer kind retaliation unpleasant reminder unfair world is. one likes population thanklessly save contingent beplauged ingrates. Aka care ""those"" kids can‚Äôt wait take shit off. It‚Äôs sensory hell me. America Might avoid target then. vaccines great calling effective thing far humans ever created somehow stretch also based ill-defined criteria. would thought would contradiction, somehow you‚Äôve achieved simultaneously. flight would good time parents teach kid public hygiene lessons (like coughing downward / elbow, etc), provide cloth cough cough drops/syrup old enough, literally anything mitigate spread germs. :/ anti-vaxxer, somehow vaccine danger, COVID, measles, mumps, etc. backwards. pretty common. really ironic, wearing mask getting shot different. Plenty people believe scared covid, also afraid vaccine. point pretty hard believe ""masks work"" ""it's flu"" know people died it.

Unfortunately misinformation vaccine fresh, example grandma thinks made aborted babies... still wears mask want die. frustrating I'm tired hearing antivaxers stupid theories, I'm trying provide perspective. Florida shitty? 100%. Good. 60 years ago, first rejected Wells‚Äô research going backwards beliefs ‚Äúbad air.‚Äù Wells right, get recognition deserved, nearly enough.

Check article  no...what saying this: one cares immuno compromised immuno suppresants. dismissed continuously blamed economic reasons shutdowns. told either ""stay home"" receive sort imaginary ""focused protection"" expense economy.

This isnt right vs left thing either. alot leftists agree say dont care vulnerable society. constantly dismissed reasons as:

""im young healthy""

""it affects old people""

&amp;#x200B;

They might well say, dont give fuck anyone isnt ME. realistically we‚Äôre never gonna reach heard immunity Dumb people gonna dumb. Long term health effects looking nasty even kids new strains affecting kids worse. extremely vulnerable  Correct I'm wrong, people 12 still can't get vaccine, everyone yet.   Link? Exactly. around bend finish line kids. We, family, made far. I'm tripping now! Bingo! encourage people make time read article. good. really hoping avoid 3rd wave.  announcement

The fact people keep implying *this announcement* what‚Äôs convincing people get vaccinated opposed fact never gonna get vaccinated anyway massively disingenuous. Honestly, started Asia did. I'm surprised corporate American media empires push board members' companies could save productivity money sick days Yup, mom calls tell 60 year old neighbor died heart attack day getting vaccine. response ""dang, probably Covid got vaccine, sucks""


And like ""what mean, can't covid, got vaccine!""

sigh reasoning solid could much right. 

I‚Äôm siding optimism given new triple variant ravaging India still beaten vaccines based gene sequencing performed Jan 2020. 

I‚Äôm hooooping fear new novel viruses animal groups brought new contact new variants established virus. front secondary health effects looking pretty serious new strains affecting kids worse not. trying force poor random person take defend strawman position created them. hoping someone take side try make appear side believes masks condoms head forcefield protects people ever exposed virus. one thinks one take bait. 

You're internet troll. That's think grow up. Japan's testing capacity terrible. Like 30k-60k tests day country 127m course pandemic, even report tests (I.e. take-home tests reported). early days pandemic, impossible get tested unless admitted hospital, essentially.

Their covid response general one worst world. government gave households two cloth masks basically said, ""Good luck."" 

The government waged stimulus campaign encourage domestic travel across nation bulk pandemic, ""Go Travel"" campaign.

The government media consistently blamed spread foreigners, even point saying way foreigners *speak* causes covid spread faster compared Japanese (look ""'This pen' covid"" lol). media would often blame community spread foreign variants foreign communities rather society's ineptitude anything merit.

The ""good"" thing Japan banning entry country, measure island nation allowed luck (along heavy mask compliance). even measure highly discrimantory--Japanese natives move relatively freely, vaccinated foreigners (for part) may enter Japan whatsoever.

Their vaccine rollout equally shit. Sitting 70+ million vaccines going unused right now. Less 1% population vaccinated, majority public officials healthcare workers.

IMHE estimates Japan 100k covid deaths, they've reported 10k.

And 2 months, Japan supposed host biggest sporting event decade. they've asked hundreds already overworked nurses straight *volunteer* for, government enough resources. they've already cancelled multiple legs *torch relay* dozen/hundred spectators attendance.

Japan's joke. Comparing based state level rules good metric states vary much based population density virus heavily introduced areas, weather changes too. lot variables looking weather mask wearing likely good indicator. Even though vaccinated still contract covid. unlikely require hospitalization die.

Also covid-19 living spread without getting sick.

I'm wearing mask prevent spread even though I'm vaccinated. want spread someone vaccinated. person hypothetically spread another chance mutate something vaccine might work against.

I'll stop wearing mask get 80% vaccinated. Gamers rise LOL true   Pretty disgusting. Agreed. cases deaths continue fall, feel anxiety starting ease, I‚Äôm meeting people every week without nerves, especially since know positivity rates area going day week.

That said, everyone become comfortable pace. wants continue masking longer, don‚Äôt see harm - he‚Äôs hurting anyone. thing making mask use work well fucks going family friends house hang maskless, eat, drink, whatever.

Every fucking person know got covid. Every fucking one cried wore mask - went bar. let sick family member house. saw fucking eyes called shit think magic covid fucking wall other's house eating whatever.

Bunch mouth breathers are. Apologies, suggest BSN adds? magnet? Well here's good article read: 

[But Covid‚Äôs effect children fundamentally different effect adults. children, Covid looks much like kind risk society long tolerated, without upending daily reasonable probably going happen.    someone knuckle punch arm least balanced! see doctor. Eh - think ignoring emotional benefit all.

Taiwan Singapore completely different situation since never became rampant 40% country whatever want. 

Plus - Singapore currently sits 22.8% vaccinated can't even find Taiwan's data.

It strange talking friends overseas lockdowns smaller #'s local US counties - we're different world also control vaccine mfg ourselves. Freedom choice, Japan, almost everyone wears mask flu season.

We used work Japan 1980s saw marks everywhere pre-COVID. Western countries Japan dictatorships. People righto choose. harms one protects facial recognition. fail see issue free society.

Given eradicated flu season year, make masking norm feeling well. didn‚Äôt say was. wouldn‚Äôt damn hard hold weeks basically going ‚Äúyeah, masks required anymore‚Äù, basically is. There‚Äôs reason people kids can‚Äôt get vaccinated various reasons feel forgotten overlooked.   Dear media,

No one calling ""jabs"" you.

Sincerely, Everyone else It‚Äôs already started Congress. Q people started harassing mask-wearing representatives Friday, less 24 hours CDC‚Äôs announcement. long time looked it, I'm pretty sure NYTimes risk map based criteria--so 2 criteria, either one high, that's highest risk level  astrology sign impacts vaccine side effects, 11 absolutely fucked, likely illegal. children bringing home to? Kinda feels like kids completely forgotten since able vaccinated yet. Okay? Anyone wants vaccine point get vaccine. refuse get vaccinated lying wear mask, fault get sick.  Anecdotally true me. friend mine texted blue late night asking help getting vaccinated day announced. They‚Äôd putting weeks suddenly hurry kids 12 can't get vaccine yet? know tend get severe cases, still. mask minimize chances catch cold, reduce chance infecting others sick. I'm central-ish PA.  sad see mental affect people. virus low mortality rate healthy young people.  1) Allergies

2) Common cold

3) Seasonal flu

4) Children 15 still unvaccinated

5) people anaphylactic allergies yet gotten full approval vaccinate.

6) People undergoing chemotherapy radiation therapy

There's 6 right gate, 3 completely unrelated COVID unaffected COVID vaccine. 

There's literally reason hyperbolic. get without mask want one, great, others still valid reasons ultimately affect way. draw ""my body choice"" stance? point cross endangering another human refusing vaccination, contracting virus, spreading it? Okay, diseases infectious, widespread, damaging?

You claimed long term damage proved wrong. Nothing say that? see issue act unfortunately 

An antivaxer performance try discourage others taking 

Not even true support anyone's decision continue wear masks, socially distance avoid certain types indoor activity.

I support anyone's decision argue oppose experts' new guidelines statements indicating vaccinated individuals longer need things. That's big difference here. science denier, cool me. Italy vaccination children mandatory, else they're allowed school.

If kids go school get jail, guess that's motivator. Ahh yes, start facism! 

I remember vaccine passports realm conspiracy theories. 

All boil frog increase temperature slowly. Little realize boiled alive. China allowing Taiwan government get vaccinated China well Adults supposed protect children, way around. 1. Theft may constant pandemic, doesn‚Äôt mean finding culprit reclaiming lost property hasn‚Äôt dropped. insurance that‚Äôs big deal. get back cut losses. ID security cameras capturing faces big part that.

2. Employees exempt #1  kind funny seeing dick-swinging contest turned into. ""I'm actually going continue wearing mask forever I'm fucking selfish piece shit"" Thank omniscient god public health they're immunocompromised vaccine efficacy factor indecision (which say unvaccinated, consider far healthy individual) wonder start pandemic said wear masks, knew absurd decided lie would best otherwise hospitals would ppe shortages. course led lots people losing trust needed still constantly held argument antivax/antimask people know they're talking about, best interests heart, etc, etc. 

Maybe thought people take social distancing seriously thought air? either way good! ...And children.   live Fort Worth, Texas. many people wearing masks anymore. mandatory people already pushing back whole movements Watch out, logical thinking frowned upon here. literally never confirmed case covid touch.  Wearing mask another year hardly whole life.  cold flu chance killing causing severe long term damage, knew pretty much everything relevant cold/flu? Also, wearing mask cold/flu season going forward. issue hit two weeks second dose week. I‚Äôm sure lots people still two week period need second dose still. wish would waited another couple weeks make sure everyone 100% ready go. saw plenty people wearing masks there‚Äôs way vaccinated, that‚Äôs problem people lie vaccinated. Mainly families young kids know kids aren‚Äôt fully vaccinated. is, hopefully don‚Äôt spike again. said caught guaranteed end hospital hundreds needles put 

How even remotely true wore n95 mask cloth mask top 14 months - STILL GOT SICK?

That's least bit curious ask me. vectors infection there?

Was surfaces? Frozen food, what?!! Dammit !!! That's plainly incorrect. Masks still give decent level protection people, even combined social distancing. Weird motto ""e pluribus unum"" then.

It kind implies idea greater good, guess that's interpretation too. Username checks theft bad management - employees stealing.

Theft issue pandemic worked sudden be? covid create invulnerability similar vaccine... much evidence come people read understand that? many children population died? many died infected COVID? many died passed result COVID? Seems low me, definatly high engough make Target run think children die result.    Variants appear uncontrolled spread regardless masks social distancing. don‚Äôt uncontrolled spread anymore. Case counts low - game breaking variant isn‚Äôt gonna come inside US, ever appears all.  Agreed. daughter 5. Masks stay family able vaccinated, too. think either, hope gamble pays off. home county, think will. getting vaccinated, masks coming off, plenty active cases. That's context, seems hard lot people grasp. Tbh, lot folks going maskless stores already.  oh one *those* people huh?

1. dont care fauci said didnt say.
2. literally study says this. end.

bye Absolutely fucking not. That‚Äôs probably disconnect comes threads hand wringing issue. me, it‚Äôs nothing new, there‚Äôs always good 25% people never wearing masks stores chin diaper move malicious compliance, rural go. past couple month especially I‚Äôve seen masking drop 50% average, depending store. guess live liberal area you‚Äôre probably used significantly high compliance thought mask usage going new scary thought. So, percentage dead children think acceptable don‚Äôt wear mask Target anymore?

I know flu dangerous, vaccinate it. know Covid less dangerous, still risks long term effects unclear, would really like able vaccinate child masks get thrown completely. Well course vaccine antidotal ;-) Good No. Chinese definitely handled far strictly others initial outbreak. even issues connecting flights. 'standard procedure' mentioned install new law fine heavily 'spreading fake covid news' testing. countries catching positive cases past year, hear it. someone ? S.Korea stating likely aerosols last year time testing HVAC filters. 

There's articles scientist testing air particles pollution finding covid-19 well .  ‚ÄúChances infection someone Newark impossible‚Äù. ‚ÄúWhy bother risking‚Äù 

Trust science! /s going free all.

I Costco yesterday probably 80% masked higher. fear free matching reality me, though expect regional. Whether anyone wants admit not, digital vaccine passports coming. Depends exposure time. sitting next someone who's unmasked positive 8 hours day, even n95 likely eventually get sick. 

If talking trips grocery 9ther brief exposures, n95 likely prevent getting sick.

I use p100 n95 filters, depending expect exposure be. p100 respirator, know sure viral particles inhaled, mask filters screw onto bulky hot fun wear long. I've maybe 2-3 bad allergy days entire *year* barely medication. year prior two medications full time stop postnasal drip would end causing infection. *amazing*  Antivax rhetoric wasn‚Äôt *nearly* strong  No, wearing mask endangers others makes people's business. Wearing mask doesn't. agree. Let's let science guide decisions, wear masks. Since....masks work. Long term may still bad, isn‚Äôt qualifier ‚Äúmost vulnerable‚Äù. aren‚Äôt vaccinated point probably weren‚Äôt planning getting vaccine anyways it‚Äôs time stop taking consideration. Looking find articles, seems like wait 12+ trial completed, likely end summer. expect 12 approval come end 2021. may never actually get approved age group though, Pfizer Moderna may get full approval point J&amp;J would demonstrate vaccine advantages mRNA vaccines unclear possible. mean you‚Äôll wear disease eradicated? That‚Äôs mean goal posts moving. act like there‚Äôs endpoint comfortable taking listen follow example. endpoint. it‚Äôs zero-cost thing life wear one forever. never sing group eat food festival ever again? Never make funny faces baby public, never smile neighbor, never smell weed bud tender offers me? diseases exist? Diseases treatments for? like it. mask sunglasses can't see face feel like I'm pull heist something. Sure suck wear like consider perks. ever attended school? know likely ""mandated"" get vaccines allowed in, right?

It's public health issue, viruses care ""rights,"" particularly airborne ones. Widespread vaccination primary tool species prevent running wild. specifically anti-vaxxers, happily stop masking

Can't emphasized enough. Yeah right. anti masker anti vaxxers lie. That's absolutely going help ease parent's concerns.... OP *others* wearing masks, since deleted comment replying to.

For record I‚Äôll continue wearing mask crowded indoor areas don‚Äôt find big deal every little bit counts. Nah LMFAO nobody going make me. won‚Äôt even enforce vaccine travel. covid test. course will. vaccines work well wouldnt reach Covid measles host diseases? I‚Äôve wearing masks airplanes long haul flights 2017 onwards. air dry drinking plenty water wearing mask help keep hydration comfortable. yes. agree. Plus might nice prove ""flu deaths"" ""flu cases"" werent actually counted covid-19 deaths/cases conspiracy theorists love spout off. CDC says reaching porta-potty eating handfuls people's bio-waste make sick. Local news reports sky blue Dude, come on. Could something growing reports large inflation coming  don‚Äôt think problem distrust experts here, rather distrust people distrusting experts since start. Yeah, CDC guidance says go maskless, CDC restated information saying there‚Äôs still 10% gap efficacy could allow get mild asymptotic infection - turn could pass along others. however depends much exposure (thus recommendations public transportation continued mask wearing). people live people can‚Äôt get vaccinated reduced efficacy due medication (such organ transplant patients). They‚Äôre likely gonna continue mask wearing time despite CDC guidance.

So know many people actively refusing vaccination also actively refusing mask wearing, there‚Äôs hesitancy fully embrace CDC guidance many individuals, that‚Äôs ok. hesitant take mask doesn‚Äôt cause anyone harm, hesitant wear one get vaccinated can. ""If 100% effective, 0% effective.""   TLDReddit  Nah, sadder would cause nation-wide protests. Yeah, vaccination far bigger mitigating factor wearing mask is. Especially you‚Äôre wearing mask prevent contracting it. diseases matter, consider baseline level risk. aren‚Äôt going wearing masks forever. Why? flu almost non existent 2020. 

In almost previous years killed 200 children every year US. That‚Äôs vaccines available. 

300 pediatric deaths 2020 COVID dumpster fire vaccines available.

With much 12 years population vaccinated moving forward, probably younger people also eventually approved COVID vaccines - least admit 300 figure come down?

Therefore, admit COVID flu CHILDREN, pose perhaps similar amount risk? agree. respiratory viruses don‚Äôt spread easily without symptoms Covid vaccinated person feels fine unlikely get anyone sick whether wear mask not.

I think settings requiring routine mask use makes sense post-pandemic hospitals nursing homes full extremely vulnerable people. doubtful all. legal force self-government right issue law chance win court. Well, maybe believe scientists said it‚Äôs safe vaccinated people wear masks. 

This conservative health agency. err side caution everything sunscreen alcohol cooking steaks. cloth mask buy gas station medical device. think people ‚Äúlosing shit‚Äù ‚Äúfreaking out‚Äù vaccinated aren‚Äôt concerned much others. We‚Äôve seen people lie vaccinated refuse wear masks. lot vaccinated people worried people lying everyone fully vaccinated yet eligible, everyone eligible vaccinated yet, everyone safely able vaccinated due unique health issues. I‚Äôm masks leaving it‚Äôs safe opinion enough people vaccinated yet happening soon. 1. vaccines gone years years testing assuage concerns ‚Äúlong-term effects‚Äù. Again, qualms covid vaccine somewhat sympathize people concerned.

2. Parents choose vaccinate kids always send kids private school homeschool them. What‚Äôs alternative Polish town? exist? Move another town vaccine isn‚Äôt required?

Re: viruses caring ‚Äúrights‚Äù: you‚Äôre worried covid, get vaccine. don‚Äôt want vaccine, spin roulette wheel take chances. really don‚Äôt care people getting covid they‚Äôre going take care themselves. last time protested circumcision? know people talked using masks seasonally. fail see logic getting sick normal - shows immune system working. that, don‚Äôt healthier terms fitness, healthy eating, also keep distance you‚Äôre sick make sure wash hands

I don‚Äôt think everyone thing. personally don‚Äôt want wear mask every flu season - let alone rest life. said, someone wants - means think people awhile won‚Äôt get comfortable quick trip, yes, would bring store vaccines hasn‚Äôt gotten yet illnesses rare area. Covid, hand, rare area. doomsday scenario painting. many hundreds kids died past year sending schools? many thousands hospitalized? Kids miniscule risk COVID-19 concern. drama comment.. r/whoosh ‚ÄúAlleged‚Äù spreaders? bring Covid China. I'm going harass anyone chooses keep mask, expect harass choice either. made post local FB group asking businesses allowing unmasked vaccinated customers State eased mask guidance people absolutely flipped out. Apparently following CDC guidelines makes entitled indicates care vulnerable. read New England Journal Medicine article morning contained study concluding people eat much risk obesity. gross. Nobody gives shit kids use end. Let's admit kids least considered this. threw front screens said ""deal it."" I‚Äôm expert, seeing effects lock downs years come kids. sad. use analogy: 

Everything mitigate risks driving child something *you* do. telling people something. 

So would like decreasing local speed limits 15MPH one ever dies accident child car. 

However, point accept certain amount risk driving. It‚Äôs ‚Äúpretty‚Äù dangerous things considered time, societally.

So there‚Äôs something I‚Äôm ‚Äúsupposed‚Äù worry about, don‚Äôt worry unless it‚Äôs risky driving. nursing scarf? always used one cover stores people prone get close. walking, take peeks interact, get quickly  Everyone forced wear masks though.... read exactly we‚Äôre talking about, you‚Äôll see got point at. look incredibly ignorant stupid right now. Keep replying lol areas us car legally required pass emissions tests. Eating balanced diet won‚Äôt kill neighbor. guess it‚Äôs data dump. NH normally report daily? strange Sorry list suggested J&amp;J due fact it‚Äôs 1 done compared Pfizer gotta 2 (possibly 3 future) 

They argued expensive get, even though offered pay difference pocket 

It‚Äôs making nonsense excuses point wear mask home child? plurality people know that. Also still spread virus vaccine. vaccine reduce effects nasty infection virus. mask mandates lifted months many states rise cases. time.  made aware school ventilations  agree sentiment, think mutation come due insane things places like India control, domestic policy can't change said child vaccinated yet. 

So already safe Covid? Yeah still get 45% better 0% also reduces severity flu get sick.   lot people think CDC creates policies control mandates. guess people used independent scientific organization become politicized.

Their job tell us science give us truth. give guidance diseases, continued say vaccinated people mask despite evidence, would anyone believe anymore? kids can‚Äôt vaccinated yet?   So... try say?

That antivax people wont get sick anymore? enough vacinated wont problem? 

What point try make? I'll counter point. disagree, albeit may right. 

The CDC organization driven providing guidance based health science. never aligned policymaking trying play economy individual psychology. reason assume here, especially since said yesterday solely using data. 

They said vaccinated people drop masks everywhere, literally, can. individual risk over. Now, mean immediately drop restrictions? job talk it. Thus pass baton public policy advisors decide they'll issue corresponding changes regulations. buck stops. feel like, going upset mandates lifting, upset businesses cities, CDC. literally messenger scientific data. would disservice organization know proof vaccinated people safe withhold reporting.  So, percentage dead children think acceptable swimming pool backyard? don‚Äôt know definitively yet. reasonable parent feel concerned unsafe taking children indoors given fact unvaccinated people running around without masks. Hospitalizations children increasing. guidance neglectful young children can‚Äôt vaccinated yet. Good news! Masks apparently exceptionally effective preventing spread flu well!    Yeah variants thing develop affect us cause AMURICA... make argument sort law government regulation, though.

Personally, don‚Äôt think caregiver old sick people able skip COVID vaccine.

I really don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs much ask for. grandparents get vaccinated? likely - percentage 65+ vaccinated high nationwide. Would bring store without covid around? Why/why not? Assuming young MMR vaccines etc. Oh everyone understands that. understand that. cdc understands that. seem think you‚Äôre person understands it. We‚Äôre realistic it. unvaccinated lie. SHOCKER! Thank god sleuths like exist keep us line. MASSACHUSETTS FULL GO MAY 29th!!  feel like soon. alarmist? see wearing crowded indoor spaces, planes trains etc become common place. Personally I‚Äôd like see restaurants make mandatory people preparing/serving food. one double take title? think it‚Äôs normal cautious want wait scientific method show something safe effective. hope don‚Äôt mind share knowledge shared friends concerns.

I‚Äôm 20s. 1 10,000 25 year old adults get COVID die. That‚Äôs pretty low odds, right?

So might think, get vaccine? I‚Äôm young, really need it? much risk? Well odds getting common serious complication aside allergic reaction, blood clot, vaccines even *lower* that. women got blood clots J&amp;J. Even you‚Äôre woman get Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine, odds getting blood clot less 1 250,000. that‚Äôs authorized vaccine issues. Pfizer Moderna even safer. 

Circling back, you‚Äôre adult, odds dying COVID unvaccinated *higher* odds serious complication choose get vaccine. applies matter age group biological sex.

This emergency mandate also means point we‚Äôve administered vaccine tens millions adults. That‚Äôs larger sample size you‚Äôd see clinical trial several orders magnitude. We‚Äôve seen it‚Äôs safe.

What we‚Äôre still ironing efficacy, meaning well vaccine prevent COVID. results measurement change based *when* measure. measure cases low nationwide, efficacy look better measure cases peak.

We‚Äôve got great data Pfizer Israel, exclusively vaccinated population Pfizer. fully vaccinated 56% percent total population 60% least one Pfizer shot. first week April, new cases dropped whopping 60%! new positive COVID cases look like now. 
Deaths dropped orders magnitude see They‚Äôre country 9 million they‚Äôre averaging 38 new cases per day. January peaked 9700! started vaccination campaign December, see effects vaccination looking numbers. mid January, 1 5 Israelis received first dose. Look graph new cases, see cases drop precipitously following weeks received doses. Suggest checking comment history see issue

Did ask J&amp;J claimed it‚Äôs expensive Yeah, UVC (or ""Far Field UV"") great technology serious limitations. Air ductwork moves pretty rapidly, ballpark 150 cubic feet per minute medium pressure ductwork (like main supply ducts generic office building). Far Field UV (UVC) requires around minute direct exposure deactivate pathogens. air moving way fast provide meaningful benefit.

Using UVC direct exposure, say overhead lighting office environment, problematic definition UVC penetrate much (Which used human applications, want cancer!) even thinist film dust stop it. underside keyboard, power cables, bottom mouse, etc. going clean space thoroughly enough UVC implementation might well use sanitizing cleaners first place avoid expense.

Finally, human exposure problem, regions require door lockdowns UV release, hazard lights, etc. pretty big infrastructure cost include prevent accidental irradiation.

Where make sense building core air handlers, cooling coils, evaporation pans, filters, etc. actually help mitigate growth bacteria filters decrease pressure created higher-rated filter media core building HVAC systems.

Finally worth pointing out, UVC really studied laboratory settings, efficacy real world still unproved peer reviewed analysis.   Best luck you. biggest thing me. frustrating bit good news met criticism people acting like ""mask"" side losing. I've mask wearer. subscribed /r/masks4all early pandemic bought high-quality KF-94 KN95 masks throughout past year. wear everywhere out. 

But I'm still happy news I'm going suddenly act like know CDC respect public health. me, clear indicator vaccines best way fight COVID. People wear masks non-complicit ""mask wearing"" basically count mask wearing anyway. different people wearing masks wrongly/as technicality say walking past host table. Okay, blood clots pfizer moderna vaccine. two vaccines reported still 1 million. agree majority said wearing mask prevent social life cause depression?? *crickets*  Children 2 wear masks all. OP said Abbott corrupt governor country. comment retorted bringing Cuomo. That's how. point vaccines approved younger kids, don‚Äôt access level safety everyone else Covid. CAN, however, things increase safety driving. Isnt China‚Äôs vaccine effective? countries used seen outbreaks whereas countries like US, Israel, U.K. Vaccines flu work like 45% time though CDC fucked up. Everyone knows doesn‚Äôt want say anything tired wearing masks staying home living skin. 

This declaration reckless dangerous everyone hasn‚Äôt vaccinated. It‚Äôs going get people killed. one refute this. told us masks protect others fuck protect yourself....   article literally says already vaxing troops since march. likely surplus doses. *Looks around humanity*...yeh, people definitely going harassed still. Ahh there's homophobia. agree, CDC business psychological manipulation. said good information, states make good use information. public health coworkers epidemiologists like Dr. Osterholm disagree you. Please stay lane. Even though know it‚Äôs sarcasm know stupid it‚Äôd hope sort change hurts  Right, people cities. Less 300 deaths 30 million cases kids 18. people‚Äôs go don‚Äôt want think. sudden everyone invokes word science. Unfortunately word become relevant people sick hearing it. 

Question. drive car? Science says polluting earth that. follow science stop driving. That‚Äôs fair point. think understand ""don't to"" means.   That‚Äôs treat stoplights. I'm super concerned kids get sick die (though even asymptomatic people showing concerning organ failures months later), I'm concerned becoming vectors spreading, especially school classmates eldery live-in grandparents may vaccinated.  know situation can't judge. offer sister's experience. 60 frail, multitude health problems. severe shellfish allergy. doctor frightened getting vaccine except hospital setting, made effort help happen. Months went by. daughter talked going getting vaccine anyway, stayed her. monitored carefully fine. got J J.

Like said, know situation, cases safe. mean CDC putting vulnerable risk order save risk? Clear mud. don‚Äôt think someone right go wherever would like without vaccinated, like going concerts college. isn‚Äôt one fundamental rights bodily autonomy? Howso? agree necessary, mandates relaxed, masks still convey multitude benefits people feel make worthwhile personal level. Yeah, sure, upvoted you. realize NJ datacenter hub. know warehouse hub. wonder also anything it. Illinois finally dropped mask mandate fully vaccinated people. üòé I'm actually livid. along follows CDC NY time remove mask mandates he's digging heels. joke. vote literally anybody else. They've got gait recognition unfortunately I'm sure they'll move face recognition goal posts 95 whatever percent accuracy needed make match 70 something.  Sorry dude. That‚Äôs fair teachers, f...ed Well control situation India? comes going unvaccinated spread amongst lying wearing masks. *Constantly wearing cloth masks worse constantly wearing medical mask time cloth occasionally

There fixed comment since misleading rule thumb I'm wearing mask workers need wear masks. last month? March? February? knew vaccinated population threat others way back then. long justify restricting lives people dutifully waited become vaccinated?  government implementing mandatory quarantine either.So they're trying undertest keep low case count actually anything.

Mandatory quarantine implemented since early epicenter days Wuhan. can't make stuff fit narrative. write comment twice? wtf Why?

Seriously, really find huge difference masked unmasked, even preferred mask winter keep nose warm. mask, he's literally nothing different, reducing anxiety covid, possibly even improving mental state. Also, lungs vulnerable post covid, may good idea mask body heals we're see normal illnesses return higher numbers social distancing stops.

I know big deal people choosing wear masks is. literally effect anybody else, unlike antimaskers choosing wear mask periods high spread, claimed needed leave alone ""personal freedoms"". people getting vocal people wearing masks. people may actually need therapy becoming clear cannot handle masks symbol illness intolerant reason. Thanks!

For first study seems issues. less 2 percent 65+ years old, median age 38 (so, half younger that). part that, symptomatic cases, means confidence level large range. even points young age might different studies. 

For second study, agree, that's line, though still high end, studies. surprised real number something around 70%, maybe small amount lower, given studies it. 

Again, thanks cites! studies CDC announcement website.  submission automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Thank helping us keep information /r/Coronavirus reliable!


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* We'd saving fist fight robots thimbles full water older.  Correct decision. unvaccinated people wanna lie takeoff mask, risk them. deaths last 7 days tell whole story? Get fucking grip. cdc's biggest mistake. continously messed messaging throughout pandemic initial risk, mask usage beginning this.

Their statements always technically correct realized majority care nuances. think people underestimate role apathy, especially rural areas less devastating. people know know anyone died it, less motivated. Nope, people posting ridiculous theories online, shit-stirring Twitter YouTube account posted ""not even trying look official"" meme. numbers, cannot assume 30% mutually exclusive number. Plenty 30% could also got vaccinated, counting twice. 

I'm saying add 30% 50%. assuming 30% 50% unvaccinated previously infected, add 15% 50% get 65%. We're lot closer herd immunity think. think dumb without large scale way confirm people wearing masks vaccinated fully. Honor system seems weak political people realizing political decisions made.

TRusT ScIEncE!!!!

Some hard information Washington state:
Daily new infections May 2020 caused lockdowns (7 day average)- new infections Washington State 2021 lift mask mandate (because totally beat Covid guys!):
7 day average - 1,232.

Deaths 2020 time, 7 day average: 9 2021 7 day average: REALITY shows WORSE went lockdowns.

But CDC says we're good now. need worry all.

So never reason worry begin with?

Or government CDC politicizing get society want (gotta improve job numbers y'all)?

And realizing now, imagine others feeling regards crap that's politicized this, wonder people hesitant get vaccine, sooooooo many decisions coming CDC political nature. I'm not. Dude posts day. He's every thread. I'm suggesting take break. Go outside. good focus this. getting upset maybe also take break. way kids asthma? waiting they'd approved vaccine? thought conversation context vaccinated person. Obviously virulent strain ravage unvaccinated. person replied clearly stated ""in vaccinated"". Certainly deaths hospitalized vaccines 100% effective. far CDC tracked something like 130 deaths fully vaccinated. failing see would tens thousands without serious immune escape. It‚Äôs easy. Click phrase ‚ÄúNew Deaths.‚Äù

Florida new deaths every state.

Florida largest state, it?  wife gotten pretty crazy bills got married. Recently needed therapy pocket cost crazy, even insurance. Kids need supervised. Sometimes need bring kids buy groceries. dumbass decision CDC puts kids risks. Assuming assholes railing masks vaccines spreading disease going grow something protect others (wear masks vaccinated) beyond naive, negligent.  much quell fears cameras Target checkouts. Target long leader tracking customers, point able predict pregnant woman's due date, even know pregnant family. theory use cash multiple credit cards hurts ability track customer's purchases using facial recognition bridge gap. facial recognition work well masks on. mitigations COVID bringing hospitals knees causing mass deaths. 

We mandate masks initiate lockdowns sniffles. Vaccination reduced COVID non-threatening infection, individually public health scale. Quite true, certainly need sort reasoned metric produced epidemiologist, general downward trend sufficient own, lest invite new rebound. seems like CDC's position ""If vaccinated, need mask anymore!"" meant hopeful incentive get vaccinated, rather policy based metric. true irrelevant fact save lives, could reimplement order save lives. unlikely. vaccine 100% effective, yes, cells amazing things cell epitopes strongly conserved across variants. reason think virus get creative diminishing population unvaccinated people.

IF run proudly unmasked/antivax person, wish quick painless covid way. really impossible compare people selling ""low death rate kids"" ignoring fact mask mandates distance learning place much country, including populous states, since started. Schools state require masks distancing children bubbles class.

Also, guarantee 95% effective vaccine available seasonal flu simple measure could used stop transmission (like wearing mask), people mind using measure month two prevent tens thousands Americans dying. masks politicized huge burden ask people wear grocery store gas station kids might around. Protection goes ways:  Simpler how? now? Also know? Saying June July arbitrary now. state release thresholds meet before? What‚Äôs matter? angry you‚Äôre getting enough handouts? realize Newsom consults experts million different things reaches decisions, right? June 15 picked ago, gather chosen give enough time everybody receive doses vaccine + two weeks full protection.  forge signature. It‚Äôs good. government implementing mandatory quarantine either. 

So they're trying undertest keep low case count actually anything. Sprouts, Oklahoma, least. show data says children spread Covid rate vaccinated adults?

Just lower spread rate pandemic full force vaccine, doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre somehow magically par vaccinated adults now.

According CDC, less 10 percent Covid cases children 5-17. That‚Äôs insignificant number size demographic.

Nothing kids continuing wear masks argument permanent masks everyone. That‚Äôs ridiculous. There‚Äôs clear end date kids, get vaccinated. Like come on‚Ä¶

You‚Äôre also ignoring adults *can‚Äôt* get vaccinated. get COVID dick sticks around. flu someone willing outdoors mask. Still pending indoors goes live locally. see mean, think means population figure used input Barnett formula, makes sense. There's loads varying population estimates country hence need specify used. Absolutely effectively pointless vaccinated population. live much urban area Arizona, population density nothing enforcement. months half customers store coming without masks since nobody store anything DAMN KID, TAKE FREE FOOD! Hahaha. totally think serious, think others saying hopes getting reassurance. Today first day work sans mask said something couple coworkers felt weird. Knowing one felt way made feel little confident going without one. Trusting science way negates validity individual choice wear masks. population level, vaccine incredible success. Even so, individual level risk getting sick remains nonzero (even odds death close zero). perfectly reasonable individuals continue choosing wear masks mitigate risk concern reason. Honestly fine. wouldn‚Äôt mind waiting another month mask mandate lifted (NJ), long there‚Äôs proper timeline/date given it‚Äôs gonna happen. People want something look forward Sounds reasonable IMO. Post text. Colorado here, indoors/in businesses stores see mask wearers part, wearing masks, anywhere outside tho free game. 
Was portland or. month ago exact opposite, werent wearing mask times, outdoors in, someone say something youll get mean mugs constantly. partner pain gain state live section website regarding pandemic restrictions!?!? Lowes Lurking bushes rubber mask way get quality medical care. mean... Unless I'm mistaken... 9 months ago, mRNA based technology tested humans successfully. Neither novel proteins mRNA based vaccines telling bodies make.

The FDA even approved anything emergency use.

Being forced take part experimental medical trials something international law specifically prevents.

I'm people willingly analyzing risks participating, I'm willing support forcible participation new technologies better longer.

Let's compare apples oranges, please. hey, mind still shine brightly :) Absolutely not! It‚Äôs knowing anti vaxx morons follow guidance put mask stop spread people get vaccine like kids. Surprised it‚Äôs half . We've masked year, wear mask 4 weeks means clear cut return normal. people say Americans vain think center world want US hand vaccines whole world.  facetious, we're anti-social species, we're great over-crowding, either. \*laughs California\* Estimates numbers, cannot assume 30% mutually exclusive number. Plenty 30% could also got vaccinated, counting twice. Again, know break cause patient privacy laws. We're trying avoid another surge cases, plan worse, working towards herd immunity.  


Relaxing indoor mask mandates vaccinated unable enforce masks unvaccinated problem want cause another surge, matter small is, still works timeline overcome virus. suspect case Murphy genuinely shell shocked worried covid. Cause definitely won‚Äôt popular move delay reopening think genuinely scared prospect loosening restrictions cases going again. weird way we‚Äôll don‚Äôt agree would probably set end date maybe end May middle June weirdly respect seem putting think best politically expedient rare. aren‚Äôt unvaccinated can‚Äôt vaccinated do! Yeah guy issues needs deal therapy--it nothing COVID really frustrating bad many systems work out. main services get appointments simply work many docs simply get many jabs others do. Everyone handling differently. know many young people managed get vaccine others, especially people prior health problems waiting months.

I'm annoyed people, said never get vaccinated, people, care restrictions met people summer, run docs vaccines, want meet many people possible asap.

But realized ""wait, that's perfect, vaccinate careless people faster, neutralize biggest superspreaders first"" Yeah, cause pile-up, spend billions dollars PR wars fight idea actually won, everyone else got number laps wrong. I'm concerned weird looks, shit like scares  Good them. mandates people choose wear whatever want face.  People sub seem understand this. see nearly 54% population unvaccinated shrug. Sure, kids we're still going end 30-40% unvaccinated said done. reach herd immunity everyone either vaccinated *or infected*. getting anti-mask churches open reach herd immunity faster. assume CDC also taken account fact U.S. homogenous w.r.t. vaccine uptake population density; so, mean regional hot-spots like NYC last April show magnitude. show 20 studies show exact opposite effectiveness mask use. CDC also told us use masks last year. changed minds times woman getting dressed date trust anything say? #1 never said methane molecules size virus please attempt put words mouth.

to fully vaccinated wearing mask I'd like say : need protected wear fine, understand. go ahead. problem all. thanks right thing get vaccinated protect us Everything county. what‚Äôs point? people vaccinated, far less people transmit it. Masks never 100% barrier anyway. best add percentage points protection.Ôøº

Even strict mask mandates last year half, still ended many cases had. It‚Äôs clear masks game changer.

But vaccines are. 200 million given already.Ôøº take vaccine still scared? much work. I'll keep mask on. CDC says mask. State, MD, says mask***. County says mask policy place indoor activities like shopping, large gatherings require masks masks area says required, even outdoors. That's completely false CDC well many organizations concrete data effectiveness masks, they're extremely effective reducing transmission. Upwards 50%. companies don‚Äôt care lol.

California actually 17th density. NJ 1st 5 times population density California. honor stuff speak of? I've heard fantasy books something see real world. flu, vaccination uptake usually low

Eh, usually around 50% get vaccinated. low. people make risk assessment happy mask less vaccine free.  Lowes give fuck dude. started last year gave $2 increase hazard pay (doesnt turn $3 hour overtime). resulted people scared virus taking time hustlers wanted money busting working like 60 hours week (my coworker fucking wanted blow brains wanted paper). Pretty sure Lowes like hike payroll people working alot (they handed hours like candy Halloween cuz people took time off).

The fucking irony stopped hazard pay right required employees wear masks. lemme get straight: hazardous enough hazard pay hazardous us required wear masks? Yea that's definitely corporate greed trust. honestly feel made mistake Bill Gates face it, person worst would George Soros far right.. seemed put lot people don‚Äôt know Bill didn‚Äôt use someone else overall appeal across political lines messenger That's almost Onion News worthy. parts US vaccines mandatory use government provided benefits, public schooling, using example, could restrict access government benefits mandate it. didn‚Äôt hold guns heads, holding guns heads isn‚Äôt reality. idea restricting government benefits (not benefits provided governments welfare) past helped reduce deadly diseases nearly 100% within US. 
Don‚Äôt fear monger. 1 week second Moderna shot I'm still lot moments really low energy/ fatigue. Anyone else expierience this? People need quit comparing flu. Americans die covid 1 year WW2. jfc. ‚ÄúThe CDC says made decision based science vaccines effective cite low number breakthrough cases.‚Äù 

This absolutely correct, *includes* J&amp;J vaccine. CDC *any* concerns J&amp;J regards unmasking, would‚Äôve said so. 

Don‚Äôt get hung efficacy numbers ‚Äî true test vaccines whether prevent serious illness, hospitalizations, deaths. J&amp;J vaccine, like Pfizer Moderna, flying colors. fact seven eight Yankees breakthrough cases asymptomatic (and eighth mild symptoms cleared couple days) proves this.

And CDC isn‚Äôt even monitoring reporting breakthrough cases anymore unless result hospitalizations deaths. CDC isn‚Äôt drastically concerned breakthrough cases, shouldn‚Äôt either.

The J&amp;J vaccine isn‚Äôt second-rate. needs shouted rooftops. It‚Äôs *incredibly* effective true job, ensure people technically catch Covid don‚Äôt get sick it. people don‚Äôt get sick Covid, ceases relevant, even technically still exists. 

So, words... please don‚Äôt worry. safe protected. gem person, bragging going get vaccine lie everyone wear mask, thanks proving point direction subreddit ... I've mask flu season since disabled mother moved 4 years ago. businesses completely cool it. 

The example mention- banks- much problem either. Usually ask step front security cameras pull aside briefly.  stupid decision . 69 year old mother can't get vaccinated can't book appointment soon she'll fight spots everyone else priority . would ready overnight? Modern day sooth sayer!  I'm still holding getting vaccinated. also excited show face world. asked I'll say I'm vaccinated carry business. Yeah, Murphy dropping ball hard. Starbucks also opening locations full indoor seating. It‚Äôs also requiring masks vaccinated people... can‚Äôt check. corporate workers working home October. Companies continuing show employees don‚Äôt care slightest. (To one‚Äôs surprise). individual incentive individual get vaccine

That's true all. family vaccinated visit without risking lives/health. I'm vaccinated go grocery stores instead everything delivered curb side pickup. I'm vaccinated travel meet vaccinated friends homes without masks.  

Maybe people following guidelines recommendations see much personal benefit vaccinated difference night day family friends. Wearing masks public weeks meant anything us. walk local grocery store get stared like I'm alien I'm one masked up. Walmart similar stores next town maybe 25% masked even height all. Fun fact I‚Äôm extra movie left /s part. cloth masks control group used cloth masks asked.....

So none control arm ever used cloth asked ones also answer cloth group?

Also realize point saying medical masks work better cloth. means actually measure masks reducing infections, therefore working, even know kinds even better others (which already know). actually arguing masks dont work trying prove using research showing masks work. certainly areas/communities low vaccination rates could see outbreaks.

At point communities going fault happens. Oh well. feel bad people can't get vaccinated, refuse Please, add discussion!!! saw articles stated can‚Äôt know it‚Äôs seasonal, think mutating strains staying around possible (I don‚Äôt relate ‚Äúseasonal‚Äù thing I‚Äôm also scientist).

Yes  plan 12 currently September (for like 0-2 set, believe.) Well much lower 70% kept raising slowly till said 70% said something else purposefully lied us Survival fittest. 

On bright side antivaxing boomers die covid spikes due laxer measures.  fuckin' hell get people wear masks.

We're adults, children; really, even children would understand one easily. vaccinated much it: simply take mask off. severe symptoms it‚Äôs continuing spread disease rather working towards fully eradicating it. 

Immediate eradication pipe dream certainly happening year, even children getting vaccinated. lol already are. Canelo‚Äôs last fight 73,000 people attendance Keep mind people rural areas skewing numbers. probably vaccinated, lot people cities are. really important thing. People crowded places getting vaccinated. Yeah agreed. got used 300-500 case drops week week 100 feels disappointing even though shouldn‚Äôt haha. Well Florida‚Äôs case they‚Äôve highest amount new daily cases 26 straight days now, depends live. Can‚Äôt spread: implies possibility spread, although extremely unlikely. 

Impossible spread: IMPOSSIBLE SPREAD. 

We still learning: understanding, although situation always changing. keep open mind open new information.

We don‚Äôt know: FUCKING CLUE


Dense? put words people‚Äôs mouths consider interpretation gospel. It‚Äôs impossible argue people like you‚Äôre absolutely correct matter scenario. refuse think critically break meaning words. want me? Would engaging name calling make feel better? helps avoid getting cold flu, doesn‚Äôt hurt. We‚Äôve gotten use wearing it. wear mask. support science shows thst vaccine effective variants. link sources getting numbers from? think may misinterpreting hard tell without context.  Great news! little evidence point mask mandate needed national level. Sure, local areas spike state health dept feel need, enact local level. mask wars favor masks. Stores still mask ‚Äúgreeters‚Äù peer pressure strong. TBD Youth good thing comes COVID-19 blood clots. Let‚Äôs talk risk factors. risk factors blood clot sin someone COVID 1) advanced age, 2) obesity, 3) underlying cardiovascular disease, 4) elevated d-dimers (a biomarker reflecting inflammatory state). Yes, agree early pandemic, really high rates blood clots China described‚ÄîDVTs high 30-40% described, 20% PEs described. know numbers may overestimated. know outpatient setting, 1 100 people would develop blood clot. COVID probably increases risk getting blood clot outpatient side probably five-fold.

Secondly, sick enough COVID hospitalized, risk increases 5-6% hospitalized. That‚Äôs really high. really sick ICU, numbers high 25-30% described. yes, risk blood clots hospitalized COVID patients extremely high. It‚Äôs negligible, though, outpatient. Even hospitalization, risk getting blood clot high 3%.

The main thing watch signs symptoms blood clots. discussion provider. Check WorldTHrombosisDay.org resources know signs symptoms DVT, PE, stroke, others. It‚Äôs important discuss provider.The last thing consider d-dimer. worry elevated d-dimer COVID patients. significantly increases risk. Providers often routinely, it‚Äôs important ask signs, symptoms, risk factors. would encourage patients ask provider d-dimer test symptoms resolving. J&amp;J cuts deliveries even 100% would anyone notice? France example get barely 500k J&amp;J doses June. 500-600k injections every day.   take mask off, assuming fully vaccinated. really much it. flu, even vaccine, dangerous kids Covid without vaccine Well sure beats eating cow manure stop people pass to?

Those people vaccinated, argument hold water anymore. Indeed, that's problem, patchwork different policies different stores.

I go Lowes work get stuff. require masks not? seen anything either way. unless there's statement put afternoon, I'll assume require wear mine.

And smaller stores PR department big chains do, policy changes even known walk store observe what's going on. I'm epidemiologist, molecular biologist. understanding something neighborhood ""This coronavirus more.""

Me either, I've found information like hard come specifically regards COVID-19. ""OMG triple mutants!"" b) order drive clicks, press always indicates might evade vaccination/previous immunity.

To steal another quote, time Bill Maher, ""if bleeds leads."" trying get dying pilot help mid flight‚Ä¶ Close finish line kids 12 older.

There many months younger kids. I'm even totally sure they'll able get year. spent huge fraction lives varying severity isolation depending family, none choice matter.

Taking Target finding clothes actually fit something without, absolutely. losing social development. avenues life, parents still hard decisions.  Please. ‚ÄúTrust science‚Äù. don‚Äôt know ‚Äúthe science‚Äù anymore! 

Cornavirus virus! submicroscopic infectious agent we‚Äôve dealing thousands years. took CDC month lockdown declare masks necessary personal protection! Viruses spread many ways. wait time guidance beyond me. initial declaration extreme protection followed easing said protection science warranted it. Instead, CDC let people die sat hands.  Yay!! dead Americans. amount vaccination thats really possibility anymore. data shows vaccinated people something like 1 1 million chance dying COVID (not even accounting age co-morbidity). Personally, I‚Äôm afraid people lying vaccine status, exposed someone covid positive vaccinated completely fine. convinced data personal experience masks redundant you‚Äôre vaccinated. Plus, average person doesn‚Äôt wear damn thing right anyway. you‚Äôre adult choose get vaccine, wear mask, take precautions despite know now, whatever happens you.

Edit: Too** Failing acknowledge people die falls time also pretty disgusting. deaths matter caused COVID? - March 2020 Going closed reduced capacity fully open overnight process know think anything physically mentally prepare reopening. hmm good point. dashboard. 559 cases announced today verse 673 last week. Keep mind dashboard releases data day before. look hraph data released today announced Murphy actually day mistakenly thought gone 100 cases cause comparing cases today‚Äôs announcement data announced 6 days ago. also think mask-wearing became symbol moral superiority. mask-wearers better unmasked idiots therefore, taking masks means longer get feel high better person. racial prejudgement comment = racism

disclaimer: 'brown' Salk Institute study showed spike protein causes endothelial damage. Would useful prevention blood clots use angioprotectors( nitric oxide, pentoxiphyllin)? think dependent area store. rural places, let's real. one enforcing face-mask policies. circumstances wear mask will, soon longer mandatory I'll maskless. They're nightmare people wear glasses, especially winter. long complying law, people free make decision whether want wear mask free judgement people.  can‚Äôt choose reopen little later? one forcing open change right second. guess we‚Äôll assume CDC took account listen science Reminder testing shit last March. It‚Äôs probably longer since case numbers like Lifetime longer requires masks. hate burst bubble literally nobody gives shit vaccine card. even know mine is; 2 months I've yet someone ask it. 

Stores going ask produce card. Imagine fuckery tried card people? remember walking around Beijing business trip years ago, seeing people masked due air pollution, especially children. overwhelming thought ""who fuck wants live like this?"" get people situations perspectives, drastic choice make absence specific high threat condition. Show peer reviewed studies show, reasonable level accuracy, actual likelihood transmission vaccinated non-vaccinated person, accounting fact overwhelming majority breakthrough cases know asymptomatic, implies we're likely missing ton breakthrough cases.

What's that? studies exist? Oh, huh, think CDC would waited studies adjusting recommendation given masks protecting people rather yourself. Everyone seems forgotten little detail lately mind boggling watch.

I'm medical expert myself, know quite industry I'm in. single one behind decision. clearly politically driven based science, order based science, _the science would need happened first_. right anecdotal evidence, would significantly comforting suggest idea many breakthrough cases actually been.

Furthermore, there's zero way ensuring someone vaccinated. entirely based honor system. well worked ""mask exempt individuals"" refuse show proof demand access store anyway?

The anecdotal evidence definitely supports effectiveness vaccines vaccinated individual. problem that, again, masks protecting others. would think twice bringing unvaccinated child somewhere requiring masks? Yeah, would, either paying attention qualified making decisions. Businesses closed open reduced capacity/with Covid restrictions need stock, clean, hire, reorganize etc. fully reopen full capacity. Especially live event venues, can't spin business back overnight one weekend, need reschedule/rehire people too. Factor II mutation, nephew died PE father, brother, F2 also almost died bilateral PEs DVTs. standard care me? flu vaccine available kids. absolutely agree you! seeing free posts FB people crowded bars already. Crazy. stores enforce this? people show proof vaccination? CDC knows this. They're idiots. people masking harm less think. matter grocery store filling house parties maskless every weekend. get car accident heart attack need ICU care it‚Äôs full Covid cases becomes problem. Said going say. I‚Äôll gladly take downvotes criticizing American healthcare system.

Luckily I‚Äôm Union, result great insurance, see others going through. We‚Äôre richest country planet, better. Yes, are. lot governors tied mandates CDC guidance backed corner US aren‚Äôt. mandatory vaccinations.

There may number things off-limits you‚Äôre vaccinated, direction go COVID vaccines, that‚Äôs mandatory vaccinations.  Kids risk virus otherwise healthy. That‚Äôs untrue... vaxxed people simply recognize antivaxxers cannot trusted vaxxed people going maskless makes harder identify antivaxxers order avoid exclude them. us feel makes sense put mandatory vaxxing passports place making impossible identify problem people. However, doesn‚Äôt mean blame vaxxed wanting maskless... hell year us actually part us done. need support work together antivax covidiots responsible last year bad. say lifted it, instead lifted vaccinated people?

There way going check people see vaccinated. makes sense say vaccinated people enforce it. vaccinated nursing, studies showing covid antibodies passing infant breast milk. might bit protection built think. directly dictate actions, maybe it'll make feel comfortable situations internally freaking out. curfew 10pm meant businesses shut earlier 9pm (here Spain quite common businesses open late).

This meant even crowded it'd normally be.

At least relaxed - requirement wear facemask whenever outdoors (even alone woods..) basically back normal. know, like 90% population vaccinated.

Situation different step outside major western economies, select small countries/city states, countries accepted Chinese vaccines. Ok
Good. 
Moving important news Ok, fit immunocompromised category able live life fairly normally. feel like go back lockdown. supposed do? Man, would loved see world improved July 4th Biden 4th July longer known American holiday, day world declared one voice: ""We go quietly night! 
We vanish without fight! 
We're going live on! 
We're going survive!"" 
Today, celebrate Independence Day! That‚Äôs great question. COVID-19 thrombosis fast-moving thing. two exciting ‚Äì probably three ‚Äì results talk about. first exciting result published largest study months ago involving predictors COVID thrombosis hospital. found confirmed findings China -t hat elevated levels D-dimers (a blood test), especially 4x upper limit normal, found it‚Äôs strong independent predictor thrombosis mortality. 
The second important finding recently published largest study post-discharge thrombotic study (5,000+ patients), found rates thrombosis all-cause mortality much higher thought. rates venous arterial thrombosis 3% rates mortality 4% range, overall outcome mortality 7% post-discharge. That‚Äôs huge ‚Äì hesitation whether real phenomenon. found much higher rate thrombosis mortality, importantly, use post-discharge anticoagulants reduced 46%. That‚Äôs major finding. Judicious use low-dose blood thinners able reduce major thrombosis, also death, almost 50%. 
  
The third study one closed called HEPCOVID. It‚Äôs in-patient study used d-dimers identify high-risk patients. We‚Äôve found rates thrombosis deaths 30% among trial participants. So, population, least 1 3 patients major thromboembolic event and/or died. Stay tuned final results four weeks. That‚Äôd fine stayed that. virus continues transmit unvaccinated people, mutates. say goodbye COVID-19 say hello COVID-21 we‚Äôre backs waiting new vaccine world shuts again.  That‚Äôs problem Yes are. Covid deniers Covid panickers become irrationally extreme. That‚Äôs consider trusting experts. Maybe faith people do. people see mask required, it‚Äôs going matter vaccinated not. people getting first dose saying I‚Äôm good! It‚Äôs ‚Äúnever return normal‚Äù attitude, it‚Äôs ‚Äúbetter safe sorry‚Äù attitude. Maybe I‚Äôm worrying, would hate see worse variants pop people continuing transmit virus, it‚Äôs easy to.  think one issue giving date anyone refusing vaccine unsure would wait anyways it‚Äôs clear messaging carrot fence. work? time tell Im optimistic think news effectively drops seating requirement. hope. prepare? Honestly asking forget buisness shit go back making face covering illegal policy wear employee cause scares customers. wear refuse take off. Otherwise thell illegal again. Yes alarmist. That's fine, subreddit notorious alarmist. 

This CDC directive meant push unvaccinated people fence necessarily anti-vaccine demonstrating vaccine incredibly safe extremely effective preventing spread complications COVID-19, is. 
Continuing tell vaccinated people wear mask shows vaccine effective spreads doubt.

This brilliant messaging shows confidence CDC Dr. Fauci vaccines. think accurately takes account reproductive number, I'm epidemiologist. super-infectious variant, mean one escapes vaccines? That's possible happened yet. never really good idea base decision random people's ""weird looks.""

No, that's brain works. Social pressure biggest motivator. Yup town, 9 14 people work refuse get vaccinated. really feel like quit, already get harassed wearing mask office there‚Äôs still mandate company. one cares even boss. Less go already said could lifted earlier. Given low positive %, I'm betting yes. Yay  It‚Äôs sure starting get safer, think it‚Äôs tad soon it‚Äôs worst timeframe either, let‚Äôs hope doesn‚Äôt balloon cases up. 30k less cases per day. I‚Äôm going give least another 2 weeks start think going maskless office morning (small construction shop 30 mins).. Science didn‚Äôt say end mask mandates. CDC explicitly said mandate end masking. said it‚Äôs local leaders decide do.

Their important advice unvaccinated need continue wear masks. propose followed everyone ditches masks? Less go I‚Äôm fully vaccinated lol ‚Äúgross people‚Äù. ‚ÄúAct like idiot‚Äù makes mad‚Äîpeople like run mouth pro science really anxiety issues. That‚Äôs totally fine‚ÄîI lot severe anxiety too. difference don‚Äôt try force others prevent seeing loved ones enjoying life. take comfort knowing pegged dead rights science denier second comment local Target definitely would call out, even mask-under-nose situations. Walmart didn‚Äôt give fuck. Definitely something that‚Äôs highly location employee dependent. nasal polyps, tonsils, uvula removed. get mild infections every couple years. Ahahah okay things outside house last month, one time encounter children. Maybe handful teens average adult interact kids teens average day. wife‚Äôs work boss hates liar vaccinated knows whose running mouths vaccinated. Today anti maskers show masks many diligent mask wearers walking around maskless. It‚Äôs definitely pressure inducing dynamic. least 2-3 weeks could even hypothetically take (J&amp;J). Masked incorrectly? know need diapers chins /s sick, symptomatic risk others stand greater risk infecting them. 

Not mention taking another crucial ICU bed due preventable risk factor. many things. Skiing, riding bicycle, rock climbing, swimming. lifestyle choices compare spreading germs person willing take couple injections. E484K mutation present B16171, B16172 new dominant variant. AZ vaccine less effective, it'll reason, particular mutation.  4th June I'll part crowd despite one lowest risk categories COVID-19 (it quite low someone age 35 doctor-claimed clean bill health late 2019, right?). That's problem, one knows. literally documentation. unvaccinated people become breeding grounds mutations vaccinations might work on. Everything added body pros cons. Even shoes cons, masks help ways hurt others. think wearing mask full time good long-term.

Public Health England say vaccines 95% effective hospitalisations elderly. 750,000 old people get it, would 37,500 hospitalisations space month. add younger people getting hospitalised, huge hospitalisations unvaccinated. 50,000 hospitalisations, maybe more. point huge amount cases lead spike hospitalisations.  quote movie Independence Day. sure he's getting downvoted. young get quote reference? Lol. I'm guessing math showing even new surge, probably overwhelm hospitals, main concern I'd imagine. Fear keeps dumb ass jumping cliffs. Fear keeps placing comfort health. Fear useful survival tool. data driven decision making, look vaccination levels daily case numbers, Simple that. daily case numbers plummet stay there, take next step ease policy. know indoor spread problem, since way verify vaccination status, larger portion community vaccinated relax policy - rocket science, country even 50% mark, herd immunity 70-80%. know eventually stop wearing masks everyone around stop wearing succumb peer pressure especially uncomfortable wear masks hot summer weather minor illnesses since beginning pandemic! niece healthy 21 year-old played college sports. recently diagnosed unexplained blood clots. never tested positive covid &amp; antibody tests came back negative; nonetheless, still suspicion doctors covid may something it. sister / mother would like know:


Is way definitely connect covid unprovoked case DVT someone age?


Do idea long-term prognosis 21 year-old unprovoked DVT due covid might be?


Thank you!  Indians hardest longest lockdown world. people put lives pause govt asked us to, paid suffered it: loss business, incomes, jobs. Modi government sacrifice? procure vaccines, set national vaccination drive, procure medicine, oxygen concentrators, hospital infrastructure?! 

Nope. PM vaunted throwing vaccines foreign countries PR, ran election rallies, took credit good, blamed states got bad. Yes. Get vaccinated get gifts (like eggs, milk, vegetables), get punished. vaccinated work target - still get fairly uncomfy even vaccinated around large group maskless people. Nothing üßºü•∞ Vaccines still 90% effective B.1.617. people lack intelligence plain simple

thats me(:  Thankfully early. Best luck there. masks protect anyway - protect others (I think 2 year olds wearing N-95s properly). That's part EU CDC equivalent recommend masks kids &lt; 12. 

Those statistics inclusive 60%+ kids getting vaccine - vaccine vary effectiveness 20%-60% given flu season. think *probably* true years vaccinated kid slightly less risk COVID flu - though hospitalizations might still higher (flu hospitalization risk 2x COVID ages 0-4, though death risk similar across age bands hospitalization risk similar 4-18). follow science, masks :) agree benefits getting vaccinated outweigh risks.

I think might missing point, vaccine approved children 12 yet. Yeah better PPE protocol adherence everyone dentist office aside dentist donned n95 face shield right started working me. took changed surgical mask every time stepped away 2 minutes. complained put back came back over. n95 last moment started working me. Virtually employees dicknosing Honestly makes sense. CDC everyone's punching bag, fine. Governors businesses could say ""sorry going CDC"" whenever criticized mask social distancing rules ultimately pass buck. many ways think good CDC take kind ""blame,"" see way, versus making harder businesses maybe governors make call. said, think CDC, technically correct recommendation, may short sighted think way many people lie cause virus spread again, cause deaths potentially create variants vaccines may protect against. probably needed go least another month getting people fully vaccinated past 2 weeks make sure could get close herd immunity possible saying ""things good vaccinated.""

Personally, I'm going careful keep wearing masks businesses, predict cases trend upward again. Hopefully I'm wrong somehow another spike.  employee front door preventing entry requiring everyone put one Kroger Texas. people taking start shopping, everyone enters store mask. California anti-vax issue people unvaccinated people ignore guidelines them. 
 
that's 100% problem. 
 
if workplace enacted policy everyone would stop wearing masks despite openly proudly saying they're getting vaccinated. I‚Äôm going enjoy life too. Sadly thousands people won‚Äôt drop masks early. Nice hand waving Damn, wish country already vaccinating young people. I'm 19 fucking sick mixed regime uni classes. gym lifted mask requirement first day could. Every local restaurant I've since well. 

I think last holdouts probably corporations afraid liability. believe U.S. expect another major wave here. Primarily think people careful, loosening restrictions likely much effect large percentage population vaccinated. No, makes obese person susceptible serious health consequences increases risk death endanger others. really 'one poof' suddenly everything safe? Hundreds billions dollars thousands pharma scientists, plus tens thousands volunteers developed vaccine rolled logistical/organizational miracle putting 3 4 million shots arms per day. 15 months Herculean effort, poof, get see benefits work. continue wearing masks, going remain safe been? Time adapt? Adapt how? Hate masks much? masks distancing. Got it. Thanks Why? Target literally gives vaccines. Anyone works target CVS inside get easily vaccinated. sell KF94s kids. KF94 South Korean standard involves filtration 94+% particles 0.4 microns top head, protects aerosols well. scared buy those, try force masks rest population irrational fear something 0.002% chance happening happen kid. say like bad thing? ŒìŒµŒπŒ± œÉŒ±œÇ Œö. Spyropoulos,

I hope good day, thank this! know actual stats likelihood getting clot vaccines j&amp;j AZ? know lot hype media, I'm curious medical consensus is, least data showing now. Basically fear warrented something sensationalised media reporting? 
Thank you!  still lot people immuno comprised little vaccine effectiveness even 2 doses. choose get risk First that's stupid law. even baring that. law prohibits buying vaccine produced China, Pfizer produced China, distributed Fosun, private owned Chinese company. 

It's law, votes politics. question effective vaccine? Seychelles data indicates might 50% effective, huge impact long-term attempts herd immunity.  assume 11 6 year olds checked already missed notice? plane, last February, parents grabbed breakfast restaurant right shit hit fan. lady behind us (and uncomfortably close tables) literally hacked entire time there. remember mother saying times gross sick stay home. 

Like clockwork 2 days later started get incredibly sick. covid? dunno, got antibody test April negative. might flu. 

But like goes planes, don‚Äôt go eat crowded places you‚Äôre sick, assholes. Walmart dropped mask requirement Target kept it, decided I'd bite bullet pick Walmart whenever needed go one (not go either often). glad though, because, Walmart...  I'm pretty happy church responded state. recommended following restrictions, interfere individuals personal choices. people watching online since returned person services August, worn masks mandate lifted recently, pretty much returned normal. Communion offering changed slightly, way affects meaning hold. Singing going since returned. people distanced, many hugged... them. cases, minor. Christian requires church, people, building. exact opposite, went King Soopers Saturday, 3 people store saw without masks. we‚Äôre home carrying thing, doorbells smart pods make it.  Ok, understand scientific method works? claims CDC making right replicated scientific community. enough time find new variants effect vaxxed adults unvaxxed children. take years get kind data. Right making educated guess without lot information. US covid made political trying make sides happy right now. new variants concerning enough Moderna Phizer working towards making booster shots. Fantastic news. means two antivax/antimask coworkers wearing masks foreseeable future rest us to. piss off. There‚Äôs way they‚Äôre going to. don‚Äôt want vaccinated. lie been. realize scenario NEVER going away? There‚Äôs least 20-30 percent population get vaccination US. us forever. vaccines work, like stated it‚Äôs time return normal. Even vaccinated ‚Äúget sick‚Äù said symptoms way less unvaccinated. life now. Copy/paste 

(Edit) sure read whole thing downvoting first lines, it‚Äôs unreasonable)

Due extremely bad case Trypanophobia time caused multiple panic attacks around needles

Gotten point heart attack could well happen, resulted getting violent past (note control actions state)

So many methods try combat including Xanax/expose therapy things advised try get it, prevail

Unfortunately doctors area believe issues real anti vaxxer performance order discourage others getting harm doctors, laws show would result ignoring issues idiots would result forcing chances result heart attack

It‚Äôs issue wanting it, want it, way I‚Äôm risking anything bad happening once, TWICE

I suggested afew different approaches try straight refuse take consideration I‚Äôm really really worried, wish stayed stricter Yeah...and long flight finally get destination, want get cold days. I'd pretty worried person something risky! Total number cases increasing **is increase cases.** Nice surrender. 

You‚Äôve told I‚Äôm dense several times I‚Äôm apparently troll explaining plain detail you‚Äôre incorrect. 

At point realize you‚Äôre projecting?  it‚Äôs removing one level barrier cannot get vaccinated. risk transmission much less parties masking. frustration comes people still shop groceries essentials, stores saying ‚Äúeveryone honest‚Äù removes secondary level protection. everyone luxury grocery delivery able leave kids home sitter. know get downvoted think are. Kids still allowed vaccinated think *is* early.

The reason get downvoted oblivion (correct) point kids get COVID symptoms almost universally recover fine.

The reason placate really know long-term effects even asymptomatic COVID it'll mean future.

Just COVID ""just flu"", treating asymptotic cases age like really worries sucks hear makes sense it. China probably saw happening India decided need pull stops get population vaccinated contagious variant started ravaging them. China giving away vaccines time hospitals collapsing Covid running unchecked would horrible look them. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:
  
[Vaccine FAQ Part FAQ Part appointment bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*   Vaccine hesitant people might like ""oh fuck ones going wear masks need get asap get covid"" ""the CDC says I'm vaccinated wear mask, I'll get vaccinated"" Yep. I'm science says do.

Are also aware seat belts 100% effective preventing car fatalities? that's problem how? people wish wear mask bit longer, let them. They're harming anyone continuing wear mask. People different reasons continue wear mask, may live someone who's yet vaccinated can't vaccinated, may need bit time get used idea wearing one, may waiting immune response kick automatic vaccine.Just let be. 


Besides, way early get rid mask mandate, lot people still unvaccinated. let's forget CDC adamant people wear mask, advise people stop wearing them. can't blame people making decisions.  Every 60 seconds Africa, minute passes Meanwhile, went relative‚Äôs house weekend (all adults fully vaccinated), said relative‚Äôs kid stood sitting bean bag chair, sneezed directly head two times. Baker backs August 1st deadline, I‚Äôm sure anything possible. even click link? graph cases total number cases happened. cannot go down. number new cases gone continuously since mask mandate announced. point vaccinated risk people wearing mask impact you. 

If arent vaccinated, go get one, continue wear mask then. overall unvaccinated people less risk low case count. 9 month old got flu vaccine (2 shots) reason. don‚Äôt option COVID. Can‚Äôt wear mask age either unfortunately. think fully vaccinated people, like wife. due diligence, kept safe, wore masks got full vaccinated soon could. said, still wore mask weekend stores require huge percentage people still wearing want look place get dirty looks. seriously though putting vaccine card lanyard, backstage pass style though. better air filtration

This known better part year. However, lot cheaper say ""wear cloth mask stay 6 feet apart"" tell businesses upgrade ventilation systems. J J efficacy ""UK variant"" B.1.1.7 
I can't seem find statistics this. anyone info? Obviously. mean, even secret, open anyone functioning brain basic understanding decisions made. don‚Äôt take kids target. That‚Äôs happy place wander around without lol Actually, eat affects others enormous foundational ways. eat probably one biggest ways influence world others. ingredients, packaging used, level sustainability farming meat harvesting produce, eat HUGE. It‚Äôs bigger vaccine. Way bigger.

It‚Äôs definitely 100% personal. Lmao can't real. Definitely trolling, well played Well guess right, right. HOWEVER, context conversation, debate goverment anything want long ‚Äúthe greater good‚Äù answer no.

I also think important note per statement, CONGRESS authorithy pass LAWS. congress passing actual laws alot different governor president mayor unilaterally signing executive order emergency mandate. big difference Lol entire state still masked :( 10 million shipped US, blocked way? Sorry, much CDC done pandemic either shocked simply disappointed me. 
I highly doubt gave much consideration children decision. 
The quick interview director made abundantly clear. 
I‚Äôm sure comment really popular‚Ä¶ evictions, one. end state emergency 15th June, followed end CDC moratorium 30th June, housing courts races. Foreclosures also, forebearance tied state emergency status. thanks replies, question answered, u/thawkth, meant guidelines fully vaccinated stop wearing mask. He/she wants everyone unhealthy are. Thus, make gym miserable possible. know CDC? still wear masks state‚Äôs mandate still place, never bothered me. think it‚Äôs ridiculous act like children unacceptable level risk COVID literally never true. kids odds dying covid lower odds getting cancer deadly motor vehicle accident. 
You can‚Äôt protect anyone anything 100%. Kids risk covid almost 0 It‚Äôs premature. worried reason still unable get vaccine, take necessary precautions. fully vaccinated since end March. natural course things. Everyone know wants 18 could gotten it. 18 1-2 weeks removed first shot lime 80 plus. states slightly slower others again, use barometer. There‚Äôs greater 60 percent country received 1 shot. moved return normal timeline. conditions don‚Äôt allow get shots deal thing always deal with. always susceptible illness time. know that‚Äôs harsh take it‚Äôs really life. rich want vaccinate , poor can't vaccinate.

Eitherway suffer surge COVID. opening going trigger pretty much masks anywhere, puts unvaccinated children risk. course kids wearing masks, anti-vaxxers wearing them, doubly risk force even restrictions kids. think person get many dates moving forward. Fred Meyer (pnw Kroger) still masks. children continue wear masks/social distance essential stores still offer curbside pickup delivery avoid crowds. Schools still require either hit herd immunity vaccinate children. always going point mask mandates got dropped everyone vaccinated people never be.

I don‚Äôt understand people feel need make others live unnecessary restrictions choose continue extremely safe. You‚Äôre welcome continue living lockdown child vaccinations come late year/early next year. common source infection as-is

as-is assume they'd take greater precautions plenty rules place health inspectors... nope.  there's regulation. Life safer children 12 get vaccinated obviously. opening going trigger pretty much masks anywhere, puts unvaccinated children risk. course kids wearing masks, anti-vaxxers wearing them, doubly risk force even restrictions kids. worried healthcare workers- people much important protect pandemic us normal people- would enough PPE get us through. made judgment call telling people wear masks could saved frontline. sometime realized mistake corrected. wrong regarding masks said so- doesn‚Äôt change fact organization CDC one expert sources dealing diseases outbreak responses. No. I've seen plenty kids, wearing masks, none wearing actual N95 mask *because masks made fit children, much less would child suffer wearing one.*

Keep making insulting assumptions though, suits lack intelligence. Hi Doc. PE November 2020 quarantining exposure covid positive co-worker. 5 covid tests, negative going hospital. talked woman works hospital lab recently told time November getting alot false negative covid tests due new variants going around. hematology team cant find cause PE. think possible covid caused PE covid tests time detect new variants? seen similar cases? vaccine better vaccine. know shunned AstraZeneca vaccine linking quoting bunch different studies it, entire response used 1 word like. side wearing mask store 4 months children get vaccinated? isn‚Äôt true. anecdotal evidence vaccines help slow transmission. No, nothing peer reviewed, real world data. also haven‚Äôt seen data shows vaccinated people asymptomatically shedding virus, I‚Äôd like source that. don‚Äôt fight this, still wearing mask. think people still wearing masks time, think vaccinated people wearing mask time issue. Missing bolts eh - dense you? ""Medial Procedure"" dictionary. ROFL pressure normal Memorial Day Weekend start summer season Jersey Shore grows enormously every day. 10 days acknowledge change policies accept one going follow restrictions can't arrest entire state. You‚Äôre right. Vaccinated people safe. That‚Äôs CDC said. 

HOWEVER, went say unvaccinated NEED WEAR MASKS. everyone needs wear masks mass transit, hospitals, schools, prisons. CDC said calling end masking you, them, local authorities masks continue required. 

If I‚Äôm business local leader want follow cdc advice don‚Äôt see require unvaccinated mask without requiring everyone. intentionally fail following guidance?  UK using vaccine available use States. Astra Zenaca. know probably spelt wrong. Several countries stopped using it. issue causing blood clots. started 1 250 000 saying less 1 50 000 getting blood clots. Three people Canada died. million shots given 3 people died vaccine 3 many. Way died day covid.

I still got vaccinated. September believe Pfizer planning put authorization ages 2-11. took 1 month FDA approve ages 11-15 emergency use expect take longer authorize ages 2-11. would expect shots age November. outdoor mask mandate lifted April 30th Logistics hard. going take time start everything back up. something still closed/restricted necessarily mean someone holding back. Sure, don‚Äôt disagree there. long culture allows exist together that‚Äôs fine. mean would huge issue believe lol Ok...

How rebut point. anything one 2 weeks getting J J reduce blood clot risk? 
Thank service. Tell idiot family members walking around mesh masks last 6 months.  Thank much! I'm 25 get doses Pfizer vaccine already. figured I'd ask case anyone else wondering. Thanks answering....and bless poor guy!  went store updated policy vast majority still wearing masks. Like 90%+  Show picture child young receive vaccine also wearing N95 mask. wait.

i get havent mall store last year cause want keep family safe, ive seen 2 year olds n95s, infants covered scarves, domed strollers, etc. ""gotcha"" pointing clearly little understanding necessary sample sizes statistics   think they're banking idea many people wearing anyway. Mainly kids haven‚Äôt vaccinated yet yes, kids less likely spread COVID, parents felt decision came soon CDC director hasn‚Äôt put reality children getting green light COVID vaccinations yet mind decision process. first thing avoid blood clots altogether, best way get vaccinated. getting vaccinated reduce chance getting severe COVID. Secondly, unlucky enough get blood clots, treat way always giving blood thinners. Usually give injectable blood thinners patient leaves hospital, give blood thinner 4-6 weeks reassess. side effect blood thinning medication bleed, course. Although bleeding risk newer agents quite low, usually 1%, major bleeding risk life-threatening. 
  
There long-term effects blood clot COVID. leg, post-thrombotic syndrome 5-20% patients. includes chronic swelling and/or pain. you‚Äôve clot lungs, especially due COVID, anecdotal reports clots take lot longer heal compared pre-COVID clots. worst long-term effect chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension, basically blood clot lung resolved causes long-term congestion pulmonary veins cause long-term effects difficulty breathing, fatigue, low oxygen, etc. things worrisome main things worry long-term. 
  
If unlucky one six women developed blood clots cerebral sinuses, different kind blood clot slow-moving system surrounding brain tissue. types blood clots take long time resolve. Usually, give alternate blood thinner, direct thrombin inhibitor. patient stable, transition DOAC dose-adjusted warfarin.  feel you, Movies stopped here. Built home theater years ago never go back big theater. ‚ÄúNowhere say fucking clue‚Äù. I‚Äôm fully aware. apparently explain ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt know‚Äù means, hence explanation. 

While subject knowing, care show says ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt know‚Äù, sudden care getting someone else‚Äôs statement correct?

Or make up?

I say CAN‚ÄôT something like learn draw, realistically that‚Äôs true. course it‚Äôs possible learn draw. 

Just like saying vaccinated people can‚Äôt spread. whole, people understand vaccines work. say can‚Äôt won‚Äôt spread knowing ALWAYS chance vaccines almost never 100% effective. That‚Äôs don‚Äôt use word impossible, claim someone used word impossible. 

Words meanings reason. pick chose meanings interpretations suit argument you‚Äôre trying make. 1% low though)

What basing on? Well, permanently mandated wear mask, dingus. move. Extremely premature now. Yeah honestly think you‚Äôre right, guess used anti-vaxxers also anti-mask grouped together. know people aren‚Äôt getting vaccine still mask nice I‚Äôd still concerned since masks aren‚Äôt 100% effective, especially less people wearing going forward. I‚Äôd concerned severity catch it. Children 2 can‚Äôt wear masks. relate big. I‚Äôve OCD life, untreated undiagnosed ~February last year IIRC, haven‚Äôt really worried germs shit happened. ‚ÄúShit sucks‚Äù 100% right. Expecting everyone rip masks day 1 never gonna happen reason didnt start wearing masks time. 

Some people wore day 1, people forced people never it. true masking. Wearing mask hot dinner weather. fun! It‚Äôs actually mandated air travel, face fines federal charges, airlines don‚Äôt choice matter actual group protesting would gladly. Im interested starting group. üòÑ I've brought many people. Many seem unaware. would cut piece baby's penis dubious ""medical reasons"" religious practice that's done without consent. CDC always inept, corrupt, easily bends political/social/corporate pressures. Look Lyme disease want see epidemic literally created lots ways IMO that‚Äôs exactly what‚Äôs going happen. flattening curve turn spike upward within 2 months states lift mandates. Maine got confirmation weekend India variant, according local media (via English health org) could bypass trust science. 

You always trust person reporting results science. recommendations. 

I‚Äôm sure sorts wonderful science happens everyday CDC. people running mouthpieces political masters. Maybe haven‚Äôt fully vaccinated yet? I'm glad top comments basically saying ""That's fine, choice,"" lately, small number commenters getting nasty towards people say want keep wearing masks. ain't hurting anyone, peace mind important, especially people health anxiety. bet kids get one. basically situation even acknowledge risk terms flu covid new scary. media help this. Went grocery storehere Philly suburbs. allow vaccinated wear masks. Everybody still wearing masks person. seen like 50 people, masked. following science. CDC often full crap often follow science. That's right now, folded political social pressure recognize it. link:

""In 2018, study team including CDC scientists analyzed published vaccine safety data adjuvanted pH1N1 vaccines (arenaprix-AS03, Focetria-MF59, Pandemrix-AS03) 10 global study sites. Researchers detect associations vaccines narcolepsy.""

In fact link provided supports point, data showed link vaccine question narcolepsy. Yeah knows. year might wear mask subway there‚Äôs bad flu. still missing point.

The CDC guidance effectively means *everyone* go maskless way check vaccination status. Even Fauci said going ""honor system"". Yup motto mask comfort level. different everyone depending health/job/children etc think people cautious 2 weeks Republican man bad correct considering guy . good Texas good day .  look stupid you, stupid person, whatever.  
Once again, obesity public health costs, effect health anyone else. Unlike COVID, deadly disease spreads person person. comparison 2, especially board. Nobody cares standing next fat person bus, sure care standing next someone COVID. understand difference, health detriment. Hey, look everyone, it‚Äôs child abuse. Saw someone say moving arm around right helps muscle soreness. that, mostly tired. say sleep well. don‚Äôt understand efficacy numbers, even breakthrough cases, almost always mild.

Learn properly measure risk you‚Äôd lot calmer now. better last year. year better this. fucking way adding 40 Million. Even 2021 2022 twice bad 2020 global scale still wont get 40 million. make sense dude. vulnerable across globe going get vaccinated. 

I aware serious global issue need approach carefully estimate fucking nonsense. But, adapting science... that's major criticism going here. inept scientific review  I‚Äôm pretty much used now. 

Yes, even worse that‚Äî patient literally swarms multiple different ‚Äúquasispecies‚Äù virus within body given time. That‚Äôs genetically unstable HIV is. Ok, fine. Maybe looked actual numbers instead guessing handwaving whose estimates trust. : Doctor: raise hand going 3 years old 

Kid: raises hand 

Doctor: put Hi Dr Spyropoulous,

I contracted COVID March 2020, POTS, related dysautonomia circulation. I‚Äôm wondering seeing something especially successful recovering post COVID POTS long haulers? extremely debilitating  that's full pop. Including anything pulse 35% population fully-vaccinated, 60% least one dose. One dose 80%-90% effective two weeks. add natural immunity top 60% figure.

Obviously it‚Äôs good thing people still getting vaccinated, we‚Äôre point open without substantial increases infections, hospitalizations, deaths. Israel‚Äôs COVID cases started tank 50% population vaxxed, we‚Äôre now. Plus vulnerable also vaccinated‚Äî85% people 65+ demographic vaxxed, represent 80% COVID deaths. people even wear masks pandemic

those assholes still wearing masks vaccinated

the CDC announcing insanity wolf meme. like, close MAYBE ending thing, hey lets let disease spread mutate further. good job! better example? risk health life situation significantly higher kid walking around grocery store without masks worn point time. know that, right? No, think CDC still saying take anything like Tylenol beforehand. pharmacy asks insurance card, say insurance. bill insurance, parents might see explanation benefits. vaccine free either way. even get irony you? exactly anti-maskers. Oh man, you‚Äôre losing now‚Ä¶

I‚Äôm pansy, I‚Äôm trying stay alive. would nice elderly parents could survive too. public health know vaccinated wear masks, go places, stronger variants emerge finished dealing mess lockdowns mask wearing needs happen fucking doomed.  That's evolution works.

Mutations occur specific pressures (in case, vaccines), become *prevalent* pressures. vaccine-resistant variant likely occur US anywhere else world. You‚Äôre not, you‚Äôre trolling people fake internet points. vast majority epidemiologists disagree decision, Biden administration decided push forward political economic reasons. God forbid low wage workers continue see pay rises compensate danger past year general shittiness working conditions. understand limited temporary reduction deliveries expected caught later stage,"" spokesman European Commission said, declining say many doses short week's delivery be. Fauci saying 2 weeks guidance going change vaccinated people.

I saw CNN least twice saying that.

Having said that, messaging CDC stellar. think need understand reason lot people arms lot people flat-out traumatized all. lockdown, fearing loved ones, hearing friends getting long-COVID, blame people skeptical. everybody's brains wired flip switch back normal, think CDC full political hacks, difficult year processing going take time.

I encourage least empathetic instead berating people, keep encouraging believe science trust people studying epidemiology decades.  think people would interested getting preventing death. Again, weighing risk perceived risk vaccine itself. govt force people engage dangerous activities (sky diving?). think something thats going body, choice. CDC cancelled. know, I‚Äôd ashamed typed dumb comment. Nope, not. soon. hope vaccinated! hate correct answer. nice 4 year old feel isolated, asking upcoming heartache.

She admitted children's hospital week IVIG treatments address MIS-C Kawasaki symptoms. Others going get game too. die. 

But hey. Muh freedoms. can't ask proof vaccination. ordering wear mask.

And back stupid hole go. mean, I'm going use masks winter now. smart Restrictions Texas lifted March. still decline cases. Even Fauci said didn‚Äôt know why. it‚Äôs pretty simple. vaccinated people means less risk people feel need wear mask without mandate. people around still masking large stores malls. mean it‚Äôs norm always someone. it‚Äôs unusual. yeah anytime you‚Äôre train it‚Äôs norm see 10% passengers wearing masks.

Plenty people wear train time, precaution others. course sick. CDC DONE

and prepared guidance businesses, schools, etc announced change guidance. Give people goal, give tools intermediate period don‚Äôt herd immunity many people protected. still lots groups can‚Äôt get vaccine, certain populations still haven‚Äôt chance vaccinated aren‚Äôt even opposed it.  I'll check out, seems accurate! Hello thank AMA. Question 1: heterozygous Factor V Leiden several bouts superficial thrombophlebitis two DVT‚Äôs (I‚Äôm Xarelto life now). DVTs place femoral vein popliteal vein. reason arriving matter veins narrowing that‚Äôs bottleneck?

Question 2: read recently using crisper gene editing Factor V bleeding disorder cured. simple cure factor V clotting disorder? ever become mainstream prohibitively expensive banned places? Crisper doesn‚Äôt seem thing Canada. Seriously. I‚Äôm amazed number people apparently personally offended see someone mask aren‚Äôt legally required be. amazon.com e-commerce website allowed posts comments. 

If believe made mistake, please let us know.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* statistical point view risk kids low. Thats people tell you. parent would extra careful kids since months (i keep reading maybe September), younger kids hopefully get vaccinated. careful til then? Theres kid school mom teaches got really bad. cousins son ok still hospitalized (he‚Äôs baby though). feels best you. do. boggles mind people get reality masks always pretty marginal effect. 

This clear lack real statistical difference countries states different mask policies. Target signs said masks required. odds hourly employee saying anything people walked without masks always low! typed odd grammar, clear point. read ""70-85% people US never vaccinated"" ""we'll never reach 70-85% vaccinated US"" I‚Äôm waiting next excuse coworkers one. introduce /r/raisedbynarcissists/ ? Right lockdowns widespread mask usage. think change lockdowns end masks stop used? Looks like one living rock. Grow brain.

All asked kids haven‚Äôt approved vaccinated yet. Apparently angry person. I'd say worse gone. desire fit means we're using social pressure discourage people wearing masks, since they're going stick out.

And there's lot people (anyone got first shot universal eligibility opened up) going considered immune weeks still. schools still session filled people vaccinated. CDC's timing makes sense. absolutely should. downside wearing mask seems premature me. Im young would probably okay got covid(but dont want find out), im less sure vaccine affect autoimmune disorder. 

I think it‚Äôs nbd wear store, I‚Äôll continue to. mainly don‚Äôt want redo last year time frame -post vaccination- patients risk clots? time reached say patients longer risk?(ie. made 30 days won‚Äôt get one now..) protected PPE supplies redirecting shipments beginning January. Hospitals don‚Äôt buy PPE isle 7 Home Depot either. admitted lying given excuse doesn‚Äôt make sense. 

It‚Äôs still mystery lied. Maybe vaccination could help? flu, vaccination uptake usually low, help efficacy high.  I'm going keep masking up, despite fully vaxd, know (the CDC) expect businesses enforce ""if fully vax'd, need mask, vax'd, mask up!"" maintain public trust. Unvax'd/anti vaxers wanting ANYTHING CDC saying wear masks, given two options assuming unmasked poeple fully vax'd others assume I'm choose wear mask...I'll take latter now. Hospitalization rate 0.18%. death rate 0.01%. basically act god territory.

So kids unlikely get serious case die.

**And no-one stopping families still wearing masks, social distancing etc.** Tl;Dr : Early detection means treat clots successfully. Recent data reported delaying Pfizer's booster 3 months increased antibodies levels dramatically, 3.5 times higher people got standard 3 weeks. See data elderly, based know immunology would expect similar numbers younger populations. don‚Äôt care changing minds. want still forced wear masks indoors businesses schools. Hopefully. fact 500 people day still dying scare people, know will.

Edit: put things perspective people, roughly 6% daily deaths US due covid. That's sudrenly dropping mask requirements like perplexing - open everything back up, get students back in-person learning, travel safely, etc, keeping mask requirements place reach whatever x% vaccinated needed continue driving case numbers. maybe already point, CDC mentioned it. modeling papers I've found suggest need really high vaccination rates safely drop mask requirements without another big surge. Maybe based overly conservative estimates? regardless think prioritize opening things normal capacity ditching masks. stores Kroger umbrella still requiring masks. local Fred Meyer put even bigger sign front door stating masks required entry.

Home Depot also still requiring masks. signage prominent though. basically, CDC actually aligns current science basic public health policies event like = agree

when bend social political pressure rescind restrictions early, despite backing data/science = agree

however, everyone scientist like equipped see situation thus trust CDC. however, super fucked rescinding mask mandates science social perspective. basically bending morons country without really knowing clear yet. crazy, totally par course CDC know history many infectious diseases. stuff harder point last year, needed people cooperate, totally true young helps prevent severe cases covid. risk children incredibly low, we're acting like isn't. Yes I‚Äôm fully vaccinated, husband. son 8. We‚Äôre going continue safe possible son also vaccinated. I‚Äôm curious masking individual community. weren‚Äôt replying you, replying statement: ‚Äúyoure [sic] hypochondriac missed lot life live constant fear‚Äù. incredibly offensive stupid. Get KN95 mask wear worried.

There lot ""Masks protect you, protect others!"" going around, applies cloth masks. KN95 masks protect you; that's they're designed for.

Anyone unvaccinated immunocompromised, please stop yelling people wearing masks, get KN95 protect yourself. They're expensive, widely available. could tell patient one thing help recognise early signs thrombocytopenia, would be? I've got vaccine age kid home, yeah I'm still generally masking whatnot. 

If whole household vaccinated, think would enough defense depth from: dramatically reduced risk infection + reduced risk transmission + nearly eliminated risk severe disease worry much bringing/spreading home.

My county still pretty strict rules anyway, public.  blot clots (such ones possibly developing corona vaccination) treated? side-effects treatment long term effect blod clot/the treatment? Bro went target mask, half vax'd, left disgusted people. absolute zoo. felt bad employees. sea noses people taking masks cough talk. place mask requirements regardless pandemic. found job board online collects all-remote jobs? looking jobs industry offering remote? hypothetical scenario:

If someone fully vaccinated, would otherwise considered high risk therefore eligible monoclonal antibody treatment (e.g., Regeneron) test positive, reason seek out?

Tldr: could vaccinated interfere contraindicate monoclonal antibody treatment?

Thanks! Let‚Äôs hope stays way. Kids extremely low risk. kids covid slightly worse flu public complaining. people get vaccinated. can't, alternatives KF94, KN95, N95, social distancing. 

Vaccination best method protection. Anyone concerned walk get shot today. true. always ask leave room bit talk teenager alone. Yeah definitely pumped announcement! waiting Boston update guidelines. I'm hoping add arbitrary 3 weeks state's date. way worded comment earlier made seem like part anti masking crowd days CDC approved masks. saying fully went along b*** moan entire time saying ""I'm CDC says""? Far many people proven care slightest health safety, care feel weird seeing protect myself? We're charge safety, one else decide makes sense us individually (while considering CDC/gov guidelines course). get sick often lasts longer people enjoyed dealing that.

Reporting Ben Blanchard, editing Louise Heavens BUT, TAKING AWAY RIGHTS MAKING HIDE FACE! JOE BIDEN TAKING AWAY FREEDOM? Yeah, live western suburbs feel like live different universe hear online. I‚Äôve never seen anyone throw fit wearing mask. Literally everyone every store I‚Äôve last year wearing masks one seems annoyed it. took felt like forever find vaccine appointment soon appeared, they‚Äôd booked. Things probably change haven‚Äôt seen terrible things hear online. live NC everyone around still wears masks literally everywhere. Even outdoors decent amount people wear Even 70% vaccinated UK going back normal life. come government believe vaccines?  Fake, made TV doctor disagrees expert academics career civil servants top field - cares?   Employers also shouldnt able dictate time off, yet world live in. didn‚Äôt say employers make mandatory either. said insurance companies may decide require retain coverage due costs associated potential hospitalization something that‚Äôs pretty much preventable point. It‚Äôs always money.  Besides prestige hosting event, one big motivators tourist dollars Olympics bring in. Hosting cities spend ton money build bring existing infrastructure Olympic standards, getting hundreds thousands (if millions) people coming - importantly, spending money local economy - one things make holding event profitable (or least break-even) city. 

If take away crowds, take away financial incentive, billions dollars dropped improving infrastructure completely lost. Japan would choose reschedule played Olympic events empty stadiums since cost latter ever recouped, delayed event could still make *some* money. Yes, selfish antimasker. 

It's hard, plus fun another wearable item decorate express yourself. thanks.

I wearing mask unless business requires it, masking deadly flu season later year either. plan mask forever? never know deadly diseases circulating population. seems new narrative shift blame decision makers like modi et al ""the people"", obvious reasons.  detachable car seat, get covers go car seat take child store. protects balance seems shift one way, towards ""protection"" protecting others seems shift way towards ""comfort"". occured everyone views way might consider terrible person do? good reason kids need go target. Take outside.

Not even going go concept parents without constant nannies sometimes need take kids them. Obviously idea lost some. I'm 16 live less minute away CVS. state requires proof parental consent. Fuck 'em. NJ made right call tbh, way business owners enforce masking unvaccinated - that's logistical issue CDC think of, he's making simpler mandate mask indoors everyone - keep simple. Kids aged 12-15 got approved Pfizer, also buys time - kids held hostage irresponsible unmasked unvaccinated individuals. Wish state made call.  Awesome, thank you.

Not sure downvote brigade got me, asking honest question. make legislative policy group probably less 5% population

Who wants tell him? Thank much. means lot me.

I've getting downvoted oblivion comment. So, again, thank much helpful information variants.

Have nice day hope someone helps might need way done don‚Äôt go Target often (hooray parking lot pickup), one time stopped woman walked maskless. door watcher asked put mask speed-walked away. Door lady (prob 20yrs old) nada. 

I can‚Äôt blame though. people nutso. worth getting spit screamed $15/hr? think position reasonable, entitled it. point someone choices wear mask unvaccinated hurting really hurting people anymore.

Then according response, masks never needed first place. Around 5% population immunocompromised. Also, finding vaccine may less effective conjunction certain conditions like rheumatoid arthritis. 

I suggesting everyone eligible get vaccine basic humanely decent thing gets it. live lives. old you? mean vaccine free free Uber/Lyft can‚Äôt use debit card ride bus. change it, restock whatever. eventually make us wonder around pick junk.  area don‚Äôt. It‚Äôs sign door nothing more. place enforced I‚Äôve Costco That's wild. Hope get fired it. Willing admit I‚Äôm ignorant non trivial amount people medically unable get vaccine wouldn‚Äôt also killed many diseases neither gave one wet fart spreading March 2020? Assuming are, yeah telling tens millions people stay inside mask (how long exactly? rest lives? Til reach ‚Äúzero covid‚Äù? (Which even Vietnam New Zealand incapable doing) small amount edge cases unreasonable. You‚Äôre basically saying remain hostage lazy anti science people 100% population vaccinated (by point protection might worn early vaccinated individuals, case we‚Äôd conveniently go back step 1)  go ahead ignore science. 

Cite science used recent CDC decision. entire point change send message vaccine works masks going necessary anymore. sends message, caveat would like people wait little longer people finish vaccinations. really contradict science, implementing carefully.

As long send core message, think okay, though I'm happy state earlier CA is. done ""once 80% population area vaccinated mask come off"" people would've encouraging one another get vaccinated. Could've even made race states 2yo 4yo really taken anywhere pandemic, started take playdates (parents) vaccinated close friends. trying keep catching far less concerned me, wife, high risk FIL (also vaccinated). think people pick chose battles kids (like, we're going take eat us indoors yet) probably fine. cases young kids getting severe effects COVID, they're much risk flu whooping cough stuff given kids young respond COVID. Science never going give precise date. always going matter judgment. better nothing would get without question. Yes hehe Nope. two master‚Äôs degrees would suggest otherwise. 

I don‚Äôt believe nationalized healthcare solve problems lead many comorbitities poor people higher risk Covid. see someone without mask doesn‚Äôt mean anti-vax. lot changed since start this. vaccine given confidence go maskless outside. Don‚Äôt try shame people following numbers experts guidance  problem. 

If don‚Äôt mind saying, issue probably way phrased question. British English lot nuances question would sound aggressive British person, criticising us. put please thanks (possibly twice!!) get respondes. Like ‚Äúplease could someone explain me...‚Äù FWIW, probably nearly year kid day care. agree none advice/guidance helpful little kids. really confusing safe.

It's really hard choice make, felt rely community people daycare make life work (both work, kids social development). kid went 1 year old room (no masks) 2 year old room (masks day) Q3 last year. amazed fast 2 year olds pick mask etiquette. 2 year old ask mask remind us forget walk/drive.

Anyway, that's two cents hope helps. made long, I'd probably go least months see covid cases respond. FWIW daycare loosening masking requirements. going get downvoted, seen slap face countries suffering new wave. know exact numbers, US producing 100m doses mRNA doses month, means least 80m stored somewhere used, US already suplus today. feared cared kids truly, would still wear mask abundance caution care. It‚Äôs literally easiest thing do. Employers able make vaccines mandatory. Real world effectiveness 76.7% among patients Mayo health clinic system February April. Unfortunately, virus sequenced dont data effectiveness specific variants. Joann (the fabric craft store). I'm SE KY Yes does. actual new information CDC use make decision?

War Middle East, escalating border crisis, rising inflation, deletion Arizona election database. Hope feel better Southeastern KY I‚Äôm thinking getting either J&amp;j vaccine Pfizer vaccine. keep hearing J&amp;J one less effective. shed light this? one get increase chances getting COVID-19?  Yeah couldn‚Äôt wait another month least 50 percent vaccinated businesses time adapt instead left scramble. Pussies lmao Older article 90 Yeah, circulation better plane cramped there. Airborne became thing people always got sick planes. knows, big deal certainly expect others wear it. Baked ""Follow Science"" mantra mistaken belief hold similar bedrock values.  People short hand ""Follow science"" everyone believes protecting life worthwhile goal expenses science/statistics lead us similar conclusions.

Unfortunately realize people actually give shit others, that's ""Follow science"" falls flat. I'm young, I'm healthy, think virus real, wearing mask biggest infringement freedom since slavery, exactly supposed follow science to? meaningless phrase goal saving people covid. Yeah really going depend county store in, quality management, quality local population (asking meth heads wannabe gangsters punisher-chic rednecks mask immediately dangerous health). ton factors one anecdote like saying ""no Target enforced it"" asinine, especially lot evidence contrary. Heya Doc, thanks this!

I recently joined ever-growing group COVID long haulers acute 2-week phase March. risks associated long haulers developing blood clots require hospitalization? symptoms similar patients clots visit doc, tell blood work came back fine (for pulmonary embolism) send home. frustrating. advice could offer would amazing, thank work! Tennessee here. Friday, kid's school district made masks optional starting TODAY, including schools kids young vaccinated. feel like nobody cares kids. faith humanity already pretty low, plummeted. semantics I'm arguing.

Why can't people understand also care fear children even though I'm mostly done wearing mask. tried sign appointment vaccine, first morning available group, first appointments mid May. pick somwhere 40 minutes away get one near end April. first shot. everyone chance get vaccinated fully protected yet. Same, done shit either. bad example, wearing seatbelt protects you, others. wearing seatbelt train suppose.

There's good reason kids need go target. Take outside. Wear something like ""I Voted"" sticker vaccinated. plenty supply approved ages age approved. enough them.

The best thing people 15 younger adult population get vaccinated. Simple that. Exactly. know full well unvaccinated people go around wearing masks anyway. looked decided big detriment ending thought. Costco vaccination rate 65 extremely high even areas low overall vaccination rates.

The US healthcare system getting overwhelmed unless new variant escapes vaccines (does currently exist).

That mean nobody get sick die, like before. math work out. Yes anecdote trumps millions millions cases recorded evidence. common American thing hospital sue patients? Genuinely curious. check comments. I've always felt way. I'm alarmism says variants gonna new pandemic something like that, think safe withdraw restrictions. birth control years, doctors never really discussed anything blood clots ever. I‚Äôve birth control due side effects, I‚Äôm much older, I‚Äôm unsure want get back (although really wish could stayed it). study examines effects blood clots birth control either got vaccine tested positive Covid? tried searching reputable studies, I‚Äôve seen anecdotes. Vaccination passports illegal free society, COVID poses little risk kids. vaccine passports implemented would prove ""conspiracy theorists"" right along whole thing power grab government control. Wait...social distance people vaccinated well mr mayor hell would know isn‚Äôt.?!! reason get teachers back school wrong. Children huge vector disease. Noooooooo common flu deadlier Corona children. They're risk due respect, going take information recognized experts, like Dr. Emily Landon University Chicago. It‚Äôs easy call businesses chicken shit requiring proof vaccination, remember way small business US large corps like Target. made nightmare 2020 many instances still struggling *so many* ways, often faced lose-lose scenarios. imagine one small business require passports? You‚Äôd become lightning rod whole showdown masked vs unmasked. 

My company sticking mask requirement, still literally belligerent customers *daily* saying don‚Äôt wear masks now, local Facebook groups coming together boycott us mask-required. Hopefully won‚Äôt much don‚Äôt make it.

It‚Äôs easy think. alarmist. reasons concern, even may sufficient keep current mandates place. 

Some areas, live, good compliance mask mandates stores public areas. means antivaxxers spreading virus much might.  provided protection can't get vaccine yet opportunity.  


Removing mandates also took away public pressure created promises relaxed masking vaccination numbers high enough. doubt much antivaxxers continue follow rules one tell they've vaccinated not.  


Personally, would preferred weeks notice, hopes would push people fence vaccinated column. 2nd link article: Looks like potassium manganate (VII) lot people don‚Äôt get Flu vaccines begin with. it‚Äôs ‚Äúanti-vaxxers‚Äù either, time people don‚Äôt bother it. it‚Äôs political. right there, head exploded. Hahaha blatantly false. expecting Memorial Day, happy! Might well drop gonna take like month people adjust idea. Dad lives Ohio said 90% people still wearing masks Costco went optional. Masks protect lot things besides coronavirus. allergies year, tend catch whatever flu going around even get annual flu vaccination. I'm keeping mask buying more. you. never said impossible. said vaccinated don‚Äôt spread it, exactly cdc saying. 

Maybe‚Ä¶it‚Äôs didn‚Äôt read correctly? Ok people talk anti-vaxxers causing variants created here. ultra variant comes elsewhere doesn‚Äôt matter someone vaxxed not. Mass die offs, world-ending extinction-level event. Clearly. fit narrative subreddit? 

China exporting vaccines world, (not directly India though) including Covax. US hand banned vaccine exports, also restricted exports raw materials needed vaccines point India, CureVac others can't produce enough vaccines. Good ol‚Äô Greg Abbott, announcing good news personally responsible good chunk bad. piece cloth paper face huge burden.

That exactly someone saying wearing mask. me, I'll still wearing mine. Illinois NY dropping Weds safest thing since start take store. Sure sucks, nothing change that. ‚Äútwo weeks‚Äù coming from. Seems arbitrary no? Certainly people vaccinated then, what‚Äôs special 2 weeks? People diligent wearing masks likely getting vaccinated. Everyone wanted vaccine got it, don‚Äôt wear masks people don‚Äôt want wear masks don‚Äôt want vaccine. People lie stuff like probably complying already.

Old/unwashed mask. Improper material. Chinstrap mask. Exposed nose. zero chance dishonest people wear mask way actually effective.


I think OK impose unneeded measures vaccinated people, dishonest people lie. that. CureVac ZyCov-D one OP‚Äôs post. exactly point? 

Do believe vaccinated people safe unmask indoors? 

What think said? would ‚Äúreal‚Äù scientists said?  Sounds like pick choosing it‚Äôs convenient 

Have good drink lad Correct I'm wrong N95 mask protects wearer right? I'm assuming logic wearing home protect infant infection might have, N95 mask help no. misunderstood something, let know haha, concerned. Problem never covid variants infectious, means basic meassures worked nicely last year might low longer cut it. Best way prevent vaccination _before_ huge wave there. people vaccinated stop wearing masks well people can't vaccinated (e.g. people serious medical issues, children, etc.) get sick. Thanks CDC.  vaccination risk minimal. point mask?

Please remember - masks last ditch effort nothing else. Duh burden mine (and be) live summer locked-down people's children. know sucks, burden parent. Anything zero cause people continue wearing masks. moot point make. can't, Arizona one states informed consent. live Midwest parents got vaccinated said vaccinated kids trust vaccine. done. feels like aren‚Äôt great, one straight malicious actions.

You nailed it. Cuomo malicious actions many fronts. You‚Äôre assuming employers aren‚Äôt first ones stripping masks coughing everywhere. many folks want take time. seem
More annoyed folks might still mask annoyed anti vaxers conservatives think pandemic hoax. feels premature. rush take masks could wait weeks people vaccinated? like hurting anyone.  wonder could get without permission. However, I'm adult (so tell me) idea. poverty drives bad nutrition, limited access health fitness activities, bad lifestyle behaviors like smoking drinking. 

Not sure nationalized healthcare solves issues. 1 - Kids get covid suffer short- long-term effects. rarer adults, still problem. 

2 - person getting covid, also people potentially spread to. unvacc kid may mild case, still spread others. Comparing falling deadly disease pretty disgusting ridiculous contradiction comes people like you, shitting anti-maskers year listening science, soon disagrees beliefs it‚Äôs ‚Äúfuck CDC, don‚Äôt know they‚Äôre talking about‚Äù. 

Listen advice, follow science recommendation CDC. insist ignoring CDC recommendations think know better you‚Äôre exactly disregarded cdc recommendations along. lot people believe masks reduce odds getting sick. That's completely different said. Show picture child young receive vaccine also wearing N95 mask. getting turned vaccinated people need wear masks child killers?

It's not, unvaccinated people needing wear masks thus endangering children cannot receive vaccine. Covid could stop nearly car fatalities limiting every car max speed 10 MPH. what‚Äôs important risk-assessment cost-benefit analysis? 

*better safe sorry* I'm second floor technically, I'm travelling time bit slower wife first floor. grossly misinformed. Every adult 18 eligible US several weeks now. recently teens become eligible. Unfortunately I'm Georgia. Region definitely plays part. allowed get 11 year old cancer survivor vaccine I‚Äôd feeling pretty good new rule. country moved honor code I‚Äôm excited it. 

Maybe non-vaccinated people easy identify, non-creepy way? seem annoyed folks might still mask instead annoyed many folks refuse vaccinate first rule politics, business, public health meet people are. Whoo! 

Nintendo NYC E3 reactions incoming! 5 doses?!! vaccinated 5 people one day? benefits getting covid weigh risks getting covid.  287 recorded COVID deaths children 18 United States!

Almost 5 kids week. want one kids statistic. talking whether spread vaccinated people. ignorant person discussing claimed impossible get covid spread vaccinated. need learn ≈£o read. Yeah Fauci wrong this.

The prevailing mentality back masks ineffective people wouldn‚Äôt social distance would touch face. Turns wrong, wrong.

And admitted it. point scientific method isn‚Äôt right every time, it‚Äôs revise stance look data. That‚Äôs people don‚Äôt understand, absence concrete data, scientists make guesses based old data intuition. means get things wrong sometimes. new data rolls show wrong, good scientist revise opinion. that‚Äôs Fauci did. 

It‚Äôs bad didn‚Äôt pour money studying masks virology SARS. have. studies masks prior year old poorly designed. example, many scientists thought cloth masks would make things worse. idea largely based study mid 1900s. also wrong. whole point comment vaccinations general mandatory. Stomp bs that's basically anti-science anti-public health. 

Also, still people can't take covid vaccine various reasons, kids still get severely ill even die, even they're reduced risk. comment vaccines general respect. interesting experiment. Along lines, asked anti-masking, anti-restriction friend somewhat similar question day. argument COVID real, masks/restrictions helpful, argument COVID serious enough warrant restrictions. question was; many people (or %) die (he) would consider COVID (or hypothetical disease/virus) deadly enough warrant restrictions current scale. answer: 5% US population (\~15 million people) single year, growing number cases/deaths.

I personally thought answer insanely high, hey least got number. Seriously. hope person joking. =/= dumb fuck. love WFH.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* personal take somewhat pessimistic. asked last year ok, would flatly said no; people need choose good liberty responsibility so, given choice, enough people would good.

Now, think really deserve liberty. person does, population don't. need herded guided people smarter us possible doctors around stupidly unreasonable 

I wait till willing meet one requests, wait non needle version likely claim expensive well

Think get kick injecting people, slowly might add Feel like folks pissed folks still gonna mask instead angry folks refuse vaccinate Except kid isn‚Äôt. She‚Äôs 5. vax yet. Reddit post claims there's ""no thing"" vaccine that's side-effects show months years later, that's false, top head one vaccine caused narcolepsy line. reason state giving?

If you‚Äôre fully vaccinated you‚Äôre safe. That‚Äôs matters. continue restrict people justification whatsoever wrong. thats individual right (see 1st amendment) think say that.

Also, regards military SPECIFICALLY, many argue founding fathers believed limited scope federal government included national defense. agree intention, able ageee taxpayer money used formation military. debate size scope military, sure. formation military regards would necessary.

And already protect, help provide people, insinuate dont? 

And im taxation principle, im specific taxation. argue programs worth taxes arent.

Literally problem whole thing idea government could force inject something body. clear, im anti-vaccine all, ive gotten vaccines whole life. time, needs individual choice. considered bad idea? lead deaths keeping mask mandates place? think anything unreasonable wearing mask, especially unvaccinated. 1. continue wearing mask. 
2. risk serious illness COVID practically non-existent. Usually it‚Äôs certain words dude, talking precautions general, specifically vaccines. get wearing mask super upsetting you, stop trying make conversation that.

I'll try spell clearly possible: kids immunocompromised still much risk COVID. able get vaccinated (either due health issues fact vaccine approved people age 12), herd immunity yet reached. So, society /u/kickedweasel wants pretend like COVID dealt gone danger anybody anymore, innocent people die good reason. Kids die good reason. Therefore, society wish prevent needless deaths children immunocompromised, can't simply stop caring vaccinations unless herd immunity achieved. 

Again, nobody trying tell wear mask rest life. Hell, nobody's saying personally really anything anymore (as long vaccinated). absolutely keep caring people getting vaccinated, entire point subthread. 0 problems people wanting continue wear masks. don‚Äôt like narratives people attaching decision, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want appear like Republican lulz‚Äù ‚Äúwell vaccine doesn‚Äôt fully protect you‚Äù. narratives start flying began issues. want keep wearing one cause makes feel comfortable, power Looks like they‚Äôre now. make sound like wearing mask hard task 

It least could do. cornerstone masculinity protection herd, herd protector, enforcer. stared plenty people masked up. normalized

Rationalized, sure. Normalized? No, sake it. see folks walking masks, outside, windy day Denver....um, no. ***The problem stagnant inside air.*** CDC says mask vaccinated.

That's issue. anti-vaxx people using policy stop wearing masks around kids. Definitely, laws regulations don‚Äôt violate individual rights.

I think people working healthcare willfully get vaccine. There‚Äôs need force issue. provide sort guidence kids, gave us nothing That‚Äôs good, guy saying doesn‚Äôt like new guidance mother disagrees live currently vaccine available want get it?

I ask many states refusing accept new shipments vaccine returning insufficient demand.

In NY State (where am) get vaccine without appointment many pharmacies grocery stores.

The people know (and know quite few) vaccinated way choosing get vaccinated. many people wearing masks messing facial recognition schemes. That's resorted nationwide microchip implant program. No, serious. Wonderful news. Glad organizations listening CDC guidance. You‚Äôre alarmist all. think it‚Äôs natural reaction. We‚Äôve beaten us wearing mask potential death sentence. one *poof* suddenly it‚Äôs safe? take time people believe it‚Äôs safe woke today feeling sick. Weak, lethargic, chills.... way felt COVID. commenting? you‚Äôll unvaccinated ppl never took seriously freely walking around unmasked now. it‚Äôs piece cloth, harm advising ppl wear little longer. Give businesses municipalities time adjust develop new rules. Give people chance vaccinated protection concerned safety. Make sure 60-70 percent people already vaccinated significant protection opening completely. fairly reasonable especially given businesses local governments heads up. also protects common cold, get back circulation.  people really hate getting sick. 

Also, sneeze, means less spit getting place, I'm going complain about. Again, need constant exposure get disease secondhand smoke. Getting close infected individual enough transmit virus.

Your arguments fair comparison here. Drunk drivers smokers chose themselves. freedom drink smoke. happen kill someone 100% blamed substance, since chose themselves. corona virus doesn‚Äôt care consent not. place blame virus people. Sure people irresponsible engage large gatherings without masks/vaccinations, also people try best stay safe still unwillingly get it.

My uncle died drunk driver. didn‚Äôt blame alcohol man chose drive drinking it. family friend died corona virus. would blame family unknowingly gave instead corona virus itself? family didn‚Äôt choose die get infected virus. Looks like fall gonna see another surge, oh well Dont that. make things difficult employees weird spot. article target, grocery store exclusively. people go target buy groceries. Every grocery store listed free pick groceries can't include people want wear mask inside instead?

It did. last week masks mandated. not, CDC deemed safe vaccinated. need wear masks CDC says safe to? helping? say kids:

1. Leave home. can't, shop online. internet go library.

2. extremely low risk catching virus, especially many people vaccinated.

Every time go kids wearing masks, thats true entire lockdown. seen multiple instances local news frontline workers enforce rules getting abuse customers it. parents right bring kids store important minimum wage employee's right safe abuse?

By way, CA still need wear mask indoors now, grocery store 50/50 masked unmasked. little impact imagine. Weird. Still two days guess, maybe waiting NY confirm? I'd believe guys talking even CT announced theirs. higher numbers used be, higher *proportion* used be.

If used 100 cases, 20 kids, 60 cases, 15 kids, kids higher proportion cases even though dropped number. Kids basically immune covid. think type person anyone worried about. concern ones getting vaccinated choice, infecting ones can't get vaccinated like immuno-compromised/kids/those waiting list. Polyethylene Glycol (PEG) Polysorbate allergies anecdotally people getting active chemo treatments.

this new guidance polysorbate allergy longer contraindication mRNA COVID-19 vaccination, Per CDC guidance, polysorbate allergy longer contraindication mRNA COVID-19 vaccination. People polysorbate allergy contraindicated receive johnson johnson.

There people immunocompromised systems vaccine much--basically, body unable make meaningful antibody response vaccine. dangerous, terribly effective them, sucks. true small number people incorrectly claiming immunocompromised therefore can't get vaccine. they've latched onto word immunocompromised, people immunocompromised inappropriate candidates vaccination. kind people say ""I asthma can't wear mask!"" Kind silly call someone anti maker necessary anymore. listen scientists Doctors instead? dense tho That‚Äôs anxiety speaking. Meijer announced require fully vaccinated individuals. I‚Äôm mobile don‚Äôt know link article tells disingenuous. Surely read proper study masks - see look data statistics understand conclusion masks effective silly (look controls, read discussion) - sharing stuff banned posts deleted mean point. can't read conclusions parrot, that's doubly true we're talking something written journalist. think play it, seems consensus indeed safe take mask vaccinated, part encouraging vaccinations ""why now?"" rather waiting vaccinations changing it.   boss gotten yet this. believes science still go. would focus many children died car crashes last year? I'm pretty sure everyone mostly equal chance dying car crash.

COVID, however, lot fatal elderly. Real Answer: both. Oh boy Hello! tests developed able detect someone susceptible VITT? impact testing thrombocytopenia related issues like HIT? Except say masks help, people shown evidence of. say someone wore mask since March 2020. Good. Glad hear it. shouldn‚Äôt allowed kill others stupidity. Remember blasting CDC director wept worrying face another wave?

Funny seem respect now. Vax'd people stop wearing vax'd people: PARTY!!

See.. that's problem. unvaxed people going ""party"" without masks. Well honest much mask wearing SE KY Nov. ‚ÄúTons‚Äù don‚Äôt know people downvoting you, got reference. is. rushed people collecting unemployment scared basically forced back workforce. Among things. 

Bottom line: keep wearing mask. know long time. That's true. Tons people want get vaccinated wear masks. Japan, people sick wearing masks. Jesus. might argue parents great friend. I'm sorry :( One moth everyone eligible vaccine. Makes perfect sense. Mmm never said illegal, said certainly establishment policies, like banks. Also, they‚Äôd add exemption like many things like hijabs face masks. Many banks sign front telling take hat, don‚Äôt wear jacket hood, take sunglasses, etc. entering. It‚Äôs new practice cultural exceptions. It‚Äôs early tell they‚Äôll add masks list way, doubt though. Here‚Äôs thought, don‚Äôt bring unvaccinated child you. care shoppers aren‚Äôt? You‚Äôre behaving like anti-vaxxed, know

Because see new spikes high antivax areas, almost certain, people likely die. think that's sad. 

And way behaving like antivaxer.   Maybe available area longer month, live, high demand opened general public 4/18. Appointments booked solid first two weeks people waiting turn. live, think fair people feel fully protected work maskless customers. people care live demand low, sure, go maskless everybody own.

The tapering I'm talking based data science projections, ""feeling"". COVID tapering year - spiked January, came down, went back slightly mid-April, came back down. exactly projected happen data scientists. first week June case counts projected get low levels (with mitigations place), reduces risk can't get vaccinated. Right? I‚Äôm fine that. tell need mental health day, I‚Äôll lie HR ask it. Idgaf that. weird said hasn‚Äôt sick year clearly has. get complaints coming peoples office says he‚Äôs sick. he‚Äôs like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm wearing mask you‚Äôre protected‚Äù  Wondering could expect guess 2 3 year old able get it. Hmmm I'm 100% convinced pandemic really yet.

You be, that's provable fact yet. People selfish want things back normal, long got theirs, everyone else get fucked. That‚Äôs‚Ä¶what vaccine for. Good thing continue wear mask regardless advice, preference. wearing mask indoors long time. definitely doesn‚Äôt matter people like not. That‚Äôs point. you‚Äôre vaccinated, fantastic, not, you‚Äôve made choice you‚Äôre own. vaccinated mean? begins wave post covid worrywarts.  really feel bad you. similar treatment. People horrible. Let's hope time next year better jobs least different better people. Hopefully better. get vibe. Hello,

Is safe people get vaccinated Covid-19 factor V Leiden heterozygous MTHr gene? guess I‚Äôm confused. heard news people fully vaccinated caught covid variant India wouldn‚Äôt better wear mask inside ? could happen, well infinite hypothetical scenarios. That‚Äôs meaningful argument. Kids generally really accustomed kinds stuff don‚Äôt necessarily understand. That‚Äôs whole existence early years. NJ resident don‚Äôt sense people issue masks. Doesn‚Äôt seems change much: everything normal beach hanging peoples houses. It‚Äôs warm enough restaurants tons outdoor dining. wear mask go buy hotdogs, don‚Äôt really care. *checks comments* 

Yep, look like sub fond news all. even go far, seeing know portion customers choose outdoor dining safer alternative. Yup went Walmart today DFW, plenty busy. Masks longer required probably 90%+ people still wearing masks. felt nice wearing one (got second shot almost month ago), get feeling odd one something ""wrong"", even though know not. seems risk VIT astrazeneca vaccine likely much higher 1 1 million. security reasons think you‚Äôll see businesses push back. tomorrow probably end year sometime 2021. wasn‚Äôt mass, regular usage masks (at least US) Spanish Flu, think likely change wearing flu season don‚Äôt feel well, similar many Asian countries. effing CDC director said [masks may better wonder people making stupid decisions they're hearing. Garbage in, garbage out. Anyone thinks kids *can't* spread delusional. NJ resident don‚Äôt sense people issue masks. Doesn‚Äôt seems change much: everything normal beach hanging peoples houses.

Why impossible discuss Desantis without sorts actions fans?

We could (and should) discuss Cuomo well, however I‚Äôm sure ‚Äúbut about‚Äù really time place. plus older are, likely vaccinated. also good thing deaths hospitalizations. Think 70%+ ages 65+ vaccinated US. Anyone travelled East Asia pre pandemic would know already pretty common there. would continuation that. made big point don‚Äôt necessarily 100 percent disagree removing mask mandate vaccinated people doesn‚Äôt make sense it‚Äôs impossible stores workers differentiate. 

Every state (and CDC) knows yet lifted mandates anyway. Bullshit, passive aggressive absolutely reason whatsoever. Oh boy. can't wait next wave unvaccinated people getting sick. like optimistic reasonable take. Meanwhile skeptical platforms New Jerseyans freaking like headless chickens panicking masks remain books 2022 something.

Used actually participate guilds eventually pulled realized echo-chambery really were. Still lurk little bit, often. guess JULTAR high risk group Covid. people getting infected Covid extremely dangerous various pre-existing health conditions reasons. like business customer consumed services paid. support universal healthcare* current model absolutely expected outcome.  sure hope so. real world whole time bud least wait % fully vaccinated + 2 week people great majority though.

Even black plague still exists rodent populations around world. signs national parks western United States warn visitors interact mice, chipmunks, ground squirrels, etc. Viruses disappear. part lives now. getting from. Everything I've seen says around 250. fuck downvoted this? missing? pretty substantial portion adults *have* kids. would hope interact kids. Also, kids likely interact kids well. also many adults hold jobs routinely involve interacting children. interactions present avenues transmission. could affect well even directly interact children since may interact do.  step-sister (22) chance get vaccine, chose birthday. Came COVID next week. really sick couldn‚Äôt work. Dumb choice live with. Wish nickel every clickbait claiming cure past year. that's good know! thanks. one scuba diver another, glad hear that! variants already reduce current vaccine efficacy. already studies showing AZ vaccines less effective South Africa variant. speculation. vaccine manufacturers already stated might need tweak formulas future vaccine boosters. course, means effort vaccinate people becomes ongoing, areas challenging. mean numbers doubling due covid... think requires introspection. 

We idea normal acceptable loss, seems one set in.. perhaps 10s millions? think didnt want people wait month get vaccinated. obviously areas matter large amounts country way vaccines people willing get it. move get people vaccinated. go emergency repair 6 months ago, safe/professional, least went. 

I still felt level risk, knew doing. joke here, every spring fall get bout bronchitis puts commission least three days. Nothing since mask mandates. right sure. science says wearing mask protects around getting sick doesn‚Äôt protect catching anything, what‚Äôs point? realize part ""science"" leaving hands governors decide best particular state feel vaccination ratio? CDC said explicitly . LGBT employees get fired reason given, protected lawsuit. dark. People live Kentucky waited six months* remove masks, would still people would say would soon.

Edit: 606 Gawd  Agreed. COVID, we're point science says vaccinated people take masks. Hope helps everyone see good decision, political move single organization. 

The rest dominos fall place soon. issue want motivate reluctant people remaining. 4 teachers work signed news. One biggest complaints coworkers reason get vaccine nothing would change. willing to. Getting people vaccinated goal list reason. legally die off. üëç CDC estimated 35% population infected covid. 47.3% population least 1 shot (and 1 shot protective 2-3 weeks, person 1 shot MUCH closer level protection fully vaxxed person unvaxxed person). assume random distribution vaccines among people infected covid, then:

.473 + .35*(1-.473) = .657, 65.7% people immunity.

If look people 18, 59.7% adults vaccinated:

.597 + .35*(1-.597) = .738 73.8% adults immunity. Actually, vaccinated seeing repeated variant scares amount nothing vaccinated folks, I‚Äôm worried. 
The anti vaxxers take whatever risk want (or heard FB). That's thing politicians, especially re-election. primary *raison d'etre*, else, maintain good public standing shot additional term. I'm sure downvoted, agree you. I'd say early months COVID, important leaders shut borders get clear messaging out.

At point, we've dealing COVID year, people know deal this. moment, main priority government get people vaccinated. could done save lives.

Colorado follows legal doctrine ""employment-at-will"" provides absence contract contrary, neither employer employee required give notice advance notice termination resignation. Additionally, neither employer employee required give reason separation employment. Continental Airlines Inc. v.

Because people going interact people can't get vaccine due medical reasons. think? library requires masks, yours? not, think anywhere else someone may able use computer grocery shopping?

Ours not. cannot think places someone that, especially safely leaving children home alone. comfort, safety. Several employees attacked even murdered. longer makes sense put employees harms way like that.

That's incredibly interesting. I've never seen someone argue masks ENDANGERS people. know, could police military enforce laws instead relying minimum wage workers it. perhaps mask mandate makes less difference imagining number people wearing masks. thats SoCal, still mask mandate.

It make small difference. would make big difference would actually enforcing laws. local target 100% denied people without masks entering, live Tennessee places. Wherever you‚Äôre located, sounds like Target experience norm  concerned freedoms? 5G?

Anyway point really good metrics current levels COVID cases within communities. start rise (which confidently predict won't) guidance always reassessed. present kids already benefiting drastic reduction community transmission brought current vaccination rate (which continues rise).  Canada alone received close 20m doses EU based factories far. They've probably exported 100m doses worldwide. masks protect mainly others, wearer

Lol right. That's see masks patients hospitals, medical workers. /S

Stop spreading false information. Masks one way magical barrier.

I've seen misguided stance parroted many times almost stupid saying condoms protect others, wearer. It'll gone Easter It‚Äôs possible I‚Äôm overly optimistic think thing brings optimism fact approaching election year. way Murphy say need wear masks couple weeks neighboring states without taking much shit. Tbh don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs unreasonable say waiting another 2-4 weeks long clearly defined time frame metric removing restrictions dependent upon. think saying we‚Äôll know see related removing restrictions past made sense think less fluid situation days tying reopening something specific would make people confident risk averse also would drive vaccine rates marginally. possible part CDC's decision massively scale back mask recommendations vaccinated individuals exposure effectively natural 'booster'? understand CA jumped bandwagon, may urban places, enough time get two shots. Best friend husband haunted sign ups, one got 2nd shot today, weekend. high risk.

By June 15, risk good chance post two week since second shot category,. agree 100%

Problem ""follow science‚Ñ¢"" always said breath ""Trust Experts‚Ñ¢"" Oh, always risk mutation makes vaccine less effective.

Because mRNA vaccines target spike protein, extremely unlikely mutation still recognizably SARS-COV-2 also evades vaccine protection ever develop.

""This could happen, take extraordinary steps avoid it"" good way setting public policy. Finally! hear covidophobes cry see nothing really changed care see thousands die flu? ""oh well, gives fuck got mine!""  family member die virus relatives medical frontlines. wear mask inside public shopping areas public transport foreseeable future even though I'm vaccinated.  Actually installed correctly.
Also wrong assume children healthy medical conditions put even risk.

This still personal responsibility issue, control rest population, child. telling parents ok play odds children's well cannot make sure others following rules, almost stupid thinking ok force kid car drunk get school late. 
You large portion people vaccine hesitant anti vaxxer, hold accountability child becomes statistic, country also proved people go great lengths assholes, dangerous times pandemic had: people spitting people, people yanking masks people's faces, people claiming masking children form child abuse, get point right? 

When make conscious decision take child car ride, probably necesity:
45% car rides errands. 

So put child car, take precautions steps make sure child safe, get good child seat, make sure installed correctly place part vehicle manufacturer recommends type restraint. also make sure drive car unsafe. also drive speed limit obey traffic laws. happens that, hands made sure kept part.

Now onto stupid argument flawed people read risk factors:

Per CDC:
Of children died crash:
In 2017, 49% 8-12 year olds buckled up, compared 36% 4-7 year olds 22% children less 4 years old (with known restraint use).

45% black 46% Hispanic children buckled up, compared 26% white children (2009-2010; aged 12 under).

From 2001 2010, approximately 1 5 child passenger (&lt;15 years old) deaths U.S. involved alcohol impaired driving (BAC ‚â• 0.08 g/dl); 65% time, child‚Äôs driver drinking. 

Most child passengers (&lt;15 years old) drunk drivers (61%) buckled fatal crash.

Restraint use among young children often depends upon driver‚Äôs seat belt use. Almost 40% children riding unbelted drivers also unrestrained.

Child restraint systems often used incorrectly. estimated 46% car seats booster seats (59% car seats 20% booster seats) misused way could reduce effectiveness.

That laws, enforce them. also educate public procedures ensure safety.
There laws prevent unvaccinated people keep masks on, absolutely accountability.

Other countries least fined people, provided population medical grade masks. country cares cash optics. Business easily (and legally) ask proof vaccination check it‚Äôs forged not. Many already vaccinations, covid. know neighbors care you, act like do? everyone access internet.

If however, fit one categories, might know properly vet source credible not. Lots good well-founded articles online, many, bad unfounded articles. I'm Denver, pretty progressive city, know lot people getting vaxxed. vaccinated still wearing mask. Well true statewide mandate cities/counties made own. Where's shit? problem store policies wearing mask matter vaccinated idiots understand this.  mask forever

Ah yes, strawman original definitely spouted constantly sub /s

The facts are, people continuing get vaccinated cases deaths continuing go down. we're end. Like said, respect CDC, made announcement June probably bone pick it. think May little early.  lying unvaccinated people go maskless, will

 1) infect cannot vaccinated (children, immunocompromised, cancer patients)

 2) raise rate breakthrough infections

 3) increase probability new variants. behavior existential example ‚Äòmoral hazard‚Äô. observe within CDC knocks park  best incentive avoiding death vaccinated, haven‚Äôt heard breakthrough cases severe. lot us would rather risk minor illness wear mask everywhere

""BUt StIlL SpReAd IT!!!!""

""BuT LoNG CoVID!?!?!""

Ask people proof either things, can't give it. Fear replacement science data, COVID no, say fully vaccinated still wears masks. People ability fuck nature‚Äôs resources children least affected virus... also CDC already approving children...

who fuck able vaccinated point beyond people already worry normal flue risks? 

a lot people get flue shot fuck political beliefs. Glad endemic finally ‚Äúover‚Äù. lol love actually thinking, caring person site called troll. really shows depravity corner deep web. Nobody. expected quarantine get COVID-19. Polis Colorado basically said pandemic kids recover get sick nothing left worry about. forgetting can't spread disease vaccinated. I‚Äôm California, super old, received first dose April 15th (the first day eligible). still 1 week go I‚Äôm 2 weeks post second dose. weekend went park kids‚Ä¶. single parent wearing mask! EVERY parent essential worker? Ha! future infections lead mutations?

This absolutely part it, virus floating around likely get unlucky resistant strain.

Another part people can't vaccinated yet/at all. another part want people die want try provide Healthcare bunch people get sick.  I'm glad experts tell us stuff literally doctors, gross? Yikes. like Twitter. they've done right things. That's incredible Wait find international travel works far details final, far know. Last read, vaccination negative PCR within 72 hours older positive result iirc. Keep eye France page US State Department travel advisories Embassy France US. saying? mask policy says vaccinated take mask. way determining someone vaccinated. Before, even anti maskers forced wear masks inside businesses. able wear masks whether weren‚Äôt vaccinated. don‚Äôt understand.  family parents spent full weekend together even went dinner first time since January 2020. followed everything, none us got covid, live normal life. American checking in, trust government GE worth 380 billion. worth almost nothing poor management. argument investment companies buy means nothing, since buy every company existence.

&amp;#x200B;

Do know happens company sells assets? business anymore. sold disneyworld rights mickey etc, would opthing sell anymore would gone. need understand difference liquid asset illiquid. compare normal perosn, suppose house worth half million cash. sell house get cash, might take year house.

&amp;#x200B;

The last 4 quarters, 3 lost money. puny profit last quarter means nothing. Like said, like bragging making minimum wage. Sure, raren't losing money, getting nowhere. could something improve income, would. did. I'll bet disneyworld customers 100% capacity 25%.

&amp;#x200B;

They risk bankruptcy now, continued make puny profit shareholders would riot heads would roll contunied pace they'd go 4-5 years. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also, plenty fortune 500 companies go bankrupt. Hertz, JC PENNEY, Neiman Marcus, Brooks brothers, Frontier communications went bankrupt last year. Yeah like 120% available doses lol there‚Äôs way done recently Yup. Canada too. super strict mask rules, yet we‚Äôve fair share bad outbreaks despite lockdown 300 days past year Toronto.  sure experts outside observers even Americans acknowledging people either lie care it? die, sounds like Darwin awards me. know trolling Reddit, nobody remembers name 5 seconds reading post. People lie need dog come restaurant them. absolutely lie this. want public going creating N95 mask shortage crucial healthcare workers.

There N95 shortage last March. shortage ended last fall CDC still tells people buy N95 masks even though warehouses full N95s companies able sell hospitals want spend money them. No. not. adults it, kids don't. Lying status different losing privileges vaccinated. I'd suppose situation dictate someone willing lie it.  correct need determine who's company in. wrong reason. reason care.

When got shot particular questions asked getting vaccine get vaccine ever allergic reactions certain things,including certain vaccines vaccine components. know someone reactions vaccines. I'm person was, would get covid vaccine doctor suggests get covid vaccine. doctor suggests get vaccine. Again, sure, tht one person millions, still person know. 

If little kids died covid, correct risk. have. risk. Albeit small risk. Nearly 300 US, Last recall. Sure chances rare. saying risk, stop lying. 

Even link link categories people receive vaccine.

All I'm saying care people done part continue to. I'm vaccinated. measles smallpox mean would happy surround people chance contracting disease. SC? I‚Äôm looking avoid types places. comment completely ignores social behavior. Humans extremely social impressionable creatures. indoor public places go ""mostly masked"" ""mostly unmasked"", encourage lot unvaccinated people go unmasked--because that's following crowd. Well they're fairly unique situation. unfortunate ? you‚Äôre able properly social distance, person you‚Äôre wearing mask. And, best able, keeping 6 feet away. It‚Äôs pretty clear cut. 

And let‚Äôs real, people weren‚Äôt catching COVID walking past another masked individual grocery store. catching ignoring mask social distancing recommendations. count 1 hand number people know careful still got sick. That's cool dude. want, judgment.

 I'm going wear mask anywhere required. Fully vaxxed loving life right now. Lol I've seen reported, interestingly I'm 40, let alone 50 (no underlying issues either) got text NHS second jab would offered earlier too. Perhaps actually overall shift towards second doses?

Or maybe varies region, ahead others. got first jab couple weeks ago nationally opened 40's knows! lol ok Lol ‚Äúit‚Äôs fine‚Äù It‚Äôs disease. It‚Äôs virus. 200 viruses contract. That‚Äôs part life. majority ppl get Covid barely symptoms yet ppl acting like it‚Äôs Black Plague Fauci recommendation stupid **MASSACHUSETTS UPDATE**

**Fully vaccinated estimates**

Using date 95% adults dose 1, get second dose 31 days later (1 month Moderna), plus additional 14 days immunity kick in, put us date of: Tuesday, August 24th, 95% adults fully vaccinated.

Notes: 

* Population uses 2020 estimates, such, percentages slightly lag CDC data, however, percentages take account entire herd, higher 2020 population compared 2019's used CDC. Also note 12+ number available 2019 population values. Fair enough. agree. like rule CDC well. care lot New Zealand health authorities say COVID point CDC says. question data say risk children? know non-zero fit relative risks? need protect that's do. That's saying vaxxed transmit, saying vaxxed likely reduced transmission rates. transmitting all. Doesn‚Äôt take expert know today‚Äôs human race tell truth.    .... Florida, vaccine passports banned.

Everywhere else *does* way this. Yep best friend gone, car time generally lazy it. works Trader Joe's heard people going masking, went got first shot. questioned non-scientists? That‚Äôs partly got mess begin with. I‚Äôm qualified question scientists fully comprehend answers. 

But redditors saying you‚Äôre vaccinated longer consider threat... that‚Äôs questionable. point simple ""Just wear N95 social distance worried it"", person responding saying. You‚Äôre right! meant boggles mind people okay wearing mask forever. I‚Äôm pro mask. I‚Äôve pro mask entire time. continue wear mask I‚Äôm sick future. don‚Äôt want future everyone wears masks every context. get vaccinated, don‚Äôt to! type person lie vaccinated likely never get vaccinated. mask forever protect people themselves? Well never feel fully understand people get worked others wanting get vaccine. I'm vaccinated, someone want vaccine that's literally none business. one forced vaccine me, made choice get it. 

Can someone explain we're pushing hard everyone get it? future infections lead mutations? understand everyone wants everyone else get vaccinated. Genuine question...  Let anti vaxers reap consequences stupidity.  bunch dead people unfortunately dead kids stop bull crap kind I'm feeling right now. fair force child wear mask don't. could good long time little kids get vaccinated. Honestly, choose get vaccinated, means lie it. Go ahead get sick rest us care people around us fine. Hopefully end miserably sick while, put ventilator, not, perish thought, dying learn ignorance disregard. may ideal, everyone wants vaccine gets it‚Äôs damn fault putting risk. ""People safe virus safe virus..."" thanks info bud... Teenagers know people lie. Children know. seen past year people give shit pandemic. feels like it‚Äôs still early dropping masks inside stores

Based data intuition? head CDC emphasized today vaccinated risk need wear mask.  biggest issue ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù issue actions impacting others. It‚Äôs tough line walk situations like wearing mask isn‚Äôt accepting risk it‚Äôs creating risk others around may ok accepting. 

Hopefully avoid n95 makes become widely available better yet reusable n95s don‚Äôt want mask others don‚Äôt want exposed potential risk option via n95 masks without absurdly high cost.

I‚Äôm arguing mask mandates it‚Äôs simple making choice effects vaccinated care We're page then. point then? people go work?  percentage real hardcore anti-maskers pretty small. there's much larger cohort people wore mask would prefer change made anymore, that's people pushing back hard it. kids 12 :( Makes sense me. Vaccination higher-risk masking. people find risks vaccination worth rewards, someone like probably considers risk high whatever reason. There's reason would necessarily translate anti-mask well. get sick vaccinated people don‚Äôt. we‚Äôve gotten actual culling herd. Many caught last year take seriously.

So they‚Äôre good go antibodies least  I'm literally arguing continuing mask mandate. Sounds like agree me. dude 40M fucking kidding me. better chance getting people take smart precautions save lives absurd exaggerations. No.Shit. think restaurant workers last year vaccines out?

There option point, either work take risk work. 

Now options, employee can't get vaccinated moved less frontline position (say making coffee) vaccinated employee moved customer interfacing position. Latest studies say much less likely, don‚Äôt say impossible. Vaccinated appear generally lower viral loads.

That said, widow cancer patient, chemo too? sister immune compromised, possibly severely depending drugs they‚Äôre using. me, assuming doesn‚Äôt live you, I‚Äôd still mask good quality masks (kn95 even n95) around her, make safe enough go unmasked otherwise. It‚Äôs safest, sake. lives you, though, I‚Äôd continue mask public. make sure she‚Äôs got best masks get hands on.

All best beat fucking cancer, best rest family helping her! I'm talking following guidelines. admitted everyone social distance. literally entire point. hell even saying? Two coworkers without hesitation said would lie. One says dont want get alzheimers taking it. kind makes sad see kinda shit. ofc will. ppl want remove mask let's integrity hear ya. got first dose Pfizer second day available. nervous all. time due second dose heard enough stories people high fevers chills full body aches almost chickened out. went it, reminding vaccines way back normalcy. spent whole day convincing everything felt side effect. Thankfully, end sore arm bit headache. talking lot people, seems like even feel really crummy, fairly short lived. Better go get vaccinated case people lie then. Might recommend Betterhelp.com theyre likely die car crash way get shot die covid fully agree I'm fully vaccinated, amount anti-vax people live I'd feel comfortable wearing mask still I'd feel wearing mask wear one long. local businesses still require masks. vaccine available anyone 12 adults.

Why waiting vaccine?

And completely ignoring point call anti-maskers already wearing them. already best kill you, represent change front. suppose that's true. feel like odd woman  Yeah true. here. Mask wearing 0 outdoors me. largely talking social media said true, social media great way spread misinformation. think large scale, things improving terms returning normal misinformation fear every platform stop thing is, good portion people good people spend time around good honest. lie getting vaccinated, get vaccinated. one. Every study read says vaccines work. wear mask, won't. surely understand CDC making recommendation save lives overall. children chronic lung disease. Hope made form sense, I'm best putting things words. coworker said yesterday, mfs got one joke know people going lie. much else keep country shut forever people going get shot.

We ability think safe. might go sporting event concert anytime soon. personally think pretty safe vaccine. I'm less 4 days done got second shot 8th. People want still allowed wear masks people want to. inside anywhere except house since rules changed probably week two anyway.

If got vaccine concerned catching covid grocery store wear mask. still concerned groceries delivered. forced think risky activities part. Even essential workers safer vaccine wearing mask pretty much last year.

I think number people wearing masks increase pretty soon. lot people like technically fully vaccinated probably drop masks are. area least one dose vaccine fault. easy get everyone 12 now. act like opening gyms good public health. Vaccines far effective masks, especially gym  really sound like badass. I‚Äôm impressed you. Lol. Thanks - fixed  People always lie literally everything even smallest things noone cares about. People suck thats way is. least ""open everything!"" makes sense

Well, agree that--especially several months ago, averaged thousand deaths day nowhere near half Americans vaccinated. people already making comments then. think point wearing mask *easiest* mitigation method, right? agree with. hard wear cloth face.  Well, DUH!

I politely request anyone wishing come closer six feet wear mask REGARDLESS least next six months, EXACTLY reason.

Not people strong tendency scum, large busily active pro-scumminess political party country. Med Tech myself, validate statement. you‚Äôre pretty good shape two weeks first Never underestimate power stupidity people late party, that's all. many people mistake critical thinking thinking. FTFY None, really need government force hand that? people don‚Äôt live social media bubble base life decisions social media comments. I‚Äôve seen 50% drop mask use outdoors area near universal month ago. result vaccinations. Pretty soon, lot people going get serious FOMO relent real-life peer pressure way powerful caring idiots social media say.  continue shout rooftops: safe equal risk free. fact people trying redefine meaning ‚Äúsafe‚Äù makes blood boil. person you‚Äôre wearing mask

Yeah shit. That's literally exact point I'm trying make. get? They're low risk guess considered big deal kids likely die car crash drown pool Covid majority black folks I‚Äôve spoken mom half white native (but like...culturally native). mom got immediately told wouldn‚Äôt see without mask. 

Frankly black science denial thing it‚Äôs frustrating hearing media trot Tuskegee endlessly this, reinforcing ingrained scientific illiteracy population. 

Like no, choose get vaccinated historical precedence sympathy worldview. society humor belief specter government interference *after* shot goes arm. Oh give rest **tldr: virus around much risk, people need get vaccinated help stop spreading.**


Yes, part longer circulates likely could mutate put us back square one.

The main one though probably ""herd immunity"" 

Some people conditions mean they're unable get vaccine rely people getting vaccine stay safe.

There also people immunocompromised can't fight virus well non-immunocompromised people, may lead think people need get vaccine since vaccine 95% effective theyll probably fine, also probably not.  funny part: liars putting risk, who‚Äôve vaccinated.

The funny part; they‚Äôre also putting people risk can‚Äôt get vaccine legitimate reasons like compromised immune systems, like niece I'm saying get rid mask mandates, vaccinated people ditching masks. incredibly obvious.   cares? vaccinated protected, regardless whether someone else vaccinated.   waiting vaccine feels like ""We tripled chance get infected Anti-Masker, need thank us""  Yeah shit, locking children isolation year that. wear mask anti-science. CDC said choose want importantly  required everyone mass transit  guidance says fully vaccinated discard masks *most* settings. wear bicycle helmet beach, would you? probably wear one actual bicycle. Everyone life (friends, spouse, family) claiming trust CDC still wear masks. I'm frustrated feel like I'm one excited fully vaxxed person. expert. Everyone lies.   people outside US‚Ä¶. Americans still wear masks. people don‚Äôt right generally avoided anyways. believe prelude providing proof vaccinated. school systems already provide documentation dr child appropriate immunizations according age. baby hospital US also ‚Äúup date‚Äù valid insurance. extended circumstances though.

So... wear mask protect others, lesser extent, fully protected. point comment? switched President denied pandemic nonetheless hoarded vaccines President promoted masks entire campaign day 0 presidency abolishing mask mandates effectively night.

Biden abolish mask mandates, CDC did. appropriate government agency making decisions. Yup going fucking disaster That‚Äôs stance too.

Alternatively, really even care, vaccinated. director CDC said we're really asking settings, say, terms honor system, people honest themselves,"" Walensky said. ""You're protected vaccinated, vaccinated."" Sooo, STD diagnosed spend it?  would also ignore doctor's notes exceptions. 


They automated points tracker. got allowed amount let go, even OMs said get points whatever. 


They enforce policy supervisors, every time one lazy ones called out, previous supe take shift, work double (salary pay), go home, sleep hours, come back scheduled shift. 


The reason got laid OM let fire guy shown 3 weeks, automated stats still recording totals 0, bringing average down. 


They laid another supe similar way, ch aging team give difficult folks ""mentor"", hand teams good. team also low stats basically training team. 


Place shit show I'm glad keep getting sued.  I‚Äôm liar say everyone lies. OSHA hasn‚Äôt updated rules imagine companies waiting happens Yes, they're going issuing advice masks since they've using public transport ages.  Non-experts also say they‚Äôll lie. White American checking in, also trust government feel ya. lot family Canada. They're rough time still. fair people comfortable vaccines healthy people feel like need it, obese ones. They're literally giving free burgers donuts people get vaccines.. doesn‚Äôt mean 30% chance getting it. chance getting barely different Moderna Pfizer...and it‚Äôll symptoms mild. Wear mask want, you‚Äôre safe. lie? Get vaccinated don‚Äôt worry them. excuses plenty appointments across US.  Yes. Especially non-scientist. Academic communities vulnerable bubbles tunnel vision. academics advance society, interact society. lie. die. good luck next fall/ winter. know people personally already lying. legit vaccination cards show they‚Äôre vaccinated even though they‚Äôre not. It‚Äôs fucked locked people months end breaks would lead lot problems people regardless age. surprising kids, especially parents stressed out. good feeling far away. They've testing 12 since March think powers want vaccinated kids next school year. made first appointment available 15 year old within 30 minute drive tomorrow. state, feel like pfizer well spread out. Finally found pharmacy.

I think still lot want vaccine change. Get vaccinated, follow CDC guidance, abandon mask usage prove point vaccines effective. It'll change overnight. one's wants bad publicity outbreak business.

Hopefully ok post here. I‚Äôve wondering long quarantine symptoms test negative?

I‚Äôve fully vaccinated since January antibody blood tests confirm antibodies vaccine I‚Äôm sure even COVID. sore throat starting Friday night, chills, body aches, fatigue, low-grade fever Saturday night. I‚Äôm sure got this. past week, I‚Äôve grocery shopped seen 2 vaccinated friends weren‚Äôt showing signs sick. RAPID test took Saturday came back negative, PCR test today reading RAPID test isn‚Äôt accurate needs virus sample. I‚Äôm planning quarantining get PCR test results, wondering ends-up negative. CDC guidelines flu say quarantine least 24 hours fever gone, seems little short considering covid quarantine 10 days. I‚Äôm (maybe irrationally) concerned COVID, vaccine cause test false negative. appreciate thoughts people might have. I'm supposed go work Friday, I've trying figure call off. people can't vaccinated legitimate medical reasons. everyone knows Venn diagram, gets joke across without link Wikipedia explain Euler diagram is. Nah I'm good. saw people maskless close proximity first time weekend since March 2020 people fully vaxxed. I'm waiting anymore Love Darwensime!   They've lied us past 2 years, turn? Fact is, care Liars. die, die. Vax, reasonably certain Vax busting mutants yet, causes harm let stupid are. one thing. comparing 2 states really comparable. mean California almost twice many people living Florida completely different mindset... Also Florida tourist trap. surprising one traveling Florida experienced less illness. Nurses believe science nurses. True except won‚Äôt pretend they‚Äôre unrelated issues, blame ¬´¬†vaccine shedding¬†¬ª negative effects I'm sorry Dad got Covid, I'm glad recovered quickly. impressive, also reassuring effectiveness vaccines, thanks! CDC given much inconsistent information whole pandemic it‚Äôs insane *anyone* trusts them. every one thing get right also get one thing horribly wrong. unvaccinated people get Covid likely fine. aren‚Äôt fine screw them. know I‚Äôm vaccinated I‚Äôm wearing mask anymore unless store specifically requires it. CDC working way allow vaccination.. one reasons last line unlikely negative side effects catching it. health issues take precautions 2019..... 

Again make mandatory diseases X age unless going foreign country. Remember told Anti-maskers follow science? Yeah maybe let‚Äôs keep following science. Time practice preach wont. guidelines still state work requires wear mask wear it. Get vaccinated deal consequences. Easy enough choice.   Shutting schools school nexus point spread virus. Anyone who's ever school knows parents kids school knows perfectly well schools like bus station disease. One kid brings something in, spreads kids there, bring home families, bring work them, spread around there. disgusting lack sick day laws US make much worse, many people can't take time get sick, even unpaid. Jobs call absence fire trying keep people getting sick.

The things goes shutting churches, bars, every place groups people meet interact.  And? you‚Äôre vaccinated care? Went Trader Joe‚Äôs today California person without mask. Definitely got dirty looks  I'll assume serious rude. Responding article reaction ""this they're doctors,"" least, implies nurses stupid understand scientific results CDC made recommendations. gross. People making doctors versus nurses need be. much experts paid, could make bucks also think Michigan mini surge proved vaccines working We're talking accepting risks here. Death worse disease vs car crash - dead.

More kids die car accidents covid. regulate much possible, since would include far lower speed limits, meaning society (and would argue every parent who's thread talking risks kids) accepts number deaths occur car accidents. Why, then, lower amount deaths something that's unacceptable? 

And honestly, top that, where's evidence even going increase deaths kids? ton states mask mandates months - cases still dropping like everywhere US.   Went full capacity soccer game yesterday lot people know vigilant mask wearing weren‚Äôt wearing theirs

Military reports 23 new COVID-19 cases border county Cheorwon true before, too. think bad people refused wear mask, still believe antisocial behavior best discourage.

For example: Imagine someone wore mask everywhere pandemic. immunocompromised sick anything, massive germaphobe. Well, people would generally look much crazy germaphobe. I'd like attitude apply towards people now. mega site NJ went 13 year old Friday, people saw parents adolescents. intake nurse said 95% appointment young teenagers. beautiful thing behold.

Exactly feel. I'll wear one work business asks to. outside around people small group settings golden. Like park today friends maskless talking trust CDC. Like wearing mask???? I‚Äôd rather everyone told truth situation individuals allowed make decisions make sense risk assessment.

It would lot frustrating CDC mislead public try control behavior. 

We know vaccinated people protected infection generally spread virus. CDC lie everyone try get people continue wearing masks??

The science came reported results: ‚ÄúIt safe vaccinated people stop wearing masks settings‚Äù.

If said anything else would editorializing opinion lower confidence guidance. Especially 90% people wear cloth masks. Everyone also worried children sent school cloth masks. WOW. take expert know people screaming virus political hoax going get vaccine one checking. WOW. Kids 12 cannot vaccinated. Also, people can‚Äôt vaccines due health issues. That‚Äôs one reasons immunity vaccines important.  Fleeced? one fleeced here. agreed pay x dollars service. service provided. given $3,200 gift, unexpectedly. even talking about?  Ok, I'll plan calling first thing morning.

You yell don't, lol. (Nervous laugh.) Maybe identify ones haven‚Äôt taken it? Maybe like star something chest... wait Oh no, wish simple, willing pay money fake card spend even money store refusing service. purchasing ability spend money. guys think gonna happen stores keeping masks? need release statement saying they‚Äôre keeping masks something say they‚Äôre dropping officially. Regardless do, someone gonna pissed people vaccinated still able test positive covid even either symptomatic asymptomatic. So... got vaccinated, caught covid... still spread covid, even though got vaccine. That‚Äôs point, point government gave businesses states free pass try enforce mask wearing puts *everyone* danger.

Irrelevant. Businesses private property. rules want violate protected taking kids store grocery shopping people actually masks on. changes dont know shot. singles people cant get shot.

So keep masks fuckinhg mask, people act like oppressed rights taken them.

They literally need wear vaccinated. CDC guidance merely late acknowledgement already established science. 

Your kids vaccinated need wear good maks stay home. Full stop. rights end start infringe mine. care think ""a fucking first responders like shaking heads feel hopeless fellow Americans selfish.

We're nowhere near vaccination rate knowledge disease would seriously make anyone understanding situation mask bar. frankly someone concerned keep children away, us know risks percentages don‚Äôt to.

Car accidents swimming pools kill children annually Covid since start pandemic United States per CDC.  Yeah bet life savings two, I‚Äôm people lie. There's interesting showdown state Florida, governor says business operating state require proof vaccination. However, NCL wants cruise line 100% vaccinated. Plus, way CDC outlined cruise lines get back operating fastest way require least 95% customers vaccinated. 

I'm sure happen showdown. governor says budge care cruise line leaves state. cruise line says leave can't require proof vaccination. think sides lose NCL leaves NCL would require money build ports state would lose large portion economic benefits part cruise industry.

I'm sure blink first. it‚Äôs experts it‚Äôs absolute idiots tell u people lie It‚Äôs safe bet people lie vaccination status point don‚Äôt care. got shots, family got shots, friends got theirs.

It‚Äôs risk always present‚Ä¶but didn‚Äôt necessarily need dominate way life.

COVID even less threat children. sympathize parents worrying kids‚Äô exposure, don‚Äôt think risk assessment calculated correctly many.  funniest thing ever heard they‚Äôre main demographic anti-maskers/anti-science conspiracists. It‚Äôs also heavily influenced education region, want focus age race, that‚Äôs still unfortunately. Hilarious attempt. Good wearing masks social distancing vaccinated. assume anti-vaxxers, then, 'vaccine reluctant' vaccine.

Hopefully fall they'll feel encouraged enough give shot (pun intended). Doesn‚Äôt data show children age range extremely low risk anyway? think it‚Äôs symptom able trust media general. people won‚Äôt beleive truth even told truth.  sads racism still widespread debilitating Murrica. Work harder eliminate it.  great there. Awesome experience. 

I fully vaccinated FYI. brother law vaccinated. Still got coronavirus died. Stay safe people. get limited immunity first dose. booster prolongs upto 6 months now! ""You LIE,you DIE""  new slogan convince people wear masks unless fully vaccinated.  there‚Äôs virtually zero risk running biking outside Lol shit  Nearly done second dose (tomorrow Tuesday) I'll still wear mask foreseeable future.

I get sick year cold, flu, 'innocuous' illness causes people miss work. People lying Covid....why would stop lying now? best peer-reviewed study believe CDC cited multiple times.  chances getting vaccinated low. extremely unlucky also small chance spreading it. shit. hope normalized masks sick anything us wrong. We're tired pandemic, literally care anything makes sense point. LOL case unvaccinated trying pass vaccinated. everybody

but President Joe already said needed said government checking in. Dont trust government! Why? fully vaccinated CDC told risk transmit contract symptomatic COVID. never caught everyone‚Äôs masks benefit others. yes, supposed care them. Gotta take high road. Bless hearts, something like that. OK, let's put way. vaccines work? actually trusting science. everyone else trusting science aligns beliefs. Source?

Scientific American estimates 600 deaths 2020-2021 flu season, vs. 22,000 34,000 deaths two years Til wales get COVID lie, like politicians expert know this.  Lmaoooo last veiled racism line. Considering it‚Äôs mostly republicans getting vaccinated concur. You‚Äôve already got nearly full immunity, much have. you‚Äôve got enough get infected COVID, won‚Äôt hit hard. needs thread .. wait wha? wow! Epic ad hominem good gentlesir! dropped slower rate previously dropping at. Indicating something increasing numbers somewhere...the mask mandate removal directly correlates time frame. 

We ridiculously high numbers time last year. Comparing places different levels restrictions, enforcement restrictions, population density, age demographics, ethnic demographics, etc. something I've done previously I'm going start now. Sorry. 

Nothing else correlates plateau subsequent increases metrics we've seen well mask mandate removal.

Anecdotally, saw noticeable difference people stopped wearing masks mandate. People previously, begrudgingly, worn jacking onto faces anymore. People hold end societal bargain, will, reason needed stop. 

Compliance local area went 90% area roughly 60-80 given day. 

I seen anything else would cause downward trend virtually stop, hospitalizations creep back upslightly. you? think random, seasonal, or? 

I'm honestly willing entertain options, seen would impact time period. closest I've got sports venues, and/or children's sports, that's insanely hard track across region. noted significant portion uptick New Hampshire. lot data probably right, clearly wrong. Even hypothetically right, one time non-repeatable boost doses see again.

Adjusting NH dump, 18+ average down.   hope, booster program us vaccinated.

I want normal life, I‚Äôm continuing wear mask despite vaccinated.

I dont want looked like asshole. Vaccines available 12+. Children 12 substantial risk adverse outcome. Influenza poses risk mandate masks shutdown society it. 

Research conducted meantime potentially extend them. said, environments schools, believe masks slated enforced. 

If concerned environments, selective send children. Israel 1 new case today. 1 Don‚Äôt falling getting high horse personally think they‚Äôve dropped mask requirement get fence sitters get vaccine.

Oh, think too--it's I'm frankly skeptical headline article. work? think so, I'm skeptical. think could ways incentivize getting vaccinated.  in, water wet! mean what? don‚Äôt want get vaccine freely available right don‚Äôt want wear mask, mandate avoid COVID? people don‚Äôt care whether catch virus we? Good luck ! May spirit stay strong side effects mild. nervous get shots too, tried remind experience temporary fever and/or chills, meant body responding vaccine job. ended feeling little tired day 2nd Pfizer shot, made sure keep moving arm stay hydrated shot. it‚Äôs required vaccinated Covid what‚Äôs point? trust fully  really thought removal mask mandates would huge milestone everyone would excited about. lot ‚Äútrust science‚Äù people know apparently epidemiologists sudden swear CDC wrong now. Hopefully conversation different June. compared vaccinated? Stay classy CDC. people get them, unfortunately. Oh good! Glad you‚Äôre already turning corner. We‚Äôve focused covid last year feel like forgot theres things get us sick. Hopefully cold!  Fauci sure lot things say lot things cares? Let die. fault point, anyone wants get vaccinated can. People high risk getting vaccinated months. went high risk lower risk, least I'm from. 15 days first shot mRNA vaccine puts people substantial protection. Rapid immunity saves day. selfish.

Under normal circumstances, everybody selfish. Dont pretend like care anyone outside friends family.  would alright checked people's vaccination status. ""can't"" happen here, despite face pry others' lives countless ways. instead, know people going lie vaccinated, let happen. There's way best anyone capable of.  everywhere. wanted J J get back life faster find it, Pfizer shot walk in. Square one? Unlikely. something infect make sick? Possible. mutant completely avoids vaccine protection virulent dangerous sarscov2 entirely immunonaive population highly unlikely. likely mutant infect, produces milder infection. Still better everyone gets vaccinated lowers odds, realistically, likely see levels mortality saw. Experts Lie!!! *surprised Pikachu face  Thanks! kind leaning toward well. fever broke morning, I've feeling better sleeping whole day. I'll keep work Friday table PCR negative symptoms stop then. see somebody public building without mask, assured unvaccinated. even understand irony. choice have? you‚Äôre vaccinated, you‚Äôre basically risk. Many people refuse, can‚Äôt get vaccine. point, think goes. long keep wringing hands *something* great News Cycle continue. Chicago everyone pretty good masking. Since this, outdoors 0 masks. Indoors, noticed lot back room staff wearing masks, servers still probably long. think vast majority us simply accepted risk disease. pandemic.

But agree: wanna wear mask, Whatever day people decide take masks, every excuse still apply. Whenever COVID still there, still POSSIBLE get infected even vaccinated, still POSSIBLE spread others, still POSSIBLE COVID could mutate new variant, still people aren‚Äôt able get vaccinated, vaccine forever 100% effective. argument could/will change cases high comfort. whatever number comfortable probably completely arbitrary based science whatsoever (or 0 impossible). can‚Äôt wear mask? I‚Äôm fully vaccinated continue wear one large crowds whenever I‚Äôm sick. vaccinated person choosing wear mask isn‚Äôt unvaccinated person choosing to. 

Ones choice kills people, one doesn‚Äôt. live, everyone wore mask. could probably count hand number people weren‚Äôt. also work different state it‚Äôs same. Threenagers thing. stop others spreading virus.

If understand correctly body already antibodies. good virus injected? fuck people got vaccine early possible time fully take affect yet? problem vaccinated people masking. problem getting rid mandates quickly.  taken Russian shot recently tested immune response, ""which showed high antibodies.""
""Same results everyone know ‚Äî immediate friends family,"" added. ""Sputnik excellent vaccine serious side effects associated administration.""

If doc advises wait, I‚Äôd suggest mask n95. Frankly, since minimum 2 weeks safe level immunity (J&amp;J) 5-6 weeks Pfizer/Moderna, may want go high quality masks anyway. Anecdotes complaint people mean Russia nothing EMA received full clinical data. Czech submission missing basic parts. manufacturing scale. lack cooperation Brazil complaining of. acted like good enough need mask mandate anymore. logic, never needed one. Look obviously live state perhaps never mandate critical enough mass anti-maskers could get away ignoring mandates. parts country, mandates staunchly place enforced, anti-maskers submissive minority position end wearing disgruntedly otherwise get stare-shamed death and/or literally kicked businesses. live place like that. Haha media wants us maks forever, matter what. frightening people dont wear mask?

If vaccinated, scare people could lying. We'll get faster vaccinated remove masks.

It's looking like anti-vaxxers allowed go lot places mask, see much incentive can‚Äôt choose wear mask?  Schools closed year, low enough risk send child battle unvaccinated asshats. shit they'll lie. already wear masks anyways makes think care anyone vaccine believe body choice. wear mask anymore. businesses ask say need continue day.  USDA regulates meat. Source? people know cdc made bad decision let people unmask, reddit idiots still question Don‚Äôt know skin color it? I‚Äôm Denver even worst pandemic I‚Äôve seen people color wearing masks wearing like chin diaper. sad part many friends I‚Äôve lost say masks work virus actual accruing thing reality. statements apparently highly unpopular live. learned nothing last year half? Adults still getting chance first shot, never mind second, never mind time takes immunity actually build up, never mind everyone cannot get vaccinated actual reasons compromised immune systems. fun fact using it. thank you! vast majority epidemiologists disagree CDC decision:

Excellent Twitter thread: days oldies rushed get vaccinated

People joked this, months ad campaign get people vaccinated effective local infections 70%, better. 50% much closer 38% 70%. * Former CDC member Presidential Advisory Council HIV/AIDS Obama says keep wearing masks 700 epidemiologists agree course - point going meaningful additional surges hospitals overwhelmed. want vaccine, get it. So...let's go. CDC reported data supposed state residency, dose administered. small asterisk Texas data because, well, Texas. 

Source: even close. Look: miracle vaccines (started mere ""education"" immune system over-react) reality starts protecting immediately case infection (rare) gets immune system takes control beautifully. (also surprise): case infection (rare) load small can't even spread body let alone infecting others.

game over. hats off: thank God heroes gave us vaccines. FAR efficient human-made creation. news... water wet. Ohio mask mandate officially ends June 2nd, I‚Äôll fully vaccinated 3rd.

I‚Äôm still happy got vaccinated, won‚Äôt obvious flex nay sayers  conflicts guidance AAP indicating risker 2 mask. us children 2 neither mask get vaccine...we'll keep living rock. forgetting many millions gotten sick already wo getting vaccine. numbers wrong it‚Äôs Wayyy more. example 5 people house got one tested. people got covid protection also even vaccinated. number people unvaccinated lying asymptomatic spreading super low.  false narrative. I'd also throw nearly complete halt international travel ring significant reason flu rates plummeting. 

We actually make year's flu vaccines basis strains prevalent parts world tends make rounds across planet. Halt still good protection last year's vaccines infections. difficult see could major impact too. I‚Äôm concerned young children unable receive vaccine likely encounter unmasked people, including unvaccinated people anti-mask may contagious. feel lucky live Honolulu local government decided keep mask mandates place.  don‚Äôt care, lie vaccinated don‚Äôt wear mask get sick it‚Äôs funeral. Vaccinating children necessary completely eradicate COVID, doesn‚Äôt appear CDC‚Äôs primary goal right now. projection won‚Äôt reach herd immunity US, don‚Äôt think eradication even possibility. still catch spread covid even got vaccine... lessens chances ending hospital. personal choice. risk individual spoken primary doctor decide get vaccinated, awesome. 

Stop bullying people shit they‚Äôll lie. Well walked local grocery store father proudly wearing Liberty University t-shirt wandering place son. unmasked. I'm sure science taking dumbass variable account. That's strawman cause said target classier walmart sense common see inappropriately dressed people target, whereas everywhere walmart. better human being. I'm getting shit make dinner, seeing someones ass entire body tight clothes isnt radar im buying groceries.  POV: Today found ""expert"" getting vaccine confirm, lie. deceased  need expert tell that. Oh wow! Really? aren‚Äôt allowed work hospital without vaccinations parents supposed power can't even take kid grocery store us now? Anyone kid 12 basically fucked herd immunity authorize vaccine little kids. can? 1 year old become eligible? Thanks update. getting political. really care science data says vaccines work. commend CDC finally looking past politics using data guide. Keeping mine on. sick year! usually get sinus infections 6-8 times year strep throat minimum 3 times. probably wear long lol. like staying healthy great.üòä   old boss already this. gave weekend going stop wearing mask. don‚Äôt believe raw data decision made shared widely. 

And don‚Äôt mean link studies there. mean actual spreadsheets saw make big decision. made public.

I think CDC caved pressure. Ok, even caved, could followed communications 101 - surprise people, prepare giving plenty heads up. 

I happy way handled.  saying ""racism impact"" political? full quote seems completely Almost relate social determinants health dating back disadvantageous conditions people color find birth regarding availability adequate diet, access healthcare undeniable effects racism society. Still sounds racist. I‚Äôve heard kind argument pretty racist people. wonder establishments continue tolerate masks post-pandemic. Pre-pandemic, enter business establishments government buildings wearing mask, would asked remove security reasons. add /s kids vaccinated need wear good maks stay home. Full stop. rights end start infringe mine. care think ""a fucking mask"".

I sure hope took stance people refusing wear masks avoid indoor gatherings unnecessary travel vaccine available. Especially since ‚Äúright wear mask‚Äù, people right recklessly exposed preventable virus (just like nobody right drive however want, right walk around naked), government right enact restrictions protect public. hospitals hire nurses Bachelor Science Nursing. lot ""R.N. BSN"" name tags. There's recommended percentage nursing staff must degree, hospital qualify magnet status. Bored. Watching youtube. You? Yeah there's breakthrough cases people vaccinated still get COVID, means die know people people lives trying protect can't get vaccinated whatever reason (beyond lazy). Wearing mask literally harms one. DUDE; drinking bleach covid magically go away wern't Fauci. anti-maskers arn't using science derive opinions; People didn‚Äôt wear masks around Arkansas anyway, literally nothing changed. refuse raw dog Home Depot air even though I‚Äôm vaccinated. Hell point mask smug remark protective device. get Covid yet? appeal science sounds bit hollow since time, CDC releasing detailed data breakthrough cases locations. Don‚Äôt take kids stores. 

Vaccinated adults won‚Äôt spread virus kids. Vaccination hesitant? basically months waiting shit roll out. even time vaccine hesitant yet. Literally places two weeks since vaccines even open availability anyone 65 higher risk even getting appointment run like that. fast vaccine rollout supposed like 70% population? week? we‚Äôre dumb enough need experts tell us people liars? Duh since BC covid That's true. actually unreasonable there's purpose vaccinated people wearing masks point

It might look little less safe, really isn't

If that's risky you, welcome stay home. Well, duh may right place ask still possible carry transfer virus getting vaccinated? confirmed impossible thus new mask rules people vaccinated. vaccinated know I‚Äôll lie. That's right lies everything. John Marston checking in. Don‚Äôt trust government. good example. sacrifice minority population often. One example handicapped spaces. wouldn‚Äôt call coddling either. Neither would say saving lives preventing hospitalizations. Bake away, toys!  Give places week absorb new guidance decide do. meantime can‚Äôt blame anyone enforcing current rules, don‚Äôt people follow example see. 

I forgotten mask couple times recently too, it‚Äôs telling I‚Äôm comfortable new guidance. I‚Äôd say slipped mind don‚Äôt worry it...I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs nothing personal bartender. ""repercussions"" fucking know it. attempting terrify people either agreeing shutting mouths. 

Exploiting corporate HR departments ability fire anyone anything ""repercussions"" either. 

You're coward can't defeat arguments public square honest discussion everything shut down. Eh, fuck that. There's nothing harmful people wearing mask choose. flip side, pandemic, wearing one literally meant people dying. two different outcomes. think people point whatever fuck want vaccinated, wear one comparison public shaming kind false equivalence. Fighting racism racism answer. country becoming pot shit, overflowing hatred support type racism color ethnic group. friends color think way well. Yeah number people can't get vaccinated effectively zero bullshit talking point. hope bad major events related Let lie? end affects us vaccinated ones  Quick question. you‚Äôre vaccinated matter others aren‚Äôt take mask off. potentially can‚Äôt spread contract doesn‚Äôt matter.. immune system simple. vaccine provides stronger longer lasting protection natural immunity alone. nothing else could consider JNJ one done don‚Äôt want inconvenienced it.  mean even lie it‚Äôs officially now. want lie vaccinated that‚Äôs problem. vaccinate yourself. Yeah felt kind weird nights got shots. arm sore head kinda tingled. hurt told friend ""I feel like high"" LOL Next day arm felt better tingle anymore good. (Pfizer- Vaccine) two kids age 7 10 feel much. wife vaccinated kids basically sacrificed. know kids general get sick I've read lots stories people getting Covid hospitalized yet still get kind organ damage stay whole life. worry kids going get get week find lifelong complications later. sad part church. amount hate towards basic safety astounding. go faith, it‚Äôs keeps sane.  real. I'm introvert, mean prefer isolation masks forever, that's sure lol Perhaps they're confusing social anxiety.  main concern large numbers idiots super spreading masks, increasing chances significant mutation may make vaccine ineffective. hopefully happen, people foolish enough get vaccinated despite able to, deal consequences actions enjoy lives. Fuck employees poor people? take expert say many (not all) americans lie. Lots americans notorious liars. Look previous potus! Now, comorbidities [hypertension, chronic lung disease, diabetes obesity] racial determinants...Fauci said. ‚ÄúAlmost relate social determinants health ... ""and undeniable effects racism society.""

 went fact check accuracy quote- appreciate Dr likely wanting bring attention noble cause 
- whilst spend much time look topic course missed much nuance- , would seem perspective (that social factors, diet, racism etc primary sole determinants conditions) little simplistic-- illustrate ; here's coverage racial genetic/biological determinants across minority group go way explaining observed heightened incidence comorbidities study found biological risk factors‚Äîincluding weight fat around abdomen‚Äîare primarily responsible higher rates diabetes black Americans compared white Americans.

**Chronic lung disease**
. Haha even mean? hell lol. put lives risk part chain died. point want remain vulnerable, they'll ones dealing decisions. know Sunday Sunday numbers low due lot states reporting god damn worldometers reported less 18k cases today. 26k last Sunday.

So many states turning yellow. great see Literally, friends room mate talking faking vaccination card oddest thing is, get people worried outdoor transmission...it's pretty much proven/obvious always spread way faster indoors due air circulation.  Personally, go food tastes best, understand point. 

With said, folks Costco today unsure do, wore mask car Costco like process since wearing mask COVID-19 became thing, others carried mask looked around, saw folks wearing them, put entered, nobody went without. 

Was interesting thought would jumped chance wear mask. Personally, planning wearing one fully vaccinated time, figured want one, wore mine. love people like throw word strawman like actually relevant. Like cool thing. Lol. 

I address people thinking target better comment replied to. I'm introducing new idea.

This argument pointless neither us gain anything it, except hopefully understanding repeating ideas context reddit silly.

Either way. Target still classy. I'm argue that. opinion can't changed.

Have good day know long term consequences COVID kids. may less deadly flu causing heart damage? Lung scarring? Neurological issues? hopeful none things know yet. simply want kids get it. Odds tell would fine, there's many unknowns point. I'm expert liar, wear mask even I'm vaccinated

Winck winck Someone please remind me, 'voluntarily' refused get vaccine? Oh I'm sorry, I'll trust *your* medical expertise instead theirs. Seriously, appreciate healthy skepticism, trust experts use common sense. Remember officials told us Covid airborne? remember told masks unnecessary buy any? blame people taking ""official guidance"" grain salt?  Honestly, I'll keep I've doing. find need wear one outdoors indoors, I'll keep wearing one everyone social circle/bubble fully vaxxed. mom fully vaccinated, concern me.   genuinely care point you‚Äôre probably scarred life. may never comfortable normalcy again. COVID isn‚Äôt over. it‚Äôs ever gonna be. it‚Äôs time quit bitching people start minding fucking business first time 14 months. course lie. learned nothing virus politics last year taught us? People pieces shit never underestimate much asshole someone capable Also, problem COVID-19 isn‚Äôt exists - it‚Äôs human body zero experience it. 

Post pandemic bodies starting point virus hasn‚Äôt many viable variants. Hopefully future like chicken pox. sounds like one family members recently. Claimed allergies, refused get tested, passed along one household members high risk category (luckily individual recovered fully) nerve tell person tested positive ‚Äúit‚Äôs Covid. flu‚Äù. amount anger harboring cannot adequately expressed. Yeah man I'm sure know him. admitted planes air circulation gut definitely knows better. Source? It‚Äôs hard. also argue lot people Covid essential workers prioritized higher vaccination eligibility queue.

But think you‚Äôre probably right. Asking friend, hit phase natural selection? friend may cool that. someone anti vax point history, it‚Äôs real shame catch virus exit rough time. work *at hospital* exposure, hospital testing admin weekly refused allow test quarantine. drive 50 miles away get test. job involves walking hospital. 

They strict temperature taking theater doors completely give shit internally. also ended testing 100* fever let go home quarantine essential. 90% department worked home. reason hate job actively looking new one there's nothing around except fast food unfortunately. Screw em. won‚Äôt get vaccinated o4 wear masks care anymore. I‚Äôm vaccinated. Fauchi enough mashugana. Remember, insanity think everybody else insane yourself. votes. Get hint. Take step back. Read books. Expand mind. Ignore echo chambers you‚Äôve listening long.  I'm getting vaccinated knowing others liars. Lol. really believing flu gone. absorbed covid. people sick told prob false negative never tested. flu numbers bs. way pcp rarely test flu that? white blood cells combating natural infection fighting live virus therefore didn‚Äôt get viable antibodies? also exposed lack public health competence government, lets focus racism instead. Kids high risk all. Jesus kid üòÇ  lol Republicans always lie. Even know saying based upon lie. entire GOP terrorist organization.  kind wonder conflict affecting reporting way understand difference, well, know say.

We call ""cockney"" variant. Recommend yourself, son. Also look learning slow adults too. never thought Wales would good giving people shots. always thought big  Don‚Äôt need expert tell say work aren‚Äôt stopping people wearing masks due new rule. Man people still yell employees wearing masks even though company making us every right do. whole pandemic made hate people. Like mind business don‚Äôt wear mask. I‚Äôm sick honestly. energy to... put piece cloth face?

Nobody expects perfect solution. That's partial solutions mattered.

And we're either weeks away point matter anyone wears mask - we're already. 

I'm mostly confused people think they've told *not* wear mask. Like know difference ""you can"" ""you must."" stolen vocabulary calling critics ""anti-science""--

I think third humanity understands reality level Yo Mama joke. 

They recognize shape argument. navigate many discussions sensibly. they've actually learned memorize repeat specific phrases specific situations. Like arguments winning, winning means right comeback. reasoned debate conflicting viewpoints. insult swordfighting Monkey Island. 

So someone says ""thanks, CDC, I'll keep I'm doing,"" ""correct"" response is, ""trust science!"" Context matter. least cautious CDC wants. *obeying* experts, experts, that's science is. Claims exist evaluated. cards shuffled, play right one situation. 

Otherwise fucking idea people thinking. That's lame argument, sentence  Less 10% people area wearing masks now. know fucking fact we've got less 60% vaccination town. rest us live lives Covid ravage remainder

except dont hit herd immunity, virus mutate vaccine-resistant strain we're fucked again.

If virus affected assholes could vaccinate wont, wouldnt care.

But case. going fuck things rest us Yes, unvaccinated people including small children vaccine yet exist easily susceptible Covid variants. People lie; mostly effect themselves. virus mutating quickly. would think get (and spread) strain again? 

By wearing masks, getting tested, getting vaccinated, focusing attention risk. 

Your recklessness endangers people. last year half given reason believe Americans would honest getting vaccinated. funny cuz always work people don‚Äôt flu vaccines, defer hep B, currently covid vaccinated. blanket requirement. missed part said everyone WANTED got it. Sure adults vaccinated want that's them. know small % unable get medical issues 99% got yet choosing amount waiting going change that.

Kids hand legit sacrificed. ‚ÄúEvery fucking person US expert way‚Äù survival. Long term side effects covid brutal. Also really sure vaccines wearing mask. people continue wear masks next month Nearly every state platuead well though. assume would keep dropping?? I'm saying even know would happen masks low levels. Well duh. cares point? get vaccinated low risk catching covid shouldn‚Äôt matter. get vaccinated want too, continue wearing mask want too, don‚Äôt want get vaccinated don‚Äôt, it‚Äôs health decisions Yeah that's insane. Again, numbers obviously artificially low, every Sunday low Sunday... probably mini wave deaths happens winter time flu shit. incredibly jarring seeing someone Walmart without mask on. I'm vaccinated I'm keeping mask Saw Week ABC. reporter ripped new butt hole. Hmmm... Yes, floor made floor trust know sure, lately don‚Äôt trust always telling truth. Unbelievable, people want pandemic end, they? least people afraid live lives been, unless shut-in lifestyle pandemic preferable way? believe means 95% people would gotten sick instead not. means 20 100 would gotten sick without vaccine, 1 100 vaccine get sick.

If anyone knows better meaning vaccine efficacy stats, let know got wrong. Whoever said terrible twos must left children 2. Twos cake walk compared late 3s.

At 2, can't still argue logically least good way. 4, easily outsmart questions l good reason already. Theyre right though. dont hit herd immunity, virus mutate vaccine-resistant variant unvaccinated fucks we're right back started. kids flu shot though.

Meanwhile childrens hospital mother works bunch kids covid ward.

So ya, concerned kids vs covid. go maskless healthcare? don‚Äôt see happening anytime soon, around here. vaccinated Covid less equivalent cold almost every single vaccinated person‚Ä¶I think you‚Äôre failing grasp outcomes insanely different vaccinated unvaccinated people.

Because it‚Äôs silly put piece cloth I‚Äôm already massively reduced risk way would silly always drive five miles per hour speed limit even though might decrease overall risk marginal fraction. wearing mask longer means endangering others, vaccines good. could get fired job day. could get fired mine. Anyone get anyone fired. isnt difficult least, absolutely nothing whatever thought police violation report someone's employer. remember organization told people wear masks last year. shock people still traumatized distrusting. Granted, Trump's fault people move forget shit overnight. Duh card useless, proof vaccination needed international travel medium-term future. Republicans lie. Kids don't. I‚Äôm ordinary citizen don‚Äôt trust whole lot. know history especially country. know reasons shouldn‚Äôt trust much. don‚Äôt always best interests heart. okay. one else knew either. Lol. Exactly haha person would lie vaccinated, they‚Äôre kind person wouldn‚Äôt worn masks anyway. LOL, I'm area 70% people got first shot people still religious mask wearing. 40% country part political party that's modus operandi lies lies lies.

Most vaccinated, all. 100%, we'd thrilled. Honestly reading director said felt lot better. I‚Äôm deleting going say say this:

What immunocompromised folks? don‚Äôt get choice, unmasked actually hurting others. literally millions people US alone hesitant vaccines, every shred good news helps.  logic could applied US now, unless first dose vaccinations significantly pick up. So? vacation work? True, children continue wear masks. answer nothing. Well SHIT SHERLOCK Time flat circle, man. realize lot people countries wear masks (way COVID) want spread around flu shit? actually care other? think forceful attitude WAY antisocial. nutritionist know can't eat expired food.  seen landlords charge pets? That's real scam. deposit. charge pet rent. tf dog making apartment expensive way another entire human wouldn't? even return deposit either, whether pet damaged anything not. There's way hell deep cleaning carpet fur costs much. Except long term side effects today may never go away could cause complications later hey, dying 100% equals perfectly healthy afterwards. know little long term effects let's pretend nothing happens current evidence fluke. Evolution progress. anyone gotten vaccine thus far, either want able get appt. relaxation masking makes fence-sitters go ""great! need wear mask get vaccine"" many things people try ***not*** around kids.

&amp;#x200B;

so slap mask 

it's fall. yeah, scary. know good nurses, like cousin, man many bad ones mother telling many kids children's hospital covid ward make super comfortable others repeating ""no risk kids"". might popular, one whose ok this? people want vaccine get it, already gotten it. people going lie wont, haven‚Äôt warn mask regardless. let flood gates go, let dont believe get infected quickly, reach herd immunity vax infected people, move on? aren‚Äôt going win IQ lot people dont believe it. need move forward. risk vaxed, don‚Äôt want let Darwin cage Weird I've never fired work action I've ever taken.
Maybe see therapist, seem pretty upset something. call throwing tantrum ""defeating argument public square""   Maybe newest planes good filtration circulation.  lot planes use new smell Poo gas sit even rows bathroom. 

As frequent traveler post covid, always taking vitamin C Zyrtec first signs cold. Spoiler alert, keep pandemic going another 3 fucking years. pay choices maybe pay healthcare insurance. Yeah original point shame people wearing masks? odd. Let people can't get vaccinated continue wear need to. selective pressure evade vaccine countries. US perfect place happen large vaccinated unvaccinated population interacted unrestrictedly other. experts correct.  course they‚Äôll lie??? Hello?  That's true, still places people waiting get vaccinated. i'm talking people ""waiting data"" ""want see things go."" lots people may urgency now. course will. There‚Äôs already people busted selling fake cards. cards useless. Personally, don‚Äôt care. I‚Äôm vaccinated. Open floodgates, look way, let infect either die severely harm future health ignorance need better everyone else. FINE me. statement ironic actually benefits care people. benefit treat others kindly likely going treat kindly return. even somebody selfish still care people even self interest. moronic selfish people understand that. real. Came say ‚Äúno shit Sherlock‚Äù mean science there, vaccines work. article statement sends bad message think ridiculous shame people choose keep wearing mask. harm anyone ""free"" country, let people want.  really hope teach gym...  went bar Texas yesterday 5000 people mask sight everyone chilling it‚Äôs big deal guys chill opinion CDC factor millions people age 12? Really? honestly arguing that?

If that's true, I've got crystal sell cure autism caused vaccines. suspected got covid early 2020 testing available missed cutoff antibodies test became available. 

Ever since get winded easily cough never going go away. Doctors say asthma it. I'm even risk. Covid weakens ends you.  school district districts around us dropped mask mandate tomorrow. Don‚Äôt need expert come conclusion. 50% population lie flaw reasoning ‚Äúnothing worry about‚Äù false. population level, yes, low risk. Individually, there‚Äôs way know advance. don‚Äôt think telling parent hey, it‚Äôs 1 1000 chance kid die! Nothing worry about! still don‚Äôt understand science is. Science doesn‚Äôt make public policy recommendations. Science tells likelihoods people decide it. Makes sense now? 

Is likelihood thousands people die let half population (unvaccinated) ditch masks due eliminated social pressure vaccinated people ditch theirs? Science says is. decide question science does. hope take away something exchange. care actions hurt people choice. personally think there's nothing wrong people society want wear masks, even COVID over. Believe not, parts world, sick, considerate thoughtful wear one people care spreading diseases. antisocial thing people shaming people vaccinated wearing mask there's nothing wrong people still want wear one, imo. Prozac helps. weed. Experts correct. Haven‚Äôt seen people mistrusted cdc following science since last year republican pages . Guess guys üò¨ No, definitely people follow mask mandates, protect pandemic yet time get vaccinated refuse get it. I'm saying people want wear masks forever love them, want wear masks forever either get vaccinated get COVID.

Antivaxxers come sides political spectrum. recently come mainstream one side.  That's mostly they've along exception densely packed indoor situations.

All goofballs walking parks riding bicycles masks past year fueled skeptics hysterical confining masks appropriate settings. Even people lie it‚Äôs unlikely actually change anyone‚Äôs behavior outside - meaning, people would lie vaccine status mostly people already wearing masks, won‚Äôt huge increase unvaccinated people wearing Because, issue CDC's guidelines vaccinated. issue millions Americans anti-maskers/anti-vaxxers lie vaccinated refuse wear mask take undue advantage honor system, spreading virus. 175 million Americans still unvaccinated, many got eligible, eligible yet, suffer consequences willful sabotage recovery efforts. short, unvaccinated liars masks spread virus, could cause another surge. looked India. Woosh Covfefe lmao, since saw cares vaccinated safe. rest play Darwin.     I'm glad fully vaccinated. I'm going file Shit Sherlock pile... I'm going file Shit Sherlock pile... working recruiter, boss (who dickhead 35 years industry belt) taught piece advice I've able put use many life situations since:

Everybody lies.  cares? I‚Äôm vaccinated I‚Äôm safe. family vaccinated. stopped wearing mask got vaccinated back February. That‚Äôs vaccines work. Vaccines free available everyone, care unvaccinated people get sick? chance. Fuck people twitter freaking demanding keep mask mandate geez enforcement.....is COVID-19......nature metal like bafoon spelt manner natural immunity point, it‚Äôs nowhere near immunity levels vaccine. know multiple people Covid multiple times vaccine accessible. I‚Äôm skeptical changing herd immunity significant amount. 

I‚Äôm immunologist, don‚Äôt take say fact.

Also stronger Immune response isn‚Äôt necessarily good, Cytokine storm seems relevant severity Covid. Clippy! Dying laughing here.  I'd ask hellacious company work mine better including points system.  can't... 35+...  digital.
In India linked Adhar (like SSN im US). Anyone verify it. ‚ÄúExperts‚Äù people going vaccinated never wearing masks first place. seriously don‚Äôt understand can‚Äôt stick know works! wear mask!  real world, opposed ivory towers CDC, ""mask turnaround"" completely idiotic.

This decree gives people feel like wearing mask permission wear it. assume almost everyone, whether vaccinated not. institution person going set arbiter whether someone vaccinated, even technically possible. anyone even asks, take person's word it.

So effect, US said ""it's okay everyone stop wearing masks."" idea anyone public health role would say anything remotely like this, especially spent year trying get everyone *wear* mask.

I predict another notorious self-own CDC. people wearing masks probably got vaccine already, wearing masks lying vaccine. message much clear basically screaming masks week. get least 50 percent first. getting people back work ending extended unemployment benefits. That's it. matter low-risk people continue wear masks? 

You surprising number ‚Äúnormal‚Äù things wearing mask. Shopping, dining, visiting museum, attending play, attending sporting event, working...heck, even go zip-lining mask (did last week). 

I guess don‚Äôt see big deal is. Wearing mask impacted enjoyment activities. I‚Äôm happy wear mask means people work places feel comfortable me. lot people apathetic. really care wear mask don't. usually unless forgot something. mildly uncomfortable can't hurt wear one. big deal. emoji cynical laughter sarcasm turned 11? got tshirt box cookies second dose today. pretty excited Given lockdown protests, mask protests, fake medical exemption cards, vaccine conspiracy theories, covid hoax conspiracy theories name things, chance large number people wont lie vaccination status non-zero.

Get ready third wave death b1617. hierarchy Covid suppression goes follows:

Vaccination/Natural want proof, look Japan. Japanese disciplined mask wearing since vaccination rates currently pathetic, can't really cause significant downtrend cases despite heavy mask usage. Dumbasses really think unvaccinated people listen wear mask encourage get vaccinated. come say hit 60 percent fully vaccinated masks come off. might encourage them. whole everyone rip means vaccination numbers going go way way Wingo! H1N1 endemic. Also drugs. many kitchens run cocaine, especially really fancy ones.  every teenager ever. (Including myself.) unmasking never going easy. Sometimes like ripping bandaid. blind actual human behavior defies belief.

Thank you. CDC control state rules regulations though. Yes, states places immediately (or already had) removed mask mandate. states either announced later dates (the 21st May example), gives businesses time prepare plan. thought masks kept people safe, that‚Äôs CDC said. mask keeps safe, mask keeps safe. no? mean CDC prematurely decided pandemic over? Honor systems never work relays solely good nature individuals. bad individuals susceptible bad things lying manipulation. personally think way soon removing mask mandates. pandemic taught anything, it‚Äôs humans way dumber thought like high level. Covid spreading via aerosols. excess air cant make mask going around it. Even air going mask still carrying covid. care people want wear mask, I'm trying tell anyone wear, come on, masks people wear safety blanket. Honestly give anyone vaccinates vaccinated $100. adults either, like teens go get get $100 too. get $100 second dose Pfizer Moderna get J&amp;J. 

People would less hesitant going getting J&amp;J would easiest way make quick cash imaginable. Market such. We'd herd immunity within couple months. 

If worried cost, even every person US got vaccinated would &lt;5% annual military budget (roughly $100 x 330 million = $33 billion, vs estimated $934 billion spent military), one-time deal.  Nobody who's actually wearing ready ditch them.

An actual quote saw Reddit today. people denial. dumb argument. Wear mask you‚Äôre worried yourself. Kids risk that‚Äôs non issue. Immunocompromised get vaccine mask want. 

No reason let rest languish mask mandate sillyness. I've seen 6-week one page seemed based serology/antibody level. also really wide CI point, graph looked like certain part male anatomy üòÇ. interesting see release additional data, anything while.

Obviously J&amp;J really becomes equivalent Pfizer/Moderna 57 days like serology indicates obviously would great thing, published anything beyond one-page yet.  show cancelled. played stale. ever credible political factor again. best, he'll manage split party guarantee fall irrelevancy. And, ultimately disagree new CDC mask guidance, brilliant political move makes nearly impossible conservatives effectively attack Biden; really helps solidify centrist.  many people wearing masks begin with? places enforcing mask wearing anyway I‚Äôd willing bet people would lie vaccinated already wearing mask. mhm, definitely part it, also random bad guidelines masks like, sick/workers wear masks What‚Äôs clear safe unvaccinated go maskless. individuals states decide navigate that. Dropping mask mandates seems like dropping ball. get give daddy like 3 weeks ago. Whoever thought US-Americans trustworthy law-abiding sure taught differently past years.

I literally people show fucking vaccination cards run D&amp;D game live. You‚Äôre full shit Honestly care. chose vaccinated. Let get it. hopefully. Fully vaccinated, continue wear masks indoors stores commercial buildings, indoor dining -- kind vaccine pass admission, pandemic really control US reasonable control globally - may never. Perfectly fine ordering food home, ordering groceries curbside pickup, using Amazon equivalent, outdoor recreation, meeting friends fully vaccinated, etc. still enough disease (long term effects, epidemiology/health effects new variants) significant portion population vaccinated (in cases choice). necessarily bro. gramma mom got despite taking every precaution could. reason don‚Äôt add asymptomatic without insurance time, couldn‚Äôt get test say sure. 

You wanna know get infected? gramma playing cards group one lying dumbass old coot refuses take even single precaution traveling almost nonstop since whole thing started. infected whole group claims she‚Äôs never it. in: duh. article indication threat COVID recedes masks become mostly useless comforting security blanket anxious people. bit sad unexpected. ah, classic weekly 'shit America' post, almost like even though everyone across planet could lie, really Americans real problem! /s many people going lie vaccinated avoid wearing mask think currently wearing masks? much I‚Äôd like see universal masking continue kids fully vaccinated don‚Äôt know it‚Äôs much risk since reason vaccinated people wear masks ease enforcement places honor system anyway.  hahahahahahhahahahaha. ok  gotta expert know lie üòÖ Tbh entire time I've saying trust organizations CDC. Iirc recommended masking pretty fucking late recommended restrictions late well. didnt even admit virus airborne recently, likely fear ramifications would heavy restrictions shit be. 

Them, like us government organization, want disrupt economy even means saving lives. 

So mask recommendations easing now, 12 group get shot, another instance CDC putting profits optics ahead safety. patients immunosuppressive treatments cancer lupus arthritis...üò¢üò®üò¢ DYK sky blue? Yes. announce major policy changes inform people beforehand give businesses enough time react. 

That‚Äòs good governance. There‚Äòs reason states roadmaps connected certain vaccination numbers dates. 

Give people time plan. expert dirtbag friends say they‚Äôre going lie. I‚Äôm vaccinated wasn‚Äôt I‚Äôd lie. think need re-read comments. Never say life shouldn‚Äôt move on. happy moving direction!

However wish people (like guy replying to) would least think enough realize also means anti-vaxx people maskless spreading anti-vaxxers (no prob) can‚Äôt get vaccinated yet (maybe problem).

Also, us live places less 30% people got vaccinated close vaccination centers early due lack interest. I‚Äôm guessing majority people without masks aren‚Äôt vaccinated. me? biggie. I‚Äôm vaxxed. it‚Äôs insane think aren‚Äôt might still tad cautious.

Clearly I‚Äôm communicating point well. Yes, you‚Äôre vaccinated, take mask, go out, celebrate! You‚Äôre done personal responsibility.

It would nice people could least ridicule shame people still masking still hesitant maybe say ‚ÄúIT‚ÄôS 100% OVER!!! haven‚Äôt gotten vaccinated now, it‚Äôs you‚Äôre dumb, anyone could get vaccine wanted!‚Äù That‚Äôs flat lie makes think they‚Äôre trolling. Anyone shred common sense says they‚Äôll lie, don‚Äôt need expert see clear pattern behavior.   Sigh... don‚Äôt appreciate laughing comment  Cases nearly 1/10th winter peak, masking behavior hasn‚Äôt increased then, yet people sincerely believing somehow effective tool have.

Vaccination masking 

Natural immunity masking Worth noting one dose gives 80% protection hospitalisation weeks, two doses gives 90%. Pfizer AZ.

There always breakthrough cases, even breakthrough deaths. it‚Äôs important reach herd immunity, virus can‚Äôt spread. Yep, thats take it. state one highest vaccination rates country positivity rates 1%. feel safe removing mask fully vaccinated person. 

If lived area lower compliance higher infection rates, feelings may different. I'm bud many people honestly think paying fake vaccine cards? good enough hospitalisation. least AstraZeneca: course going lie course will! people think vaccines change DNA could grow tail vaccines contain microchips. course can't trust them, course can't rely them. wasn;t assuming that, believe another commenter implying fault brother didnt get shot, isn't. That's all. Flawed logic course benefits mask cost possibly touching it, remember possible risk (which wild since viruses transmit better contact COVID) ‚ÄúFlorida man bad‚Äù Yeah, I'm going defer CDC rather you. Also, since can't compel proof vaccination yet still legally liable (among things) potential workman's comp claims, legally much smarter now. best reality, one exist now. Well we‚Äôd keep masks forever we‚Äôre never reaching 70% vaccinated.  Expecting people honor obey honor system. LOL, rich. saw first ""in wild"" example this. guy arguing mask mandate gone poor girl register explain (it's NY yet).

Also, always homeless people refuse use masks. Coming next, think Pope Catholic &amp; bears possibly defecate woodland. Tom  time need point masking post vaccination actually making meaningfully safer wearing one indication anxiety. Yep, live south ton folks surely skip vaccine. hell reaction 2nd shot want find I'm susceptible breakthrough covid infection. high risk groups include young children immune compromised illness like HIV/AIDS treatments cancer, lupus, arthritis, etc. Dude. Yikes. Seriously? I‚Äôm blind lmfao. There‚Äôs big difference. hate human interaction, say that. everyone wants wear reminders worst year life forever Policy isn‚Äôt job, they‚Äôve tried make recommendations way meant influence policy, hasn‚Äôt always turned well. job say ‚Äúhere‚Äôs data says,‚Äù let agencies make policy based that. would prefer lie tell us vaccinated still vector. would worse. Y‚Äôall wanna trust people put trump office? Yikes forget people fake vaccination cards too..  place employment pretty similar. 

They revamped leave policy split PTO sick leave instead clumping altogether mitigate the, ""i'm taking 'vacation' cold"" mindset. put emphasis telling supervisor take sick leave (ideally 2 weeks!). Sure plan medical appointment also next time get flu. /s places live rolling back? probably businesses work I'll still need it. two three days ago were? don‚Äôt anymore don‚Äôt want to.

Yes fully vaccinated several months. work unvaccinated individuals every day indoors. 

Not chancing covid.  still catch it, carry it, pass vaccinated, yes vaccine effective numbers, continue place world mostly vaccinated, third world countries getting vaccines promised Europe America's greedy lifestyles. Schools unvaccinated populations safe hoard 30 class 6 hours day, children vulnerable someone who's seen personally, many even know wear mask follow regulations set public health, WHO, CDC American, need combination better vaccine rollouts worldwide masking go back used continue disgusting, unsanitary species. I've whole time bud. Never left  Didnt already say 12+ ? much get fined don‚Äôt self isolate going holiday amber list country returning uk. Seen anything ¬£1000-10,000. Asking friend needed experts this? Lol. Lmao hope useless considering there‚Äôs 99% survival rate. went store yesterday 80% people wearing masks. also area lot push back masks mandated antimaskers, least people still it. There's way many vaccinated majority still believe exist. Now? Good luck! many waves next one be? Idek anymore, amount areas like across US way higher be. collection masks though. I'm vaccinated....or I? not. current estimate found 500. 150 people hospitalized tested positive influenza. 7x average number influenza tests given. 

Are citing worldwide estimate? US nonexistent  Oh know offer false information. person see walking store maskless stating ""I vaccinated"" someone know absolutes certainty vaccinated. People like protect tweets...... CDC invoking honor system. family members, coworkers, neighbors feel masks unnecessary burden (because covid ‚Äújust cold‚Äù ‚Äúa hoax‚Äù) precisely continue wearing masks, ones game honor system. 

Many us understand pandemic major ongoing public health disaster continue mask public even vaccination, included, public health team sport.

TLDR; masks aren‚Äôt major burden, pandemic over. Telling people stop masking indoors public harmful, benefits absolutely one. got upvoted? sub lately? Waiting day quantum computer run simulations list drugs effective Good thing they‚Äôll fine like week... lol Yeah pretty much. hope new guidelines people recognize acting irrationally based extreme health anxiety rather smugly insisting following science. well year, personally believe point, afraid go public stay home. That‚Äôs guilty pleasure too. favorites get arrested. News alert, 99.7% survive. even higher percentage none 70+. Perhaps science strong suit. Fuckin non experts say theyll lie that's folks.

I expert something. 

Calling mom let know.  work you:  People liars, people stupid, people stupid liars. ready ditch mine, without hesitation, 2 week second dose.   expose every single person lies point life sure. guess i'm thinking can't rely everyone get vaccinated, lean ""natural immunity"" extent. extent, knows. Gonna need $20 CVS antibody tests, asap. know OP still alive, know gender. fully understand many people expressing OP's position care covid. means care people. 

The fact remains unvaccinated people places virus could reside long enough mutate become deadly, contagious, problem. ""back normal"" life want would never possible point. 

People social distanced, wore masks, listened experts ones ate getting things back normal. Please join us. Yes. will. Americans awful.  Glad got shots, I'm kinda use masks got one zipper mouth says 'assholes live forever"" gotten much wear. people created opioid epidemic aren‚Äôt trying infect us Covid. Based scientific research, tall 100% based height. Ask feel Donald Trump's death. Sure, think people want vaccinated been. would bother protecting don‚Äôt protect themselves? Links specific tests referring to? says 36.7% FV US now, projection 50% 17 June, 70% 6 August, &amp; 85% 12 September. earliest state appears Maine 50/70/85% FV dates today, 18 June, &amp; 13 July respectively. latest state, Mississippi forecast hit figures various points *2022*. go national figures, I'd expect mask mandate end either around 17 June 6 August depending metrics look like leading dates (maybe vaccinations accelerate meantime). Maybe good compromise could've 4 July? Oh well... probably conflated notion rendition virus killed millions, killing millions every year, gone. Vaccinated all, still rather wear mask public, seems gotten less fair share flu past year. code telling take personal responsibility point large swaths country dumb get vaccinated everyone going wait them. Haha get fucked we‚Äôre going back normal whether like not, there‚Äôs nothing Good fight. Good person crowd  know someone anti vaccine ironically anti mask. basically told continue wear mask matter what.  also remember time briefly argued masks might bad idea thought people would touching face much. begins ends X used make photocopiers. 


I work anymore, lost contract got hit wage theft suit. 


The point system terrible. told put employee final going hospital wife heart attack. Refused, told write instead problem it. I'd say important number 175. sample size extremely small !! small sample size never used take decision. read article? title match article, took it. And, though deaths sad sympathy families, look ages. severe breakthroughs elderly people. risk contracting transmitting Covid otherwise physically healthy vaccinated 41 year old low may well zero. vaccines *work.* Better would ever expected. I‚Äôm expert lied to. They‚Äôll definitely lie ID badge stickers employees vaccinated. Seems pretty simple.  normal things wearing mask. Nothing wearing mask diminishes experience things listed above. 

So must reason, hence question. Yes technically get odds vastly favor perfectly fine. Nothing world 100% safe need accept that.  Agree - country world successfully contained virus enforced masking. successful countries extremely effective quarantine policies strictly enforced social distancing policies. 

It insane claim anyone kept thing check masks, country‚Äôs aren‚Äôt even saying success. vaccines disturbed based Barnett formula, formula decides funding allocated different countries UK. deeply flawed based outdated populations, fails take account England's population risen far quicker others. 
 
Basically, England gets screwed countries get disproportionately supplies result. Idk difficult judge things current population, rather severely outdated figures, go. I‚Äôve fully vaccinated &amp; still wearing mask whenever I‚Äôm indoors people don‚Äôt know whether they‚Äôve vaccinated, etc. I‚Äôm critical care registered nurse bachelor‚Äôs degrees science &amp; nursing. I‚Äôve worked years. virus alarming frequently mutates - even HIV &amp; Ebola don‚Äôt mutate frequently SARS-CoV-2 does. extremely contagious virus well deadly. There‚Äôs lot learn yet, doctors &amp; scientists still aren‚Äôt sure attacks people severely &amp; others all. Also, seems like virus attacks lining blood vessels responsible damaging lungs, heart attacks, strokes, COVID-toe, ‚Äòbrain fog‚Äô &amp; impotency, name deadly &amp; weird side effects infected SARS-CoV-2. New studies aerosolization respiratory droplets revising ancient (&amp; unquestioned) studies 1930‚Äôs-1950‚Äôs, &amp; seem suggest respiratory particles remain air far longer amount time &amp; much farther distance previously thought. So, I‚Äôve gotten quite used wearing mask indoors strangers &amp; continue world vaccinated &amp; SARS-CoV-2 isn‚Äôt mutating frequently presently.  science checks out, think underestimated stupidity anti vaxxers anti maskers. claim vaccinated not. CDC include calculations, people willing plague rats. Nurses nearly 5 months vaccinated. folks worried 1) unvaccinated 2) obeying mask mandates anyway. 

The CDC‚Äôs recent ruling calculated percentage existing vaccinated people. county 75% weeks matter low-risk people continue wear masks?

This opinion choosing listen experts one, to. wear one want, answer question reply already answered post replying to.  Fucking duh? idk US really judge people buying medical papers like that. privilege able afford regular therapy sessions. Holy shit entitled Lie type person would lie vaccines would preposterous know I'm 10ft tall 1200lb ""person""who tried gain knowledge fire child fucky haircut. certain percentage survive suffer greatly. like flu, right? able vaccinated. saying since day one. Every single backlash traced back ‚Äúexperts‚Äù brains consider human behaviour.  doesn‚Äôt say. Science states people cannot get vaccinated. CDC says shots safe PEOPLE That‚Äôs phrased bonus, nice have.

And yup, sure do. Cheers ya. don‚Äôt think works way answer question.   Someone tell bury around water source You'\\re wrong, take vaccines, COVID vaccine safe people  Also ‚Äúcurrently infected convinced it‚Äôs hoax‚Äùü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è  covid though. 

You option vaccinate protect other. don‚Äôt want vaccinate I‚Äôd rather choice Good thing covid almost zero threat kids. Phew! Medical laboratory scientists probably thorough medical education jobs hospital require bachelors degree. Compared us nurses, definitely receive better education immunology. Like said there's benefits draw back. better get used masks cause stay. Maybe everyone see often before. kidding‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..  Went zoo today, pretty much one wearing No, 99.992% effective hospitilzation death, safe ever gonna be. Emotional support animals real thing many people confuse trained service animals. Even dog emotional support animal can‚Äôt take everywhere. use KF94, KN95, N95, employ social distance. 15 days first mRNA shot provides substantial protection. Review literature concerned. 

It's care them, reason restrict behavior fully vaccinated. partially vaccinated restrict necessary / within risk tolerance. It‚Äôs likely vaccines effective it.  Yes.  Easily  they? Gosh, that's pretty rad dont care. aren't, nobody cares. shot safe, regardless whether next guy social distance wear masks. really UK good while. Cases low staying low particular Indian variant came about. Well going wear mask UK even I‚Äôve jabs time. Don‚Äôt think fully understand yet still think there‚Äôs pain come. Yeah, fucking duh.   ""Everybody lies"" - Gregory House. ‚ÄúExperts‚Äù = everyone No, genuinely believed COVID aerosol-based virus, droplet based. Masks really protect droplets, believe masks required  think anyone defending people ridicule others wearing masks. 

But there's difference choosing wear mask putting kids wanting govt force everyone wear masks. 

I think we're point everyone risk long since opportunity get vaccinated, we're point govt let people make choices risks want take. dont make card cdc logo shows put light like dollar bill Experts curse humanity.   transmissible key question concerning scientists ministers. According minutes meeting last Tuesday government‚Äôs Scientific Advisory Group Emergencies (Sage), advisers believe transmission B.1.617.2, Indian variant known, ‚Äúis currently faster B.1.1.7 variant‚Äù ‚Äì Kent variant.

Covid allowed circulate high levels among unvaccinated population, still small proportion vaccinated people may get disease become severely ill.‚Äù highly doubt anyone avoided vaccination considers paper mask unnecessary burden going voluntarily start wearing mask now, CDC told us.

...and still trust CDC give sound public health guidance point, don‚Äôt know else tell you.  Maybe. think it‚Äôs soon say, numbers small isn‚Äôt clear vaccinated- whether day ago 2 months.  cares? shot, concern next guy wears mask. I'm fine either way shot 99.992% effective death hospitalization.  Well darn. used wrong tense sentence. negates experience. Got it. Lol fine Leaving relevant information statement [lie pathological sign like type lying. 

The characterization defense taking place I'm neither addressing including person conversation you, whether think I'll look bad fabrications really stir me. intentionally leave relevant information distort perceptions, making barely concealed attempts character assassination far afield.

It's *whole* truth *the* truth. Hope helped. can, passed parents children ? Well duh. Everybody lies. That's common knowledge. need specific. US higher percentage unvaccinated people UK. would hope could adjust them. Masking + precautions greater vaccines. absolute extinction flu 2020 something vaccines never able accomplish. using -BOTH- disease clearly gone. stands, lot places 30% vaccine rate. policy less science political part CDC. 

It's lost announcing wage inflation concerns stated people unemployment longer exempt job search requirements week cdc announces end masking. Industries crying people moved better jobs pay starvation wages. throwing general population wolves economy calling science, even though epidemiologists, health professionals, studies support less deaths done quicker masks + vaccines. still 3rd largest case numbers deaths world right now. true, unfortunately exactly taken. could like round unvaccinated people put trains little camps smart people could take comfort fact nobody question beliefs ..

/s take mean unwilling take medication all? hard say. top head would use dollars earned metric success, I'm sure metrics one could use. profiting *someone* else prevalent. government checking in, government probably telling truth. lie, enjoy lie. 'The Trump: Lie Keeps Giving...and Taking'

Have good day mate ^ ^ thanks telling lil story I‚Äôm Western Michigan, liiiiiieeee.

Funny though, military, motocross, played football hockey, dudes got scared something weighs 5 grams. Yeah I'm going criticize people like literally wait couple weeks ""you're okay people matter?""  definition ""we"".

Only 12% human population even partially vaccinated date (i.e., 88% completely unvaccinated). Estimates 2023 2024 ""everyone"" vaccinated. Perhaps 40 million people die interim. 

This may go faster slower depending whether vaccine patents waived. also fact public health agency gone far. Canada said following approach, Israel Gibraltar still indoor masks despite higher vaccination rates negligible cases. largely case Illinois Georgia, especially supermarkets, convenience stores, restaurants. I‚Äôve seen countless people without masks haven‚Äôt seen enforcement since early months pandemic, briefly fall.  get you‚Äôre saying sure. you‚Äôre trying tell masks worthless, seen drastic drops numbers mask mandates put place (at least Michigan case) go rules started relaxed?  I‚Äôm expert. People lie, kind don‚Äôt care. aren‚Äôt vaccinated damn fault people lived sheltered life ones think people follow rules follow deserve die. I'm loss words. anti-CDC sentiment unreal. vaccines work, folks, there's reason compel fully vaccinated restrict life anymore. Indian varent USA matter time anti-vaxers get covid. vaccines effective, vaccinated care worried effectiveness vaccine, keep masking.

I vaccinated think everyone it. vaccine, plus mask close 100% virus prevention humanly possible since vaccines 95% effective. That's belt suspenders right worried.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* never lied, lie means therefore truthful?  Flu season though!  NYT shows 85% New Hampshire least one  C*** D*** C**** Got it. Exactly. One size fits work anymore environment we're in. 2 parts state virus numbers wildly different. There's reason want federal government dictating everything every state time. international emergency, need power feds. slowly waning get better, time governors mayors decide.

No one option masking taken them. also think surprising amount people motivated get vaccine masks everywhere. felt protected enough masks, go get vaccinated. lot people want lie occur lie, go get vaccinated. doesn‚Äôt take expert know people lie... poorly thought approach. It‚Äôs embarrassing naive. Idk seems like setup. Obviously Americans going lie body would question that. weeks shitshow they‚Äôre gonna come say need vaccine passport type thing 100%. 

They know couldn‚Äôt roll federal vaccine tag using justify necessary. part yes, take little possible. fairness yeah US basically fully vaccinated, Canada far shittier rollout that's perspective, CDC guide. son nurse also knowing several LPN's, RN's, Covid still move around vaccinated, still catch flu getting vaccine, nothing like flu, vaccines work same. Vaccines carry small, weakened dosage whatever meant prevent build immune systems response essentially prepares encounter said potential disease flu, Covid, Shingles, etc... Vaccines serve collective purpose help limit major outbreak potentially harmful diseases. this, vaccines use several substances cohesion nullify effects disease, many cases helps transmission, main thing severity, give person one far better fighting chance, help seriously reduce possibility long term effects even death. transmission covid vaccine somewhat reduced, still easily passed caught. masking double masking depending certain areas infection rate comes help prevent individual person contracting something could kill themselves, family friends well. Masking helps manage transmission vaccine handles immune resistance. make vaccines years transmission easier dose vaccine, rare would like be.  ""Experts"" really like American public opinions, case last year made abundantly clear. trying jerk, must lived sheltered life truly believe that. There's literature review simply enough time people vaccinated within time frame. advice ""damn well good luck"" pretty meaningless could waited extra two three weeks would been. 

If handle anyway way getting rid masks aka using ""honor system"" might see point screwing section population made wait vaccine. 

I'm totally aware okay means want smallest inconvenience anymore. CDC made wrong call ... they‚Äôll wait end fall shit gets bad blame new variant shit reinstate prior strategy :/ though could trust people apparently can‚Äôt I'm advocating making mandatory. wish could hit 70-80% number. know someone medically unable get vaccine. relying others get it. yes choice, would better people make specific choice lesson evolution. 2021 year self culling. I'm gonna honest, actively avoid businesses require masks. want steak restaurant earlier today left told allowed without mask. almost one besides unoccupied staff. went five minutes road found another steak house, mask rules all, absolutely packed.

I part. I'm vaccinated. I'm going avoid masks much possible leading health experts country determined there's need wear one. enjoy treated like biohazard frankly enjoy told actively advised against. I'm interested supporting businesses insist making choice me. Evidently, I'm alone, I'm happy see that. shit. think administration gave told everybody whatever. Agreed. should‚Äôve tied percentage vaccinated. 

Well listen actual cdc guidance though say mask mandates call. hope govt business leaders smart thing keep masks hit certain percentage. [Pfizer COVID vaccine OK‚Äôd ages 12 ones lie immoral, self centered bunch deplorables disgrace country. That's break cases. covid vaccine chance death almost 0%. millions people vaccinated US, 223 died covid. vast majority extremely old.    agree sure. drastic measures prevent spread. 

The timing still seems funky. People getting sick November, knew COVID virus spreading early-December, didn‚Äôt lockdown January 23rd. feels (not scientific, know) lot sick/dying way many Chinese family members live within house least often return family house working. Wuhan city 11 million, seems based spread saw countries within timeline known spread. 6 foot rule applies droplets coming mouth breath talk. Within three feet you, droplets dropping floor gravity. doubled distance 6 feet. makes sense.


The science almost year covid travel droplets, also aerosolized, traveling much smaller water particles emitted us. Particles easily subjected gravity drop floor within couple feet. Aresols droplets two different things.


Edit: Forgot word Experts? [THE PEOPLE SAY THEYLL great source information! üòÇüòÇüòâ believe orange Muppet legally US election you‚Äôll know fact they‚Äôre going tell truth vaccinations would make asshole? That‚Äôs Darwinism work. Yeah, low grade headache come go last two weeks second vax. Hopefully now. I've saying response lot posts getting shit it. think reason heavy, heavy contingent people want keep things make social awkwardness ""normalized"" around. Plus ""doompillers"" news poisoning actually like afraid/outraged regularly.

The science changed. CDC finally read damn room. bet 49.999999% people involved decision making process pissed it.

Remember, people telling us we're going die eating steak turned dried tasteless puck 165 degrees. Statements like political, medical. reduce trust ""her haw muh truck "" crowd. 
Imo avoid wading issues like race. real True Scotsman situation. 

I wore masks whenever went out, distanced, used hand sanitizer, shook head grown adults mental breakdown business said ""hey please wear thing, company policy."", yet apparently *really* wearing masks I'm holding onto mask dear life like security blanket. 

At end day, that's really about. Masks offer *emotional security* vaccine doesn't, mask physical thing hold touch. vaccine, even though VASTLY superior protective thing, something nebulous that's swimming blood intellectually imagine. feel like armor wear mask, like knight riding battle plate mail. 

It also allowed neat tribal categorization: maskers, anti-maskers. good guys one side, bad guys other. idea could fully vaccinated ""good"" person wore mask go life without one affront some, betrayal Tribe. I‚Äôve past three days, everyone wearing mask. I‚Äôm Georgia. went Target, Kroger , boba shop. 
And everyone minus couple people wearing masks. 
Are stores enforcing people really sticking this? 
It doesn‚Äôt bother actually makes happy don‚Äôt plan wearing mask anytime soon This.

Part shitshow early pandemic response seemingly dishonest mask messaging. much that(not all, some) born decision founded mistrust public?

The questions *this* story circle around thresholds: many people would dishonest kind effect? people vaccinated continue wear masks whereas non-vaccinated continue wear masks like they've done whole time Remember, someone lies vaccinated lie bitten zombie. Huh, literally heard epidemiologist say newscast last week, characterizing risk achieving herd immunity, perhaps misunderstood.

It‚Äôs also fairly tautological. strain virus, new virus. There's reason vaccines effective. want say friends saying ‚Äúbut unvaccinated people lie!‚Äù guess CDC could never taken possibility consideration! thought two seconds, there‚Äôs way they‚Äôve thought weighed pros cons. we‚Äôre going trust science, trust scientists, too. daughter turns three week I'm expecting going easy peasy moving forward. vaccines temporary too. they‚Äôve always done dangerous diseases didn‚Äôt mask mandates. 

It‚Äôs fair expect 99.9% almost perfectly protected keep wearing masks they‚Äôre not. 

We got vaccinated reason. We‚Äôd like actually live like are. also effects disabled people greatly, heard 6 10 deaths people considered disabled...

Young disabled people around effected too, wish commonly spoken numbers 12 15 year olds finally making impact.  varied state. state certain immune compromised people could get early, like people whole organ transplants. kids people medical conditions can't get vaccinated? protect them? Common sense alone says people lie..  Doesn‚Äôt former positive test mean antibodies? trying get people back normal spending consuming habits. anybody else say shit sherlock? I'm even expert tell that. People absolutely gonna lie. medical condition severe enough prevent getting mRNA vaccine, probably playing Russian roulette stepping outside, let alone working Walmart.  article prove transmission vaccinated people. might gone dinner caught unvaccinated waitress, example.  Goooooood  work. right die working retail setting pregnant.  Let lie, vaccine available.
If want it, thats choice.
You made decision adult, live consequences. get Covid suffer serious reaction one blame yourself. think know much me, think okay throw caution wind virus killed millions within year. still data future complications still variants showing up. I'm waiting vaccine kids 12 completely relinquish masks. Hopefully happen year. ‚Äúexperts‚Äù people existed Earth 5 minutes? That's said all, that's want believe there's nothing that. makes difficult hard hearing live normally. Worth pandemic, incredibly annoying rest time. Hmmm... name checks out... people going chemo taking certain immune suppressive wait they‚Äôre done course immune system recovers enough get vaccine. also potentially vulnerable even fully vaccinated immune system may respond well vaccine. I‚Äôll lie. already COVID doctor advised get vaccinated autoimmune disease have. Fuck it. eat, yes, must taste like bacon üò® isnt need so. 15% old people die covid. 1% adults do. .0002% kids die. nothing thought one joke large number genders, person identify things genders

this shows least two jokes And? We're supposed accept another violation privacy? states mask rules. Many Americans already going maskless regardless CDC said. thought Covid months. Except global pandemic one arguing it. good care enough (seemingly only) yourself.  get vaccine lol. people can‚Äôt severely allergic. thought used one stadium state-wide haven‚Äôt states picked up?

Because vaccine passes new political third rail. political towards actually instituting them. Republicans ones anything regards them, ""banning them"". Democrats instituting mandates them.

I know ever **need** go business location requires them, I'll waste time Covid test opposed disclosing information want disclose. mean 1% population that's vaccinated meaning nurses doctors whatever else allow people need most... I'm sure. Unchecked spread virus among deniers potential hurt everyone, people, virus repeatedly evolved lethal transmissible. 

What happens achieves immune escape? sudden, nobody safe new vaccine designed, tested, distributed. Every new case signifies countless instances viral replication, every one opportunity virus learn new tricks.

Do want pandemic? unchecked community spread get pandemic.  That's correct, people immunocompromised recieve covid 19 shots safely. part ""all peaople"" unclear you? COVID vaccine live virus can't hurt immunocompromised people.

&amp;#x200B;

Kids 12 basically zero chance severe illness.  virus taught anything, lethal virus come along point, people reaction COVID, hundreds millions die.... Lmao wonder ü§î Small world  lie virus, lie vaccines. 1 : 1 think underselling reality saying vaccinated mask distance spread zero knowledge matures. reality quite likely many years away end COVID marked threat due vaccine uptake. based lack knowledge virus, even full vaccination. whole thing feels suspect. Again, reasons choice. Meaning can't, perhaps medical reasons. American adults ample time get vaccinated.

This wrong. course it'll receive authorization risk-benefit still favors vaccination. 
We universal vaccination polio, disease eradicated couple countries seen US decades. Murphy make announcement Memorial Day we‚Äôve hit 70 percent adults vaccinated 60 percent total population saying getting rid restrictions except pertaining kids, public transit, government buildings, etc. Hell say we‚Äôre getting rid restrictions 2 weeks something like barring reversals positive trends allow local municipalities maintain restrictions want. mid late June like said guess has, *people*. \#TRUSTNO1 People spending hundreds dollars forged vaccine card instead getting vaccine free. course they‚Äôll fucking lie vaccinated. beat earnings expectations, year year earnings still way down. Look pre-dempanic earnings compare those. slightly less poorly expected to, earnings numbers put quite low huge company. That's gave freedom back customers. Tremendous economic benefits receiving international visitors e.g. tourists, students.

Major economic social costs avoided due lockdowns international state boarder closures.

Societal benefits Australian citizens permanent residents able freely return Australia. 

People able make travel plans confidence travel increases family &amp; business links improve.

Where travel even possible, avoid large delays associated limited flights need quarantine. 

Avoid individual's worries next outbreak occur whether family friends become infected bad outcome.

These quick thoughts. time could identify more. 

At start precautions needed, came considerable cost, financial cost. stay longer absolutely necessary. 

And key needed vaccination. Surprisingly, live central Indiana vast majority store patrons still wearing masks. I‚Äôm vaccinated going go maskless CDC confirmed guideline.  recent update mask guidance creating incentive opening new age group we're going see daily vaccinations go back mean technically makes sense covid leading cause death since couldn‚Äôt go anything country world may get us killed I‚Äôm sure bunch people stopped pervious big killers like eating smoking since things play death would drop cancer obesity deaths assume. really isn‚Äôt surprising covid leading death. mean I‚Äôm sure driving top ten death pushed way back since one driving. ask everyone miss using stats it‚Äôs kinda annoying cause know anti maskers/vaxxar lying also sort facts seem disingenuous too. 

Personally opinion wear mask. Go get shot don‚Äôt insane amount reservation pit stomach. also know everyone lying least disingenuous. sucks. Yeah, they're continuing wear masks social distance. think they're hyper cautious virus, vaccine, everything. figure they'll feel safe enough vaccine around time people getting boosters.  employees want protected, get vaccinated. strongest protective measure existence, excluding complete isolation humans.  CDC put kids lives danger anti vax. CDC waited another 2 months so? rush? proof vaccination going reinforced? incentive undecided get shot. Clearly lock forever 

And strawman! Mask mandates mean lock down! never gone sub holy shit, pure cancer. wait 2 weeks next wave? want people suffer vote republicans dont you? saw guidance initially come out, thought initially directed general public government policy. seems governors (looking Hogan) used opportunity drop mandates, agree there. Hey thanks checking :) ! Super thoughtful yeah everything turned fine end.

Ended passing eventually, slept in, lil achey headache next day manageable, completely good today. Puking sucks, haven‚Äôt puked years, forgot much sucks lol, also knew body reacting good thing long run.

Overall, feels really good vaccinated get ready next step society‚Äôs life hopefully soon. Thanks checking enjoy Sunday. gonna buried. predict another ""wave"" covid infections people lie vaccinated. another lock down, mask mandate, people die fucking shit Now, would give idea?? that? Reality says otherwise. Last checked science based factual data. ever opinions pieces get facts from. shocking, local schools high academic requirements nursing school applicants. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 0% cases covid require hospitalization occur vaccinated individuals. point area everyone opportunity vaccinated level 16%. I‚Äôm going stop feeling bad people soon start shrugging saying choice Yeah

We're reaching tipping point time say ""look, society needs move time get vaccinated"" push fence sitters going logic, seems like vaccinating necessary. agree scientists agree (as mentioned) everywhere talk it, get bad feedback downvotes. concerning.     downvoting Guardian?? think needed ""experts"" figure out. point, let Americans make choice. mask policy anywhere. vaccine available everyone wants one. people want fine, choice. People fear covid get vaccine fine. fuck it, back adults responsible themselves. Yes, course already require vaccines certain things. Specifically, many states already require people administer specific list vaccines children prior enrolling school. laws *already exist*. vaccine cards show get places pretty soon? gotten vaccinated yet talked people given little card things certify vaccinated. I'm pretty sure asked present proof vaccination get places certain things. Deceptive data. NH dumped 620k doses today. I'm elementary school teacher, honestly lot times people give kids enough credit. They'll figure understand. Severe immune compromised weren‚Äôt eligible 3/15. less immune compromised depended county. Los Angeles less immune compromised weren‚Äôt eligible 4/15 50. haven‚Äôt even able get fully vaxxed yet unless able get J&amp;J ASAP Number still adults, overall new group children gaining access.  shouldn‚Äôt blame Chinese people especially US government one funding bat coronavirus gain function research Wuhan Institute Virology convenient would reasonable expect compliance taking place wouldn‚Äôt it? Hahaha, believe correct :P

But wearing mask different wearing glasses underwear me, really burden :)  People taking masks eat restaurants bars months now. still go shopping fly. don‚Äôt see people wearing mask changes anything. premiums taxes go people selfish. That‚Äôs affects me.  Even idiots know people lie they‚Äôre ones planning lie. Completely US school year nearly over, I'm sure wearing masks couple weeks hurt anything. I've seen multiple posts today people confirming intend lie. last 5 years, people shown us pieces shit be, proud it, color less surprised. spent weekend New Hampshire. Place open business like it‚Äôs 2019. There‚Äôs nice way say this, expect subreddit almost entirely comprised Starbucks employees? pregnant 2019 deadly pandemic back either. Literally every anti masker anti vaxxer going lie. 

Basically people bring next pandemic given benefit doubt  Went Trader Joe's IL today wear masks. was... amazing. saw people masks well. one gave us dirty looks. cashier even happily talking us twins twins, too. felt normal. went Target. put extra signs saying masks required. felt like May 2020 again. Vermont, everywhere went weekend everyone still wearing masks, indoors out. Vaccinated people safe difference make. Wait minute new argument unvaccinated people infected spread around unvaccinated people. stupid argument mask protect person wearing it. wait minute mask protect others infected person wearing. believe story changes much. scared get vaccine scared wear mask matter guy does. Extremely inconvenient? Really? don‚Äôt even use brand name hand sanitizer guests use. won‚Äôt even shell Germ X, forget Purell. would nightmare Target disaster small restaurants barely process credit card payments 2021. haven‚Äôt odds stacked enough already. I‚Äôm sure restaurants verify vaccines, fine, it‚Äôll become status symbol that‚Äôll die summer. Hello again, see anxious let quell concerns.

1. Community spread unchecked large chunk population protected. largely successful vaccination campaign natural immunity 2/3rds U.S population immunity COVID. That, plus regular public health measures like contact tracing continuation vaccination campaign allow situation non-pharmaceutical measures universal masking distancing relaxed. goal vaccine, make COVID virus becomes managble, elimated. 
2. COVID mutates, course does, every virus. Influenz mutates faster COVID however Flu season comes around always vaccine ready combat it. that, distance mask every fall becuase virus mangable even thousands varients rolling around. Similar flu, COVID vaccines already updated combat varients may dodge immune responses. Hence, boosters. However, vaccines made potential mutations mind, variant popping makes current vaccines obsolete unlikely, Fauci said himself. current vaccines still highly effective agaisnt varients concern, even Indian varient. Even super varient pops up, MRNA technology makes easy update vaccines could vaccine protective agaisnt varient short amount time. 
3. way get longer pandemic continuing take unnessary precautions. pro-mask pro-vaccine, also pro-science. science clear vaccinated people return mostly normal life. whole goal with? point getting vaccinated can't return old life? anxious returning normal completly understandable. However, people shamed taking unnessary precautions go agaisnt scientific research. also held captive people never going wear mask get vaccinated anyway.  Lmfao. honest american funniest thing ive heard month. Yeah worried numbers unsure many parents would get kids vaccinated. I‚Äôve pleasantly surprised far!  Except they‚Äôre not. got preferential treatment compared general population states got vaccinated said general population. doesn‚Äôt matter temporary. 

There *no* demographics (including children) forever ineligible vaccination. 99% time blamed shitty parents.

Tablet entertain chicken fingers fries dinner! Let‚Äôs honest, people aren‚Äôt wearing masks already ones lining vaccine. CDC estimates I'm reading something wrong. is, huge number cases still cause huge number hospitalisations. hundreds thousands double vaccinated 70+ year olds get virus, thousands still hospitalised. wear mask 40+ hours per week work. Sometimes even full PPE + respirator. feel like popping paper mask go buy food store barely even inconvenience point. doesn‚Äôt impact mental health whatsoever.

I‚Äôm advocate April 2020 rules end time. I‚Äôm saying broad brush statement CDC harm good, view. 

I continue wear mask indoors public, won‚Äôt change soon. think socially isolated masking times virus fully eradicated. It‚Äôs going yet, people get vaccinated safely hang vaccinated people personally know trust. 

It could whole lot worse! Imagine actually spread fomites, feared early on? would suck. found deciding go clear Wal-Mart instead closer Dollar General day knew sure Wal-Mart lifted mask requirements fully vaccinated people accordance CDC guidance 

So see kind ""why go somewhere makes mask places don't?"" loss traffic vaccinated people pushing companies make change Exactly. packed bar social distancing masking bar itself. also said another comment: 

‚ÄúI respect right enforce masks establishment. I‚Äôll go elsewhere evens out.‚Äù don‚Äôt think they‚Äôll lie. Anti-maskers would rather pick fight let others think got vaccinated. know shame so. Someone else wearing mask unintrusive want wear it, that's fine me.  That‚Äôs literally scientifically untrue.

As opposed figuratively scientifically Vaccines aren‚Äôt 100% effective especially new variants.

Vaccines also 100% effective original strain.

By large always masks protect people, yourself, unless wearing specific kind can't remember moment?  Apparently there‚Äôs something weird NH numbers possibly data dump kind I‚Äôm expert lying also confirm people lie. Try find clip Fauci Face Nation today. think said very, unlikely. discussion news broke cdc friend mine upset said people lie.

I said people lie people die. vaccinated nothing worry about. vaccinated lie might get virus die. Darwin strikes again. Win Win. Worth noting ‚Äúfrail person‚Äù might hospital time. Could hospitalised anyway covid incidental finding. Hope pull Oh no! mean idiots lying mask exemptions whatnot lie VACCINATED!? No! think trust ‚Äúthe people‚Äù, can‚Äôt. well, guess liars get sick say couldn‚Äôt? said understand talking about. pointed reasons immune compromised person may currently ineligible get vaccinated. need least 50% fully vaccinated - many still waiting second dose!

My county: ""We remove county-specific restrictions defer state restrictions reach 50% fully-vaccinated.""

Also county, upon finding state mask mandate removed also reaching 50% fully-vaccinated, desperately trying find way keep mask mandate: ""Uhhhhhh TWO WEEKS SECOND DOSE.""

Like, get it, makes sense, also frustrating see try desperately cling mask-wearing. Accurate  many subreddit. They‚Äôre waiting higher vaccine rates political cover. Vaccine passports won‚Äôt exist meaningful sense except large venues. Plague Enthusiast hide selfish nature behind ""Muh freedoms."" worth, thank one people care. year quite lesson. ""Vaccines 100% effective!"" like actual fuck argument? Neither masks, condoms, seatbelts, airbags, literally vaccine ever existed history planet earth. Genuinely argument say that? want protected COVID stay home live alone. vaccinated, simply house probably changing risk level way whatever hell people choosing masks. vaccinated btw, CDC says, risky, safe (from COVID). considerable reason believe mRNA vaccines lower incidence side effects delivery systems, seems playing real data. 'long term consequences' known, 'long term consequences level immunity real, real, real rare, really well understood mechanisms mRNA vaccines employ lend long term consequences immunity. RNA pretty fragile like foreign substance bodies never seen. novel part delivery vehicle, even big worry lipid something long term, short term allergen. 

Odds strongly favor very, safe point. Sure, 100% certainty, nothing is. Odds riskier riding car vanishingly low. 

I understand would wait efficacy data. confounding safety? may efficacious someone immunocompromised, waiting going help work well? Technically, they're right... 
but tragedy commons implies likelihood, they'll get infected somebody else thinks way   Damn you‚Äôre socially economically stupid. mean looking back post history ever picked winner stock market? Exactly, get act vaccinated wear mask without social stigma now. Okay, ever imagine world you‚Äôd happy end mask wearing social distancing?  telling it‚Äôs possible unvaccinated people infect people even vaccinated?? way! It‚Äôs almost like we‚Äôve known time states like NY CA trying account postponing mask mandate. Crazy right? wait unvaccinated person wouldn‚Äôt lie vaccinated would they?? would lying ü§• almost cult-like mentality. ""We identify group bc wear mask.

And also ""We identify group bc *dont* wear mask."" Yeah, saw that. summarized CDC guidance relied stats studies. quoted stats, without sourcing them, relevant conversation idea come studies. Regardless stats come from, appeal CDC guidance assumes interpretation relevant data superior everybody else's unless credentials warrant attention data present surprising enough credibility surpasses high enough bar I'd convinced. layman perspective sees kind data wild I'd comfortable going career experts field experience, much, much bigger problems. 

In short, saw numbers assumed direct response I'd said, point implies fairly complete trust Dr. Walensky colleagues, includes summary interpetation relevant credible data. Since response data assumed already handled them, really warrant arguing thought knew that. So, downvote opinion makes sense coupled thought room-temp rebuttal. 

Sorry offense. 

Larger point is, I'm expert, even experts level circle colleagues data folks do. rather presumptuous think relatively smooth-brain find sort fatal flaw guidance. 

On hand, totally called last spring Dr Fauci first said worry masks. obviously done order secure supplies medical personnel. Probably wrong call, again, need people hoarding them. could see similar move encourage folks get vaccine, think it'll work. Fauci's time, one/two weeks earlier masking... believe would changed darn thing. 

At point, I've lost thread argument, I'm tired. hope folks listen guidance consider best context neighbors. I'm glad guidance, puts folks can't get vaccine health reasons even riskier place, like one bit. Right, many process, people getting two shot dose takes 5-6 weeks. 

There's awful lot people \*didn't\* skip line waited turn, come till April 19th. So, \*eligible\* start 5-6 week process less 4 weeks ago.. done yet. may even halfway done yet, every one got turn first second week.

I lot friends currently process, retreated back inside get fully vaccinated. Probably cause it‚Äôs already pretty redundant article 

We already know it‚Äôs transmissible. know protection maintained variant number studies, UK still going ahead reopening plan indicate concerned really are. 

In words it‚Äôs like ‚Äúkeep calm carry on‚Äù, it‚Äôs article presenting new, important data ""and one reason totally do!""   one really wants lines outside everywhere QR codes scanned.

Well, forget actually issuing new vaccine cards everyone actually connected identity know real opposed bit paper real verification today.

They'd need everyone smartphone. they're QR codes, current cards those.

Then businesses spend money QR scanners, either form stanchions handheld employees. latter, they'll spend payroll, either hire someone new take existing employee give hours. Either way, they're spending money guarantee want to. Mother Pink Floyd‚Äôs ‚Äú‚ÄùThe Wall‚Äù: ....‚Äùdon‚Äôt trust government.‚Äù also 5 year old son's problem, since that's vaccine approved 0-11 (yet) Non experts  Covid Airborne, Scientists Say. Authorities Think So, said! New HVAC Standards... Downvote away. disagree. Masking restrictions always going temporary bandaid pandemic. 

The reality situation masks extremely inconvenient large portion population. 

That humans would restrict social interaction long(see indoor gatherings last fall).

The CDC recognizing fact best compliance going get people get vaccinated it‚Äôs unrealistic expect humans go along measures mandates much longer, especially vaccines table. 

You already strong amount noncompliance antimaskers. Throw sizeable amount vaccinated population told ‚Äúvaccines allow go back normal life‚Äù makes perfect sense growing public animosity CDC government officials regarding Covid. accidents like weather, happen

Of course do. That's definition ""accident"". Fact risk dying auto accident relatively low. people's first-hand experience validates this. That's people accept risk driving auto. Simple. subject caution, unvaccinated people allowed go maskless simply pretending vaccinated,

What mean ""allowed""? vaccinated, hell business it? risk affected minuscule. number people get infected they've vaccinated (or reinfected they've already disease) going increase well

So threshold zero increase infections? That's rational? mask two minutes grab bag Cheetos gas station literally easiest thing world

You get telling others do? Speak economically mentally I'm chilling like villain. yeah, realize there's like hundreds millions people consider. Vax ass we'll get beyond this. would fine fully reopening bars/restaurants opening indoors everywhere else based honor system far abrupt. vaccines' efficacy severe infection (hospitalisation) very, high. anything, verifies need vaccine passports. Wouldn‚Äôt solve every whataboutism argument comes every post new CDC mask guidelines? 

*how know coworkers lying vaccinations?* Show proof vaccination.

*X business won‚Äôt walk back mask mandates they‚Äôre afraid people lie...* Show proof vaccination.

I don‚Äôt get hot topic. Maybe phrase *passport* sounds scary .... feel showing proof vaccination solves lot problems people seem walking back mask mandates. argument could made 2-3 weeks welll since there's people getting vaccines first time now. 

We gotta stop point one saying masks banned. make sense shame people excited there's shift CDC knows way you. Might well follow they're experts, no? FDA CDC committee members seriously question emergency 12-15.

But vote unanimous.  I'm say make uncaring person, work way.

Should stop driving cars sometime die them? wear masks forever flu going away? 

At point life needs get back normal, might like time now. care yes shots. maters guy standing next social distances heard vaccinated people getting COVID news?  That‚Äôs great point Yeah less immune-compromised followed shortly after. 

There far non-minor demographic can‚Äôt get vaccines. matter lie? people get sick unvaccinated ones, that‚Äôs them.  recognize someone expert without blindly agreeing everything do. experts agree this. Dr. Fauci would imagine within period couple weeks, you‚Äôre going start see significant clarification actually understandable reasonable questions people asking

Have good one Right, KF94/KN95/N95 way. That‚Äôs good way gauge state currently doing. point look current policies affecting numbers ground. Especially since comments I‚Äôm responding talking recent events (within last month so). really use ableist language? vaccinated people wear masks kids able get vaccinated least? forever, children ability protected. I'm super surprised healthcare facility allowing employees patient contact mask right now.

I work one, zero patient contact, every single person come contact work vaccinated, we're still required wear masks. Exactly.  promise that's making anti-maskers mask.

I've tested it. Masking walking Wal-Mart half people masking yield results making masks magically appear faces. mean ‚Äúown‚Äù people hate? Genuinely curious Lol well giving people refuse part, wanna get done holding country back punished it, unfortunately let vaccinated people wear masks everyone refuses vaccine definitely try lie it. option Incan see besides leaving restrictions place make vaccine passport applies public places difficult forge. Right sounds likes due ignorant assholes many places covid circulating long time something could wiped everyone part. Thought onion article Then. Don‚Äôt. Tell. People. To. Unmask. You. Dimwit! Damn, exactly felt December. begged someone take hospital, truly thought going die.

Couldn't stop throwing up, take painkillers chronic pain, forced withdrawal stop throwing painkillers.

But cough anything covid like, must got flu. said needed masks hc workers. least said later on. Nothing virus feel pain. learned family &amp; friends refusing even get vaccinated (""I trust vaccine"", ""COVID worse flu"", etc). explosively confronted them, told ""need respect choices.""

My immediate response ""Fine, *choice* attend face-to-face events y'all either change 80% vaccinated.""

Only 1 friend said understood &amp; swapped Discord info still game together. Yet people trying throw ‚Äúillegals‚Äù fake paper work. person asked answer anyway. meet dumbest fucking person day it‚Äôs natural want see stupid shit believe. True, 2 weeks 1st mRNA shot healthy person 80% less likely get covid unvaccinated, pregnancy funny things body immune system, covid statistically dangerous pregnant women even comorbidities. way would gamble personally recommend n95 cheap layer protection baby doctor agrees it‚Äôs safe remove mask public.  near 100%

C'mon, man. I'm based reality? reality based ""near 100%"" means ""actually 100%""? true, know people refuse wear masks also lie don‚Äôt care anything themselves. 

The cdc said ‚Äúno one wear masks‚Äù though it‚Äôs important note that. Great point. brought previous thread, surprised people think everyone whole country able get first shot *exactly* 4/19 immune right now.

There people trouble taking work, difficulty finding appointments plenty reasons may gotten first shot late April. Like said, we're hanging people dry.

Memorial day weekend natural choice opening everything back up, looks like rushed couple weeks. Yes, warranted. checked right. It‚Äôs ‚Äúonly‚Äù 7 weeks live that‚Äôs still ample time. Plus it‚Äôs available elderly long that. Anyway CDC agrees masks aren‚Äôt needed anymore vaccinated I‚Äôll side science random Internet stranger. actually pretty good metaphor.

Because sunscreen available, everyone knows exists get it, offer someone cannot force let rub body.

Also, wear sunscreen, irrelevant whether people refuse wear sunscreen do. affect cannot stop getting burnt want be. definitely realistic think stop sun risk burning people, let's wait technology come. 'It's control!' 'Masks work', etc. spent long time reading trash comments today Facebook local county 'News' group. Sorry hear. take granted living place public health guidance usually taken seriously. least thankful children spared adverse outcomes. Including children 12 cannot vaccinated yet?  CDC calling end masking. said it‚Äôs you, it‚Äôs state/local govts. hard get? They‚Äôre even saying definitively need keep situations.

I‚Äôll spell again. don‚Äôt believe vaccinated people risk. believe public policy keep universal masking keep unvaccinated people masked up. even close science denying. You‚Äôre denying facts I‚Äôm stating. Try closer 70 million Americans mean you‚Äôre work me. Thank you! swear someone needs create reddit bot reply comments explaining wow explanations I‚Äôve seen couldn‚Äôt absolutely healthy

I highly doubt that. said responsibilty take care lifestyle. ""the right thing"" use masks forever fitness activity people walking car door fast food joint.

The right thing relative. necessarily deem right. moron knows lie. Hell, tell truth try force way anyway make scene.   Well.....yes? Keep mind places offer drinks incentive getting shot. person could plastered. considered fully vaccinated 2 weeks completed doses.

Per [the Fully general, people considered fully vaccinated: 2 weeks second dose 2-dose series, Pfizer Moderna vaccines, 2 weeks single-dose vaccine, Johnson &amp; Johnson‚Äôs Janssen ¬±This guidance applies COVID-19 vaccines currently authorized emergency use U.S. Food Drug Administration: Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, Johnson &amp; Johnson (J&amp;J)/Janssen COVID-19 vaccines. **This guidance also applied COVID-19 vaccines authorized emergency use World Health Organization (e.g. AstraZeneca/Oxford).**  fact wearing mask (especially chose high protection mask) adds protection wearer that‚Äôs pretty good protection Truly brightest minds CDC friend also getting vaccine, due extreme medical condition merits decision. depending people vaccinate vaccinated. No, cherry pick one week, look TOTAL death rate pandemic. FL much better shape NY. issue huge overlap, possibly vast majority antimask antivax.

""I never get vaccine continue wear mask protect others"" - said antivaxxer ever. bad includes 9 4 year old children don‚Äôt access vaccine yet. Guess keep masking. Please keep us updated. pretty accessible. doubt, reach online I'm sure someone could help someone care locate nearest place offering vaccine. time things gotten lot better areas, understand frustrating hiccups, especially earlier times. literally said head opening sub . . read mind ;) Damn, December around time, begged partner take hospital felt like dying, seem like covid, cough whatnot.

Just felt like I'd run truck stop throwing up. Here‚Äôs exactly means ‚Äî 

They took 43,448 people, right? Split two groups size. 21,720 people received Pfizer vaccine. 21,728 people got placebo shots. send world test constantly. see gets Covid. 

Of 43,448 people total, 170 get Covid. 162 placebo group, 8 vaccinated group. That‚Äôs 95% people got Covid placebo, 5% people got Covid vaccinated.

Your actual, real risk getting Covid depends much Covid much exposure you‚Äôre getting, general chances extremely small you‚Äôve become vaccinated. Looking CDC data interesting... blacks died much higher rate early pandemic later waves black deaths much lower races. means vaccinated ones ok unmasked. Got it. shit *Darwinism intensifies* Went grab drinks gas station PA. mask signs, cashier wearing mask. wear mine. 

Felt weird. nice. Felt like pre-covid sure, went hockey game. Overall fairly wild day. guess us vaccinated, we‚Äôre gonna see validity vaccine US holding astranzenica vaccines point? Ship every last one India. Well you‚Äôre pretty heartless then. one calling shutdowns you‚Äôre implying. mask months especially since kids vaccinated fall. Trust science course USA Today would consult ‚Äúexperts‚Äù  opinion literally means less nothing face science lmfao. Trust science honest, really sure circulation great, even newer aircraft. poo test good demonstration this. Lots air pass HVAC system, sure, little translates actual replacement cabin air. Aircraft return air vents know of, like home HVAC would. HEPA filter getting use beyond initial draw air bleed air valves.

Regarding last comment, may offer pilot's advice this: bother vitamin C. That's myth pervasive myth regarding vitamin eyesight. vitamin C megadose going hurt you, effective hate seeing people give money companies capitalize misinformation.

Also, ditch Zyrtec. Zyrtec antihistamine reduces symptoms suppressing immune system response. That's something want virus attempting gain purchase within body. best helping.

The pilot's method avoid getting sick traveling minimize contact people, get good night sleep, well hydrated wash hands frequently. Brah like 70 million Americans currently unable get vaccine, would ineffective(10 million+ immunocompromised adults friends loved ones) numbers MATTER....the death rates.

Here 1.7/100K
NY 0.8/100K
CA 0.7/100K

So FL bit 2x worse per capita deaths. think putting ""now"" caps means one would notice answer question? I‚Äôve seen people come fake illnesses peddle nonsense years don‚Äôt like true diagnosis chronic ailments. roommate back diagnosed three different doctors MS. Instead facing it, found naturopath diagnosed ‚Äúchronic Lyme disease.‚Äù suspect lot cases adrenaline fatigue pseudoscience nonsense start popping up. Definitely gonna lot people risk now. Omg...must got early 2019. Got really sick fever (I normally don‚Äôt run fever sick) doc urgent care thought flu didn‚Äôt test it. Three months later I‚Äôm sick again. time tested confirmed flu. getting flu vaccination. (Would hate think much sicker would without vaccination). good winter me. yup Thanks, it‚Äôs month now. assume people scheduled. Mine scheduled two weeks scheduled early morning day became available group 1B. can‚Äôt imagine wait people faced couldn‚Äôt schedule early. building work CVS started giving vaccines location week. they‚Äôve scheduling month. It‚Äôs shit show. I'm expert people lie

Source: comment I'm mostly worried kids can't get vaccines yet. sympathy compassion people get vaccine political ideology. know studies ignore immune deficiency? like 5 different scientific papers linked   takes people die this. Hopefully we'll see deaths continue drop time goes on. Unfortunately think medical boards US thing ""nurses anything basic aid care go ahead grant license, even they're crazy anti-vaxxer shit"" 

Because also seen horrifyingly large amount American nurses social media anti-vaxx. Much better. Look numbers school good test masks work. county highest rate infection state don‚Äôt require masks neighboring counties mandates way less spread. You‚Äôre acting like you‚Äôve thought _the epidemiologists, doctors, scientists Centers Disease Control_. Got damn redditors cocky. mean hope right saying wrong, seen sources stating that. far could tell looking worldometer, lowest recorded case count since March 25 2020. Average still higher times, still today's count good. TIL could director CDC. definitely let state local governments know. explained press. 

Now cluster 1000 different communities interpreting words differently. 

Ambiguity really dangerous here. think explained going well, think I'm minority. New mask rule says minimal risk vaccimated contract disease pass another. matter unvaccinated mask risk themselves? Pretty hilarious even Dr. Fraudie mean Faucie. 

He even said masks cause major health issues worn continuously.

I don‚Äôt trust ‚Äúso-called experts‚Äù daughter almost 4 it‚Äôs getting easier easier.  planning get vaccine, didn‚Äôt wear mask won‚Äôt wear one going forward. 

It‚Äôs choice. It‚Äôs almost understanding virus changed studied more. Hmmm. didnt even think answer one huh. say dont come store, cant shit else without herd immunity, young children want get vaccinated, can't still risk. really matters vaccine crowd fares NY times map 16k cases day. know Sunday reporting always low... lowest case count since March LAST YEAR... 7-day averages cases tanking US. light getting brighter brighter boys girls. Brains? What? No! like taste of... mean... How's *those* get there?? extended family aren‚Äôt covid deniers choose get vaccine anti-vaxxers. They‚Äôre rabid educated top colleges nation (US). wearing masks mandated order follow laws. 

They likely group unvaccinated people longer wear masks. kid well. California vaccine adoption rate high perhaps there‚Äôs less overall risk also false sense security people like still there. info whether conditions prevalent poor people races U.S.? ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è it‚Äôs endemic can‚Äôt live life constant fear need CDC chime this? Seems answered concept mask used for. Back labs!

Unrelated; heard Slow Burn podcast (was story Iraq war) Dr Fauci giving opinion possible biological threats (since mysterious white powders mailed places) good ‚Äòol republicans eating Fauci say back then. Sad people choose good bad information based preconceived political biasüôÑ   ‚ÄúExperts‚Äù  Number 1 basically updating guidance tho. Saying guidance update say kinda defeats point update. Besides state chose lift mask mandate immediately not. say still evaluating announce lift mandate x weeks. state. CDC doesn‚Äôt set rules saying what‚Äôs future guidance basically saying know 3 weeks know it‚Äôs safe vaccinated people unmask. means either see future already evidence that

Number 2 done - CDC say people still need follow state local law

Number 4 confusing since CDC doesn‚Äôt set states mask policy, state free way want whatever date want I‚Äôm camp. I‚Äôm waiting there‚Äôs full FDA approval (licensure) vaccine, EUA (emergency use authorisation) currently. then, I‚Äôd rather wear mask take something still undergoing clinical trials full approval. already chance since MARCH vaccinated. still unvaccinated get sick COVID die it‚Äôs fucking fault. September October.

Not ideal, time peak season. Pretty much message got asked laminate vaccination card. told laminate likely booster. simply announced new information public. don‚Äôt know people like would want instead. 

The CDC came conclusion vaccinated people safely unmasked settings.

Should keep information like quiet? judge CDC decides factual information ‚Äúok‚Äù us know?

Do see problem you‚Äôre proposing?

You attach whatever reasoning want announcement‚Ä¶driving vaccinations, boosting economy, political pressure, etc.

It‚Äôs much simpler that‚Ä¶they new information vaccinated people shared it. Period. That‚Äôs it.

To suggest censor alter manipulate scientific data desired effect infinitely dangerous. Lots doctors telling people get vaccinated even CDC says okay. Actually, Congress simply introduce carve-out COVID treatment vaccine refusers. deserve bankruptcy. Encourage vaccine kill idiots? people refusing vaccines continue refuse vaccines next year, year after, year after... 
 
Unless plan forcibly vaccinate don‚Äôt want it, it‚Äôs inevitable restrictions would lifted sizable population unvaccinated people. Children 12 likely die flu covid even unvaccinated. soon able vaccinated.  Children face many risks match risks Covid, like driving car. understand parent hesitation conclusion masks, potential risk thier kids. said, reason us risk unvaccinated keep prolonging pandemic restrictions. parent thier child unwilling accept risk unmasked, unvaccinated individuals they'll need take precautions like staying home, n95, outdoor events only, etc. Basically like tried safe vaccines. vaccines invented get us pandemic. that, us longer risk risk try (deserve) get back normal. virus 99.997% survival rate among healthy people preexisting conditions

Source? current vaccines even FDA approved yet, FDA approved emergency use, I'd hold horses declaring Covid cant hurt got first two rounds.   always. much common virus mutate become less deadly. virus benefit much killing host. want playing whack mole covid like flu. need law stating COVID treatment vaccine refusers covered.  father two children young vaccinated wish people would stop bullshit argument.

My kids today week ago month ago year ago. They're fine, thanks concern. Actually, they're better fine parents safe virus. yeah, wait little longer take mask crowds. There's nothing new that. already got lock man, we've shit year.

We. Are. Fine. solid post r/covid19 specifically. big difference flu pretty nasty children. good comparison context needed. kid get vax? Personally, check remind vaccinated ok. think scared lost lot people mixed messaging masks before. Yes is, yes do, yes does. wanted provide context perhaps they'd take stance, nurse's perspective. state incendiary comments necessary. feel like blame point here.  anyone 18 vaccinated want be. aren't, happens them. true all. Shocking parents understand dangerous covid kids too.


Evidence first study long covid children suggests half children aged 6 16 years old contract virus least one symptom lasting 120 days, 42.6 per cent impaired symptoms daily activities. interim results based periodic assessments 129 children Italy diagnosed covid-19 March November 2020 Gemelli University Hospital Rome (medRxiv, doi.org/fv9t).

However, becoming¬†increasingly apparent large number children symptomatic asymptomatic covid-19 experiencing long-term effects, many months initial know. still think nutty. school district mandated vaccination employees, teacher/janitor/cook used wear masks freely switch masks. CDC increased risk kids many fold. dont think anyone coaxed getting vaccinated point. people simply asked.

I would bet pressed, majority would admit vaccinated. Fuck that. I‚Äôve masked past 14 months, pretty good following CDC guidelines. made vaccination appointment soon eligible it, followed second dose 4 weeks later, recommended CDC. majority pandemic, living alone housemates, also going infrequently seeing people go out.

Now, CDC says science showing don‚Äôt pose risk others, along fully vaccinated people, result recommend wear mask.

The vaccine widely available free. Anyone get walking appointment nearly anywhere US. problem anti-vaxxers vaccine hesitant. *choose* get vaccinated. Don‚Äôt continue put burden me; I‚Äôm person choosing remain risk catching and/or transmitting Covid. Yeah, sucks small percentage people vaccine won‚Äôt effective, don‚Äôt blame vaccinated people they‚Äôre part problem. Let blame lie choosing get vaccinated. I‚Äôve done part, think I, others like me, heartless refusing play game anymore comes across zealotry. Sunscreen works people younger 12. Someone else wearing sunscreen mean can't bring kid indoor restroom grocery store.  Get vax, move fuck on. Screw kids, right? Wow, India way messed thought. Technically non-zero number children die ever stop forcing wear masks. Even vaccinated covid. 18 age demographic, likely die flu covid even unvaccinated. 

And masks work prevent catching flu, kid died flu might died everyone forced wear masks. Approximately like 277 pediatric Covid deaths 1 pediatric flu death past year shows claim false Agreed, clarifying. Hoping didn‚Äôt come across snooty explanation trying support point immunocompromised.  tell I'll doing. child around vaccinated kids parents take precautions. forms normality people vaccinated, there's still risk I'm willing take comes child. Luckily family kids age. We're really ""cooped up"". go play everyday. fucking hilarious. need non-lab techs validate statement?  CDC made kindergartners? Like real, joke? point really need clean house. embarrassing organization.  true all. Shocking parents understand dangerous covid kids too.

Question: shots work? People will/would lie vaccination status already bear minimum help pandemic would make things get worse? Next nobody allergic peg, are, get J&amp;J. Again, stop making excuses stupid people. There's reason unvaccinated right now. feel like lot mentally gone, you‚Äôll never recover whole thing.  Unchecked community spread endangers everyone. Damn punctuation, wife‚Äôs name ‚ÄúBoiling Water‚Äù Heh, remembered bought ""Everybody Lies"" t-shirt House new show! I'm tempted wear work lift masking requirements, I'm pretty sure I'd get trouble. everyone clapped. many lie...! obsessed denying claim Covid exist insist it‚Äôs government plot ever reason continue along, selfish!

I would like see date set say, Labor Day anyone contracts Covid following day vaccinated, pay bills would incurred. Let alone responsible decisions! care people wear masks rest lives indoors outdoors want. What‚Äôs annoying forced wear one even vaccinated, cases nationwide, CDC saying it‚Äôs longer necessary. kind shocked agree export much kept developed countries (UK, USA) keeping production themselves. It'll obviously save lot lives since vaccinating vulnerable people worldwide significantly better cutting deaths vaccinating 100% one region, given geopolitics usually dominated pretty obvious self-interested actions still refreshing see.

Hopefully Canada chance pay back day. (Or hopefully not, know mean) science clear here. 

why everyone talking science, linking Lancet Journal article whatever convinced Dr Fauci? ""think"" science, reads studies. studies? anyone link? think had. Worst cough I've ever took forever go away. definitely early COVID. enforceable before? called cops someone walking WalMart without mask on, I'd get laughed at. I‚Äôm virginia, Roanoke still I‚Äôd say 70% wearing masks. line area vaccinations. It‚Äôs nice able go mask free though. gives license covid-deniers endanger ~~others~~ themselves.

FTFY. evasiveness annoying. pretty much said ""eh, cares"".

Kids 12-16 got option vaccinated. solid 6 weeks full protection (I know, see lot protection first shot Pfizer supposed 2 going roughly 5-6 weeks start finish). Kids 11 option yet may several months. Last heard would August-ish. 

""People need honest themselves"". Oh mmhmm sure be.

I trust science says vaccinated people need masks. trust Jim Bob want wear mask around 9 year old family member option yet. mask Jim Bob's face solely Jim Bob's protection. mask Jim Bob's face protect everyone else Jim Bob.  Believe me, I‚Äôm sympathetic social-emotional trauma occurred. you‚Äôre vaccinated believe hang maskless vaccinated friends, family, dates, etc, thank lucky stars it‚Äôs reasonably safe so.

...but really hard keep masking mingling indoors people don‚Äôt know?  ‚ÄúUnvaccinated people‚Äù includes 9 month old Going back school emotional rollercoaster.

Being back adults emotional rollercoaster. sympathize. Nah, state they're blatantly saying vaccinated wear mask anyway.  job same. Said didn‚Äôt want panic customers. concern that, future, prohibited wearing mask. want always choice.

This first year haven‚Äôt gotten flu. always get flu vaccine, always get flu every year time. Wipes 2 weeks time, 2 weeks bedridden, utterly miserable. would like keep masking flu season because, y‚Äôknow, really nice getting sick year.

And know people claim masks protect others, true science showed otherwise various studies. Even surgical masks offer wearer protection. proof too, closely exposed Covid twice coworkers (they unmasked, masked, tiny room together) didn‚Äôt get sick. 

I‚Äôm vaccinated, I‚Äôm fine, want keep getting flu. year great! know several people like this! boggles mind. wow! many people! Well sure hell never gave us benchmark anticipate. came blue. Makes seem like impromptu decision. already know was, would guessed Eric Ding Dong anti-vax. saying vaccinated people likely transmit asymptomatically, vaccines alone enough prevent surge, even uptake high. like denies Israel even exists.

Unfortunately happen places. legit someone tell thought SARS-1 long time ago someone Asia visited immune COVID. would also nice referenced study studies used basis decision. links? Right. 

They probably aren‚Äôt independent. 

But we‚Äôre guesstimating, honestly, it‚Äòs likely unvacccinated people also likely gotten COVID, would improve population-level immunity.   Curb. Side. Pickup. undoubtedly lot machinations CDC lead announcement. Getting consensus issue like must taken while.  paid subscription site. don‚Äôt think way happens unless shut global travel (this obviously won‚Äôt shouldn‚Äôt happen ). think we're point everyone risk long since opportunity get vaccinated

Not true. states open vaccinations adults mid-April. mRNA vaccines need least 5-6 weeks reach full protection. course children 12 became eligible last week. Younger children still eligible.

And believe not, people legit reasons (health, job, logistics) get shot instant became eligible. *cries Tennessee* think really understand religious exemption is. would religion specifically states against... covid vaccine work. anti vaxxers making personal belief claim. could still vaccine passport system, idiotic is. would problem US government telling people fuck get vaccinated, personally held belief religious belief. following science...which says vaccine isn‚Äôt 100% effective. CDC saying vaccinated people don‚Äôt need wear mask...but harm take additional precaution even though fully vaccinated. Anything based science.

The recommendation based science masks add much protection reduce infection risk already vaccined-protected.

But that's CDC did.

They provided guidance indoor public spaces, recommending mask mandates public indoor spaces, leaving others avoid science succumb political pressures, de facto ending recommendation mask mandates public indoor spaces instead (by offering stance) saying ok places want honor system masking. evidence that, communities vaccination rates low (since distribution homogenous) know prematurely ending indoor masking accelerate cases. racism really.. really.. provide data based document backs comment effect people course 20+ years people‚Äôs kids still vaccinated make 15-20% population US. I‚Äôm patient wait. could smell wife, regardless whether boiling water sky blue. r/noshit   facts changed?

4 months ago, access vaccine. around Mar-May people got vaccine US. still question: could vaccinated person carry viral load low enough cause symptoms, high enough infect others (like unvaccinated people able currently). answer exist give first shot. take time observe measure outcomes. changed, no? don‚Äôt imagine am. popping mask I‚Äôm vaccinated seems irresponsible me. Stupid people lie speaking stupid...I didn‚Äôt like last administration  here. one cautious people around. I've vaccinated, science clear, everyone else get vaccinated free charge. 

The road normal paved mRNA.    get vaccine protected covid. choose get vaccine that‚Äôs personal choice. whole country opportunity get vaccine. still arguing masks? I‚Äôve heard argument children aren‚Äôt able get vaccine may get covid mortality rate children .000-.03%. someone explain end game this? going force Americans get vaccine?  assume 33% vaccinated unvaccinated groups infected.

Well, assumes vaccination status infection independent. aren't, could potentially throw even rough estimate. Nobody asking give shit anyone else. They're relaxing rules. Feel free wish. I'm answering question care. care business determine I'm company someone ineligible vaccinated whatever reason. includes children certain conditions prevent receiving vaccine. personally know people unable vaccinated, personally, give shit. correct, care.

I'm also unsure think anyone suggesting wear mask. Unless unvaccinated. People suggesting unvaccinated people keep wearing them. unvaccinated people care protecting people, already wearing masks. that's super relevant. Glad worked out! Happy Sunday well! That's true UK variant, known true Indian variant. exactly experts experts in? call normal people that‚Äôs knows Americans lie this. willing infection rate going go again. funny unvaccinated, unmasked care anyone suppose care them.  Im going anywhere acting like good go. Cause not. Im fully vaccinated, worry things too. wish borders open J could GTFOH look shitty everywhere. wanna give permission every Nim Wit outthere never wore mask, swears vaccines ‚Äútracking devices‚Äù. actually ‚Äútrust‚Äù ppl ‚Äúdo right thing‚Äù ? BIG HUGE YIKES me. DONT TRUST ALL!!! Experts say lie! Lol NEWS FLASH ‚Äîwe know lie!! I'm expert also say they'll lie. every intention lying üëçüèª It‚Äôs true, wasn‚Äôt.

Got made fun friends family quite bit last year. Even know point get back normal life. Exactly, plus look much measures add protection vaccinated person. extra layer protection mask vaccinated person going marginal vaccines effective. 

It would like technology cars made car accidents extremely rare, need seatbelts, air bags, speed limits would lessened could take risks driving. places business use CDC government mandates masks enforce policy wearing masks. maskless antivaxxers going lie getting shot asked public. 
I taking kids store grocery shopping people actually masks on. changes dont know shot. 
This singles people cant get shot.
It's fuckinhg mask, people act like oppressed rights taken them. Meanwhile first responders like shaking heads feel hopeless fellow Americans selfish. work vaccine center mother cancer unable get treatments would FDA, CDC. Coworkers week outright said fake vaccine get benefits. doesn‚Äôt require experts stinking cute! I'm going trust authority figures one, gave thumbs up. 

Moderna gang rise up! you‚Äôre vaccinated pandemic  work healthcare started getting offered vaccine late Dec. One co-workers husband got March good time, husband almost died. Needless say changed minds. think timing summer actually makes lot sense timing fall start school year. People jump planes without parachutes higher risk death! read number (it made celebrate family got Sputnik could gotten Sinopharm instead, yes, efficacy percentages whole thing), article notes scientists suspicious sticking 90-92% efficacy age groups. Also, one know developed cold guess that‚Äôs win? may misreading something. tactic known understanding full context skimming headlines. repeated source said point point. leaving 3 quarters information acting like isnt there. Newsflash: Unvaccinated people care. can't tell good attempt satire serious haha

Good job satire, thought twitter replies moment. math. 8 billion people world. Let's say half ultimately get Coronavirus, 1% die. pretty conservative. 

That's 40 million deaths. Like young children?  Never said couldn't, trying get facts out. misinformation covid-19 really sad. Would analogy wearing mask drinking driving? Can't infringe someone right cold one driving. effort *you* mask near zero, therefore feel entitled force everyone else it. Indian variant blatant fearmongering. Seriously dude, live little. Yeah, point wasn‚Äôt everyone try help them. point susceptible catch covid spread say kids can‚Äôt get vaccinated (yet) even wanted to. I‚Äôm 100% convinced it‚Äôs kill idiots. allow herd immunity vaccinated immunity wears off.  Communications person. agree data release, I‚Äôm speaking communications side it. Say step one goes plan, announcement made, *unexpected hiccup*. benefit specific timeline updates given(to ease people whatever future stages may be), Dr. Strange levels something going plan, justify risks associated happens backtrack whatever reason. 

ie- See! That‚Äôs can‚Äôt trust ‚Äòem! 

Thus making even harder get people trust/follow updated guidelines beyond point. 

Again, agree 100% data part it, don‚Äôt really commentary they‚Äôve done it. opinion possibly didn‚Äôt way suggested.  Ok? They‚Äôre also lot worse us.

Help first. Don‚Äôt like India. That's amazing. honestly can't believe we've made point. seemed impossible last year! Could pandemic handled better? Sure. Drastically different? think so. definitely got division, Trump divide country this. Likely idiotic/asinine thing i'll ever see life time. 

The federal government much authority think. governor's ones issue lockdowns emergency regulations. I‚Äôm going judge people hesitant long don‚Äôt judge feeling safe following cdc guidelines. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è problem guidelines assuming people make rational choices, country almost half electorate voted, voted president party denies science, least demonstrates wanton disregard humans. say. Science denier cars make sure brakes work try drive say Pinto new years eve around bars.  I'm trying imagine instructing u.s. population longer need wear masks going somehow reduce number cases. Seems insane me. know long term effects MRNA vaccines humans, say otherwise disinformation. See thought point. give idiots chose get vaccinated Covid everyone else‚Äôs immunity runs out. course will. I'm wearing mask regardless.  Yes, family well. 

Thanks source. Cheers! ever look relation 7 days ago almost 10k solid also know longer term issues not. vaccinated people get Covid spread Covid immunodeficient children. Therefore need wear masks.

Early worry vaccinated folks could still get Covid, would asymptomatic (and therefore spreadable). studies linked show that's case. Yeah went basically thing. 

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll I‚Äôm working home, don‚Äôt go much store, I‚Äôm indoor dining, already level immunity.....‚Äù

I ended lucking extra dose month early, already put 2 weeks condition made eligible.  Whatever happened ""listen experts"" PhD training totally support view. anything, pandemic evidence clear enhanced precautions day, last minute policy affords runway things go sideways. I‚Äôm continuing mask regardless policy encourage others well. FDA/USDA whatever, I'm serious: also That's true irritates people still acting like we're ever gonna get 70% vaccinated maintain restrictions then. Plus anti vax left surplus. There's motivation get story right ends.  8 billion us swimming pool. us-versus-them situation. you‚Äôre fully vaccinated, don‚Äôt wear mask Good news, I've years acne :) makes feel better it‚Äôs still scientists. duties information distribution differ.

Oh ‚Äúseed oils‚Äù (polyunsaturated fats healthy. lol (that‚Äôs sarcasm anyone doesn‚Äôt know already) There's know people who've said they're getting vaccinated everyone else was. Hopefully, prompt change views. Makes sense downvoted. Thanks comment agree feel like we‚Äôre bizarro world. ~60 million kids 12 (though I‚Äôm admittedly repeating article saw, haven‚Äôt checked number) ~10 million immunocompromised (though according [some number even higher) Would love hear guy say country's decision purchase pseudoscientific herbal medicine ""Covid-cure"" Madagascar. heard go look pretty crazy. 
 
He's certainly highly qualified see google wonder facepalming whole time. maybe actually slight benefit medicine haha. read study there‚Äôs also bunch kids Idaho Multi system inflammatory syndrome mRNA vaccines minority vaccines used UK. hair salon, it‚Äôs really easy half guests didn‚Äôt even come whole year got vaccinated, others eligible months us told us expect, one even shown damn newspaper one first town get (her hair looked great pic, too, saying). one guest age 16 every 3-4 months, big deal one kid mask bit longer, maybe 1-2 new guests month seriously buying fake vaccine card get dang haircut. point don‚Äôt know care people anymore obviously don‚Äôt care me.

You need care them. need hold higher moral standard. put level selfishness, makes better them? 

The way society improve role model strive be, like Christian strive like Jesus. Oh course. always black white scenario. people putting risk. Sucks zero sympathy somebody refuses help themselves. vaccinated protected, chance transmission rare case catch exceedingly low. Immunocompromised people navigate forever point, though think probably waited weeks school this. downvoted. demonstrably lied needing masks beginning, move made ""save"" masks medical personnel. also promoting hygiene theater (surface cleaning) nearly year known small infection vector. likely cleaning/spraying cheaper adequate ventilation. hundreds thousands double vaccinated 70+ year olds get virus, thousands still hospitalised.

The vaccine efficacy severe Covid way better suggesting. saying won‚Äôt emerge it‚Äôs incredibly unlikely given trajectory cases. seem months behind discovering variants time one emerges would already late. country literally completely open travel right almost everywhere. suggesting travel would literally never happen administration (even though would probably ideal) we‚Äôre fucked way matter wanted people trust science COVID before. don‚Äôt like science might bring, want changed interesting article topic. Replace COVID-19 literally respiratory illness would thing. Lungs take long time heal. Lots people report symptoms months initial illness things like Bronchitis. point variants no, long spread going US, can‚Äôt say variant damaging towards vaccine program won‚Äôt emerge here. 

Drop spread practically nothing, open borders countries also minimal spread, never worry covid again.

Dropping spread 0 almost nothing require months masks. Big deal live covid free that. clearly know exactly I'm referring running various tactics. nasty boring. fully vaccinated pose threat. 

if addressing anti-vaccine idiots agree. may harm kids 12. wear helmet walking street? lied. 
They directly admitted lied. 

Now trying lie gaslight it. waste time. means GAME ON! business people sticking nose mask time, wearing whatever basic cloth, etc.  making stink want make someone asthma wear mask walk 12 feet sit table.  it‚Äôs really big deal (with basis law authority) make wear mask 12 feet.  

We private property could put sign door says wear sign says ‚ÄúI‚Äôm idiot‚Äù that‚Äôs policy. don‚Äôt become scientist since apparently know people dedicated lives studying infectious diseases studying variants far :-). really think haven‚Äôt taken variant consideration? really think thought something didn‚Äôt? clearly took variants consideration science backed vaccine it‚Äôs still incredibly low risk. continue shut inside though. Duh? Still getting duh? hells yea! honestly, humanity wear masks rest time. nose mouth taboo. hard business really really really really wants get rid mask rule, we‚Äôve feeling regular customers far seems like ‚Äúdon‚Äôt feel ready‚Äù ‚Äúit‚Äôs soon YOLO‚Äù even though know damn well ones got vaccinated Feb got vaccinated April. 

Businesses can‚Äôt relax people do.  That‚Äôs says though. says:

 ‚ÄúWe anticipate results study available second half 2021.

If safety immunogenicity confirmed, pending agreement endorsement regulators, hope receive authorization vaccination younger kids early 2022.‚Äù

Nowhere say full FDA approval. guess see it‚Äôs available. bit early probably hangs kids dry sucks, every concern aside immunocompromised boils trying protect idiots themselves. far immunocompromised people go agree rough, time pretty likely COVID never going go away, can't keep forever. another risk navigate. Literally we've known whole year now. Nobody wants wear mask rest life dude, get weird little cross. subthread pointing still plenty people able get vaccinated (through fault own), saying there's reason care anymore precautions whether people getting vaccinated simply incorrect. Also flip side- got see family Chicago first time year half. parents vaccinated, kid sisters not. Wanna know brought them? Sickness. I've missed two days work, get covid test (its not), terrible lingering dry cough makes days unbearable. 

I'm really frustrated popped bubble point. Yeah put kid car seat mitigate that. It‚Äôs like don‚Äôt strap kid cause there‚Äôs random death statistic says he‚Äôs likely die from‚Ä¶. guarantee everyone quoting statistics kids doesn‚Äôt kids. hear vaccination rate jumped 4 percent due comment! nice work! Easier said done elementary school, literally every child unvaccinated, already dropping mask requirements. Grass green. yesterday, single study focused immunodeficiency. far study simply done. Except we're talking unvaccinated unmasked people. went 8 stores today every single one required mask. fuck suppose unmask wasn‚Äôt already unmasked? car house? Yea that's totally healthy isolate kids away others years. Good you? representative parents. parents actually worried this.

It's ""same week ago"", grocery stores full unmasked people may may vaccinated. never stop wearing masks socially distancing. makes sense world always safe. Yeah relative absolute disaster happened 1st world countries. They're still squarely ""got fucked up"" class compare overall death rate rest world. dont source showing lying then? Except we're talking unvaccinated people lying vaccinated. buildings windows open? Unbelievable many buildings windows sealed shut. Ive seen infographic indicating number days first second dose. get 2nd dose wayyyy beyond time frame affect effectiveness? disturbed based Barnett formula

Are sure this? source? I'm pretty sure straight population thing. Right, bit concern though :

Many people vaccinated, many not. Since mask mandates lifted, anti vaxxers surely going wearing mask now.

* People still waiting vaccines. Also undeniable effects stupidity. ones aren‚Äôt immunocompromised don‚Äôt severe health issues, don‚Äôt care? You‚Äôre fooling yourself. There's point trivial effort avoid extremely unlikely scenario becomes unwieldy. mean, logically would take almost zero effort wear bike helmet everywhere, would protect head falls walking, hitting low door frames, people walking 2x4s shoulders turn without warning, etc. nobody risk worth effort. 

 I'm OP originally responded can't speak thought process, mind somebody continues wear mask abundance caution, simply want that's fine, somebody wears mask believe science data they're dumb. Even worse take position fear vocalize everyone else, productive. fear they'll extend spring 2022 using flu season excuse. hope I'm wrong definitely see happening. can‚Äôt believe underwater! Wear mask shop hours. Keep distance people. Shop stores provide self check carry sanitizer you. 

Corona given one greatest life hacks ever ain‚Äôt going back. Food shopping 6:30 Saturday something I‚Äôll forever. Shelves fully stocked store myself. Similar situation live. Several people die month getting vaccine, used evidence, causality verified. ‚Ä¶ forced go outside hazmat suit sun shines people front-a$$. never hit 70%? mask mandates forever? Sorry that‚Äôs reasonable. point restrictions prevent healthcare system getting overwhelmed, prevent every single case death. COVID around forever capacity can‚Äôt keep restrictions going forever save lives. Wow, that‚Äôs shitty. Sorry hear that. really worry going hear stories like result reckless public policy. went walk park yesterday literally one except spouse wearing masks, vaccinated! really doubt every adult vaccinated, certainly children park either. That's quick kill long still works! /s cause. It‚Äôs fall, fall comes it‚Äôs another 6 weeks allow protection kick in, another 2 months enough kids got right away, waiting protection them, find Covid started addition well prevent happening way did. Hmm thought due mix body cams camera phones  I‚Äôd argue don‚Äôt fully know yet risky getting Covid turn long term.

Okay, based exactly? data suggests kids risk. Even so-called long-term cases go away within 12 weeks. exactly leading assume negative absence suggestive evidence?

If want assume worst makes feel safer, feel free so. time, ours. Unfortunately symptoms got tested. crazy thing would team make subscription service gives access every news site like $5 month, would probably buy it. news sites owned conglomerates would make easy well. there's way I'm paying every little site paywall. could making least money idea, they're making money. quantity ""no shit"" headlines rn wonder people going call suffering. guess good idea many people never washed hands please share evidence? point basically individual anecdotal. say wont happen talking smallest percentiles young children would argue actually first time good CDC actually thought properly average person thinks, honestly.

I think similar told people wear masks early pandemic attempt help hospital workers get PPE keep system overrun. 

It might make sense total, individual, advice ideal. find social distancing extremely restrictive personally. like dating meeting strangers. I'm going argue % number obviously way low, seriously think cause heart attack afraid needles going way ever get hospitalized.
Get drug relax get vaccine. Like said local doctors believe it‚Äôs performance discourage others missing point CDC says always guidance, *not* policy. authority anyone anything. three-week runup announcing updated guidance accomplishes absolutely nothing simply announcing updated guidance would have. people fully vaccinated still spread virus people vaccinated? Probably not, really unlikely.

I thought good summary studies 40 untraced cases ballooned 2000 three weeks time 40 figure stopping climb. Bermuda checking in, need take action yesterday.  Sure, problem. 2 weeks would said wait 2 weeks. history believe one single disease ever completely eradicated. Covid always going continue exist. point need return normalcy   Well racists *often* stupid. able time travel, one direction rate one second per second. Awesome. I‚Äôll still respect mask requirements requests needed it‚Äôs nice finally going back normal pre March 2020. Also looking forward office face time potluck food days! I've got YouTube videos you, interested? 30-40 min 11 younger still can't hospital thing pissed whole pandemic. People able go primary care routine things. many people die diabetes, heart disease, etc. unable see doctor?

How many people died treatable urgent emergency situations allowed hospital?

How many people died unable get ""optional"" surgeries progressed something worse?

All what? Assholes fucked stay home wear mask?

An entire wing extended family got one nurse, colleague got COVID *kept going work.* spread dozen immediate coworkers families. say jaded wrong. absolutely lie lie anything make look better. alternative wear masks rest lives then. U.S never reach herd immunity amount vaccine hesitancy, therefore asking us continue wearing masks indefinitely.

No. I'm sorry, us who've taken vaccine suffer stupidity refuse. loved one can't take vaccine whatever reason, please continue taking precautions. parent catching ""mild case"" full blown Covid case child caught.

Where's evidence this? Everything I've seen indicated kids LESS likely get severe case adults, LESS likely hospitalized, LESS likely die. [Only \~280 kids died entire pandemic (in US).

We mask whole country flu, yet ""[the risk complications healthy children higher flu compared COVID-19. However, infants children underlying medical conditions increased risk flu  believe stats show new mutation deadly point. Yes, love watching people hang onto life thread. love sounds weeping family members overworked healthcare staff. Nothing better smell morgue crisp weekend day. long political views don‚Äôt mesh mine watch die laugh glorified funko pop website.

I‚Äôm vaccinated btw, don‚Äôt even @ shite. there's problem! went hamper want CDC say? make statement based incomplete data turns later less accurate people lose faith anything CDC says.  seem want push message based incomplete data. Slightly jealous! musical festivals near hoping start dance party sand. Depends age, think. 8+ seem good better keeping masks distancing adults. Better, really since many adults still understand virus come nose much mouth. Good! Let decide fate now. Darwin 2.0 initiate!!!! shut borders India long ago. single flight. Biden made stupid mistakes Trump did. don‚Äôt see news media ripping shreds though. Fusun, Chinese based pharmaceutical company, bought exclusive marketing rights Biontech vaccine great china region (mainland China, HK, Macau Taiwan) $ 80 million beginning pandemic, Taiwan CDC ""wish"" bypass Fusun diretly buy Biontech. think Biontech do? disobey existed agreeemnt? science pointing vaccine reducing transmission large amount. UK, Israel, Cleveland clinic study point CDC acknowledges ones dont? dont matter? 

And people pass to? Honor system.  They‚Äôre hoping everyone honest continue wearing mask haven‚Äôt vaccinated.  That's first official post-Covid weekend, too. Going beer music festival. still get sick transmit disease vaccinated. far brilliant. I've worn mask every day work teacher continue so. absolutely hate wearing look forward every day get home take off. neccesary think underrate lack comfort wearing mask day Study published March 2021. might more, quick Google search:

""Evidence first study long covid children suggests half children aged 6 16 years old contract virus least one symptom lasting 120 days, *with 42.6 per cent impaired symptoms daily activities*.""

""The UK Office National Statistics's latest report estimates 12.9 per cent UK children aged 2 11, 14.5 per cent children aged 12 16, still symptoms five weeks first I'm bummed (myself wife) going feeling comfortable bringing 7 year old places (grocery shopping, incidental pick-up food/items) since everyone wearing/had wear masks basically able let go anywhere again. I'm curious case count look like 4+ weeks area; still going down, know enough maskless people full shit that. 

Who kidding, know people going lie go maskless. 

What hate people already talking they're tired hearing ""the mask mandate revised soon"" drumming. I'd feel different every person eligible opportunity vaccinated. saw interview HK ""virus master"". said - west regret advise wearing mask. April 2020.

And are: TOLD SO! many death around bring satisfaction. still behave way even vaccinated. Wow news!! articles read tomorrow day vaccinated employees go unmasked change customers effective immediately(May Sam's Club longer require customers employees fully vaccinated wear masks, retailer announced change shoppers effect honor system, Walmart confirmed USA vaccinated start going work mask-free beginning Tuesday asked vaccination status health Well still get said actually doing? believe target tinfoil isle 7. hat seems like needs extra. government dictate something already SAVE LIFE think authoritarian...hmm... government made wear clothes whole life .. authoritarian also? Go naked man... Go government. Theres also case businesses know vaccinated. even assume everyone lies, employees could potentially stop wearing masks, would known vaccinated epidemic, pandemic.

Once virus gets animal reservoir, we've lost chance eradicate it. Yes, makes sense me. Masks always economically efficient lowest impact COVID control measure. Eliminate capacity controls high-impact measures mask recommendation low cost low impact. Every expert always said masks would last thing go this. 

The thing stands somewhat inconsistent. Continue wear mask plane great circulation wear mask crowded conference room practically air flow? Wear mask train crowded elevator? science-based recommendations, convenient policy recommendations avoid raising ire government agencies (local federal). 

I've said posts guidance terrible *if could enforced*. likelihood vaccinated individual infected high viral load spreading others low. issue unenforceable guidance. Everyone knows it. Giving guidance completely unenforceable impractical bad guidance. Either come say masks gone entirely continue say masks need stay. 

At end day, is. worried personally, CDC (in opinion) lost lot credibility whole thing (by whole thing, mean whole pandemic - recent guidance). mask mandates illegal know vaccinated not? ""Parents forced care children person increases complaints children rambunctious.""  There's much distrust experts crowd ""trusting experts"" confirmed biases masking outdoor life restrictions. hope take lesson going forward. Can‚Äôt believe headline. children not. 

Variants keep appearing people think like you. 

If could trust people live society without selfish, entitled dumb would never reached point. Omg same. I‚Äôve stopped grocery delivery last months honestly feel like tiny bit freedom ripped away. didn‚Äôt really feel way height covid, everyone abide standards. feel like I‚Äôm totally disregarded it‚Äôs crushing. get people want normalcy back, I‚Äôm asking able go concert restaurant, would love feel safe getting groceries. Anxiety high. Please take care yourself!! they‚Äôre thinking that. Sure, see putting risk that‚Äôs they‚Äôre thinking. They‚Äôre going they‚Äôre normal lives without considering risk It‚Äôs hard single people well. lot go pandemic alone family, someone dating, even roommates. trying write opinion feelings completely valid. wanted add perspective eager stop social distancing masked around strangers. think pandemic showed lot people importance family desperate start there‚Äôs. isnt 100% true. know multiple people school work going get vaccinated. everyone isnt vaccinated anti-vax anti-mask. ton people hsvent bothered it. hope motivating them. Yeah, like cousin Stockholm syndrome. People held hostage long, want stop.   Airlines still require masks.   comes point need hope motivation. announcement encourage people get vaccinated award are. I've vaccinated 3 months teacher first time actually felt vaccinated hope come (even though day day life work wont change).  Yeah that‚Äôs exactly I‚Äôm saying. They‚Äôre hoping people say ‚Äúguess get vaccinated then‚Äù vs people say ‚Äúha! way Walmart verify I‚Äôm actually vaccinated not!‚Äù Mask minor inconvenience. catching colds flu past year pretty nice benefit. think desired result strategy twofold;
More incentive people get vaccinated, ripping bandaid policy avoid drawn complicated battles. 

Issue first: kind puts onus businesses diligent vaccinated leave honor system. 
Issue second: people super blindsided including local officials government bodies. 

That said...I‚Äôm thrilled.
I empathize anxiety it‚Äôs going guilt continuing wear mask socially responsible got shot soon could. Good, may lose idiots world get little lighter. Karens already wearing masks that's gonna change matter cause fully vaccinated... can't get sick cares. Every positive covid case know fine. don‚Äôt see fear. old, obese alcoholics come unscathed.... Yeah made clear decision leave AZ behind mostly enough mRNA vaccinate everyone now. Almost everyone Canada eligible week. know places, walk appointments vaccines area. can't get rid fast enough. Maybe one group significantly (and that's understatement) larger other. care  people marginalized still get covid.

Come on, man. We're talking infinitesimal chances getting sick. [April 95 million vaccinated. 9,245 breakthrough infections (0.0097% chance) 132 deaths related breakthrough infections (0.00014% chance).

As [May 223 deaths occurred 115 fully vaccinated (a 0.00019% chance).

You literally higher chance [brain aneurysm one marginalizing you. got vaccine things could return normal. Already saw lady lie vaccinated excuse mask takeout restaurant people would lie vaccinated already wearing masks public anyway.

They work, alternative getting fired.

Work place really go, know anti-vaxers previously wear masks running around coughing breathing everywhere choice working airspace think missed joke. Duplicate: dominos continue fall.  I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôll see announcements like coming up. I've never really given people dirty looks whole thing...although helps I'm area people kind wore beginning without drama. I'm sure would like spent whole time Florida something. engaging bit cherry picking. Treatment people hospitalized due COVID changed since beginning pandemic since little except throw ventilator hope best.

Combine NY international travel destination picking first surge outbreaks, boom, massive death toll.

I'd interested see breakdown deaths occurred third hump deaths November March. Venn diagram people question/dismiss CDC guidelines (and rationale them) think Covid hoax/plandemic almost circle. What? masking dropped. 
This person said everyone get vaccine tomorrow. asked that‚Äôs true kids. answer no. kid vaccine (and masking mandate still dropped) keeping world going back normal? [Not according pediatric hospitalizations per 100,000. study referring to? lot us won‚Äôt allowed unmask work it‚Äôs relatively ‚Äúnormal‚Äù unmasked public, even though easy provide proof vaccination. Many states stopped reporting Sundays (some stopped weekends general). However, applies last Sunday‚Äôs 25k well. low numbers fantastic, steadily decreasing 7-day average even better. J&amp;J dead virus. Modern Pfizer use mRNA, basically instructions watch for. dead COVID virus all. never shortage masks lived. indeed bad outcome, ruled moment.

That way negate saying above.

1) Idiot claims B (true statement) 
2) Idiot assumes true 
3) B ends true 
4) Idiot gets covid, bad things happen 
5) surprised\_pikachu.jpg I‚Äôm glad didn‚Äôt actually toss them, might want next one :) friends excuse get vaccinated is. family already got it. Nothing happened, I‚Äôm okay living COVID-19 get get accept consequences, wasn‚Äôt bad all. lifting mask mandates California walk freely amongst vaccinated. goodness people wild Well people still wear masks. 

Not rocket science. Ask Yee shall receive. obviously know reduces chance people catching it. science saying also reduces asymptomatic transmission. can't catch can't spread it, need mask up. immune compromised. scenario plays Zombieland: Double Tap. Guy tries pass zombie bite tattoo. 

Watched today fresh mind. Yeah, odd. Like lifting outdoor mask mandate (I can't believe happen sooner)....I really worn masks outdoors unless I'm crowded area yet I'm seeing people wearing there's literally one around them. according statistics science dont need them. problem always kids would spread older people people comorbidities. people vaccinated now. You‚Äôre going die one day I‚Äôll come two sides, first parent second someone little realistic. 

Yes, wish shit waited pediatric vaccine. kid fucking covid sucked. didn‚Äôt experience severe symptoms, knocked two weeks experienced stomach pain month. 

As realist? knew never going happen. hope along we‚Äôd push herd immunity drop mask mandate. hit 70% vaccinated would felt pretty safe life going kid wasn‚Äôt going get (or others). 70% vaccinated, plus people already previously infected felt like pretty safe bet. 

What happened last week? I‚Äôm flabbergasted by. 

I‚Äôm vaccinated, basically entire family minus couple young family members (including daughter). part I‚Äôm worried, worry ability hit herd immunity now. also worry mutated strands infecting people now, vaccine resistant. 

My biggest worry though, happens putting mask genie back bottle unlikely point.  Yes, nail salon workers often wore masks pre-pandemic, especially acrylics. No, get protection first dose vast majority protection get vaccines.

[This recent study showed 80% reduction cases, 90% reduction hospitalizations 95% reduction many studies like it. 

Also, last vaccine availability open you, means almost surely young healthy since everyone opened eligibility vulnerable first. thus virus relatively low risk anyways without 1st vaccine, again, offers bulk protection getting vaccines. Well that's absurd. always remind news created trigger us though. one reasons skeptical serious COVID beginning. convinced sinophobic media exaggerating things used media like that. sucks can't even trust news half time. ‚ÄúJust Felt like stepped R/wsb time capsule moment. heard name long long time. leader Popular Party, Pablo Casado, returned Friday harshly criticize management vaccination central government chaired Pedro S√°nchez. ""The vaccination going well spite itself, everything done autonomous communities Europe,"" Casado assured appearance media, Zaragoza. addition, president popular critical fact S√°nchez speaks ""herd immunity"" referring advancement vaccination. 
""Spain herd"", sentenced, accusing Executive ""controlling happens social networks"" media publishes. ""We herd, free people want laws protect us,"" stressed reference scientific term define population sufficient number people protected specific infection. 
The leader PP asked Government ""legal plan B"" assuring Spanish politics experiencing ""change cycle"" PP main force country. 
A days elections Community Madrid, PP gone championing freedom ""having beer beer"" ""leaving work able go drink"" proposing ""limiting fundamental rights"" criticizing Government taking enough restrictions control pandemic. 
The Pablo Casado opposed constitutional exceptionality alarm , predicted would vote 'no' event Government proposed expand who, addition, supported Ayuso's proclamations freedom hand, claiming Executive act limit applying vaunted ""legal plan B"", laid Congress November since supported PP.   article posted first said wear masks lot citations really support position. pretty funny tbh.  That's thing. People keep preaching flu. Yes, dangerous, kid's option (or rather parents option getting kids) flu shot. nothing kids Covid besides mask staying home.

When vaccine available everyone, sure. Ok. Great. Super. Sorry I'm little concerned kids real protection aside hoping immune system snuff, low risk not. I'd rather 1 family someone decided YOLO throw mask away, thank much. need name calling. sympathies. I‚Äôm assuming following protocols like masks, distancing etc? little corner rural midwest, even ordering vaccines anymore one getting damn shot. 20-25% folks clueless fox news zombies already theirs. kids several months vaccinated they‚Äôre practically unharmed virus is. 

All immune-compromised get vaccines unless they‚Äôre chemo, chemo patients rare. Hello! arm feel like got punched. time happened crazy arm work job, immediately working arm, arm felt immediately better like magic (where night woken pain arm middle night) doctor confirmed worked muscle pushing vax quicker acid muscle helped well worked out. advice go bed early arm work outs (push ups boxing case carry heavy af camera cranes 2 hours after) you‚Äôll feel better quicker better recovery. Thank much part üíï   There's pretending, numbers lie. like say. Morons published data. good reason continents would get vaccinated. might isolated villages challenging get access. isolation helps suppressing covid19. would worry much. 

Distributing free vaccine much cheaper dealing new variants.  C'mon, man. saying administration thier bag tricks, waiting marginally bad week, what, bump overnight favorability ratings? working them? Prepare pie da face repeatedly brainiac. can‚Äôt transmit sunburn others. Ah yes, 'watch YouTube video'. must far right conspiracy theorist. plenty material read likely kids get COVID affects them. minuscule. link think. issue long believed particle size 5 microns long lasting, airborne particles.  Instead particles 100 microns remain air hours. new deadly variant isnt matter if, matter when. Florida didn‚Äôt get exposed virus significantly later. trying pretend obvious, hugely relevant fact isn‚Äôt fact?

A cancer patient might fine got cancer. doesn‚Äôt mean refer pre-cancer health every time want insist they‚Äôre fine. No, Florida doesn‚Äôt get pretend good job riding clock. We've enough time get vaccinated. want lie go without mask must accept fate. die, like smokers die cancer. don‚Äôt live perfect society expect lol. It‚Äôs 99.9% though. 10 million adults US immunocompromised. like 60 million kids 12 study like day new CDC guidelines survey researchers large stated agree CDC decision.  administration ruining word 'science'. Errrrm excuse me, whataboutism detected, argument invalid. Sweden ok, actually exactly CDC telling us it‚Äôs okay stop wearing them? loaded question honestly would like know. Yeah, people told year need avoid virus costs, vaccines, way keep people dying spending days weeks hospital. vaccines here, job us. Even one shot, you‚Äôre much likely mild case catch COVID. People got remember restrictions, lockdowns, masks always keep people dying hospitals overwhelmed. Eradicating COVID never consideration, that‚Äôs probably even possible point.

Being told infection isn‚Äôt big deal anymore foreign weird people. That‚Äôs beauty vaccines.  Efficacy relative based similar groups vaccinated people vs placebo group. wearing mask increase absolute risk impact efficacy. shit‚Ä¶ shut much hoax

Wait people actually say this? Uh, they're still running clinical trials kids approved use kids yet. Japan‚Äôs leadership deep now, don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre going back out. It‚Äôs Japanese people show solidarity attending Olympics, make leadership lose face broadcast images empty stadiums. Haha. explain used ad hominem? differs place place. Texas, everyone 16+ eligible vaccine since March 29. point, point near future, adults aren‚Äôt fully vaccinated situation due lack trying. I‚Äôve hearing lot people‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs double edged sword yeah, want people trust vaccine, hand, people already weren‚Äôt masking aren‚Äôt likely gonna get vaccine.  kind agree, point publicly loudly rubbing effort keep conscience soul right nothing else. don‚Äôt feel bad, still abide ‚Äústupid games, stupid prizes‚Äù- see Covid denier start talking getting Facebook I‚Äôm gonna say ‚Äúbless heart‚Äù move lol sad think hide virus. Perhaps rest planet gain herd immunity fast enough protect them, countries took ""let's ignore it, go away"" approach (think Sweden India) regretting now.

They limited amount time get vaccinated hits Haiti population. Sadly, think necessary, want spend money.

""So Gautier fairly sure Haiti dodged COVID-19 bullet.""

According Deepwater Horizon, ""Hope strategy"". How? Yeah ""I know"" woulda much better answer, guesses. least Dr end explained know, still. 13 year old required tell name birthdate vaccinated. proof age required. expect quite desperate parents getting younger kids vaccinated since kids don‚Äôt drivers licenses. that's hesitancy sort. actual anti-vax portion even smaller great hear. probably similar us too. [Here's another, helps] 

First dose plus weeks time showed 80% reduction cases, 90% reduction hospitalizations, 95% reduction deaths. File one ‚ÄúDuh Doy‚Äù Government agencies rely self-report employees whether received vaccine. Employees may motivated report vaccination avoid chosen assignments would expose people Covid. Insurance double premiums (without legitimate medial reason) choose vaccinate. They've buried references time search bit here's npr article refers it:  U.S. health authorities long maintained face masks reserved medical professionals patients suffering COVID-19, deadly disease caused coronavirus. CDC based recommendation fact coverings offer little protection wearers, need conserve country's alarmingly sparse supplies personal protective equipment. vaccine card? 

Yes: ok good go. 

No: Get f go get vaccinated. I‚Äôm still going post history chief right answer one knows. function behavior, vaccines used, effective countermeasures contact tracing are, time year, many people already infected. answer truely different different places. 


Still, yeah 70%. high quality information, explain Uh, state fucked March April, finally started going back normal last weeks.

Literally highest numbers ever late March early April. going miss getting sick year. Used colds month. Yeah could see would feel alot better said dont know we'll take internal poll something spitballing percentages really freaked out. won‚Äôt let post link shared many times sub, today, May 16, US reported 17,834 new cases SARS-CoV-2, lowest single day case count since March 25, 2020.

After year perpetual bad news, feels nice know finally side this, thanks amazing speed vaccine development extraordinary efficacy. US‚Äôs average number daily new covid cases declined 25% past 7 days alone (from 41k 31k), almost 56% since April 16 (71k 31k), one month ago. current rate decreasing cases holds, US reporting 10,000 new cases covid per day end May. would decrease 95% since January peak. VACCINES WORK. truly wish brain worked like that, honestly brain always tells cold hard truth üòì Lol wearing mask big deal all, vaccinated also plan continue wearing masks covid cases area go single digits, even chance infecting someone nearly impossible bother risking it. vaccinated mean can't still contract spread covid lowers chances greatly makes symptoms far less severe, meant would probably asymptomatic even infected. really give shit unvaccinated unmasked people. die, die. One happen uncontrollable circumstance, unvaccinated also refuse wear mask, problem. Duh. vaccinated get exposed virus, experience almost symptoms, transmit immunity covid gets free booster. worry unless around kids, put mask them. going fine. they're guessing, reason carry weight? (My guess result politics forced science; also worth considering many CDC employees acting glass scientists) shoes shirts. :) Same. said Covid hoax never patients Covid hospital works at. smaller suburban hospital. divert suspected Covid patients larger urban hospitals screen patients coming facility. likely Covid patients making past ER screened diverted elsewhere.

Actually, well within company's right enforce mask mandate inside establishment, choose. Kind like ""no shirt, shoes, service"". I'd explain incredibly disingenuous comparison, something tells already know. care. get really sick woke white person preaching yet comes it, white people, least state, chose protect minorities. Oregon chose vaccinate teachers, predominately young white, essential workers like grocery stores (more POC) seniors outside nursing homes (more POC). cause wealthy white people want kids back school asap studies showed POC not.

It's talk action. still catch train vaccination needs applied every years is. DFW Texas things mostly stayed Abbott lifted mandates establishments required them. It‚Äôs last days I‚Äôve seen places stop requiring employees customers, presumably due CDC announcement. knowledge evolved. always sure outdoor transmission rare. following guidance time, damn right policed. could impact public health. OTOH one hurt people continuing mask. agreement mask mandate lifted early, honor system never work US, many shitbags. got J&amp;j two factors, recommended CDC effective two lazy want schedule multiple appointments. really feel children. put really shitty spot. correct answer. 

Social media internet equivalent 2 day old fast food Yes, are. vaccinated dropping masks means everyone will. main purpose protect others you. matter six weeks.  see doctor? Look, definitely bit reactionary original comment apologize that. Truthfully, I'm parent yet, can't even imagine like, I'm judge another's circumstances. guess thrown idea everyone concerned others, reality, taking necessary steps protect loved ones, without worrying neighbor doing. young nieces nephews degree understand extra precautionary steps taken, based I've seen stories I've read, personal belief young children dying experiencing complications COVID compared *traditional* diseases, including flu, measles, chicken pox etc. Kids incredibly resilient.  Wow, lowest number deaths yesterday since mid-March 2020. Lower average daily deaths 1957 flu season US.

We're officially sub-apocalyptic flu season territory baby!  vaccines aren‚Äôt 100% variants 75-90% best

There millions vaccinated people get sick die others refusing part 

Not sure ‚Äúwhy care others vaxxed‚Äù stuff taking off. care health health around me, care fellow man. It‚Äôs sad see lot needless death illness selfish This! supposed 17 month old can't get vaccine young mask? Guess keep locked house approve vaccine üò° getting comfortable enough bring stores parks vaccines masks trust unvaccinated people keep masks new guidelines. I'm vaccinated I'm already protecting illegal strongly encourage never shop business requires masks time. He's adamant facts facts lol didn‚Äôt. releasing mask mandates within window half adult population isn‚Äôt even eligible second dose.

I‚Äôm pro vaccine that. vaccine passports stupid ask US environment.

Yay!  child compromised immune system still highly susceptible disease,

A child compromised immune system highly susceptible disease. That's parent manage risk, always been.

""All kids"" danger move. immunocompromised children danger mask guidance revised. really hope happen gonna real danger, way higher Covid could ever Ugh don‚Äôt remind me. 

I wanna see / meet coworkers (I started current place middle things) office building location blows lol cant see anywhere counts gardens walk house get garden? idea that?

So theoretically could 20 people party long everyone remained garden throughout?  I'm surprised seen stores put hard date several weeks order provide time on-the-fence employees go get vaxxed. know people waiting confirm safety issues* vax felt fine everyone wearing masks. 2 weeks ago, bet many/most people would confident thinking masks would remain summer.

Yes, technically vaxxed take masks off, everyone knows many unvaxxed lie simply care.

*I think safety issues vaxxed now, plenty people 100% sure. Jeopardy buzzer sound

""Who Joe Biden voters?"" take enough xanax, give sufficient time kick in, gonna capable responding much all, let alone violently. taking small dose, close needle time. you‚Äôre vaccinated, doesn‚Äôt matter, employer power set masking requirements and/or verify vaccination status. Obviously. someone who‚Äôs fully vaccinated, don‚Äôt know CDC suggesting masks bad thing...it‚Äôs going really affect vaccinated, unvaccinated. Plus, cloth masks people use low efficacy rate anyway, around 26%. you‚Äôre serious getting virus, research masks actually effective.

My point is, someone unvaccinated, you‚Äôre vaccinated, shouldn‚Äôt concern. you‚Äôre vaccinated whatever reason, research masks effective continue wear mask. Yet reason Twitter still arms this. get vaccine then? know there‚Äôs still chance get Covid, vaccine supposed get us back pre covid normal keep us hospital get covid. don‚Äôt like articles trying persuade us keep mask mandate vaccinated folks. got vaccinated reason deserve normal again. Source? weeks state anyone could get shot wanted. first shot 3.5 weeks ago, crowded. Last week way empty.

People want shots get time able last weeks. heard anyone say want wear mask something *over there.* literally inventing something offended by. dad's cousin health issues qualified early vaccine. refused reason, caught covid, hospitalized, quickly declined died. 61.

My brother still refusing vaccine. inane reason gave mom, ""if broken, fix it."" Just...what??? Tried giving info safety vaccines, work, bringing least get protect vaccinated poor health grandparents, nothing works...the stupid, hurts That's sun actually hurts children. Yep, drive half hour nearest supermarket curbside pickup buy groceries adults could claim mask exemption, parents refused mask pre-highschool aged children public felt unnecessary burden masks since Covid little effect children. curbside pickup, home delivery, making without, us living areas without mask enforcement parents mask children got fine could vaccinated want risk exposure unmasked people stores. We've done crazier stuff. I'm expecting next year definitely within lifetimes possibl mean, work them, right? many able convince get jab? weeks ago saw NP said probably irritated rest, it‚Äôs improving six weeks complete rest taking spin flight attendants asking me:"" surgeon?""  cause mask early Feb 2020.

Awareness level low.

I'll keep time, thank you.   Put tiki torch away, jeez. understate it. Solving problems long way off, pipe dream. always subset people fully protected.  know people would complain debate employees door. sounds great would greatly slow process getting stores. local stores stopped counters door long time ago took much time employee effort. look actual studies. Lots perfect condition particulate studies, lots modeling, lack real world studies.

Look control group #11, #45 general smarter approach would telling everyone need 50% population receive least one dose first. time 46%. Honestly let suffer. refuse get vaccinated get covid sympathy you. lol k recommend drugs due single kidney outside Xanax (which tried) 

Getting drunk obvious big reason, look kidney enough take care it

Already told could possibly get vaccinated don‚Äôt seem want them, it‚Äôs happening

Regardless lost credit decided resort fear mongering pages pages pages documentation [website detailing sure advice answers looking found page, [public statements CDC wild? Previously infected people statistically similar protection Wow lol. fault others aren't. massive testing positive rate high, personally think initial success benefitted animosity towards China island. 

I'm pretty certain idea talking about. initial success due standard procedure [developed SARS followed procedure diligently quickly first reported. public's well trained informed. That's didn‚Äôt put restrictions Southeast Asians like Chinese India COVID variant spreads SEA catch way.( There‚Äôs lot SEA migrant workers Taiwan)

Their quarantine restrictions everyone else, Chinese SEAsian whoever. India variant reported yet. 

Come on, stop politicking cockamamie bull   one, please link it. check sources to, agreed masks effective wasnt worth dragging point further. timeline J&amp;J vaccine getting approved younger kids? Mostly convenience purposes youngsters (single shot vs return booster shot much easier ask kids) also like idea ""traditional"" vaccine formulation instead mRNA tech. Source? long debate approving vaccine teenagers reason. risk age group low justification approval prevent community spread, rather keep kids healthy. It‚Äôs important remember they‚Äôre trying reach anti vac crowd. They‚Äôre trying reach average rural American viewpoints ‚Äúwell, effective wouldn‚Äôt wear masks it‚Äù. Ted Cruz Rand Paul pushing wasn‚Äôt effective wouldn‚Äôt need security theater. crappy senate hearings - right. Dr. Fauci great response focused worried variants found vaccines effective current variants exist. 

As science, could change tomorrow. DOH! I‚Äôm right you. Flew Caribbean end 2019 honeymoon. family child coughing lung whole plane ride. reason family stayed plane everyone else got off. Sick kid standing aisle seat walked coughed right face. honeymoon ruined days later came fever, sore throat cough. I‚Äôm definitely bitter anything. ü•∫ Okay, wear mask! Jesus Christ‚Äî*nobody* problem that. 

Listen. stop implying it‚Äôs bad thing *I others* don‚Äôt wear masks anymore. already vaccinated! I'm vaccinated I'm fine people lie. putting risk. me. According shrink friend mine, coming lockdown psychologically hard people others going it.

And pandemic [cause PTSD yeah - people gonna need help. live, hardly parents put masks kids. stores, restaurants, even inside medical facilities every adult required wear mask. times saw kid high school age wearing mask anywhere, stood noticeable rare was. prevailing attitude ""kids need masks"". parents make wear one. especially weird doctor's office medical lab waiting rooms parents would masks on, none kids. infinitesimally small chance unvaccinated child dying covid.  you‚Äôre vaccinated, care people aren‚Äôt? Exactly mean. Many people don‚Äôt want freedom wear mask, want indefinite mask mandates I‚Äôm fully vaccinated plan taking mine allowed. I‚Äôll admit, feels weird nice. However I‚Äôll probably keep one handy awhile. someone wants ware mask comfort, I‚Äôll gladly oblige.  That's par course though. don‚Äôt live authoritarian society dude. normal okay, even agree ultimate outcome. Wearing mask completely changes game basketball? It‚Äôs fundamentally different? Still great news many different fferent reasns including might applied treatment range diseases. COVID getting eradicated. endemic, policy needs align that. mean stuck masks? mandate longer. Go spread spit everywhere. Stop downvoting people informatively saying feel. That's awful position hope people get vaccinated time frame stretches first vaccinations, comfortable able live normally again.

 maybe year since trials six months since regular people started getting vaccinated ""no long term trials"" reason hesitation gets less stronger week.

Do get vaccines? Maybe spend little time trying get [your fellow nurses take rather wondering booster shot date needed.

The initial vaccine already plenty effective variants. I'm still going wear mask cold/flu months, shame. Last year first year cold flu awesome know couple people tested positive getting fully vaccinated also

Did symptoms?

If answer ""no"" vaccine job. Yeah, generally fly I'm vacation, would minimize chance catching cold aircraft? retrospect think happened lot. I'll 10 year study see water wet. Uk uptake numbers higher age groups hovering around 95%. Hopefully get younger groups well! get end hospital, yes? Yea messaging super weak confusing No. deliberately lied mask effectiveness way protect mask stocks. policy lie people ""for good"" surprised lose credibility. CDC director must easiest job. make shit state obvious Well unfortunately make rules cover biggest idiots society. 

The anti-vaxx crowd one biggest groups idiots. 

We make speeding laws protect us idiots‚Ä¶ 

We won‚Äôt reach herd immunity previous mentioned idiots that‚Äôs shame‚Ä¶  Yeah. pretty miffed Starbucks saying workers need still wear one. Boy TWO countries what's next I'd love know details .25% - immunocompromised, co-morbidities, elderly, etc?

Seen lot numbers breakthrough cases, seen much demographics. Anti-maskers anti-vaxers generally acknowledge they're putting health health others risk. letting people breathe kids?

I already take kids grocery shopping store like might pre-pandemic.

I avoid risky situations kids, that's all. reason people children can't same. news, ‚Äúshowering without wetsuit puts risk getting wet‚Äù early 2023 odds happening low per CDC models.

""Our data CDC today suggests vaccinated people carry virus, get sick, clinical trials also real-world data,"" CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky told Rachel Maddow Monday, March 29. Walensky describing results new CDC study vaccinated Americans, found high resistance COVID-19, also asymptomatic infections SARS-CoV-2 virus ‚Äì and, extension, unlikely spread people.

\-- Fortune

I believe odds higher win pick 4 spread virus fully vaccinated based real world data. Maldives? feel people situation, what‚Äôs alternative? continue restrictions masking indefinitely? 

I don‚Äôt want sound insensitive, can‚Äôt hold entire country small subset people. It‚Äôs right ask 150 million people continue restricting lives 1 million still risk, especially 1 million, vast majority aren‚Äôt at-risk group higher chance surviving Covid vaccine effective 35% never get vaccinated. that‚Äôs enough keep pandemic going  want vaccine, fuck em. think so, i'm pain 4 limbs. thinking something vascular know. rest world, reason single Americans. dumb. Kids still protected less risky things even though risky things present. don‚Äôt allow every less risky thing happen. I‚Äôd argue don‚Äôt fully know yet risky getting Covid turn long term. vaccinated person soon assume people wearing masks unvaccinated you‚Äôre worried, means wear mask.

This true. It‚Äôs also true worried really fucking silly. You‚Äôre vaccinated, you‚Äôre safe you‚Äôre ever gonna be. Ya think?!! still take two months near full immunity kick 12-15 year olds.

Guess 12 year olds September-ish. kids die, deaths already been, unlucky. Womp womp. husband manager Target got email morning. He's happy thought would ages workers least. kids 12: every kid 18 moron anti-vax parents refuse sign permission form. high school Pfizer clinic, less 10% students vaccinated. guess depends region, five years seem excessive. 

If lives area less (I forget which) 70-80% vaccinated, there‚Äôs herd immunity. 

Personally I‚Äôm gonna miss smiling every stranger accidentally make eye contact with. takes emotional energy. neutral face appear intimidating. live Florida. Went busy farmers market type thing yesterday.
I'd say 90% people **not** wearing mask. couple hundred clamored around everything. know someone, 30, hospital fighting life. know covid getting positive. believe new variant. shit scary me. 30 year olds state even 6 weeks gain immunity vaccine. right open like this. fucking right.  People waiting first vaccine point. surplus everywhere US. Waiting second vaccine maybe studies showing first vaccine already effective looking delaying booster even further. aware us kids plan keep masks indoor locations get vaccinated. risk modeling behavior them.


I know risk kids low, also 3 months away getting vacinated suck deal. they've worn off, booster likely add even protection, especially Depends. Many people demanding mask mandates stay probably lobbying businesses near them. places I‚Äôd say masks allowed outside pandemic. Schools colleges prime example Ayy nice. one first react new guidance saying ignore science. Glad changed tune. think good faith aren't. come 14 months nightmares express frustrations blaming anything find , testing waters end near political reasons can't find arguments anymore. (the good people) must stay concentrated continue push right thing trying convince Americans get vaccinated. almost yet friend article unvaccinated Saw FB - want know whether someone vaccinated not, ask election. Let lie. vaccinated less risk unvaccinated vice versa. CDC accepts karma scientific principle. People don‚Äôt eat risk starving  That‚Äôs fine mask rules lift planes can‚Äôt get mad person next wearing mask Belgian Spring weather remains best deterrent mass gatherings kind.  number co-workers openly boasting getting vaccinated longer wearing mask frustrating.   according who? Marginalized? got vaccine specifically able go used pandemic. efficacy vaccine shows safe regardless people decide do. majority people plan mask bit longer aren‚Äôt ‚ÄúIn fact, said, plans grocery run double-masked goggled least next five years.‚Äù Needs addressed mental health professional goes deeper normal shock fucking one‚Ä¶.üôÉ likelihood exposure people outside hospital environments really low right now, even protection offered vaccines much lower is, would still fine worry individual exposure events. naturally realizing fact, early-onset dementia CDC director calls mass unmasking get vaccine means see friend who‚Äôs worried catching covid are. 

I worried covid personally wore/wear mask. 

The problem ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt know vaccines prevent spread‚Äù message hard one stamp out. People adjust worldview first thing hear, takes work change mind original thought. think need look reasons people aren‚Äôt getting vaccinated. It‚Äôs inconsiderate assholes conspiracy theorists. Even though got covid despite that. That's libs want think.  area literally walk CVS whatever get vaccine now, everyone age 12 eligible now. Right, it‚Äôs possible teenagers higher mortality rate younger children, taken group get vaccinated maybe mortality rate can‚Äôt get vaccinated yet drops. idea that‚Äôs true, I‚Äôm curious is. I‚Äôd ask CDC question, since still want unvaccinated kids masked schools camps, public. 

I‚Äôm sure scientists working really hard developing vaccine kids fun. 

And mean, 8 year old kid could possibly immunocompromised conditions make high risk, right? Dan Rather made feel bad. fact they're healthy Amercian teenagers vaccinated medical workers across developing world disgusting. give people enough time. lied get vaccine early. Fuck stupid fucking country. next weeks quite telling effective policy.

I think going bit longer that. think people hesitant adopt new policy variety reasons. Vaccinated adults unvaccinated children seems like lot still masking. weird unmasked yourself, tell kids mask.


I Wal-Mart two days ago still signs guy handing masks. came fully expecting wear mask first time ever, going get guy corporate updated policy grabbed mask tossed on.  I‚Äôm Christian, agree 100%. kind religious belief makes world better. We‚Äôre 15 months couple weeks. messaging garbage beginning they‚Äôve lost people complied year. It‚Äôs time don‚Äôt feel safe public don‚Äôt go public. CDC right thing private sector needs recover year lost revenue beginning unmasked Memorial Day holiday. reasonable possibility

Define reasonable I'm involved professionally - UVA lighting ductwork limited use providing protection airborne pathogens due time takes neutralize organisms. useful sanitizing surfaces, like filter media water collection pans, open air sanitizing. HEPA filters fresh air still best methods reducing active pathogens air. course - Americans, there's hole world outside US, duh. God damn, person bio got Covid despite double masking still refuses take off. vaccine way way effective masking, dude. anti-vaxxers want shit someone

It's good thing majority people want vaccine get one. fact, want one, least halfway gives pretty significant protection well Young children still can‚Äôt get vaccinated. Although they‚Äôre MUCH lower risk covid, still die it. Good thing people worked keep children safe practiced good mask guidance then. Works me. shitty thing say young parent. exactly makes fear mental well household? concern long term health? Nothing said comment uncivil, directed anyone. you‚Äôre vaccinated don‚Äôt worry spreading anyone. Breakthrough cases shown far individuals carry little virus. lol kidding, quick reversal part - 3 days saying people still mask up. surprise, I'm glad came through, seems little flakey them. (And Target go-to store). people get viral load all

You get viral load vaccinated person, vast majority cases get high enough load expel virus levels sufficient transmission.

The vaccine magically mean get infected, rather body fights problem. like literal shield makes virus bounce you. CDC knows spread leads variants variants lead vaccine resistance.

I don‚Äôt think CDCs plan get antivaxxers sick. Again, unvaccinated people go maskless stores vaccine 100% effective. said doomsday. cave whole time? *Doubt* (oh what's that? weekend data? Mission accomplished!) You‚Äôre operating assumptions, including parents afford reliable childcare essential stores offer curbside. us outside major cities, that‚Äôs case. families SNAP/WIC needing stretch every dollar.... none budget-friendly grocery stores do. won‚Äôt taking kids store time recognize I‚Äôm privileged position able make choice. Well damn guess someone made easier people go unmasked ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø  keep things pandemic life though? Lady grocery store practically breathing neck waited line. Like, lady ain't traffic, one gonna cut line, give us distance.  mind wearing mask sometime, new virus, vaccines started appear, immunity starting grow, still new variants like virus vaccines r catching up, sometime, months maybe, years long less new variants get dangerous. know children gotten type cold illness year pretty nice. found really weird mind ""builds"" face people I've never seen without mask. take look anything like supposed to. remember Fauci saying needed save masks medical personnel beginning pandemic. remember fat orange golem ""president"" telling everyone Fauci said wear masks ever. remember Fauci saying wear cloth masks, masks basic filters, hoard N95 masks hospitals need more.

That's remember. guess pay better attention you.  NPR article says issues likely could happened diseases, never large sample size microscope before.    wrong good luck that. going catch toddler every time. possible. much reasonable try get adults adults right thing. Though seems impossible point too. I'm immunocompromised, vaccinated still protected, that's why. yes, still wear mask protects slightly. I'm upset we're 37% fully vaccinated crawling. announced hit 70% least one dose.  Breaking news: Water wet.    can‚Äôt drop link reliable data doesn‚Äôt support assertion. Thank you, captain obvious? Man, anti science attitude.

ANYTHING avoid clear result experts communicating:

Risk child quite low, comparatively lower season flu.

Here peer reviewed medical journal explaining COVID 0.48% total mortality children first year continue wear mask. one going forbid wearing mask concerned aren‚Äôt able get vaccinated yet. 'right choose' stop puts others danger puts kids danger - lot regular anti-vaxxers actually vaccinated themselves, decisions even impact them, put kids risk. Hopefully point future we'll get point put stop make mandatory. it'd take one generation become normal.  someone infant can't vaccinated yet, leaving mask on. still wear N95 (inside) KN95 (outside) wherever go. Still taking limited trips stores ordering pickups often. kid getting far help it.

And point, that's choices within personal freedoms. someone wants call destroy mentally paradox freedom choice analogy. I'm sick anti Vax group point. 

It's even idea get vaccinated, should. respect within right make decision. way talk people vaccines less intelligent clearly opposite. strikes hard nerve me.  [Wear Masks Protect Coronavirus, Others, CDC Yeah right, maybe play safe wear masks still.  children risk now? Haha comment plus one replied make sound like referring people unvaccinated scum bottom shoes. Amazing.. children yet eligible vaccines! Americans overseas? Jesus Christ. Fascinating. tell long-term side effects COVID infection 3-year old, then. they? I'll wait, can't answer question, response complete bullshit.  choice free society, protects others disease, stymies facial recognition. fail see issue.

Plus might nice reduce flu next year well. access getting vaccine 1:1 ratio. Well, messaging couldve bit better. Especially delay time build max immunity.   Unfortunately theyre dealing population good percentage hs misled long time. seems panic ""omg one's wearing mask now!!"" spread tumblr they're spreading misinformation. Saying vaccinated people get transmit covid19 true, facts that...it's pretty low. probably going to.

I mean considering site full introverts buisnesses still require wear mask inside (I went outdoor zoo yesterday actually required wear mask)...there's gonna ton damage. Except no. Now, I'll give PPE point, that's impossible deny there, Fauci warned masks? referring N95 masks. type doctors nurses need able jobs safe manner can. Initially, displayed symptoms virus, except soon realized asymptomatic carriers major, major vector Covid spread rapidly. Hence, masks became mandatory, since without easy, rapid access testing, masks, social distancing, et al, became best way slpwing spread virus could reliably give everyone tests, later, vaccines. \*Reads ""0 reported deaths"" headline\*

\*Looks calendar\* 

Yep, Monday. here. fly often, feel like times did, least sore throat afterwards. harm taking precautions. buy/return cycle available funds so. forget many lower income households afford clothing glasses, cannot afford money tied waiting refund. non-pdf version somewhere link to? Thanks much this! ‚ÄúI say, grape juice storage beaker purple hydrochloric acid storage beaker? Darn postdocs never label anything properly!‚Äù don‚Äôt believe sources conclusively said it‚Äôs essentially impossible (just suspect it‚Äôs unlikely). haven‚Äôt fully studied (hard study) aspect yet. case, us additional, say, 5% protection family worth wearing masks crowded areas don‚Äôt know anyone. Wtf point headline???? figure exactly happened NHs numbers I'm talking countries Europe speak English. 70 million people UK &amp; Ireland... kids (and do) get vaccinated seasonal influenza, though. That's part worry comes from: age group eligible shots, I'd lot less worried.

Part B long-term consequences COVID unknown children. mean, virus that's existed \~20 months, impossible really know, reports adults athletes (like Jayson Tatum) trouble breathing **months** active virus, really blame us parents concerned?

For lot us kids 12, feels like CDC decided celebrate winning 10 yards finish line. curious anti vax label,  vaccinated things supposed (so clearly use vaccines) want see data points one see leaders lift liability restrictions really anti vax? bit cautious want see data? parents responsibility make sure kids pandemic. argument convincing people get kids vaccinated flu. Haha - I've really enjoyed smelling people's breath year.    Texas clearly slowed recovery looks like lowest 7 day average (going Worldometers data) 518. We're 616 today, numbers finally started dropping pretty fast I'd expect we'll get lowest 7 day average since last March end May. That‚Äôs different. Things like alcohol, drugs etc choose accord. People don‚Äôt choose get corona virus spread around. they're saying look pissed default. random eye contact off-putting. really know explain intentionally mean-mugging everyone. exhausting that, effort required make neutral gesture. people's neutral face effortless. not.  What?!? Blood clots first thought. Lots people finding habe massive clots thru body. Essentially making physical activity impossible Agreed, I'm teaching two year old now, capable learning pretty young got vaccine things could return normal.

I got vaccine worry getting sick, still prefer working home staying home time... Thanks coming back updating! appreciate dedication really look forward posts.  Ngl want start drinking y'all's airborn spit time again. Nobody knows vaccinated. avoid unvaccinated people wearing masks, way accomplish avoid everyone wearing mask. There‚Äôs already ton precedent. Asia people wearing masks regular thing normal times especially crowded places like trains, malls, etc. amplified flu allergy seasons. It‚Äôs courteous.

If there's one thing hope comes pandemic would normalization mask wearing certain situations. hope mandates go away stay away, becomes norm wear mask got cold and/or super crowded places (such public transport) greatly reduce number colds flu cases, that'd great. last updated, new variants shown much harder children original strain.  Child hospitalizations way live site UK strain. really think CDC would done weren‚Äôt confident kids safe? keep thinking like, would ok easing didn‚Äôt good data kids would ok. motivation would have? works there, kids.

And dying thing happen. Messaging tricky. while, seemed getting vaccinated anything. still need socially distance even wear mask outside. fully vaccinated sitting field legally needed wear mask. people, giving impression vaccines effective. problem they're saying vaccines awesome, there's way verify people got them. NH still dropped like 300k first dose shots right? People water prone drowning  Damn, dull life must lead strangers masking entertaining. What's next thrill-list? Socks? chose continue mask acting like new vaccines bulletproof answer imo. Plus still carrier virus people can't get vaccine.

-Ricky Bobby  data vaccine resistant vaccine hostile?

I really know 2 types people interact everyday : support don't. 

I seriously met anyone, ANYONE, hesistant. coronovirus board, whatever point supposed be, clearly fit subject hand. talking coronovirus killing people, non-coronovirus health issues.  would say it‚Äôs safe average amount driving, I‚Äôm okay it. also leading way vaccine diplomacy. Impressive agree, company firmly standing honor system stance culture supports trusting employees. Yeah, idea explain 2yo mommy need mask anymore, still does. we'll continue wear masks indoor public places - including encouraging restaurant staff continue masking work interacting customers - *everyone* get vaccinated. 

Also, we've got little kids (and staff also teachers) we've enjoyed *hell* winter season include passing form school crud around 6+ months.  vaccinating almost 14 million people day, fastest pace world, country races protect Covid-19 advantage face major Western nations reopening economies. 
 
The ramp shots helped flareup cases eastern province Anhui northeastern region Liaoning. Videos social media showed citizens rushing get vaccines, long queues inoculation sites despite heavy rain. Hefei, Anhui‚Äôs capital city, administered 360,000 doses Friday, single day hub 10 million people, Xinhua News agency reported. 
 
Many nations Asia, China included, struggling combat vaccine hesitation. people wooed sense complacency due region‚Äôs early success containing virus others simply don‚Äôt trust safety efficacy vaccines available. However, recent outbreaks countries like Singapore Taiwan testing reluctance harsher lockdown measures imposed, bringing clearer focus understanding vaccinated help stop serious illness. 
 
Beijing loathe lose advantage it‚Äôs built U.S major Western economies successful containment pathogen, added pressure things like calling mandatory vaccination among state-owned enterprise employees communist party members. 
 
The escalation shots China -- figures National Health Commission show 13.7 million vaccines administered Friday -- means country closer target vaccinating 40% population, least delivering 560 million doses, end June.

Heaven forbid anyone even mildly inconvenienced even second longer guess. It‚Äôs pathetic piece fabric controversial country kid potentially dying can‚Äôt vaccinated yet isn‚Äôt. Though, given recent history, can‚Äôt say I‚Äôm surprised.

Screw em right? They‚Äôre low risk. /s shit?  Oh shit maybe tell CDC since seem know this! Doesn‚Äôt matter, can‚Äôt request proof medical information make decision based that. so, open door making someone disclose actual disability can‚Äôt get vaccine don‚Äôt want wear mask. Without mask mandate, store can‚Äôt decide shops doesn‚Äôt based medical history. either need say masks all, masks choose. I'm wondering else favor state enforcing. get vaccinated protect eh? Vaccines 100% full proof. take risk getting it, even small. Sure, vaccinated, statistically likely become infected COVID asymptomatic symptomatic.  

A nice little case study action recent reporting Yankee players became infected COVID recently. 8 infected players, seven asymptomatic one symptomatic.  care someone wears mask. care get treated like Qshaman got vaccinated stopped wearing mask outside legal so.

Totally OK wearing masks indoor public spaces space crowded. 

I've spent year twisting pretzel virus. hate wearing masks, hate social distancing, hate disappoint wife putting wedding multiple times, dozens things others year want do.

I get deserve metal anything, life miserable, sure.  However, least deserve treated kindly. That's all. many students lost friends relatives take seriously.

But you. Whats stupid people paying get fake vaccination cards rather get free shot.

The dishonesty America astounding. trust anyone outside bubble people. wanna know whose vaccinated decide shop stores.

The masks stays till deaths cases week straight. That's logical thing think of.  CDC plan that. antivaxxers ensured outcome. No, I'm stupid forgot wear mask first mow season got face full hell days. infections, though. usually least one episode year requires antibiotics steroids. issue that, going make lot people angry.

and dont give rip mad. way dont let 4 year old midst temper tantrum dictate policy. let stomp scream pout. shows fools way lucky might collective iq next 4 months. Horrific :( . hope get vaxxed soon internet stranger. 3 month old. can‚Äôt wear mask feel like can‚Äôt run grocery store diapers picking I‚Äôve already tell people back baby since love getting close personal. It‚Äôs simple. numbers game though. get sick warm weather hopefully better outcomes virus gets squashed less get sick later. pure speculation. epidemiologists dealing hundreds millions people, large portion outright refuse advice sometimes even exact opposite say matter principle, might need start working ways protect population whole. Yes, supporting it.  ...for Scrooge MacDuck. Well I‚Äôd start fact you‚Äôre engaging arguments vaccinated people needing wear mask. Second, thought masks provide protection others vs wearer misleading. wear masks protect others ourselves. It‚Äôs better one thing another. seems like you‚Äôre saying masks equal, case magic ability protect others wearer. magical barrier keeps droplets going coming back in. 

People question statements like that. That's pro-lifers say lol  Vaccines US became widely available adults 4 weeks ago. That‚Äôs enough time immunity. personally believe CDC announced would start June 1st something, 6 weeks mass availability, order give everyone time become vaccinated first (or chose get vaccinated, get vaccinated lifting restrictions). Either way, still soon, especially amount people unvaccinated. vaccinated people safe, anti vax also likely anti mask, actual way checking. loving gas shortage unfortunately story fizzled pretty quickly. Trump says he‚Äôll rallies get closer 7-4, yay, get culture war stoked again. Maybe it‚Äôs me, haven‚Äôt seen people really argue guidance, surprised it, wondering many choose go maskless without vaccination, it‚Äôs good call social level, necessarily science level. I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs people want argue this‚Ä¶ usually are.  Yeah like wear mask stores transit ever anything else like concert, go bar/restaurant still getting exposed flu things... that's mandate drops wear anymore. get sick get sick. Clearly topic far complicated discuss here; isn‚Äôt 100% accurate. freedom govt tyranny, also sense need united maintain freedoms tyranny others. 

The founding fathers different perspectives anew democratic govt would look like. less dictatorship, libertarian oasis. roles play private industry, free people‚Äôs, governments. 

To say country founded individual freedoms wrong, could interpreted libertarian, wasn‚Äôt. Might well take easy precautions increase chances don't. Aah. experience limited clean rooms, things going irradiated 15 seconds minute, reading aerosol infectivity studies mice. Thanks explanation! means antimask. said, kids public make nervous, putting much faith masks. kids still wear masks. Even mask mandate community abided wear properly. least pretence safety. I'd love see adopted US. body affected comes vaccines, prevent others getting sick too. don't' think bodily autonomy arguments right choose apply here.

Like think police come house arrest forcibly inject you, barred pretty much anything, like working, attending school, etc. smart parents would kids wear masks. stupid parents anti-vax wear masks, children model behaviors. end, whether there's policy masking not, stupid parents ones bear responsibility.  Sorry, typo. so? Employers allowing anyone back office without proof vaccination. everything mitigate traffic accidents driving defensively, buying highly-rated car seats, buying safer cars, on. even put stupid ‚ÄúBaby Board‚Äù sticker mine hopes stop even one person tailgating drive speed limit child car. much ask mask regulations stay place mitigate child‚Äôs risk getting COVID getting vaccinated?   old data. still dont know variants effect children. favor learn think without someone telling think answer is. 100% GQP identify vaccinated. youre focusing way much anti vaxxers, reality there's nothing get change mind. 

&amp;#x200B;

There's sizeable group people getting vaccine bothered yet. type people likely interested getting vaccine guidance clear getting vaccinated mean worry masks social distancing.  Besides, phobia forced me, never asked this, 

I know it‚Äôs easy sit pretend performance I‚Äôm putting on, claiming ignore easily 

To claim it‚Äôs simple take care extremely stupid also completely true

They given methods get vaccinated without issues, wanting entirely new conspiracy? vaccinated shed proteins could infect unvaccinated need wear masks protect Yes Sure, didn‚Äôt many cases apparently  I‚Äôm sure whether feel sorry people laugh them. Live let live suppose. One thing certainly true media done set scare people thinking going turn dust Thanos style walk outside without mask on. media blame here.  won‚Äôt. 
We 8/10 people vaccinated without opening Pandora‚Äôs box. don‚Äôt naive idiot open box. Even Japan countries extreme vaccine hesitancy enough people vaccinated able function normally. 

Every single social political change human history snowball.  Even violent revolutions preceded years escalating violence rhetoric. start taking away peoples rights ‚Äúfor greater good‚Äù don‚Äôt hesitate nearly much again. choice, comes thing like coke, pepsi, know choices 0 consequence anyone one making choice. 
Vaccines, hands, protect also herd immunity protect can‚Äôt vaccinated. scenario taking shot impact others, unlike choosing pepsi. 
I see case forced vaccination. free lot things, freedoms end impact people.  understand always local unlinked cases. easy ring-fence test them.

But one dam broken, gone hell. TIL....jk 


We've year. know now...well...you're probably dumber puppy. Yea definitely fucked getting annual flu shot wearing mask. swear I‚Äôve reading variations headline year now. Japan seasonal allergies flu season. It‚Äôs weird wear one times year. 

For typically wear makeup don‚Äôt time morning don‚Äôt feel it. mask perfect way save time morning.  much misinformation. said another thread every post vaccine efficacy thousand different incorrect explanations means. commonly ‚Äúyou still 5% chance getting covid‚Äù isn‚Äôt correct. swear need like bill nye PSA explaining layman‚Äôs terms Kids also cant consent whether feel safe school public. feels like testers government fucked up. decisions end causing kids life long health problems choice happens bodies. seems unethical lift mask mandates right age group say! Well, one favorite boogeymen whole last year. mom know still online? Damn it. know that. Thanks! thing need understand we're talking 10% unvaccinated ... right less 40% fully vaccinated almost 54% without even single dose. That's \*ALOT\* people many never get vaccinated matter ... there's mandatory verification system (such vaccine passports) there's need get vaccinated.   I‚Äôm married partner shares parenting responsibilities sometimes schedules line require child going store one us. 

Think last time run grocery store last minute item try imagine situation watching 2 year old time. Can‚Äôt leave home curbside pickup isn‚Äôt always instant.   cousin anaphylactic allergies probably able get vaccine end year. really sucks.  4 people standing around lake, 1 person swimming lake, misleading say person choosing swim *most* risk drowning. 

No he's one risk. Good God, about-face people view Coronavirus ridiculous. We‚Äôre near herd immunity, children 12 aren‚Äôt vaccinated large portion population still waiting vaccinated. CDC still gathering data vaccine efficacy relevant data. 

All year sub criticizing anti-maskers anti-vaxxers guise ‚Äúsafety‚Äù vulnerable. Yet, one seems give damn mask change clearly contradictory entire sub‚Äôs beliefs thoughts. Stay classy, Reddit. Australia Thats point... known going another year masks, wouldn‚Äôt gotten vaccinated quickly, would‚Äôve waited. didn‚Äôt. 

I got vaccinated moment told to. shut business months told to. masked told double masked told to. 

Now they‚Äôre saying don‚Äôt mask fully vaccinated status protects others‚Äîthe whole reason it. 

I don‚Äôt feel like tacking extra year it‚Äôs trendy. child asthma? one unlucky percent vaccine work well? wearing mask big inconvenience we're willing risk people's sickness death it? least case rates lower? want able get kids vaccinated Covid, too. know flu dangerous, vaccinate. Covid still dangerous, even it‚Äôs dangerous, want vaccinate. that, can‚Äôt bring kids public places lying anti-vaxers hanging out. live? I'd like move there. Ya people get  bigoted thing say... Yes, sometimes need stop store way home can't always plan ahead curbside. stores offer curbside. mitigate risk people want get back normal ones preventing it. hide kid inside another summer. many developmental milestones outside Covid improtant, specially age. stores around (within 30+ min drive, despite living city) curbside pickup groceries, low cost($2-$5), system purchase charges inflated prices lower selection food what's available store. price week's groceries came around 20% higher shopping store fees. afford it... know single parent low income.

If food related there's free pickup. Come India, people caught covid YOUNG PEOPLE 25 Requiring mask undoubtedly causes people stay home avoid person dining. Lifting restrictions couple weeks ahead big American holiday give hospitality much needed boost. Bars restaurants suffered enough it‚Äôs time let people make decision. going go Fauci said previously? add comment, last spring I‚Äôve lifting running many years. lifting wasn‚Äôt effected much, basically couldn‚Äôt run rest year. getting terrible shin splints almost immediately. finally started taking vitamin months back I‚Äôm easing back running seemed make difference. also covid toes they‚Äôd red purple ran think inflammation area, it‚Äôs also happening anymore. absolutely feel yet. NYT never quite great want believe, past decade degenerated hard geyser mixed clickbait brunch-set liberals + social-engineering ""journalism"" nobody except brunch-set liberals wants read. USA conserns which?

Neither public individual health. U.S. concerned primarily economics. mean specific elected officials concerned health part, organizations called ""government"" focused economics first. Whether get disease virus depends lot viral load start with. Almost everyone's immune system could fight single copy virus, everyone limit changes.

Masks absolutely help stop larger droplets. smaller particles, catch build enough represent threat. That's standing farther away limiting exposure time also help. sure US not, case not, government literally authority something ‚Äúthe greater good‚Äù. country founded individual freedoms destiny aka citizen USA right, responsibility look yourself, governments.

The two arguments ‚Äúthe greater good‚Äù ‚Äúyour personal liberties end starts negatively affect others beyond reasonable level‚Äù subjective ABSOLUTELY lead slippery slope. 

We tried arguments prohibition, didnt work well. Sad someone would favor mandatory vaccination Dude, subreddit COVID-19, everything going lens.

If want make case masks actually dangerous somebody aggregate affects diseases... well going need back actual science. no, comments beginning pandemic everybody fucking everything count.  effectiveness flu vaccines quite low - [roughly years far lower. Even vaccinated kid still moderate risk seasonal flu. disagree. implications others simple. freedom come expense others. Anyone vector.  Indian Variant floating around heard made way US  *Smirk amd mirrors. literally study says this. 100% this. measures whole lot harm good.  misrepresenting case.

The court ruled Colorado nondiscrimination commission good enough job neutral religion must reconsider.

The commission still rule bakery violated law. either lying can't read news. publicly known March 2020 Fosun rights greater China.

Would anyone trust China favor global public health [when consistently block Taiwan World Health would another surge? You‚Äôre ignoring vaccination drive plummeting cases. last surge March / April. won‚Äôt another one, is, don‚Äôt feel bad knowing it‚Äôll affect unvaxxed morons. Sad following science would cause protests.  people would lie vaccinated already wearing masks public anyway.

I suspect quite begrudgingly wear masks don‚Äôt want confrontation. 

I‚Äôm sure depends area country you‚Äôre in, don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve seen one person indoors without mask. floodgates open, they‚Äôll happily claim vaccinated avoid wearing mask. part ""Monday numbers mean anything"" understand? Texas zero COVID deaths straight false, since many places report weekend numbers Monday mask forever crowd calling fully vaxxed folks ""reckless"" &amp; ""heartless"" wanting ditch masks. You‚Äôve done can. 

Relax fun.  problem CDC's timing everyone chance get doses yet, CDC's announcement effectively gives shitheads out. there's verification anything, means people received vaccine want one danger would CDC held bit. Nothing 100% effective; looking 100% effective prevention covid, never leave house never anyone come reason (including food delivery!) 

I stand statement. wear N95 goggles, nothing fear others near you.  office building still remaining closed year end I‚Äôm fine with. Masks still required stores California parent I‚Äôll
Wear mask support child isn‚Äôt Eligible yet.

I haven‚Äôt much sniffle year masking cold flu season esp wildcard next flu season essential reality facts mean anything anymore. narratives. 

After all, reality intersubjective :) Asthma, COPD, seasonal allergies. first time adult life, gone entire year without major respiratory infections. That's masks distancing.

This real eye-opener mine. almost like medical device continues medical benefits even current emergency over. Shocking. It‚Äôs fault it‚Äôs fair healthcare workers patients need ICU care. still quasi-irrational fear vaccine isn‚Äôt effective think still get it. also lot social anxiety, I‚Äôm enjoying buffer pandemic created people  way jerk reason got anything interest say?   Mine either; except took flight early April 2 yo got minor sniffles light fever couple days got back.

Honestly, I'm little worried lack illness. time kids supposed building strong immune systems. Exposure germs pathogens age help build immune system even contract harmless diseases dangerous older (mono, CMV, EBV).

We feed kids plenty allergens veggies healthy foods, hope lack sort sickness come back bite later. thought experiment, think agree theoretically deadly contagious enough disease would make vaccine compulsory. 100x contagious deadly covid instance, extremists would oppose idea. 

So question whether it‚Äôs reasonable compel people take vaccine contagious disease. It‚Äôs question whether covid dangerous enough warrant it.   said parents transportation. can't use curbside pickup without car. also can't use using SNAP. Thank you, actually sounds reasonable. I‚Äôm certainly willing go another month wear masks airplanes medical facilities forever. 

But I‚Äôve getting nervous mask culture might mean everywhere forever it‚Äôs ‚Äúfeeling safe‚Äù trusting vaccine waiting every human jabbed. sake children....

Oh mean care children‚Äôs well being...

Not came opening school, closing playgrounds, implementing insane guidelines camps. now. hey look, NYT ""reporting"" problem helped create üôÑ aren't. Nobody requiring anything want to. goalposts move. person wants wear mask, promise, hurt anything feelings.   need one variant strong transmissibility immunity escape we're potentially back square one. 4 billion people lot opportunity mutation, even entirely self serving perspective idea ignoring incredibly dumb. Maybe west things move closer normal, over. mean current level mask wearing/disinfectant smashed flu infections 2020 there's obviously benefit there.  Well nothing stopping wearing masks Thats version found far :( Countries vaccinate first. given.

When countries donating helping out.

This way going happen. UN need stop wasting time energy fear mongering spend efforts something useful.  one deliberately obtuse claiming something didn‚Äôt say. 

I know might news you, Covid 19 isn‚Äôt disease world. worry much. kids young well, Covid early last month. asymptomatic never felt effects, found mother sick got tested well. 

Kids resliant hell. Making community goal encouragement, extremely easy access, incentives ‚Äî campaign ‚Äî promise lifting mask mandates upon reaching goal would help lot. works state government takes seriously cares health people. Time look job respects employees! Kids 2 often can't wear mask even reliant everyone else wearing mask. We're desperately trying mask train 16 month old leave house again.   Pressing X.  obviously believe variants situation coming countries. still average 30k new infections day 600 people still dying it?? metric virus exactly? anti-mask propaganda psychotic literally antithesis working for.... Dumbest thing Redfield ever said (and saying something), Osterholm aghast comment. Yep. Individual responsibility individual risks. Collective responsibility collective risks. We've immersed latter long time now, vaccination we're moving broadly towards former. Keep digging Watson company makes ativan fucking thriving.   live, gov MADE wear mask repercussion law? Crazy people sub calling others like science deniers think soon get rid masks  1 200 children died last year died covid. Thats cited.. evidence *not* dangerous kids? I‚Äôm sitting there, barbecue sauce titties. Fascinating. tell long-term side effects COVID vaccination anyone then. they? I'll wait, can't answer question, response complete bullshit. time adjust back

Welcome interovert family. stay long still mostly dislike socializing.  work forces back 30% office vaccinated I'm immunocompromised, that's me? Wtf? Children immunocompromised quickly becoming second class citizens country disturbing amount people seem okay that.  That‚Äôs even handed assessment that‚Äôs probably far form truth. Thanks last bit though. someone wear mask around immunocompromised friends, crowded indoor concerts, crowded environments don‚Äôt trust others, otherwise maskless, it‚Äôs tough reading comments calling doomer liking pandemic... point everyone chance vaccinated free. what‚Äôs masks? People choosing vaccinate choosing risk able free country. fully vaccinated don‚Äôt want wear mask people want roll dice. someone risk obviously need take precautions, us done everything right allowed mask mask point. only* risk thought determined ventilators best solution? trying sarcastic, we?  Tell kids died. 
Also least affected least likely die long term kids alot bad effects may never go away. Kids safe. Id never even heard chalazion this. 

Chalazion: slow-growing, inflammatory lump oil gland eyelid.

Hasn't happened me, anyone else?  mean, really leaping assume worst there. point advocate harassing people choose continue wearing masks crowded places sick. 

I simply pointing guy vaccinated chooses continue wearing two masks goggles supermarket visit least 5 years going appear paranoid eccentric time. Honestly, ever guidance two masks goggles good idea? think likely would considered someone bit eccentric even worst winter wave. Day two post Pfizer second-dose. symptom headache that's gone now. Knee back joints little sore yesterday, too, barely noticeable. mom also symptoms. Step dad chills yesterday that's it. could concerned fact children still unvaccinated.  Remember one public health official (Redfield think?) said masking far important superior vaccines? 

LMAO, messaging pandemic absurd complete systemic failure. Maybe something try United States? people thread described reasons currently able get vaccine shot. shit I'm vaccinated really mind masks. kind like see people's stupid faces. cdc saying vaccinated unmasked yet going free all. point CDC addressing reasonable people, you.   BIG duh  Sure, that‚Äôs feel guess you‚Äôre right. don‚Äôt personally think gamble proved make little difference stopping virus, forced people stop partaking healthy activities outside worth it. really wants protect need get N95 mask, double masking wont shit body else wears mask. fair, boat. Except moronic behavior annoys people ignoring safety others especially kids able get vaccine yet morons. mechanism determines whether get lifetime immunity? think it‚Äôs Warby Parker commercial  protect you. Good. let go waste, give people want instead since filth country refusing it. many pediatric flu deaths 2019? We're talking usual here. randomly bring planes? Why's matter circulate air? fully vaccinated matter circulated indoor location cause can't get sick gonna small viral load matter... I've basically stopped wearing mask unless store wants cause can't get sick I'm living fear virus can't hurt me.  PA dropped mask mandate fully vaxxed people, every municipality has. allergies! First time years didn‚Äôt cough 2-3 months. 

So yeah, I‚Äôll wear mask certain circumstances, necessarily religiously, it‚Äôs normal countries I‚Äôd rather miserable.  Several countries completely eradicate borders aggressively locking down. places like US everything could make sure never goes away.   worries, American, Germany. Don‚Äôt envious. Aside developing Biontech vaccine, rollout disastrously slow. family US vaccinated whereas we‚Äôre expecting vaccinated least another 2 months history? went around changed minds jabbed arms, waited dozen weeks jabbed again? Nobody yet. Online shopping Ego Unless directly spitting someone‚Äôs mouth kissing outside chances swallowing someone else‚Äôs droplet extremely small even close contact outdoors. potentially kids 12, although parents typically big say much exposure kids get. plan. vaccine? jobs government. medical license. flying country. 

Like give nurses/Drs/medical receptionists/fucking hospital janitors/ etc 6 weeks get vaccinated fire anyone complying.

I'm sick stupidity. think masks remain permanently?

Did seriously think going ""gotchya""? Phone scammers changing jobs speak I'm probably going get hit votes saying think cases continue decline foreseeable future. theory people took covid seriously generally masked, social distanced possible, got vaccinated soon could. think large portion things actually got covid. think probably much widespread currently know highest rates amongst take seriously. 

Someone reddit called theory ""Turd Immunity"" posted everyone trying understand cases dropping quickly despite early slow roll vaccine. think thing may cause another major near term surge variant breaking vaccines infecting people sick previously older variant. 

Long term though? really depends long lasting immunity vaccine getting infected. Good. partners already contracts. companies asking patents willing produce free people working free? can't get sympathy trying make money work others.

the correct way could also submit profit availability governments countries. assuming actually produce vaccines themselves. then... make sense guess what? don‚Äôt care. I‚Äôm vaccinated doesn‚Äôt matter seems like lot people believe masks prevent getting sick primary function using mask prevent infecting others sick aware it. hospital chain? like chain Burger Kings? article reads fear mongering believe written influence US. 

As international news, less fear mongering warning/prediction. 

US nearly done though  Guidance Changed NYT Still Writing Articles Shame People, Maybe Forever ""I consider people like look like loonies""
""No pressure, take mask ‚Ä¶"" place hope people may actually honest work, also know many people company (40k ish employees across whole company) bunch assholes act like vaccinated.

Our guidelines office re-open soon, vaccinated mask/distance free, unvaxxed means masks distance office. Lowest number deaths yesterday since March 23rd 2020, beginning pandemic US. Also, first day US's cases teens forever! taken time look back see last time happened. Same, imagine likely either old (with already weakened immune system) type immunocompromised state vaccine produced immune response. Yeah, none places open kitchen. Well weird-ass situation right now.

The CDC essentially seen making policy right now, weird. would make lot sense health agencies like CDC inform governments, either nationwide state level, governments , governments make policy. right weird pandemic era agencies like CDC seen policy makers think ever original intention. Wait till find people without masks might vaccinated either. statement says, initial efficacy calculated people symptoms symptoms. 
The next news referring to, regarding symptomatic infections only. mean can't work away home? day care, child parents work? mask mandate never applied people's homes. would moving ""we interpret science"" ""we make policy"". State/Federal governments make policies, CDC. think proves masks work? envy live. It‚Äôs rare see people wearing type masks anymore. moved Florida Washington DC. conservative state pretty liberal place. difference type masks, everyone wears cloth, paper masks, doesn‚Äôt wear one all. guess assumed comment replied American. Sorry that. Ima vaccinated don‚Äôt wearing mask. want breath fresh air. want smile people. 

If want wear one that‚Äôs cool. I‚Äôm going unless business work says want realize airplanes recirculate air right?

That categorically untrue lmao. Stop spreading misinformation. would've funny like 50%! Oooo sorry typo 60%! Woops fired guy posted that. 70%. Uhoh new data suggests 80%. 80%!üòÇ I'm making sure grape juice fully mixed also breath aerosols stop spitting larger droplets people talking. Sure, also have:

1) labor shortage issue retail employers want try keep employees. Telling worker waiting expected mask mandate around little longer, may find worker choosing come work fully vaxxed.

2) Many employees even 2 weeks past 2nd dose yet got vaxxed April 6/13 Moderna/Pfizer (gen pop vaccinations even start April 19th many places). caveat weekend reporting, good sign anyway. cannot get vaccine? stay masked keep safe. Vaccination higher-risk masking.

Is it? mean - fully combined risk getting covid (not wearing mask) worse risks getting vaccine? Comparing vaccine wearing mask correct masks effective vaccine. We‚Äôve protecting wearing masks could care less, yeah don‚Äôt care anymore. I‚Äôm tired caring assholes glad let die. I‚Äôve done fkn year; I‚Äôm done. need keep fear alive, otherwise it‚Äôs longer historic story wait hurricane political sex scandal get clicks. COVID severity depends viral load. knew wearing mask doesn‚Äôt help prevent much reduce risk affecting others. wearing mask reduce incoming viral load thus end less sick Yeah, that's thing me. point, ton people vaccinated anyone wants vaccine get vaccine. care random guy lies getting vaccinated wear mask? got vaccinated, friends got vaccinated family got vaccinated. person guy hurting wearing mask anti-vax people. Well, deserved death. since Rona get them, def make hard live. So? They've saying whole pandemic worn masks whole pandemic... stop life them? I'm fully vaccinated barely get sick even gonna asymptomatic... care? can't spread virus either small amount it'll spread asymptomatically... cares? everyone scared? politically driven articles, meant encourage vaccination fear. Personally approve Vaccine availability varied tremendously depending live. I'm glad easier area mine. 

The point trying make fair assume everyone could easily get first shot week eligibility opened up. There's excuse first shot now, mid-May, first half April, barriers ""their lack trying."" 

BTW, kudos boss helpful supportive! thought little crazy saying might wear mine grocery end year.


Of course depends things play out. hope numbers drop feel comfortable dropping mask time summer, I'm expecting surge next weeks anti-vaxxers stopped wearing masks well. that‚Äôs true it‚Äôs odd essentially announced nation-wide policy literally every location allowed regardless local mandates. guess governments trying pick battles maybe? post removed cannot verify reliable source. Twitter sources may reliable. possible, please re-submit link reliable source (i.e. news article).

Thank helping us keep information /r/Coronavirus reliable!


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* feel bad immune compromised we're basically telling need stay quarantined indefinitely rest us go party.

I dont feel bad anti masker science denier dies COVID dozens chances right thing, fair assholes preventing us getting herd immunity protecting people can't get vaccinated even though want 1) sick vacations 2) sick year. Masking plane rides actually sounds like good move. risk getting sick plane wasting precious vacation time money? That‚Äôs‚Ä¶ we‚Äôre doing. forget whole thread about? Well think Jim Bob feel like it. Yeah virtually flu season might good idea mask crowded situations like that, especially winter Literally everyone around half sub basically saying see can't trust them! dropping mask thing quickly giving people enough time fully vaccinated(they give adults 6 weeks able get vaccine opened everyone, like literally can't trust CDC...).  doubts require proof. hope logistics actually another animal. Especially since fakes exist. 77,000,000 doses distributed administered right now. soon, mutated version bypasses vaccines pop don‚Äôt surprised. kids (by choice, I'm old...) I'd like understand kid can't wear N95?  issue face small seal properly? children tolerate mask well? fucking don't. blind?! Sort DEATHS per million. can't look total deaths without considering population differences. people get this? evidence coronavirus could transmitted asymptomatic people might aware infectiousness ‚Äì group estimated account 50% transmissions. agency said masks intended block virus-laden particles might emitted infected report updated Tuesday, CDC says still primary intention wearing masks

So main reason still bcs give fuck ppl though? seriously doubt restaurants going requiring it. exe-wife nurse hospital even required get it. gotten plan :(  probably depends parents, absolutely would that. It‚Äôs bit harder convincingly 4 month old :) Maybe name killing word. UK vaccines too. don‚Äôt enough trust them. happened spanisg flu lol feel like good things China always wrong reasons though. clear politics involved every bit aid China sends out. EU example gives lot foreign aid China, without politicising it. Highlands Ranch checking in.....I store days, people following rules pretty well (1-3 maskholes avg) stores whole time. 

My kids shop Castle Rock back nice teenage girl told daughter 'you need wear mask here'. kept on, saying wanted safe. said 'I got fucking Covid asshole like school constantly ditched mask class'. 

But, know, die, count. ""And means pandemic drags twice long would enforced mask mandate bit longer, it!""  without us knowing new variants resist vaccines

We've yet find variant escapes vaccines. we're going stop new variants. setting unachievable target one around long enough us determine vaccines work it, point next one say know vaccines work it. smart move California. Pairing reopening date lifting mask mandate gives everyone one clean date view reopening end mandate.

In articles decision (I believe LA Times mentioned it), mention one main reasons chose approach give businesses time prepare adjust moving forward. Lifting mandate randomly would cause huge amounts confusion. can't even begin imagine shit show local Ralphs dropped mandate today randomly. way Ralphs, employees, surrounding community know expect come June 15. California recently announced adopting CDC guidelines June 15th. Kids pretty resilient. would guess young kids almost trauma it, older kids probably around much adults. numbers still alarmingly high daily basis call mask requirement, IMHO. think got numbed back winter tallying 300,000 cases day, 35,000 looks like chump change. not. That's number cases looking time last year.

To clear, I'm one people ever wore mask outside. I've cautious, fanatical.

Aside that, I'm professor college south, vaccination rate still pitiful. daughter 2 years old rare disease. high mortality rate 3 years old. Respiratory failure one top causes death. wish could keep indoor mask mandates vaccine young kids later year. true. reason mandate mask wearing largely vaccinated population exhibiting minimal viral spread, context overall risk public health mitigated. still non-zero risk catching COVID, even risk death essentially zero respond vaccine.

It perfectly rational choose reduce risk wearing mask, especially interact vulnerable individuals cannot vaccinated unlikely benefited vaccine. Makes sense I'm sure know mean...  2 Corbin talk variants see would.

Here‚Äôs hopeful data. plots show Israel case (blue) death counts (black). started vaccinating people Pfizer late December. mid January, 1 5 Israelis first shot. see case counts dropped dramatically reached all-time peak January. shows vaccine able bring case rates significantly. every study far shows Pfizer holding variants. Moderna pretty similar would likely results.

They went 8k new cases day 100. Vaccinating people gun point? Sources?? Good neighbors don‚Äôt make stuff Congrats! I'm looking forward hitting 2 week mark. wife covid pretty bad late November January. kids also (very mild cases), tested negative early on, I'm assuming test... room wife 20 hours per day. doctor told perfectly safe, they're stuck bubble misinformation got 20 bucks says get vaccinated grow strain covid wild harmful vaccinated. Believe me, I'm tempted! took 13 yr old mass vax place asked directly several times birthday old is. would upto daughter make birthday stick it. I'm sure comfortable that. morally tough spot parent tell kid lie. I'm still thinking though, cooped year! wonder parents kids close 12? thanks awards guys, dont think I've ever gotten one Costco seems requiring seems people cool thinking others. get CDCs thinking now? wait June July lift mask mandates everyone vaccinated. think would‚Äôve made things simpler everyone levels risk situations. completely safe.

Public transportation general much crowded enclosed space people potentially spend hours time together.

It‚Äôs surprise separate guidance situation think know that. North Dakotan here. see person without mask every time go gas station there‚Äôs never 10 people there. is, best, calculated risk. Yes, risk lowering day, seems insanely silly paused lives year, rush weeks early. Patience clearly strong quality American people (as whole).

I'd waited *least* majority citizens vaccinated. We're talking masks here... nothing more. obnoxious people even complaining - rest us strapping ignoring go normal tasks. almost always case, Karens loudest, people charge tend think voice people. don‚Äôt understand. People need fresh air building‚Äôs boiler systems specifically designed able keep building temperatures reasonable middle winter windows open. number throwing best guess real world backing thresholds much lower diseases

Yes 70-80% numbers best guess epidemiologist worldwide given, can't assume we've reached herd immunity relax requirements. proof thresholds much lower diseases? proof data backing claims, neither prove applies Covid-19, caused global pandemic. hedge fund make risky bets, people's lives stake.  Million adults fully vaxed NJ, really think adding little going huge impact? 
  figuring % folks natural immunity catching it. include them, likely easily 70% mark, include vaccinated folks even though done. 


Do think so? know, you? facts increase margins vaccinated huge impact? solid data confirm hit 70% mark? claims data driven. wrong, people's lives get lost, held accountable random claims, gov't be. nothing wrong easing it.  data driven there, case numbers plummeted likely near floor

Nope anywhere close Israel UK are. Also, know cases rise here? half country unvaccinated. guarantee this? proof data guarantee happen. talk way cause skin game. Almost 600,000 Americans dead, empathy.  


None arguments backed data, random claims like pandemic deniers here. backing assumptions, want gov't put citizens' lives line. That's data driven, that's cognitive bias. Well, could little bit squashed ""the weekly new infection rate year ago."" Like, get rates decline, they're yet. policy designed appeal people somehow feel like life ruined wait another month walk packed Target unmasked. CDC pandering lowest common denominator, would course advocate wearing masks we're seeing rare, limited outbreaks. mask outdoors, always carry it. indoor business wants wear it, will.

(Fully vaccinated)

Pathetic anti Newsom animals circling, accusing throwing away 'science'. CDC's job make rules. support Newsom wanting keep us masked another month. Get many people vaccinated possible lifting mandate.

You whiners going suck another month, though doubt will. think underestimating vaccinated people natural immunity lead exponential declines cases. might herd immunity levels spread dies slowed substantially. see post claim get people vaccinated. eventually herd immunity would achieved. believe part it. However, guarantee CDC modeled different scenarios take account unvaccinated people going maskless. 

Also, mention vaccinated people able catch Covid... true. However, viral load? effectively spread others?

Your comments less science CDC risk adverse risk profile. Another thing consider: cases dropped precipitously since introduction vaccines. precipitously figure we‚Äôve VASTLY underestimated many unreported cases COVID been. numbers don‚Äôt really add otherwise. 

This would mean many many people low no-symptom cases didn‚Äôt know it. people effectively immune ever since it, putting us much closer threshold herd immunity previously thought. first people line vaccinate likely done best social distancing (and therefore likely avoided ever catching it). you‚Äôve got people never (who given shot), people (which higher number previously thought based reported cases). Add together it‚Äôs pretty promising picture. 

***EVERYONE STILL GO GET VACCINATED. COVID (OR SUSPECTED IT) REASON RISK UNDER-PROTECTED***  employee stationed front door would stop anyone without mask wearing mask improperly. CDC link provided. levels assume recommended prevention measures followed, individual venue (if applicable).
CDC cannot provide specific risk level every activity every community. important consider personal situation risk you, family, community venturing out.

The CDC guidelines safety levels based assumption individuals venues enforce mask wearing non-vaccinated.
So safety level venue following prevention measures?
It also advises people consider situation, one say anyone still wearing mask following CDC. shit! People would lose minds mandate continued. voted 2018 signed recall petition much disagree he's handled pandemic outside first months. 

Specifically, ever changing tier system hidden data, arbitrary selection business closures, reinstituting outdoor dining ban. really pushed sign winter curfew view unequivocally infringing freedom.  doesn‚Äôt work husband travels M-F. Oooohh... I'm shaking boots!! mean, general someone says outside going mean packed outdoor concert mass protests, events want wear masks. Meijer announced requiring masks frustrated?

Vaccinated people risk, putting others risk.

Unvaccinated, unmasked people risk matter what.

Keep kid masking social distancing later year vaccinations become available them. masks help might hurt
 
Can link something cites actually saying this? recall CDC ever saying this. Yeah CDC great job 600k people dead. dont even know thats right, might closer 1 million. would mean 1/300 people kicked bucket within year. Awesome job 10/10  Fosun produce vaccines. reached deal BionTech Pfizer. reached similar deal BionTech Pfizer early 2020, limited China, Taiwan, Hong Kong Macau (BionTech supply tech, Fosun like Pfizer conduct clinical trial production) Ah yes, constantly wearing masks worse standard procedures. Really sells use masks.  Meijer dropped requirement.. limits that. IE, regards pandemics. Man, nickle every completely context ""impending doom"" comment subreddit, I'd wealthy man. Here‚Äôs thing. person make risk assessment. tend default recommended CDC. don‚Äôt data specialized knowledge. data show risk kids worse flu plenty things risky kids day day basis; driving one. 

The recommendation that‚Äôs given vaccinated people don‚Äôt need wear masks bunch situations. Kids aren‚Äôt vaccinated continue wear masks. 

Some folks argue letting vaccinated people unmask risky anti-mask anti-vaccine people lie. that‚Äôs probably true believe CDC endless meetings discussed accounted recommendation. Basically x%of population unmasked unvaccinated. Knowing probably thought still made recommendation cdc Fauci particular conservative liberal recommendations give sense ease recommendation isn‚Äôt given lightly. North America. That‚Äôs interesting way try paint person corner kill legit reply. 

Can converse without childish tricks like that? Maybe get family doctor explain works ease fears little. description sounds like afraid ""new technology"" rather conspiracy nuts, might help understood it. Understandable, thank you. guess holding weird anxieties stemmed last year. tough return without knowing absolute certain boxes checked. forget ask doctor band aid show. Sort ‚Äúnew deaths,‚Äù champ.

Florida holds #1 spot.

While everyone else got clobbered early took preventive measures slowly get control mess, Florida fucking around still finding out. Dumb-dumbs Ya I‚Äôm fully vaccinated still wear mask stores want toddler wear one. seems CDCs thinking, jumped chance offer carrot instead stick. Meanwhile everyone rightfully wary. Unvaccinated adults, kids, vaccinated people immunocompromised know protected are. read recommendations implied masks preventive measures horribly burdensome causing harm (the old mental health concern dragged lot lately).   Given neither child flu year, get sick pretty bad winter, probably will. 

I mean Lord forbid wear piece cloth people countries already commonly wear prevent illnesses. child persistent cough month willing pay price avoid sleepless nights again.

What's old adage? ounce preventative worth pound cure. know Austin Tx reporting data weekends anymore. sure anywhere else according World Meters, counties report cases deaths weekend Texas. said does? one saying unvaccinated people longer need wear masks. said, choose vaccinate wear masks, one obligation save consequences behavior.

I'm confused exactly saying here. unvaccinated people supposed still wearing masks not? are, saying one obligated enforce laws? I'm sorry I'm honestly confused trying say here. Well, guess I'm gonna loony wanting get sick, then. Whenever catch cold, always get (seemingly) worst family lasting effects (cough, phlegmy nose lungs) like month afterwards.

Once we're past pandemic, masks required anymore, no, already see people judged for, free will, taking bit precaution get sick. actually feel even worse people wear masks go live (if they're immunocompromised way, example) who, judging I've seen people say online, brushed crazy possibly harassed anti-mask crowd. I'm bioinformatics scientist 
 
See easy type that? Immunity switch. simply probability. one COVID antibodies immune COVID, have, individual level, decent chance contracting COVID. vaccines already took small hit UK variant, partially reduced efficacy, could take hit Indian variant, we'll see.

Your trying simplify something complex using chain metaphor. question breaking links chain, increasing probability links breaking. current vaccines strong enough give us enough consistent probability breaking chain transmission. That's virus us foreseeable future, mutates favourable way, vaccines/general immunity improves.  Okay thank Newsom's *job* make decision, CDC's. point either force vaccination let people take chances. I'd certainly lean towards forced vaccination route that's going happen. spoken lot people get vaccine? They're living fucking fantasy world completely detached reality. I'm waiting fuckers get together return normal life. 

I feel people conditions make getting vaccinated difficult impossible, that's extremely rare phenomenon new mRNA vaccines. slowly getting back life. It‚Äôs almost surreal pandemic first hit.  Thanks. I‚Äôm guided fear. fact, started wearing mask planes years ago catching vicious cold flight Bangkok. killed chance learn scuba diving.  IMHO kids huge silent vector disease. know anecdotal almost everyone know kids gotten virus. Everyone know without kids took seriously gotten Covid. *except profits you‚Äôre vaccinated, extremely unlikely get bad enough case get long term effects. Furthermore, cases plummeting across country, cannot get infected come across infected person. you‚Äôre still worried, avoid high-risk environments like clubs sports events, really don‚Äôt worry going store unmasked. Bringing flu valid point, *because flu much deadly kids COVID-19*. Michigan, example, 2020, sero COVID-19 deaths among children aged 0-14, five flu deaths among age group.

By logic, shouldn‚Äôt adults permanently mask (or, least flu season), order protect children dying flu? makes sense masking protect COVID-19. Right. absolutely believe masks *help.* whether people pass grocery masked never major factor course epidemic. Yes, thought would half. amazing many people vociferously opposed wearing piece cloth indoors around unvaccinated people little bit longer. bars adults, outdoors, work, going grocery store place kids might present *too much*. messing something? entire point flu isn‚Äôt dangerous. relative amount deaths flu versus child population really really small. I‚Äôm accusing anything lol. Victim mentality strong. I‚Äôm suggesting take drugs calm first. complex vaccination becomes provider hesitant they‚Äôll be. give laundry list say ‚Äúthis way I‚Äôll get vaxxed‚Äù they‚Äôll tell pound sand. Handle side things, allow professionals bridge gap.  harm go Fauci, they‚Äôve idolized point seems infallible. help allergies public walking vector disease. I'll keeping mask long possible, forever possible. Yes kid already safe COVID driving.

A good example would asking parents stop driving order reduce chance kids accident even more. extreme drop influenza cases also huge motivator. I've gotten flu before, really enjoy it, personally.  could end influenza. know how. 

""A year full social distancing, mask wearing, hand washing staying home prevent coronavirus spread rendered 2020-2021 influenza season practically nonexistent."" weird people don‚Äôt realize literally catching ‚Äújournalists‚Äù video tape saying fear/COVID headlines huge business overly pushed daily. county supposed lifted mask mandates yesterday wonder individual target town require masks still. unclear Walmart yesterday hadn‚Äôt taken sign yet everyone wearing mask felt like still even though really didn‚Äôt want  know it‚Äôs several haven‚Äôt reported Sundays while, I‚Äôm assuming it‚Äôs ones. time extras don‚Äôt report typically there‚Äôs holiday attached Monday. People failing grasp idea science literally ever changing goalpost never truly stops say ‚Äútrust science‚Äù. long new data continues roll in, findings procedures change. It‚Äôs literally scientific method works (make hypothesis, experiment test it, collect data, make conclusion, revise findings, repeat). Yeah that's main issue - anti vaxxers. reasonable expectation almost one would ever lie something like besides idiots sure cares.

But LOTS people lie vaccinated. puts immunocompromised people risk well even kids. Also since vaccines 100% effective, odds two vaccinated people making sick low worth worrying about, antivaxxer multiplies risk.

Overall I'm 100% okay vaccinated people masks. However trust people honest vaccination status. parents need relax. Safetyism real problem. fuck downvoted lol.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* already know approximate number symptomatic breakthrough cases risk-matched pairs 3-7% would otherwise (for mRNA vaccines; breakthrough cases JnJ higher). fewer younger, healthy people elderly people people otherwise weakened immune systems. 

The .X% whatever statistic gets thrown around way communicate timebound risk ever changing variables. Without comparison point, useless. likelihood getting *recorded* case COVID month March American .5%. Given that, breakthrough case risk ""effectively"" around .03-.05% (90-95% reduction) fully vaccinated mRNA vaccine entering March. ""real"" risk infection probably like 2% unvaccinated / .1-.2% vaccinated accounting underreporting cases. rare rare statistically irrelevant.  Second hand smoke much easier avoid, fair comparison IMO. walk away someone smoking go non-smoking area, don‚Äôt always know guy next corona virus. Plenty people transmit corona virus despite symptoms themselves, causing spread unknowingly.  Isn‚Äôt good sub since Texans haven‚Äôt following sub‚Äôs advice along? Downvoting means I'm asshole? Sorry oppressing inhibiting free speech lol stupid take. plenty things know would improve public health legally mandate. Vaccines save lives. fact. Eating balanced, limited calorie diet also saves lives. Mandating either things question denying supporting science, rather question balancing public health individual liberty.  lie vaccinated people tell safe? think comparing people work facility heavily filtered air standard office buildings fair. excited, remembered Abbott lies constantly.  hospitals nursing homes Japan require visitors wear mask flu season. Wish would catch countries too. Probably saves lives.  Even Fauci said believes CDCs decision backed science. matter national security? Either almost everyone board work. What's next? Asking freedom educating children sending school teach history?

On side would ok force people want vaccinated system? don‚Äôt consume vaccines. Besides, there‚Äôs many things individuals don‚Äôt choice on. isn‚Äôt circumcision illegal? talking family. situation could see wearing mask again. Definitely always hand sanitizer nearby least. Getting sick going (or coming home from) vacation sucks.  sure voted. I've seen lot people wearing KN95s improperly adjusted nosebands and/or facial hair. filter works force air go via good seal. need repeat myself? vaccine 95% effective. There's already hundreds people county contracted covid fully vaccinated.  think might it'll affect groups unvaccinated.  Nah I'm pretty well versed. Still stand said. fact get buffoonery.  government literally authority something ‚Äúthe greater good‚Äù

Oh give break, that‚Äôs true *fuck* world‚Äôs largest army gallivanting around world whatever hell want? forced pay that?

I American, think big reason country started fall behind rest modern world precisely can‚Äôt grow 300 year old mindset. It‚Äôs impossible sort nuanced discussion personal sacrifice build country people freedom, also help, protect, provide people needed.

Other countries able it, it‚Äôs shame can‚Äôt, really. Hate break Hispanic black communities ones concern statement targets. kind funny many people touting science CDC mask mandates happened screaming CDC full crap. Yes article mentions flare-up two places reports cases outside mention.

Kind of. pretty much stagnated 40 50 last month according trying accurate pedantic, whatever. heart attack chance way dangerous Covid ever individual person

Don't delude yourself. right! Let's go back measles pox again! /s even match isn‚Äôt great, vaccinated get flu help avoid severe case. Way pat back something nearly hand in...how many lives politicians like cost us? Horrid humans. masks good crushed together. plenty healthcare workers direct contact COVID patients 12 hours day weeks/months end become infected wearing N95s. fact point study indicating workers likely contract COVID via unmasked social interactions outside work, I'm trouble tracking down.  I‚Äôm sorry hear PID, don‚Äôt mind asking what‚Äôs reasonable solution opinion? believe population keep wearing mask indefinitely well? I‚Äôm genuinely asking btw I‚Äôm trying dick.  I'm two weeks second vaccination I'm absolutely wearing mask anymore unless to. said, flu season, especially airplane, I'm planning wearing one. point getting sick I‚Äôm vaccinated, care shoppers aren‚Äôt? You‚Äôre behaving like anti-vaxxed, know.  reminding daily. hope people legitimate (and completely understandable) anxiety going back normal lives don‚Äôt get harassed picked choices. Everyone timeline, trauma Covid going takes years recovery many. that‚Äôs ok. kids get Flu vaccine yearly, thus contributing lower health risks. Unfortunately cannot get vaccinated COVID yet. OCD germaphobe here. I'm fucking miserable. Here's comment made literally yesterday: 

[Proudly fully vaccinated here. I'm also OCD germaphobe. realized much spit other's faces talk other, kind grossed out. know need break habit feed OCD, right now, feel like want wear masks public forever, regardless say ""have vaccinate""? forced no, one get vaccinated. everything make driving child safe possible mitigate risk. bought safe car, great car seat, never drive speed limit, avoid dangerous roads. much ask keep mask requirement vaccinate child she‚Äôs safe possible COVID mitigate risk it? illegal. private company, enforce choose not. Shopping Target constitutional right. see entirely subjective? Also, ever looked mortality rates covid? say everyone get vaccine ‚ÄúSAVE LIFE‚Äù ridiculous statement first place Facts opinions   don‚Äôt trust team. Lucky you. virus still squashed? Unvaccinated people going walk around without masks, spreading infection. people virus jumps between, chances mutations, chances mutation requires whole new vaccine.

Not mention, vaccine covered fine, kids can't vaccinated yet. take now? places safely take rapidly dwindling. Certainly, wear masks everywhere go, far effective everyone else still wearing masks. 40 years, still know anybody died flu.

You keep you.  doesn‚Äôt protect customers. ....no. covid death sentence, still avoid getting lucky anti-mask moron Homeschool legal Italy.

If think fantasy, realize done past already human beings changed. one sacred duties befriend, educate, live fellowship around time resisting slight overreach entity holds absolute monopoly violence corruption, aka government. county. Anyone without mask immediately kicked stores.  last breath going intubated groan ""did team?"" Yeah, apparently adopted us-like strategy limiting exports. They're month late deliveries Brazil, vaccination campaign relies raw materials. Good them, bad us. say cigarettes 

Yeah, kill people smoker

Ever heard second hand smoke?  got vaccine world rainbows now. guess fuck kids immunocompromised.

 mom made decision take medicine needs would hurt immunity this.  I'm worried him. post 50 things day. Can't good mental health 95%+ efficacy covid-19 current method administering, uhh yeah hell I? I'm dumb.

As stands, simple shot arm wearing piece cloth face hours public, people *still* it. news , C.D.C Director confirms water wet People wearing seatbelts risk driving car. used fly long haul frequently work I'd kind expect cold trip, swear happened often not. Never anything serious course, dude two seats back coughing whole flight common. guy hocking phlegm jar sat behind us. hope become unthinkably faux pas now. know viral partials travel void right? travel attached water droplets breath don‚Äôt fooled statistics ever guides policy. case wouldn‚Äôt incredibly shitty policies around prisons, healthcare labor. Weapons alcohol would banned. thing guides policy money. Yep, sub full people entire last year suddenly they're trusting CDC, ya know. Wait, saying sky blue? Italy could certainly win, believe death rate nigh equal Brazil. harm kids wearing masks social development likely outweighs benefits

Are kidding idiocy?

Oh, absolute FACT vaccines 100%. makers flat state that. Seems like fragile deal piece cloth face without throwing temper tantrum. pathetic. says that? Get yourself. People choice get vaccine not. It‚Äôs free widely accessible. choose get vaccine accepting risk mother law died stroke brain stem Wednesday. gotten second dose week watching in-laws come woodwork screech vaccine killed infuriating. Sure, that, TOTALLY wants taking blood pressure medicine. I'm unaware data showing vaccines worn require booster. link any? Old news, variant US since least Mid April. People Conveniently making articles CDC posted updates. I'm bit confused comment, elaborate bit? over-joyed CDC's guidance regarding masking vaccinated people. rest country wants drag feet (either vaxxing/masking continuing mask vaxxing) let it.

don't force play along delusions. everything right 14 months never got covid, double vaxxed want live life Lots. know multiple people got trip Florida, got tested returning home. didn‚Äôt like that. 

Stupidity mismanagement made way. 

Other countries comparable US seemed okay, cause actually listened science rejected political feelings towards needed done. Fuck idiot. Way live reality. somewhat older data, subsequent followup group showed 54% immunosuppressed transplant patients mounted response second dose. said, response lower average person ability fend virus unknown, T/B cell responses still analyzed. Length transplant Moderna vaccine correlated positive antibody response (Moderna 60% effectiveness generating response, Pfizer 48%). could waited kids eligible vaccine months allowing people breath kids without masks. already established wearing masks protect others. Kids wearing mask isn‚Äôt going protect themselves. It‚Äôs grossly premature. I've considered people refuse wear masks peak infection rates vaccination look like loonies. consider people like look like loonies going forwards. course, want look unhinged that's prerogative, guess. People LOVE control everyone else doing. personality trait some. think focusing vaccines preventing covid wrong angle, unless you‚Äôre looking burden healthcare. Obviously burden important look at, maybe important aspect this, people don‚Äôt care look it. 

The focus getting people vaccinated *now know vaccines prevent spreading*. 

I think lot people decided they‚Äôre worried getting covid, vaccinated not. We‚Äôre talking enough vaccines prevent spread. 

I‚Äôve fully vaccinated weeks. main benefit able see people again, elderly people example. vaccination status affect worried myself. 

So authorities really need step messaging game spread. People understand friends neighbors different levels worried catching themselves. Saying vaccines reduce spread help worried people feel better encourage non-worried people get vaccinated *knowing still want relationships worried people*. way forward.  particularly care I'm exposed 50+ people's germs. That's vaccine for. entire point vaccinated return normal. That's normal thing me. actually important take account, people age gonna get still hoops jump even vaccinated. 

I used hooking example something naturally follows party. Furthermore, need able meet people, covid made difficult. Oh impression Indian variant gonna worsen things point we‚Äôd back step 1. infiltration variant UK despite 70% people first dose, already talking reversing lockdown. Good didn‚Äôt.  may try sway thinking time time still mutual respect other. adults all. people comfortable getting vaccine. I'd suggest looking around areas, argue antidotes everything around still really dead, people going back normal, sure, restaurants nowhere near old capacities. news, carrots edible. Trump-supporters are/were ‚Äúmaskholes‚Äù. 

My parents supported former President wished taken pandemic seriously wearing masks everywhere. Also hated fact kept disputing election. supported policies though, especially immigration. people mentally ill. least people crazy things hurt anyone, vs. anti-vaxxers anti-maskers hurting people indirectly result actions.

everyone needs see therapist odds always favor, 99.98%. link studies articles read that?

And looking like vaccination going likely require yearly booster shots I've read, combat new variants waning efficacy year vaccination. dont seem know sure case, many studies indicated likely.

Now efficacy matters get vaccine every year (or maybe less year since efficacy much lower), live city lot medical malpractice poor healthcare, would likely drive large city better known good healthcare. would feel comfortable getting vaccine 3 half hours drive (one way). average person might seem bad, immunocompromised, factor dangers maskless restroom facilities various difficulty presents get back. also worth pointing likely much better methods combat covid (via antibody believe) works. Might better me, depending efficacy, hold mRNA vaccine see promise methods show. What's missing guidance matter parent vaccinated child not. vaccinated parent still catch virus give child. Immunocompromised children hopefully parents still take precautions knowingly put risk. link study NEJM? I'm highly skeptical finding. vaccines use clever tricks may make better natural immunity (besides AZ vaccine, fact use stabilized spike protein fact spike protein best thing immune system target), can't fathom previous infection natural immunity completely neutralized SA variant. 

Depending sample size, entirely possible confidence interval includes 0, imagine data artifact (just like 100% protection hospitalization death clinical trials also statistical abnormality true value something 90s). Eh what? reason US perfect place there's large amount vaccinated people population herd immunity. They‚Äôre news: water wet. problem unvaccinated currently half population US ...   Thanks captain obvious.
3 weeks job.
Knocking right ball park. Masks definitely prevent catching spreading coronavirus. news. Water wet Bravo. Wish western countries balls this. child fine. Jesus Christ, fear mental wellbeing household potentially exposed covid. scared COVID want get vaccinated sorry zero compassion Next 11;

People without jackets likely feel chilly colder climates. news, sky blue. Ground breaking news Well might obvious type idiot doesn‚Äôt want get vaccinated *but also* wants stop wearing mask. That‚Äôs already happening. It‚Äôs happening since vaccine come out. longer feel guilty vaccinated taking care covid patients knew something could prevented illness couldn‚Äôt get it. Now, I‚Äôm dumbfounded every case admit hospital since entirely preventable. ... ok fair point. Restrictive? living restrictive conditions, put mask social distance, wash hands anyways lol. free-for-all here, people act like we've living sort military state, that's furthest truth.  hand, think one subset population, think increased pressure get it. Specifically vaccine-hesitant, puts firm choice hands-- get vaxxed get sick. sends message vaccine hesitant society getting ready move on, going wear masks protect forever.

If decide they'd rather get sick, there's nothing done. Hopefully they'll decide get vaccine like many others have. Yeah, guess would. noticed username made mask connection.  think asking care them... Uncomfortable probably better word

Either way,it's fundamentally experience playing mask.  haven‚Äôt vaccinated yet overages US.. thats personal problem point move lives. don't, live world, statistics usually guides policy Completely agree Dr. Gupta. latest series blunders CDC pandemic..

I'm surprised noone listening anymore. start something like? Many ""incendiary comments"" coming nurses, union message. can't send controversial anti-vaccine message expect pushback. Flu shots thing. Car seats 5-point harnesses thing. Wearing goddamn mask enough people gotten vaccine also thing going deprive 7yo child ""normal life"". Yeah, get impression that's anxiety talking. verify looking them, sure fakes created real loons, dream perfect plan enemy good plan.

And not? think people want absolute minimum thing benefit society receive benefits part society. Inadequate certainly relative Canada almost 50% vaccinated likely pass US first dose % 3-4 weeks. issue hasn‚Äôt vaccine procurement, it‚Äôs complete failure provincial government put forth reasonable policies like paid sick days (schools manufacturing facilities account like 70% cases something), instead shutting businesses little contribution spread.

Luckily, vaccinations ramping big time got delivery 4.5 million vaccines, accounts well 10% total population. mess soon. Ontario‚Äôs lockdown scheduled lift June 3rd, would imagine it‚Äôs lifted last one.

Edit: 50% partially vaccinated, fully. Kids likely get hurt car accident. keep home forever. assume never took kids car since concerned. source supports anything said would nice. question is, production ready go scale make difference? Rest world focused scaling production likely focus tried true vaccines already production process tuned high efficiency. Taiwan's outbreak B117. posit 70-85% US ever going vaccinated.

[122M already fully vaccinated, 157M least 1 USA total population ~330M. already way off, nearly 50% already vaccinated. /r/NotTheOnion material here. anything, current data points towards longer delay *increasing* effectiveness. However, standard length also effective, big deal either way. Ayyy lmao I‚Äôm Oceanside see bars ‚Äúpublic protest demonstrations‚Äù get groceries Yeah, know. think perspective reasonable.

They 2X likely died Covid flu much higher year, think single digit flu deaths year. 


Also risk acceptable would continue children wear masks? They're interested science all. want safety blanket. Putting mask soothing ritual. kids about. risk much tolerable people wearing masks protect others themselves. new policy forced reevaluate risks daily activities. maybe shouldn‚Äôt told everyone use honors system taking mask public. I'm seriously getting sick argument. Yes, life risks. COVID something power control people option get vaccinated. ability lower risk. Even catch virus get low load matter. I'm guessing every single person that's fully vaccinated get virus think breakthrough cases breakthrough... one getting tested fully vaccinated except famous people hence getting famous people breakthrough cases... end day even get virus asymptomatic can't spread cares?  Must live small town guess. Smiles happen occasionally live US, certainly ""every stranger accidentally make eye contact with"". would weird. Anti-Vaxxer say same. mean, everything comes enforcement. health department state government agency rule people must wear masks, sure, there's rule there's probably penalty breaking rule. relevant authority come admonish workplace, workplace unlikely change. understood anything aerosol transmission would know outside isn‚Äôt issue particles get dispersed wind. Think someone dropping food coloring glass versus swimming pool. glass water change colors, effect color pool. Aerosol transmission follows idea, scientists maintained outdoors virtually risk free.

If you‚Äôre vaccinated, none applies course since you‚Äôre extremely unlikely transit virus. ""no guarantee **maskless** person""

She's equating maskless unvaccinated. same. half fucking population vaccinated area. means half population totally fine go maskless. Absolutely. feel I've maybe clear - people entitled want I'm advocating harassing anyone choices. I'm saying bloke two masks goggles supermarket least next five years undeniably start looking bit mad people. Presumably he's already aware bothered anyway. Funny Americans suddenly seem forgotten works. One persons behavior pandemic affects entire society's risk due exponential growth limits hospital system. days since relaxing mask restrictions one chance guage affect Ro K. Instead US policy right purely dogmatic, based nationalistic emphasis independence day holiday usher return normalcy. pretty much India 3 months ago. Japan, cultural expected wear mask sick public areas. Maybe carry over. 

I dont see reason though sick, masks people around yourself. fair, vaccine rollout crazy. mRNA vaccines new one came incredibly fast, people getting time warned little knew it, like whether protected variants long lasted whether could get people sick even we're vaccinated. Add media 24/7 reporting confusion time, fears misinformation online, human tendency change mind even faced evidence, whole thing recipe disaster.

For literally every vaccine its: get shot, get disease, end story. I've suspect

Classic. That‚Äôs fine me. seem least aware it‚Äôs driven anxiety. 

Best luck you. want people die? Point mask mandates US affect unmitigated spread COVID India Yeah haven‚Äôt stepped foot US pandemic. n95/99‚Äôs whole time (aside beginning pandemic) available everywhere (required public transport/shopping). many offices remote. flu usually rips office someone‚Äôs kid picked school daycare brought this, create triggers rules based percentage vaccinated, instance: 75% population vaccination mask mandate lifted. require anyone checking anything, total vaccination count. Utah announced two weeks ahead schools require masks last week. So, last three weeks school went maskless. nephew chose wear mask, another child ripped mask threw trash.

Announcing early makes people either celebrate early panic. Goes ways. People used shame others wearing masks needed like beach parks ones saying ""it's choice, judge, let want"". Dude tag say every single time posts... makes life easier.. 

You realize airplanes recirculate air right? get air outside throw old air plane... plane literally flying tons air brought cabin air... yeah I'm guessing airplanes change still wear masks fine. It‚Äôs *essentially* impossible. It‚Äôs unlikely CDC doesn‚Äôt consider vaccinated people threat unvaccinated people. past weeks face. start April, others rolled frontline workers still trying get group 1A. There‚Äôs bunch news articles PA chose roll least densely populated areas PA top 10, changes perception situation. definitely touch premature. add ""people already covid"" diagram well.

That's I'm worried dropping mask mandate. assholes changed behaviors throughout pandemic, pretty good chance type immunity already infection due risky behaviors. news water wet Yeah man, say, agree that. People whatever deem appropriate health concerns. I'm advocating harassing people case obvious - I'm saying fully vaccinated person indefinitely double masking wearing goggles go supermarket appear overly paranoid. People sub love harping point, without realizing represents ridiculously small percentage population 100% vaccination even close happening. It‚Äôs better accept feel bad people anxiety this. must hard change behavior year. 

It's important compassionate towards people, extra cautious harm anyone else. care others? I'm a'hole.

Not everybody vaccinate. I'm still waiting opportunity. meantime want take 1 % die 1 % chance ICU big fat tube veins legs want use sports chance sudden unrelated heart attack long covid. Trump? Y‚Äôall really obsessed seems wondering Covid 19 vaccines particular feel way about? vaccines general? type vaccine could envision used future you‚Äôd comfortable with? Poland western country? well damn good thing CDC say vaccinated people remove masks mingle strangers public!

vaccinated people wear masks treat pandemic seriously losing shit CDC said vaccination protects carrier serious consequences exposure COVID19.

This good news -- vaccines work better expected! Instead large groups people freaking cannot tell others wear mask keep away public. Amen! Right - normal life pre-pandemic? Someone flu would gone around gotten someone cancer sick realized - think there's microscope sick behavior now. comments someone said want like Saudis wearing mask ü§£  I‚Äôm fully vaccinated. wear mask places required wear one state. wear places required wear one. vaccinated, wearing mask impact anyone else‚Äôs health. 

I personally think someone ridiculous wearing mask alone car walking street. Would harass it? No, I‚Äôm asshole, still think person silly. 

I think argument ‚Äúpeople need mind business‚Äù hypocritical coming people who‚Äôve spent year making mission mind people‚Äôs business. ok I'm genuinely confused legal standpoint. work trader joe's state dropped mask mandate we've told let people without masks been. although i'm ready drop mask i'm confused company break state rule, anyone educate this? care health health around me, care fellow man. It‚Äôs sad see lot needless death illness selfish

I care people also care themselves. people refuse get shots that's them. me. I'm lacking empathy I'm letting live decided decision. people afraid getting flu, flu shots accessible. walk pharmacies get it. incredibly cheap, free. reason worked home, online school, masked COVID much higher infection rate, much high death rate, vaccine it. flu shots every year revised combat flu. people don‚Äôt get it, easily can. reason COVID precautions flu, ability combat every fucking year. Don‚Äôt act like COVID flu same. not. like try make seem like think peoples lives insignificant. Gotta pull heartstring combat statement don‚Äôt like huh. Go get flu shot you‚Äôll fine, go tell friends family coworkers get flu shot they‚Äôll fine. [3]

Sall African leaders welcomed Biden administration‚Äôs backing patent waivers Covid-19 vaccines, saying would advance production Africa elsewhere. measures would allow pharmaceutical manufacturers make ‚Äúcopycat‚Äù vaccines without fear sued infringing intellectual property rights. 

But EU officials insist move address manufacturing knowhow technology transfers needed countries seeking build vaccine manufacturing capacity. Brussels also argued existing international agreements intellectual property already offer flexibility sharing vaccine IP, including possibilities compulsory licensing. agree. think they‚Äôll optional vaccinated people starting July. I‚Äôm guessing airlines require vaccine proof though, should. Kids literally get often bad, great. idea long term effects anyone - vaccinated adults wearing masks nothing scientifically benefit safety children unvaccinated. breakthrough rates stinking, amazingly low even - death/hospitalization rates nearly 0.

Everyone make decision, hard kids say ""I want wear mask mom dad aren't"" get that. 

Finally - anyone using fake card psycho. cards mean nothing best - meant tracking system individual forget.

Finally - mask big protector whoever's wearing - hurt. - end day - people wearing mask going anyway, adults teens going vaccinated are, point - good gonna get.

Meh... depends area (and age group). part, vaccines readily available. I'm 2 days away 2 weeks 2nd shot. Bro... feels like accomplishment last year half. Almost there. think caught COVID, afraid would put hospital. 2 days away, gonna huge wait shoulders. Well...

WHO said deadliest year yet.

History agrees.

And young children, easily spread new variants, allowed vaccinated means we're going increase selective pressure breakthrough infections...

So no. take babies stores, parent keep kids safe. Live life, seems like maybe people who's whole identity tied Covid politics. Good you. kids vaccinated yet protecting them.

They've pretty much guaranteed many kids kids get virus even asymptomatic. knows long term effects kids. lot debate herd immunity even is, 70 85 percent, especially accounting varients Grocery stores even unsafe. Like wonder acting childish limiting grocery shopping specific times days lol.

It's early drop mask mandates go shopping ffs. assume make assumption, you‚Äôll wrong half time, own. Outstanding scientific observation. me, it‚Äôs form anxiety, lack trust vaccines. one first eligible receive vaccine 14 months following precautions carefully, need ease back normalcy. Im still wearing mask indoors I‚Äôm adjusting without outdoors. I‚Äôm eating restaurants again, recently attended small gathering vaccinated individuals, flew plane first time since everything started. I‚Äôm easing understand anxiety prone individuals hesitant ditch mask entirely. sympathy people access vaccine aren‚Äôt getting it. That‚Äôs them. hate getting colds flu - plan wear masks I‚Äôm sick. don‚Äôt see people (I hope becomes norm), might cold/flu season mostly prevent touching face surfaces. loved sick year! That‚Äôs real difference here, may legit health reasons whereas maskholes depraved cult said so.  say less 40-50% population gets vaccinated, what‚Äôs yearly death toll going Covid? Maybe 200-300k tops? million health problems?

Most get vaccinated. Kids aren‚Äôt risk. Anyone left take precautions.

I'm including information Ya asked random woman put mask couple weeks ago said forgot car walked away. don‚Äôt even work there, live rural area. Yea, see freeways reducing speed 10MPH you? 

Similarly, mask mandates places cases going control despite vaccines, happening anywhere US. 

Not mention kids safe fine even catch COVID. get that? likely die hundred causes COVID. kids even common identifying documents like drivers license? willing bet $100 early birthday kid. too! I've met many drivers say get vaccine. 

Also illegal wear mask Uber. still mandate saying drivers riders need to. vaccines prevent almost infections occurring. long-term impacts get infection. Fair enough. respect response facts behind it.

I got mine FIRST day available, got Pfizer (a week quicker), I'm **still** fully vaccinated. 2-week period post-second-shot Thursday me. got lucky appointment, people wait weeks city. got 2 weeks later, got Moderna, even fully vaccinated next month. Yep, respectful ride share driver. driver/app asks wear one, wear one. They've put lot pandemic.

I'm happy proven wrong, understand mindset preventing virus that's killing disabling millions enough motivation, is. said vaccinated people get rid masks... except correctional facilities, homeless shelters, public transportation. course death sentence. know else death sentence?

Edit: furthermore whole point significantly higher chance contracting COVID suffering long term detrimental effects getting Complications vaccine. Plus vaccine get added bonus getting sick. Sorry downvoted. completely within rights that, harm anyone else.

""This could happen, take extraordinary steps avoid it"" good way setting public policy. counter point even difficult make sure unvaccinated people wear masks vaccinated people allowed go around without unless want start much harder type enforcement beyond enforcing people wear masks begin with.

Or, could let make decisions. risk lower less people carry it. CDC agrees said need wear mask vaccinated children leaving children home? 

I said leave kids hone said example left kids CDC guidelines would include enforcing unvaccinated people wear masks.

[Not laws require compliance health mandates statues.

If people breaking local mandates statutes police enforce. said, states moving update guidance match CDCs guidance. Science says protects (although wearer lesser extent), high-filtration masks (KN95, N95) easily accessible whereas beginning pandemic. People listening scientists doctors scientist doctor.

Um yeah, cdc become much political tool... figured low, honestly expect low. That's good news though, makes feel even better returning back normal.

CDC assumes venues enforce policy. post shows venues enforce policy none said check vaccination status. 

CDC also says masks still worn healthcare settings mass transit planes, trains, buses even fully vaccines either based well known mechanisms mechanisms develoent decades (and already used different type treatment) . vaccines multiple years trials make sense (seasonal flu jab formulated manufactured within short timeframe). Also 1.5 billion (Yes) doses administered. better proof safety anything else. Also even go clinical trials actually work. weren‚Äôt one criticizing people Reddit much dumb stuff?

None complicated. I'm sure people demanding couple months (then couple months, couple months, couple months, defined endpoint this) mask wearing fine dandy reopening businesses event venues full capacity? keep restrictions too?

Especially people ok everything else normal think must masks, think lot people overestimating impact masks. think people become psychologically attached pandemic security blanket signifier ""I'm someone taking seriously."" Masks help, sure, they're silver bullet we've seen renewed outbreaks states already dropped mask mandates, months ago. probably impact margins, much spread covid occurred outside venues mask mandates - much interpersonal interaction private homes. I've worn mask this, harshly criticized Texas North Dakota dropped mask mandates but... nothing bad materialized. new spikes. People filling ERs. Deaths kept falling (188 deaths per day Texas day mandate ended, 42 per day now).

When covid control, anything possible help mitigate worthwhile. lot immunity immunization infection, dramatically lower levels transmission, seen removal mask mandates negative effects already happened. Seeing happened states impact thinking, part helped push edge argument simply longer situation justifies emergency executive power impose restrictions society. democratically decided intervention, unilaterally decided one state. justification emergency unilateral action present anymore, imo, people large support anymore. Meanwhile New Jersey... *ugh* part agree CDC's new guidelines. think incentivize lazy apathetic get vaxxed (the anti vaxxers lost cause), important need start working way back pre pandemic way life.

Here problem though. took advice medical professionals got first vaccine offered me, j&amp;j. j&amp;j different mRNAs efficacy much lower. such, really much better suited protecting community, individual (ie shot low efficacy, everyone gets it, lowered efficacy matter.) Compare high efficacy mRNA. could say high efficacy mRNA much better job protecting individual vaccination larger community important individual protected. problem new cdc guidelines seem considering high efficacy vaccines. community vaccination rates matter, individual protected....But got vaccine depends others getting vaccine. known things would play out, would waited week got mRNA.

The CDC says made decision based science vaccines effective site low number breakthrough cases. curious percentage breakthrough cases j&amp;j. outbreak Yankees taken j&amp;j.

Am overreacting this? know Yankees tested positive asymptomatic. California get straight called confronted employees shoppers. Pretty interesting different places react I‚Äôm glad vaccinated people liars don‚Äôt wear masks anymore. feel safe now. NJ, I'm increasingly hesitant associate reopening projections Memorial Day (or specific predetermined date holiday), users done. want risk setting failure (very possible) outcome Memorial Day arrive, governor still maintains restrictions. such, I'm kind conservative predictions, expecting long side, i.e. early mid June, btw emergency mandate set expire. 

Obviously there's good chance could happen well that, possibly even Memorial Day, personally - I'm saying case *everyone* - I'd rather things suddenly turn *better* initially expected (a good surprise) *worse* initially expected (a bad surprise). CDC's new guidance blue glaring example former; actually expecting wear masks indoors June July NJ anyway, even Murphy's unexplained delay there's *too* big loss. 

Same logic Dr. Fauci uses makes cautious predictions often criticized overly pessimistic. He's *major* public health official, many missteps could lead poor track record cost career, prefers going ""safe"" side terms predictions. He'd rather things turn *better* predicted *worse*. clear safe vaccinated, carriers easily spread disease wherever go, likely go places without masks. get hurt virus, spread vaccinated.  sure? announced like hour ago!  load rubbish.

We'll see happens, waiting partially vaccinated become fully vaccinated might cautious move, unreasonable move. Fauci said lied American public need masks run masks hospital workers, determined enough said wear masks, asked said would lie Americans felt warrented get thought needed do.

COVID-19 never get fully eradicated 100% people never vaccinated free society. free wear mask time want. care neighbor get vaccinated, force neighbor wear mask whole life. God forbid ever hear good news right? reckon risk getting blood clot vaccine 1 1.3 million, data UK shows [262 30.8 million total doses AZ vaccine (23.3 million first doses, cases observed). rate 1 120,000 total doses, 1 90,000 cases first doses (per numbers). 

That's 14x likely '1 1.3 million' risk claims. 

If numbers vaccines whole, is, best, unintentionally misleading, quote total number, blood clot risk seen one two vaccine candidates (J &amp; J AZ), others. What!! real? see yet! I've seen multiple people word word sub say they're going keep wearing masks cause ""they're asshole want people think republican."" checks boxes say exist. work retail. wear masks now. guarantee requirement drops, still wear one, I'm getting absolutely shit on.

Especially community health centers lower income neighborhoods large immigrant populations. would advocate falsifying information... Hi. said blood clots vaccine 1 1.3 million risk. also account elevated risk women seem blood clots vaccine? ratio still different number women? 

It's confusing AstraZenca culled people 45 (especially women.) basically telling get vaccine certain age certain group risk/reward ratio imbalanced/skewed. Yet keep hearing people say get vaccine anyway. think underestimating many human beings gathering groups right now. one said masks perfect, certainly help. fair, wanting mask around mass randos... see logic that, way different friends family. Public transport planes airports nasty normal times people coming everywhere bringing shit them. understand masking scenarios. Masks help prevent spread droplets. That's it. stop spread virus itself, size virus much smaller mask block. lost argument basically trying go credentials making argument based ""importance"" particular institutions. 

I'm giving actual evidence. making appeals authority refusing discuss evidence. 

Again, 3 cases enough draw conclusion efficacy number, tiny sample size 1 2 cases would drastically change number. instead addressing that, say ""CDC Smart, therefore right"". efficacy vaccines seem indicate masks pointless. end crazy variant breakthrough winter, could see recommending booster made available, intents purposes, threat reduced lower infectious respiratory diseases, typically wear masks those. Moreover, we're heading season infections low even without vaccines. 

While maybe people would want to, see proper reason time. think it‚Äôs give time people get it, June 15th 2 months opened eligibility everybody provides opportunity get shots. Doubt it.

Get vaxed, start make tough climb normalcy.

This coming masker worn day CDC told to. covid denier. put mask back second CDC tells to. unfortunately similar anti-vaxers (though much lesser extent public safety), vast majority people believe want believe. ""Well 0% chance!!"". Sorry nothing 0% chance.

This we're seeing huge increases tree nut allergies overreactive immune systems United States, partly due overprotective parents taking proper cautionary steps early ages. expression, ""better safe sorry"" many unintented consequences itself. crazy people got used 9/11 type numbers deaths every days. Yup. two...   made comment many times, but: curfews military measure, public health measure. policy recycled anti terrorism/riot book. stunt politicians trying pose fathers nation. I‚Äôm gently describing ‚Äúall clear, masks‚Äù poof. understand it‚Äôs part huge process. Kind team doesn‚Äôt become champions one day... it‚Äôs tireless constant process tired seeing mean legitimate problem. NJ HI refusing adopt CDC mask guidance even providing date now? saw said May 29 CA said June 15. guys assholes start thread proceed one incoherent debates I've ever seen. followed keep going. let go. need get vaccinated now. need get sick, keep spreading unvaccinated people high numbers reduce chance variants. might get lucky herd immunity, British variant proving make unlikely. deal occasional flair immunity wanes pre booster people, hopefully bodies adjust recognize covid bit easily make less societal threat. path coronaviruses took becoming part ""common cold"".

I'd feel better mask mandates going away vaccine available everyone, including kids, overall spread got bit lower.. smaller pool unvaccinated potentially fuck things rest us, less people infect get sick (and, most, when, if. decent chunk antivaxxers need get sick keep levels spread down). good. :) Yep, masks considered voluntary start here. depends types changes make vaccine. said take whole third dose grain salt now. course companies want sell 7 billion doses vaccine. Doesn‚Äôt mean we‚Äôre actually going need  good already years data understand full scope post infections impact, take time machine, want ride  Well, can. called at-will employment. Clearly ok sneezed at, rest every patriotic American sneezing one another... twice. Wow, even worse we're talking public policy paying attention science. ""Vaccinated people need wear masks, even around unvaccinated people"" science says.

And escape notice ignored points made went condescending snark. I'll wear mask long mandated, I'll take mine off. wear security blanket makes feel better. ever try tell someone makes feel safe. Yep, one big Chickenpox party now. immunity dude. vaccines haven‚Äôt proven new variants Corona developed. Yes talking mask mandate. say metrics considering comes mask usage.  Feel free step away again.  makes feel better, moderna shots least intrusive least painlful shots I've entire life (I'm 40s). crazy quick. need supervised

Yes, trip target. shop online. concerned finding childcare shop, order online collect person. There's literally reason take kid target right dumbass decision CDC puts kids risks

Only parents take shopping. even then, kids tiny risk catching covid. Schools open assholes railing masks vaccines spreading disease going grow something protect others (wear masks vaccinated) beyond naive, negligent.

Those people already wearing masks. Nothing change except frontline workers confront anymore. asked quarantine home. That's mandatory. truly mandatory recent flare up.

Mandatory home/hotel quarantine, daily checks, police enforcement, digital fences. 

The recent flare asymptomatic flight crew slipped system. government dealing 10% positive rate, really shows they're undertesting.

That's statistics work, kid. Show 1 then.

The cdc said ""dont wear masks"" remove context nuance.

You right. wrong even though methane food smells. let's use vanillin furanenol aka smells vanilla strawberries common smells. still 3 orders magnitude smaller covid virus.

I mean guess right mask wet causing water enter air speaking, assume probably fairly damp. Yeah entirely dependent staff, depends area country. whole Costco no-mask altercation went viral last year 100% happened grocery store chains area. sign basically voluntary point. Ok heres quick reply since finding time proper one impossible.

No one knows neither survivability effectiveness vaccine trial phase set last several years. (Or maybe know people would getting sick dying pushing hard.) got information countries covid website, news, many instagram reddit posts discussing it.

What mean, get information vaccine effective life? long meant effective then??? thought 1 shot, booster shot weeks later, done. Like chickenpox. Unlike tetanus believe needs booster every 7 years. got information news.

I also know survival rate virus. tested myself. quoted official websites all, \~95% survival rate 65. appeal authority philosophical fallacy. got information personal experience.

I call bullshit official data. agenda, skewed fabricated data create echo chamber fear confusion. see government spokespeople getting worshipped heroes doctors patients going ignored. got information personal experience.

Sorry bullet points response rushed gonna come across conspiracy rambling points. (Disclaimer; I'm willing bet ANYTHING except going told):

\-Many people groups social media getting censored banned mention words covid, corona, vaccine, etc. 

\-Bill Gates/known depopulation fetish/used make money making viruses selling cure

\-the economic vantage pandemic elite

\-mass surveillance

\-people told stay indoors, contact, etc. sunlight, social contact, exercise etc important things health (you could still get alcohol fast food go gym church)

Ugh stand said earlier, find time I'll get sources explain coherently. I‚Äôve heard talks third vaccine dose potentially used several months road, may also account potential variants. know still hypothetical may even happen, curious, go route, anyone know something go testing, like initial doses did, something widely released distributed fairly quickly? Totally agree this. defended now, mask mandate needs end here. now, set firm date metric, needs soon. friend bitching CDCs decision online went party (maskless) week half ago.

The hypocrisy astonishing. 

And hate say cause people quick judge everyone everything days;  yes went party. Yes vaccinated. party adults afaik also vaccinated. Damn, must really affected you. I'm sorry hear it.

Keep mind though we're talking CDC guidance here. executive orders, lockdowns, mandatory testing. guidance CDC says, ""hey, still good idea require masks indoors around unvaccinated people"". reading way much comment. feel like people fine wearing piece cloth grocery shopping, maybe that's much ask. thing people US thought doing. told sneeze elbow. Even Asia SARS people started masking time going out. make $15 Target yea many us comfortable confronting guests it. worth risk, especially gun loving state. 15 year old eligible get 1st dose *this week* fully vaccinated mid June. still much risk refuse wear masks get vaccinated - especially Republican Governor decided fuck masks last week school ""see smiles"". think wearing masks herd immunity sounds reasonable. Vaccination rates aren‚Äôt high enough yet.  like novel virus anything months research versus century flu data.

That enough compel reasonable person cautious would flu thing wear mask couple months done it. 

It's fine smarter obviously, taking precautions stage stupid bad sub actually pretty positive overall. Good guys. that's thing causes it, inflammation vessles, less blood flow, they're dilating. many others PACS, rheumatologist confirm it. Let guess lot fatigue too? OGP employee told management began even allowed ask customer without mask back give space. first started putting 6 feet apart signage. reasonable person would know idiots would interpreted message way. actual results putting statement like important message actually said. CDCs fault. knew would happen.

It still may right call, can't divert blame. found 3.2% increase road fatalities attributable raised speed limits road types United States. highest increases rural interstates \(9.1%\) urban interstates \(4.0%\). estimated 12 545 deaths \(95% confidence interval \[CI\] = 8739, 16 352\) 36 583 injuries fatal crashes \(95% CI = 29 322, 43 844\) attributable increases speed limits across United Source actually banning people store this?  Children low risk. equivalent bad cold flu children. like Target gave shit anyways. Yeah blame them, wanted continue spread word people look like leper run without one haha know fully vaccinated people substantial risk anyone. whole reason restricting vaccinated people know posed risk, lifted mask requirements might cause outbreak. know that's going happen.

Most people follow rules. ones following anyway, lost much. people get vaccinated refused without demonstrable personal benefit. See mean? literally pulling nonsense ass. ""extremely likely fine"" üòÇ anymore pathetically full shit. 

See really point proove fucking stupid are? Certainly better we're Ontario 2000 cases/day. asking person posts every thread subreddit hobbies.posting comments 24/7 healthy. think also take break. I'm going bike ride now. good afternoon 7 year old 4 month old. can't risk either getting deal affect rest lives. also nice get sick past year since wear mask. thing is, may even correct decision overall. convince people get vaccinated, could save lives balance. 

But mean correct decision specific person community.  think confusion 2 days notice? month prepare actually involve?

Sure signage need removed, staff informed new policies, feel like people acting like much complicated businesses really is. # Translation

Herd immunity reached getting enough people vaccinated *or infected*. looks like CDC taking latter route antimaskers. entire argument vaccinated people can't socialize become depressed due still wearing masks boils ""most socializing happens restaurants bars""? realize socializing happens mean way socialize right? like options vaccinated people wearing masks are: Wear mask able socialize depressed can't go bar restaraunts stop wearing mask able socialize bars restraunts.

You socialize parks, beaches, hikes, someone's house, etc. still wearing mask. Also people still wearing masks vaccinated wearing 24/7 willing take eat drink, especially outdoor places.

It's silly try say vaccinated people wearing masks lead able socialize become depressed. many options socializing still. publication [this said, early results. exploration mechanism, power conclude so. early results highly suggestive little impact past infection another strain ability SA variant cause infection.

It'll take months us start getting clearer picture reliable data, extremely noteworthy early finding. could happen virus bacteria logic never take masks. matter new virus could come around tomorrow well. don‚Äôt make policies based ifs. get covid instead.

Emma dumbass get fucking vaccinated Idk fuck people talking about. kids, age possible vaccine, wear mask go store them, keep on, complain. get school mask 30 minutes grocery store to? hard, bribe treats video games, win win. assume talking mask use since seems clear date certain limits removed starting May 19th. Everyone interprets risk differently assigns different costs benefits associated variables play. 

I'm going continue wearing mask think COVID going kill point time. continue wearing one certain situations time would prefer reduce already low risk getting sick even lower level, perceive masks particularly disruptive. Others feel differently. Covid buddy. know works. Doesn‚Äôt mean don‚Äôt agree people‚Äôs personal freedoms. treat people equally whether vax not.

Exactly. 

Then vaccinated people say ‚ÄúThe CDC says wear mask medical reason literally pony show anti-vaxxers might do?‚Äù

It would epic shit show loss scientific credibility entire administration. mean it‚Äôs extremely unlikely- preventing kinda whole point vaccine it‚Äôs like you‚Äôre taking vitamin c know many others already said it, also OCD and, yes, really really hard year. obsessions beforehand mainly existential (do exist? exist?

The positive feel empathy germophobe types. obsessions getting back old themes I‚Äôm vaccinated, never forget year. So, case stay masked vaccinated. would take experts seriously came said advocating this, instead beating around bush.

There scientific reason vaccinated people need wear masks prevent COVID. entire argument continuing wear masks point unvaccinated people get idea wear masks anymore. say it, stop beating around bush. working entire Pandemic factory style job. think got Covid far, Vaccinated, know risk getting Covid-19 higher work indoors next lot people. suspect many refuse get vaccinated quite outright state that.

I've heard one two studies say workers type work among top 5 deaths, ask. get vaccine still get Covid, risk getting long term effects like blood clots? worry studies mostly based people isolate nearly perfectly people might go mess everyday.  like take shit‚Ä¶ 

Are going list obvious stupid things maybe try making valid point‚Ä¶ 

However you‚Äôre train it‚Äôs packed. 
It might make difference‚Ä¶ 

See logic.. mean know long-term side effects going be, long term yet. starting see troubling instances, data takes long time answer questions definitively. evidence ability say cause problem them, whereas reverse true well however say troubling signs. real question unknown enough quantitative risk safeguard children? mean know know, would take risk proclaim everything fine need time data, time might also like vaccine lotteries. Automatic entry shots, $1M prize 5-10 people. punish early vaccination crowd inspires folks get vaccinations now. I'd like see that. Yeah, new MRNA method pionerred Covid vaccines would vastly speed flu vaccine production, make accurate.

Right flu vaccines made mostly injecting viruses chicken eggs, waiting replicate inside egg, purifying virus particles egg whites vaccine. takes millions eggs six months time, there's lot guess work flu viruses going circulating heavily next winter. even picked correctly, flu viruses also mutate replication inside eggs...which throw effectiveness vaccines produced them.

Making MRNA vaccines instead would take week sequencing predominant strains start season (which also takes week), meaning vaccine going much targeted particular flu viruses actually going population. would easy enough double blind test - upgrade filters bunch randomly selected schools across nation compare test scores national average running average five years prior upgrading filters.

You even need worry consent, unreasonable school upgrade filters HVAC systems own. June gonna look nice, think 61 percent one dose past Friday. weekend numbers even better. First all, that‚Äôs good question. 

I think we‚Äôre end pandemic, least United States. that‚Äôs we‚Äôre really seeing numbers drop dramatically, predicted months ago. New hospitalization cases dropping significantly depending U.S. That‚Äôs two things- uptick vaccinations seasonal variability COVID-19 itself. think factors play role. think potential new variants, think see significant uptick numbers.  Keep home like been? guess I'm following.. would personally protest? dont agree vaccines forcibly injected people case covid 19. disease preys unfit old around 0.6% death rate. think that‚Äôs hold here. got goals upon goals pandemic, even got pushed back still goals, 70% number thrown around lot. suddenly it‚Äôs over. I‚Äôm team science, don‚Äôt exactly trust CDC. seem political tool aren‚Äôt afraid lying( see mask needed last year) announced airborne everyone mother knew months ago. mention previous mask guidance like trying solve math problem weeks ago.

Idk, feels weird blue. think like set date, like said ‚Äúby July 4th won‚Äôt wear mask‚Äù think people would comfortable easing transition back normal, rather suddenly going back it.

There also lot assholes sub basically sound like anti-maskers/Covid deniers last year. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm affected, mother can‚Äôt get kids don‚Äôt matter me, I‚Äôm living life! Trust science.‚Äù

Like wow, went whole year arguing compassion people ends lie. cared self family, safe longer care. Great message hypocrisy.

It‚Äôs okay feel like might soon feel little odd it. want move on, great, stop dick it. Yes are.  Yep see opening non vaccinated people walking around going stores public places without regard others safety. Waiting hurting anyone certainly restricting going get fat beer fries. Open shit back up, wear fucking mask go..the pandemic still alive well US ignoring it. Watch, going shut back fall winter risk children car accident still higher Covid, despite safety systems cars. doesn‚Äôt even include kids getting hit cars. want risks really minimized want lower speed limit 25 mph everywhere. equivalency want eliminate risks children. Thank this. research people gotten clots Covid shown anti phospholipid antibodies? APS - make prone bad outcome Covid? Thank something wish could talk amongst people actually believed pandemic real wear mask, without noise COVID deniers anti-maskers jumping arguments.

Not measures equal, didn‚Äôt much combat spread. example, late winter year, state shut aquarium museums, left open indoor dining. Prior shutdown, masks required times aquarium museums. Capacity limited, single case linked businesses. went aquarium mask usage strictly enforced. didn‚Äôt see single person masks even nose. everyone monitored floor make sure stayed 6 feet groups. didn‚Äôt, staff immediately asked step back.

Meanwhile, plenty studies around world showing indoor dining *main* driver spread. indoor dining allowed remain open entire time. Yet businesses, like aquarium, forced close even though people could social distance required wear masks times. think point point masks reducing transmission vulnerable population too. Idk said lockdown they're comparible preventative measures meant accomplish similar, comparable goals. Facts.

It‚Äôs peer states steep decline Florida keeps killing nationalist citizens. genie bottle. Whether like every state soon following CDC guidance (I believe 4 states comment indicated yet). you, vaccinated individual get decide do.  
 
The data clear, substantially reduced risk catching spreading covid, even greater reduced risk developing symptoms. think it‚Äôs quite irrational vaccinated person continue mask disagree CDC changing guidance (if reason disagreement lead non vaxxed people unmasking). Either way non vaxxed people unmask. choice vaccinated individual change that.  
  
But course everyone gets make choice doesn‚Äôt bother vaccinated individuals continue mask. one happy remove mask safely feel like increased risk meaningful way. Remember bit masks protect OTHERS? that's needed wear masks???? hate Abbott but, fortunately, state still heading right direction. 

Maybe Abbott's reputation would've improved stuck COVID patients nursing homes... hear ya. point may bit closer think? trying optimistic. wish public health colleagues didnt make biggest avoidable mistakes throughout pandemic first place. 

A lot physicians, major nursing groups, etc disagreeing CDC misguided advice, making messaging around PH advice difficult again. 

I hope there's massive review badly PH pandemic future generations PH physicians learn failures learn this. 

As community family physician, I'm lane already involves public health messaging one many roles patients, continue critique make jobs difficult inconsistent messaging. thank much. people want government mandate vaccine... cant even begin understand stance. thought whole point masks stop transmission self protection? science isn‚Äôt clear? Got suspect there‚Äôs reasons CDC dropping mask mandate can‚Äôt say due politics:

They know people never going get vaccinated period. It‚Äôs better go ahead get covid get natural immunity it‚Äôs summer hospital rates low. Covid, like flu, seasonal want avoid another huge wave fall winter. someone gets natural immunity now, least last winter, it‚Äôs permanent. natural immunity might help future variants deadly (as long doesn‚Äôt create them)


The CDC knows strongest antivaxxers wearing masks anyway. They‚Äôve written unreachable. CDC hoping new direction convince people left unmotivated get giving reward.


This unfortunate immune compromised, vaccination rates equal across country least vaccinated states lifted restrictions anyway. certain anti-science states want die, current administration probably like ‚Äúok, tried help. die, die.‚Äù


Also, huge: mask enforcement isn‚Äôt done police law enforcement, it‚Äôs done retail workers bus drivers. mandate enforcements fallen workers guns, tasers, handcuff, training. 22 year old greeter American Eagle supposed United States‚Äô guardian mask enforcement. mask mandate complete fantasy offload enforcement retail workers fed up, frustrated, probably making less $13 hour. Exactly. Great example! 

The fact reason lift mandates protect everyone anyone might harmed lifting mandates. takes nothing people continue wearing masks cause irreparable harm young children. r/science, r/technology, r/Coronavirus, r/coronavirus(state name), full ""studies"" answer commonsense questions. 
Breaking news: melting glaciers contributes raising sea levels. there's people comments talking like sort mind bending break through. Well proved completely unreasonable you‚Äôre being. way bigger risk factors kids COVID, would like see energy applied elsewhere, impact would much higher...  Florida spiking back up. know got information lie. go online department health Florida see damn self. really shouldn‚Äôt talk matter.  isn't. Oh no!!!!! ever live now. think hopeful outcome also serve ‚Äúcarrot‚Äù people get vaccinated. true all, I‚Äôve seen several people shopping without one. saw employee go one tell masks required, said medical exemption. End conversation, employee said okay walked away. Texas averaged 44.9 covid fatalities per day trailing 7 days (May 9-15), still Republican political theater.

I've seen 1 reported death May 16 now.

All all, numbers pretty good, life almost back normal Texas. People returning offices restaurants. 32.3% total population fully vaccinated, rate vaccine demand dropping.

Texas numbers:

* Population: 29,145,505 (2020 census)
* Confirmed cumulative cases: 2,929,393 (10.1% population)
* Confirmed cumulative deaths: 50,946 (1.7% cases) system naturally protects equivalent vaccine.

Do info could read, get friend? mean way sound heartless think way kids would die driving accidents covid. course theres long covid unknown plays case deaths think kids really risk here.

Having said kid think would, point parents family members vaccinated, I'd let go hang friends outdoors, otherwise stay inside play people online. OK that's never going happen  Shitty compared Texas.

Way daily cases deaths despite way less people.

They‚Äôve dramatic curve Texas California.

Pretty shitty given victory laps Governor. really, unless person using car seat... people really sound stupid parroting numbers CDC contradict argument. happy you! job couldn‚Äôt give definitive answer bc powers still mulling i‚Äôm counting i‚Äôm trying find something permanent. Woah weird see name town here.

Sorry I'm phone.

Anyway, since folks curious it.
Our town mayor working doctor, pushing vaccines get go ( great infrastructure vaccinate , even compared much bigger towns.)

When comes mandatory part it, pretty much Impossible pass region base, plans make places limits non vaccinated people (town hall example) big discounts town attractions :) Anywhere cases still active maskless unvaccinated idiots get sick. Hospital cases go up. We‚Äôll find two weeks. Ok then, back original argument, fat won‚Äôt kill neighbor. What‚Äôs argument here? Costs, health? Keep hydration good nutrition Tylenol handy second dose case get fever/chills. It‚Äôs generally recommended take **before** shot fine take post-vax discomfort, provided take Tylenol ordinarily (liver good shape etc). wonder much change would take get there, curiosity. 

I'm epidemiologist, molecular biologist. understanding something neighborhood ""This coronavirus more.""

A lot people outsized fear mutations new mutations (a) always get press (b) order drive clicks, press always indicates *might* evade vaccination/previous immunity.

The subsequent story actually, vaccine still works great, thanks, nearly widely heard quote lawyer once, ""corner cases make bad law.""

Right. *lot* people elsewhere really, really bad risk assessment last year (totally understandably!) default become ""do least risky thing possibly could."" fairly laudable June 2020, May 2021 good way set public policy going forward. mandatory 19 year old got day did. made point get appointments back back. Congress power pass laws ‚Äúprovide common Defence **general Welfare** United States‚Äù. literally ‚Äúgreater good‚Äù written constitution.

There many limits power, mostly laid bill rights (and think compulsory vaccination runs afoul limits), claim US power something greater good utterly absurd. wonder many anti-vaxxers anti-maskers way identity politics, private actually believe COVID real something screw around with. now, they've able way others protecting them. mask mandates going away, hand forced. comment automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

I lol'd. going complaining regardless. CDC could‚Äôve waited August post recommendations, people would‚Äôve still said ‚Äúit‚Äôs soon.‚Äù principle issue CDC's recent mask guidance issue CDC's guidance quite time: CDC insists trying make value-judgements risk-judgements Americans, rather giving Americans information need make better decisions. 

This illustrated low-stakes example: CDC's [food safety CDC says food ""safe"" cooked high enough temperature. Whole cuts beef ""safe"" 145F. temperature also called ""medium well"" - steak pinkish-grey, started dry out. absolutely true risk food-borne illness lower eat steak cooked 145F one cooked 130F (medium rare). time, many people feel steak cooked 145 dry overdone - worth eating. **How much safer** 145F steak 130F steak - like steak cooked 145F, reasonable risk occasionally eat one cooked 130F? There's way tell CDC's guidance - simply say 145F ""safe"", implication anything cooked lower temp ""unsafe."" shit. absolutely held accountable public . Public voicing concerns prompts appropriate organisations take action. 


Astra Zeneca decision making long time. UK late party, pushed vaccine much possibly could whole vaccination programme based AZ vaccinations.  


'smart people' make mistakes plenty rational smart people make decision based available data. like doctors, make mistakes wise ask second opinion think may wrong often, patient right asking second opinion.  
Just like AZ vaccine, plenty people made decision based personal risk vs benefit analysis. That's bodily autonomy comes. people mind risk vaccines, others do.  
By taking away bodily autonomy, forcing someone take risk may best interest. can't take away bodily autonomy fits narrative. sets dangerous precedence. Would speaking way vaccine available Sputnik Chinese one? get decide people bodies.  


The nothing approach getting really tiring quickly. 'greater good' approach annoying frankly, dangerous. age group kids best immune system disease. children mild symptoms symptoms decision pushes burden states Biden CDC. Michigan example, nothing changed since CDC's announcement. Social distancing big thing. think underestimate toll distance social society people anyone saved lives vaccine developers? get Nobel prize. think folks follow rules better public still seeing family weird Covid pod things. According ? What's point ? vaccinated person, really care know I'm vaccinated trust protects family virus. concern though fellow man vaccine hesitant. time, point pandemic, kinda ""on you"" (or kid kids probably fine anyways imo) vaccinated.

Either way seems bit premature it'll lead deaths **but** still trust family okay, something I'm for. I'm exactly selfishness alternative literally wearing piece cloth. hey promise next time I'm gym I'll lifting maskless.

As someone inside 13 months last year protect 3 high risk people life idea wearing mask otherwise going really bad kinda ridiculous get agressive hate. hey again, I'm fine, families fine, made it, we're gonna make it, care going maskless people. Guess won‚Äôt going target anytime soon. Amazon must giddy right Well know impossible means word missing statement won‚Äôt insert assumptions draw conclusions based point I‚Äôm trying make. 

And Cdc saying ‚Äúwe still learning‚Äù ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt know‚Äù. doctor considered ‚Äúpracticing‚Äù always learning. That‚Äôs medical science. It‚Äôs fluid constantly changing. 

So again. cdc never said ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt know‚Äù far tell, person arguing never used word impossible. 

Don‚Äôt come people accusations ‚Äúagendas‚Äù problem putting spin things. probably telling truth state 15 percent people work refusing get it. Also nurses hospital refusing. state barely break 50 percent guarantee it. Lol do. nearsighted. relative live. 

Sure small town wearing mask park almost useless. 

Unlike live NYC Central Park used thousands daily safest. 

See difference. 

Using common sense respectful took yet couldn‚Äôt care‚Ä¶ Arnt seeing children new variants too? Tampa/St Pete absolutely see anyone complying.  many mandatory establishments, like hospitals schools. So, 14 year old. Thanks. What? forcing mask compliance amongst vaccinated show benefit vaxxed? 

The change guidance makes sense. great, get harassed tucker carlson watchers? can‚Äôt get vaccinated yeah I‚Äôm little stressed Fuck kids 12 rite? 

As parent 10 month old terrifies matter vaccinated. not, keep wearing mask. gov doesnt actually care boring ass lives lol Yeah, best look. I'm sick ignorance self righteousness antivaxers people following safe practices.  discounting already Covid - estimated around 1/3. puts immunity 50% close 60% cases dropping quickly. vast majority remaining either won‚Äôt get vaccinated minimal risk (kids). Well there‚Äôs scientific evidence curfews work since you‚Äôre simply restricting freedom movement certain time day. Apart point consequences future since set many precedents last year. pressure wear masks. Yes, everyone complied, get stared at. Now, social official pressure opposite - masked people stop. 

It's simple say ""they listening CDC anyway."" There's lot people would wear mask everyone else is, nobody else is. Define significant UK..... Looking Worldometers see much. that, UK process reopening right now? many 40 year olds received shot? 

The US UK similar percentages vaccinated things still quite different countries. point surprise me. Biontech currently working updated Version vaccine stored normal fridge.

The cooperation two companies (and others) amazing shows international cooperation overcome lot hurdles.

Edit:
And like always 100% right - thanks good work sub! anti vaxxers numerous ever before. figured pretty much coworkers antivax. think it‚Äôs time find job that‚Äôll let work home.  want use us leverage force mask compliance unvaccinated.

No. trying get vaccine hesitant people get vaxxed showing benefits vaxxed. Extremely effective- tests say effectiveness UK variant 90% CDC never said unvaccinated people unmask.

If don‚Äôt want ‚Äúhonor system‚Äù local groceries government still implement mask mandates combat it. 

Either people mask (unvaccinated) unmasked, vaccinated people needlessly continuing mask. see argument either way, point it‚Äôs CDC‚Äôs job make decision. That‚Äôs really businesses local government.

The CDC‚Äôs job deliver information help people (and businesses government) make decisions themselves. closed like April til September longer was. no, see. Hope figure soon. subreddit among people got medical degrees Facebook, lot opinions causing harm children making wear thin piece fabric problems wearing.  went mask 100% time outside apartment pocket 'just case' yesterday...I almost cried walk yesterday, really struck leading normal life whole time. I've all-aboard whatever CDC says entire time, never viewed mask measures truly inconvenient, found yesterday kind lying myself. Fresh air really something else, let tell you. hope everyone stays safe healthy makes good decisions, think going back might break me. switched curbside shopping; definitely see entering Target/Walmart fewer 5 times per year going forward, really missing anything. call take stupid. Maybe wrong. point, though; eating healthy whole life takes effort spending hours, days, getting vaccinated dealing side effects.  OCD thing going brutal. minor degree tough trying work begin accepting people wearing masks indoors going forward need get back life. Like, try rationalize vaccinated exposed (most likely) protected. 

It's baby steps sure stuff \~6 months ago, flip side still super skeptical unmasked amongst people are.

I'm sure wait little longer 12-15 group vaccinated least. nothing prepare for. say didn‚Äôt agree vaccinated people couldn‚Äôt wear masks? cdc shit together making people doubt entire pandemic fault. cdc said masks many countries experts disagreed mask usage proven effective cdc changed. one answers right learning virus fight that‚Äôs abundance caution used. can‚Äôt realize problem enough population vaccinated may never get bc anti vaxxers don‚Äôt know tell you. care immune compromised kids people risk due mask mandate change. i‚Äôm vaccinated i‚Äôm good don‚Äôt want see cases spike situation finally improving. hope i‚Äôm proved wrong doesn‚Äôt happen. time tell. use people's risk appetite children pre-covid. flu dangerous kids mask kids before. Think terms risk budget. Driving kids store uses budget, bringing store unvaccinated unmasked people uses even more. 

The fact car ride riskier store visit negate risk store visit. simply add top other, creating even riskier trip. get really annoyed people home state compare COVID results Florida ""proof"" we're wrong... Florida lower complication rates respiratory diseases, one many reasons old people retire there. Weather makes difference (as air pollution i'd imagine) Thanks!  seems media taken new mask policies bad nurses complaining. don‚Äôt think need /s anymore talking Indian politics leadership BJP definitely management thing.

CDC epidemiologists commenting food safety? guy shit point keeps evolving argument. good point. northeast states (NJ, NY, New England) dropping restrictions time seems reasonable thing do. 60% vaccinated likely another 10% recovered, herd immunity possibly reached (or reached near future) areas. Ah ok. That‚Äôs good. I‚Äôm referring Greenville area. Yeah really don‚Äôt think cdc magically forgot 12 don‚Äôt vaccine option think you‚Äôre right modeling infected + vaccinated

You give people much credit, know well anti-vaxxers people first go without masks. public spaces total unknown, basically assume people vaccinated get whole family vaccinated.

But point last year sub said wear mask times even outside you‚Äôre single-handedly responsible murdering old people. say that, anything close it. put words mouth.

What I'm pointing scientists different opinions this.   problem doesn‚Äôt make sense me. What‚Äôs difference people‚Äôs germs post office vs. germs public transportation? Either vaccinated people safe aren‚Äôt, saying germs somehow change depending doesn‚Äôt make sense. keep putting words mouth. I'm advocating wait 100% people, would like see essentially 50%. lazy anti-science folks ones never followed guidelines begin with. issue keeping masks while, hurt anyone. open things up, cannot safely operate unless people still masked. There's lot kids vaccinated yet either, leaving safety back burner lifting mask mandate right now. Waiting summer would keep numbers going without endangering fun times summer. really hard. seem pressed idea keeping mask struggle, I'm suggesting stay public spaces indoors, we've doing. great spot, keep going instead impeding progress we've finally started make?

I'm really sorry agreement really point goal. really care feel riskiness facts:

[As 6 a.m. EDT May 17, total 122,999,721 Americans fully vaccinated, 37 percent country's population, according CDC's half country vaccinated. 

And health care system much slack. areas struggle capacity pandemic. pandemic, many health care workers died quit. reduces capacity even further. 

[Here's much slack existed super infectious variant spreading, absolutely risking hospitals. idiocy believe otherwise half country remains unvaccinated.

And hospitals overwhelmed, percentage population overwhelmed Los Angeles? less half. Yes. receive medical services don‚Äôt pay sued. Redfield one biggest pieces shit.

The govt isn‚Äôt everything get people vaccinated. They‚Äôre kind giving up. make okay make assumptions.

I really try divide people one category other. two sides (IME) alike probably realize. would like see active food preparation workers wear masks forever.

They remove register. understand public health experts coming from. want get case counts low possible, basically levels seen Asian nations. CDC otoh feel that's realistic re-opening. They're okay minimal number US plateaued at. 

I think Biden administration really trying balance re-opening broadest extent possible, exacerbating spread. particular they've realized economic effects pandemic hitting lowest wage earners hardest, service businesses/firms shuttered operating half capacity.

ITT: everyone falsely thinking CDC said need end mask mandates ignoring important advice unvaccinated need remain masked saying local leaders need decide carried out. vaccines prerequisite children admitted preschools elementary schools? different traffic laws?

BTW, local regional administrations issue ordinances, regulations, guidelines ultimately courts administrations get sued. that's NPR source established Doctor giving opinion, none claims backed CDC. says right article linked. know data says relatively safe do, know limiting exposure viral load greatly increase ability body prevent possible infection. know nothing 100% either way, everything prevent non-symptomatic carrier. Saying wearing mask pointless true statement either. Show double blind, peer reviewed study vaccinated people wearing masks VS without 100% matching efficacy results. know I'm right basic scientific principles already establish past year. also even considering variants popping up, one requires analysis VS vaccine. also add live densely populated area.

Dude one giant strawman. arguing cars dangerous lets worry anything else dangerous. understand concept compound risk right? logic, might well everything ask risky getting car since already getting car. That's multiplying risk friend. They're delaying deliveries countries without stupid ass power too. deliberate strategy vaccinate first. NO!!!!! thought consensus kids aren‚Äôt primary victims, absolutely spreaders. 

Same PTSD..I opted ride double pneumonia home, though. Two weeks eating sleeping wondering death. ""media"" really great job gaslighting people thinking we've always war east Asia. Rather looking anything objectively. Objective news media longer kinda synonymous.

We wonder populace divided shit, cause choose fucking competing cults COVID-19 virus currently pandemic of. means chances bad mutations, there's many people infected.

Ignoring pretty dumb.  vaccinated. pose risk anyone else. I'm going enjoy life without mask. 

If problem that, that's bad. Children rarely ID birth certificates prove identification. think were! emphasizing good news trends. Science didn‚Äôt say end mask mandates. CDC explicitly said mandate end masking. said it‚Äôs local leaders decide do.

I'm gonna keep wearing mask stores while, employees, parents treat stores like playground. There's shortage outdoor things kid. Leave child home take personal responsibility. Hey Doctor! Thanks this. saw mentioned another comment risk blood clot outpatients covid 1 100. sounds incredibly high ‚Äî¬†it would mean there's upwards half million people US suffered blood clot due covid last year based latest case number estimates UT Southwestern. accurate? weight blood clot distribution leaning towards elderly covid complications are? Gotta dance like one watching.   great! Thank Dr. Spyropoulous!

1. someone (Person 1) normal levels blood platelets experienced drop first dose Oxford Astrazenica vaccine, would recommend take second dose another vaccine?

2. Would advice someone (Person 2) naturally low level blood platelets avoid Oxford Astrazenica vaccine? so, vaccine would recommend? recommendation change Person 2 already one dose Oxford vaccine experienced increased frequency headaches?

3. someone (Person 3) suffered floaters eyes first dose Oxford vaccine, recommendation going forward regards second dose? Yes, though often hospital sells debt debt collector fraction face value, debt collector one sues threatens sue Yep, make sense make assumptions I'm ready get rid mask. I'm Broomfield maybe 1/4 people King Soopers wearing masks yesterday city removed mask mandate. cost locking country down

no Pretending COVID virus world result deadly mutation ignorant constantly disproven. Countless virus mutations happen every day every virus planet. COVID-19, SARS MERS occurred. Good luck wiping every virus world. contagious diseases obesity cause?? Haven‚Äôt sick 7 years, barely wear mask. live Florida. I‚Äôm republican. AMA  worked target last year huge covid outbreak among team members. Yeah good luck workers.  Caution factor subreddit put feelings perceived rights.  put minor inconvenience couple months even minor gain, FREEEEE now?  mean, might save 1000s lives something couple months year.  Oh care suits god actually bioweapons; madmen it! Ok month now? 3 months now? That's silly response. lets roll dice kid's health even though something could control society. impossible calculate risk way know spreading shit maskless. Also death, stop strawmanning, long term health issues. roll dice time parents puts child car. yes, I'm also talking long term health issues. also instances people getting car crash suffering long term health issues give people much credit, know well anti-vaxxers people first go without masks. public spaces total unknown, basically assume people vaccinated get whole family vaccinated.

Of course. I'm willing take chances means, safe vaccinated, fuck everybody else.

It's also get deadly automobile several times week. mornings, crave nice cup coffee. know could safe thing make home, coffee shop street makes better, get car risk lives children cup coffee.

I also plan get hair cut later week. place I'm going within walking distance, feet get tired humid outside, I'll getting car risking lives children could get haircut. mask mandates age based. based location, state, business, etc. school policy need clause talked vaccinated people. schools policy updated mention vaccinated yet. clearly seem worried efficacy AZ vaccine relation variant. quite concerning.  people free so. expect norm crazy. thank you. That‚Äôs awesome! Life getting back normal Sorry long ACTUAL FUCK PEOPLE.

So many susceptible conspiracy theories COVID deniers vaccine microchip nut jobs.

You don‚Äôt like something happens it‚Äôs ‚Äúthey‚Äôre inflate jobs numbers!‚Äù ‚Äúits ploy incentivize people get vaccinated‚Äù.

That‚Äôs conspiracy nut jobs do‚Ä¶they disagree something come far fetched, dramatic explanations explain case condemn certain people actions.

How simple truth: 

*The CDC job reported scientific evidence. *

Evidence pretty simple, undeniable truth: Vaccinated people greatly protected virus even asymptomatically infected, spread others.

All report put guidance. That‚Äôs it! honestly that‚Äôs want report facts public.

I certainly don‚Äôt want exaggerate minimize things particular desired effect. never try influence behavior specific direction, seemed like past (outdoor masking) they‚Äôve roasted it.

What want simply told what‚Äôs going on. risks? pretty safe conditions?
It‚Äôs individuals, businesses, governments make decisions based facts.

I mean seriously want information becomes available? What‚Äôs alternative?

In particular case (masking vaccinated individuals), would rather CDC hold back information everyone continue wear masks time longer? sounds lot like manipulating information control population. Think bad idea is.

If you‚Äôre worried true facts make people do‚Ä¶maybe disagree decisions people, business, local government, either deal entities decisions get it.

Don‚Äôt blame scientist passing along facts!

Blaming and/or suggesting scientists silenced regarding certain findings fucking batshit crazy.

You wanted people trust science COVID before. don‚Äôt like science might bring, want changed muted.

GTFO nonsense.

Note: copy/pasted another related thread. least cases spiking area might scare people getting vaccinated? likely justify it, either. 

Why think many people distrust experts? Surely nothing repeatedly obviously lying ""for good""... Neanderthal! 2 100,000 children affected this. Please live rock rest life, going outside clearly dangerous family. 

2,600 cases nationwide 33 leading deaths? you‚Äôre telling others get educated? data support you. child abuse. kids *12, point taken swimming pool. found last February March. Perhaps issue adenovirus vaccines makes production much difficult estimate. Though, fairness J&amp;J know production issues Baltimore plant whereas companies contracted produce AZ said fulfilling requirements I‚Äôm disappointed. Target didn‚Äôt (known) plans change late yesterday. ""Show card HR."" seems like best do. one three things happen. Case levels stay same, case levels go down, case levels go up.

Which one predicting everyone stops wearing masks? 

I pick number 3. difference type clotting caused birth control pills type caused vaccines? Mask wearing crowded train stations Asia far norm. 

Here‚Äôs video Tokyo subway station 4 years ago: Barely 1/10th passengers seem wearing masks. Presumably sick still go work, cause Japan... That‚Äôs true, wearing masks helps protect others well. kids wearing masks, protection still reduced. due COVID restrictions, masks. Dropping COVID restrictions one thing dropping masks another. I'm arguing keeping COVID restrictions longer. think wearing mask low effort mitigation tool. simple truth: CDC job reported scientific evidence.

It may seem like nit, important distinction make here. comes setting public health guidelines, CDC emphatically reporting scientific evidence. CDC reporting guidelines thinks Americans follow achieve good public health outcomes. scientists policymakers write guidelines interpret scientific evidence, forms core decision-making process. scientific evidence combined public health data, sociological data, risk-judgements value-judgements decide guidelines published. spamming comment? ‚ÄúJimmy studied chemistry, Jimmy more. thought H2O H2SO4‚Ä¶‚Äù No, accept safe enough wear mask vaccinated long unvaccinated continue wearing mask. believe CDC say that.

But going happen CDC says happen. got away killing 600,000 people, decided bother trying. US government interest takes protect people, they‚Äôve decided wash hands whole thing. Plus might bummer kick house longer financially support you. statistics say 40% country vaccinated once, 40% adult population, full population, what? doubt going store main reason vaccinating kids. rather kids ability enter society large normal basis. CDC publicly stated based high powered studies Israel US vaccinated people spread virus. begging bribing son get it. He's 19 ""too busy"", ""will soon"", ""will fine""..... told I'd give $100 get it. He's antivax, thinks he's invincible. frustrating. 

Wish could help kid. mortality rates getting people sick rates. nuanced

we need trust CDC pandemic, generally inept shitty do

but CDC historically completely inept bendable political social pressures. seeing rescind mask mandates = social pressure, based science. scientist studied CDC literally advised bioterrorism/pandemics 2008, entirely inept group scientific review properly. may gotten bit better since actually took steps toward things pointed them, entire pandemic would've preventable... now, knew stuff pandemic happen? easily stifled controlled GOP/Trump early people stopped trusting them... fucked science number times past year lost trust. bending dumbest people world anti-maskers basically ensuring virus start spreading un-vaccinated population. disgusting see Hello Dr. Spyropolous. 

Should people JAK 2 Mutation delay getting vaccinated already susceptible clotting due condition? case, [they disagreed past. Vaccines aren‚Äôt 100% 

Little harsh call people names get breakthrough infection think earlier signs Aspirin decreasing deaths Covid-19 patients due reduced clotting? leading experts disagreed CDC government guidelines continuously throughout pandemic i‚Äôm sure kind flex thought was. epidemiologists largely recommending continued mask use emphasizing need higher vaccine rates need children still included vaccine roll safely roll back mask mandates. say can‚Äôt bare minimum others wearing mask go. CVST October. history CVST make likely experience thrombolytic event contract coronavirus? mask mainly protects spreading others, way around. anything minimize chance reaction vaccine? SAME. 2 year old barely seen people‚Äôs faces public half life. real harm everyone kid sees back 3 paces shield face. avoid worst case scenario know plenty people mild asymptomatic infection (which vaccines moderately protective against) end long term negative health effects. It‚Äôs year still much virus don‚Äôt understand. 

The quick vaccines emergency stopgap prevent tragedy we‚Äôre witnessing. know, probably million Americans dead get real handle numbers. Yes, lot countries (maybe Poland too), take steps reduce morbid obesity child obesity. 

It's exactly systemic problem here, yeah, already noticed somewhat serious manner. point many avoidable health issues affect people person directly example, taxing sugary beverages better labeling food products.

Taxing sugary beverages in-line general cash-grab current polish gov, health motivated serious manner.  medical advice, reports people multiple vaccine injections (like got Pfizer, went later get Moderna J/J) adverse effects. Also, COVID vaccine trial participants told clear get another dose won‚Äôt harmed - friend part late trial study J/J got Moderna vaccine work months later issues. 

This tricky one, you‚Äôll make whatever decisions feel comfortable with. There‚Äôs wrong answer.  good idea?

I'm hardly proponent facebook exactly thing? already local community groups it, whatsapp lesser degree.

I guess fail see hook would get people use another social media app, people already quite hooked current ones. agree. It‚Äôs hard figure much casual mask wearing distancing contributed people also avoiding kind social contact year. ‚ÄúWe yet know clinical implications elevated biomarker children COVID-19 symptoms minimal symptoms,‚Äù said co-senior author¬†David T. Teachey, MD, attending physician, Co-Leader the¬†Immune Dysregulation Frontier Program, Director Clinical Research the¬†Center Childhood Cancer Research¬†at CHOP.""

If want keep kids hermetically sealed bubble another year go ahead, know probably mental harm amount physical harm COVID would cause them. 

Also remember chickenpox pretty serious common long-term effects actually proven documented.  misleading take. Yes could make argument laws benefit society whole securing freedoms liberties individuals.

We dont make laws ‚Äúfor greater good‚Äù take away individual liberties. would unconstitutional.

Jesus christ like people never taken basic high school level civics course. Seemed ambiguous social distancing ... possibly indicate drop too. huge implications would essentially mean clubs could open. still midnight indoor curfew 31st is.. dumb. need also look beyond death statistics. Life-long COVID issues affect heart lung want kids getting it. Two weeks people got vaccinated opened general public full immunity. means essential workers opportunity full protection vaccines workplace people maskless. COVID projections also tapering two weeks.   Exactly!!!! guy follows dollar, science.  issue hit two weeks second dose week. I‚Äôm sure lots people still two week period need second dose still.

So people continue wear masks they're 100%. swear, get ""never return normal"" attitude. worn mask since CDC said ok... Well basically haven't. hate stupid thing. I'll wear stores still require others peace mind I'm gonna stop wearing mask. won‚Äôt obviously announcement bizarre timing awful. agree date announced people time digest news states businesses could prepared.

All announcement cause confusion ensured businesses scramble figure new guidance. Allergies big issue.

I know people say would loved mask April/May afraid look weird.  swear, choice information bad things people.

Imagine choice protect child *today,* screwing around want pick choose highly effective vaccine get.  Going probably still take little bit non box stores remove masks good step. local bike shop still requires them. feeling small businesses last drop mask requirements. talking masks, lockdowns. sides argument fight about. Tout science fits narrative blow doesn't. 2021 right now, champ. I'll definitely relieved infant daughter get it. weeks, could wait people, could wait more... see that's going right? hopeful outcome everyone unvaccinated continues wear masks vaccinated.

What might really happen? disease going start ramping among people vaccinated start filling hospitals again. Oh, always risk mutation makes vaccine less effective. tell us exciting new results studies you‚Äôre involved in? impactful finding date?  people ridiculous argument. Yes, get car. ride without seatbelts infant car seats go whatever speed want? No. Why? take safety precautions. GTFO nonsense non-argument ""what about"". know someone still cannot smell 8 months recovering. doctor doesn‚Äôt know do. doubt people without vaccines never wore masks people stores without masks on. vaccinated people, responsible know better

the CDC fucking lot past year hard point need trust them. bended political social pressures rather actually follow science, though inept general bad scientific review well Considering US still travel open 75 countries extremely small portion global cases variant thwarts vaccines would almost certainly still get us originate look MIS-C it‚Äôs relation COVID young kids see initial comment idiotic. Person covid: I‚Äôm gonna beat this

Doctor: Oh you‚Äôre not! *wack*  think may accidentally word two above. Masks off, dicks out! Let's f\*cking go! getting downvoted think right. didn‚Äôt end influenza even year global restrictions, almost international trave, etc. 

To actually end would need harsher restrictions already longer. Hard justify flu.  Back February people would accuse strawmanning said others going constantly move goalposts, yet see posts like regularly even deep May high vaccination rates. course not. Nobody does.

But life contains non-zero level risk. 800 children per year drown, don‚Äôt mandate adults close pools case. Parents lifeguards take responsibility managing acceptable level risk, don‚Äôt tell everyone else inconvenience it.

At five children/week, put it, comes 0.000007% children week. That‚Äôs zero. Close enough zero asking anybody else inconvenience based microscopic level risk child asking much.

Not mention risk lower last year, even numbers stated overestimate minuscule risk.

What level risk willing accept calculate it? can‚Äôt zero obviously impossible. one worked management didn‚Äôt give fuck it. talked manager suggested covid would disappear election, left shortly after.  too, friend!! Remember take good care yourself. Try it. worst case scerario refuse you, maybe it'll work. wondering red areas doing. blue area see one single person without mask today Post Office, Dollar Store, Walmart. one. I'm glad people using heads.  going monitor vaccinated? Yeah, private policy shaped public policy (see title post).

My questions choose answer them, bit random

1. review brief history development understanding blood clots key factor Covid? don‚Äôt know known beginning developed time.

2. surprised amount blood clotting caused COVID? something expected coronavirus?

3. clotting issue mild cases? 

4. explain basic mechanism causes clots? recall stories operations remove clots clots formed clots removed.

5. find simply taking aspirin worked prevent clots developing?

Thank work. get second astra Zeneca shot - decreased risk second shot?  would sue they're great parents otherwise would probably really heartbroken Care cite assertions? Walmart Sams, wrong . vaccinated carrry enough viral load infect people. push get people vaccinated. working, many vaccinate are. fine 80% need. live CA friends who‚Äôve issues getting appointments. also know people live states finally able get first dose weekend. think varies county county. got second dose days ago ( fully immune two weeks) booked first appointment day opened everyone 16+. Like said though top everyone eligible yet all. 16 still can‚Äôt get vaccinated. keep hearing ‚Äúit doesn‚Äôt matter‚Äù line, disagree. studies I‚Äôve read put risk reduction infected full vaccination anywhere 80-90%. That‚Äôs 100%, avoiding hospitalization death *not* concern one virus. It‚Äôs reasonable want infected virus left upwards million people U.S. long-term symptoms, many mild acute cases.  given reason, feel like burglar care stores policy though. start insulting prove wrong, point Lol getting car kid far far dangerous yet take risk every day I‚Äôd wager experience, top signs symptoms DVT PE? major risk factors developing blood clot?   two completely different things. pitch masks, least them. Keep em around cold something still need public. think ‚ÄòTexas reports‚Äô questionable part story. don‚Äôt know think Texas reports represents happens Texas. Something something moral superiority. Pot kettle black? don‚Äôt see makes huge difference. kid young vaccinated regardless vaccinated people wearing masks. People aren‚Äôt going get vaccine done masks feels like. Social distancing continue effective masks preventing transmission

I don‚Äôt see requiring people largely can‚Äôt get transmit virus wear masks changes much that. Childfree single. Murphy pretty much set date soon. anything indefensible. say someone thinks Murphy done solid job things considered. told I‚Äôd revaccinated fall widely circulating virus develop vaccine resistant mutations. benefits going store outweigh risks getting COVID? knowing protected great reason wait. don‚Äôt know recent states were... Seattle, majority adults got second shot two weeks ago...  time people vaccinated first (i.e. frontline workers) need re-vaccinated approaching year? know of. Could asymptomatic case, no? Unless getting tested pretty consistently. It‚Äôs CDC, aren‚Äôt following science? sub hilarious. slapped New York/California/Michigan title would praised.

But since it‚Äôs Texas/Monday/REPUBLICAN MAN BAD questioned. coming democratic leaning independent.

I guess people still waiting hidden piles body bags everywhere. someone wants call destroy mentally paradox freedom choice analogy

Cringe.  parents would sue whoever tried help since believe vaccine kill 3-5 years(don't even know got one from) don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs quite level. case numbers collapsing pretty quickly. seems like we‚Äôre point probably low enough risk people fine. 

If immonucompromised would rushing without mask hit Walmart? Probably not. risk trajectory probably low enough it‚Äôs major concern areas. common actual increased risk Blood Clots someone COVID? 28 COVID worried future blood clots. seems amount people lasting damage long-haul numbers far smaller reported one point. blood clots common reported? anything someone COVID alert clots now? Wonder Barnes Noble lift soon. mean, personally forget time, still nice wear it.

(Then last time CDC updated new guidelines PA's department following, might able now.) 100% vaccinated worry sure about. ones risk people vaccinated masked. They've made decision themselves. They'll still much safer people around vaccinated too. Safe enough now, still disregard herd immunity aspects vaccines.   point get COVID loved one gets dies suffers serious complications US, that's sorry ass loved ones too. plenty vaccines excuse get it. excuses kids 15, allergic vaccines, immunosuppressed people like cancer organ transplant people, home bound people. get anyone thinks good idea without us knowing new variants resist vaccines even enough people / children vaccinated... play safe? appease idiots? Still? still appealing dumbasses instead reality? something stopping that? 65% infections unvaccinated people one dose death rate low, according spanish cringe. teaching kid live fear ? airlines need keep masking place indefinitely reach 70-80% vaccinated/immunity, they‚Äôll drop mandate. Airlines clear this. Really solution since everyone packed together planes. He‚Äôs golem. make golem stop wiping mark forehead. ‚ÄúIt unlikely!‚Äù doesn‚Äôt console anybody whose child fact die flu COVID.  It‚Äôs suffocation risk. That's pretty major, I'm really sorry. I'd forge whatever signature get anyway. 

Other option: sue parents emancipation due willful negligence. Someone surely would take case pro-bono since would likely set precedence. go different state? California probably would let get it. friend who's LA got DC, check residency. No. Costco also dropped requirement. NY done good job following CDC guidance even seems little aggressive, vaccine eligibility start too, CDC recommended 65+ eligible nearly enough vaccine get all.

Thing is, NY guidance lot less aggressive vs states since many vaccinated. point get COVID loved one gets dies suffers serious complications US, that's sorry ass loved ones too. plenty vaccines excuse get it. excuses kids 15, allergic vaccines, immunosuppressed people like cancer organ transplant people, home bound people. increase please. funniest thing microchip vaccine us already carry device tracks movement listens say. I‚Äôve heard blood clots vaccine. explain relative risks? Literally can‚Äôt vaccine approved kids. said that. Funny get benefit positive externality portion population getting vaccine. idea situation is. comes mind refer negligence parents take zero precaution. ones taking kids parties believe covid threat whole situation government control. naysayers will. There's significant amount them.  cares many many million doses AMA begin 10 PDT (1 PM EDT). Please refrain answering questions guest. Thank you. mention pregnancies? expert communicable diseases? No? Okay then. better past year ""I'm *never* going wear mask selfish piece shit!""   think sub gives contrarian takes upvotes reasonable takes like downvotes. experience like first months COVID-19 front lines? Give holdouts time get vaccinated realize shit getting real, guess.

Nothing wrong ""Ya'll time get vaccinated, live"" approach either, though. someone fully vaccinated, beyond excited happy this! Absolutely. shone follow orders political wanks rather good public health policy. FDA approval imo far bigger impact vaccination rates CDC's announcement. people know got vaccinated, constantly bring ""lack full FDA approval."" would definitely help shutting ""it's rushed"" crowd understand emergency use authorization actually means. Costco drop yesterday? Oh, I'm sure he's favor abstinence-only education. I'd cool vaccine available everyone.  know venn diagram anti-maskers anti-vaxxers circle. fair children forced unsafe environments ""adults"" still act like children themselves. Well here‚Äôs ‚Äúsociety‚Äù telling risk fine want mitigate take precautions. Ok like variant doesn‚Äôt exist yet. variants around world show mutations vaccines work them. Covid‚Äôs playbook isn‚Äôt big it‚Äôs running options. There‚Äôs nothing anti-vaxxers, know I‚Äôm letting control life anymore. George W. Bush campaigned non-intervention foreign policy. George H.W. Bush got stage Republican National Convention said famous phrase, ""read lips: new taxes."" hard envision CDC receiving political pressure remove mask guidelines. 

I think political pressure behind guideline changes but, think ""but Biden promised"" compelling. I.....
*sips scotch slowly*,
 believe  IFR children age 0-17 20/1,000,000, 0.00002. exceedingly low lower risks children age face everyday. 

There 134 total deaths COVID children 14 under. need educate stop fear mongering. Thank participating Dr. Spyropoulos. I'm really fence vaccine. could get clot Covid-19 sounds like get clot vaccine. would recommendation others concerned? Thanks advance. asked doctor friend said CDC guidance correct based two facts confirmed based large population data:

1. effectiveness, vaccines proven even better dared hope (even 90% would enough end pandemic).

2. Due robust immune systems, risk kids 16 already significantly less risk fully post-vaccinated 30 year-old healthy adult. Kid's turbo-charged immune system naturally protects equivalent vaccine.

He claimed based official CDC data website. anyone confirm correct?

I'm fully vaccinated feel perfectly safe without mask due resistance feel like want keep 11 year-old home masked even though already resistance. crazy? Costco think, among others CDC estimating 33% population infected months ago  governor much power pandemic actions forced businesses shut down. 

Besides, governors representatives useful back modes travel communication lot limited. Nowadays cars, phones, Internet individual people ones power.  Maybe fact weren‚Äôt wearing pants.  Keep kids wearing masks staying home long want dude.

No one trying force stop wearing mask.

You hand saying saying society needs forced things according risk tolerance, selfish non-sensical. Unbelievable. There's also ""real possibility"" child contracting flu dealing lifelong consequences. all, flu vaccine hardly 50% effective. wear masks winter season. you? ""new normal"". Life goes realize PA changed exact thing last Thursday, day cdc announcement, right? CCP extremely powerful things could really damage exception system wide healthcare collapse time US EU fully reopened successful vaccination campaign. know large scale vaccination campaign best way avoid that.  mean cases burden health care system society general. higher level virus circulating makes herd immunity harder obtain 

If willing cases long vaccinated people protected, it. think I'll bringing mask planes forever, even necessarily wear it. 

When masks longer required planes trains future, I'm seated next coughing passenger, wanna wear mask. Prohibiting non religious fave coverings? miss this? Could givr an.example one places? Like, times wearing bandana motorbike illegal somehow? one wierd ""no selling white salmon thursdays bluth county"" kinda laws? capacity limits, social distancing requirements, curfews, etc. gone awhile ago. They're bigger negative impact economy masking requirements. businesses need anything prepare - told average restaurant owner we're going 50% 100% capacity tomorrow they'd ready tonight. certainly lot cases back too. vaccinated held hostage enforce mask compliance population resistant reason? Great, can‚Äôt take kids target now. one little joys (indoor) had... quick masked trip target toys. Yes, article says Spain one countries concern political experts. guys care freedoms 40 years dictatorship lol. someone smarter interpret this? sounds like us already degree natural immunity virus, don‚Äôt feel that‚Äôs right.  Got it. Listen CDC agree them. could tell instantly lacked perspective. mean, among good-sized studies I'm seeing numbers _around_ 80% 3-4 weeks, seem like they're exaggerating much me.

Like maybe saying ""80-90"" _technically_ true since that's possible within CIs. I'd say including 50% number comparable study actual 1-dose studies even exaggeration. I'm vaccinated still wearing mask kids, wait till fall/winter numbers go people indoors. hope I'm wrong though. clearly fine 600 000!!! mask mandate afford us protect forced **everyone** wear masks. Dropping mandate going clearly allow unvaccinated individuals go maskless put rest risk. perhaps isn‚Äôt CDC‚Äôs concern, surely someone aware benefit blanket protection unintended repercussions dropping it. That's shame. cut grass without one, massive headache rest day. sometimes keep mine drive windows rolled helps too. seriously believe anti vax crowd wore masks indoors? point last year half?

man, come live reality? This. Here‚Äôs thing, I‚Äôve read significant percentage kids long-COVID type symptoms. adults there‚Äôs blood clots heart problems sorts stuff. personally, don‚Äôt want bank kid *fine* long term. Especially since turned year old can‚Äôt wear mask. CDC guidance states unvaccinated people need continue wear masks. propose vaccinated drop theirs? okay failing carry cdc guidance?  Oh boy. comes fourth wave...  No, argument look policy macro level. I.e. most-important thing get people take vaccine. seem trying give big incentive get vaccinated.

That differ makes sense micro level. micro level, stuff like mask wearing make scientific sense local case levels sufficiently high vaccination levels sufficiently low.

Again, difference overall public policy what's best locally individually seen early guidance people wear masks health care workers nationally access PPE (which important keep health care system running). literally example CDC this. ‚ÄúTeam member‚Äù aisle koolaid in?  always hated kinda crap corporations  terrific giving 5 yo covid. long everyone else comfortable flex pie holes amirite. hear argument alot left. true, things life put others danger? Like driving instance? walking around common flu? acceptable, line drawn covid? 

And also agree fact United States premised individuals responsbile health, responsibility make sure somebody else stays healthy? Shouldnt make choice stay home/mask up/quarantine/social distance dont feel safe.

There literally millions people walking around (even pre covid) terrible immune systems. viruses diseases would kill us, could kill them. Pre covid never thought twice protect people (from sociatal standpoint), covid different?   That's great. Children wear mask get lives. I'm vaccinated, wearing mask.   Depends part country. area employees store, customers, tell GTFO mask up. Would prefer get closer herd immunity everyone starts throwing caution wind. even 50% vaccinated yet.

Ugh. ‚ÄúTop Texas Expert‚Äù  Surprise surprise. hospital chain operates states take pandemic seriously others sites protests Covid-related restrictions ""personal freedom"" mask mandates. Prioritizing population fine expected. Prioritizing 12 year olds helping risk groups places situation much worse not. wear mask get life? I'm vaccinated, wearing mask unless mandated business I'm in.

When believe life safe risks all? I‚Äôm sorry. It‚Äôs BS I‚Äôm high school librarian many kids position. is? link... actual study, rather talking head summarizing ""something""

Boggles mind year news organizations cannot bothered link studies cited. science ""evolves"" able link study changes perception.

[This appears helpful starting figure speech. article what‚Äôs important. Certainly few. Everything degree risk. Guessing avoid whiplash negative feelings regarding it. absolutely wearing mask probably next year. 

If fact I‚Äôve sick almost two fucking years 0_0 idiots referring CDC?   Got it.

So wearing mask 4 months shopping 20 minutes much you. That's need say  *eyeroll* think know real liar here. there‚Äôs harm waiting out, ever go back?

I think it‚Äôs accurate say harm waiting well worth cost going store weeks. I'm sorry hear that. Try stay safe time arrives. Right. believe masks help. clearly silver bullet, mask mandates prevent terrible outbreaks thousands deaths day. things started declining late winter/early spring, removal mask mandates states like Texas North Dakota result renewed spikes states. much appears factors mask wearing much greater impacts rise fall outbreaks. Didn‚Äôt say reviewing information (and likely figuring logistics)? That's probably best number since pandemic started US link would helpful recollection. one provides starting shortages material goods ‚Äúthe science‚Äù? Push ‚Äúthe science‚Äù let government worry material goods supply. Good answer! üëç 

Compassion fruit found gardens saying anyone fully vaccinated deserves get there's ample time get vaccine.

Actually, I'm saying CDC given clear go ahead without mask I'm people state eligible April 19th, get appointment 28th. get second shot late May fully vaccinated around mid June.

I'm glad they're getting vaccinated! great news line today's improved numbers vaccination rate. meantime, people continue wear mask take whatever precautions deem necessary ""waiting turn"" everyone doing, saying screw people, they're lazy, open everything up!

I said anything sort‚Äîjust wear mask anymore, anyone else who's vaccinated. hard may accept, actually good actually waited eligible instead lying chronic condition smoking past jump line like saw many people do. I'm sure inconvenience wear mask another 2 weeks get exposed anti vax, anti mask people.

Waiting sucks! I'm sorry that. hey, weeks, no? can, website says need parental consent age(they present, sign something)  Yes

You‚Äôll fine.  three months deaths cases low far imprortant metric many people got vaccinated. unvaccinated people going maskless grocery stores that's fine trade people motivated get vaccinated. Cases continue go every state vaccines amazing. Vaccinated people fine regardless unvaccinated people chose lie. 

You far safer walking Target today zero masks sight December. People need grasp concept vaccines way better masks. may true

Not ""may be"". true. true entire time understand people completely forgotten vaccinated offers similar protection wearing mask terms spreading others

This exactly problem though - _we studies prove yet_. anecdotal evidence supports it, nothing peer reviewed yet far I'm aware. That's following science, that's hedging bets hoping people get vaccinated.

In fact, data shows vaccinated individuals perfectly capable asymptomatically spreading covid overwhelming majority breakthrough infections asymptomatic. majority breakthrough cases know asymptomatic, effectively way knowing many breakthrough cases been, people go get tested they're vaccinated sick. still spread covid they're asymptomatic, therefore still wearing masks _because masks protecting people around you, yourself_. anyone know done studies see effect covid-19 vaccine blood people normally low platelet count? 
What tell us way (a) covid-19 sickness (b) moderna pfizer covid vaccine people normally low platelet counts? Honestly live every single person mask inside store. I‚Äôve going really haven‚Äôt seen someone giving someone else hard time wearing mask. think issue hand parents exposing children risk first place. mask mandates getting lifted reward done right thing, regards pandemic, gotten vaccinated. 

However, since stores seem like wanting assume liability checking vaccinations would entail, assumed percentage store-goers unvaccinated wearing masks. think solution that, vaccines going younger whatever is, diligent parent avoiding exposure children.  take kid store go double mask thank link sorry, would going doctor this? manage unsupervised trip CVS?  article says reviewing guidance mask rules continue make decision. guess make announcement next couple days NH administering doses residents mid April, total vaccines administered doesn‚Äôt necessarily reflect total NH residents vaccinated. People vaccinated longer vulnerable hence major issue others dont wear mask. 

For kids, COVID never big threat kids still wear mask help them. 

Also note cases deaths low right now, overall risk vulnerable populations extremely low now. Thank link No. moving next phase experiment. biggest issue would EASY roll back every single guidance, rule, suggestion one thing, they've made complicated lost nuance message. reads like premature ""Mission Accomplished"" again. 
 
They left ""Wear mask inside."" Get rid distancing, plexiglass screens, confusing messages wearing inside, outdoor masks, crowd restrictions, everything. one rule everyone still effective thing prevent virus outside getting vaccinated. 
 
I know hardcore individual liberty-ers throw fit masks, inconsequential action lives point could keep another 3 months potentially get rid COVID faster. maybe normal end year. 

Huzzah plane literally small, compressed tube air... No, solution would make everyone drive 10mph top speed bad drivers.

And technology stop covid called vaccines. good enough, got folks screaming ""not 100%"" ""Variants"". ""reckless"" ""uncaring"" fully vaxed people wanting ditch masks going along ""forever mask"" policy. entire article thread people *volunteering* wear masks reasons, making *you* wear one. people valid reasons still wearing mask, even COVID related. argument entirely misplaced fabricating victim complex.

Someone else wearing mask benefit zero affect life. True. Hopefully get soon. still reviewing new CDC guidance (so old mask rule holds now). haven‚Äôt really made decision yet I'm wearing mask die. America can't trusted enforce idiots.  vaccinated still paranoid encountering people unvaccinated, effectiveness vaccines welcome ""shut-in"" argument CDC proven completely trustable said wear masks early on? would trustable said wanted hear?

Because I‚Äôm medical expert epidemiologist. I‚Äôm wondering stop looking CDC guidance start looking people Reddit.  Yes, bars limited capacity due distancing standing (unless headed bathroom).

This meant could go places limited friends (agains due capacity) mingle. significantly less fun unrestricted environment.

Seems odd keep September Highly illegal deadly lot areas. feel uncomfortable store, go isn‚Äôt critical thinking it‚Äôs plain definition word lmao CDC remarkably stupid useless pandemic. done entire agency needs restructuring. hard difficult keep young child locked (have 4 year old...

I've seen people say would invasion privacy there's also places giving free food showing must ok ask.   cite corporate policy website What? No, can't, vaccination prevents severe disease. They've done best cards they've dealt. first year trying function inform administration everything power prevent public access information instead pressured tests approval (unsuccessfully) drugs come president's personal stock portfolio, like hydroxychloroquine. They've also waste time damage control bullshit, like putting statements people drinking bleach. imagine day life includes confounded tell people drinking bathing Lysol bad. Keep mind we've put child cabinet locks kitchen sink decades keep toddlers exact things. 

I'm certainly upset criticism finding undeserved, context everything. They've done fantastic job getting vaccines people want/need past several months trying rebuild agency gutted required lot top brass turnover. Even then, business fully capable handling business. I'm sure many would prefer restrictions lifted today. business = money. I‚Äôm CA too, I‚Äôm desperately hoping newsom speeds reopening process. Virtually every state eliminating restrictions within next 10 days we‚Äôre keeping another month. lowest case rates/highest vaccination rates. now, they've able way others protecting them.

Others still protecting getting vaccinated. type people taking advantage others right thing. Yeah wife well-controlled T1D became clear early biggest risk going infection-induced DKA, necessarily virus via respiratory issues. Luckily made without catching fully vaccinated. Lets see week two big one. OSHA backing let work places drop mask mandates. wife wears masks home kids? UK issues people blaming 5g burning multiple cell towers?

I know thing kind crazy. fact reason lift mandates protect everyone anyone might harmed lifting mandates. takes nothing people continue wearing masks cause irreparable harm young children.

The thing argument you‚Äôre getting ‚Äúwear mask forever‚Äù territory. always people can‚Äôt vaccinate unvaccinated people spreading virus, logic one car argue mask remain forever.

Target Chicago someone standing door every single day they've open pandemic.

They keep wearing masks want, leave kids home like they're supposed to. [Lasting immunity found recovery There's lot anti-Chinese sentiment Reddit West general.

This possibility unlikely. Again, pool shrinking quickly seen variants heavy worldwide spread. Small rural pockets unvaccinated likely cause one mRNA vaccines highly effective variants anyways.

The unfortunate outcome immunocompromised higher risk due unvaccinated wearing masks. That's CDC recommends talk doctor continuing wear mask. believe deaths said covid actually deaths caused covid?  literally enough time immunity free keep wearing masks, one cares people choosing wear masks. We're talking mandated mask wearing fully vaccinated people here. Give time think Costco still is, Krogers Source? Yep. continue call people make disingenuous arguments caring one themselves.

**Most importantly, say unvaccinated need wear masks**. propose ensure everyone drops masks? think that's over-simplistic scape-goating.

They're forced take ""alternate reality"" segment's word they're supposedly ""vaccinated"" they're un-masked, fact know they're not.

There's truth concerns, there's also realization we're reaching end stage pandemic US. Nearly health officials acknowledge regions approach 50%+ vaccinated chance surges (even variants) becomes smaller &amp; smaller. truth vaccinated acts like super N95 mask, preventing infection transmission. people get whine individual liberty, blah blah. lot people *can't* get vaccinated they're immunocompromised, etc, mention kids. Betty getting vaccinated might mean ends killing Sue *can't*. That's I'd zero problem vaccines becoming compulsory. posted without even linking facts information. data page 3 months date.

take look racial map us went local Lowe's Saturday signs down. kept mask walking garden center, started feel...distrustful...that folks seeing masks actually vaccinated (my area probably close 30% people refuse vaccinate) decided put back went building. thought gonna totally ready, I'm realizing going take awhile get there.

The safest thing would walk everywhere, feet get tired like listening radio drive, worth risk me. difficulty covid still affects working-class Hispanics, many vaccine-hesitant huge variety reasons (immigration status, skeptical Western medicine, limited after-work hours vax clinics, ""machismo"", etc). cases non-existent upscale areas like Palo Alto Santa Monica there's still outbreaks industrial towns &amp; agricultural communities.   ... People forget even fully vaccinated still catch covid..., aim eliminate keep alive wearing masks. Also 270mil doses vac given means 135mil people fully vaccinated still 200mil+ people fully vaccinated yet. 

There harm wearing mask... Kids still get covid... sickly elderly get it, risk getting killed getting vac... That's different issue, helping OP figure know rules specific Target.  Mind business.   employer made masks mandatory (this office setting). Two people, still unvaccinated obviously, wore week never again. people generally wore but, pretty careless (taking off, letting fall off, etc). can't imagine *that* much different elsewhere.

If kids, I'd probably start extra cautious them. But, think new guidelines change actual risk much.  Saying non-vaccinated customers must wear mask essentially means mask mandate. People lie vaccine status. Really, man? You‚Äôre aware people families support we‚Äôre middle crushing economic circumstances right? No, many, many people choice whether work not. fact, lot people choice exposed taken away forced work ‚Äúessential‚Äù workers. COVID deserves attention it‚Äôs killed millions fucking people, man. We‚Äôre supposed let new diseases take people state load? You‚Äôre trying find kind rationalization care. Bear Grylls currently conducting research topic. still enough people vulnerable COVID-19 overwhelm health care system.

Well, actually, agree that. Given levels immunity there, think there's capacity surge comes close overwhelming hospitals. Well, maybe southern states lowest vaccination percentages. hand, still lot deaths happening.

We're transitional period, two things true: unlikely full-on surge, still early completely throw caution winds. thing science, especially novel virus, evolves time. know everything.

I think risk low, never said didn't. also think wearing mask 4 months little burden worth it. That's it

Your imagination running wild, take fucking meds. yes, disagree CDC's decision. made encourage people get vaccinated, obviously that's going work. Sorry, nationalized health plan fix poverty afford shitty, non-nutritious food, don‚Äôt access exercise programs / facilities. decide smoke drink much. mean, could keep trying force large % population wear masks, despite vaccines lower spread; end result people jumping vote republicans mid-terms. mask wearing something selfish people furious about. Eh disagree. I‚Äôm walk stranger wearing mask reasons. One probably would find offensive want maintain public distance. two can‚Äôt tell emotions are. See real doctor Covid would likely preventable risk adults eligible get vaccine did. You‚Äôre arguing semantics. can‚Äôt understand people care fear kids instead dick it. vaccine hasn‚Äôt seen multiple years clinical trials

I think agree 90%, yet tossing antivaxx talking point really makes sad. reasons valid concern.

Do think unreasonable force, example, green card recipients get certain vaccines coming work USA? think unreasonable schools require vaccinations students enter? (It's established constitutional law are). Health care workers required vaccinations many kinds order jobs. unacceptable violation civil liberties? State Department require vaccinations travel variety different countries. None stuff new controversial anyone handful Jehovah's witnesses, now. now.

Why situation different? feel like even reasonable, intelligent people like idea acceptable protection public health moved far towards unprecedentedly extremist position kind mind-boggling.

Here's background common sense issue current propaganda wave made insane seem normal normal seem do, can. That's violating hell even there's nothing hide. kinda flag waving bullshit I‚Äôm fully vaccinated don‚Äôt want walk around indoors ppl thinking I‚Äôm anti-vax douchebag. Yes Well they're probably nice, responsible people lot stores told employees confront people masks sometimes they‚Äôd shoot employees confronting Plenty immunocompromised people cannot get vaccines. realize right?  must new... adults cannot get vaccinated.  Target morning, people still wearing masks. pretty hard eat drink mask on. recommend it. never science California.

It power. I'm surprised small grocery store mid Michigan town still requiring them, given many local stores enforced signs. I'm guessing employee relative owners got virus either died came close it. Sad wake call needed. even accommodations, help immunocompromised get back normal. want travel, want office I'm going able foreseeable future. Maybe ever? knows whole unmasking thing seems rushed IMO. feel punitive ask people wear masks Indoors Public higher vaccinations lower cases, ever comes first. Getting N95s use daily cost prohibitive. America vaccines also effective India strain. know pandemic even there's enough people getting least one vaccine (which also 75-80% effeciacy).

Also 95% number comparing group vacinated individuals group unvaccinated, comparing ratio many group catch COVID. mean 95% protection 5% vaccinated group risk catching it, 100% population catch COVID once. risk vaccinated individuals incredibly low even areas still struggling virus US.

No let guard down, doubt strain India going ravage US definitely going cause ""large number hospitalizations deaths vaccinated"". Hopefully will. fun!!! I'm gonna wait two weeks family 2 weeks 2nd dose start unmasking public places. sick single time since started wearing mask, pretty big fan tbh. Maybe live Anyone 16 get vaccine want.

At point, can't get one choice. Okay many adults die? long term effects Covid infection? Things like heart, lung, brain damage?

We‚Äôre fine ditch masks months early?  write statistical occurrence base everything feelings point? help achieve herd immunity getting COVID. Nothing going change anyway. I'm done waiting pull heads asses. now.   vaccinated. usually wear one outside (when street). lazy. put mask house grab keys forget it. drive wear parking lot store. take off, honestly bothers take get damn ear strap untangled hair leave go shopping.  Older dude know works Target medically ineligible vaccine. Wonder he'll quit fired refusing work unmasked public coming face. saying glad work Walmart too. Ouch. No, that‚Äôs true really shouldn‚Äôt spread false information may make people less cautious.

Pfizer right website. depends definition severe case is, CDC definition pretty strict takes really worst cases account. FDA definition somewhat loose, efficacy 100% - loose doesn‚Äôt mean FDA counts cold severe case, still severely ill prolonged FDA definition. Definitely nothing would want experience. Okay said though affect people‚Äôs health, ways far reaching whether get virus.

What eat direct impact people‚Äôs health planet‚Äôs health, presently generations come. Literally eat affects another person‚Äôs health care see scope things.

If government mandate eat behave ways lead contamination food water supplies therefore harm others (to give one example), no, vaccines mandated either far guise one‚Äôs choice affecting others. Excellent answer. told you! Enjoy even himself.  No, answered question. wanted different answer worded question better. you. Commufornia like 1% positivity rate. 

Waiting June 15 nuts.

Live free, Californians! Public restrooms. almost never seen one good ventilation. saw lot people thought fine take masks there. ""It's okay take mask eat drink"" likely killed way store killed Coronavirus. iirc PA doing. don‚Äôt know that‚Äôs still way Wolf set CDC said masks vaccinated.  That‚Äôs roughly populations New York, LA, Chicago combined  you‚Äôre vaccinated, don‚Äôt need wear mask inside.

Depending levels spread around even things like crowded is. Lol mate I‚Äôm ‚ÄòCDC worshipper‚Äô. think rule go maskless you‚Äôve got vax, make sure without vax wear mask, even petty reasons like giving new reason get one. I‚Äôm aware lots people lie it, even one four people get vaccine it, that‚Äôs results.

I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worth speculating new variant yet. Early studies show positive results vaccines, anyway, breakthroughs. doesn‚Äôt mean breakthroughs fatal anything mild case. Let‚Äôs leave speculation aside clear data. can't say understand. might good thing repost form question /r/COVID19. clear projection based fact still bunch unvaccinated people, somehow projecting catastrophic break immunity? language bit head. see absolutely nothing, anywhere, including r/COVID19 suggests significant escape immunity. needs science pick random date future. doubt change week week. slow process re-adjustment. imagine said offices open. Go back work! doubt 1/4 firms would return full in-person staffing first months.   60% adults received least one dose, although second dose Moderna Pfizer highly recommended, one shot provides lot immunity. studies shown 80% protection first shot. that's 3 5 adults least somewhat inoculated. 

It's believed 10-15% adults unvaccinated, protection antibodies prior infection. include that, 70-75% adults kind protection COVID. 

As kids, sad seem basically moving without vaccinated? Yes, *extremely* rare young child hospitalized COVID even rarer child die it. CDC's website shows flu dangerous little kids. 

It's unlikely we're going see spike hospitalizations, especially considering 5% cases result hospitalization, mostly people 65+. 85% age 65+ population received least one dose. wonder going play starting week. March now, retailers voluntarily maintained mask requirements. However, major retailers like Costco, Walmart Target lifted company-wide requirements allowing vaccinated people go maskless.

With last hurdle taken down, unvaccinated, ""I condition"" people finally able walk around maskless. Several states already dropped mask mandates. see predicted renewed spikes areas, I'm sure people confident we're see everywhere else. get 2 examples kill less people covid per year, still havent explained covid deserves attn dont. line drawn? many deaths per year?

Also nobody forcing work companh makes work office. gonna say thats choice, driving also choice. Looks like ur comparing equivalent arguments. Leave home. can't leave hone shop online. There's reason risk life child go target. think risk nothing changed you. Correct. 

It's going work. reason unreasonable people. morons still get vaccinated unless force to. soon events locations start enforcing rules making people show vaccination card. introduce fakes. Agreed. start offering supplies AZ vaccine people already received first shot, start increasing population fully vaccinated people. One step getting Canada reopened. Huh. 

That‚Äôs ballpark flu. that‚Äôs number kids die hospitalized flu. Oh okay, care others then. people want vaccinated can't due medical conditions? said get hella sick. person responding said no, can't get hella sick vaccine prevents severe disease.

I think obvious person talking talking thing talking about. real numbers sure, unvaccinated are, point, overwhelmingly young.

Take home state Wisconsin. 45% total population vaccinated (57% adults), number jumps 75% 55 older. age group makes 75% deaths overwhelming majority ICU stays. 

So yes, infections amongst vaccinated, vast majority asymptomatic therefore unlikely tested.

I suspect why, nationwide US, seen cases drop precipitously. I'm American mate. rest world vaccinated exactly vaccine resistant variant occur there. selective pressure occur large vaccinated population herd immunity mingling unrestricted other. exactly US now. 13 year old sister. parents want wait get J&amp;J ""traditional"" even though keep telling get pfizer ASAP.

My main point johnson johnson isnt even approved 16-18 yet, it'll months she'll starting school (with vaccine required) approved anyway  feel soon based everything reading point re: need positivity rates vaccination levels. 

I don‚Äôt know, feels weird. still working home vaccinated. won‚Äôt wearing mask anymore unless required I‚Äôm business employees still wear (feels bad wear one employees still required). feel like bystander since I‚Äôm really strongly affected either way. anxiously watching see happens next months. pandemic over, even US. social cost, sure, eat 50 burgers day, nobody else health issues I'm trying say analogous second-hand smoke. bad personal choice health, also affects health people sign effects.

You realize Poland public healthcare?

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  Humans bad risk assessors general, even amazing given much data suggest safe take vaccine. Even J&amp;Js blood clotting correlating rate right still low. Right, logical thing bring sad deflection?

It feels like aren‚Äôt great, one straight malicious actions. 

Feels like deflection honestly.  trust mother Centers Disease Control matter Disease Control, literally logic used antivaxxers  Interestingly studies shown evangelicals likely unvaccinated. Wonder many going ignore rules Bible prohibit lying. Pretty sure religion doesn‚Äôt allow lie vaccine don‚Äôt like rules masks. Regardless, bet lot going lie. Onee would many preventable. hear right now, acceptable loss area life? people high risk group needs protecting. think ""wait, hell?"" get ""when X number hits Y, lift mask requirements"" instead got ""hey, we're done, clear"" random Friday afternoon.

I following closely lot maybe happened missed it, simpletons POV, less alarming ""well escalated quickly"". Thinking/hoping entirely lifted sooner that‚Äîif PA citizens vote Yes ballot's first two questions tomorrow could limit governor's power mask mandates could officially gone entirely days, Memorial Day capacity restrictions gone. Paranoid much? Stop living fear binged channel much beginning Id rather inject stuff body MAY work. never know strain flu widespread take educated guess. covid vaccine different exactly covid is, much flu virus changes every year seem guidance parents living unvaccinated children. fully vaccinated, clear information, still wearing one keep kids protected can.  % children get covid also get long term affect? got vaccination card laminated. Im going get copy shrunk keep card wallet. 

I'm definitely ready flex vaccination world go bare-faced wilds. could give less shit random strangers supermarket think me. usually shop headphones I'm generally focused finding items leaving doubt would even notice weird looks. seconds amount second hand smoke inhale minuscule, unlikely cause respiratory problems. Cant say someone happens virus.

And need understand respiratory disease smoking inhaling secondhand smoke due constant exposure. don‚Äôt need constant exposure corona virus get it, one encounter enough. *Should* yes, epidemiologicaly, actual behavior counts. rate may high nationally, live somewhere red, diverge greatly average. several elderly family members vaccinated (one day away son convinced cancel), one died days Christmas certain virus even real.

I'm greatful numbers getting better lot places, there's still lot work many places. CDC actively hurting things. Oh know. worked lab studied infectious diseases years. enough info available calm. safe there,. Hi John. How's going work today? Got juicy update us regarding Covid vaccinations work?   consistent, CDC wrong start saying wear mask. said dumb dumb now. wanted add 600 epidemiologists asked think drop masks vast majority said 6 months end year.

So sub CDC disciples trusting science want hear. half science says keep little bit longer. üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ  Since I'm immunosuppresants allowed initial clinical trials, I'll waiting get data efficacy us take meds suppess immune systems. I'd also like wait least adults (and preferably 12 up) chance get fully vaccinated. long ago states opened vaccination adults! Soviet Russia vaccines get you! plenty Mondays past year. reported covid deaths Texas. there‚Äôs hypocrisy you‚Äôre saying? left go full blind trust CDC Fauci year say don‚Äôt know they‚Äôre talking about?? [The lab, seconds photo CDC says variant page epidemiologists view breakthrough mutations singificant risk. think CDC/DOT still requires masks flying, airlines. Give time. weeks word get around, management figure new policies, signs taken down, etc. could always try go maskless anyone says anything could kindly put mask courtesy. get voted, vaccine Russian known less efficient western counterparts vaccine comes emergency authorization gets full approval, see insurance companies pushing employers make vaccines mandatory employees. Healthcare costs high insurance companies statistics money. won‚Äôt want cover bunch walking liabilities. course not, everyone make pools safer.

All I‚Äôm saying think mask regulations stay place EVERYONE vaccinated, including children. It‚Äôs matter months. every parent ability keep kid safe. takes afew seconds guy behind take cigarette start smoking move away Less dangerous? CDC said look research supporting masks. go read conclusion least highly questionable.

The sources citations, go read primary literature. happening every sub right now--people straight downvoting comments go extreme fear taking masks post vax I'm surprised cdc announce vaccine became available kids. really shame. asking previous commenter sarcastically since originally disagreeing new mask mandate restrictions loosening. good data ty. sure trying sarcastic actually curious. obviously wear home asleep. there's something face day come home without it, switch upset OCD. Resisting urge day, I'm trying relax OCD makes feel like able relaxing wanted day. straight annoying. OP, would think 0-deaths Monday long streak Mondays deaths still good thing. Maybe huge deal, still good thing, least counties consistently reporting Sunday numbers sooner others.  Here's thing: US alone, less half population fully vaccinated.

In order reduce transmission, one-two punch masks vaccines unquestionably necessary; simply work, anyone denies simply paying attention.

Every time someone infected, - - result mutations virus replicates within host. mutations spread, easily become new dominant strains.

By revoking mask requirements less half population vaccinated, ultimately result new variant strains. run risk vaccine effective new strains every time new one becomes prevalent. words, revoking mask requirements stage game could result rendering current vaccines circulation varying degrees useless.

It's simply soon, encourage people holding *continue* holding complete lack repercussions.  Masks gone NY Wednesday. Following CDC guidelines makes sense. Punishing vaccinated people order get unvaccinated deranged. put severe restrictions Chinese(or Taiwanese returning mainland China) entire time, Europeans Americans never get treatment even COVID raging, unlike U.S. banned Europeans eruption cases. later said masks protect social cost, sure, eat 50 burgers day, nobody else health issues result.

What I'm trying say analogous second-hand smoke. bad personal choice health, _also_ affects _the health of_ people sign effects. I‚Äôll save reply. None people ‚Äúacceptable risk‚Äù doctors. I‚Äôm tired reading tired old phrase ‚Äúbelieve science‚Äù. don‚Äôt believe shit. It‚Äôs faith, it‚Äôs data. LITERALLY read studies confirm whether vaccines significantly decrease infections not. It‚Äôs right there, it‚Äôs one study either. consensus anybody who‚Äôs trying keep literature known weeks, months now.  it? mask say sunglasses covering eyes, good facial recognition standpoint. Variants don‚Äôt stay start. 

Variants travel world even know exist times.  true. 3 roommates getting vaccines this. I‚Äôve fully vaccinated month now. trust him? privileged take. Something tells you‚Äôre minimum wage employee work public, healthcare worker worst year life, parent suddenly found homeschooling bored, depressed kids trying work full-time home well. 

Covid exposed intense class culture divides America. One part country lounging home pajamas saying ‚Äúyeah great, didn‚Äôt years ago!‚Äù Meanwhile half putting lives mental health line every day feels like they‚Äôre fucking dying. VOV.VN - nation recorded total 181 new community cases novel coronavirus (COVID-19), majority made F1 contacts quarantine facilities previously met confirmed COVID-19 patients, according Ministry Health (MoH) May 17. 
 
Among latest cases local transmission recorded May 17 afternoon seven provinces, 61 reported Bac Giang , Bac Ninh (38), Da Nang (7), Hanoi (5), Phu Tho (2), Hung Yen (2), Vinh Phuc (1). 
 
In addition, Khanh Hoa province also confirmed one imported case Japan day. 
 
The latest cases therefore raise national tally 4,359. total 1,320 cases recorded since fourth COVID-19 wave hit country April 27. 
 
The MoH‚Äôs Medical Examination Administration reported among active patients currently receiving treatment, many 100 since tested negative COVID-19 least once, many recording several negative tests. 
 
Among total figure, 2,668 patients since declared clear virus, fatality count relating COVID-19 stands 37. 
 
Meanwhile, Central Hospital Tropical Diseases Hanoi said that, 7:00 a.m. May 17, hospital treating 344 COVID-19 patients. includes 52 critically-ill patients, majority relying mechanical ventilation, one requiring EXMO (Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation), four others suffering continuous hemodialysis. 
 
Furthermore, remaining patients temporary stable clinical para-clinical indexes continuing receive treatment. would expect parents kids offered vaccine prevent one death. can‚Äôt speak parents, I‚Äôd definitely take it. 

That‚Äôs literally I‚Äôm saying. Keep masks *everyone* vaccinated, including kids.  Fuck'em. 













Wait nvm, that. bad guidance, stores comply dollar, dollar says remove mask requirements. Capitolism shortsighted, antivaxxers stupid assholes. person previously stated child young wear mask. Per CDC recommendations, children 2 can‚Äôt wear masks. 

You say ‚Äúdon‚Äôt take store‚Äù that‚Äôs practical plenty people, primarily single parents. there‚Äôs plenty US. interesting see happens second shot percentage going forward. hypothesize drop. people delayed vaccination they‚Äôre afraid side effects, usually worse second dose. 

I hope doesn‚Äôt drop much.  would fine lying.

Full disclosure, I'm vaccinated yet I'm still weighing pros cons, continue wear mask distance courtesy others. choice. everyone's choice.

No one right tell us wear mask, to, regardless vaccinated status. worried, get vaccine, stay home, leave time someone takes mask off.

Basically, life scary. WANT live fear, thats you. insist others same. Back 2011, fly pretty bad cold -- 8-hour flight felt bad person sitting next put mask on. guy really appreciated that. No, *this* bad take. person you‚Äôre harming eating shitty diet yourself. getting vaccinated, you‚Äôre putting society risk well got attention thriving community built 30 years. Maybe people return Italy covid control businesses won‚Äôt face repeated Miaomiao, journalist Zhejiang lives Prato, estimated 2,500 people, 10% Chinese community, gone back China last year. Marco Wong, another town councillor, said figure ""realistic"". zero evidence variants immune vaccine. Except vaccinated people pass onto kids young vaccine. 

I exposed variant asshole lied vaccinated. never developed symptoms vaccine protected kid got sick hospital week lung damage. think backyard swimming pools banned? Remember, conversation choices make, choices want force others make. equate wearing mask suffering...

I'm surprised anyone issues wearing mask worried virus. struggling much, clearly health issues. know live, Target enforced them, personally witnessed couple people made leave wearing one, suspect regional issue (my Target middle downtown Chicago, still requiring masks). article six weeks old. Yeah same. dont know enough variants yet seems crazy mask mandates lifted. live US state people cities believe covid real soon leave go rural communities surrounded anti vaxxer covid deniers. dont care Government says I'm still masking fully vaxxed person. Finally omfg disagree point, bit different personal choice affect lives health others - exactly something 100% personal like eating good diet.

Having unhealthy diet tends huge social cost... sick anti maskers Covid deniers coming around bold. 

Here's things get weird. 

I'm life long liberal Democrat. raging fights family hygiene theater taking threat seriously (they got sick, never did). 

I got legit jabbed twice. I'm clear 6 days I'm going burn fucking masks. I've done part protect others, done. 

But I'm standard issue middle aged white guy, folks going assume I'm anti-mask Covid denier, know fucking care anymore. family warn masks day 1 indoors public. first required made us feel safer. July became something meet mandate rules jerk. look around wearing masks, would say likely 20% wearing properly fitted properly. least pretense safety gone. ‚ÄúMost covid deaths Britain resulted covid caught Britain‚Äù lol cmon son, that‚Äôs viruses work. That‚Äôs pretty much proof variants scaremongering BS. variants concern deaths UK would SA variant Here's great article talking exactly describing. 

You're absolutely right. messaging bungled early intentionally structured allow people shame outdoor gatherings. Remember summer beach photos saw headlines calling irresponsible behavior possible? shaming people public parks? closed parks bike paths, running paths hiking trails. stupid. face public health info. Countries like Japan emphasized indoor spaces risk. kept charade ""any public gathering indoor outdoor risk"" way long. Even *now,* months developed distributed first vaccines, still people pull mask they're walking past wide street. hardwired us transmission outdoors still legitimate path true. Dry California Hawaii New Jersey ones left spoke children‚Äôs pediatrician regarding concern. pediatrician concerned all. said benefits outweigh risks. recommend speak children‚Äôs pediatrician well.

We planning careful daughter. taken big stores since March 2020. continue vaccinated.

My state still mask mandate, relaxing bit goes away. taken places last weeks. We're also planning short trip weekend. back normal her. Why? 100% agree. even took away mask mandates CA tomorrow, I'm confident majority people would continue wear stores point people cleared get vaccine  kind source claim, stating opinion? I'm sure I've seen anything CDC similar suggesting children ""don't need"" COVID vaccine. infant ready go back normal, pre-pandemic activities reason, least child in-tow. Wait benefits getting covid weigh risks not? Don‚Äôt think understand said. Gonna get second soon recent estimates place \~35% population vaccinated. seemed like months end CDC health officials warned herd immunity would require 70+% population vaccinated. complete simpleton health matters, hopeful outcome? Seems like surge new COVID hospitalizations incoming, millions people either willingly (or cases) vaccinated. decision seem bit premature? Note word ‚Äúguidance‚Äù... also guidance months wearing masks fuck ton people didn‚Äôt listen it. thing least people‚Äôs actions aren‚Äôt going kill people, yet people like show make seem like writing bad thing. What's good argument (now anti-science) people want keep wearing masks outdoors even they're vaccinated reasoning ""it could create variants vaccines can't protect us from""? others get vaccinated, danger children literally zero risk COVID, flu kills children COVID see mandatory flu vaccination kids can't get vaccinated. suddenly nobody wearing mask, can't take places one felt comfortable everyone masked. pandemic do, CDC specifically said vaccinated wear masks, kids (and wife almost always minus school/work).  I'm pretty dang red state we're 85+% 65+ I'm math'ing right. 

I add obviously completely rational personal behavior different parents/grandparents vaccinated (and envy balance health children's socialization development). I'm sure societally much restricting mandating things children protect elderly refused by-far-most-helpful protection. people absolutely right children nothing worry about. ‚ÄúWatch out‚Äù interesting prefix good advice need educate Vitamin essential. Calling bullshit Let's suppose correct- intentions good. makes move worse, better.

When Fauci lied masks beginning good intention saving PPE people medical community, eroded trust. played science based, political. CDC says 100% based science, positing political. result would erosion trust. Nobody wants indefinite mask mandates. Stop paranoid living fear  hearing. Yes know fact true heard people still getting sick badly. think seen study indicate either way anything please let know. make sound like wearing mask hard task youre virtuous person ever it. hard. probably easiest part entire pandemic hope mask wearing becomes heavily normalized out.

Bc guess what, countries norm pandemic tend spread disease much know ""95"" N95 stands for? Yes. autoimmune disease they're allergic several things. issue direct link allergen shot, autoimmune disorder always predictable. need justification restricting citizens businesses. there‚Äôs justification open NOW. There's loose relationship mask mandates people actually wearing masks. Austin, virtually every store still requires them. wearing masks apparently much trouble. single day entire pandemic children anything serious worry about. kids put danger driven school daily Cv ever them. Same. always feel like get sick flying around holidays. many sick people ""have to"" travel. bother risk protests backlash make de facto mandatory required numerous things? Want buy plane ticket? Need vaccinated. Want stay hotel? Need vaccinated. Want visit public event sport event concert? Need vaccinated. Want cross border? Need vaccinated. Since that's something right generally privately organized requirements put place. Point anyone said (that isn‚Äôt fear mongering faux entertainment) Children \*vaccinated\* flu higher risk flu COVID? that's true, cool. think worry among parents (like me). kid gets vaccinated flu every year, obviously changes risk profile. much? seen research. totally agree, mean I'm sure feel compulsory vaccinations, precedence legally requiring people adhere public health rules. many places legally required wear seatbelt drive, wear helmet ride bike motorcycle. Hell drunk driving laws public health effort made prevent accidents, imagine one could argue parallel drunk driving laws mandatory vaccinations. anti covid Vax parents let get covid vaccine. guess time come they've stepped moderation something?

I can't get original comment says trolling discussion thread (and not)

Or certain words automatically trigger it? info, check out: That's immensely un-scientific view issue. far, far greater chance mutations occurring uncontrolled spread la USA December India now. Also, clamoring variants STILL amounted much literally 4 months daily panic press wow. 

So took time read timeline, going step away.

As fond saying: ""Also get life.""

Adios!  thing radio personalities. article, sanctions, plan discriminate unvaccinated visiting pool etc Since I‚Äôm vaccinated, doesn‚Äôt matter. I‚Äôm sure help J&amp;J vax isn‚Äôt really traditional. Adenovirus vaccines still new. It‚Äôs like flu measles vaccine wherever thinking traditional. know people dont drink likely die thirst do? Mind BLOWN. think need references here. 

Is 99.6% actually efficacy infection, disease? Op saying symptomatic infection, I'm sure numbers matching metric stated. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm arguing wear masks day die. I‚Äôm arguing it‚Äôs premature remove mask mandates everyone eligible vaccinated want it. It‚Äôs one thing unvaccinated people put risk choose to; it‚Äôs another thing entirely put children risk parents don‚Äôt option protect them. Less risk isn‚Äôt risk, fact unknown long term effects repeated again. I‚Äôm vaccinated, unvaccinated absolutely going lie don‚Äôt wear mask.

Most people can‚Äôt get vaccinated (allergies, children, etc) wear masks protect themselves. babies can‚Äôt. Sucks parent take baby public indoor space, particularly single parents don‚Äôt choice bringing little one store. know ton assholes lie vaccinated avoid wearing masks. means cases continue spread longer happens, higher probability variants appear. next variant might handled current vaccines.

I want us get with, path see end COVID reducing spread cases knock completely many countries did.  entirely depends. outside crowd people, physically distanced? think everyone needs look motivate selfish get vaccinated

Give em free beer bratwurst 15 minute monitoring period, $50 check way second one, still probably save money vs health care long run. correct. outbreak, epidemic anywhere (and therefore certainly pandemic). SARS-1 (as far currently know) SARS-2 spillovers existing animal populations, they've species since they've us. key difference many, many, many human cases coronavirus previous one, lockdown global intense order work. *If* perfect observation lockdown moment knew going serious problem, could eliminated pathogen humans. commit enough lockdowns likely remain endemic humans indefinitely.  mean it‚Äôs two weeks. big deal. Beats august Good. move makes sense. think right way state government respond changing CDC guidelines. Give people, businesses, schools etc. time prepare changing guidelines change end day Friday say ""Good luck next week"". appreciate vaccines work, work well, changing people's behavior takes time giving heads goes long way making transition smoother.  cousin talked allergist? Unless there's specific component vaccine they're allergic to, issue. point being?

They're listing people can't get vaccinated unnecessarily digging category. like saying, ""You're allowed cat, dog, *or poodle*."" last item necessary since already said ""dog"". HEPA filters expensive - think best solution open windows possible ceiling fans moving air around. want use filter though - would help lot viruses what‚Äôs point waiting 12 days though Follow science, listen CDC Yes. exactly waiting for. Especially it‚Äôs going around SEPTEMBER vaccinate them. People ditching masks horribly premature. People work retail need masks. environment would definitely inconvenient ""suffering""?

Most people complaining experience retail people put go store 10 minutes. normal get sick. Folk saying they'll keep masking forever real hard time inevitably get sick. Immune system able handle it.  mean, think CDC throwing website speculation? I'm confused CDC stating something (and recent update!) = ""we know definitely yet""?   i‚Äôm applying every permanent remote role find avoid lol.  mixed decision. seeing absolute lack social responsibility antimaskers doubt much change. might new normal. People lie still die rate. says hundred kids work there, little different antivaxxers trusting random youtube conspiracy video. multiple vaccines. effective others.

Sinovac tested Brazilian town send new infections Im boat... cant wait vaccine approved 5 8 year olds Yup, that's good news! means stick, can't get it, worry refuse others like themselves. Hopefully former slowly shrink, still positive note. Yes were. Stores actually enforcing it. least state. Unfortunately I‚Äôd need genetic therapy achieve cardiorespiratory fitness. 

More exercise wouldn‚Äôt help - much makes heart damage muscle damage worse. 

And I‚Äôm super rare case - lot people genes stacked them. People catching nuances here. *definitely* you. 

Infections equal disease.

SARS-COV-2 virus. Covid-19 disease.

Just like HIV virus AIDS disease.

With SARS-CoV-2 you, probably least cells get infected, infection, technically. enough cells get infected immune system mounts enough response, may symptoms symptoms disease. enough infection, still infection, disease.

So Breakthrough infection infection (asymptomatic), may cause disease (symptoms).  Sounds like problem cdc still recommends children staff schools wear masks. you‚Äôre asking about? understand. see would hard you. one human another, hope give though. must way. idea medical system works are, I'm US, general rather uninformed comes countries. Stay safe can, hope agency find advise you. I'm sorry going this. People get phobias purpose fault. Okay, it‚Äôs choice get flu vaccine. choose get flu vaccine me, child old enough fall. don‚Äôt choice get vaccinated Covid all.  obviously whatever wants. that's takes feel safe, it.

That said, know anyone look statement think, ""Yep. That's mentally healthy individual."" say make fun him. feel *bad* him. PA. Everyone masked this. mask guidelines asking about? agree 100%.

I absolutely sympathize desire get good news FAST, give people added incentive get vaccinated soon.

But could least said ""we'll confirm 2 weeks"" given people time prepare. last which, private businesses (restaurants, stores etc.) scrambling figure whether keep asking customers mask not.

Also, coordinate better state governors pity's sake. Again, give people bit lead time.

Wondering hell charge PR communications CDC. Target employee concern well. People already lie face vaccinated medical condition preventing mask-wearing (and know lie hateful nasty it, genuinely cannot wear mask always politely disclose right away). enough people actually vaccinated start now, feel safe stop wearing mask work. matter, one-dose mRNA trials going on, too? anyone link data trend showing amount people getting vaccinated day? Surely we‚Äôve peaked already, number people getting vaccinated begun decrease. think stat may influenced CDC make call did. B.117 prevalent strain country currently, seen increase Covid deaths children. fact, numbers going down. Stop spreading Swing miss...I'm Houston.

You help yourself, image shows Rt going March 9th...

I checked Austin, Rt started going March 2nd, come back level March 2nd since then. one multiple days early April. (UT data)

Rt, source, entire state 0.95 March 27 April 17th.

Meanwhile, March 9th 0.81, lowest since July year before.

So thoughts caused uptick I've referring entire time presented data linked?

You quibble Rt like, clearly shows uptick across state time frame I'm talking about. major cities show thing. lot tracking sites even bother Rt anymore considered obsolete next tracking methods. 

You note Waco 1 early April time frame well... April, Public Health results large study COVID-19 transmission involving 365,000 households mix vaccinated unvaccinated found immunisation either Pfizer AstraZeneca vaccine reduced chance onward virus transmission 40-60%. means someone became infected vaccinated, around¬†half likely¬†to pass infection others compared infected people weren‚Äôt airtight definitely significant effect. note that's rare case actually get infected post vaccine. office going long planned renovation. Two years ago asked plans included windows could opened. COURSE NOT. still plans. feel like goalposts moved ""think kids"" move future. people going cling isolation masks forever. that's fine. I'm vaccinated done it. Realistically, risk sorts things addition Covid19. problem using safety immunocompromised individuals bar public health policy natural endpoint. Let's say everyone gets covid-19 vaccine; still risk flu, adenoviruses, aspergillosis, on, contagious dangerous you. 

It rational shape society around people challenges covid-19 specific. would true hospital systems able support capacity health issues... isn‚Äôt generally case. Someone getting surgery heart disease doesn‚Äôt deny anyone else bed medical care  Seconded Californian. first people rip masks anti-vaxxers lie say they've vaccinated

Can confirm. I'm Texas weekend masks almost nonexistent. Latest data saw 41% state least first shot. least half people lying.

State required masks awhile people still wore businesses required them. changed CDC said vaccinated people need wear them. Walmart, actually instructions distributed management enforce mask rule. instructions essentially boiled to, offer mask, say pretty please twice, and, still put mask, let shop anyways. individual stores may stricter enforcement, think fair say Walmart never enforced when, corporate level, rule enforce it. OSHA updated today putting CDC recs compliance requirements. Honestly think getting employers enforce masks unvaccinated employees intent easing restrictions condition vaxx status. Unlike shoppers store, employers enforce matter OSHA compliance. give hesitant unmotivated little nudge social pressure. one wants last person still masked. Unvaccinated people don‚Äôt believe covid vaccine never get vaxxed. also large group waiting whatever reason, people get vaxxed otherwise know they‚Äôll surrounded unvaccinated people won‚Äôt honest status. age bracket long enough full immunity even got first shot day approved age. many 375K deaths children 12? me, I'm happy things opening up. Glad get together friends family without mask. I'm also fine wearing mask grocery store. mean, what's big deal? Give bit time. get hardship folks continue bit time give people chance fully vaxxed. example, husband eligible lot longer time able actually get appointment. got date quickest could us luckily us, we'll past two week period right state (MA) opens completely. know plenty people least couple weeks behind us able get appointments. now, stores such, protected. suspend people's licenses DUI. make free country. examples stupid. need wait data vaccinated people What's bullshit it? specific. I‚Äôll absolutely say it‚Äôs weird seeing CDC jump ‚Äúvaccinated people don‚Äôt wear masks outdoors‚Äù ‚Äúvaccinated people don‚Äôt wear masks all‚Äù. CDC hasn‚Äôt consistent covid guidelines past year rarely heard peeps people worried CDC making right decision right now. I'll good day following science, yes :) And? article clear whether Biden donating doses delivered already US simply US allowing US production sites fulfill non-US orders. keep seeing people say ‚Äúkids resilient, they‚Äôll fine‚Äù

Not limit/complete restrict interactions peers point I‚Äôve seen articles posted kids almost scared play others afraid getting sick. love see it. I'm TX. done amazing job rolling vaccine. open everyone 18+ since end March. Even supply letting people get first come first serve. Yes, think important ability that. locations same. live fairly rural tiny town high rate state tourism here. find rates transmission go up, might need mandate masks local safety. next county town population without tourism. isolation may never need require mask. Different circumstances, different locations, different economies, might need different approaches. Enough people gotten avoid 3rd wave already though. basically ""removed"" half U.S. population vector transmission going see insane exponential growth hospital ICUs capacity covid patients Honest question, want recalled? Like done deserve opinion?  makes sense. around general public, normally people aren‚Äôt going close bank. That‚Äôs security. UK thousands people able go hospital cancer operation efforts focused treating COVID patients. moral issue, simple reality health services finite supply staff + facilities. OSHA expected issue guidance issues shortly. places keeping masks happens, point they'll follow whatever OSHA recommends. gives illusion still working combat spread reality they‚Äôve given preventing spread jumped herd immunity stage. show Florida lower half states. Stop bullshitting use source time. know numbers are. Sort ""deaths per million"" stop nonsense. liked photoshopping picture Dr Zheng Li-Shi. used random Chinese person real biohazard suit would noticed anything. We're going die. Someday. kind person No...we vaccinated. concerned plague rat liars about... It‚Äôs unfortunate jaunt put hold I‚Äôm sure people japan worriedly waiting get vaccinated watching government flounder comforted know patient little longer. Covid airborne virus. Humidity, UV rates, human behavior winter months, vitamin levels theorized influence infection rates. Infection rates skyrocketed past winter begun decline warmer weather, yes vaccines major role that, they‚Äôre going places poor vaccination rates well.

India, course contradicts everything said, believe that‚Äôs due human behavior outweighing seasonal fluctuations.

I‚Äôm random person internet though, don‚Äôt trust say without research.  Post ox, ergo propter ox. Yeah, CDC announcement going work people understand difference emergency use authorization normal approval.

But think that's large portion 'considering getting vaccine yet' population. figured talking grocery shopping general. specifically Target. everywhere target. Many places don't. year now. CDC says safe stop. say experts say.

We're opinion said things like? worried safety taking kid store, take kid store. controversial?

The reason ""if worried safety, stay home"" controversial. 

I'm necessarily disagreeing masks enforced. I'm disagreeing premises belief. Well following data all. It‚Äôs obvious vaccine eradicating symptoms deaths covid Oh man. Indiana store I‚Äôve seen someone Kohl‚Äôs. Kroger never anything sign door near me.  efficacy numbers better scientist expecting going this. 

They're resounding success. Simply pull actual scientific literature instead listening people, friends not. take tinfoil hat bullshit elsewhere. money valued lives, get. Hope works see abuse powers held countries severely limit personal liberties time, like New Zealand Australia. responsible used powers needed mitigate virus. Way way authoritarian ""overreach"" done leaders like Trump claim side personal liberties, see much protest claim sacred duty resist things.

If think covid mitigation really need fight loss personal freedom, almost certainly worrying wrong people. Dude think everyone fake calls lol I'm wondering that's set Wednesday - CT set 19th, NY I'd expect NJ follow. I‚Äôm shocked amount people know getting it, 50 Definitely. also help keep ask together. daughter can't wear one yet, go many places except distanced outdoor activities family events fully vaccinated family members.  giving sort personal info, reject trying make appeal authority.

So dont background statistics, got it. appeal authority ask qualified scold people criticize organizations topic require education interpret correctly. 30-point 95% confidence level 3 relevant cases. 1 case either way greatly changes number. 

Youre describing coincidence interval exists smart pants. relevant critique say ""the numbers would look different different"". situation large sample size expectedly low number relevant cases decently large interval, doesnt make invalid, wrong, given consistent studies. really appeals authority, huh?

Let spare future embarrassment tell idea fuck means, okay? Establishing credibility appealing authority. Saying *relevant* reputable source put data *not* appeal authority. ""It correct said so"" ""it meaningful organization access good data, likely well reviewed data, less likely many sources employ poor methodology"" thing, think lpud reddit commentor walking equal playing field anything else 'appeal authority', youre hell arguing hard higher number?

Im arguing for.any number, Im arguing analysis. Cdc gambling integrity american public, frankly fools bets lmao im scared. lol. go away We're good now. stop Walgreens pick 6-pack days.  Shit. Excuse error part, please. Kids generally get severe symptoms seems like society decided care long term affects them.  Biden announce Monday he‚Äôll export 20 million doses vaccines Pfizer Inc., Moderna Inc.

Meanwhile EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced Sunday bloc share coronavirus vaccines countries ""a better production situation state done good job rolling vaccine. open everyone 18+ since end March. girlfriend 2 weeks last shot.

I think thats quite right, thought less impacts? least know short term.  day care required masks kids employees whole time. take daughter out, can't work. disagree last bit. 

That necessary could happened anyone, regardless person. 

Now it‚Äôs happening people chose protected. Society isn‚Äôt obligated make sacrifices choose protected. people don‚Äôt choice. Don‚Äôt private schools decide policy? get totally fair comment. needs federal support. understanding, could wrong, long term complications likely come damage body causes symptomatic.

Great, that's I'll too.

No vaccine, school. 

It's like infections stop threshold private schools there's fee lol. Biden announce Monday he‚Äôll export 20 million doses vaccines Pfizer Inc., Moderna Inc. Johnson &amp; Johnson, top 60 million AstraZeneca Plc doses already planned give countries, according senior administration official familiar plan.

We're sending 80 million next 6 weeks. I'm sure released time. problem that. wasn‚Äôt premise conversation. Dude sick lot. let make time wants won‚Äôt use personal leave. texts lot saying he‚Äôs feeling well. also run peoples offices telling he‚Äôs sick feeling well going home.

It weird acting like hadn‚Äôt sick year Bc wore mask, def sick. I‚Äôve even sent home twice Bc looked sick, that‚Äôs last month. far definitive answers I‚Äôve seen people Polyethylene Glycol (PEG) Polysorbate allergies anecdotally people getting active chemo treatments. Everything else seems ‚Äúspeak doctor‚Äù actually think list people medically can‚Äôt get vaccine lot lower people realize. (like people HIV) may less protection vaccine still getting doctors guidance push people actual answer need government health care order reduce prices care US nothing will. ""partner"" Literally less month ago Fauci like ‚ÄúYo, keep wearing mask peoples gonna die‚Äù - like ‚Äúoh btw don‚Äôt need masks anymore - fun‚Äù

It‚Äôs hella confusing. continue wearing mine feel safe so. Also, hope get vaccine 6 months road it‚Äôs tested less capitalist battle push first vaccine. Oh -now- science  Many, however, saying screw office space rent plan keeping WFH. going board bit companies figure way want go. new C-level come change plant ""I'm charge now"" flag.

I'm personally hybrid model. WFH, days gather in-person meetings week two.  I'm hoping get past political BS normalize wearing masks cold flu season.

It's great sick past year!  share source material you‚Äôre relying assertion ‚ÄúChildren 12 significant risk shed light meant.
 
Sure. Children 1.3%-3.1% total reported hospitalizations, 0.1%-1.9% child COVID-19 cases resulted hospitalization Children 0.00%-0.21% COVID-19 deaths, 9 states reported zero child condition employment. condition wearing mask.

Regardless, employers require get covid vaccine covered FDA EUA premise faulty. I‚Äôm little high right live East Texas tell nobody wears masks around here. Skills competence suffer; grades Again, I'm US wrong. Face coverings illegal. ever see woman hijab burka? Lol wtf need. unvaccinated pose threat unvaccinated. 

If someone needs protected, walk get vaccine today. can't get vaccinated due medical reason, wear KF94/KN95/N95 employ social distancing. please continue wearing masks, sake. parents can't stop wearing mask. Total agreement. run small public library making long term hygienic changes polices procedures. so? feel like I'm simply consistent feel like I'm listening science.

I take precautions drive, get vaccinated flu season, got COVID vaccine need wear mask according experts. everyone access target many grocery stores removing mandates, especially WalMart, well known moving rural areas resulting small grocery stores nearby closing, leaving options. expecting pandemic impact quality life kidding themselves. includes parents want take kids Target.

And can't include people want wear mask inside instead?  problem CDC looking macro level, individuals care micro level making decisions.

The guidance wear masks early pandemic CDC trying make sure hospital workers could get PPE remain job. might good advice country whole, particular individual would better wear mask.

The question happening - CDC made announcement think help persuade people get vaccinated, helping everybody.... individual especially higher-spread area, makes sense keep wearing masks. communities still mask mandates. you‚Äôre confused. U.S. GIFTING 80 million doses. EU gifted tiny fraction that. Allowing Pfizer export fulfill contracts gift.

Fair enough, donation. Funny include AZ doses suddenly, think world awe 6 months stockpiling AZ doses approve never intended use, finally send U.S. allowing Pfizer export *and* gifting. effect far greater anything EU done.

You're still hundreds millions short, let's keep little greater effect doses even shipped. figures tell tale: 30 January 27 April* 2021, EU Member States approved export authorisation requests 148 million doses 44 destinations, including countries production capacities, high vaccination rates less severe epidemiological situation. 779 requests export authorisations received time, one EU allowed pretty much everyone export vaccine, sure trying tell, Von der Leyen quote. Well, kind 2 week window start opening things could end place. There's lot people going abuse one knows really happen. cautious remember people telling masks put aside people dithered enforcing them. lot pushing reopening willing risk poor people's lives hope work. I'm bioinformatics scientist  Ok large water droplets actually carry virus? analogy like saying fences cant stop cars lug nuts smaller gaps. Venn diagram people refuse get vaccinated refuse wear masks circle someone fully vaccinated contracts COVID-19, person still elevated risk blood clots even case mild? know downvoted. clearly worried. *‚ÄúWe still track get rid Blueprint June 15,‚Äù reported. ‚ÄúAs continue vaccinate people, it‚Äôs par expectations date,‚Äù Newsom continued, noted vaccine uptake public diminished slightly.* 
 
*‚ÄúIf continue see \[test\] positivity rates ‚Äî 1.1% ‚Äî stability, question, get June 15,‚Äù said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm confident kids wheelchairs? give fuck. really like going brunch getting haircut, I'll continue risk people's lives flu season eat avocado toast. Anyone wants vaccine point get vaccine.

Why even talk gonna wrong? immuno-compromised, ones risk, get vaccine. They're forced grocery shop still. dont background statistics, got it. 

I say all. Rather, I'm trying get address argument instead using logical fillies cover fact lost argument. describing coincidence interval exists smart pants.

I'm trying point study giant one small sample size. like appeals authority trying go credentials, resorting stupid little name-calling things like this, wrong. spare future embarrassment tell idea fuck means, okay? 

Ok, arguing for.any number, Im arguing analysis.

I gave list different studies. pointed outlier untrustworthy (small sample size. Literally, three cases). Yeah. grocery stores major service based chains following CDC guidelines local mask mandates.

Meanwhile tons businesses didn‚Äôt follow rules. Pasco county without mask mandates months.

If look Florida whole realized many different rules applied chaotic covid ridden mess. look one area (like Pinellas) consistent mask mandates rules would look like fine. case I‚Äôm sorry need stop epidemic growing unvaccinated let brain live lives. People say ‚Äúbut it‚Äôs immoral restrict unvaccinated only!‚Äù I‚Äôve enough living hellish life. enough questioning point is. actually want *live*. Chill out, recalled seeing headline China gave offered India supplies time ago. Great, what's benchmark reopening then? Talking like makes people wonder CDC made change safe want encourage getting vaccinated though I'm sure many people around world would love optics America shipping vaccines country nurses run ""Americans Only"" vaccine clinic. realize get spread covid vaccinated right?

When fuck go ""we know vaccination suppresses transmission"" ""the vaccine suppress transmission""?

Research [(here's John's confirmed expected along based thousands vaccines. Vaccination protects catching transmitting COVID-19. USA save world pandemic.

Just like WWI WWII

USA #1! MA'AM PROSTITUTE?! Kids die car accidents flu too. 

It's 287 kids millions infected. pre-existing conditions stay home wear mask vaccinated. alternative waiting like 3-4 months till vaccine comes out. Nah, doubt that. this.

I mean MAYBE jimbos bait tackle shop big trump flag outside, most.

I think masks may become quite bit common this. seriously got fucked hard Abbott Republicans. ‚ÄúHe ate fancy restaurant‚Äù probably answer. Kids can't demonstrate they've gained knowledge required graduate held back take summer courses, otherwise plenty kids take gap year two without destroying academic lives university. younger kids suspect struggle most. UK sure.

&amp;#x200B;

**Britain eases lockdown Covid variant India threatens summer Friday, announced U.K. would deliver surge vaccinations testing areas new Covid variant first detected India spreading. understood vaccines tested viruses worked youd understand dumb question. Nope. We've received anything yet. imagine trusting science That's I've seen suburb Los Angeles. southern part town republican heavy, I'd guesstimate maybe third people wear masks. like past year regardless mask mandates matter bad infection rates time. said I'd reply I'm busy, lots going on. could give half reply impatient. went exact road start pandemic, disastrous results.

The rural areas initially said ""it's city problem"" ignored precautions - sick people quickly overwhelmed rural medical services. shipped sickest people specialized care (usually near cities) died anyway.

It turns transmission potential Covid crowded rural church dangerous packed bar city, especially participants believe god protect need take precautions.

Relaxing Covid precautions national scope current level infection uneven vaccinations going generate another wave infections new variants - another wave deaths. üíî I'm sorry.

How handling this? That‚Äôs thought Gov. Murphy‚Äôs press conference today didn‚Äôt that. matter fact dodged question completely. still real idea New Jersey joining neighbors. school district??? could waited 4.5 freaking days.

So glad kid still virtual. like saying: ""I support laws drunk driving support mandatory."" make sense. I'm talking escape mutations.

But that's almost inevitable selective pressure.

I'm talking 10% community requiring hospitalization enough overwhelm many hospitals.

And half country unvaccinated. least California gave date.

*cries New Jersey* idea Covid-19 airborne that's new. *is* new public health authorities finally less clueless, publicly acknowledging reality. good news are, even though facepalm worthy took long.

Also, ""we"" knew this, sense people like us paying close attention along. huge numbers people nearly aware; think people still washing groceries, get memo there's little risk getting Covid contaminated surfaces.

Given many people still well-informed airborne transmission, beneficial media keep covering story, even boringly obvious us.  got yelled Walmart yesterday putting mask, even trying show vaccination card Neanderthal thinking statement spot on. least northeast, friend's mom working part time Walmart job tell people wear masks. screamed multiple times day point breakdowns never actually enforced it, remind outside store. can't people understand also care fear children too

Because done nothing belittle that? changed minds past 2 months. That's still position. brain american exceptionalism   Thank UC patient. Exactly, punish people endanger others, like drive influence, far aggressively people endanger themselves, like people drive without seat belts. Yuuuuup. comment section fucking shit show. People legit making statements requiring masks anti-science. Many businesses people immune issues. Maybe give month get together going right it. hard think others. pandemic taught us anything Americans selfish assholes world. trust antivaxx wear masks now? Loooooord I'm GA work hotel. I'm lucky see single guest wear lobby. used manager different departments lobby peak hours request people wear masks public spaces, kept getting screamed dropped 2 weeks. Inconsistent probably lot different factors play opening one, stability work force, places insured, secondary supporting businesses fully open. Give time.  disagree. trying keep getting bogged details. *Ugh...* Really annoying NJ dragging feet indoor mask mandate neighbor NY announcing end Wednesday. high hopes saw headline, wasn't.

Wonder they're coordinating like they've always wanted do. vaccinated 100% guarantee protection infection. 
 
People unironically think honestly insufferable. Prior 2020 badgering friends flying 100% safe?  They're far likely die car crash way store Covid. point people sub like deny science. Healthy kids virtually risk virus.  Begging question indeed logical fallacy sense used - 'inviting question' - fallacious. would say misuse phrase fallacious. saying ""meanwhile Europe"" link 21th March? Increase funding staff support health system then. Society shouldn‚Äôt lockdown practically forever. Key word ""perfectly."" Obviously immunocompromised ppl wear masks tbh mask wearing normalized moving forward general. 

You look issue larger scale individuals, otherwise miss forest trees. larger level, policies need place protect vulnerable, think case excessive quantity caution warranted considering cost. Look India, example. handled pandemic fine first, Indian media started pushing they'd solved pandemic done it, started going back normal. Now, bad be. Obviously, situation mildly different higher vaccination rate less population density, general sentiment done soon still lesson learn from. 

The cost continuing wear masks wide scale lower cost risking back near square 1. Given assessment, fact physically way tell someone vaccinated lying vaccinated wearing mask, everyone masking better policy decision. think coupled better vaccine education targeting many different preferred learning styles policies work fund future pandemic prevention. matter ""if"" we'll another pandemic, rather matter ""when,"" fully believe could easily within next decades learn nothing pandemic. This. pandemic worst here, spacing grocery shopping much possible wearing [p100 half-face switched regular kn95s got vaccinated.  thought getting groceries delivered, level protection realized would (in affect) paying money avoid people give weird looks. reality barely anyone noticed/cared. None made difference life, whatsoever. 


If pandemic taught anything, opinion average mouth-breathing rando public worth **less** nothing. say, care opinions others, openly ostracized something believe reasonable, there's actually chance something right wrong. accept life risks. things comfortable even though maybe risky. Another example would I'll back traveling, going concerts, weddings later year deadly flu season. know could potentially kill grannies spreading flu, worth able brunch friends mask up.

But risks different.. l them. really give fuck? figured talking grocery shopping general. specifically opinion said things like? 

Yes. I've CDC says since March. Yesterday went grocery store first time year. 

Anyone expecting pandemic impact quality life kidding themselves. includes parents want take kids Target. people wishing death Republicans sub daily months. mods either don‚Äôt care cheer on. Ohio? yessirr Many areas US fully open months without healthcare systems overwhelmed. higher vax rates us worried NHS overwhelmed, thats virus issue. Thats substantial lack healthcare issue. needed people present proof vaccination entering stores unmasked. honor system effectively useless. He‚Äôs far kind. Yes no. J&amp;J EMA approved single jab vaccine. communities rely it. Homeless shelters etc.  early, haven‚Äôt even hit herd immunity yet. Welcome tidal wave cases summer.... People might choose airline lets go maskless though. 

As saw retail, takes one changing policy rest follow.  It‚Äôs not, go store massless every day. Planes? way know either, would gamble vaccine literal virus harmful. based past viruses vaccines... pretty safe bet. people never going get vaccinated. gonna unmask eventually whatever happens. 

Plus even CDC statement, tons states already removed mask mandates. Yes, covid. Well, best tell anyway. get tested won't. said lockdown mom one visit grandma visiting friends dinner get tested positive grandma passed away host issues covid contributing cause. What‚Äôs 20 + 60? 20? 20? Asking friend 90% wearing masks target still. Minnesota seems pretty comfortable compared states. Wear mask inside please Count in. Really don‚Äôt think mask mandate lifted everyone vaccinated. continue wear one pride know cause suffering another human being. Empathy folks, care neighbor still wear mask guess Prop 13 doesn‚Äôt cover supplemental tax bills got two $1300 property tax bills addition normal astronomical property tax bills well. don‚Äôt know tell year year paid 20% higher last. got kids would love answer. 

Got anything beyond cheap accusations effective rates apples oranges comparison moderna/Pfizer J&amp;J. cursory google search tell  totally get loud argument 17 year old minimum wage worker trying enforce policy absolutely say setting :0)  That's stupid. 

Mass testing would result 50 false negative would go infect others. test, 50 false negatives go infect others? yep   aren‚Äôt living reality think 380 million people 200 vaccinated another 60-80 refuse get it, going wear masks summer. I‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôm honest. tell parents get vaccine blood clot scare hesitancy?  People would definitely shit selective reporting democrat too. Well that's lie. Walmart near every single person wearing mask. Masks next forseeable future, yes. Sadly lot fellow Americans mislead topic. little, mostly not. Part CDC's guidance.   Florida big state feel bad, know parents choicebut bring child puts children higher risk. I'd say people wear mask anyways build herd immunity  wonder many people would favor reinstating national 55 mile per hour speed limit, strictly enforce jurisdictions. We'd save thousands lives so. Including children's lives - auto accidents leading cause pediatric death.  wonder sort shared trauma different age groups developmental delays lockdown. certainly hope not

For generation 9/11, losing family members war, least one financial meltdown made high school pretty shitty another made finding job college nightmare. nesssarily.... Japan, may wear mask given that's would like do. also show respect others. even sick, still wear mask one going yell like dumbasses North America. else happy wear masks anymore? problems tbh... I'm fully vax'd ready return normal. People refuse get vax'd get fucked care... increased risks cases dropping quickly?  Give one country received majority vaccines US. Probably one two, it‚Äôs far typical situation world moment. agree Trump overreaching you‚Äôre giving people like power? bitched storm entire last 4 years probably got name put several lists. Here's Biden delivering news, too: Depending state, totally get one without parent's consent 18.  19, easiest way get anything offer feed me, haha.

I hope son gets soon! Sure, makes sense risk tolerance, wait months. Sucks pandemic isn‚Äôt lot people effectively is. 

The point still vaccinated without mask safer unvaccinated mask. cases drop background levels, get normalcy pretty quick.

Also kids, biologically data observations, makes sense younger are, less likely affected covid. ACE2 maturity antigen, kids lot less it. lot less virus grab hold infect. hill you‚Äôre gonna die on? 

Ok. chose this.... dude, nearly 50 million children age 12 living us. That‚Äôs 15% population country. Also, particular portion population particularly good spreading disease noted every pediatrician modern world. 

And you, personally, may actually ever bother talking child, guarantee breath air, touch objects children daily. Quite honestly claim wise one dumbest comments I‚Äôve seen Reddit today.

Furthermore, I‚Äôm sure arrived ‚Äúkids don‚Äôt spread disease don‚Äôt see them‚Äù seriously, seriously reconsider.

Also, let‚Äôs talk comment even relevant parent comment even comment completely ludicrous. enjoy reading next 10 seconds block you, really, one needs ignorance. children mask fine  always going true. Take, instance, leading cause death among children car accidents. take child anywhere inessential, literally putting life line. really EVER take child shopping could die car wreck, catch flu die? Best keep safe home. wish state would pull mandate back bit earlier too, I‚Äôm guna belligerent asshole ask us wear mask couple weeks longer. No, competing example question isn‚Äôt relevant that‚Äôs what‚Äôs trying used cheap win. doctor friend even *believe* lyme disease, thinks people malingering. also said covid probably bad, back beginning. knew guy developed *severe* allergy red meat tick bite. time guessed probably deer blood injected blood gave autoimmune thing, turned true surprised something similar happen lyme bacteria. would fail see betrayed trust first, trust keeping healthy I, one, welcome new mRNA overlords!  going wear mask forever? commend that. Thank you. thought harmless movie reference. Target area definitely did. Wal-mart here.  know effective vaccines diabetics? like, keep hearing everywhere immunocompromised people might get sufficient antibodies vaccine absolutely idea diabetes falls umbrella  know mean. siblings got first one could one finished vaccines got first last week. Nowhere near ‚Äúeveryone wanted vaccine already.‚Äù

I‚Äôve fully vaccinated 2 months, wearing mask without complaint didn‚Äôt want risk others. don‚Äôt understand mentality ‚Äúwell I‚Äôm vaccinated won‚Äôt wearing mask.‚Äù

Good luck you. hope you‚Äôre able fully vaccinated soon ease worries bit. gotten Covid? Means lower risk  hypothetical original premise, choosing get vaccinated covid adversely affect others. nonvaxxer might rather remain diligent masker social distancer. know. making assumptions imagining scenarios. What's difference? Prop 13 says first statement demonstrably false. Well governor caught cooking books Democrat. did. last week masks mandated. not, CDC deemed safe vaccinated

And going enforce non vaccinated people complying? internet go library.

And leave kids home also take parents right bring kids store important minimum wage employee's right safe abuse?

Why person's right comfortable important possibly infecting child? way, CA still need wear mask indoors now, grocery store 50/50 masked unmasked. little impact imagine.

Here OK we've single mask mandate whole time state grocery stores maybe 50% compliance mask wearing. Vaccines became widely available mid-April. Personally hyper-engaged getting vaccinated, even though beat eligibility date days (found spare) I'm still ""fully"" vaccinated today, CDC considers it.

I think makes sense wait adults eligible could gotten vaccine, plus time CDC says takes work. completely agree unvaccinated individuals high-spread areas keep wearing masks.

No, vaccinated well. 

95% efficacy means 20 unvaccinated people would gotten virus, 1 vaccinated. variants, 4 1. J&amp;J, 3 1.  
 
Obviously, protection kind counteracted vaccinated people start things raise chances compared unvaccinated (going crowded bars, etc). vaccines lower changes 1/20th, 1/4th, 1/3rd, stuff that's way likely expose virus, risk even go up. don‚Äôt care anymore.

If anti vaxxers don‚Äôt wear masks, mostly ones filling ER. That‚Äôs hospitals already seeing it‚Äôs going increase. love watching people spread disease. It‚Äôs like hobby.  One man interviewed article says continue double masking wearing goggles grocery store next five years, least. Makes wonder double masking covid even happened, then. think contexts makes sense wear mask OCD/OCPD. Wearing say, urgent care setting doctor clinic (where unknown infection may spreading) makes sense (after doctors professionals patients use hand sanitizer every interaction protocol there). Also, around immuno-compromised/ public transit flu seasons. Wherever makes sense evidence-backed public policy. Take look Israel (note--this article February 2021). crushing COVID-19 infection rate high vaccination  can't stand masks (I still wear mine about, love it), got vaccinated encourage others can. 

Maybe distaste masking exactly meant ""anti-masker,"" though. Huh? literally said leave don‚Äôt free mask give you??? * Wears mask goggles everywhere 
* Catches Covid anyway 
* Gets vaccinated Covid 
* Says wear mask goggles everywhere

What miserable life he's going have. I'm still upset CEO giving donations anti-LGBT groups boycotted Target many years ago. I'm really surprised they'd endanger employees consumers way.  It‚Äôs hard feel like misstep many ways. prepared another spike cases.  opposed Donkey party completely transparent like New York? UK extreme cause caution. One case fully vaccinated hospitalization. variants concerning, seems like vaccines working like should. Sick people love cough me. *Redeems cards.*

NO! NOOOOOO!!!! [Inaudible] NOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! duh? argument would valid water solid. mask always dry outside take off? Knowing happened 9/11 I'm unfortunately sure. could even see masks quasi-permanent part transportation like metal detectors. Newsweek ashamed themselves. Absolutely ashamed. Common cold flu (which latter basically eradicated time being) dangerous kids Covid. every public place bouncer checks everyone vaccine card something g?  accurate shit see it? Thank getting vaccinated. gotta group effort! fully support vaccinated folks going maskless, unfortunately trust anti maskers/antivaxxers all. simply lie go maskless everywhere. fine vaccinated people, kids 12? Things got lot less safe them. wish focus getting people vaccinated. We're what, 50%? that‚Äôs works flu, least far infants concerned. get flu shot third trimester infant protected flu. it‚Äôs drilled brain new baby visitors need tdap flu shot. need research keep CDC guidelines though rtfa? rtfa? Experts? Yeah, 4th grader could predict one. tier system significant holes open up. restrictions mirror actual risks well. Masks outside mostly meaningless, remain place tiers CA. changes number indoor places (where almost viral spread actually happens) open.

The tier system spells guidelines carefully via measurable metrics. confuse metric 'science'. degree aligns epidemiology disease much less scientific. you‚Äôre vaccinated shouldn‚Äôt matter. got vaccination could confidently wear mask give shit entitled people got shot not. kids can't. It‚Äôs certain extent, also, understanding mRNA tech, doesn‚Äôt protect viruses way. Older vaccine methods, like method used Covaxin, does, virus mutates (which hopefully wont) far away original strain. becoming conspiratorial, stop saying something stupid.

And yes, even year. coronavirus notably transmissible flu. per capita basis, children flu considerably deadlier. case wasn‚Äôt clear enough, means amount kids infected flu covid, notably die flu even get seriously ill. I'm going theater psychologically manipulate pieces shit refuse vaccinate. college degree doesn;t confer common sense upon recipients. shit Saying won‚Äôt last it‚Äôs foregone conclusion based fact. sounds tough, see another comment mentioned PTSD. talked doctor get anxiety hump?

There may way reframe mind. instance, thinking even get side effects, like rite passage. symbol transition back normal life. know thinking positively like helps you, might. say ""shame"" mean everyone trusts science clearly look upon antisocial behavior, something normal. No, I'm going go street people masks harass them. However, best discourage much possible social pressure. experts right (but one going listen them) big difference people wearing masks beginning pandemic actively putting others risk, people still want mask awhile longer aren‚Äôt endangering anyone. ""People scientists think know better scientists. 11"". really.. really..

I mean maybe maybe knows. want get people take shots convince want best paying politics, build trust staying politics. dog owners wish places dog friendly. think would cool, multitude valid reasons spaces pets rules. wish people like cousins realized hard makes others, it‚Äôs fun thing/convenience it‚Äôs medical necessity.

I spend much time arguing people usually end saying they‚Äôre hassling many people taking advantage days, buying ‚Äúservice dog‚Äù harnesses dogs clearly aren‚Äôt trained service. It‚Äôs exhausting new environments get lot anxiety inevitably go whole explanation/defense. I‚Äôm saying people vaccinated wear mask. Even people pro vaccine may finally received vaccination within last couple days wear mask

Got way back claim up? Besides ""I know people vaccinated still get covid.

Sure, far less likely symptomatic. even symptomatic far less likely danger. still areas still good amount community spread.

If case areas free follow CDC knows original guidance say vaccinated people gather other.

CDC updated guidelines based several recent published papers articles reputable simply trying get others vaccinate keep hearing people complain saying whats point getting vaccine still wear mask.

Source? situations science continue mask. implication CDC says situations continue mask, continuing wear mask situations anti-science. That's incorrect. want emphasize continuing wear mask situations perfectly fine, still 'anti-science'. ‚ÄúEverybody Lies‚Äù business requires mask, instead people spending money elsewhere, lie argue privilege give money people would rather spend elsewhere. Literally ""shut take money."" fuck extinct? Costco SLC signage stating masks required vaccinated people. saw many people wearing trump anti-mask shirts wearing masks. people either smacked heads every branch cognitive dissonance tree fell, clearly lying....golly gee, wonder which... point speed regulated. car seats, licenses, inspections, registrations, cops enforcement. 

It‚Äôs ridiculous comparison highly contagious virus. Exactly. I'm saying COVID risk kids tiny isnt rational worried it. Vaccinated people continue wear masks trust anti-vax anti-mask crowd nobody allergic peg,

You moved goalposts. said there's ""nothing besides mRNA surrounded lipids vaccine there's way people could history reactions."" Well ingredients people exist history bad reactions them.

You'd know kinda person though, since probably avoid long named ingredients food eat end spending 12h twitching next toilet vomiting. describe and/or already severely ill immune disease getting vaccine. Right people acting situation over. finding new variants time worse original get stopped vaccine. long chastising people safe it? Like wait till absolutely kills 50 percent people get force them? become deadlier form polio attacks respiratory system instead? question. mean, group terrorists tried abduct Michigan governor restrictions...  even care happens vaccine crowd?  Yup lie, likely die catch COVID. Oh well Typical Canadians take expert understand Americans people lie... Deaths important statistic, infections is. kids may likely survive, capable spreading unvaccinatted people adult. Cases half month ago dropping. number important raw vaccinated percentages? Yeah, comments someone saying vaccine now, problem dead inside year care. sentiment expressed thread, though mostly less harshly.

I several kids cannot receive vaccine. sick ""your kids probably survive"" ""there's solid chance kids wind lifelong disabilities"". folks DMing quarantining child abuse calling CPS beyond pale. Exactly. See, understand nationwide speed limit 25 save kids lives, would harm good. people dont understand this. ""if SavEs oNe LiFe"" people, say ""800k die heart disease every year. support mandatory diet exercise program?"" government force hand? anyone care people choose mask? mandates gone, enjoy life I‚Äôll enjoy mine. started wearing masks CDC guidance beginning anyway. curiosity, why? Especially restaurant can‚Äôt follow basic public health guidelines customers see back kitchen anywhere people can‚Äôt see? Fuck rules airplane logic get. practical standpoint, mean. might correct air circulation, question safe really is. Times, high top ten list best ways get sick ""take flight somewhere"". I‚Äôve read different reports, think time tell hopefully news good news. WON‚ÄôT BELIEVE NUMBER TWO! Yes, think fair remove masks. Sorry people, sucks. may never reach herd immunity, time everyone else go back normal.

For immunocompromised, really bad point can't get vaccinated serious risk Covid, take personal precautions, wearing N95 mask, ordering groceries Amazon, going public.

These people must hard, sucks them, prudent force entire country antisocial would help minuscule group people. There's reason mandate masks Covid, even would probably help immunocompromised well. lockdown anyway.   Reminds security theater planes now. Everyone must wear mask else kick plane!!! Unless course munching free crackers give bad coffee - surely can‚Äôt catch covid eating snacks! Exactly. also problem of:

* immunocompromised

* understand vaccinated 100% ""immunity"", merely high degree resistance (*YOU STILL GET IT* get fucked it)

* virus itself, since mutate large unvaccinated population huffing others' faces help that

* everyone vaccinated previously it, since resistance wear time

I'm still going wear mask. many unvaccinated idiots ruining shit everyone. Childless person spotted cdc still call masks everyone mass transit, hospitals, prisons?  Same! honestly would love normalcy wear masks grocery stores, really enjoyed cold/flu free year finally, largest nursing union US disagrees CDC.
 
So? Nurses great people, vast majority excellent caregivers. nurses epidemiologists. infectious disease specialists. virologists. access sophisticated spread models world.
 
Accepting advice nurse's union infectious disease - advice consistent CDC - accepting advice UAW. predict another notorious self-own CDC.

In 3-6-9 weeks cases exploding going come back admit wrong? state below-average vaccinated rate handful folks still wearing masks yesterday... sad stressed felt like back April 2020.  Omg brigading makes much sense. I've trying diplomatic possible expressing concerns CDC announcement last couple days. downvoted hell felt like going crazy when, least, controversial decision given many PhDs/MDs/epidemiologists/ex-CDC people come it. True, life isn‚Äôt zero risk. There‚Äôs certain amount risk we‚Äôre going take able function society. line sand. varies everybody. far I‚Äôm concerned risk children getting severely ill Covid low I‚Äôm gonna overly worried that.  ""Every possible"" - could lower speed limits would undoubtedly save kids. sound like every possible regulation me. expert, mask Social Distancing lowered cold/flu?

Logically things, social distance, staying home wearing mask lower spread COVID-19. know figure one things responsible lowering cold flu? Oh, gotchu. also makes sense. might come shock people care themselves. argument case would become projectile MVA, disagree general. Yes were. Inside businesses forced wear mask. work clinic sees plenty people everyday wore masks. Every single store people forced wear masks. Like said gym everybody wore mask. live around plenty anti maskers well point forced wear mask. logic don;t worry things statistically puny, exeption covid. don;'t worry struck lightning, dont worry dying car crash way work, dont worry food poisoning, worry kids covid. Why? isn;t rational concerned something uncommon. 

&amp;#x200B;

Your kids liekly die normal flu covid-19. never close schools it, never worry all.   I'm american say us biggest fucking liars world.

The rest politicians. Oh yes, full-on wave unlikely (although possible southern states low vaccine percentages). still significant community transmission happening. I've saying things probably look quite different June, we're clearly transitional period May. think month soon mask announcement. 


As per data here, cases seem started increasing may 9th. rapid increase point, still appear increase. 20% low, far. 


Could statistical fluke, think likely real increase result relaxation. I'm hoping increase stays small, us (like me) eligible vaccine yet... makes think that?

Source: Fully vaccinated UFC fan Thanks info! really depends are, stage things locally. generally bad scenario could get, short 2nd term Trump ordering masks gone without vaccines. We're already seeing significant pushback media doctors epidemiologists, really destroys last notions ""the CDC follows science"" narrative. insane think CDC become corrupted business influence DeJoy running post office. hope pandemic awakening some. I'm frustrated friends pro-science suddenly become anti-science. seems like expectation wear masks years virus circulating, be, even though good scientific reason vaccinated people wear them. performative driving crazy. happy vaccines working well we're coming side this. I'm not. I've considered it, seen anything definitive that. Seems pretty rare though. According Joe Rogan Florida fine Lolllls keep hearing people catch Covid mutations occur, vaccine become less effective. today 120M US residents Fully Vaccinated, leaves 200m bodies gestate new Super Covid strain. still see asking non-vaxers honest wear mask going actually work. 

They want share now, would change? feel vindicated like battle. Continuing wear mask anti-science.

It's ok continue wearing mask, recognize *is* anti-science. essentially doubting efficacy vaccines. Which, again, fine, call horse horse. Ahh icic thanks info! year. don‚Äôt see CDC doesn‚Äôt give clear advice. That‚Äôs job. 

They failures since couldn‚Äôt even develop simple covid test year half ago. got tests, couldn‚Äôt used unless China.  Thing is, I'm increasingly hesitant associate reopening projections Memorial Day (or specific predetermined date holiday). want risk setting failure (very possible) outcome Memorial Day arrive, governor still maintains restrictions. such, I'm kind conservative predictions, expecting long side, i.e. early mid June, btw emergency mandate set expire. 

Obviously there's good chance could happen well that, possibly even Memorial Day, personally - I'm saying case *everyone* - I'd rather things suddenly turn *better* initially expected (a good surprise) *worse* initially expected (a bad surprise). CDC's new guidance blue glaring example former; actually expecting wear masks indoors June July NJ anyway, even Murphy's unexplained delay there's *too* big loss. 

Same logic Dr. Fauci uses makes cautious predictions often criticized overly pessimistic. He's *major* public health official, many missteps could lead poor track record cost career, prefers going ""safe"" side terms predictions. He'd rather things turn *better* predicted *worse*. 551 new COVID-19 cases still **a ton** cases, great see tide turning. might never get covid zero, damn good start. Tens thousands people die annually flu. could done save lives. CONCLUSIONS.¬†In adults hospitalized severe COVID-19, use convalescent plasma associated significant improvement clinical status day 28. However, significant improvement mortality observed, warrants evaluation.

So better nothing least? They're trying depoliticize pandemic. know people going take masks unvaccinated (they also know already happening). they're \*trying\* turn medical issue instead political one. getting life back relative normal.. accept perfect strategy.. lean doctors get many patients vaccinated possible. worries USA prepared variant /s  I'm going sit back drink chai chaos unfolds. Eh... think way different 1920s. time tell sure. 

But much actual security risk it?  Yeah I‚Äôve actually really impressed good kids masking pretty ironic guy interviewed extreme protocol ended getting COVID anyway.

I could see planes flu season. long trip plane usually end getting sick degree another. wonder affect business. I‚Äôm vaccinated I‚Äôm sure want go it‚Äôs socially responsible. janky ass napkin math lol Try county website Children older five wear mask September. Problem solved. mean first yes use thick multilayered mask effective though inside typically wet 2, water breath mask water droplets didnt make past mask thus didnt make unto air. whole argument said helps prove correct. immune escape, literally risk increased transmission overtaking vaccination levels. legitimate concern, much think able cope. Exactly. every unvaccinated person ‚Äútaking risk.‚Äù children immunocompromised rely others around protect them. than.. you. 

Do care sew thousands die? 500k far? ""oh well, gives fuck got mine!""  one right spread disease. Lifting mask mandates allow people exactly that. Thank you. changed mind getting AZ vaccine.  Great news, hope rollout goes smoothly This. I'm week second vaccine settled, many people going go maskless immunized fact generally get sick EVERYTHING.. keeping mask on. Many states already laws. used mainly keep KKK wearing masks public. mean may same, thing. think flu period asymptomatic transmission, example. stupid.  testing would result 50 false negative would go infect others. test, 50 false negatives go infect others?

*‚ÄúTherefore, know even mass testing conducted, mandatory quarantine still necessary,‚Äù said.*

I take English strong suit. alright ... bit overblown. Think like handle mask culture Asian countries - sick, going crowded place low airflow like public transport, wear mask. Otherwise probably fine without. I'll probably keep one car save grocery store places tight lines, like bank. Nuance gets lost you‚Äôre trying provide message clearly large number people. got important part message it‚Äôs best wait 2 weeks second dose fully vaccinated. Dude, 100% *can* believe anti-mask sentiment out.

Honestly though, since trump 2016, illusions stupid irresponsible people are. saying pandemic nationwide? Certain countries experiencing worst peaks. 

At least USA I'm beginning feel tide shifting Covid doesn‚Äôt mutate quickly. haven‚Äôt mutation changes much. new variants since January 2020 it‚Äôs never issue  Haha. I've tried too!!! metro health authority already announced won‚Äôt publish covid data weekends going forward. Cherry-picking Sunday data feels like cheating, regardless political party.

Frankly, Texas California arrived similar results year-plus despite different approaches. California (maybe) overbearing freewheeling Texas large metros‚Äô responsible push back thank limiting outbreak locally. You, Madam/Sir, simply possess intelligence people. get voted? people really believe you? vaccine effective without everyone else masking up, point vaccine? first article says clothe masks less effective medical grade masks. one ever said wasnt true. makes remark comparison masks 3 groups clothe mask, medical mask, ever mask typical policy given time tends medical mask. sure ""clothe masks worse medical grade masks"" proves masks dont work.

The second one doesnt even mention masks unless include testing equipment mask ""mask"" keep outside particles air well anything else getting patient test. mask patient test outside world breath patient. Ah, old ‚Äòget fucked kid 12.‚Äô

Everyone know who‚Äôs jumping ditch mask vaccinated. guess days taking masked kid grocery store ending again. Hopefully vaccinated fall go somewhere besides preschool (which strict mask rules sanitizing procedures) next year. daughter asthma too. can't talk wanting keep asthmatic child safe without getting ridiculed downvoted. People say affecting kids, asthma risk factor, CDC website date still listing risk factor, etc. really monsters there. would risk child's health. need many vaccines arms possible, even countries following 0 covid principle starting fail infectious variants. Sorry, point everyone chance get vaccine, live life risk. Awesome, finally end date cali. Hopefully goalposts stick time. Diabetes issue; diabetics included clinical trials showed similar effectiveness groups. Go it. Nah, actually good. Opening right away would early, gives teens time get shots. CA is, last I'd heard, still expected one states able reach herd immunity. We're okay, need another month vigilance we'll woods.  best buy work still requires them, think it'll probably take company wide city wide mandate make stop wearing them.

I'm double vaxxed really care keep not. I've gotten used face really bother Good, good, good. right thing do. long residents Anaphylaxis, course. Yep know I've telling everyone giving great 802.11a/n. going enforce non vaccinated people complying? 

Why anyone enforce it? people risk made decision wear mask, made decision get vaccinated likely wearing mask leave kids home also take library?

What think? library requires masks, yours? not, think anywhere else someone may able use computer grocery parents right bring kids store important minimum wage employee's right safe person's right comfortable important possibly infecting child?

This comfort, safety. [Several employees attacked even longer makes sense put employees harms way like OK we've single mask mandate whole time state grocery stores maybe 50% compliance mask wearing.

So perhaps mask mandate makes less difference imagining number people wearing masks. thats SoCal, still mask mandate. effective diabetics.

diabetics immunocompromised, they're talking severely immunocompromised people often talking people immune system wiped certain kind cancer treatments, genetic conditions make super vulnerable types infection.

here's little info muh freeeeedoms. Fact. I‚Äôm getting second week. Children older two wear mask September. Problem solved. There‚Äôs evidence prove covid beat vaccines. don‚Äôt make policy decisions based Reddit speculation answering question ask already know answer to. Go elsewhere. much value liberty? able shoot personal machine gun neighbors houses? want infringe liberty, would you? 

I figured we're insanely overdramatic pointless would joint comically bad faith fact 50% population (including ineligible kids) gotten least 1 dose disagrees Good. Let's get back normal. one's refused wear masks refuse get vaccine change. want continue wear mask (especially older folks), so. think really need start moving virus. Domestically, we've done basically can, others done they're willing. people take really telling lame joke. noticed lot people blatantly ignore rules safety precautions around covid ones trying argue people treating unfairly. hard care happens anyone even trying safe especially around others. NC, lifted mandate vaccinated people (NC actually one higher vaccination rates country). went Walmart today noticed people maskless realizing mandate lifted. I'll probably give another week 2 myself, want anyone mistaking republican. Hey voicing support arguments reasoning. people think? Covid analyzed Pfizer vaccine sequence working new ‚Äúvaaaarriant‚Äù overcome it? LOL enjoy pandemic friends kids? flu vaccine even close 100% effective, people (such newborns) unable get vaccine.

More precautions need taken order save everyone flu. real. Murphy making god damn mess this. Like get right away factors play least give us idea he's thinking. agree strawmanning unreasonable?  Thank update guidance! It‚Äôs great variety vaccine options reason. Anyone immune issues talk doctor. yesterday saw someone say couldn‚Äôt get vaccine fibromyalgia there‚Äôs absolutely misunderstanding can‚Äôt get example hypothetical. known issue predictable measurable. estimation family‚Äôs problems one obesity entirely hypothetical. example could get disability money state. 

Aside hypothetical, example gave shows problem isolated family. societal problem case. family could easily choose support overweight person.

When spread COVID choosing to
vaccinate, potentially harm every family encounter. I‚Äôm sorry argument doesn‚Äôt hold discussion.  achieve goal regardless.  act like saw employees personally enforcing it. people happen following rules location mean employees anything differently. vaccinated completely safe, told keep masking certain situations? different coronavirus going around public transportation Target? people confused worried doesn‚Äôt make sense say germs change depending CDC lied before, like told us beginning masks didn‚Äôt anything? get impression watching CDC interviews they'll vaccinating younger kids September. reminds detective series used watch TV came back school. hypochondriac main character would act like guy article. I'm saying CDC full crap. I'm saying I'm expecting anti-vaxxers lie fucking asses cause least people die unnecessarily thanks rolling back mandate.

I understand trusting people selfish assholes may right ""American"" thing do, knowing full well hordes people going exactly still makes upset. Yeh eastern Washington fairly enforced. Back august saw r/publicfreakout moment guy flipped couldn‚Äôt check stuff since wasn‚Äôt wearing mask Honestly it‚Äôs logical thing they‚Äôre hoping anti-vaxxers anti-maskers get infected get quickly get us closer herd immunity, killing tens thousands process. Criminally unethical course though. you, hope too. ‚ÄúWearing mask indoors awhile longer rates [of vaccinated people] higher.‚Äù

How noble her. rest us vaccinated people recognize pose threat feel like used social leverage enforce masks defiant group people unlikely heed restrictions private lives anyway. 

I'm going go back living life mask-free blessing CDC, Biden, Cuomo. Thanks. immuno-compromised, ones risk, get vaccine.

And ain't ever gonna get vaccine. wait year unmask, still vulnerable next year. mean, infertile vaccine. 

Then again, infertile would strange changed... say keep mask knows flip flop kind horrified amount people saying they‚Äôll mask look like certain affiliation. level self obsession looking morally pure sad. BS argument mostly used blind supporters. rely mass behavior get pandemic. That‚Äôs BS. mean it‚Äôs reason laws. People elected, governments elected something, people given entity, can‚Äôt rely behavior. Government must enact rules laws, lead example.  First off, idea herd immunity exists. different area, community. think Manhattan threshold upstate New York? number throwing best guess real world backing thresholds much lower diseases. end day idea actually falls.

3.8 Million adults fully vaxed NJ, really think adding little going huge impact?

Also, figuring % folks natural immunity catching it. include them, likely easily 70% mark, include vaccinated folks even though done. 

If data driven there, case numbers plummeted likely near floor (although hard tell 30% deletion rate state currently pulling) number people fully vaccinated 30 days tiny compared number fully vaccinated now. Demand waned significantly getting massive push 65% 70% suddenly eradicated virus. 

He backed corner doubled down. numbers today finally gives significantly improved near bottom already. really think decision data driven watching data much. think adding hybrid remote options would big selling point companies recruitment retaining employees. people craving better work life balance pandemic showed us it‚Äôs possible within corporate world. interesting see trends emerge bc i‚Äôve seen talking points wanting return old office life others seeing benefits WFH expenses employee satisfaction. different variants would different impacts? report new variants? anti science ask. Australia NZ, Zero Covid countries mass testing quarantine, suffered supposed false positive problem? Ummm US highly vaccinated? personally can‚Äôt count amount people vocally vaccines. county lucky break 50%.   take time mask comfort level. you‚Äôre vaccinated safe around understand pivot hard address mentally ""if think problems bad, wait see solutions!""  ...please explain refuting argument pointing logical fallacy *ad hominem* attack. ü§¶‚Äç Yeah, still better vaccinated Supposedly B117 50% transmissible original B1617 40% transmissible B117. B1617 2.1x transmissible original... Yeah letting someone inject vaccine literally hasn‚Äôt even existed long enough see harmful effects, instead taking care body immune system. morons. problem one dying forced wear mask. non-zero number children die change CDC guidance. even number ends &lt;100, reason kids died people want inconvenienced wearing masks. need experts that. Disobeying government Americans forte. Democrats freak fucknout Republicans control Republicans freak fuck Democrats control. given moment nearly half population actively resisting government. beautiful system almost guaranteeing societal change come government.  even use sinovac

The fuck? Thats lie wtf thats strange. CDC vet numbers post??? Driving car hurt people. even kills them. Time hand license.  fucking joke Yes think narrative switching personal risk assessment instead protecting herd vaccine widely available US works. Unfortunately children immunocompromised people unable get vaccine one really addressing issue right now. CDC didn‚Äôt tell everyone safe unmask, fully vaccinated people. vaccinated think risk small (at least initially) I‚Äôm basing science multiple studies published. Also small chance kids react like adults. Luckily kids mostly immune mild cases. need back school unless underlying condition . Mentally kids suffering. Children poor homes even greater disadvantage without open schools. data American academy pediatrics Anyone else age 12 go get vaccine today

Not today, within week so, 12 13 year old can't get week. aunt 70's able get first shot. They're still vaccinating 2 million day appointments taking week many places. mention time shots time vaccine work effectively. say anyone go get vaccine today.  realize like 30+ million adults US immunocompromised due taking corticosteroids NSAIDs immunosuppressants (mainly autoimmune disorders)? means even they're vaccinated, vaccine may unknown reduced efficacy them. Furthermore, many states eligibility opened April 15th-19th ""essential"" workers even opportunity considered fully immunized yet, even managed land appointment first week eligible. inconvenient wear mask wear shirt. debate?

Because much, much, much inconvenient uncomfortable shirt. least me. There‚Äôs extremely high chance don‚Äôt covid. Especially rapid test coming back negative. understand taking PCR peace mind also comes back negative wouldn‚Äôt stress much. lay low feel better, likely way shift Friday. low grade fever likely gone well vaccinated went store without mask first time year. nice feel like judged people wearing them. Store probably 60/40 masked unmasked. make wonder vaccination rate. city lifted mask mandate. also assure people unvaccinated maskless. see signs requiring staff mix. 

I boat unless location requires CDC changes rules, wearing one. said get sick future happy normalized mask wearing. hope people take precaution go future sick think you‚Äôre conspiracy theory territory. Fairfax County VA population 1.2 million. would‚Äôve people affected you‚Äôre thinking. Yes, thing CDC vaccine card. one got county PA probably one. Mine given county level WY, CDC vaccine card. Google ""CDC vaccine card"" see looks like that. Practice safe socializing. oddly oddly religious people commanded lie.  Right! I'm absolutely exhausted lumped antivaxxers. kids get vaccines instant able so. can't yet, people stop saying things like, ""Anybody vaccinated yet..."" ignoring population people can't get vaccinated.

And that's say nothing fairly large population can't get site problematic work hours, time off, limited transportation. folks ones need most, too. assumption car, don't, options limited. assumption time day, don't, options limited. assumption childcare, options limited.

Many states working hard address many concerns, fact takes time energy. time energy things physically mentally healthy people often make space for, everybody physically mentally healthy.

Governors, politicians, social media commenters seem forgotten everybody situated exactly way are. people say, ""Everyone,"" way conspicuously excludes people, pretty obvious.  Exactly. Maybe different states different regard. I'd like see evidence, hear opinion. ""90% doctors brush crest"". OK, why? They‚Äôve already started trials 6 mo - 12 y.o. Hang there. I‚Äôm ready 2 year old are. you‚Äôre kid practice safety measures. Masks, social distancing, avoid republicans religious fanactics, know, usual! matter? I‚Äôm vaccinated, waiting wear mask since early Feb. Finally! Exactly Yay! Please report back get it! parents can‚Äôt go work one two weeks isolate children test positive Man thought nottheonion post. fuck immunocompromised, cancer patients, kids can‚Äôt get vaccinated. family members kids thousands willfully unvaccinated die. wife fully vaccinated, Pfizer.  But, immunocompromised 9 yo son, wearing masks regularity least thought summer (and assuming vaccine kids cards start next school year). Sucks, bringing home mild infection (for us) could spell trouble kid. CDC guidance seems rushed, maybe primarily situation clouding picture. love Dr. Lucy McBride says ""We never promised risk free existence."" 

COVID really screwed ability assess risk. People easily lie. Anti-Vac children public schools required full shot record. Except take account millions millions kids get vaccine. take account 65% becomes lot smaller number. number nationally around 36% give take. far ways away 60-70 percent.... honor system, lol, like southern border? Thanks setting standard, (p)resident mumbles! wearing mask situations CDC said longer necessary, doubting efficacy vaccines denying science.

The person acting like child one perhaps tied identity 'following science' plugging ears refusing clashes personal risk assessment. Which, again, fine, least guts admit it. made lol. Thanks! Ugh. ESA would never try bring store public place. It‚Äôs pretty much housing protection. people frustrate give people ESAs bad name create distrust actual service animals. Fact anti vax anti mask people haven‚Äôt right thing entire time. least area, there‚Äôs mandate one enforced someone doesn‚Äôt want mask, zero repercussions. So, people aren‚Äôt masking area previously LIKELY vaccinated. ones would use excuse mask vaccinated, whole time. thing think okay get emotional support certificate cuz apartment complexes backwards rules regulations dog sizes/breeds. mean 20lb limit? That's nothing dog, see people labs walking around turned away? Unmasked people vaccine required Yeah, seems like CDC acknowledging can‚Äôt end COVID US, since we‚Äôre even projected reach herd immunity point. they‚Äôre issuing guidance intended keep people hospitalized dying. People risk COVID fully vaccinated months now, middle aged people young adults one shot gives partial immunity greatly reduces chances bad COVID infection, children always low chance bad case abysmally low chance death COVID. 

They‚Äôre basically saying know COVID continue spread US, people longer dying going hospital nearly rates saw vaccines. that‚Äôs OK. Life isn‚Äôt risk free, it‚Äôs unreasonable CDC governments completely eliminate risk COVID life goes back normal. Patrick shit sherlock! don‚Äôt get protected well.  Fair point United States filled selfish assholes possible. Yeah, fucking shit. already see liars taking masks think bullshit. going really rough time actually solving problem many ignorant people proudly declaring dont care educated people think ""Impending Doom"" thing really top. 100% trust CDC handled things, trust Biden Fauci they're saying okay I'll listen diapers now. hard get?! ;)  forget people spread others. So. Fuck people can't get vaccinated yet. Right? recommendations directly contradicted recommendations way many occasions take anything say grain salt.  old kids? CDC lost ton trust credibility last year masks...it's surprise distrust still lingering. People also traumatized it'll take time people get back normal. work, much smaller yours, said could go maskless May 1st. Nothing vaccinated, longer required.

I hate wearing mask, gotten second shot yet, kept mine days ago, second shot week passed. vaccinated coworkers coming work asking everyone still wearing mask why? 

It refreshing see minority though, half people kept masks on, started going without fully vaccinated. sorta pop bubble. wife vaccinated went gym swam pool. felt pre covid. experience seeing people smiling mask free public anxiety melts away.

I already decided point either vaccines work im done im still done this. Still anxiety though.  takes expert conclude people lie vaccine status? Sherlock? certainly get vaccine prevent catching covid. lot people wondering clear message before. know CDC political movements using fear tool get people cautious take precautions pertaining Covid. feel like knew risk children relatively small didn‚Äôt wanna share information order maintain Covid compliance. Oh, dear...

Should someone tell catmoon? heart... advice evolved pandemic situation evolved. new well understood first, learn more, recommendations change. Every time we've done tests, get result. vaccines work. I‚Äôm definitely getting vaccinated, however respect others wearing mask doors. know lot people same, however would bet large sum money thousands liars there. Nobody deny someone doesn‚Äôt mask they‚Äôre probably vaccinated. I‚Äôm vaccinated I‚Äôm still wearing mask. Might wanna check Singapore fully vaccinated people tested positive new Indian variant also already country far infectious.

But yes, time pretend A-OK half ass things yet ""need get back normal"". poorly managed infected (pun intended) politics embarrassing.

You place lot trust common sense agency swayed repeatedly political pressure even bill ramping people getting restless lack real government help people. new variants time bomb new mask directive terrible decision especially time. Next gonna tell water wet.   stopped someone‚Äôs friend disagreement something neither qualified understand? 

nice.  That's nobody brains options kind work pay.  It‚Äôs bullshit prove got vaccine anyways say?! Yes long? like variants earlier year, right? Yes, pools highly regulated.

You seen much paperwork neighbor fill purchase swimming pool Walmart. Honesty 

And me, I'd bet life savings none breakthrough deaths healthy 18 year old, let alone active 18 year olds part ad hominem attack? Um.. became available people 12 Thursday. daughter one first get it, week. 0 immunity vaccine far. Yeah, surely there'll high level community transition majority population vaccinates trying figure Bahrain many infections despite high vaccination level. Sinopharm needed know, thank you! got really, really bad cold February. Fever everything. COVID-19 antibodies afterward, know it. Everybody know bad cold decided must COVID-19. Thank you.

Guessing thing happen Texas lifted statewide mandate. people getting vaccines infections dropping. Seriously, person talking about? H1N1 never went away. Slight correction. risk. low risk. Forgot last tally dead kids covid. think thousand. great, terrible. Ofc will, give anti-mask-anti-vaxxer excuses refuse wear mask. people wanna get vaccine already gotten vaccines. hand refuse get vaccine wear mask deserve real taste virus Yeah, really weird look European. We're probably going catch couple weeks terms vaccinations, still finished removing restrictions. see indoor masks dropped medium term. vaccines used India efficient J&amp;J? Good thing experts clear us definitely didn‚Äôt say ‚Äúno one wear masks‚Äù. 

They said people fully vaccinated don‚Äôt. Mask mandates already largerly honor system businesses enforce them.  Well like they'll suddenly start lying simply mask rules change. unvaccinated people wearing masks, continue wearing masks. mean, person cared far, start now? 

I frequently wonder reads kinds articles surprised Captain Obvious' findings. article says CDC recommends masks poorly ventilated public spaces. 

The media creating headlines clicks, still asked wear masks poorly ventilated public spaces. like outside vaccinated, probably wear mask. situation, wear mask. 

Unfortunately since everyone reads headlines nowadays, non-believers stop masking situations. problem CDC's messaging, intent. PR team still realize say 'you stop wearing mask unless XYZ situations' media turn 'you stop wearing masks!' non-vaccinated people stop wearing masks, one say anything. Drives nuts incompetent CDC is. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

They‚Äôve got brain baby they‚Äôre toddler sized real damage. Lol, opinion may matter much grand scheme things, certainly express question decisions leadership.  Source? Thank you! don‚Äôt know many times I‚Äôve thought quote dealing maskholes. 12-15 year olds became eligible last week. like 60 million smaller kids walking around completely vulnerable. 

For people like ‚Äúwho cares, let‚Äôs roll dice ‚Äòem‚Äù really research downstream/longterm ailments associated kinds viruses. 

But cares, they‚Äôll grownups guess we‚Äôve already established disposable. Oh yeah remember guy. super far live, knew people knew Yes. Middle aged white men especially wearing masks stores specifically say wear mask. cdc fails note necessarily children still vulnerable. Plus confusion real. believe today lowest daily total since late March 2020 keep kid inside. don‚Äôt know tell you. Unvaccinated people running around this. Men lie, women lie, numbers don‚Äôt lie Yeah, thing happening Seychelles Maldives- Sinopharm may good enough prevent hospitalizations deaths, often enough reduce transmission allow reopening without significant outbreak cases. hear lot Canada well US? Surprising states still haven‚Äôt got shit together. live, anyone walk pharmacy get it, flu shot. experts say they‚Äôll lie lol   One dose gives sizable protection 2 weeks. partially vaccinated using mask, minimal risk even others unmasked dont direct link CDC website: almost 50% population least 1 dose projected 33% population previously infected. Even overlap half people cant transmit virus would really hard another wave happen. pools life vests, cars seatbelts, covid masks, wear mask  lost family virus, friends irrevocably harmed it. Family friends psychologically scared medical field responding virus US hundreds thousands already dead US. Millions need long term healthcare surviving it. Outside US it‚Äôs still horror show. virus still evolving shot vaccinating everyone. Morons refuse threats rest us took every precaution could. First world countries lucked getting vaccines first refuse puts everyone risk. virus still real chance evolving become immune vaccines created still become deadly already is. literal race time, intense approaches justifiable necessary.  12 now, kids age almost zero risk anyway. Yes mean go constitutional dick. Personally don‚Äôt really care gov asks wear mask weeks. doesn‚Äôt really effect think it‚Äôll help out. numbers MATTER....the death rates. signs mask requirements don‚Äôt d*ck. people would *did* ignore them. vaccinated age groups yet. make sense removing masks. Yeah, think people thinking whole thing wrong. They‚Äôve told 16 months need avoid virus costs, now, keeping infections low way lower curve. Now, vaccines begun job. idea infection big deal anymore completely foreign unexpected people. It‚Äôs we‚Äôre yet point don‚Äôt worry. may allow spread public places, even vaccinated people become infected (but much less likely become sick die), meaning chances mutation. Home UW Madison. High correlation smart residents vaccination rate. Yeah ...have co-worker sure got Covid already someone church (which family kept going to). Wasn‚Äôt tested claimed worse cold. Also won‚Äôt get vaccinated. 

We‚Äôre still working home wondering we‚Äôll return work we‚Äôll required proof vaccination come back office. Though talk may jobs, mine (IT admin) continue mostly work home.  

Either way I‚Äôm glad works end row. Though may continue wear mask flu season. like got sick past year. (Makes getting flu twice winter 2019, even flu vaccination) sure hope authorize it. may emergency someone doesn‚Äôt unvaccinated kids, virus still new, one say lasting side effects may younger children. aren‚Äôt initially super sick, doesn‚Äôt mean won‚Äôt latent effects complications. I‚Äôd rather vaccinate find bet bad. there‚Äôs many MIS-C see cardiologists knows long. number died - I‚Äôm sick people want brush like ‚ÄúiTs FeW‚Äù ‚ÄúEvErYtHiNg rIsKs‚Äù - like, gfy. Uh huh, like 50 heads closet, hoarding brains?? one going ask. did, I‚Äôll tell truth, it‚Äôs like they‚Äôre going enforce mask mandates. haven‚Äôt far. 3% adult population US immunocompromised vaccine partially completely ineffective

This include allergic. kids. straight lie. got vaccine soon humanly possible get second shot 5/7. lie, that's good sign good argument. figured since got vaccine what‚Äôs point anymore Thank you! Same. never even heard precaution. Honestly I‚Äôm discouraged stupid people, actively work logic known science, don‚Äôt even know bothering me. fucking it.

Go merry covid way. fools refuse vaccine unmask problems solved - social inequity, climate change, gun violence, women‚Äôs rights, civil rights, human rights, animal rights - it‚Äôs always idiots side argument.

So go ahead. Ignore science. stupid. Endanger children friends children vulnerable community. Prove point gravestones.

You‚Äôre fucking exhausting stupid even handle. wish virus could target ignorance. guess close enough.


Be unwell- choice. maniacs. Well aren‚Äôt scientist CDC. cares think bottom line. Well bother look actual death rates?

Florida's death rate national average, that's spite one oldest populations country, open since July. 

I live South Florida, bars open since July, absolutely packed since Thanksgiving. People like get it. We've almost back normal SIX MONTHS, places like MI NY still locked down. Maybe instead bashing FL wrong, maybe take look allowed reopen massive increases deaths compared similar states. 

Deaths/million

* FL - 1680
* NY - 2737
* NJ - 2923
* MI - week would immunity already, total also zero disputing fact vaccine works. disputing fact republicans use cudgel get vaccinated causing us never get heard immunity lie say did. one inevitably creates variant immune vaccine causing us start bullshit again. really think someone hasn‚Äôt vaccinated partially vaccinated walks walmart sees hardly anybody mask would also wear mask?

Yeah do. Alternatively really care already socialize people?

Being pretty condescending person talking favor look percent fully vaccinated people compare many don‚Äôt wear masks inside businesses could easily see number vaccinated people far less.

Almost 40% US population fully vaccinated. half first dose. Another tens millions natural immunity prior infection. Covid downswing large agree risk vaccinated people lower know far many unvaccinated people.

If unvaccinated person wearing mask you. Tough luck. age 14 access vaccine month. small case people cannot get vaccine. need careful. taking precautions several papers show one dose needed previously infected people. doesn‚Äôt CDC consider these? Anybody followed cdc since pandemic started understands inconsistent.

I going follow CDC random people professional background immunology, virology, pandemic response, even healthcare. We‚Äôll see honorable are‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  Let great leftification begin, god's blessing shot fired (except mass shooters) (and cops) Uh doy mention price gouging taking place wood cremate. read places charging 3x‚Äôs normal price. poor family family spent medical care doesn‚Äôt many options. It‚Äôs sad. True. stores establishments mask requirements, dropped based CDC new guidance. Anti maskers *had* wear masks places. get away without wearing anywhere. It‚Äôs cute, isn‚Äôt it?  even trust us one package TP per customer. Y'all Uncle's Wife daughter's best friend Karen's Brother help checkout second roll. too. saw Reddit 3 days ago now. won‚Äôt wear simple mask save people‚Äôs lives expected lie getting vaccinated? LOL Again, trying convince anything. excuses you‚Äôre coming coming mind, mine. need feel safe I‚Äôll need also. Brace selfs, worst yet come.  60% adults received least one dose. And, probably another 12%-15% infection yet received vaccine.

So, getting close 75% adults US soon protection Covid. shit  hurt lying? are. indoors protection virus. unvaccinated continue give Covid other. makes worse! Kids sacrificed huge part even though really effected much all. Adults willing Sacrifice anything (even though vacinated really effected much coronavirus) missed key word thing Like I‚Äôm sitting bar mask hours

They already allowed without one.   Yeah, wonder kind facility actually work in. say they're even working patients knows. Please keep us updated! could argue that, it‚Äôs much counterproductive put much attention non-problem bigger problem many people unnecessarily hesitant get vaccinated. experts referring to, specifically? know do, source using ‚Äúmost‚Äù. 

Most disagreement seems come fact people lie rather saying CDCs information right/wrong. Whoa. bad ass. Way stick man! Racist.  foresee vaccines 3 year old ? Duh?  Probably good time get shots getting TDAP 28 weeks. Ah I‚Äôve defeated facts logic. Tip fedora you, good sir. ‚ÄîPS narwhal bacons midnight :0) Exactly fear. adult friends long hauler covid lung issues year later. want risk kid ending lifelong issues. I'd crawl broken glass spare kid pain. hermit several months inconvenient, something I'll heartbeat keep getting can. Don‚Äôt find cdc‚Äôs willful deception unethical? doesn‚Äôt matter dude. control group study worse masks much. would still 95% effective. That‚Äôs whole point control group haha  like 6000 cases 100,000,000 vaccinated. That's 100%, 99.94% Small Pox pre-facebook None unless got first dose anaphylactic reaction extremely rare 99% people able get it. I'd thought seems slightly better 87% positive, likely increase peers get them. Vaccine hesitancy reduced age groups got 1 8 (13%) adults aged 16 29 years reported vaccine hesitancy, highest age groups

I also think 16-19 mostly FT education generally take vaccine distributed schools Aaand winner... Covid19! sure hope many questions, would expect committee like takes data available reviews requirements emergency authorization. 

No problem due diligence part. unanimous vote speaks end though. Time tell, hope little one get soon enough. PA 54% least one dose. New cases dropped like rock. bad. UK variant much dangerous younger people including kids. Every decision maker involved fully vaccinated months convinced *they* safe. told public get vaccinated idiots want play Covid roulette past caring. Kids immunocompromised damned.

I know exactly going play out. press go overdrive finding people breakthrough infections wind hospital die. child die single mom without childcare claim kid caught grocery store. Fauci Walensky getting grilled every Sunday morning TV. cases start increasing whole thing blow Biden's face. science *did say* keep masking bit post vaccination help protect possible variants may emerge‚Äî must especially watch mutations spike protein bc would definitely render mRNA vax ineffective (until reach herd immunity). 

That said, I‚Äôll probably ‚Äúconservative‚Äù keep wearing mask while. don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs harm that. plan continuing wear masks planes long run prevent getting sick respiratory illnesses (flu, etc). vaccinated, worried that? Honestly asking. effectiveness vaccines high claim, significantly low chance infected almost chance hospitalized whatsoever. someone explain? Thanks! Researchers measured quantity type antibody produced natural vaccine-induced immunity covid-19.

The vaccine really good making antibodies key feature Coronavirus virus, spike protein. would compare unicorn, unicorns unique feature spiral horn. like teaching immune system go horse shaped animals spiral horns, description unique really well targeted find teach immune system correct""bad guy"" . also helpful hopefully protecting variants concern may even exist yet bc coronavirus unique spike protein vaccine targeted towards.

You right vaccines illnesses confer better immunity infection disease, Coronavirus protection better vaccine.

Plus studying generation memory b cells development Corona virus vaccines, Corona virus vaccines good too.

The development Memory b cells like body's long term memory pathogens. memory B cells pathogen, body make good defensive response super fast. game thrones, human memory b cells white walkers, would prepared defeat right away instead accidentally stumbling upon weaknesses. Glad hear that! don‚Äôt need wait month. look happened places, time year viruses spread easily. daft believe better information models CDC? also heard black bears black.  Heart disease contagious. Diabetes contagious. hate analogy. It‚Äôs judgment call. simple equation vaccine readily available anyone wants enough people getting like should. haven‚Äôt got vaccine motivate get it. There‚Äôs helping people refuse get vaccine, there‚Äôs nothing now. nah bro. americans known honest Hell no. got vaccine punished actions others. Forcing people keep wearing masks punishes everyone, didn‚Äôt get vaccine. way see it, I‚Äôm vaccinated don‚Äôt worry getting virus anyone isn‚Äôt. people unvaccinated want risk getting disease feel free. continue wear mask though. think wait pediatric vaccine? Seems silly considering low likelihood severe symptoms among kids. 

CDC, group people that

* Told us nothing worry pandemic hit Asian countries hard.

* Recommend wearing masks, went far saying harmful (walked back said want healthcare workers enough PPE), best white lie.

* Told us confidently covid airborne (of course is).

* rep Rachel TV asked affects children people goin unmasked, answer concerns parents making decision kids. Another is, allow people large enough amount get vaccinated, covid still roam produce variants, could lead one vaccine isnt effective against. likely obvious eradication possible since last fall. virus high infectivity factor virus reached nearly every county community spread. think Trump wrong try pushing country accept tens/hundreds thousands deaths order hasten marathon herd immunity, likely based thinking eradication impossible society like America barring draconian mitigation measures.  Friends (GQP) mentioned they'll finally get plates renewed finally go again. Got called asshole mentioned they're hypocrites ""Mexicans lying"", willing themselves. spent year trying get everyone wear mask developed vaccines way better masks. We're gonna okay. CA higher % shots given, covid lower there. acre long term effects people getting sick willingly choosing get shot. Fuck em.

&amp;#x200B;

Florida blocked cities counties enforcing mask mandates, companies free lose business wanted to. Disney sick losing business. True, amount spread anywhere increases risk. think avoid attitude disease spread anyone, anywhere going problem people care. vaccinated protected vaccinated choosing whatever level risk comfortable with.

What's problem ? new vaccine rules rely Americans honest. assumption people lie, waited certain percentage vaccinated hope enough honest matter. We, diabetics, 36% higher risk requiring hospitalisation contract Covid Vs non diabetic.

I'm surprised low. There's literally higher risk male diabetes then. state also pretty high like 40% fully vaccinated another 6% first dose. high somewhere like Cali still pretty close stage Israel reached irreversible plummet. 

Hopefully incentive plus opening ages 12-15 helps us shoot little Hey people honest, I‚Äôve vaccine shots *quickly darts eyes around room advice directed local governments businesses. directed individuals.

The CDC felt science showed people fully vaccinated unlikely get seriously ill covid spread covid.

So, told people vaccinated strong medical benefit wearing mask social distancing.

That instruction local governments stores lift mask mandates try differentiate people vaccinated people unvaccinated. taken such. One thing frustrating past 16 months however long sub, we‚Äôve sat complained anti maskers anti vaxxers. We‚Äôve ALWAYS known people existed throughout pandemic. news comes out, lot people acting like people following rules along we‚Äôve opened floodgates. acknowledge anti maskers existed among us we‚Äôre pretending it‚Äôs new wave cicadas emerge? It‚Äôs old story, it‚Äôs good news vaxxers/maskers. Water wet particle transmitted? don‚Äôt float air travel around. sneeze someone covid exposed. sneeze mask fluid would expose someone caught mask. I‚Äôm sure explained repeatedly. Anti mask dumb thing especially someone else impact shit Listen CDC perfect science clear here. Vaccinated people highly unlikely spread COVID, Anthony Fauci said himself. Therefore Vaccinated people allowed shed masks feel confortable so. see reason fully vaccinated people shamed wearing masks forever. Following science best way get us pandemic see reason stop believing science now. makes sense summer disease spreads slowly hospitals manage loads, rather large population without immunity winter comes around. I've decided wear mask kids vaccine. I'm wondering guide line people expecting. Someone replied that's high risk wear mask, I'd like see CDC MD's say.  Plenty immunocompromised people (dare say most?) vaccinated without issue. is, understanding, concern evidence certain medications may reduce efficacy vaccine subset population stuck reduced efficacy less two evils. Here's Venn diagram people wear masks people get vaccinated:

O least waited first day bring pet rather show interview! You‚Äôre plain ignorant wearing mask running biking People literally don‚Äôt want pandemic end. pathetic. I'm one them, please lump them.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* really hope new guidelines rolled believe public lie vaccine status mask needed‚Ä¶ spend life protect anti-vaxxers take 3 minutes protect themselves? news, experts named captain obvious understand right would like chickenpox, herpes, HIV? already one (no prizes guessing which) life goes on, guess means could flare-ups road pretty much everyone going get would hope medication even prevent so. What? way... article hard hitting news since news water wet.  YO DEFINITELY GUNNA LIE   discussion intelligence. 80% people believe TV says. TV says masks needed, people aren;t gonna wear anymore. paranoid, wear one means- long want to. society moving without you. almost thing said me, word word.  Would buy Gatorade. Also lost taste - luckily couple days - found baked potatoes pretty ideal keep fed  yeah always knew 100% total immunity idk what's considered big deal bad cases slip through.   100% kids get hit trains die. Almost 100% kids get virus live, that, don‚Äôt even symptoms. 

So pretty bad analogy.   enforceable? feel like hits weird grey area need stop division keep mask mandate. anti maskers won‚Äôt reason wear mask ones choose wear mask vaccinated won‚Äôt scorned aren‚Äôt vaccinated. Wearing mask like scarlet letter judgement people assume person isn‚Äôt vaccinated. Division stop. 

But see CDC playing chess checkers. Awarding got vaccinated punishing aren‚Äôt ‚Äúextremely inconvenient‚Äù miles apart. can‚Äôt imagine scenario temporarily covering nose mouth thin piece paper ‚Äúextremely inconvenient‚Äù especially 14 months. Masks cheap ans ubiquitous. places give one forgot bring one.


True mostly capture idea behind statement. sizeable amount people think might missing perspective.

Take example someone late 20‚Äôs, single, working home. plenty go entire pandemic alone. able see family. able see friends. Unable even search romance. would find masking extremely inconvenient extremely lonely. Whether like admit humans base lot attraction around aesthetics covering face akin removing large part first process courting species. Throw fact maintain social distance households gets difficult make friends let alone ask someone out. 

Can see Masks inconvenient type scenario? others like that. Masks contentious discussion it‚Äôs easy ‚Äúmasking easy/masking N95 12 hours straight? that‚Äôs inconvenient.

Amen that. hated N95s I‚Äôm worried diseases Covid wearing one those. Everyone city must gotten vaccinated. mask sight! Considering 37% entire state gotten vaccinated...the odds city pretty weird...... 70% vaccinated+natural immunity may needed. Around half country vaccinated now, people still dying start July 2020, despite natural immunity also existing.

Experts know exact threshold virus relatively new.  county Health Department still enforcing masks. change despite CDC says Government official here, trust government.... forced voluntarily trusting. Simple :)   Fine I‚Äôm expert, even American know lie. Still waiting vaccine get I'll still wearing mask last person vaccinated.

To honest, I'd love masks remain post COVID capacity like Japan. ill public, considered common courtesy wear mask. agree you. Unchecked spread bad entire world, including us vaccinated. Easing mask recommendations doesn‚Äôt address problem, embolden antivaxxers/antimaskers. 

Mostly cost, little benefit. listen CDC. person won‚Äôt hurt lie vaccinated. risk spreading others aren‚Äôt vaccinated including children people able vaccinated. doesn‚Äôt matter it‚Äôs easy get shot people won‚Äôt get due political beliefs. news sky blue water wet missed passage CDC guidelines told avoid unmasked unvaccinated people.

Could link me? even read linked?

I think commenting need ""expert"" figure out? Nice. deserve it. We've made end game. us vaccinated, normal life resume, and, quite frankly, love it! I'm gonna keep wearing mine 12 kid get vaxxed. I'd feel like dick make wear one went somewhere. hassle ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Can‚Äôt make people show card receive getting vaccine? Me, friends family Right leaning. wore masks, got vaccinated, hell even contracted Covid. Never issue it. don‚Äôt really care people want not, wear masks not.

But live lot Democratic folk don‚Äôt wear masks again, don‚Äôt care. really bother much somebody else wears mask? triggering? information studies come last weeks lead change? Seems information months. rarity reinfection early recovered persons, would think another protection going apart antibodies. early, recently shared maskless 45 minute lunch someone tested positive 2 days later. would think would gotten sick immune. really need find preventing people getting covid antibodies present. know may better understanding need boosters. course they‚Äôll lie. People lying essential workers soon vaccine released way could gotten shots than. course Karens, Republicans, trump/Putin lovers lie it.  shows willing lie think greater good. organization would put whole lot trust in.  wrong edited headline. article legit actual headline says ""***The C.D.C. director offers stark reassurance: unvaccinated people risk unmasking.***""

which evidently true : vaccinated spread get it. unvaccinated spread get it. can‚Äôt add 33% 60%. 

You assume vaccinated people also infected.

For back napkin calculations (like above), assume 33% vaccinated unvaccinated groups infected.

So need multiply 40% (unvaccinated population) .33 find number unvaccinated people infected. 

40% * .33 = 13.2% 

So addition 60% adult population vaccine acquired immunity, ~13% adult population haven‚Äôt vaccinated, antibodies infection. Damn Right! It‚Äôs none governments business health status is! Ever hear HIPPA? Anyone info regarding huge jump reported doses New Hampshire? CDC says 99.9% adults elderly least one dose. would awesome seems like reporting error. friends retail get vaccinated. vaccinated, concerned others do. still should, reason vaccinated measles half-dozen diseases. flu vaccine every year.   Experts say? think expert autocorrected everyone.  you. another really think ending mask rules trusting americans right thing, all. think assuming anti mask/anti vaxers right thing, forcing vaccine hesitant hurry get vaxed basically accelerating herd immunity among everyone ever get vaxed. risky move point... sigh. really know else could do, keep waiting something end that's never going to. 

Source: It‚Äôs even they‚Äôre afraid, (which are), it‚Äôs fact don‚Äôt social life begin least liars likely get it. Fuck ‚Äòem! It‚Äôs choice. no, every single state, able get vaccines general populace was. people could get first essential workers worked within medical field. She‚Äôs really good answering question wished asked, rather answering actual question. Wait... Boiling water smell? thought good sniffer  Influenza isn‚Äôt spread aerosol, lower r0 SARS-Cov-2. Influenza doesn‚Äôt cause long term organ damage, either. One perk abundantly cautious last winter virtually influenza. Turns masks really helpful preventing spread respiratory pathogens.

How get longer pandemic everything prevent community spread? I‚Äôm genuinely baffled this.

You‚Äôre correct probably make new RNA vaccine rather quickly one variants achieves immune escape. BUT: case, would susceptible reinfection new vaccine deployed.

And finally, largest nursing union US disagrees CDC. I‚Äôm Ok, I'm nurse. Let explain think take. record, personally ready ditch mask begin going I've vaccinated since January.

Fully vaccinated people minimal risk severe Covid, MANY nurses recognizing this. worry unvaccinated people. Many unvaccinated people may lie vaccine status. concern still near vaccination rates herd immunity, means shit ton people still risk, means shit ton potential patients hospital beds. even send patient Covid unit higher level care beds. Given slammed many us were, many us reuse N95s weeks, many us PPE ALL, CDC also said freaking BANDANAS acceptable protection... can't blame them. wanna again, we've burned people. OSHA, Joint Commission everyone shown care safety patient safety, really.

So, perspective. respect, ""tHiS ThEy'Re dOcToRs"" comments gross.  Currently ineligible factor. Everyone get vaccines. one‚Äôs inherently unable to. That‚Äôs point. ""We usually wear masks occasionally eat restaurants"" - People know got covid going complete shitshow. many America think COVID-19 hoax excuse wear mask.  Well duh...people assholes. White guy USAF vet checking in. trust government. antivaxxers culled herd. they‚Äôre crowd always preaches ‚Äúnatural selection‚Äù. natural selection. Stay Reddit want avoid negative news AZ jab you.

Selfish, entitled idiots. #Did need ""experts"" know that? problem would much worse rich countries focus production new vaccines targeting variants. good, we're great shape!  unchecked spread happening largely communities least likely following guidelines anyways. risk already exists continue exist regardless guidelines. somehow change next months even years? It‚Äôs like anti-maskers also anti-vaskers protect anti-vaxxers? let protect themselves? can't spare 3 minutes walk CVS I'm wearing mask benefit another year. many, many users subreddit serious problem projection

Speaking myself, projecting *before* covid, back assumed people tried right thing like try to. last fourteen months provided hard, unforgettable evidence nasty, selfish, amoral *many* people are.   STEFON That's missing vaccine DONT NEED CARE PEOPLE'S VACCINE STATUS!!!!!
Because got vax protected, cares people wear mask around you, fine anyway. FFS, people losing minds non-issue days. Where's favorite statistics comment? ‚òπ Sure, still catch covid shot. matter wont get sick. So, would give shit get it? government knows this. 

&amp;#x200B;

It matter unvaccianted guy lies shot refuses wear mask, gives wont get sick. give shit im infected wont experience symptoms. bothers another person tells put body.

If want get vaccinated, abortion, shoot heroin stick freaking pinecone ass anyone's business long I'm hurting another person.

Now could make argument getting vaccinated covid putting people risk, certain extent is. took care issue.

Average death covid patient, average death someone US without covid. 78% admitted covid patients overweight, 90% vitamin deficient. alarming amount diabetes consume sugar suppose to. right put body want, mine too. I'm vaccinated everything else problem taking vaccine necessary. healthy prevent dying polio hepatitis, vaccine will. prevent dying covid. take care myself, already went covid. forced wear mask mask restrictions lifted. wear one? Sure I'm fine that, I've whole time without complaint. restrictions lifted lifted all. thought replying ‚Äúhow tell someone lying vaccination‚Äù joke trending couple days ago posted three posts yours. weren‚Äôt.

Man opposite me! keep smiling people make eye-contact say ""sorry"", ""thank you"" need move, realize see smile ~~think I'm~~ *don't know I'm not* completely emotion-less come here...what matter happens one cares guess

I idea pull conclusion what's said. vaccinated person maskless, pose greater risk someone wearing mask. Please stop narrative us choose resume lives vaccinated somehow harming around us. We're not.

The entitlement last line amazing. think rest us year? I've feeding instacart Shipt. I've going grocery stores 6AM 10PM. No, take decision way saying believe vaccines *basically* prevent spread. 

Maybe need new authority charge PSA campaigns messaging, idk. doctor? I‚Äôd go doctor. Could hit nerve needle.  absolutely restrictive time life someone near 40. Parks closed.

Lmao people delusional. Also love vaccine fanaticism, literally felt need put Reddit tag. Jesus man, actually feel bad.. life clearly purpose. i‚Äôm Due mostly sharpestüòÇ  I'm going continue wearing masks flights, that's really I'm going wear masks going forward.

It‚Äôs sad anxious, maladjusted agoraphobes won‚Äôt justified weirdness anymore... fully vaccinated option keep mask not. back important thing: convince Americans get vaccinated. almost yet.

get vaccinated people, please. fast can

the vaccines work like magic grocery store? can‚Äôt ask people continue wear mask grocery store? worked one teenager, swear God every type person world offer goes grocery store. Ya kinda feed yourself, ya know? I‚Äôm absolutely asking go concert restaurant. take consideration elderly sick (trader joes one many stores lifted mask requirement effective immediately) lack compassion consideration. I‚Äôm asking hold anyone, let alone entire country. say **no** considerations made places **essential** life bullshit. It‚Äôs mask. You‚Äôll store half hour. You‚Äôll ok.

But larger even, stupidity may biggest threat humanity ever faced planet.

I starting realize can't save people hell-bent saved. Worse, take many them, e.g. hospitals overwhelmed even people careful access quality healthcare taken away people could taken vaccine, simply chose - yet choose occupy hospital bed, easily-preventable disease progressed further. thus aiding spread creation additional variants. Worse yet, reports nurses (in USA iirc?) refusing take also, large number patients shrinking staff may overwhelm hospitals, next winter.

Gee, I'm ray sunshine today I? trying see clearly, way mess. like covid virus itself, misinformation similarly spreads virally, governments get easily overwhelmed due lacking proper defense (education). due democracy, people misinformed leads almost autoimmune like behaviors, USA capitol riots (trying right wrongs, attacking ones' government), well paralyzation (gridlock) causes destructive behaviors. almost like Russian-backed anti-vaccination Information, actually cares comes from, Facebook click bait influencers whatever - attacking body government, lacking defenses, misinformation ""infection"" running its' course unabated.

Taiwanese want get vaccinated vaccines killing sickening people covid. good regardless 16 states data reported sunday I'm still blown away percent 65+ year olds gotten vaccine. seems obvious get it, getting 85% american demographic page anything always seemed like far fetched dream. get that.  find strange people worried long term side effects vaccine worried long term side effects Covid. don‚Äôt think expect seems happen enough way likely. 

I‚Äôm late 30s crap ton friends age Covid (most ok course) 1 really bad fatigue issues week long stretch month (for 5 months now), 3 smell issues months later (2 smell burning odors evening, one smells sickly sweet odor sometimes nothing days), one thinks everything tastes like shit it‚Äôs year (he‚Äôs pretty much stopped going restaurants point). 

I don‚Äôt really think expect happen get Covid seems like pretty annoying consequence. life can‚Äôt get mind around long term concern damage vaccine. 

I get newer technology delving actual process seems spike protein produced body one way another.  Either Covid attached bind shit ton cells replicate billion times dead end attached anything chopped discarded gusto immune system primed first shot. situation different last time.  Great points. phrases ‚Äútrust science‚Äù ‚Äúthe science says‚Äù keep getting thrown around. Science doesn‚Äôt *say* anything. ‚ÄúScience‚Äù process gathering data interpret. interpretations made fallible people biased pressured push agenda. CDC, show us ‚Äúscience‚Äù, opinions. genuinely fascinating tell more. went vape going material religion less one reply. Alright I‚Äôm else got? think you‚Äôre something brilliant here. isn‚Äôt attitude ‚ÄúI got vaccine, screw rest‚Äù attitude ‚Äúif people afraid, let take precautions...don‚Äôt force to‚Äù It‚Äôs late. guidance already issued. EVERYONE hard 16 months. Everyone. lost mother due Covid-19. Life sucked big donkey sacks. Two weeks? 4 weeks? matter vaccines work? Protect children... cat bag going make due. Either CDC organization listen isn‚Äôt. Everything could possibly need know came first months pandemic suppressed. called lies conspiracy theories proved correct including fact transmission airborne. kept wondering massive disinformation campaign launched. Scotia¬†and¬†Newfoundland Labrador¬†have joined ranks provinces longer offering Oxford-AstraZeneca¬†COVID-19¬†vaccine first doses growing concerns¬†over shot‚Äôs link rare potentially deadly blood clots.
Health officials across country scrambling deal reports severe blood clots, blamed vaccine, new data suggest risk side effect high one 55,000 Canada, opposed original estimates one moves stop administering AstraZeneca, first announced by¬†Alberta¬†and¬†Ontario¬†this week, left hundreds thousands Canadians received shot limbo, officials consider whether use vaccine different one second doses. humor - misinformation. Nothing wrong humour factually correct. comment wasn't. anti-vaxxers anti-maskers normal stuff they‚Äôre missing hard. They‚Äôre risking getting infected spreading virus. SK already said everything open Aug 2.

Canada taking approach CDC taking - keep people focused ball.

Hell - UK *just* allowed 6 people gatherings ~6 weeks ahead us.  Except that's really it. They're saying immune compromised people like organ transplant recipients would safer higher percentage completely vaccinated. true certain extent. 

However, past threshold vaccines start significantly reduce transmission. high risk still wear masks, monoclonal treatments provided free government high risk groups.

The main problem people know visualize risk determine acceptable levels. truth care political spectrum are.  told healthy population wait opened back able actually get protected.

That's fucked I'm sorry give shit see it.

This lied get vaccine family vaccine knew selfish fucked country learned year selfish, too. Thankfully, children get COVID minuscule probability hospitalization death. 287 recorded COVID deaths children 18 United States! Since start COVID-19 outbreak, 30x many children died traffic fatalities COVID. One blessings ignore, pursue truth science statistics, children high risk.

If willing put 11 year old car, statistically sensible reason shouldn‚Äôt willing bring grocery store point time. point even statistically true younger child (as babies even less susceptible severe COVID reactions even susceptible traffic fatalities). country people fully vaccinated, still need wear masks indoors. people don‚Äôt abide rule places personally, feel safer. Usually get sick often past year I‚Äôve healthier ever!! Masks work people MASK NEXT 30 YEARS!!! normal face pretty mean looking face. feel this. 

All adult life people told ""when first met you, thought bitch."" Pretty much solely based resting facial expression.

I heard past year. Yeah, let's ignore science live fear Yes pretty much expectation also. like ""turd immunity"" name. entirely possible we've 25% Americans infected, depending whose estimates follow. also get 70-80% vaccinated, really comes much overlap two groups, think there's less overlap couple random samples would have. general, longer time frame actually result higher effectiveness. Exact timing differ depending vaccine, e.g. AstraZeneca benefitting particularly increased time span.

Not wait extra that, still want full protection soon possible. 12-16 weeks doses seems fine (likely even beneficial) (Western) vaccines. Yeah, wonder much would‚Äôve helped announce benchmark. even hey average reaches x well unmask, hey we‚Äôre feelin good two weeks we‚Äôre gonna transition tomorrow masks. Would‚Äôve helped smooth transition lot. people ignore CDC's recommendation remove mask vaccinated continue put people risk selfish. Sounds good me. Hopefully eventually countries around world move towards vaccinations general tbh. would take basically one generation growing normal would kill lot anti-vaxx sentiment. Yup closed throughout summer. Yet people still wanna selfish. Even worse CDC seems caved too. I‚Äôm still leaving house unmasked many months yet. Still risky even mask. It‚Äôs share bases Koreans. I‚Äôm actually surprised aren‚Äôt already. made available Korean civilians working bases immediately. absolute safest thing anyone stay locked inside 24/7 entire life. walking outside endanger yourself. life striking balance risk reward. Safety vs. satisfaction. think that's inaccurate. Even crappy mask prevent transmission. better masks kn95, kf94 even surgical mask would prevent getting common colds flus. Especially considering virus size much larger sars-cov-2.  Yes true. agree too.

I got flu two years now. covid, always get sick Christmas New Years. (going celebrations get sick) surprising # counties hovering 40-50 percent 65yr olds older. sure county may population dense sad thing It‚Äôs frustrating. Government pandemic - 

""We're banning things harmful health, like alcohol. What, save life, stop complaining!"" aware completely spin way too? Like pro-mask people would say ""listen CDC!"" CDC advocating masks saying ""don't listen CDC!"" CDC giving directives agree with. generally want use power government force wear one too. don‚Äôt care people want wear masks 24/7, types wear masks home quarantine kids rest family test positive aren‚Äôt types take live let live attitude. Could also low symptoms hospital reasons    would happen take inactivated virus vaccine (sinovac) mRNA vaccine (moderna/pfeizer)? Thanks sharing!  Sorry got notification. basically diverse like New York concrete jungle; laid back like Cali main language dutch. brother/sisters back home never seen snow. mainly speak dutch also speak Sranang Tongo (Surinamese Tongue) I'd say best part trees coconuts. colorful/tropical. kid, family would go swim river eat fresh coconut guy bashing open. 

Fun fact: Back dutch swapped New York Suriname sugar plantations. I'm Javanese Indonesian; ancestors Indonesia taken work plantations many moons ago; causing relatives Indonesia, Netherlands, Holland, course Suriname. Children risk seasonal influenza COVID everyone behave accordingly without monster.

Reference: "" ""Young children higher risk severe illness flu. put perspective, unvaccinated kids risk fully vaccinated Grandma. It‚Äôs acceptable risk point parents dependable childcare transportation, go get errands done one watch children? take public transportation? don‚Äôt local supermarkets curbside pickup? Can, risk certainly lower unvaccinated parents (or anyone else house). Yeah learned lot that‚Äôs fauci said said early 2020. concerned shortage ppe hcw‚Äôs. already record since know interview, you‚Äôll also remember talk said risk wearing masks general population use.  I'm 100% convinced pandemic really yet. lot variants circulating, knows new variant emerge vaccine effective against.

Wearing mask small ask. continue daily numbers much lower now. Funny London based journalist uses word jab, common word UK... weird that... guess point seems like latest evidence vaccinated people unlikely spread virus. easier get child wear mask though model normalize it. pointing probable reason many parents quite ready go mask-free public yet. don‚Äôt care! Let get irresponsibility. Even it‚Äôs 10x higher know of, that‚Äôs still 0.01%, 100x 0.1%, matter slice still rare event. Doesn‚Äôt matter. CDC said it‚Äôs safe vaccinated people around unvaccinated people without masks close proximity. you‚Äôre unvaccinated want take risk, that‚Äôs life. mine. kids, COVID literally less deadly flu. They‚Äôll fine. approach well - specifically anti-vaxxers, happily stop masking. really give rat's behind people think lunatic, honestly... believe anything coming Texas guy's mouth. wonder maybe they're gaming anti-vaxxers try hit herd immunity. theory, hear out. They're saying safe people fully vaccinated go without masks, evidence points true. know give cover obstinate folks get vaccinated matter take masks also. turn create greater spread portion population increase immunity recover. number rise along vaccinated number citizens, hopefully hitting herd immunity. Imagine getting triggered something completely ignorable. I‚Äôm talking immunocompromised also happen allergic vaccine. small proportion. According CDC website, ‚Äúchildren, adolescents, young adults available data outcomes, ... (0.8%) required ICU admission (&lt;0.1%) died. again, conflating idea kids somehow extremely susceptible virus 99.9% survival rate for? I‚Äôm sure similar rates viruses. Save outrage. Yeah husband discussing son‚Äôs pediatrician doesnt know look like without mask Vice versa. don‚Äôt see masks going away doctors offices bit longer it‚Äôs still crazy think  People screaming follow CDC beginning that‚Äôs I‚Äôm going do. Covid going disappear. It‚Äôs stay risk us vaccinated low enough go back living like normal.

I trust cdc current administration give go ahead Im going that. right, guidance issued I'm saying issued two weeks later. kids children protect, feel families debate going bring kids Harris Teeter them. also feel people work Harris Teeter got vaccinated week 4/18 reached full immunity yet, unmasked people coming stores. see harm waiting people waited turn get vaccinated reach full immunity. Hah. automod delete post political, make post less true.  
Regardless, TON people indoctrinated get vaccinated masking, go away long time. Taiwan, like many others, free make bilateral agreements vaccine makers. 

Besides Taiwan trust Shanghai Fosun China actively [blocking Taiwan World Health 

Of course end, China [blocks BioNTech name vaccine  wish case whole pandemic. want accept risk choices. Exactly. one fears life daily basis getting polio reason. Vaccines work, science works. shit ham sandwich Children risk seasonal influenza COVID parents behave accordingly.

Reference: "" ""Young children higher risk severe illness flu.

Also, feel like also forgetting unlikely catching COVID passing contact store - transmission prolonged close contact - jobs, homes, hospitals. Catching COVID passing someone 10 seconds store unlikely. Yep. they‚Äôll say governments plan along get many unvaccinated sick possibly killed lifting mask mandate. Yep, immunocompromised people also huge risk can't get vaccinated That's fair, sympathize. time, seem like weeks would make much difference pragmatically. everyone wants least 1 dose now, besides children. They're getting approved months.

Since 1st-dose rates plateauing, thing we'd waiting 2nd-dose lag catch up. 1st-dose folks partially safe, also likely continue wearing masks per CDC. What's left going vaccinate, unless plan require wear masks forever we're basically finish line.

Hopefully lifting requirement vaccinated people encourage fence start process. hell would anyone arbitrarily? Permanent mask laws? Talk paranoid fantasy Good ! care, that's got vaccinated. can't stop morons morons, though. God knows could would years ago Tea Party thing. 

Stay safe. Ivermectin seemed effective India reducing deaths, although study ...and 9 states reported *zero* children dying covid-19.

Listen science, mother. agree, disagreements people topic. 

For example, UK 35 days COVID restrictions scheduled dropped. 

Yet, outdoor events like Brighton pride scheduled occur August (2 months restrictions removed) cancelled. pointed ridiculousness cancelling outdoor open-air event people able freely go 2000-person nightclubs got downvoted.

I think lot people realise vaccinated population rates COVID quickly fizzle out. 

The recent instances Indian variant UK occurred within unvaccinated young population, August even 18-year-olds first vaccine. even not, cases translate serious illness death, cares. already making even worse already anyone works retail. assholes feel like CDC side even emboldened assholes. 

""Oh, *you're* higher authority CDC!?""

The answer course yes, privately owned company's property, never listened first place Many countries require form proof vaccination (or negative test) travelers, least coming months. It'll airlines check prior departure (just like check make sure valid visa / citizenship). international flights least, proof requirement come less automatically. Still works common cold, flu some, seasonal allergies. Thanks open-minded. Also, realized assuming USA summary, could anywhere else world, that's bad me. article worldwide numbers case anyone curious.

Also worth noting numbers ""flu season"" typically counted winter months (Dec-Feb believe northern hemisphere), include months, normally peaks still worth studying, comparing years time period. Hotels US become awful that. Thank goodness airbnb. Because. 

CDC: People keep wearing masks.

Un vax'd people: CDC wrong lot shit, really gonna listen them?

CDC: Vax'd people stop wearing masks.

Un vax'd people: PARTY!!

Vax'd people: ......

Which one - CDC wrong CDC reliable beacon truth reason? somewhat complicated issue. high risk younger teen able get first shot. see covid still threat kids. know flu also threat kid risk issues. still dangerous get flu get covid, course covid prevalent right likely get flu. require masks keep child safe flu, even middle flu season risk catching flu risk catching covid due pandemic. feel comfortable going shopping without mask unlikely catch incredibly unlikely able pass on, I'm still cautious daughter. question whether government make everyone wear masks indefinitely whether would really make daughter kids safer. think will. never trusted people wear masks around daughter I've seen many people going without masks whole time. changing mask rules encourages people get vaccinated, see could help. trust CDC done statistical analysis know likely make difference overall, continue cautious daughter.   rest awful. get people wore masks pre-COVID wearing them. assume literally, since eyes itchy watery year. go lick handrail drain humanity. Yup. part worked well. Everyone shots could shove opinion ass.

But place medical establishment trusted, better put it.. knew doctors nurses help heal, bureaucratic quagmires nonwithstanding. 

In for-profit healthcare scenario, see trust much harder gain. mask mandate protect community itself. 
 
It absolutely needed, saved lives. agree caring hurts I‚Äôm going pick health theirs.

I know lot people wearing mask lockdown hasn‚Äôt problem, it‚Äôs destroyed mental health. I‚Äôm high school people wearing masks means can‚Äôt read expressions, it‚Äôs hard conversations, can‚Äôt sit next other, there‚Äôs general distance us. feel like I‚Äôve put life hold year, even though I‚Äôve known COVID wouldn‚Äôt really affect family, sake strangers. I‚Äôve happily complied I‚Äôve seen numbers, point I‚Äôm willing much more. I‚Äôve worn mask, quarantined, got vaccinated, I‚Äôm gonna live fear forever sake people chance protect choose to. Social distancing inherently restrictive. may you‚Äôve settled cushy work-at-home job. millennials young, vulnerable Gen Zers face consequences restrictions rest lives. 

Think missed work networking opportunities, deepened education disparities lack socialization (which already bad enough pre-COVID) young people undergone. restricted quality education deeply affect opportunities young people professional quality ones graduate. Even looking back London Blitz, UCL literally unable function war, moved campus Aberystwyth carried normal. 

Masks merely inconvenience, sure. restricting medical students‚Äô ability study optimal conditions, removing architecture students‚Äô ability model lab, unable move geology students field distancing restrictions, unprecedented degrade quality future workers. students, one doesn‚Äôt even need imagine consequences unable train new apprentices workers.

Not claiming open everything restrictions entirely useless. act like social distancing is, most, minor inconvenience insult young people wasted 2% life, provided life expectancy doesn‚Äôt tank skyrocket.  ""Context hard."" can‚Äôt help think even kids eligible vaccine, people arms new mask policies would another argument justify continued mitigation... Surely Covid vaccines mandatory shortly. largely selfish, realistically need direct immediate incentive get getting current efforts get vaccinated.  there‚Äôs still lot holdouts, deal consequences. Setting thresholds become problematic live area state 40% people indifferent assholes nuts won‚Äôt get vaccinated matter what, won‚Äôt wear mask anyway, everyone else left floating well defined

This good way back-track messaging lose credibility threshold fails reached. dealing individuals incentives coordinated group people actively work reach threshold speak of. never said anything 100% effective. 

Also no, n95 masks 100% effective. therein lies irony - go science runs grain opinions. rational, caring, adult thing do. thank good human. acting access thing actually vaccinated? also takes time people go access getting scheduled shot actually getting second shot two weeks full protection. realistically takes 1-2 months able ""access"" vaccine actually reap full benefits. people need protect - personal responsibility. N95 masks readily available protect them. risk always needed take precautions.  Taiwan, like many others, free make bilateral agreements vaccine 

not exclusive rights already purchased, taiwan thinks international law benefit obligation follow international law, futher isolates reality Got data?  freedom choice consume? agree getting vaccinated good choice, remain choice.   That's ridiculous; Chinese assert that, even really believe it.

You need passport visa enter, army. country... wearing mask effect you?

Missed question.  Eh, wierd all, refers forming one single nation many states. sure interpret want to. sure motto would relevant literal laws country though. affects them, sore throat (could virus,or could allergies), throw mask go grocery shopping reducing chance person getting sick.

Its honestly good idea, pandemic not. said, think employees get paid sick days time off. dont think PPE substitute either. could see going ways   I'm anxious wearing mask, definitely see plus side it. mind getting sick viruses people spreading around.

I feeling since humans like huddle together groups we're track 10 billion us end century, either get smarter huddle, become much antisocial. death rate children 0.01%. completely unfounded. Playing Devil's advocate bit here, motivation would get people returning normalcy motivating people go things help economy make people money. truth major threat kids, probably handful serious complications die done kept strict requirements place. 

Now stepping away advocacy...I think lives saved motivating people get vaccinated age groups far risk zero tolerance COVID spread unreasonable goal. People go sun risk developing sun damage skin.


People drink water fluids risk dehydration.


People play Russian roulette fully loaded pistol risk accidentally shoot head.


*Look mom! I'm scientist.* Hope ever drive care...you ""could"" kill someone. rare ""could"" happen.

Better stay home forever safe. 5 years extreme imo, plan keep masking couple months crowded places see new guidelines impact public health. friends happily walking unmasked long we're close others, we're eating restaurants again. internet supply verified proof arguements. I'm tired seeing everyone trying prove point point. you, folks. wear mask really big f\*\*\*en deal honestly. neither kids caught bugs past year we've masked up. call win. Vaccinated think mask key kept us healthy humans, healthy true. infected virus, i.e. mRNA vaccine gives recipe spike protein virus, viral load.

If get infected COVID-19 regardless vaccination status - viral load. less COVID vax.  going happen... That's whole point vaccine... I'm continuing wear masks well. three things looking occur shortly.

The first got J&amp;J, CDC says fully vaccinated 2 weeks, data seems show 8 weeks much protected. I'm 5 1/2 weeks. second last couple weeks anyone wants walk get vaccine. means another month, people want vaccine get fully vaccinated. third cases plummeting, kept rate, would COVID free month. Obviously that's going happen, figure month it'll probably leveled new normal.

Basically, everything I'm seeing points mid-June significantly safer personally communally, stabilizing. Yes, is! Illinois almost 40% two weeks. believe companies noted stores areas local rules continue oblige maybe I‚Äôm mistaken. Either way state could punish feel mandate followed. Unlikely it‚Äôs still liability. knew virus spread. 

Why deliberately obtuse? Clearly masks cause spread COVID-19. absolutely science back claims up. think CDC short-circuited that, better worse. really sure conform conforming rules before. conform taking mask feel uncomfortable yet never wear properly first place? want know draw line thinking hypocrisy giving sides point view subject? democrats giving win rofl. \*nobody that's vaccinated worried. feel worst people can't vaccinate.  That‚Äôs masks important pandemic many people could symptoms contagious.

You lead part  wear N95 mask goggles every time public, literally matter people wearing masks. N95 mask protect **you** **others**; unlike cloth masks, protect **others** **you**.

The mask mandate protect **community** **itself**. Unless it‚Äôs N95, it‚Äôs anything prevent inhaling Covid. masks keep sick people spreading virus coughing exhalation.  ‚ÄúIf vaccinated want take masks, free authority CDC President United States backing you‚Äù

Imagine thinking CDC ‚Äúguidelines‚Äù agreeance POTUS = law.

ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èfail I‚Äôm vaccinated I‚Äôm fine it. I‚Äôm also exceedingly cautious planning continue wear mask enclosed public places least next 3 weeks see there‚Äôs large spike cases. It‚Äôs moot point anyway city still mask mandate place. Lol okay, and?

It proven COVID-19 SARS.

If diseases asymptomatic cases, want either  boat, vaccinated wearing masks unless required location. point though. point people going get vaccinated wear masks putting children risk. mean, ain‚Äôt broke don‚Äôt fix   restaurants verify waiters vaccination status remove masks everyone know better CDC right   issue statement (and CDC policy change) kids 12 still unable get vaccine. Yes lower risk group, still lots higher risk individuals within due things like asthma conditions effect immune system.  management wrong. state municipality mask mandate must attempt enforce business.  Pretty amazing we'll hit 85% 65+ I‚Äôm fully vaccinated I‚Äôm personally worried wearing mask.

But there‚Äôs going lot unvaccinated idiots run around without masks. plenty people lie vaccinated. Inevitably get people can‚Äôt get vaccinated‚Äîkids allergies vaccines‚Äîsick. think they‚Äôre un winnable position they‚Äôve contrived inconsistent matter lose large swaths public trust. wonder weighed pros cons took swing fence. Either way, I‚Äôm personally happy. see people upset/anxious.  What‚Äôs source. Kids die thing every day. Yah, trying remind patience compassion friends family aren‚Äôt ready full go back lives yet. ready toss mask doesn‚Äôt mean everyone ready too. really think next months going difficult many, think also see lot healing. truly traumatizing many. Oh god yes. additional personal space wonderful really don‚Äôt want give addicated 


For someone claims keep track NYT publishes, haven‚Äôt picked basic spelling skills. Monday numbers mean anything

Having day without deaths reason celebrate? Texas's 7-day rolling average daily deaths steadily decreasing, major milestone. Anyone without political agenda celebrating.   goalposts wheels point. Whenever say I'm going keep wearing masks certain situations, get downvoted hell lmao. care. sick since pandemic awesome. life spent fear dude, fear monger lol   also turn people get sick, they'll blame others taking masks early. Seems common practice non-believers care take seriously get sick, someone close does. Even then, still *their* fault... Internationally, domestically completely different. Airlines private companies without backing state able enforce effectively forgo completely assumption. works choices put risk. Wearing face mask unnecessarily doesn‚Äôt put anyone danger, volunteer virus mule does. really wish cdc leaders would also talk root causes risk groups virus devastating effects on.  addition vaccine, people need lose weight,  eat healthy get healthy.    
But live time would labeling people making responsible health instead taking magic pill shot. 


This course excludes elderly.  much although know 80 year olds run rings around 30 year olds. known year? OCD, confirm, masks never made want touch face more. I'm glad finally take mine off. I'm vaccinated, past year OCD never worse. lot people think OCD organizing things, wish that, usually repeating something touching enough times feels right. slept right since masks thing. first full night's sleep Saturday year half üòä  ‚ÄúLong covid‚Äù serious threat, especially mild cases. Yeah that's true, relies competent public health units governments act quickly believe see it.  Houston, Rt one since May 2nd. That's two months since mandate... (Texas Medical Center Houston data).

Per UT SW Dallas, rates remained roughly static since April, 30 demographic increasing. suspect age group mobile (based cell phone usage) due lack vaccinations amongst cohort.

Rt Dallas Tarrant County ""oscillating around 1"" 2 weeks. noted Rt 1 every major holiday. stay masked prevent individuals risk contracting it. pretty pointless post, no? full category glaringly obvious, year mask mandates.  guess gets even 1 person keep mask on, put one on, success.. Child care public transit require masks.

Exposure considered 15 minutes less 6 feet away. usual shopping. Eh whatever. isn‚Äôt vaccinated really doesn‚Äôt matter anymore since vaccinated. vaccinated people want identify unvaccinated person that‚Äôs prerogative. definitely happen, we're point vaccines readily available many people vaccinated. point, people refuse get vaccinated ""play stupid games, win stupid prizes"" territory. 

We're situation getting COVID viewed individual's responsibility, society's responsibility. anti-mask people want lie getting vaccinated get COVID result, fault. Well clean air... like recirculated without cleaned. Also that's still wearing masks airplanes. Oh, 100%. I‚Äôm sure whole family 2 weeks past second dose, I‚Äôll feel lot comfortable well.  suggesting scientific evidence suggest well fitting N95 mask offers protection COVID? Damn feel like could work cdc that‚Äôs standard announcement wtf Compulsory else what? still understand vaccinated people problems CDC businesses implementing policies.

America always weird boner justice hate concept people ""cutting line"" (ironic rich people cut line everything country) un-vaccinated people lying another example thinking play. Could someone please help understand difference stated efficacy Pfizer, apprx 95% breakthrough results show apprx 99.96 ish effective symptomatic infection. misunderstanding data results ?  wife conversation mask wearing post covid world. question discussed would wear mask cold needed go store things. think will. trusting science. trust science- trust anti-mask, anti-vax people part keeping mask on. before, going now.  I've got child got first vaccine shot, another 5-6 weeks least household covered.  said exactly clicking link. Moderna Pfizer release booster variant ends posing threat. far, none do. dont think anything said 100% incorrect, would say country leans toward individual freedoms choices, vs community choices.

There reason bill rights directed towards rights individuals, whats best city, state country.

Characterizing intention laws anything else focused good indivuals plain deceptive, wrong, best case ignorant. Yeah that‚Äôs dude asked. Save MuH FreeDomS bullshit quit hiding behind it. forgo mask show confidence trust vaccine kids. also keeping kid away masked adults assume vaccinated Oh worry I'm vaccinated even contracted strain entire family start May. vaccinated going temporary lockdown place even contracted virus. symptoms severe ct value viral load value doctor explained high. personally fully agree CDC allowing people maskless oh well.

Edit: us gotten first dose due 2nd got virus.  Yeah around Hi ER yesterday, second blood clot. first March 2020. 

The first triggered birth control, second area, arm, unprovoked. 

I'm getting sent hemotologist getting tested Leiden Factor V. I'm eliquis right now.

I get second pfizer shot recently doubt caused it. 

My question is, extremely serious got two clots around 14 months? I'm afraid want perspective. want another clot. would love adopt techniques clot prevention. urban areas getting vaccine, specifically asian white people urban areas. still huge disparities nationwide across vaccination rates due distrust towards medical community due experimentation medical issues taken seriously frequently. Minnesota specifically, 56% white people 15+ gotten least one dose vaccine, 39% black people 15+ have. We're moving far fast loosening restrictions going long term impacts lot people could wait another month. think hate wear one even working (and yolo too), boils always hating wear one.

It makes sense, physical exertion extra annoying mask on, supposed one on, many would rather moment wreck lungs decades later. wish could sign waiver get nearly 12 yr old vaxxed now. US declared over, yet state rate still fairly high, probably vax rate low compared states. limbo feel comfortable going kids, school starts mid Aug 11 probably approved. state also said masks school, even though CDC recommends still. going long summer worrisome start school year. kids online school year, even though school person option year. Thankfully Jr high son fully vaxxed month, sad 11.5 yr old wait. open full capacity ready. law says serve 100% tables.  unvaccinated people supposed still wearing masks not?

They wear masks, longer enforced. Enforcement happening anyway change, vaccinated people longer needing are, saying one obligated enforce laws?

There laws saying unvaccinated person must wear mask. guidelines.

I think missing CDC clearly knows following, considered making statement.

1) people get vaccinated things vaccinated

2) around 50% population vaccinated, spread much slower even unvaccinated people

3) people already wearing masks, antimaskers almost certainly antivaxers, make difference them.

What happen start making life less nightmare frontline workers. longer need engage violent idiots refuse wear mask. problem antivaxers get sick. employees still required wear masks?  including foreigners come get vaccinated. cousins family literally came knew many people going vacation get vaccinated. friend came friends same. wonder many people US citizens actually vaccinated Literally every expert psychology human behavior says idiots. makes absolutely sense unless goal accelerate herd immunity getting antivaxxers infected. point, need shame anyone vaccinate. work, school. Polio vaccines choice, get society. time , move on.  Poor people difficulty getting access health care, also ones go outside homes work (middle class rich people work home), poor people use public transport more, also smaller houses live people inside, one catches covid, cannot isolate easily many still work outside order starve.

So yeah, poverty factor comes covid personally got two new masks face printed them. hilarious time pic n save little dick nosed kid coming look several times. noticed mom dad ( yeah see got mask usage from) looking too, said, "" yeah, mask. look like, little bigger.. got made larger sure nose properly covered"". yeah laughed joked wild was. told work big events I'm going keep wearing agree mostly practices house, come associated risk. don‚Äôt agree risks make negligent, say. 

It‚Äôs safe possible, I‚Äôm still worth damn. Exactly! couldn‚Äôt even want to. hate kids put risk decision. Yeah, would it? People wear masks unless absolutely get going start wearing voluntarily they're even asked to. People always going avoid vaccines going get one people getting them. live, vaccine demand low, even March, anyone could show even ""their turn"" vaccine location without appointment receive one. Oh god's sake knew decreased transmission vaccination end March, studies variants real-world effectiveness come May. would guess considered three aspects important enough wait peer-reviewed studies.

Dr. Walensky also mentioned CDC Advisory Committee Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommendation vaccination ages 12+. committee external experts last met May 12, looks like CDC waiting guidance expanded vaccination eligibility issuing mask guidance. keeping notes leaves cart randomly parking lot instead putting back corral. also wear mask certainly also vaccinated -- refuse right thing unless forced -- welcome back store. correct way handle states set rollbacks based % popular vaccinated. Something like 40% masks outdoors, 60% restrictions number people businesses/areas, 75% back totally normal.

This gives clear guidance everyone, gives clear incentive everyone, relies social pressure get hesitant vaccinate.

Instead, we've chosen worst worlds we've removed incentive vaccinate go mask, vaccinated since there's passports/proof guidance super muddy businesses still require,  realized everyone gonna get vaccine already gotten now. numbers showing rest population give damn. single person position authority willing vouch woman's story? Meanwhile, it‚Äôs still legal, you‚Äôre protesting it. Would protest mandatory vaccines? 15 days slow spread! Oh, always risk mutation makes vaccine less effective.

Because mRNA vaccines target spike protein, extremely unlikely mutation still recognizably SARS-COV-2 also evades vaccine protection ever develop.

""This could happen, take extraordinary steps avoid it"" good way setting public policy. 3 area definitely did. Never. Can't stand em. Yeah, still get hella sick.   love degenerates vote someone‚Äôs actual experience COVID. google covid cases sort United States sort regions time

I also really enjoy checking 'last 30 days' You‚Äôre mistaken. issue wearing masks businesses required it, skipped many family events due elderly work family circle.

I also never used ‚Äúfollowing science‚Äù cudgel others, thanks confirming one people. alright thanks  flu vaccine!! Florida spiking back huge majority (businesses people) decided continue masks. it‚Äôs moving towards masks see early fall Wow expect response completely agree. initial studies extremely alarming takeaway yours, studies needed. Sorry getting emotional rude, driving crazy appears 90% population idea interest learning covid might dangerous kids. Thank god mine isnt old enough school. literally laughed read child N95 mask. People without kids clueless. exactly create super variant. 


A huge vaccinated population wearing masks. sizable unvaccinated population refuse wear masks. virus trying replicate. Repeatedly trying infect vaccinated. Eventually mutate it. kids? Ill believe see it! already got first dose :) Booking still 3+ weeks lot people, even weren‚Äôt extending time dose 1 2 there‚Äôs way they‚Äôd get dose 2 July. guess asking think good idea adapt anti-social? thankful wasn‚Äôt sitting near them, happen anyway. Waiting customs line, family kept ending near too. Definitely time masks normalized. Jesus christüòÇ  agree completely. want say loud, want encourage much vaccination possible, we're already close herd immunity. Posted above, but:
Well yes, stats true even presence flu vaccine. 60%+ children get flu vaccine every year STILL hospitalization deaths seasonal influenza COVID children (again, CDC). part flu vaccine typically much less effective COVID vaccines - years low 20% (see here: much reason think long-term impacts children worse long-term impacts influenza either - certainly people take recover COVID, also people serious post-viral syndrome influenza. sources think otherwise please refer - seen yet.

There definitely going children die long-term effects COVID - trying minimize that. scientific reason seen yet think numbers higher almost every year seasonal influenza, sense risk children parent informed accordingly. I'm sorry reality airborne viruses work agree opinions. vaccines work? don‚Äôt understand. know people aren‚Äôt vaccinated go maskless.  use nice carrot like ‚Äúcounties/cities/states 50% full vaccination rates allow vaccinated people go maskless indoors‚Äù. risk another surge. think masks still good idea, largely certainly can't *hurt*. Worst case reducing viral load something already immune to.

Plus pisses antimaskers, that's reward. honestly young healthy. Anti-vaxxers anti-maskers huge overlap. Go conservative message board lush unvaccinated folks saying wear masks either. put place policy sensible. I've said previously given state least 50% total population vaccinated + 2wks interior masks lifted. state 40% right now, even putting guidance speaks majority. lived china covid-19 everyone wore mask outbreak. stop spreading one bit. ear loop masks stop anything smaller 0.5 microns. virus 100X smaller that. like putting chain link fence keep mosquitoes backyard. Yeah learned lesson pretty quickly. maybe like month something, afterwards open back up, wear mask social distance. places even enforce mast mandate whole separate issue. I'm saying like went Chinese route, Australia New Zealand. honest think would better early adequate support perpetual state needed done beginning. guess think convince people get vaccinated, top priority right now. 

If strictly based science, would take things like local case rate local vaccination rates account. doesn't. Whats general consensus sputnik? Ive heard news banned countries complications? also made shady cause remmber seeing threads fast? Please educate Ohio checking in. biz that's still requiring masks joke right now. chin strappin'. safety regard COVID similar car. in, likely die COVId die moving car. 

Therefore imposing restrictions rest country reduce minimal risk even absurd.  Looking [Texas DSHS decline slowed 40-50 but, decline continued. think people greatly overestimate much mask protects them. mostly protects others sick bit way around (unless wearing N95, isnt norm). Right there's barely sicknesses going around, people think masks saved them, due everyone else wearing plus lockdown measures. 

If life goes back normal everyone except wear mask, i'm pretty sure still get sick. Awesome! point source that? Mine always way behind yeah, strategy might given southern states stuck &lt;40% bit kick ass... alas... Isn‚Äôt possible vaccinated people plus people covid equals close heard immunity? several countries people given one dose Astra Zenecs vaccine one either Moderna Pfizer, good protection get mix like seeing former vector vaccine latter two mRNA ones? planned way changed reports blood clots young people taking AZ vaccine came out. least America patients right autonomy, means refuse treatment. It‚Äôs pillar medical ethics. said, please get vaccinated haven‚Äôt already. Ok first nobody said anything wearing car that‚Äôs ridiculous. like one saying wear house. 

And immature go route.. 

The people said wear mask still wearing mask. would harass continuing safe? 

That‚Äôs mean mind business. 

They aren‚Äôt harassing wearing mask anymore. believe right say something required wear mask everyone‚Äôs safety. 

Just like someone acting dangerous public. obligation call BS despite idiot understanding people would care‚Ä¶ masks probably dont' even shit. get data from? usually watch dashboard, think updated yet definitely do/did. ""There's benefit thing besides fact protects dying!"" Texas Studies dept University Oklahoma

ie, Foreign Studies program. anymore. anymore. Meanwhile, Floriduh reports 100 people returned dead result hoax virus, making today's death total -100. fundamentally disagree here.

It‚Äôs CDC‚Äôs job collect data report guidelines. guidance people, business government use decide do.

If CDC knows vaccinated people safe without mask, that‚Äôs important piece information public know. 

If want CDC active ‚Äúfilter‚Äù it‚Äôs findings shape public‚Äôs behavior, right think that. would much uproar approach. 

Picture CDC saying ‚ÄúEvidence says vaccinated people safely unmask indoors outdoors public settings. But, don‚Äôt trust unvaccinated people everyone stay masked anyway.‚Äù shit show would be.

The alternative keep quiet it. came light CDC choosing information pass along would absolutely destroy credibility people. THANK YOU! already require kids get vaccinated go public schools. Explain vaccine passport somehow different. ""Wow! Nobody store wearing mask! crazy ***everyone*** store vaccinated! would've thought?!?""  true. 14 year old son vaccinated yet. millennial myself, understand points making. Though thirties. get socialization issues pointing out, education ones seem sort like inconvenience, mean see dulling educational experience ways describing going scar younger millennials genziers rest professional lives, seems like something they'll able overcome; mean education virtual STEM degree sorts able overcome deficiencies. Yeah socialization stuff definitely think bigger issue, unfortunate side effect pandemic, is. needs done that's life, Roll punches. Hopeful outcome encouraging vaccinations. making people feel forced get them, people willingly get it. idea ‚Äúcan‚Äôt stick man‚Äù there‚Äôs man stick to. 

I call toddler-thinking: telling toddlers ‚Äúdon‚Äôt this,‚Äù they‚Äôll certainly it. 

We‚Äôll see goes. also allow kid play cousin vaccinated parents, allow sibling vaccinated kids come visit. lives carelessly want risk child safety it. India reported first sub 300K case day since April 21st year. still ugly India, promising see massive wave may entering decline. blood clotting issue younger people sit much? example heard sitting long time (like long flight), might form blood clot stroke. Covid vaccines make Southern states normal?! Sounds good true... I‚Äôm wearing mask anymore skeptics. They‚Äôve given enough time get vaccine, wore mask risk couldn‚Äôt find appointment. they‚Äôre vaccinated, it‚Äôs social Darwinism time perish. wear mask area mandate. also wear one private business residence asks wear one (or around people do)... while.

If get late fall places still asking me, vaccinated person, wear mask, either ignore request take business/time elsewhere. willing accommodate people period transition, vaccines effective readily available point continuing wear mask serving purpose except quell fears that, vaccinated person, data shows irrational. person unvaccinated, either child (who statistically almost certain major ill effects Covid), person rejected vaccine (who made bed gets lie it), immune-compromised person (who unfortunate reality life that's real bummer, ultimately small enough percentage population world cannot realistically stop turning them). children‚Äôs pediatrician said regard children, knows health histories lifestyles. Please ask pediatrician concerning children. disclaimer, yes, confident family concerned CDC‚Äôs new mask policy. Hope helpful you! well. No. soon. people even want vaccinated fully vaccinated yet. could waited couple months longer. Masks hurt anyone Covid sure does.  Italy, curfew first time history since nazi occupation 1943-45. still curfew, announced could last well july even though cases going fast. biggest worry people become used restrictions movement pandemic restrictions could reinstated case protests, increasing crime rate etc. Europe finally showing true colors honestly.   Quantum Quasispecies Clustering work here. There's whole practice mathematics behind it, yeah: we'll see new variants ""outcompete"" OG Covid19 strain change environment.

It's old mouse trap analogy: build better trap smarter mice survive propagate. virus world: look Polio. Well yes, stats true even presence flu vaccine. 60%+ children get flu vaccine every year STILL hospitalization deaths seasonal influenza COVID children (again, CDC). part flu vaccine typically much less effective COVID vaccines - years low 20% (see here: much reason think long-term impacts children worse long-term impacts influenza either - certainly people take recover COVID, also people serious post-viral syndrome influenza. sources think otherwise please refer - seen yet.

There definitely going children die long-term effects COVID - trying minimize that. scientific reason seen yet think numbers higher almost every year seasonal influenza, sense risk children parent informed accordingly. like going close Target kids vaccinated. hate arguing behalf anti-vaxxers lol, really think grouping together end world. come ignorance. Understanding difference important though trying convince life get vaccinated.

I hope front everything going well you! Chile also went lockdown using 90% Sinovac 10% Pfizer vaccination program. still think CDC said LEAST 50% total state population needs vaccinated inside masks could lifted. least legislating majority. Individual rights go window individual's decision drastically affect others' health unwillingly. Individual rights case taking rights decision making hands others subjected assholes willing consider anyone themselves. think healthcare, paying attention. People railing logic sound reasonable. Talk doctor. experts, especially comes child's health. ninny internet knows shame others topics read qualified provide advice on. 

Its communicable diease. virus polio. virus ebola. Tack shoe  Tell India. 

But yes, every virus mutates make serious threat. still, again, look India. bubble beating head with, ""They're coming yer freedoms!"" nonsense year. Asymptomatic spread low everyone. Always been. stay home symptoms.. Yeah like saying need masks masks important lifting requirement states like 40% vaccinations, right? kind backtracking? Bartenders agree. point trying protect people want safe Corona virus can‚Äôt get vaccine. mention variants still there. honestly say that?  1965! realize badly worded statement. 

What getting making public policy designed protect small minority expense overwhelming majority mitigating things minority (mask up) useful endeavor making assumptions me?

I wore mask required. believe science though, believe vaccinations, think time let people choose want keep wearing not. course not. seems like CDC decided us we're winging now. ""Is toothbrush approved American Dental Association?"" Walmart joke. None workers even wear height all. Fucking blows. strawmanning? Nobody asking zero risk. precautions kids everybody else granted whole time. J&amp;J getting ""blood clot"" press, Pfizer Moderna? They've blood clots too‚Äîin people young perfectly healthy vaccine‚Äîbut there's media reporting them. hide mRNA doses? Well like left planet live on. [I bad Unlike adults (where ""It's flu"" argument hold water), flu *actually* risk kids 12. 

Source: Agreed. 34 year old friend currently month 4 ventilator getting butt kicked thing 11 month old home daycare COVID case room, yeah vaccine news promising I‚Äôm still gonna lay low minute. would think type mask well fits primary issues working outside. N95/KN-95/KF-94 etc. work well allergens. good quality air filter inside trick there.

I would imagine cloth mask effective much allergen air. COVID smaller concentration overall relying humidity air help virus easily go cloth otherwise.

They're different use-cases, makes sense results differ. N95/KN-95/KF-94 masks definitely work properly used. understand year-plus pandemic still people think negative outcome Covid death. Even though there's ample evidence virus cause long-term damage lungs, heart, brain, kidneys, etc. 

How possible know that? Businesses still enforce mask wearing private business. really blindsided. virus. times different now, think people mostly become educated masks matter well country ""thinks"" handled initial wave....EVERY country get turn. total bullshit: Agree. trying add ‚Äúlower-risk‚Äù outdoor activities, still cautious. None kids old enough vaccinated yet one high-risk.  No, nothing peer reviewed,

This important though. study peer reviewed, needs taken pound salt. Real world data good, also incredibly complicated, never measuring ""true"" values, merely values detect. That's big problem talking something presents anecdotal evidence vaccines help slow transmission.

Sorry, clarify claiming vaccinations impact transmission - clearly do. problem know much controlling things like social dynamics.

The risk unvaccinated individual becoming infected vaccinated individual function probability vaccinated individual infected rate someone infected vaccinated sheds virus, assuming mitigating factors (like masks) play.

We're unable determine many breakthrough cases actually significant number asymptomatic (and vaccinated + healthy people going get tested), makes significantly difficult determine either probabilities degree accuracy. pretty sure point rate viral shedding reduced vaccinated individuals, even so, breakthrough cases significantly common realize (which undeniably real risk right now), amount error calculation essentially infinite. Therefore, goal reduce infections, relax restrictions collecting enough data able make calculation within reasonable margin error. Well, get enough people vaccinated matter, seems plan.

My guess (which obviously speculation) CDC fully aware this, the, ehm... Social dynamics play, betting change policy convince people vaccinate would become seriously ill vaccinated people antimaskers significantly less likely get vaccinated. fair enough guess, change fact also haven‚Äôt seen data shows vaccinated people asymptomatically shedding virus, I‚Äôd like source that. 

Most I've seen admittedly anecdotal - things like recent group infections tied northern sports team vaccinated come mind, got asymptomatically infected led multiple infections. Part problem basically contact tracing infrastructure, impossible determine infections coming from. Anecdotal data good guidance anything else, act conservatively dealing public health. words, anecdotal data good pointing potential complications, used basis relaxing restrictions. tell may problem, thing rely come solution. reference? I‚Äôm confused people like gung-ho it? You‚Äôre desperate show lips breathe people? 
Shit I‚Äôll wear mask long need to, hard do. Doesn‚Äôt effect one bit. 

But man. Ain‚Äôt nobody gonna change mind. sincerely hope sarcastic here.... ok trusting Gavin Newsom make judgement scientists CDC? think might want check yourself... again, political. automod terrible keeps removing expertise Oh man, least mine decency wait next school year. already mine coming home school teased wearing two masks, dropping one next year going help, considering live huge Republican area. son asthma - mask keep daughter safe. can't believe selfishness out. actually, can, ~this America muh rights~. really think CDC didn‚Äôt think that? know largely relies honor system still decided high enough levels vaccination wouldn‚Äôt matter people took advantage guidelines lied vaccination status. people largely following guidelines correctly following masking guidance anyway.  many places still local business mandates place. Wow sucks ass. Sorry hear Ah gotcha. I'm Colorado outside Denver Little side note, spent better part last two weeks Myrtle Beach funeral, seemed like mix, places like Food Lion Jersey Mike‚Äôs almost nobody wearing masks, employees included, place heard employees asking people mask gas stations really easy treat identify get blood clot? arent affected it. It‚Äôs non-issue.  Every state lifted mask mandates seen increase cases. need name obvious public information. Yeah someone who‚Äôs worked likely cardiac event way five years up.  üíØ. reminds Bush Aircraft Carrier mission accomplished sign behind him.  expecting July vaccinated numbers closer 50-60%. currently 36% nationwide.  think signals people middle people feel need follow vaccinating. even 10yd line think barely field goal range. never learned lessons Shin Godzilla trying impart... Kids arent affected virus. They‚Äôll fine. new variant orders magnitude likely come countries overseas world vaccinated. can't unfortunately, influenza virus reservoirs wild, like birds. always come back. Sort of.

It's allowed kids proven issues socialization similar.

Also parents must prove headmaster adequate technical knowledge.

Also kids test year. pass test, conditions satisfied, back school.

So basically depends. like people opt school kids home. Hate join here, Abbott malicious next dictionary. man piece shit. Dallas, report same. update scheduled 1pm, almost certainly going thing. effect, although AI learning. Pair sunglasses don‚Äôt mask conform outline face you‚Äôre getting somewhere.

Then learn change walk defeat gait analysis. Even waited six months remove masks, would still people would say would soon. precaution getting ill, think relying masks herd immunity reached I'm ill I'll definitely wear one way stopping infecting others.  stores still requiring masks? Fuck yes! I‚Äôve saying months good Memorial Day! cannot wait get back clubs. fantastic. It‚Äôs finally over. hmm, thought that. guess ID potential burglars/robbers? Honestly this.It stayed strong recommendation wear mask instead enforced made political.

Those opposed masks never wore properly cared enough use correctly. anti-vaxxer told vaccine vaccine/isn't effective 100% instead 95% multiple cases people vaccinated ended infected.


I asked condoms 98% effective cases people still ended pregnant. 


They started insulting me. I‚Äôll take getting common cold every year masks everywhere go.  wore mask 3 months mandated here. going take bit feel comfortable indoors without again. I'm waiting see numbers go next month anti vaxxers give changing habits. hope youre right bc fear go back stores, cities, etc banning mask wearing. Many places case guise preventing crime (it doesnt prevent crime) real result nobody going wear masks Target. Anyone vaccinated point either cannot get one (e.g. children), refusing probably believe masks either.

Honestly see openings going another spike, albeit non-vaccinated people bringing danger onto themselves. think good policy. Although accept must end, ""highly unlikely"" plain wrong. gf's grandmother infected three months second dose although mild case (so vaccine protected herself) CT value 16, means infective, average unvaccined person. Studies show, vaccines mainly protect others, youself God hope case. Whiney legislators get enough body vote certain way, gonna change freaking constitution. Lunacy. stop arguing masks try convince people get vaccinated? I‚Äôve convinced conspiracy nutjob friends get vaccinated, too. appreciate guideline plan follow myself, there‚Äôs tens millions Americans don‚Äôt get paid sick leave. They‚Äôre going go work they‚Äôre sick won‚Äôt make ends meet otherwise. encourage wear masks do.

The US also mandate paid sick leave getting Congress won‚Äôt happen time soon. meantime, Americans encouraged wear masks they‚Äôre sick public. opinion person asked question to: 


If vaccine stopped dying effectiveness seen COVID, would put bar ""mandatory vaccination"" high, 90%, high. someone dies he/she right.

If vaccine particularly effective stops transmission, may point, case afraid Pre-pandemic allowed lot businesses laws ""violate individual rights""? feel like drawing arbitrary line individual right depending wether agree not. Every law think prevents something. post useless Singapore‚Äôs recent outbreaks tied asymptomatic infection fully (or mostly) vaccinated groups - hospital airport staff. western media seems skipping worrisome point. please stop using vaccine sticky? someone subreddit info side bar, they‚Äôll click want it. Otherwise it‚Äôs clutter bad design. Name then. Thank you, I'll keep eye ones revise comment. feel way do, doesn‚Äôt mean don‚Äôt think idiots. Oof‚Ä¶you‚Äôd think global pandemic would make companies reevaluate sick policies. don‚Äôt understand basic sick pay isn‚Äôt legally required. It‚Äôs honestly barbaric. interesting reassuring sources, thanks sharing.

One isn‚Äôt quite reassuring study [described NIH shows adjusted risk reduction 0.2 (with wide confidence interval, unfortunately) infection second shot either mRNA vaccine. translates 80% efficacy asymptomatic cases compared 90% found two studies cited.

It‚Äôs popular talk reasons asymptomatic infection still concern person infected, won‚Äôt comment. Suffice say personally willing continue taking precautions that, even I‚Äôm fully vaccinated. Chinese definitely handled far strictly others initial outbreak. even issues connecting flights. 

You're talking extra precaution initial outbreak, sure. Wuhan / China epicenter that's correct thing do. That's ""animosity towards China"" 'standard procedure' mentioned install new law fine heavily 'spreading fake covid news' testing. 

I guess know talking either. [Here plan developed several pandemic scares till SARS 2003, developed tested 2009 H1N1, fine-tuned published 2014. Changes include pandemic response policies, hospital medical interventions, Traffic Control Bundling, effective vaccination programs, countries catching positive cases past year, hear it.

Just hear... oh forget ... seriously expect British give vaccine doses, you? Yet. learned anything past year, discount possibility.

I continue hedge bets. Wearing mask really costs nothing. 99.96% efficacy. 

It's compared anything else. 

Efficacy vs unvaccinated. comparison group. raw percent vaccinated test positive. 

95% symptomatic disease. 9 vaccinated people trials symptomatic disease. 0.05% participants. analogous inverse 99.96% number. That's conflating two things, Fauci Adams understanding national shortage attempting protect it, admitted later, later realized effective cloth non micro fiber facial coverings preventing spread.

Don't whitewash lie, didn't, admit learning it, hopefully. We've got 1000 new cases UK, we've opened indoor pubs &amp; restaurants today...

I genuinely worry lockdown #4 could come next month, although know exactly much transmissable Indian variant compared UK's. It‚Äôs ok feel whiplash struggle changing mindset. absolute best thing get vaccinated protect around you. still free mask comfort level adjusting though. completely different situation compared last summer vaccines feels soon many, it‚Äôs positive step. get bidet Based data sinovac others they've submitted approvals, seem less AZ Johnson Johnson?

Not good mRNA ones Pfizer Moderna , comparable AZ J&amp;J

China supposedly mRNA vaccines end 2021 I‚Äôm exactly understanding I‚Äôm picking choosing here. went Walmart today saw exactly one person mask off, soccer mom 2 year old.... like wtf One word: thalidomide. I'll give that. think really everybody point particular situation. People still wearing masks Midwestern city, continue too. Phil Murphy scrambling I‚Äôd say No. People say ultra variant happens (doesn‚Äôt even ultra variant, readily infective) large, unvaccinated population put people higher risk. 

If variant infect 30% vaccinated people, unvaccinated people exponentially expose vaccinated folks increase chances get infected. absolutely understand percentages. we‚Äôve choice get fully vaccinated now, vaccinated wear masks chose to? free country make choice make ours. also live consequences. Right living consequences chose get vaccinated. It‚Äôs long enough choices made. let‚Äôs act accordingly. CDC says children account less 10% total number cases cases kids show little symptoms. means get immunity infection. Kids end hospital dying tend underlying conditions affected virus. great planes. I‚Äôve worn planes since pandemic. helps keep nasal passages drying super low humidity. Definitely recommended. shit Statistically much Unvalved N95s protect wearer around them. Uh yeah think ‚Äúnot airtight‚Äù describe 40-60% reduction perhaps underselling not-air tightness haha fast way kill get COVID. WTF talking about!? thought CDC‚Äôs actions questionable along. slow act every turn issued questionably-worded press releases. Well suspect New Jersey won‚Äôt far behind.  Begs question, effective Moderna Pfizer vaccine newly found variants India? feel you. specialists initially said thing, esp history anaphylactic reactions meds. ended recommending weeks later caveat know well works yet continue cautious. Meanwhile, entered single building except house, hospital receive infusions, week ago, fully vaccinated parents' house since March 2020. employer expects us back office within next weeks. assume file ADA accommodations continue working home order stay safe.

I actually looked forward able things like go grocery store pharmacy accompany pets vet's office infection rates down. Thanks CDC, complete seclusion continues. advocate vaccines whenever possible. I've done part, wearing mask anymore. neither required CDC, president, governor state. 

If people want wear mask, them, health theater unless one unvaccinated. vaccine renders pointless. I‚Äôm even opening worms lol. very, different people. try new things, like going bar hanging friends, sometimes. don‚Äôt know like you‚Äôve never tried. Living bubble healthy. Cool story bro wasn‚Äôt even politicization outside influence though regards masks. making decision based estimates pandemic would spread work. beginning pandemic people worried fomites- turned barely issue. big thought masks really don‚Äôt work well regarding truly aerosolized virus- COVID doesn‚Äôt spread like though virus lives spit droplets get blocked mask. aren‚Äôt purely research organization. I‚Äôve saying one foremost experts disease RESPONSE. new information came altered response. 

Now I‚Äôm going say response wasn‚Äôt politicized. don‚Äôt make policy tailor recommendations make sure got somewhat accepted policy makers. main point vilification people cdc people work far overblown extremely good organization. 

Wow got long winded hope makes sense Many states laws, GA face covering restrictions go back white hoods KKK places theft prevention. GA wear bandana face riding like wear full face helmet can't wear either gas station pay gas walking street.  think another week two lot people stop masking legitimately say CDC say vaccinated people get rid masks classic gaslighting. downright falsehood anyone easily disprove. Good fucking god I'm looking forward next shift. Good, need everyone covered, jabbed course! friend mine wife got kid, 6 year old, got school. wife 30 yo, incredible shape, spent 2 weeks ICU. Barely managed survive. Still suffers neurological issues, basically PTSD, stared death's door 2 weeks. 

Fuck anyone says can't get kids. oh living? know healthcare/the human body pediatrician make claims?  really wear masks then? much 456 kids ages 0-10 admitted ICU positive Covid. 82 died Covid. Yep, trials ongoing results expected September. Target definitely enforced masking LA. Target work strongly enforced till last months. beginning would stop anyone without mask. exempt anyone claimed couldn‚Äôt due medical conditions, tho.

Now don‚Äôt even enforce all, vast majority people still wear them. grilled cheese sandwich always contain ham tomato. one stopping others continuing wear masks. Yasss, finally remove ""95% adults"" count vaccination trackers. I'm gonna cut predictions end state emergency now. area explicitly requires parental approval even though I'm 16 Would restaurant ready overnight going 50-100% capacity? Clearly never worked restaurant. completely change staff floor, increase line cooks, order right amount food physically cook food volume...it overnight thing. know that. likely going end case, point taking chance vaccine coming September.

Perhaps risk small, mitigation measures even smaller.  think Spanish Reig Jofre start""fill&amp;finish"" J&amp;J vaccine June (up 250 million doses per year so), hope help EU deliveries. maybe bottleneck somewhere else.   person gets extremely sick due obesity becomes walking contagion factory coughing store. Exactly!  Absolute garbage take. Ebola 90% case fatality rate. want get back normal life. friends vaccine they're already returning normal life I'm still stuck masks social distancing :( Kroger, everyone still wearing masks Ohio. worked China.

Meanwhile US, means matter end , 580k dead COVID. Hell yeah, summer's gonna low Reynolds number, shit's gonna laminar üòé CDC represent global scientific consensus. They‚Äôve fact odds many times pandemic, masks, aerosol transmission, choosing track vaccine breakthrough cases don‚Äôt result hospitalization. obvious behaved AIDS crisis well Trump administration present. There‚Äôs indoor mask mandate still place Israel, much higher proportion population fully vaccinated. expect see countries vaccines become globally accessible, assuming they‚Äôre sincere pursuing herd immunity (which US already given on). covid new threat overall easily preventable. driving common flu kills hell lot less people. absolutely false equivalent arguments. driving, everyone making decision drive scenario. know risks. someone forced work, choice, make choice come Covid, choice made them. many voices saying many things start. biggest plant world flu vaccines. Sanofi-GSK massive. got told take mask malls priror virus sick wasnt allowed wear masks working many retail places. got many writeups till finally fired one place cause refused. Oh explained plenty. Whether comprehend you.  guess understanding CDC said, fully vaccinated protected. regardless others choose wear mask, impact you. 

Basically mask point going help people arent vaccinated, therefore think CDC making choose people. arent vaccinated protected, wear mask, else accept risk. people fully vaccinated longer risk people's choices. Alcohol affects alone. COVID not. Get fucking grip. analogy looking seat belts.

They mandated.

Most morons think seat belts protect wearer. fact protect wearer people around them, since human body projectile accident. I'm likely die car accident way Walmart catch rona vaccinated living house sick people. argue costs? Vaccinating people also reduce cost, less visits ER covid. tell vaccinated? r/birdsarentreal  She. also accused murder past got acquitted. kind people power India pandemic became downvoted completely agree. There's every evidence towards safety efficacy point people selfish. We're worldwide pandemic, millions millions dead, people willing wear damn mask get proven safe vaccine (and think mRNA could pop side effects year, please go read works). people enjoy living purgatory? Get damn vaccine. similar friend, I'm going ask comes up. Absolutely. lot treatments also make less likely well. vaccinated, even later test positive much less likely get bad outcome long term issues 50/50 masks live Florida you‚Äôre exaggerating It‚Äôs particularly important poorer countries buying given AstraZeneca, [10.4% effective South African variant. far studies shown Pfizer holding variants. think says lot NY, carefully considering CDC recommendations weekend, considering concerns pushback, ultimately decided whole point CDC's change, whole point change, say people, 'There benefits GOV. ANDREW CUOMO

This encouraging people take shot. expressing confidence efficacy vaccine telling people uncertain vaccine good enough end pandemic, take shot.

Yes, people lie it, people never get it. people need little push fence. I'm sorry hear that, hope recovers well time. science suggest something different entire nation's policy makes sense individuals individual communities. CDC's guidance tailored entire nation. look case rates local area; lot places community spread near nonexistent now, that's true area there's really point keeping kid home, unlikely even meet anyone Covid. Evolution work ... takes tens thousands generations make difference. We'll never see difference single lifetime. 

Also, evolution care politics, religion, race, wealth equality. Evolution cares lucky enough survive reproduce another generation. 

Humans much potential evolve highly intelligent beings well regress back neanderthals hunting squirrels nuts. 

So argument conservatives leaving behind weak less desirable liberals say far right drive us extremes inequality .... long run right, always possible. Oh boy, can't wait go target buy pok√©mon cards! Trump obviously everything wrong. know could want Biden administration. They've done everything possible get vaccines out. Tucker Carlson going TV saying vaccine killed 4000 people going fuck things up. would anyone care keep kids target?

I dont think anyone hates hearing say don‚Äôt. know fact variants affecting kids differently. That‚Äôs pretty easy actually. drivers license, you‚Äôre old enough exam room without parents. would probably getting vaccinated regular check (if it‚Äôs mandated), ask talk doctor private about... Period stuff penis related stuff... tell doctor you‚Äôre alone already received vaccine shouldn‚Äôt tell parents. Ah yes stupid person makes 7 figures taking care idiots like hospitals. We‚Äôre talking cost healthcare needed situations. Also addressing vaccine implications come taking taking affects doesn‚Äôt others. Sit read actual thread. actually ended quite nicely.  Outside maybe polio, when, ever, point time many people taken vaccine once? think year clinical trials jabbed hundreds millions people shortly thereafter pretty sufficient evidence safety. nature mRNA would show significant effect risk quickly. There's chance something popping year line. never said anything eating dirt lol yeah I‚Äôm sure germophobe less beneficial health long term. Can‚Äôt hide forever I'm 'unpopular' opinion vulnerable population vaccinated, open every thing (sick/old/ect). point dumbass 20~30 year old want get shot catch it, likely going kill long term side effects. Might even get luckily removed gene pool! Yeah freedom healthcare system great!!!! We're free get choose hospital one sue us. protested mandatory vaccines then? huge news developing world. Pfizer best class production capabilities soon distribute vaccines also countries lack freezer capabilities western countries. 

It seems like Pfizer saving vaccine effort EU, also able serve beyond western world, viral vector vaccines troubled production. Yes - CDC comparing statistics flu vaccination COVID without one! 60% children receive flu vaccine every year still see higher deaths hospitalizations seasonal flu! Flu vaccine effectiveness vary decent amount - low 20% high 60%. definitely possible years vaccinated child less risk flu COVID, we're least ballpark. show nasty mofos. Hehe also autoimmune disorder worried giving immune system excuse dick. following science. don‚Äôt know much kids. foolish parade child around store unvaccinated individuals throughout. understand people choice, I‚Äôm referring them. ‚ÄûBoth EU source spokesman said company still aiming deliver contracted 55 million doses end June.

J&amp;J faced production problems United States. EU official said doses meant EU produced United States factory Leiden, Netherlands.‚Äú

Both positive points otherwise negativ news! scienc–µ, maybe violating people's rights bodily autonomy would rightly cause protests... problem CDC looking macro level, individuals care micro level making decisions. 

The guidance wear masks early pandemic CDC trying make sure hospital workers could get PPE remain job. might good advice country whole, particular individual would better wear mask. 

The Question happening - CDC made announcement think help persuade people get vaccinated, helping everybody.... individual especially higher-spread area, makes sense keep wearing masks. communities still mask mandates. Same. also swayed politically, we've seen. I'm giving strangers side-eye wearing masks places call vaccinated individuals, I've already heard two discussions convince people OK wear masks. know bad strangers glaring wearing mask, I'm mystified anyone gives sh\*t people wearing mask minding business. whole, agree, we're unique situation choice kill others. choice affects alone. true, vaccines equal, particularly AstraZeneca. Israel vaccinated population Pfizer.

The AstraZeneca vaccine found ~10% effective South African (B.1.351) variant published New England Journal Medicine March.  Ummmm... one suggesting that. want people continue wearing mask indoors public DON‚ÄôT keep kids isolated home there‚Äôs way tell actually vaccinated lying asshole. probably scariest thing family ever went through. 

Especially time last year, literally epicenter epicenter. health system alone quarter U.S. cases. hospitalized 15,000 patients months. 

I actually COVID positive late March wife sick time. really, really scared ‚Äì especially her. went hospital environment, chaotic. transform lecture halls ICUs. make huge tents outside hospital overflow patients. give ICU level care places thought possible. rearrange doctors front lines doctors hadn‚Äôt done critical care years it. Initially, lot patients dying. would hear ‚Äòcode blue‚Äô every 5 10 minutes. felt like war time ‚Äì close bomb raids WWII, I‚Äôve read time. almost akin that. comparable all. Lockdowns put lot economic strain people businesses. Masks piece cloth face.

When comes reasonableness requirement, consider cost vs effect. Lockdowns expensive effective slowing spread. Masks cheap effective slowing spread. reasonable say end lockdowns (which pretty much every place US done now, least degree), many arguing masks *so* cheap *so* effective keep them, least longer. Immunocompromised contacting work reasonable accommodations. accommodations could work home moved position requires minimal public contact along company provided PPE. example local McDonalds nice older woman worked 6 years. pandemic moved grill given mask cook instead drive prevent exposure. talk go still healthy. vaccinated. Another example current job coworker going cancer treatment working permanently home since vaccinated. people speak spoke management regarding need accommodations law accommodated. Regarding children, niece cannot currently get vaccine even though eligible 6 month immunosuppressant therapy. sister contacted school updated situation. virtual classes 2022 school year reasonable accommodations vaccinated finishing therapy. time parents immunocompromised adults seek accommodations place rollbacks restrictions set continue. Transmission 100% exposed though?  correct pluralization. Meijer's wrong, Meijers refer multiple Meijer stores correct. Sorry, factually untrue solidly established science. Asymptomatic transmission people transmit virus even cough people potential catch virus spread UNvaccinated people only.

Furthermore, weakened immune system, vaccine might work well you. others cannot get vaccinated similar health concerns rely herd immunity.

Here's trustworthy source regarding asymptomatic transmission, people without symptoms transmit infected people transmit virus symptoms don‚Äôt symptoms. important people infected identified testing, isolated, and, depending severity disease, receive medical care. Even people confirmed COVID-19 symptoms isolated limit contact others. measures break chains transmission. Tell why. vaccinated, choice, putting others risk illness potentially death. zero choice matter, simply space you, made completely selfish choice. would actually put money certain states passing laws \*ban\* wearing masks public within next year. there's shortage ICU capacity proportion US population legitimate health reasons prevent getting Covid vaccine extremely small. group also definitely overlaps people immuno-deficient people shouldn‚Äôt anyway. Cancer patients different timing recommendations vaccines example. matter spin you‚Äôre vaccinated it‚Äôs safe traveling, eating out, going mask less events, like, yeah wearing mask protect others.

COVID isn‚Äôt Ebola, Ebola also hasn‚Äôt killed 600,000 people USA. It‚Äôs joke. know young people 20‚Äôs gotten severely ill suffered life altering side-effects may may resolve time. There‚Äôs also lot asymptotically infected people walking around major organ damage infections, haven‚Äôt able thoroughly survey across whole asymptotically infected population.

In contrast, vaccine carries almost non-existent risk serious side effects point. blood clot risk also non-issue US. There‚Äôs glut mRNA vaccines don‚Äôt blood clot risk people probably avoid ones cause clots they‚Äôre trying get vaccinated.

At point people choose get vaccinated opportunity deserve punishment missing out, they‚Äôre inflicting harm huge swath population. It‚Äôs gotta start somewhere though. valid argument. anyone says something contrary need shut down. Yeah someone immunocompromised I‚Äôm worried ever. Thanks CDC Biden. basically 0 effective vaccines guy‚Äôs definition effective 90%+ incredibly effective vaccine. It‚Äôs also risk reduction, 95% less likely catch virus symtpoms, unfortunately people like less interested statistics truth instead interested justifying twisted version reality digress. company policy enforce them, reality, there‚Äôs nobody actually enforcing. put signs door, it‚Äôs honor system, unfortunately. super rural area same. many people unmasked, masked correctly. *shrug* premature all. vaccinated point you. ample supply schedule shot anywhere. Sadly we're getting point there's anyone else wants whatever stupid reason.

I've responsible whole time. I've pushed harsher lock downs mask mandates. now. time move on. two simple choices going forward. Get vaccine get covid take chances. enough vaccinated 65+ population worry hospitals overrun. What's ideal ""get vaccinated, move life""? mean parts country anyone could already go maskless since places actually fully enforced mask policies. People want wear masks don‚Äôt want wear masks won‚Äôt.  Exactly. want use us leverage force mask compliance unvaccinated.

This entirely unreasonable unacceptable, vaccinated opinion. Offer give. give. I'm favor state enforcing personal decisions. South Carolina like 90% people never wore masks store required them. Especially Walmart UK busy area mask-wearing rare outside shops public transport. high-risk, received AZ vaccine, bit data variants plan keep wearing FFP3 mask I'm house. three experiences since beginning pandemic strangers cornering telling wearing it. one threatening, two garden-variety rude.

The thing chose wear FFP3 *expressly* worry anyone else around doing. never harassed someone wearing mask, dream so. frankly nonsensical stranger hold responsible anyone did. 

I respect lot people felt frustrated last year -- believe me, among -- would appreciate people would refrain taking frustration me. person trying go goddamn walk many days inside. KGB protest communism vaccines does... CDC end all. shot un-vaccinated people. CDC basically saying vaccine works one wanted it. Masks protect you, protect everyone else. removing masks, people longer responsible health. want protection now, need vaccine. gym nation wide lifted requirement. Might state Mmmmm never moved goalposts. there's regular posts like mine maybe there's lot people comfortable lifting restrictions. last year shown us cant trust right thing, mandate lifting rewarding antivax antimask folks assholes keeping shit going first place. vaccination rate high enough heed immunity true, yes I'm going worry. People responsible, people still continue die contact covid left long term effects, NEEDED go fucking bar go movies. asking population 40% obesity rate ""keep fit healthy""? asian culture wearing masks sick fucking brilliant imo. reports state catching covid, even mild case, may cause long term damage lungs, heart, cause vascular problems otherwise such? 

I'd rather risk myself. one needs issues, let alone starting 12 no. mine. 

Also America. Long term medical bills alone scary AF. passing onto kid. 

To I'd rather risk that.  great see China fearing India /s point? *does* cross line, immediately, personal freedom argument utter horseshit. did. Like said actually trending downward. Spike. forum would allow post screenshot would. lazy look yourself. Same. People hate hearing say (kids get it, kids can't spread it, 99.99999%, blah blah blah) there's harm waiting weeks. Cases plummeting, think they'll still plummet, I'm exposing free-for-all crowded stores we're close finish line anyway. US one libertarian countries world; even case country founded. true we're far country based solely libertarian ideology, absolutely apart political system. think that‚Äôs location dependent. local target Walmart 100% masking. got noses sticking otherwise masked. don‚Äôt mask mandate anymore went yesterday would say 80% still masking you‚Äôre vaccinated still concerned, keep wearing mask it‚Äôs hard. know I‚Äôm protected I‚Äôm going keep wearing people don‚Äôt want get vaccinated. Thank you. made point day. said face masks, decided I'd listed way said need them. in, ignore. still will, unless there's new study talking unexpectedly high hospitalization and/or fatality rates among kids. 

This lockdown damage wider number kids, psychologically educationally, COVID ever could. Biden administration decided push forward

The Biden administration even know announced was. Joe Biden know announced was. expecting it. Mine 12. meant ""finish line"" terms community spread continuing erode comfortable zone summer. Day care masking everyone plans continue so. Yeah, Walmart NEVER told single maskless person put mask on. 

Roughly 30-40% shoppers wear one area even peak. may want look kf94s something provide protection haven‚Äôt already. I‚Äôm sorry, it‚Äôs definitely frustrating. relative can‚Äôt get vaccinated yet wants to. Children 2 get viral vaccines...  US given first doses around [46% sake conversation let's say need ~70% immunity herd immunity. percentage people vaccinated also caught covid, life went completely back normal total immunity around 50-60% basically see local outbreaks slow growth cases. massive growth like early 2020, least half population immune, certainly areas/communities low vaccination rates could see outbreaks.

What's likely short term everyone fully go back normal. Kinda hard estimate get vaccinated also keep masking careful, might add points towards people who've removed risk pool. Mm never said work, said people cant trusted. never said stay closed forever, I'm saying gonna weeks there' vaccinated people walking around. Open stuff up, get rid masks. masks help stop spread, know work, get rid soon? 45% fully inoculated, that's enough people make public spaces safe yet  would vaccinated continuing wear mask like (say, due allergies flu season keeping face warm winter) considered ""dragging feet"" lumped category unvaccinated antimaskers? 

Personally I'll probably continue wearing one live industrial city lots factories chemical plant, smoke stacks line skyline pumping pollution 24/7. Helping filter stuff bit i'm outside pretty great me. 

Sometimes worried possible harassment, though far much occasional loud obnoxious conversation wearing mask standing checkout line. imo country European Union western country.    actually aware recently. 3 thoughts this.

1.	 diseases like measles, mumps, polio, hepatitis, yellow fever, etc, alot different covid, lethal.
2.	the vaccines mandatory thoroughly tested literal decades. covid vaccine even officially approved FDA.
3.	requiring vaccines historically lethal diseases public school requiring vaccine covid facets life. (Some people favor requiring vaccine passport virtually anything public interacts eachother)

In summary, premise apples apples, therefore fair compare them. helps put mind ease bit! Honestly, nursing tough road us, help great lactation consultant, we‚Äôre finally good place. weren‚Äôt possible antibody benefits nursing, however slim, probably would‚Äôve stopped. Texas lifted March. still decline cases. Even Fauci said didn‚Äôt know why. it‚Äôs pretty simple. vaccinated people means less risk people feel need wear mask without mandate. people around still masking large stores malls.

The thing Texas people wanted wear masks, kept wearing masks, want wear masks, wearing first place. seems would forge signature even want chance working. seems like I'm still luck. 4 weeks ago went San Antonio Spurs game. Limit 3200 people stadium 20,000. entire row ourselves. crowded time pretty fun really worrisome coughed on. It‚Äôs open general public area far longer month. 

Covid tapering since early year. yes taper two weeks I‚Äôm sure makes better time now? two weeks someone like saying wait two weeks longer tapered kids gotten vaccine. two weeks someone make point. end? proven stupid opinions valueless would care them?

They still people deserve treated humanely. inherently superior anyone look someone views ""think stupid"" (even case masks vaccines correct). kick grieving healing person makes feel good might actually make terrible person happens right side history *this* time. disagree assertion, reflect value so.

I'm saying never talk people views masks/vaccines. I'm saying appropriate conducive argument period grief healing. Tactfully present case later time emotions heightened, otherwise escalating conflict. can‚Äôt change meaning words lol u/LostButNotGone ‚Äì You‚Äôre absolutely right! finished treating patient CVST -- young woman 40s. Patients history thrombosis likely risk COVID-induced thrombosis. Get vaccine. vaccine prevent getting severe complications COVID. chances getting VITT chance getting struck lightning twice. 
  
Although man actually get struck lightning twice:  Start bribing people. $500 tax credit gotten vaccines. feels weird wear masks, I've vaccinated 4 months still want risk even 50% people vaccinated Oh agree. Different methodologies, different vaccines, different variants around, etc. Like said, studies map.

But interesting pretty much see people using highest number find, smaller study people one profession, working one hospital system, one region, one country, younger people. That's 80% comes from... pretty much every study, including different methodologies much larger studies, lower. Could point specific science precedent giving concern particular vaccines' long-term effects? feel like really done reading FDA every regulatory scientific agency worldwide said enough data, enough precedent years research similar vaccines target coronavirus variants. no, ""feeling"" enough done something put argument worldwide expertise scientific knowledge. means watching much YouTube. Read science original sources. pretend know things don't. I'm glad vaccinated. I'm sad yet chosen spread typical antivaxx propaganda nevertheless. husband fence (he thinks antibodies, despite never sick, assumes asymptomatic carrier). know many people never sick, yet assume must contracted somewhere.

Meanwhile, I've fully vaccinated two weeks. husband's workplace announced Friday fully vaccinated people stop wearing masks office. think push husband needs get shot I'm glad. Whatever motivate get works me! There‚Äôs still little risk even NYC park. Yeah lets ignore fact little research done long term health covid-19 infections, long haulers, organ damage, like. kids, fuck em. /s Right, 1 year old go stores winter things bad (NY). went handful (3 think of) stores last summer things better went outdoor outlet mall 2 weeks ago change scenery. plan changing approach mask mandate lifted week.

Heck, even plan change really much I'm point. (mostly grocery stores occasional big box store + cooking home/takeout, gym) going take mask gym soon I'm allowed since I'm 3 weeks fully vaccinated? 100% yes  think home depot customer mask on, around would make difference :( Power you. Okay wearing mask vaccinated specifically prevent people socializing? weren‚Äôt talking pandemic whole, masked vaccinated people. still socialize mask see friends. Also it‚Äôs good mental health, socializing still exists via video calls stuff. don‚Äôt mean seem rude you‚Äôve almost lost friends couldn‚Äôt seem house sounds like meeting wasn‚Äôt issue lack effort continue talk text issue. think many speak ""Eastern European countries"" Soviet rule. know define today, speak west/east used P100 respirator main reason feel family survived covid. go work every day wearing 8 hours straight **fucking sucked** goddamn I'm happy vaccinated. 

Extremely based 3M. question is, enforce it? Mine doesn't.   cases past month labeled imported seemed weird. Like people would test negative arrive, Taiwan 3 month test positive get labeled imported case. large number hospitalisations deaths vaccinated

You probably quantify mean ""large number"". know something breakthrough cases? spent week Miami convention could count two hands many masks saw entire week. believe exaggerated all. state eligibility open anyone age 12 over. 
Your age important factor determining vaccines receive. 
Patients 18 must consent parent guardian receive vaccine. Patients 16 years old must accompanied parent, legal guardian, authorized representative. 
Please ready verify get pharmacy/clinic.  Yeah talking outdoors. indoors part threw everyone (including White House) loop. long haul long term effects covid-19 infections poorly understood. kinds horror stories starting come organ damage virus. I'm risk child's long term health assholes bored masks care infecting anybody else. Every person know kid 12 going continue stuck quarantine masking children vaccinated. dont think idea. mask issue personal thing now. vaccinated protected. others choose wear mask arent vaccinated impact you. arent vaccinated want protection continue wearing mask. 

So nessecary honor system much want protect not. Maybe don‚Äôt write up, I‚Äôd think something mess employee around well. Like mention nice one‚Äôs sick masks, etc. This, feel like young kids get completely forgotten this. son 23 months doesn‚Äôt many words, likely he‚Äôs isolated since 9 months. idk I‚Äôm going explain masks him/try get wear one. can‚Äôt put danger sake getting life Covid new long-term damage documented young children, plus there‚Äôs COVID-related inflammatory disease kids getting. It‚Äôs hard choices. True. live outside Madison. seen unmasked person business ever recall. Went 'back home' rural Iowa Walmart 75% masked, honestly better would expected. love it. mRNA all! live Gibraltar 

But it‚Äôs issue dealing twice (possible 3 times) Pfizer compared J&amp;J‚Äôs one done 

And much heart issues, really bad case Trypanophobia results panic attacks around needles could lead heart attack, also tend get abit violent state (no control I‚Äôm like this) harmed people before, got worse swine flu jab thought smart idea force order spoke children‚Äôs pediatrician regarding concern. pediatrician concerned all. said benefits outweigh risks. recommend speak children‚Äôs pediatrician well. reason got vaccinated hope shed mask. I've followed guidelines every step way continue so. I've hated wearing mask entire time. uncomfortable something always aware of.  Plenty people wearing masks even covid. office lot Asian employees, always saw lots masks winter, especially people took public transit office. started wearing mask public transit sensory issues months covid, started wearing even frequently areas smoking. I'll wearing mask long people smoke wear strong perfumes public! (I special masks filters supposed similar kn95s. think fabric mask works well. tried standard surgical masks.) know, I'm pleasantly surprised early is. said wearing mask protects others yourself, explained wearing one protect (albeit indirectly). That‚Äôs all. true, talking indoors - places still able make wear masks indoors - least live.   see mentality everywhere. frankly care, got care others risk this. long wear mask.

I think knew huge section selfish people way beyind anyone thought. [archive link anyone trouble accessing article feel target employees. What‚Äôs disgusting $5,000 bill insurance company pays negotiated price $1,200 example. Uninsured pay full price. Ay bloke, press review claiming showed right cdc. record agree reporters sucking science, isnt news site, cdc also claimed supported you. source ignore reality pretend know talk about? Lol ok coo coo also don‚Äôt protect wearer much protect people

This scientists originally believed told early on. others shown linked articles thread, we‚Äôve learned masks protect wearer well.

That said, children 2 can‚Äôt wear masks. they‚Äôre public aren‚Äôt protected unvaccinated people don‚Äôt wear masks. Oh look, it‚Äôs someone doesn‚Äôt work retail kids school.  know vaccine makes extremely unlikely catch it, even unlikely symptoms, unlikely transmit it. plenty data research support this.

You stop spreading anti-science.  Dr.Evil entered chat Emmy? I'll tell I'm tired of. People acting like parents willing let kids live normal lives bad parents. 

It's beyond annoying me. I'm worried fact almost 1 year old twins live isolated lives far (even though tried hardest make like that) catching covid. short enough require copied. Agreed, point pretty definite shift attitude sub toward selfish rather community, really rubbed wrong way. definitely stepped away bit that. Interesting, I'm glad feeling better, I'm deeply curious - sleep wearing mask?? pretty racist thing say, evidence whatsoever beside skin color. never really good idea base decision random people's ""weird looks."" got wearing mask grocery store March 2020. Guess still never Covid. think also slight difference examples. Vaccination affects others well eat affect mainly yourself. son attend school mandatory get shots. need get exemption (Medical possibly religious), attend private school move different district. months long enough see effect new variants children. normal person would compare physical harm *prevents*, especially someone yourself.   Yeah numbers game point..many provinces opened mRNA shots 18+ already. Tough sell give AZ got plenty shots, terms avoiding even rare side effect.

Save AZ dose two disagree point, bit different personal choice affect lives health others - exactly something 100% personal like eating good diet. Guessing live NY Oregon jealous states got rid mask mandates restrictions didn‚Äôt see spike? people downvoting this? Didn‚Äôt China give India ton vaccines recently? It‚Äôs lot harder keep safe nobody‚Äôs masking anymore. US, enough vaccine uptake pandemic here.

Incorrect. achieved herd immunity vaccination seasonal wave.

There still enough people vulnerable COVID-19 overwhelm health care system.

And includes vaccinated folks lower immune responses. People autoimmune conditions require immune suppressants.

Chron's, arthritis, lupus, ms, immune suppressant cancer therapies, post transplant, etc. conditions breakthrough infections likely occur deadly.

I'm disinterested trying convince lives matter. point J&amp;J would demonstrate vaccine advantages mRNA vaccines unclear possible.

I'd hope ""it's single shot"" would enough advantage. leaving that. leaving economy. that's even worse: immigrants leaving first sign problem look good immigrants parts world seeking integration.

not good all.

anyway that's see it, may wrong course. know people may people probably 5 months that. lot talk anxiety

Also, rude anyone media negative spin almost everything related virus? There's multiple layers people variety different reasons, sometimes reasons blend, reasoning/beliefs hold stronger others. one take solution, making convenient one valid solution. 

One friends considered vaccine hesitant spouting ""not knowing long term effects ""untested"" even register appointment - things could easily alleviated minor research reasoning, ended getting vaccine happened pass Shot Beer event microbrewery wanted free beer lol. Yeah protection offered vaccine renders mask essentially useless. Tbh couldn‚Äôt care less people option get vaccinated choose to. communities continue ravaged virus that‚Äôs fault. I‚Äôm fully vaccinated ready go back enjoying life. reported lot should. Someone must plugged wrong number somewhere CDC didnt catch specifically anti-vaxxers, happily stop masking

Anti-vaxxers already happily masking. behavior going affected CDC's recommendations changing, listening CDC already thing. care, selfish grass clump  Oh yes, press. Reporters great reading primary scientific literature.  saying also said wear mask start. see reason would lie research take say account. clearly infallible That's science works, use ""common sense."" PROVE DISPROVE. suspect. humans dumb expect science give binary rules OMG 6 feet away gonna 100% safe  Solved! Ask election. Yup , trying enforce year resulted people shooting killing employees, ya let's keep Exactly, CDC fucked dog one (excuse me, ""screwed pooch""). get unvaccinated people get vaccinated telling lie it. Putting people least likely follow guidance honor system dumbest thing. mentioned businesses may require proof vaccination privilege. still get people forge documents, there's nonzero number would take easy route get damn shot.

Went Wal-Mart weekend judged books covers, large people wearing masks seemed kind people likely vaccinated people wearing masks seemed likely vaccinated. need shortage semiconductors. Ship TSMC many mRNA vaccines necessary cover workforce. ‚ÄúI told early signs Indian variant AZ vaccine may 10 15 percentage points less effective severe disease. efficacy Pfizer Moderna vaccines thought better.‚Äù 

This would disappointing true. Even reduction overwhelm hospitals, would still major blow risk individuals take away peace mind since vaccinated. wish reporters wouldn‚Äôt throw stuff like without backing statements. Feds could mandate fed property it‚Äôs actually big change practically happy help. job wants return office well office culture drains can‚Äôt go back. i‚Äôm trying play hardball see let remote lose since plan quitting anyways lol. best luck you! tell want alive, take vaccine I'll drop dead something. Hell, even Republican suburbs, Walmart Target enforcing masks even back June. pontificating Gavin Newsom following science early pandemic shame follow through. CITY BOSTON REOPENING MAY 29TH big. City Boston delayed reopening 3 weeks repeatedly. Now, Boston aligns Commonwealth Massachusetts now. date paper, indicative saw weekend San Diego. Went weekend, over. Maybe 20% masked bars, 5% masked outdoors. Gym morning 50% best. one getting paid enough enforce masking point. Yes. Local state governments restrictive health safety regulations. wild. Can't believe walked gas station without mask went hockey game one day still lol. people say ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt care wear mask forever then‚Äô people giving weird looks demanding take mask off, pandemic over. nice reassured people judge mask wearers, likely plenty will.

A kid lives neighborhood gone around picking kids wear masks. Nevermind *he* got it, gave family, older brother already asthma problems hospital two weeks. 

I think there's going *huge* backlash people continue wearing masks CDC's advice used bludgeon. even see people consider mask-wearing ""anti-science"" way. That's probably using american version ""two sides"" one republican democrat corporate boot licking capitalists. yes ""sides"" pretty similar. feel comment spiritual level But, people make 90% COVID-hospitalizations received vaccines now? 7/10 people UK antibodies, going hospitalizations ever before? makes absolutely sense. main complaint can't stand bars entire posse can't fit bar time?

What tragic miscarriage justice Mason? courtesy, please try give space parents masked kids see store. can‚Äôt tell vaccinated isn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs kinda nerve wracking right now. Science can‚Äôt tell whether mandate masks. said, that‚Äôs policy.

Science tell whether masks effective. are. reduce risk whether vaccinated not.

Science also tell vaccines effective. are. also reduce eliminate risk.

People think it‚Äôs soon lift mask mandates indoors still following science. science says that‚Äôs less risky everyone. Whether it‚Äôs good policy move outside purview ‚Äúfollowing science‚Äù definitely understand frustration throughout ordeal. assuming speaking personal experiences immunocompromised individual pandemic. imagine frustrating you. May ask, pandemic managing day day exposures life prevent severe illness?

This mandate apply traveling. freely travel want masked patrons. Everyone still required wear mask scenarios:

""If you¬†travel, still take steps to¬†protect others. still be¬†required wear mask¬†on planes, buses, trains, forms public transportation traveling into, within, United States, U.S. transportation hubs airports stations.""

[Masking Guidelines Vaccinated new guidance basically allows private businesses ability enforce enforce certain recommendations honestly way since beginning. choose shop stores business still requiring masks. also still shop businesses adjusting new guidelines still wear mask, socially distance, avoid large crowds going hours crowding minimal. 

Regarding cost prohibitive N95 masks, able find NIOSH approved masks great costs online retailers retailers. help costs disinfect N95 masks oven wear cloth mask extend life N95. One N95 mask last entire week using method. 

[Dry Heat N95 Mask want lives go back normal whether healthy, immunocompromised, etc reality us make long term adjustments vaccine uptake increases. American faithfully masked, socially distanced, missed countless funerals family milestones, vaccinated protect around me. regret shut past year half saved lives done enough curb pandemic. looking forward seeing mom vaccinated along dad. I'll damned someone tells selfish wearing mask see them. past point. worked hard deserve spend time family friends get back normal way living. wish best adjustments us inevitably continue make get this. Ok consider masks hide ugly faces make hot people seem right amount mysterious see covid simply excuse finally wear masks.    Northern mask sight Kroger. I‚Äôll continue items brought car, suppose.  export meaningful number doses domestic demand reaches zero; likely little still. really expected point, make whole lot sense withholding many millions doses simply much need within borders. goes double AZ doses still even approved use. CDC infallible. example, lied virus airborne months. unreasonable suspect could underestimate many Americans lie vaccinated order go unmasked much disencentive new guidance anyone fence get vaccinated. That's crazy. live Minnesota, count one hand number people I've seen wearing mask indoors since mandate put place.  Canada average wait second dose 4+ months. we've ramping vaccine rates, lot people, including myself, still fully vaccinated while. I'm wearing prevent common cold. 

Next winter, probably wear mask going Walmart mall heavily congested area. nice getting sick last winter. tell betrayed first refusing allow protect deadly disease. job ensure safe healthy, shirked responsibility. so, person aware potential consequences health &amp; future contract virus, protected yourself. end, can't trust rely anyone else look you; must take action required. CDC governing body. new guidelines simply said - vaccinated, need worry masking indoors outdoors - that's it. Simple that. individual states decide utilize guideline. CDC decide logistically execute guideline, states do, NJ made call that, enforcing masks unvaccinated cannot logistically implemented, cause undue burden individual businesses. 


 also think made right call here, gives new approved age groups time get vaccinated. Either way, FL TX end spectrum, it'll serve good test resilient vaccination levels spread. Yeah deal inevitable public push back choose mostly falls employees enforcement. would like see proper study that. anecdotes dentists.

FYI, cleaning medical equipment patients normal procedure normal times anything stop transmission respiratory droplets aerosols. hope last date September, final extension. &amp;#x200B;

First, thanks well-considered response. fundamentally disagree here.

&amp;#x200B;

I think actually agree CDC do. seems diverge characterize CDC currently does. 

I believe CDC much filtering. tries make value-judgements cost-benefit decisions Americans, rather empowering Americans make better decisions themselves. CDC editorializes much: everything either ""safe"" ""unsafe"" little room nuance. science gradually mounting quite time vaccinated Americans significantly less likely catch significantly less likely spread COVID. CDC chose pass along: sitting growing pile scientific evidence without reporting it. inscrutable conditions met CDC decided time act. led whiplash: went ""even vaccinated, safe wear mask indoors!"" ""if vaccinated, totally safe indoors without mask!"" little indication changes coming, communicated justification abrupt turnaround. case unable google search. Yeah reported early ""don't mask"" see turnaround admitted wrong later. reported media.  vaccination rate 65 extremely high even areas low overall vaccination rates.

Good them.

I'm talking them.

I'm talking nearly 70% that's vaccinated.

It's idiocy look wave hit Los Angeles think happen half country unvaccinated. Ah, there‚Äôs real root it, don‚Äôt care neighbors health. don‚Äôt think anyone else should. fully eradicating it

That‚Äôs definitely happening. smallpox eradicated vaccine.

Even optimistic estimates percentage end vaccinated still likely what‚Äôs needed herd immunity. Sars Cov 2 endemic many years come. anti-science, plain simple Um...Covid isn‚Äôt seasonal like flu. Wow, $100 better 5G signal? deal!

(this joke) Tack Monday, heavy backpack Tuesday, over-the-shoulder boombox Wednesday, cane Thursday, unreasonably loose shoes Friday, unreasonably tight underpants Saturday.

You six alter-egos, one gets trouble, lie low while. Masks can‚Äôt perfectly protect unmitigated spread people get vaxxed, don‚Äôt, don‚Äôt wear masks themselves. 

We ability, species, legitimately solve problem. We‚Äôve done things like polio measles briefly. It‚Äôs obvious protect greatest number lives. choose to. didn‚Äôt state imply decrease slowly. OCD different everybody, case hasn‚Äôt really effect me. know someone effected though, hands always dried sanitizing I'm transgender. think misunderstand OCD. People OCD irrationally fear obsess things basis reality. One irrational fears I'm trans. Since I've always loved guy, OCD attacks makes obsessively worry nonsensical fear I'm actually trans woman denial whole life lie. Hi, family Leiden Factor V II mutations (I II though) - think clotting risk higher COVID mutations present? think I'm going start using curbside pickup stores Krogers still reviewing  Ok. Last response, overall point need force people wear mask anymore regardless vaccinated not. point someone choices wear mask unvaccinated hurting really hurting people anymore. 

I consider similar smoking, would recommend smoke since hurt however choose cause me, nonsmoker, anymore major issue. Someone propose chain events. ;)  mean, [preliminary suggests much 50% covid survivors lung damage Vaccinate people first! Naw idiot make speed limit safe based area intersection. 

Doesn‚Äôt even make sense you‚Äôre saying. 

Yea vaccines also millions anti-vaxxers refuse get shot. 

That didn‚Äôt change there‚Äôs way many losers lying‚Ä¶ title ""India"", ""global surge"", ""U.N."", yes American immediately thought affect me, pretty obvious they're talking India article probably talking countries lagging vaccines, good access them. title pretty clear talking globally. Uptake 95%. That's factored models. 5% still hundreds thousands unvaccinated people, and, given data suggests Pfizer AZ 93-95% protective hospitalisations two doses, huge amount spread still cause thousands hospitalisations vaccinated. COVID cases surge exponentially, hospitalisations follow, irrespective many people vaccinate. must reading comprehension issues. comment never said people poverty could afford health care. 

My comment recognition people poverty typically limited life style options (diet, exercise, etc) exacerbate health issues enumerated Fauci.

Nationalized health care doesn‚Äôt improve diets. Doesn‚Äôt provide options exercise. got fully vaccinated Pfizer weekend. one first line opened everyone April 19th. ready let‚Äôs gooo. understand influenza dangerous twelve COVID19, correct?

So stating need masks protect 12, clearly would needed influenza dangerous age group.

Or else, believe science, think COVID19 dangerous influenza 12. COVID19 warped ability judge risk. throwing away science think COVID19 somehow worse influenza age group. not. science clear.

So disagree CDC? data support that? understand anti-science this?  Plenty stories business owners floating around saying exactly this. guess bullshit let virus wash country likely hundreds kids dead thousands hospitalized. Yeah, strange see. Especially considering side Americans try portray rational, science-based side. obviously trying argue good faith so... good job guess Oof person irresponsible teaching kids. don‚Äôt critical thinking skills get vaccine can‚Äôt teach children functional adults. Sorry fireable offense teacher. disgusting  know people fake covid vaccination records. assume lot know of. I'm gonna keep masking instead assuming everyone unmasked fully vax'd. unusual.

I'm impressed. wish could get county US even half that. Even prior mask mandates still saw extremely large percentage people wearing masks store, I'm sure. mean eventually I'm sure people stop wearing them, in, say month bet 50% still wearing them.

Plus could liability issue. agree. surprising. Many epidemiologist said week ago probably never reach herd immunity. time accept pre-covid anti vaxxers, anti vaxxers right, gonna happen. wasn‚Äôt lab whose job create sort things... lol‚Äînot love ones vaccinated. vaccinated mom gets sniffles sore throat breakthrough case Halloween party think deal that. unvaccinated uncle ends hospital coming Thanksgiving would devastated‚Äîbut wouldn‚Äôt change fact fault refusing shot. again, unless think vaccine doesn‚Äôt actually work, don‚Äôt understand problem is. always, important remember two things:

* Neutralizing antibodies entirety immune system.
* Infection thing disease.

Vaccinated people people recovered Covid likely getting small levels SARS-CoV-2 infection continuously relaxing masking social distancing requirements. mean get sick Covid-19. immune system spin antibody protection stop nearly infections make person sick. point, tranquilizer dart guns tranquilizer replaced vaccine starting sound like good approach hitting vaccine targets (literally figuratively). Source what? can‚Äôt use google? Get vaccinated keep wearing mask want, people understand risk moving on. sick enough need oxygen, ventilator, medical monitoring, classified severe disease.

A simple google ""severe disease definition"" yields results multiple official sources stating this. Usually catch flu viral infection like flu year even small cold. guarantee still wear mask colder months indoors takes remain healthy. hate sick.  pumped! Fully vaccinated last Saturday. Ready party!! Receiving first dose sinopharm watching people sub fully vaccinated Phzer feels like pleb among aristocrats. mask doesn‚Äôt protect me.

Your vaccine does. vaccinated, protected. experts tell us, science tells us. vaccines safe effective. vaccinated, immediately. are, congratulations done part move past epidemic relax. Yes, take 'hella sick' mean hospitalized.  Probably date ever occurred us cautious people completely consistent whole time? based opinions one simple question:

Is mass death happening?

We're still averaging thousands Americans dying per week (**edit**: fixed): answer still ""yes"". Therefore, keep masks--the easiest mitigation method--for little longer? Reopen activities sooner, course already happening, masks one last things go. fact want death rates lower **does mean goalposts moved.**

No one promised pandemic would specific date. ***is*** ending--we see signs. think ""balance"" choosing actually balanced best way things? choose wear seat belts extra comfort, get good balance in. started using bike rides never realized much road dust inhaled! I‚Äôm finished don‚Äôt feel congested itchy. someone unable seek medical attention, like impoverished, living rural areas, etc,

Is advisable take low dose aspirin, like baby aspirin, COVID positive? That's totally relevant article Poland. Yes pediatrician says kids don‚Äôt need mask. do. Mask fully vaccinated. According you??

Haha ok. 

You seem overly concerned everyone agree you. 

Plus doubting got vaccinated. 

But couldn‚Äôt careless. Ugh. parents live Coastal Bend area refuse get vaccinated. yell every time talk.  It‚Äôs important that‚Äôs role CDC. job inform people safe disease, push people away safety measures. I've developed germophobia this. never even gave thought costantly analyze everything touch think cross contamination time. Shit sucks. It‚Äôs it‚Äôs business vaccinated individual want go without mask now. odds transmitting vulnerable person believes COVID taking precautions effectively zero. It‚Äôs technically possible it‚Äôs going happen. 

I (and assume people) won‚Äôt bat eye people want keep wearing masks don‚Äôt want preached don‚Äôt care people. I‚Äôve done needed protect people last year change. I‚Äôve done can. Driving compulsory. There's section FDA evaluation page - - safety adults - mostly minor symptoms. Dont give kids history severe allergic reaction, including anaphylaxis. really significant risk case rates fall everyone else getting vaccinated? mean really debate masks, work wear 100% confident thing over... losing ""culture war"" morons society  No, CDC probably understands science this, necessarily make good public policy. People lie vaccinated wear masks, despite CDC saying shouldn't. people lie, likely going get sick despite vaccinated. long term consequences incredibly concerning  online booking system must've designed Nintendo They're less effective, mean shitty. Research Chile Brazil shown superb results herd immunity decreased hospitalisations People love signal moral superiority others. shame one ever taught pride sin.

With every passing year, become convinced America never stopped puritan nation. Even much population dropped religion, simply found something else sanctimonious dicks about.

I'm seeing increasing number people social media saying they're fully vaccinated, they're still going wear mask *purely* way signalling political allegiance superiority kind people wear masks (this assumption; they're actually open it).

I really hope mentality spread rest world, although past experience taught almost certainly will. Thanks facts links. Asking question fear mongering. government literally authority something ‚Äúthe greater good‚Äù

So think government actually does? things lesser good? Basically every law greater good. getting downvoted bad-faith question. sub covid-19. answer question obviously covid-19. 

If wanted try reassure OP children low risk, say - certainly read way.

This nothing politics. put kid car without seatbelt, go race drunk people highway blindfold on? that's better example sort world think people come antisocial? already live antisocial, less communal lives ever. hard time seeing positive. Huh. opinion mandatory cannot happen resisted, see point. really relative, like explained. Trust science, unless agree it... think reacting. Masks outdoors didn‚Äôt wealthy powerful people behind it, unlike businesses. I‚Äôm fucking nervous shit. People quiet long-term effects covid. r/cursedcomments Yes, agree that. People claim move ‚Äúfollowing science‚Äù need sit down. Masks almost effective preventing disease vaccines require little investment / inconvenience. goalposts ‚Äúwe‚Äôll return normal reach herd immunity.‚Äù goalposts moved. undoubtedly result CDC forecasting vaccination rates‚Äî we‚Äôre obviously even worse expected vaccines politicized Republicans. CDC making move appeal directly people right political spectrum, ones turning masks culture war issue. 

But critics right point isn‚Äôt effective. It‚Äôs going make indoor gathering safer vaccinated unvaccinated. It‚Äôs going encourage large numbers people get vaccinated. It‚Äôs going diminish culture war surrounding masks vaccines. We‚Äôll lucky get half population fully vaccinated. encourage risky behavior public. give cover people avoided public safety measures. give cover governors dismissed virus throughout pandemic.

It‚Äôs like survived first winter Covid decided since numbers relatively better, it. much decline new cases we‚Äôre seeing due seasonal effects? opening absolute infection numbers double time last year? science, it‚Äôs politics. Science based data. data said needed mask mandates lifted. reached herd immunity seems current course, may never hit herd immunity. political decision made accept let chips fall may. It‚Äôs gamble without level data scientists would find acceptable. Hence outcry scientists. 

We‚Äôre fucking brings us one step closer nightmare scenario: variant drastically reduces effectiveness vaccines. sub covid discussion geopolitical conjecture

that's right Looks like NY fully opening Wednesday. Masks required unless business requires kidding.  Closing beaches, trails, parks stupid health theater happened wouldn‚Äôt look bad weren‚Äôt paying businesses stay closed. Wait, really? Even Arizona? live less minute away CVS! I‚Äôm referring mental health political aspects jobs I‚Äôm terrified son getting it, amount heart damage they‚Äôre finding kids... doesn‚Äôt look premiums deductibles though.

More companies shifting high deductible plans aren‚Äôt making contributions. Meaning there‚Äôs millions American individuals deductibles high $7k. families it‚Äôs $14k. it‚Äôs [not high paying 
that this, it‚Äôs often people making $50-$70k year would pay $7k pocket healthcare expenses insurance kicked in. means millions people avoid getting treatment. 

High deductibles huge problem one main reasons Americans health insurance avoid getting healthcare need it. They‚Äôve already [linked delayed cancer

I'd rather live like recluse. can't take away bodily autonomy people people revolting streets end reasonable people becoming anti-vax. still plan wearing mask years too, wanna like pre pandemic actually end pandemic, eyes? I've seen conflicting stories. say we're rounding corner, others tell deadlier new variant strains.

Thanks, job, AMA. I‚Äôm boat you.

The idea test within meaningful populations prevent widespread panic ill-effects false positives. would overwhelm medical response system divert precious resources wrong places. 

Many countries high testing rates community spread anyway untold deaths. Taiwan made clear beginning strategy, implemented SARS H1N1, best approach balance medical response keeping economy open.

Agreed. going turn hot mess anti-vaxx masks wearing take advantage this. Many us also still process getting vaccinated.

Dietary habits highly infectious airborne disease rampaged across entire globe. think one remains somewhat seen - certainly encouraging little influenza was. possible limits travel (particularly Australia/New Zeleand/Southeast Asia) short circuited flu start. I've seen number experts expect high flu season US due viral competition (but explain Aus + NZ despite much COVID).

It seem likely suite social distancing guidelines played part reduction flu, would shocked try methods next flu season - though think unlikely get good results masking + moderate social distancing next year - think viral competition travel restrictions likely played large role (but think completely defensible think masks + social distancing played lion's share it). get 2nd dose week. I'm fully vaccinated yet I'm little nervous job research you. highly upvoted like 4 different subreddits well mainstream media.

According American Academy Pediatrics‚Äô latest report 15,000 Covid hospitalizations 300 Covid deaths children overwhelming majority kids get fine, severe Covid cases certainly common getting struck lightning.

And spread virus sometimes (studies generally shown young kids spread half often adults teenagers spread often adults), although matters lot less adults much greater risk get shots.  I‚Äôd agree COVID vaccines several years old, fully approved, proven safe effective.
