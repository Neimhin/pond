Got first dose yesterday, expecting long ass time. 
I work police put broadcast anyone get *** location quickly get one spares, 20m journey definitely worth it.

I mind idea last, definitely much vulnerable people need guess job do, even PPE, we're probably level teachers / schools, come across lot people day day most.

Feel like shit today definitely worth it! Uh, what? You‚Äôre using historical death figure reason stay lockdown longer? Sorry, that‚Äôs works. weekly rolling average figure matters, cratering. 

Comparing different locales longer valid due differing vaccination rates. 

If want hide away forever, that. Nobody going stop you. thread gone. Stop arguing! great hear!! Lol gonna happen. Biden supposed mandate masks across nation never happened outside transportation. 

If can't even mandate masks zero way he's going mandate vaccine passports businesses point still stands though; pretty much every factor think (such shutdowns, mask mandates, population compliance, weather, holidays, location, etc.), bunch examples going opposite direction. example, Arizona live, spike summer, might say everyone inside way hot. even bigger spike winter, nice time outside. look graph. 14 days, maybe 10. Yea yachts lol downloading app hard people, they‚Äôre gonna real hard time existing I‚Äôm worried incredibly small percentage.   Bingo. exactly correct - declining mortality amongst elderly mean we're automatically woods. can't enormous upswing case counts without also upswing hospitalizations/ICU.

What surprises widely misunderstood, even sub. see threads every day people saying elderly protected, immediately end restrictions. Except let contagious variants rip everyone fully vaccinated, still going see rise hospitalizations (and younger people critical condition). happens, see draconian measures like lockdowns go effect there's choice protect health capacity. Governors residents wait two weeks lifting restrictions traveling? 146,438 doses administered Canada yesterday. 

Yesterday, Canada Vaccinated 0.375% population. equivalent US vaccinating 1.24 million day. highest Sunday report record represents roughly 60% increase past two Sundays.¬†

14.6% Canadian¬†*adults*¬†(18+) least one dose.

11.7% Canadians one dose.

Ontario (84.17%) continues vaccinate National average (82.4%) % available doses used.

Previous Federal Sunday Reports:

March 21: 91,600

March 14: 92,658

March 7: 57,567 It‚Äôs reason PA slammed last time, proximity NY NJ, also surging Death rate always important factor.

Saying moving goalposts...again. think initially uptick going out/dining out. However, prices restaurants bars increased notion eating every meal possible. gotten used drinking home may go novelty, expense make common. Yes, mean ingesting random vitamin good. Science work 10 random articles.

In italian simposium respiratory physicians vitamin yet considered cure, maybe prevention, evidence dose usual confounding factor (this time sunny places usually less flu like symptoms lack vitamin might explained usually poor people vitamine deficiency usually live crowded households, less education exposed).

And italian physicians saying this, NIH still wavelength change short time without strict evidence, expecially medicine. Anyone trying sell vitamins road ""ionizers"" are. 13  defiling disease must wear torn clothes, let hair cover lower part face cry out, ‚ÄòUnclean! Unclean!‚Äô **46**¬†As long disease remain unclean. must live alone; must live outside camp.

Had look one I'm religious. exception shouting ""unclean"" think pretty much applies us working via Zoom. hair unkempt sweatpants torn. course. simply addressing point provide study show &lt;70% efficacy 14 days, even though methods study shown &lt;70% efficacy Pfizer vaccine 14 days first dose

Curious see would kind study something would give better estimate efficacy one dose people exposed virus 10 day mark, 14 day mark, 21 day mark (who would become symptomatic roughly 15 day mark, 19 day mark, 26 day mark respectively, give take, assuming mean time 5 days exposure). sure numbers yet kind precision. Many vulnerable people still waiting chance get vaccinated. someone‚Äôs eligible doesn‚Äôt mean there‚Äôs availability. care. simply care many harmed....they care covid restrictions lasting forever. Like you‚Äôre using percent absolute numbers sounds scarier. 

They went like 15 19. 

That‚Äôs noise. Making sound like isn‚Äôt safe Americans shouldn‚Äôt trust absolutely damaging. played left. It‚Äôs absurd bs behavior. discredit Trump. PROUDLY say vaccine went arm Friday funded operation warp speed ordered Trump admin. I‚Äôm idiot like current president said vaccine arrived White House...after already fully vaccinated. Revisionist history much. chunk positive cases likely lateral flow false positives (0.32%). Every 500,000 lateral flow (what schools use) would expected 1600 false positives. people least one positive COVID-19 test result, either lab-reported lateral flow device (England only) per 100,000 population 

Currently requirement positive lateral flow retested PCR test. good you, im sure social score went point lot anti-mandate people. It‚Äôs masks don‚Äôt work, it‚Äôs people choice forced wear one. 

Most people wear mask it‚Äôs right thing do. won‚Äôt, government shouldn‚Äôt fine jail it. one wasting breath now. lot people simply give shit anything forever Lockdown covid. probably trolling either, they're mentally disturbed. blue surgical masks longer considered safe enough.

Wow? require n95 masks? That's insane. everybody access them? Yeah born 1993, one first group get chicken pox vaccine. guess whatever reason, protocol state get one dose. went college, end first semester, discovered one dose said allowed register classes Spring unless got second dose.


It big deal all. NYC level hospitalizations deaths decline. spite stable relatively high infection people saying saying ""wait get vaccinated"" they're saying need ""new normal""

Make mistake, lot people WANT continue, getting downvoted oblivion should. Simply saying need wait vaccine available everyone controversial.

That said, science matters science matters. fact can't get people acknowledge new surges among young people likely lead situation putting hospitals funeral homes brink absolutely nutty explicitly anti-science.

Do know many times see posts Michigan hospital surge young people 800% find we're talking single digit daily increase? many people blatantly claiming vaccines offer zero protection spread that's shown simply case.

My favorite pointing someone 30s died it.....yes that's tragic simply norm. I'm talking surges. I'm talking upcoming one. sure clear. Honestly? Probably, yeah. Even Fauci would probably say yeah. Dunkin donuts donuts awful... like them!? sad, covidi airborne?  vaccinated participating digital passport. get around fine choose get vaccinated. Coronaviruses around while. guess made response MERS outbreaks 2013, thankfully become pandemic. Ah Republicans going get vaccines cause anti vaxx nice. Makes sense also weird cause PA air state areas Republican...so like places probably giving vaccines either unless somehow Republicans anti vaxx. Definitely. finally realise great decision was. NY app show covid test results proof vaccination anyone know what's going Chile? One highest vaccination rates cases/deaths going down. I'm tired. I‚Äôve never said open everything.

My stance along been, x% vaccinated, open percentage.
For example : 50% vaccinated? probably 50% capacity restaurants, stores, etc. 

The point wasn‚Äôt open floodgates return 2019 normal tomorrow. idea continue completely shut *everyone* vaccinated, some, silly.

In fairness you, assume you‚Äôre American. Maybe you‚Äôre state stuff open. I‚Äôm Ontario, 10% vaccinated we‚Äôre talking another full lockdown. don‚Äôt believe way. Mandating vaccine studies long term effects seems like bad idea. people taking vaccine taking chance long term health, like choosing take it. I‚Äôm early 20s made educated decision taking vaccine, 80 didn‚Äôt worry much long term effects I‚Äôd probably decide otherwise can't imagine they'd popular domestically we've got high vaccination take anyway hospitality businesses probably reluctant turn away customers closed long. think they're good thing travel though. I‚Äôd argue we‚Äôre damage keeping kids isolated school. society don‚Äôt know long term risks yet! anyone know what's going Chile? One highest vaccination rates cases/deaths going down. Schools can't make 6-foot rule work, therefore 3-foot rule must ok. something. think Taiwan Australia did. different situation different culture, right lot fatigue many restrictions. support mass closures. Even liberal states. NY opened restaurants outside NYC 75% capacity. Oh, need commit comedy here. See ends posting something social media ""seizure."" Downvotes coming DeSantis fans appears. short, one knows... stay cautious!

Click bait title. Yes, variants concern. people businesses cannot tolerate another shutdown. People desperate go back work, school, normal life. risks need taken. r/iamverysmart Fine?

I wish every hospitalist said fuck I‚Äôm working 40 hour weeks pre-CoVID19 staffing ratios, maybe you‚Äôd see fine surges hospitals. seen that, good idea. enabled BREXIT? proven, say someone who's covid, first shot worse. someone hasn't, second one is. kind people try buy hitman darkweb get busted police scammed can't go police complain. know. J&amp;J vaccine approved single shot version even though double shot version would almost certainly effective. goes Pfizer - single shot version work, less effectively second shot version. FDA approving approving something almost nothing actual safety efficacy. Oxford vaccine proven work beyond reasonable doubt UK it‚Äôs still FDA approved. They‚Äôre joke. totally right thing IMO. logistically possible roll national database vaccinations crossed referenced vaccine card someone saying vaccinated? I‚Äôm thinking something names plane ship‚Äôs manifest run database weeds non-matches (similar fly list). articles like make people care getting vaccinated. Maybe state level, federal level messaging certainly Sounds like trying furiously excuse prior administration's Coronavirus track record. Shit happens life often. Leaders - even believe someone else fault -- can't waste time finger-pointing positive action must taken. Investigations wait. 

What saw previous administration made much obvious: recent president leader job description only. spotted sub created 2013???? It‚Äôs getting really sick part that‚Äôs concerning. someone help reconcile statements article?

Trying good responsible lol Surprise kids actually go school days without vaccinated... Oh people partying 28.2% US population least one shot.

15.5% completed regiment.

That‚Äôs long way getting 70% even naturally acquired immunity. definitely true lot states. camping computer getting appointment This. much this.

Its straight poisonous. figured yet?

Most people saying want hermit lifestyle end. mean like US significantly worse Germany, Scandanavian countries, even degree Spain? I'm denying SFs policies effect, serious problems analysis. one, seasonality viruses much weather patterns. lot school openings, holidays, travel parts country (i.e., spikes SoCal due weather, spikes SF due people bringing up). Second, dates opening/closing really even align spikes even primary cause. That's prove causality. Matching data eye pretty low bar likelihood getting right 

SF also unique situation massively politically aligned (so infighting within city fighting state government, high actual compliance public measures, falls category ""a"" ""b"") massive work home population. Even still, deaths SF \~20% lower US average. We're talking night day difference. 

If want choose really strong points, data really supports *early* intervention key. SF got right, undoubtedly saved lot lives kept baseline caseloads low, gave nice cushion future spikes. However, pinning spike opening bars/restaurants level evidence technically sound. Dumb people dumb. I'm beyond caring point. Fuck em throw corpse funeral pyre.

Smart people get lives stupid people continue die suffer long-term disability.  received first vaccine shot (pfizer) almost exactly one year Covid symptoms appear. 

The shot made feel like got hit truck. Aches, headache, sore neck shoulders arm felt like concrete.

I go back next week 2nd shot. Kind dreading it.

I'm sure whether kind mass mental illness plain old stupidity, bizarre doctors working end pandemic armed security nonsense. Maybe people can't/won't get vaccine wear star clothes. know, businesses people exclude society. work around, choose laminate card, could always get second card later date booster. Sure you‚Äôll carry two, least they‚Äôll preserved. knew century ago. Buildings built designed stay warm open windows cross ventilation. it‚Äôs 2021 still prefer living stuffy, windowless, AC reliant buildings. many countries still afraid use word ‚Äúairborne‚Äù year, average person still doesn‚Äôt know virus spreads...

 everyone wore good quality mask correctly (knowing take others outside household), sick people stayed home ventilation widespread, would crushed virus month two without lockdown. Unfortunately, average person cannot understand basic things carefully.

I still see many people pull masks talk, people ‚Äúcareful‚Äù wear masks work take lunch coworkers stuffy room. It‚Äôs rocket science, it‚Äôs frustrating prevented mitigated easily, instead still insist hand washing/hygiene theater ‚Äú6 feet‚Äù. misinformation? Variants come mass amounts infected peoples. giving virus 76 million people bounce around mutate. obviously going happen. seriously doubt anyone requiring masks distancing fall. probably saying anyone makes announcement ending masks gets completely raked coals. Lost father January Covid. Wife miscarriage week later 16 weeks. we‚Äôre Covid positive. Bad luck understatement. shutting everything harming millions people businesses relative handful people can't get vaccine.

Policy best outcome majority, point small minority would harmed reopening normal, keeping mitigation place harms vast majority.

So die unfortunate, something shut down/mandate distancing masking for.

Fortunately likely die since less people sick = resources hospitals focus get sick can't get vaccine. 4/3? 15% people process laminated card? debate there. that‚Äôs OP said. Cool. Thanks. you‚Äôre fully vaccinated care airflow sanitizer? You‚Äôre perfectly safe now! believe vaccines work? New Zealand, Australia, South Korea (kind of) islands way smaller populations US. Much much easier manage something like there. 

The idea US suddenly going change entire political social culture become authoritarian regime restricts people‚Äôs personal movement always fantasy, clung hope say ‚ÄúI told done like X‚Äù living fantasy land detached reality. Problem Texas like 1000s free appointments sitting unused outside cities. expand eligibility use doses up. yet PM announced back school full-time secondary 3-4-5 (equivalent grades 10-11-12), 50-50 remote in-person since Christmas reduce volume students school buildings.

I started pandemic quite happy impressed direction government taking. time passes, find disappointed. get measure make everyone happy, wish opted preventive measures. point others go around saying ""children risk Covid"" - simply true. damage society repeating things like that. Yeah can‚Äôt virtue signal mask compliance.  Who‚Äôs going finance livelihoods reliant tourist dollars Cancun? choice poverty Covid people choose Covid. Lol I'd let doctor direct decision. friend mine took specific anti-anxiety medication. There's much anti-vax crowd tbh, might even 5% population. keen get open borders allow interaction travel again. We've basically open entire pandemic, (in terms businesses lifestyle) cost borders closed countries. 


Because that, everybody board hurrying process, policing anti-vax rare. events/flights able advertise 'vaccination-only' big selling point majority. Idk feels like giving teachers there's still tons 16+ would never able get it. states 16+ even big states like texas little weird. PA old state Texas might why. even requiring faculty staff. people measures created protect. university town requiring vaccines vaccinated don‚Äôt need multi week testing currently do. Lots people acting like things going back normal, see Texas. dont drink more. also dont drink less... Yeah, can't think anything else happens October December may also help explain occurrence. Winter also happens holidays known gathering together Hell no, vaccine good enough keep u getting it, worries anyone else. Wait checking you‚Äôre wearing mask inside car?! Ohio lot free appointments less demand vaccine. Pennsylvania still solid demand current eligibility. Increasing eligibility would lead people fighting amount vaccines appointments. state tracking cases come reporting them. summer large % came offices. healthcare worker passed supposed lack oxygen getting brain due wearing mask day, I'm pretty sure bunch idiots. antivaxxers know would absolutely pass smallpox vaccine. They've even said they'd pass rabies vaccine bitten rabid animal - certain death. Oddly however, they'd OK rabies immunoglobulin. said anything schools enforcing 3 foot rule? 

15 dead Columbine: safety pins, long coats, backpacks, colorful hair banned, tucked shirts name tags enforced, zero tolerance. exceptions! 

2,780,000 dead COVID: can't make put mask, would infringe rights! looking perception. Fair enough, thats answer. idea imagine would difficult create robust system time, im sure useful would near future. theres really nothing stopping cruise ship jabbing j &amp; j someone board, safe People already fully vaccinated. I‚Äôm getting second shot three weeks flying Cabo five weeks. source tells us need start thinking done here.

Deaths 31%....thats insane drop...

Sure today, people acting like summer....thats simply factual.

Hell, recent surge cases even predicted move needle deaths likely done May-June here. absolutely must keeping mind, people aggressively fight restrictions continue need start process phasing helping.... discussions I've seen suggest putting badge ID lanyards sleeve things. Simple, cheap. go it!!! would recommend Florida get first dose, it‚Äôs easy justify giving new card. Even easier get second. Michigan....most folks even eligible next month. I'm still expecting summer fall shot. literally wait one month dish vaccines could‚Äôve started lifting restrictions, nooooooo *now*! fucking stupid thing right finish line. Dude, I'd love get vaccinated. current rate, county everyone vaccinated midwinter. Let's chill moralizing stuff healthy young people actually chance get vaccinated. I‚Äôve vaccinating people last weeks seen people use ziplock bags cards. get kick every time. Way better seeing cards gone hell within matter 21 28 days lol Ya, it‚Äôs really great lately. Manhattan consistently lowest case numbers % positive, highest % vaccinated. Isn‚Äôt around 1500 per day? spreads stochastically, deterministically like influenza. broader publics inability understand made situation worse. people reading absolutely certain true. knows places going decide regards requiring vaccine cards. I'd make photocopy laminate that, keeping original safe place home. I'm socialist unnecessary polarization like this, US full unfortunately. There's sub people try combat polarization externally internally, ""AgainstPolarization"" (can't link subs here). charts seem looking good worldometers...what spike? I'm introvert, I'll never take granted spending time friends again. also want travel within US visit friends live nearby, especially ones kept sane zoom throughout this. absolutely factual. 

It astounds run across someone literally running get vaccinated available. 

My one coworker said getting ""I like needles"". I'm sitting thinking ""I bet like covid shit ton less"". it, disliked lot dislike needles. yeah never ever taking granted kind mass mental illness plain old stupidity

It's text-book mass hysteria.  Lots chains haircut around mask don‚Äôt want wait. local great clips that. 

Now girl need extensive hair stuff done that‚Äôs different story. Interesting. Netherlands almost infections happens situations mask used: private homes workplaces/schools mask mandated. implies normal surgical masks problematic real problem situations mask used. kept asking assistant find girlfriend middle global pandemic. supposed come close contact people outside household! Depends fast vaccinate, less mixing vax unvaccinated community better, she‚Äôs U.K. scientists advocates zero Covid, there‚Äôs wrong many like accepted vaccine way out, already testing preparing booster shots probably That‚Äôs eight people next year, ain‚Äôt wrong won‚Äôt bad thinks. Hopefully someone sees question:

Why I, young healthy person, get covid vaccine? 

I‚Äôve already covid (so whatever long-term effects are, them) I‚Äôm unsure want risk unknown, long-term effects vaccine. Besides contributing herd immunity, reason get it? know it‚Äôs safe? Mexico *can* afford it. I's country ripe corruption self-interest is, part, even profitable.

For example: Mexico stimulus checks (they can't afford them), theynalso refused give tax relief individuals companies. took *months* announce sort labor exemptions COVID, sort benefits companies.

So sure, Government can't afford give money, also allow flexibility companies, workers, adapt exceptional circumstances.

They've also lying severity disease. No, people hooked antivac narrative tend aggressively protect views. Rip ridiculous. you‚Äôre vaccinated, you‚Äôre fine. everyone around vaccinated, even better. stupidity adds fuel conspiracy spewers anti-vax morons. Cut fucking crap. People wildin' like we're back business usual, even even get vaccinated. Posted earlier fully expect small surge month get enough people vaccinated downvotes brigade field day comment like saying something unimaginably horrid. thing is, need get many people willfully ignorant get vaccine. Yelling trusting science isn‚Äôt appealing message people; don‚Äôt care much science things. Telling ‚ÄúHey, get vaccinated normal family Easter/4th July/Christmas, etc.‚Äù much better message it‚Äôs something care about. gave initial supply medical students hospital board trustees Massachusetts. Yea grand scheme things seems like wanted save lives. That's matters imo. Pseudodoctors foreign-funded assault opposition media Youtube social networks successfully seeded ""vaccines cause infertility"" narrative Russia. fake statistics here, aaand voila, people refusing vaccinate. even say rather get COVID vaccinate. actual scientific facts matter. fucking hope. Yeah live Hawaii. what's Brisbane. surveil flu 2019? jamming swab people noses swabbing corpses came back positive flu saying flu death regardless ever else going may contributed death? Probably not, right? probably diagnosed via clinical presentation observation. know, like, bullshit way. way label rona deaths rona deaths via binary practice running swab PCR test saying mere genetic presence virus = cause death. way makes sense going forward.

It seems crazy would risked now, wait 4 months vaccinated attend, oh well, fingers crossed next couple weeks turn super speeder. good, thanks - sure staying safe :) uninformed misinformed 

Trust. The. Damn. Scientists. Already. 

For sake, well everybody else‚Äôs. 

Even ones still choose willfully ignorant... Time round doctors I'd say...fear mongering time willing sacrifice basic liberties. many dying really? People dying everyday Covid, significant factor risk accepted vaccinating vunerable Ah good point makes sense can't speak state state almost every state know spring break occurred think cases going go rapidly giving home testing kits testing maybe reporting much idea downvoted. That's like common sense. People can't social distance high risk. know we'll ever hit 85% - known several people personally refuse take vaccine various propaganda reasons able talk of.  hope get someday though. think we‚Äôre getting aren‚Äôt yet. Looking concerted effort get everyone nursing homes finished vaccine regimens it‚Äôs great see decoupling cases negative outcomes seems effort bang buck (highest age one location). it‚Äôs tough work getting huge % 50 vaccinated. ratio continue decouple think interesting phenomenon 500 deaths day may better paper brutal people people ‚Äúweren‚Äôt supposed die‚Äù That‚Äôs true. December, around 30 percent Americans reported hesitant take vaccine. number fallen around 15 percent recent polls. portion 15 percent ultimately decide get vaccinated. aren‚Äôt hardcore antivaxxers. regular uninformed misinformed people concerns vaccine. ban protests?

First thing parking lot, also made caption search easily. Victoria, Australia, quarantine breach around middle June believe was. Within 2 weeks, went 2 new cases detected community hundred (bear mind, aren‚Äôt total case numbers, DAILY numbers). State government issued stage 3 restrictions, equivalent harshest restrictions countries like states US went for. 

It enough.

We rose 720+ new cases one single day August. reached peak, government went one step implement stage 4 restrictions across city metropolitan areas. Regional areas remained stage 3.

State 4 restrictions basically said go basic supplies, critical work, emergency healthcare (doctor appointments phone already occurring fine stage aspect issue), provide care (legitimate care), escape abusive situations, permitted leave home. significant supports set place people get supplies delivered them, support, mental health services funded well.

Our cases dropped steadily time. exited stage 4 October opening would simply resulted covid cases skyrocketing.

We blocks international arrivals. Countries like US could same; rely less tourism do. choose to, government give shit people enough bear brunt cost lockdown, whereas Victorian economy bounced back almost completely. goes pub

I think found problem. mean, get it, OP stating circumstances changing time may different. assume sun rise day nothing significant changed make us doubt past good predictor future case. 

However, least often past poor predictor future. Look stock returns, weather even health. Time merely incidental. variables matter things. come back case hand, variables, namely vaccinations number recovered, changed dramatically since last wave. stands reason plausible events may play somewhat differently. 

It's guarantee. Nothing ever is. certainly improbable point.  Think used wrong tag, Brisbane far away Europe get. Huh? I‚Äôve one Los Angeles county month now. sad developing situation obvious preventable blows mind. didn‚Äôt know month ago variants would severe, even younger people, although planned ahead. people life either vaccinated point hanging tight get shots. really hope folks outside perspective get thru tenuous time alright. I‚Äôm ready done (I scheduled facial 2 weeks post 2nd shot), know folks trouble trusting process. definitely people Reddit really going issues. It‚Äôs sad really. I‚Äôm sure many dissertations written mental health lasting challenges result pandemic years. ?? Viruses aren‚Äôt ‚Äúalive‚Äù I‚Äôm pretty sure vaccine doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúwork‚Äù way virus. think *not* ridiculous lock people million people couple weeks one case disease, I'm sure tell you. Cases cases cases. fucking casedemic. fuck cares? Vaccination rates rising well. theory cases going down. not, guess vaccines work. Stop little baby bitches accept fact everyone wants scared living life like you. Good them! hear you, logic flipped head. trying inflammatory argue sake arguing. think worth considering.

Everyone's collective actions shape way world moves. COVID classic example. Many people said, ""being friends family amazing thing world. I'm depriving worsening COVID 0.0001% risking going tonight. Even everything perfectly, COVID still spread. what's point?""

Our lifestyle, especially things like international travel, drives climate change. Corporations dumping toxic waste oceans releasing gases air hate polar bears. things facilitate providing products you, consumer, willing give money for.

Obviously distinctions. can't blame someone going grocery store spreading COVID accidentally. People need eat. blame people party crossing country go vacation. can't blame someone running heat winter. blame someone bopping France 2 weeks experience Paris wine country.

That said, also think failed COVID. never rely people, together, deciding reduce 0.0001% contribution problem. Frankly, lockdowns without quick exit strategy (e.g., mass testing/contact tracing) bad idea. many people bound ""fuck it, important change habits for"" attitude. destined fail, written lines every introductory public health book.

With regard climate change, COVID, need both. need everyone limit unnecessary emissions, also need government step create solutions require less sacrifice people hold corporations accountable waste produce unnecessarily.

Given climate change profound impact lives livelihoods billions people probably lead exponentially devastation long term COVID, I'd actually argue holding attitude today significantly worse throwing hands COVID. Yeah, it'll lot harder link early death millions people Bangladesh due food insecurity one person's consistent choices live lifestyle contributes global warming (and US *all* live lifestyles, differing extents). much easier follow line COVID infections label someone murderer. However, connection still exists situations.

If you, specifically, choose take international flights live life emissions, nothing change significantly. never know caused death somewhere, effect individual actions impossible calculate. However, I'd argue every international flight bad, probably much worse, maskless trip grocery store, ""harmless"" 10 person get-together.

We can't solve alone, mean give up. both, make sure voices heard comes time choose leaders help us make better choices default.  received EUA without informed consent, lawful order. Sure, plateauing fraction surge was. Yup I'd say more. Facebook also pretty big boomers. tend easy targets stuff Interestingly saw survey showed 4/5 people UK skeptical vaccine changed minds would get already it. Computers one thing?!? afford pearls, I'm gonna clutch 'em. Gen X hitting mid-fifties now. think realize lamination label makers Boomer invention, one we've determined much work.

FWIW still original SS card, unlaminated, wallet.  Laminate *that*. maybe asymptomatic carriers? early tell. guess problem this. One person deciding go bar pandemic could easily stop someone getting COVID. One person choosing get plane ticket absolutely nothing. number planes fly they'll consume amount fuel generate amount emissions. People able act individually keep people around safe COVID. way harder something like air travel's contribution climate change, way harder hold individual person responsible something like plane polluting environment hold individual responsible spreading COVID.

The real way people stop something scale contributing climate change mass action, nebulous nature threat climate change (with effects gradual, largely externalized onto strangers, hard link individual behavior without consciously thinking it) high difficulty actually developing effective response (sustainable technologies would take far longer implement taken vaccine made distributed), way harder actual get large number people together something like giving flying sake environment. I'm saying right think similar situation COVID, lot people really hard imagine individual choice fly could really anything help improve anyone's lives. didn‚Äôt mask obsess hand sanitizer 2019. Post vaccination go back caring things. certain somebody probably laughing inside Covid-free palace.

Who's laughing Covid-free flattening curve save people‚Äôs lives? Writing bullshit responding claims asshole. refuse take responsibility actions least fucking brain dead trying handwave away.

I hope find peace too, grave, sooner rather later Hospitalizations numbers US whole plateaued. decline ceased. So, source. Yeah think would reached consensus school safety, outdoor gathering, transmission indirect touch on. German here, feel man. IMHO lot bot accounts Facebook too. know, vaccinated recovered.  guess depends are. Los Angeles Country 9k hospitalizations January, 700 now. It‚Äôs different phase pandemic OPs comments spot on. Pretty sure nobody stay home indefinitely. much us might like to. Responding claims isn‚Äôt whataboutism. didn‚Äôt anything wrong following restrictions required law.

Really closely. Alignment somewhat close rest Bay Area similar policy trajectory, though SF started dropping sooner (re-closed indoor restaurants bit sooner).

What think caused 'low baseline'? People spending less time indoors together.

Covid spread really great mystery point. abundant evidence around world: people spending time together indoors, especially extended time unmasked. So: work places, church services, gyms, house parties, restaurants, etc. term ""Vaccine Passport"" seems trigger lot people every time I've seen brought lol.

They tested covid mainly test existed (early Chinese numbers diagnosed symptoms). (in UK) test mid January - based RNA sequences released CDC. 

There also spike excess deaths UK March/April last year - would expected Covid-19 around significant numbers.

Europe going hard? heard what's happening Europe moment? wonder need card? vaccination record promptly lost card. cause vaccinated mean hygiene standards go window. What's problem? literally piece cloth. honestly problem wearing indefinitely going forward. I'm okay extending mandates indefinitely. happened two towns. Urk one could also get J&amp;J shot tradtional vaccine platform 100% efficacy severe illness well. already infected, yes, deny pretty unlikely get again. We've seen variants though, overflow hospitals even sizable chunk infected, like already brazil. I'm means Covid deadly everyone type guy, impossible die get hospitalized even young healthy person. Yes, risk may insignificant, let fear unknown irrationally drive get vaccine. Anyway, that's pretty good summary situation, comment posted response someone's long term vaccine fears would go indepth.

Yes, there's risk vaccine, there's element risk everything. risking life drive vaccination clinic eating mcdonalds burger. end day, however, choosing protecting covid (which vaccine proven 100% effective terms actual illness) taking whatever risks may relatively new mrna technology vs actually getting covid. I'm covid paranoid, understand usually sniffles anyone young long term effects pretty overblown. hundreds millions already got shot ill effect. point, covid far deadly even 25 year old possibility something coming vaccine that's already put hundreds millions arms. Yes, understand fear unknown mrna technology really tested tune like 20 30 years. Thing is, body already makes proteins mrna. body makes mrna ""code"" proteins body needs function. difference body taking mrna using ""code"" proteins train immune system fight covid. Sure, one knows long term effects mrna, like know long term effects internet computers highly doubt 5g nut. logic logic tells us mrna would used proteins made immune system learns fight harmless proteins, passes system well. Testing already proven process vaccine byproducts safe. question later parts. mentioned before, body uses mrna every day make proteins, likelihood functional mrna causing problems *after leaves system* would unprecedented. spike proteins codes harmless, it'd unprecedented cause problems leaves system, mention would system covid anyway except attached something far dangerous. I'm highly skeptical covid long term effects well, exists infinite times evidence covid long term effects mrna long term effects, latter observed longer period time. Anyway, hope convinced risk covid vs vaccines.

TLDR: Everything risk life, covid carries far risk vaccine exhibited signs it. could give shit do. I'm wearing mask. Forever. üò∑ pandemic really brought ugly side people.


The worst part watching friends family members knew years change overnight. People never brought politics sudden saying whatever wanted Facebook. close family members complete denial going on. someone family got really sick acted like always taking seriously. sad. would not? would afraid ""strangers' air""? Stop trying make emergency pandemic measures last longer need to. party pooper I'm really really worried covid go away 2020s. speak deep fear living overpopulated country like India definitely lacks medical infrastructure, vaccination capacity general sense awareness. got hit second wave damn year since started, wonder long take us go back complete normalcy! People readily forget COVID new disease. certainty whether COVID going change. might change much faster like, we're basically guaranteed it'll change. America healthy young. co morbidities get vaccine. Great see Romania Hungary page... think different state state. yeah, fill form.. Basically name address, health questions. definitely never asked id. asked insurance like ""if insurance, that's cool too, ask"". 

But yeah think vaccination cards valid ""travel pass"" whatever. also super easy make one too. Get cardstock hit kinkos whatever, good. There's nothing card thay verifiable far tell. Florida's fault cases downtrending? Jesus. worth taking risk keeping hotspots longer period time. New mutations develop danger us, including us. would result much financial problems. donating also profitable US. fact wouldn‚Äôt even necessary, cause preventing people dying human. god wish could give gold someone explain figures mean exactly? vaccine 98% effective preventing symptomatic infection 97% effective preventing deaths?

I'm assuming I'm reading wrong.. Except Eurovision. Disgraceful risk simple. Economic damage costs lives, lives currently saving lockdown vulnerable vaccinated 1 already vastly reduces deaths offer enligh protection. currently sitting average excess deaths still massively strict lockdown.

It's meant data dates, reality dates. Good luck American people nation's future, seems complete mess atm I‚Äôm quite sure governmebt would love human rights records like China rn . anyone surprised days comes America? Always sort drama silliest things 1/3 = 33.33% Well seems like glory Hotspot new mutations. new mutations might danger us. Distribution vax important us. Book yourself

where? Interesting require ID. second shot accidentally left ID car made go back get it, able get shot without it. vulnerable jump online book doc contacted yet.

In case commenter above, actually can't always that. use NHS booking site GP flagged able so. use automation medical records this, lot time get wrong. Book online where? Yeah. effects underestimated. population NYC *doubles* given weekday, people work city don‚Äôt live it. 

To put perspective, population NYC accounts half population entire state - 9 million/18 million, respectively. offense I'm MD/PhD student halfway PhD immunology straight wrong. flu probably worse virus COVID, introduce brand new virus 80 year old shit gonna go rails. people least partial immunity flu, even get flu shot. flu remains potent deadly mutating many strains. we've done first pass virus, reduced spread, minimized mutation rate, settle equilibrium far flu, especially effective vaccines are.

The vast, vast majority people get COVID vaccine necessary boosters live rest lives never get substantially sick. Mathematically, modeling, lockdowns work really, really well. However, soon add actual humans situation things go well. human rights Europe, like China, could lock people houses prevent transmission. However, year people tired. Kids meeting outside without masks arranging underground parties. People visiting houses eating together.  mRNA tech going change world

Yes, look [BioNTech's they're working many candidates! keep track, going massive piss festival hope stick it. really know EU. US lot supply available argument switching weaker UK strategy ideal country limited supply UK. important note decline cases mostly due relaxing rules months leading Christmas lock starting shortly christmas recently relaxed. referring to? Indeed. acid test vaccine coming next months. opinion still wear mask flue season EU, instance, beginning general consensus portrayed media government statements vaccine passport would last resort policy. Also, discussion dominated concerns incompatibility constitutions, EU law, etcetera. Due sensitive nature possible social inequality/apartheid effects would alledgedly become requisite document. general consensus seems shifted toward ambition make travelling without vaccine passport prohibited among things. Governments also actively advising private companies implement similar system. shows pushing towards limiting personal freedom one want get vaccinated and/or apply vaccine passport. course start talking way earlier but, example, early accusations EU wide plan implement vaccine passport referred social agitation tactics anti-vaxxers sort conspiracy theory. don‚Äôt agree this, experience. 

I understand point. Nonetheless, would like add slight nuance statement. Although possible, businesses general haven‚Äôt done much ‚Äòfiltering‚Äô sense describe last decades, since would counterproductive, heavily limiting sales whatnot. clear exceptions course, believe statistically significant broader picture. course also different levels it: employer might request wear protective shoes dangerous work (required law often avoid claims), bar might refuse drunk person, forth. personal opinion, however, using medical information filter people whole different level. type info available anyone (I know, days info lays street already, must try keep form privacy). Refusal basis person‚Äôs medical status therefore slippery slope according perspective. Thoughts guys. Stay safe. noticed countries (Mexico, Russia Spain example) give ""official"" number deaths ""real"" one worldometers always use first, lowest

Basically countries know precisely many covid deaths had, prefer show lower number... second 3 day lockdown since restrictions initial lockdown eased. life mostly normal. masks necessary usually, businesses open, restaurants, bars, schools open. Best go live life without fear coronavirus.

How compare regular surgical masks? countries well? Surely EU US would moved vaccination plan evidence back up. 

I also evidence yet whether delayed 2nd dose plan gives long term protection long 2nd dose recipients starting receive second dose. funny country like 4 times less vaccined people saying % Europe Personally think need HIV passports bars clubs recklessly fuck impunity. /s  think couple things 1.

2. half adults vaccine, fully immunised

3. much data variants effective vaccine announced plans. Perhaps government leaving margin error (for once)

Ultimately, risk now? We've come far, might well follow plan now. sad, damaged little person are. ""social culture"" mean taught young age selfish prick okay, yeah, sure. 

Also, India, Bangladesh, Japan, list continues. Political pressure ignored, decided leave. Whether would've ignore pressure join vaccine program impossible prove. could print new card write info State'n'Island Yeah, year none true. true even now.

COVID temporarily dangerous. dangerous novel immune systems, anymore. Long-covid real. receive death threats, that's bad inhumane idea. want stoop level.

We want seem bad lockdowns they're enforcing, clearly crimes humanity cause extensive damage almost every aspect society.

Yogurt, people throw yogurt them. ...or pie eggs work too. mean, least they‚Äôre thorough?  weekly report see people got infected. 10% cases caused schools 19% infections caused visits. 

Of course estimate, seeing neighborhood people visiting ever before. Thats despise subreddit rn. Getting laughed vac numbers brits muricans kept themselfes ""I feel like waiting like 2 months everyone get vaccine let's introduce dystopian nightmare system open us easy means discrimination."" Nope EU pay factories orders. private companies fulfilling private orders. 

You know would work tho?

If EU started paying stuff making investments things expecting hand outs. 

Actually would work EU. America almost vaccines know with. 
(We wanna give eu. Enough charity goes there) Oh right get you, talking first lockdown summer. Since thought applicable going now, wayyyy cautious opening up. first lockdown opened much faster without vaccines, dont see going much slower vaccines time. 12 months later finally plan... Yes, heavily influenced China. surprise. won‚Äôt expecting groundbreaking statements report don‚Äôt know already.

In case, fuck Chinese government damage caused. saying society, implies standard across world. However, wonder COVID response people Germany Malaysia etc also received death threats? know answer suspect match US experience. shot lunatic contagious though. Sorry, missed that! agree mate back sources? Thousands day due family visits? 
To understanding much current surge due fact schools reopened sarcastic. Also curfews absolutely joke.

Works you? think there's indication vaccine something wait for, support choice support sort world want live in.

People weird. remember popular comment reddit was, ""I like message, I'll fight tooth nail right say it."" hint danger everyone authoritarian solutions. Arrest lockdown protestors. Vaccine passports go bar. Goddamnit reddit, way get right solution matters!

If like someone's choice, put hard work try convince them. still can't, live decision. could cause unnecessary death, make ballot question. get democratically. Problem nothing compare with. Also might lockdown Netherlands, people basically don‚Äôt care. Plenty maskless family visits causing thousands infections every day. people staying home, would see results. disingenuous comparison. We‚Äôve 10x many covid deaths bad flu year. that‚Äôs extraordinary measures place. It‚Äôs WAY worse flu. Doesn‚Äôt say shouldnt laminate one left behind! they?

It's certainly one factor people seriously underrating impact lockdown still biggest saver lives year. UK single dose vaccination strategy works, great. hope Europe handle pandemic better soon.

You totally dodged every single point made comment replied non-sequitur. Seriously, what's point?

I civil discussion, engaging people agree with. But, like said previous comment, go around calling people anti-maskers disagree them, especially consistently fail actually engage conversation people blanket name-calling. 

Very reasonable people--people complied every single mandate every piece guideline since pandemic began--are disagreeing you.

Wow crazy me. European country lose vaccination booklet way getting information back. Great News! lockdown effective. obese people eligible vaccine long time vaccinated already. states even set BMI requirements 25. Yep, south US, learned people incredibly selfish looking themselves. funny grew NJ/NYC area reputation aggressive rude, response much unified overall caring.

Chinese vaccine well. doesn‚Äôt seem effective countries mass deployed. Cheer London, already dead people better dealing unprecedented situations people think Hmmmm nah Thanks man first shot Pfizer reduces transmission?

Sorry, half-baked study responded \~150 university kids /week hardly qualifies kind ""Science‚Ñ¢"" usually passes muster here. I've seen robust facebook surveys.

AMEN

And focus little things vaccinated people make difference like able see friends family instead focusing everything can't right now. vaccinations change things show people things change individual level well. mean considering almost worked juuls + vapes started taking over, teen drug addiction going also friends fam GA get contacted directly doctor's office. + walkins could really make difference people like dad ""doesn't want drive far"" like perfectly healthy dad like wait line ever !remindme 2 months Diarrhea 40% 1 dose. asked week two ago would like get bigger sample size. gotten vaccine covid symptoms like? registered, eligible starting April 5th. cannot wait get also worried bout bad heard worse covid already. one knows won‚Äôt know probably.

One word: Leadership. go naked right public I'm going get arrested whether law That's socially acceptable government take right naked away. get arrested naked going shiy actually give shit, repeat tire talking points right-wing media tells repeat. vaccinated US screwing basically Americas ""America First"" export ban trying sell ""sending vaccines friends""?

I really thought type nationalist BS would end Biden seems not. young immune Covid. Yes, older people vulnerable, young people still died it. yes, cases among young matter. federal government force Wisconsin raise drinking age 21 withholding highway funding. Federal government forced state something popular state.

The federal government sues states time things do. Voting rights, civil rights, environmental regulations. States prevent municipalities things may popular area. States force municipalities unpopular things greater good state. 

A government always existed institute potentially unpopular policies greater good society. 100% completely normal. nothing wrong way nurse injected you. It‚Äôll painful day 2. Ursula von der leyen Female Hitler. stole UK fishing rights blockading vaccines. ounce decency her. got national football team play qualifying stages World Cup, regularly lose.

If travel countries engage certain activities countries you‚Äôll asked even vaccines - some, like yellow fever thought last lifelong, others like typhoid need ‚Äúrefreshed‚Äù every 3 years. 

In regards mRNA vaccines Covid - booster ideally both, boost immunity protect variants. vaccine stops spread. Anyone saying otherwise deliberate liar point. True. least way learn mistakes. won‚Äôt, everyone who's Covid19 starts keeling right?  .. really seem like big deal me. Basically telling people total dipshits still try exercise least little caution. 

my proposed messaging modification: ""Let's trip dicks finish line."" mean they're going use exclusively people 55-65?

It'll used people 55-64 according article, yes. Thanks understanding antivax. shared opinions downvoted oblivion called antivax rush get vaccine asap. don‚Äôt agree covid endemic, agree vaccines absolutely endgame. everyone region vaccine passed chance vaccine, pandemic region. End story. unironically Lol bad. I've seen way many people lately unironically advocate authoritarian state beyond COVID.

Stop beating around bush. authority mandate masks everywhere, authority count many people backyard wedding party. brutal? 90% efficacy insanely good. spreading misinformation totally misinterpreting source. ""Didn't happen"" ""unlikely"" thing.

There two major pieces evidence proponents zoonotic origin theories (and politically motivated organizations) using lab leak hypothesis.

1. variations RaTg13 dispersed throughout viral genome sequencing Sars-Cov-2.

The problem theory, explains Sars 2 CRISPR coded scratch. fact, theories Sars 2 manmade, recombinant honed gain function.

The obvious issue argument, appearance Sars 2 appears RaTg13 recombined another virus. RaTg13 discovered, mapped, stored WIV. Forest trees.

2. lab leaks leading significant outbreaks rare.

That's literally it. two arguments. no, lab leaks rare. Rarely lead epidemics, highly infectious invisible agents leak laboratory sources time. Yeah disagree there. really despise messaging shift ""masks protect others"" ""masks protect wearer."" degree effectiveness nearly high N95s, IMO everyone truly concerned catching COVID public wearing N95s, cloth masks. seriously doubt that, French banned use 55s two weeks ago yet make statement administration second dose. Good point, remember things guidance always fluid. beginning last week would guessed Redfield would national news saying lab? completely guy runs AZ, uk signed june 2020, 3 months prior EU. UK 3 whole months sort problems supply/production head game. wasn‚Äôt going rush get vaccine fuck it, makes life easier go back work I‚Äôm pretty keen. someone help this? need Georgia resident order get vaccine there? family wouldn‚Äôt mind making trip taking staying them. think misunderstand. agreeing \_you\_ Ruby\_McRidge.

I think laws dumb one follows abolished. government failed us here?

Because former president spent past \*year\* pretending Covid ‚Äúhoax‚Äù , ‚Äújust like flu‚Äù, ‚Äúwill go away like magic‚Äù, ‚Äútotally control‚Äù, ‚Äúwill gone Easter‚Äù etc.

He fired every scientist public health official except Fauci told truth it. even Fauci treading water still gets death threats.

When important public facing US government official US lied ass pandemic nearly year (to everyone Bob Woodward) - set us fail. divided US public, made mask wearing political wedge issue. still consequences echo today.

good stuff fact virus given enough time keep mutating getting worse? People seem forget lucky we've species dealing something covid-19.

I care less vaccine 100% effective I'm wearing mask public staying away people. legit nice get something like common cold cause people filthy animals gotten vaccine yesterday still pain injection site. What's that? Never much pain vaccine I'm starting wonder nurse went deep something agree part, main concern thinking like far many people fail take account COVID contagious least 24 hours week symptoms start present. Additionally, thanks former administration anti-vax community, far people refuse even get vaccine. fear make herd immunity struggle attain simply transmissibility larger necessary pool viral targets.

It's smart people know pay attention numbers science need worry about. village idiots we're trying protect against. counterargument young people didn‚Äôt think saving old people worth shutting world for, convincing health could risk tool get right things. 

That counterargument course garbage though, several reasons. Thank posting this. saw trending Twitter today (which means it‚Äôs getting shared everywhere) really made feel anxious today. kept thinking CDC said it, doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs accurate? didn‚Äôt see anyone contesting Twitter either. wasn‚Äôt came sub see people dismissing pessimistic.

I wish doom gloom type news wasn‚Äôt shared rapidly openly. ESPECIALLY CDC - irresponsible. It‚Äôs like truly want everyone depressed possible, even there‚Äôs light end tunnel. miserable. always insane argument see people say this. Thankfully, people minority. people know wear one protect others (as should, rightfully so) reach threshold sort immunity (\~60-90%), quite literally burn moment deemed mandatory state/federal level, well private establishments (Target, Walmart, Movie Theaters, etc.) 

It's weird deranged call giant babies. Masks seatbelt car. wear clothes store (by far dumbest argument heard ""well, wear shoes store, masks?!) restrictive, prohibit human interaction, uncomfortable, hot... wore paper mask outside weekend (I live LA) 90 degrees valley beyond uncomfortable unsustainable long term. 

I anti-mask pandemic think necessary point, wild suggest people giant babies hating masks?? one vaccinate Thank posting, took quick look find posting see yet.

From announcement additional cases.

 date, cases events reported Canada. However, ongoing international collaboration, Health Canada become aware additional cases events reported Europe. said, UK variant dominant Israel, numbers seem reflect basically efficacy found studies. vaccine simply long enough know yet. know provides complete protection however many months since first person got vaccine. could last 6 months, could last 10 years. That's something we'll find time. UK still lockdown that's another wave.

Israel started vaccinating way variants mattered much now. lot population immune bc vaccines.

I agree needs explicit afraid of. We've really faced need Scientists get better PR folks lol. Walensky flip-flopped this. month ago, saying schools open, teachers instruct person without necessarily vaccinated first. this.

The CDC needs improve messaging. I'm shocked inconsistency messaging (granted, Trump, say anything) inconsistency current administration inexcusable. 

The CDC cautious institution, yes, consistency messaging also important. You‚Äôre making bold claims nothing back up. Give hard data. I‚Äôve seen cases variants high single thousands Florida. Anything speculation. take after. body temp went 4 degrees temp took given shot. Use reference shitty feel 12 hours shot 30 hours shot. Dr. Osterholm right though? Dr. Osterholm always maintained variants going horrible spring. problem Biden Administration listen Dr. Osterholm. seriousness variants idea giving people 1 dose Moderna/Pfizer vaccines CDC director

I wish Brazil gladly take AstraZeneca vaccines. Send here. Thanks. You‚Äôre missing point. People _aren‚Äôt_ vaccinated relaxing precautions prematurely mass vaccination weeks away completion. People fucking stupid song dance we‚Äôve before: things get people mask makes things causes people mask distance less. Seriously we‚Äôve year. People handle weeks masks get mess.

The joke you, her. job help keep people alive get damn vaccinations! So, 3 weeks, cases surging across continental US, recognize may right?

I care cases unless lead hospitalizations Ontario, Canada, government ended harshest lockdown populous city. couple days later, hospital associations said already new wave. People calling hysteria unreasonable. 2 weeks following that, daily case counts doubled match around Christmastime hospitals running ICU capacity.

Your vaccination rate time far currently, especially among vulnerable experts right warn us.

Yes, sometimes they're fearmongering, case here. data shows exactly opposite saying, including data published CDC itself. hit worst?! Dude smoking? know I‚Äôm Internet stranger whose opinion means nothing, know wouldn‚Äôt blame get vaccine. fact, don‚Äôt blame anyone point. need keep train moving. J&amp;J require cold storage hopefully use vaccines get rural people well outside major cities urban centers access cold storage take use pfizer moderna ones. ""but see viable risk real fourth wave US.""

So see rising cases? forth wave already here. Fenway (now moving Hynes Convention center baseball starts) also completely booked weeks  Everything I've read said targeting 12 ups fall since talking childcare assume need younger ones I've heard regarding 6 month-12 years old Pzifer Moderna saying early 2022. I'd love earlier pinning hopes it. hope adults getting vaccinated make big enough difference allow kids return normalcy even without vaccines. I'm aware. hit miss depending community prevalent infection time.

That said, professional respirators effective defending spread even high prevalence environments. tool made widely available. mandatory live?

In Belgium recommended healthcare professionals elderly people. least I‚Äôm it‚Äôs everyone. making stuff up. top incredibly ignorant towards Africa continent. uh huh. right bruh. really wonder much even fool's errand virus prove gain function? supercharged way every generation produces something worse potentially? there's enough data definitively say. 

I understand people take approach know? let's hope best, stakes high. mad lads J&amp;J must really delivered 11 million doses. sites asking sort documentation, like running e-verify. enough documentation get job drive car fine. verifying identity/eligibility legal status. 

Doubt tourists officially allowed while. Johnson Johnson even giving vaccines UK even though UK ordered earlier keeping quiet

Did give vaccines anyone far? ban don‚Äôt know sure, modern medicine much geared towards ‚Äúfirst harm‚Äù taking precedence. smart risk covid still many times risk taking vaccine? It‚Äôs complicated, especially given vaccines eventually options. along obvious cost benefit analysis vaccine vacuum, could incredibly bad governments didn‚Äôt take vaccine side effects seriously given current anti-vaxxer sentiment. Taking steps make public trust governments say vaccine safe may important long term getting jabs arms faster, since can‚Äôt get enough people vaccinated reach herd immunity suffer.

I 100% agree second dose given point though, nothing seems indicate finishing vaccine regiment first dose went fine issue. live Washington. majority initial cases traced back original strain Wuhan. Seattle Flu Study lot work tracing initial outbreak February last year. know that‚Äôs case necessarily case NYC. Yeah, it‚Äôs fact it‚Äôs governments job care get vaccinated not. anybody else know another‚Äôs persons personal information isn‚Äôt readily evident. overreach personal liberties. Since it‚Äôs free widely available disease severely affects small portion population. covid-19 tests necessary give vaccine? done research covid-19 vaccines. covid-19 asymptomatic, probably know unless took test virus. virus showing symptoms, vaccine work properly? amount people 20s 30s say things like overweight/have asthma get COVID die shockingly high Non-American here: assumed Michigan wasn‚Äôt particularly rural, religious red. mistaken? surprising least.

The silver lining China's irresponsibility causing global pandemic they'll experiencing repercussions years come, rest world recovers, since vaccine fucking garbage. DC larger population either already existing states Vermont Wyoming. worth mentioning barely behind Alaska North Dakota act like form punishment, hard wear fking mask?  get one wallet cases attach phone stick there. need trusting others right thing.

This hilarious, thank laugh lol *Brazil entered chat* True patriots./s depends media reports it. true, weeks I've posting stats showing decline.

To fair, though, hospitalizations deaths leveling data. floating right around 1,000 deaths per day slow decline hospitalizations fallen 3% last week. couple weeks ago, decline 15-20% per week.

So no, definitely sort trajectory winter. may impossible us similar surge. seeing signs behavior shifting numbers responding.

The question appetite transmission? 3,000 deaths per day clearly unacceptable, staying locked 200-300 deaths per day seems economically damaging be. what's limit? willing accept steady stream 1,000 deaths per day couple months? willing accept tens thousands long-term cases adults 30s 40s?

It's difficult call, I'm glad I'm one make it. mundo vai atirar vacinas ao Brasil por uma quest√£o de medo, ainda h√° esperan√ßa fact amazon pays twice federal minimum wage. work conditions quite bad- [there even case someone collapsed floor, received help 20 minutes, died, employees instructed return there's lot criticize for, falsehood say currently pay minimum wage. Abort abort. Change brand one realize! got used masks living Korea, Japan right COVID lockdowns happened. makes good sense crowded places winter, viewed common courtesy there. 


Of course got told LITERALLY KILLING NURSES wearing mask first.  know that. colony UK, whatever. can't group 'continental nations' together. I'm sure packing livestock like sardines US nothing outbreaks. 

This China problem. can't wait see breakthroughs we'll see technology unleashed. bright side every crisis. you‚Äôre hesitant get vaccinated might asked show proof vaccinated? get handed card get shot. It‚Äôs crazy conspiracy anything. Get shot, get card, get life. sooner that, sooner over. Portugal here, locked since 15th January currently leaving extended 2nd wave, hopefully vaccinations prevent another one! true flu would spreading right along Covid. Covid airborne, ""kinda airborne"". ordered plenty, AZ failed deliver put procedures place allow export vaccines (like UK/US). first post thread acknowledged PR standpoint bad consequences. 

My objection though based saying disclosing information ""anti-science‚Ñ¢."" 

It may sub-optimal, stupid, counter-productive etc... truthfully disclosing manufacturing details cannot called ""anti-science"" IMO. Excuse ignorance, do. what's percentage people vaccinated London? know long immunity lasts know need yearly vaccines? trying argue wondering heard this. Bad bot Yep although getting vaccine really thing matters UK get third wave considering borders open? Thanks! asking friend COVID January seems think need wait 90 days get vaccine? suppose saying good reason wait, Texas, eligibility opened today, appointments available CVS speak (meaning supply slowly outstripping demand). could Next year? Try 3 months now. city stay locked Covid deaths negative long enough period time undone damage last year. Hopefully somewhere around 2034. Exactly. Re-closing opening incredibly damaging businesses. Imagine restaurant fully restocked fridge perishable foods close again, wasting investment. Better wait sure able stay open long-term. Yes, liability way great institutions. teacher refuses get vaccine one students gets sick transmits risk person, school liable.

I zero patience healthy adults refusing get vaccine. want around people part society, get vaccine.  Well yes... Depending severity, spreads etc. hypothetical situation.

It'd help governments defunded pandemic preparedness teams. Ha! Good one anything wrong. We've safe vacations like couple times last year. anybody gotten sick. 

If understand science, understand risks, safely stuff like outside mostly masked distanced inside. walmart pays $11 hour, 65% increase federal minimum wage ($7.25 hour). i'm reading, mcdonalds fact pay close enough minimum wage (they start $8 hour places) slight exaggeration say pay minimum wage, though still pay bit it.

i'm disagreeing people's financial situation bad, going make highly specific claims like X company pays wage probably make sure right posting. offered, get vaccinated. increases immunity, even already infected severe asthma book yourself:

 certain health conditions high risk get COVID-19 vaccine (as well people clinically extremely vulnerable).  conditions include:  lung conditions (such severe asthma, COPD, bronchiectasis cystic fibrosis) type vaccine shortage US UK expecting

would think European Union gone single strategy then? Big difference wait weeks wait months longer Florida looking land free everyday. That's side effect vaccination. works 4 weeks got jab personally. 4 seconds first country jab, everyone thinks follow rules anymore. think (and hope)in weeks hear much better news Hungary . speaking teenagers preteens (mostly Columbine fallout highschool experience), yes punishment. online classes now, day kids go alternative school convicts Christian school rich kids crazies. nice live 21st century! 

but let's talk child masks second. I've seen things every store, even cartoon characters them. They're available pretty cute actually, that's place I've seen them. Ever. year witnessed one single child age 12 wearing one. Strolling grocery store, playgrounds full, baby strollers park, crying restaurants, even occasional parents wearing mask, every child unprotected. Yes, literally tens millions people have. Beyond incentivizing vaccinations one-off companies requiring it, there's way happens large scale US. political party bases (for separate reasons) government involvement something like absolutely nil. bar?? I‚Äôm hoping idea vaccine passports crashes burns. 

I can‚Äôt trusted hold onto piece paper months years go people are. 

People need trusting others right thing. ferry's nice. 

Just take back again. vaccinated people still vectors? That's understanding.

You've falling victim fear-mongering ""VACCINES STOP SPREAD!!!"" headlines. came out, conclusion know. can't say stop spread don't. However, studies come look promising former. That's wheelhouse believe talk someone charge reschedule, know second dose appointments fairly set stone there's red tape go through. I‚Äôm signed waitlist get vaccine I‚Äôm really struggling wanting get due passport talk. I‚Äôve spent much time social media freaking something say (the passports; still think vaccine good get one; kinda smells fishy). Daily reminder step away snoo‚Äôs Larry. Alright everyone, pack up, there‚Äôs point hope proactive global pandemic. recently recovered COVID might consider waiting get vaccine someone higher risk go first. Natural infection provides immunity well. thinking loud, trying discourage taking it. Remindme! 6 weeks vast majority 22bn can't gone testing 4bn spent. anyway, ignoring basic error, additional contracts, worth ¬£16.2 billion, let 
November 2020 March 2021 (not expenditure falls current fi nancial year)

So that's spot 22bn quoted, given end ¬£15.1 billion made available NHST&amp;T November Spending Review, ¬£12.8 billion (85%) intended testing. includes ¬£5.9 billion laboratories machines, ¬£2.9 billion mass testing ¬£1 billion supplies logistics. 

So 85% 22bn. Welsh one huge success know would probably fix lot issues would feds require states Pay unused vaccines. would incentivize actively pushing vaccination programs. confident however given happen eu country backlash uk chose join EU vaccine effort kerfuffle government going give another excuse anti-vaxxers.

If Catholics concerned, could always follow Pope said take it.

It‚Äôs evangelical Christians use justification ignorance. seen daily numbers new cases Germany right now? reaches figures like 20K day, track trace system cope, regardless good is. thing try mitigate cases restricting movement / gatherings, Germany refuses that. bad, honestly. barely felt injection wait 15 minutes immediately afterwords possible immediate side-effects. next day tightness around injection site kind lethargic, nothing bad--comparable flu shot. I'm awaiting 2nd dose April 7th truthfully I'm little bit nervous one. I've heard people know personally things I've read online 2nd dose seems worse side effects. ‚ÄúCases‚Äù mostly asymptomatic younger people largely irrelevant deaths hospitalizations going think said non-wartime period history. Depends card produced majority ones circulation (I think since early 80s) least security features. Micro text, fluorescent inks, color shifting inks, anti copy patterns, intaglio printing, colorful little dots, spacing font name numbers. That's good article, sort support claim. EU could done US - common practice times crisis - lockdown export vaccinations. paying price that.

I‚Äôm talking outside streets, inside. live San Diego county. Go random downtown district one cities I‚Äôd say half people aren‚Äôt wearing masks walking sidewalks. Oaxaca, EVERYONE outside wearing mask, literally everyone. kind crazy see. happens next year totally different virus comes China? Africa?

Another lockdown? plan, wonder. brazil mutation? travel China banned January 2020 might couple extra months prepare this.

lol America could 4 months prep time still would done nothing. know yet. studies indicate second dose increase length someone immune rather amount protected. giving people single doses advantage getting people vaccinated quickly, cost shorter window immunity. agree reopening aggressively, worth noting 90+% cases Israel UK variant past wave. Thus, think probably see bumpy next weeks getting pretty similar place Israel hit critical vaccine mass. feels weird finally getting something right Tories managed piss away 22B quid test trace system fit purpose,

It might fit purpose first rolled issues now? Seems work quite well tbh. Get result 30 mins fast tests. number want? threw one number said ""let's get we'll talk"". That's arbitrary. That's multiple numbers. numbers NOW? good enough open everything up. Sorry. saw week. opened ton stuff, cases jumped. goals health care community entire time. save lives.

Think moment hard do. Scaling anything 100M+ stupendously difficult.

Yes, wastage. inevitable. materially affect overall trend, ultimate success effort. 

I exceedingly grateful live world effort like even possible. Even 25 years ago not. Ah, see engage lot click bait, sensationalized headlines. believe anxiety surrounding covid amplifying perceive physical effects covid. It‚Äôs largely psychosomatic many. course minority experience post viral illness, isn‚Äôt exactly anything new. Covid isn‚Äôt alien disease effects unlike anything we‚Äôve ever seen, understand quite well. vast majority recover covid couple weeks, minimal complications. Give government extra powers quick give back.

The general emergency laws extended unt October UK.

Who knows why? Time lick door knobs, boys. Got first dose Moderna CVS Virginia yesterday. I'm really impressed well they've set whole thing up, literally 20 minutes, 15 standard precautionary post-vaccine observation period. percentage vaccinated London? Well stop waiting try make appointment himself. feel comfortable young people skipping line taking ""extra"" doses. many 60 year olds waiting email never come? Meanwhile health authorities see low vaccination rates age group assume they're anti-vaxxers move next phase. special? Unlike good news drugs, one passed phase 3 trial shows saves lives. London ranked #3 city surveillance camera. actually pretty good! got cvs brand shortbread cookies strawberry jam inside actually surprised price/quality point. 10/10 would buy again. go back 9th second dose, maybe I'll get more. No. First, good data supporting delayed second shot. Second, data suggested worked best AZ vaccine (AZ = 72% immunity 90 days first shot; Pf = 52% immunity 30 days).

We - recently - epidemiological data Israel suggesting Pf= like 75% immunity 30 days...but real data beyond 30 days. 

Third, type vaccine shortage US UK expecting (and expecting weeks). I‚Äôm vaccinated wearing mask. small chance I‚Äôll get sick, even minuscule chance I‚Äôll get sick enough I‚Äôll need something it.

Allow live life. vaccinated. Fucking relax. People get flu shots stop living lives it. closer zero now. majority people initial immunity, either getting getting vaccinated, frequency critical cases sharply decline. even virus never eradicated, reach point cases recorded year. wonder moron downvotes this... going restrictions lifted young people vaccinated fine.

hopefully??! Yes, guess report really enlightening. Let's wait see CCP want us know origin believe CDC guidance intentionally conservative people vaccinated definitive research available. expect changed soon; underlying science happening real time, CDC historically responded fairly slowly (by design!) avoid unintended consequences, like unvaccinated one-dose-vaccinated people shrugging resuming travel anyway. Technically mandate still on, really bother outdoors anymore there's enforcement. 

We're holiday next week said mask mandate lifted right that. Ypu've offered nothing conversation. risk anything. risks person learning less lost time mental health youth. Slippery slope...have gander see applies statement. Socio-economic issues perspectives much inseparable discussions. Public health already trumps personal liberties. Mask mandates restrictions gatherings upheld legal system proof that.

Once covid vaccines approved children, would really kids congregate back schools without vaccine mandate? We're seeing MIS-C / Kawasaki Disease much greater rates infected children definitely concern. mention single biggest vector infection rest unvaccinated unvaccinatable population.

I would venture guess many, MANY employers require vaccination. probably far greater proportion businesses realize. Nobody wants liability superspreader. outbreaks become increasingly rare traced back specific location event, think Walmart wants get sued one customers spread Covid store? entirely plausible likely businesses require vaccination entry. 

Because this, need infrastructure track vaccination status that's reliable, aka vaccination passport database whatever want call it. virtue signaling, liability protection. second dose increases protection 80% 95%, like first dose that's 0% 80%. Anyway, think usage AZ US gonna thing. Um, misinformed. 

[Covid causing chemo delays even without 

You selfish impatient. experience I've patients family/friends yes, already infected, first shot usually worse terms side effects. really varies person person 'severe' side effects are, even pronounced cases side effects usually resolve within two days! definitely worth presumed longer lasting immunity :) Oh OK, that's population area reasonably sized city. thought had. live near mass vaccine site noted lack line would pass by.

Could site appointment only? mass vaccine site appointment there's significant line. People report less 45 mins vaccine. Sure, tiny fraction people commuting cities commuting 2 hours way city US outside LA. Like percent percent. There's also two options live directly center city live 2 hours away. Shit live Philly still get NYC Acela 90 minutes. drive way Hartford NYC 2-2.5 hours. That's fairly reasonable position take. ESPECIALLY, vaccines remain scarce.. play Trump's statement Mexico sending best Please explain [this Around world, probably US England. üéµThe quid money. world pounds = dollarsüé∂ think elderly Healthcare workers first right. point though, enough fight two fronts work towards middle.

Right now, we're clustering still spread within wide pockets like college aged students. mean, else going say point? 

We've bottomed high rate community spread, spring we're stuck November numbers. probably enough people vaccinated yet stave another spike probably June timeframe. driving everything obvious sense lot folks pretty much behind us.

The bottom line people gonna die folks letting guard down. Maybe 2020 numbers, definitely few. 

So I'm CDC director, I'd say whatever thought might help. might (more likely) might work, worth shot. Lots changes since then! still remember old DLs wyoming highschool less advanced school ID haha around 2000. Oh indeed - lockdown heavy lifting reducing third(?) wave. vaccines hardly started roll point (mid-Jan). yeah agree believe me, i‚Äôm one people.i‚Äôm 23 covid year ago barely symptoms, still though chance get shot jumped immediately knew although i‚Äôd probably safe getting get bonus protection refresh bacci would not, know friends mindset said think study posted somewhere else title isn‚Äôt really accurate. asymptotic infection, words theyre 90% effective preventing transmission, quite close Israelis found, 94%. it‚Äôs interesting. state, 7 day averages new cases deaths November early October levels respectively. time tell trend going going forward. We‚Äôre hovering bit right now. cool guy estimated timeline vaccine available 15 year old? stopped MSc, one things learnt - mine environment based - Nature lot smarter deadly humans ever imagine.

I glad tutorage taught magnificence human race mastery currently planet time ultimately Universe.

Just surprised blows face, dear old Mother Nature slightly different ideas.

And see ebola case - ? that's curveball. Tough shit, there‚Äôs pandemic case weren‚Äôt aware everyone selfish prick. makes sense. office (in Chicago) long term planning hybrid model real estate spun off. interesting see plays downtown/office building districts urban areas (I live 5 miles downtown district). Several countries looking implementing vaccine may disagree already happening. J&amp;J barely got out, need time that. put things context, people 40, severe COVID requires hospitalization, occurs less 2% symptomatic cases. I'm discounting seriousness target metric lifting mitigation strategies negatively impact areas life? That's lie,

1. israel gave full equal vaccination access Arab citizens 18% population. 

2. Israelis white, Jews, larger subdemographic Arab Jews we're expelled Arab countries 40's 60's last century

3. Israel donated 5k vaccines Palestinians vaccinated additional 105k. Giving higher vaccination rates Egyptian Jordanians neighbors.

4. Palestinian authority runs civilian affairs Palestinians including healthcare systems hospitals. ordered Sputnik vaccine got tens thousands doses. come. Here's thing vaccine

If vaccine works afraid take it.

If afraid taking work.

Either way I'm taking it. dunno man. think bigger things worry about. Like, sun rise tomorrow? seen randomized controlled studies this. evidence rise tomorrow. proof. past indicator future. 

/s ‚ÄúCry us fucking river mate‚Äù

You don‚Äôt ever get right protest back. new CDC study, fact got Pfizer shot exactly two weeks ago, means today expect 80% immunity.

Logically accept results, holy shit I'm basically immune now. yet...I still feel hesitant? Like I'll one tiny would still end getting it.

I feel like mental hurdle affect many me, need start really pushing vaccine = freedom. stop shaming people wearing mask - that's reward vaccination. makes sense COVID-19 patient age would drop older people vaccinated. 


- France: Michigan: Brazil:  point, near certainty gamble pay importantly save lot lives.   rich people living live bunkers. 

If feel need irresponsible you, blame rich people. subreddit gotten rails bit lol strains Brazil South Africa still prevalent United States. think there's pretty good chance.  2 months enough time us vaccinate 100M+ new people. well beyond Israel right now. MSM=any news organization doesn‚Äôt say like EXACT reason many, even pro vaccine, reluctant get vaccinated, nonetheless trying get anti vaxxers/those fence get vacinated.  

All accolades said one side mouth (modern science breakthrough, 95% efficacy, etc.) yet side outlining pandemic far many precautions still need take. 

Most people here, sub/forum dedicated virus definitely indicative general population.  portion going hear told remain cautious ever, even vaccinated, reaffirm preconceived MO vaccine worthless. portion get vaccinated, realize efficacy level protection, make risk assessment tell pleading things remain ""the new normal"" go pound sand. got free Acetaminophen toothbrush lol NYC

Lots people without masks neighbor who's living room shares wall bedroom partying friends last nights

Kill :D  Wow Novavax refusing sign eu contract idea! sources? previous employer experimenting WFH pandemic commutes becoming outrageous employees grumbling moving smaller office fewer people offices. 

Before pandemic planning giving people 1day/week WFH seems like they're going 3 office/2 WFH, role would give enough time schedule meetings needed to. cited one dose vaccine reason prefer JnJ. means that, mind, compared favorably vaccines sense. saying ""one done"" mean ""done""? Equally protected two dose vaccines? show second dose saves trouble way okay less protective reason?  goes show many people brainwashed MSM country Depends live go school go guess. kids fine, missed getting such. Aside issues time someone says prevent spread get shouted saying peer reviewed studies assume prevent spread all, insane. woman led many great women. Angela Merkle great leader, Margaret Thatcher, Condoleezza Rice, Hilary Clinton, Kamala Harris, Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Many, many great examples compassionate leaders also fall apart midst battle.
There balance speech cut harm good. Especially posting opinion treating fact, especially given facts absolutely back assertions.

When opinions match experts research field actual data back up, probably stay discussion around worldwide pandemic ""definitely"" something Reasons. Canada interesting. 700k fully vaccinated priority groups getting fully vaccinated. compared everyone else wait 16 weeks second dose Statements like impacting people now. get people vaccinated. People either cautious point. believe mate, thousands wouldn't. sorts people haven‚Äôt vaccinated yet want engage restricted activities mean slope literally slipping front eyes, also objectively bad itself. Vaccine uptake lowest black communities. quickest way exclude black people society currently legal.

Months ago immunity passports vaccine passports daily life ""completely table.""

This entire year ""two week, two months, vaccines, etc..."" Combine government history overextending emergency powers idiotic cheer on. best innocuous innovation minimal effect society. worst fantastic tool government exclude uneducated society.

I want everyone take vaccine too. way. Yeah I'm normal actually see way yet situation

I hate Wow refreshing post region France Strasbourg is, along border Germany. think total population region shy 2mil.  Everything said drivel. nonsense, Victoria hasn‚Äôt ‚Äústuffed up‚Äù NSW 8 hotel quarantine leaks point, ended locking large portion population Christmas last year.

Since July NSW accepting 3000 returned travelers week. time Victoria six week period operating hotel quarantine hotel quarantine leak. NSW one month like Victoria.

It's surprisingly easy hotel quarantine leaks people hotel Vic much scrutinised Hotel quarantine system due aggressive right wing media plain sensationalism, recent leak (all 9 cases total) revamped satisfy screaming headlines, it‚Äôs open again.

The initial Victorian quarantine system independent inquiry found complete debacle first meeting shut down. Five months spent setting system lasted six weeks shutdown. boasting two months later restarted? thats mention Victoria done amazing facing constant pushback do-nothing federal government, washed hands responsibilities towards returning Australians.

The federal government procurement work PPE, testing reagents supplies, vaccines etc. states able focus health response procurement debacle US states endure.

Also, states agreed handle hotel quarantine (lead Dan Andrews). Victoria actually able quarantine number people NSW backlog Australians stuck mustn‚Äôt fall state vs state propaganda makes want believe Vic responsible country‚Äôs abysmal record bringing Aussies home.

It entirely Victoria's fault Victoria culpable it. won't. Probably something Dr Seuss books take airwaves. Yeah I‚Äôm teacher primary teachers students gone weeks now... went teach one classes today informed gone someone class covid funny Conservatives destroying manufacturing vaccines met ""blah blah blah"" Trudeau must raked coals magicking vaccines existence. Sure, that's marxism completely discredited economic model. barely marxists power anywhere world - maybe Cuba handful autocratic holdovers 60s, really dictators want hold onto power. Heck, Chinese even marxist anymore.

There certainly plenty politicians US (including governors) qualify far left terms credible policy choices 21st century. I‚Äôd like right protest vote back please. headline absurd, could easily rephrased ""why denied vaccine still getting sick"" Never take mask Well, back getting started vaccines yet, are, hoping happen. weeks ago everyone said wait weeks. Lots people thread suggesting people wait weeks. Wonder message three weeks check back said it. Pfizer approved 16+ Israel vaccinated 50-60% demographic. Trials Pfizer Moderna 12-16 ongoing results expected within 2 months.

Pfizer recently opened trials 8+, Moderna even younger kids iirc. results end year.

Even younger falls affected, still flue levels above. Nothing bad. should‚Äôve started 17-29 gone up. would‚Äôve wrecked cases. would‚Äôve wrecked deaths hospitalizations. get reasoning starting vulnerable think actually would‚Äôve smarter start least. They‚Äôre main ones spreading Clear, already runs background checks flyers, app called Healthpass vaccine verification. doubt we'll running around physical card airport move forward vax passport, instead something like Healthpass. Like anything else, need doctor/shot provider verify Clear actually got vaccinated.

Source: industry already using godforsaken app. didn‚Äôt happen winters peak that‚Äôs utter bullshit

The rates never get high vaccination well underway want go there. Certain things allowed anyway. Bottomline: really becoming national security issue. People pay attention. Cry us fucking river mate know case. I've riding small apartment Chicago intentions move (and never considered it). Yes, last year unpleasant put mask whenever leave apartment, pros living city almost instantly evaporating last March, reopen, going things cannot get suburbs rural areas enjoy, I've chosen live past 30 years. Also, rode bike went walks whole pandemic, stay home orders never prevented that. people really odd views city life like, even pandemic, people chose live them. people seem chronically incapable adjusting thinking this. selfishly liking new life style think it‚Äôs dying hill. 

The fully vaccinated people spreading Covid talk CDC expert seems like hedging. there‚Äôs ‚Äúproof‚Äù card. states, all, required people received vaccinations register beforehand. information taken make national registry (unless one exists don‚Äôt know - state information transferred national database). me, that‚Äôs logical way verify vaccination required get cruise example. know love cherry pick words clicks?

they know people read

or bother watch whole press conference. observation, even normally mask-compliant corner world *lot* folks decided and/or understand vaccines protect moment get shot.

IMO probably matter tell people point, thing that's going prevent another wave getting shots arms fast possibly can. Okay yes would even close bad last year? won‚Äôt be. agree, people different. Showing emotions detract one's ability good leader. thing constantly held women leadership, ability access emotions strength opinion. JNJ great vaccine. People swear flu vaccines rarely break 40% effectiveness. news everyone thinking vaccine ‚Äúonly‚Äù keeps hospital ‚Äúonly‚Äù keeps alive isn‚Äôt good. JNJ shown less effectiveness symptomatic infection hospitalization death rates slashed almost nothing (most important) Thanks refusing put life hold putting risk life unvaccinated mexican people. Thank much! 2nding this, mine sticker MFG, date, Lot Number Pharmacy. initials game shot. know matter Oxford/AZ tested transmission trials deemed vaccine satisfactory. denied vaccine access communities color.

Communities color trust vaccine. Go black hispanic neighborhood talk people, see yourself. lot businesses realizing ditch one biggest expenses operating business. office space.

The company work Cupertino incredibly expensive offices made sense trying pull local talent pool. now?  There's much reason it. 250 appointments open state ran site rural NY today. Almost 500 tomorrow.

Glad arent going arms today various cities around state fully booked. hey least rollout ""fair""  got first Pfizer today keeping arm moving helps keep sore. went shot hoops half hour offered vaccines underlying health conditions frontline care staff. lot would 55. personally know four people early 20s jab. rare. Estimated 10 15 million people get year although usually severe cause pneumonia though vaccinated symptoms negative, seems likely something else. fever couple weeks ago generally felt crappy, test negative, -- work home, see anyone. 

So knows caught caught know lot easier catch stuff (food, random germs shoe touched forgot wash hands, etc., etc.) COVID see anyone. people waitingists place surplus. like, sheet paper.

We would leave far many people shit luck this. Also that's even looking legal issues national vaccine registry that's accessible company. soon late, always. Fun contingent upon breaking safe guidelines. One great time group, distancing wearing mask. want party like virus exist behaving irresponsibly. Numbers CDC came out. Even one dose Pfizer Moderna give 80% coverage. society built around extroverts make 70+% Americans. That's probably introverts liked changes last year. introvert, I've worked home 5 years changes, dread day might return office make BS small talk people care navigating BS politics workplace. Ah yes reminds early covid days turkey pretended 0 cases although neighboring countries major outbreaks people travelling Turkey confirmed cases almost 2 months absolutely untrue. First: convention center second shots now. Second: walk-ups select zip codes. Third: walk still groups 1a 1b. walk-ups get people priority groups hard hit neighborhoods without access email etc vaccinated. Yeah. second dose mostly autism. think she‚Äôs upset organization‚Äôs fifteen minutes fame coming close. can‚Äôt wait day never hear CDC whoever again. tested long ways away doesn‚Äôt work like poster responding implying. Unlikely tourists. places ask proof address. I've heard second shot meant take anything eight hours get full effect. true? honestly tiring. ""just wait 2 weeks"" catchphrase really work anymore ""just wait variants"". pathetic. logic. Get some. previous hermits (much Reddit crowd) pretty well recently There's better time develop new hobby. Maybe. doctor ran lot tests though adenovirus rare USA? Maybe incompetent... Hospitalizations given total there's data new daily severe cases.

You find data official dashboard: translate bit iffy think good enough. Turns adverse events canada. recommendation entirely based european data. who's going work varify everything that, apparently, every event venue business mad rush reopen?

Also requires people vaccinating keep internal list who's getting bottle. Beyond card get, really anything like that? talking about? NJ already said open everyone later May 1. Yeah, extremely rare first novel case ever really ‚Äútrue‚Äù first case. new pathogen gets noticed first handful people already infected. Exact reaction (minus arm pain), also ceasing 40 hours second dose. haven‚Äôt hearing politicians urging take vaccine it‚Äôs turn?! One first dose Pfizer, one first dose Moderna. way. ways control covid without lockdowns, though. obviously easiest main way, places like South Korea able control spread without really locking down. headline seems fine me. first reaction it‚Äôs great there‚Äôs few. feel like people understand hundreds day one point. r/woooosh Smart move would start boosting supply directly hotspots overwhelm virus vaccinations. okay hopeful! light end tunnel, we're dealing complex issue. Vaccines rolling out, great. However, there's still lot unvaccinated people there. We're still getting data whether vaccinated people spreaders, potential breakthrough various variants amongst vaccinated, etc. Science move fast might like gather analyze data instead jumping conclusions. hang keep taking precautions, vaccine rollouts key getting past this. Sure, might need vaccine booster handle escape variants, sounds it, would far faster develop initial vaccine. UK recommended time period shots 12 weeks maximise number people protection. Given success strategy far, I'd get everyonev 40 vaccinated one shot giving anyone 65s two shots. Hey currently NY (originally here) staying parents temporarily, live work VA non pandemic times. Got vaccine last week NY state site showed passport. banking/brokerage statement NY mailing adress case. Nice job assigning positions someone don‚Äôt know. Maybe take break Internet, it‚Äôs good brain Also voluntary...and places seem keen using kind mandatory varification so, what's point state? need do. hope mild course made full recovery! almost end thing, thankfully. de-stress. seems unlikely timeline although can't 100% rule given know. still think adenovirus (ad7/ad11) would much likely given timeline well known cause pretty bad outbreaks military bases. Enlisted personnel get oral vaccine those. AZ given tons young NHS staff. I'm 20s got offered normally (think lots spares) many friends it. 

Dunno overall figure young people defo UK. people running around unchecked sub. Yes. Messaging changed circumstances obviously better. Good. can't wait states open everyone stop reading line cutters try justify actions. sound convincing anti-masker justifying need wear masks. appears read offscreen script. could saved lot more.

Remember official estimates 70k dead? there's me, still loves Zoom bummed everyone else gave it. Honestly, DeSantis strongly opposed, suddenly really want vaccine passport!

 understand certain people can't get medical reasons - way saying people get vaccinated. I'm petty (just call Petty Crocker). 

Basically, DeSantis it, know would beneficial protect greater good! depends job. separate office home, I'm done work, leave office behind. company another state normally I'd go least 5 times year days work there. actually feel like used see coworkers pretty often.

I work mostly solo communicate Slack day. day flies trying hit deadlines finish projects. last thing need people surrounding me, getting way that. definitely get lot jobs.

Normally, old life, would go socialize people. That's fun way live NYC past year. quite fast, though - recent research UK shown vulnerable people, like cancer patients, may receive protection two doses I'm talking mid 2019. think July August, would look up. strange time horizons keep falling backwards. early april, example, everyone knew started November 2019 WUHAN sure. Good news, paying attention would seen exactly said happen. Also who's going like....check? Even vaccinated go somewhere, person checking going able varify anything. long suspected, CDC announced study today confirms first dose 80% effective preventing infection real world compared 90% two doses.

The numbers *really* matter hospitalizations deaths. Vaccinations likely drive metrics low enough resume normal society within months most. chance happens. reading expect similar Measles outbreaks future. opposed flu Im advocating cutting corners wtf. Im saying everyone shd get shots recommended spacing manufacturer (pfizer moderna, etc) Novavax vaccine approval stand? close submission? even goes beyond many wanting live shut-in perpetuity. 

It's amazing people fit high horse apocalypse bunker, given vitriol I've seen aimed FULLY vaccinated people taking steps putting pandemic behind them. 

I've seen insults like selfish, inconsiderate, stupid, calling people assholes even unnecessarily slinging ignorant unwarranted politically based insults, without even knowledge individual's political affiliation beliefs, someone gotten vaccine planning summer vacation. live mile beach, I've never seen salt levels magnitude.  ""These people"" a.k.a. CDC saying safe hang maskless fully vaccinated family friends now. projecting bullshit contrarian attitude. Can't say surprised. That's exponential growth is, notice late. gotta feeling guys gonna get American vaccines near future. Come July US essentially done. US purchased 300m AstraZeneca vaccines likely never use Thats data az vaccine delaying increases efficacy. Pfizer recommended use study directed Please re-read comment understand point making. Industry matter, lmao Probably not. found friends complete fucking idiots. Maybe find new ones complete fucking idiots party with. 99.5% reduction spread counting 100% population get it, unlikely border lines imposible. Log cool off, clearly getting emotional.  early 2019 talking? earliest person know got virus tested positive antibodies antibody test available someone got sick 3 weeks early December 2019. Obviously clinching proof looks likely.

And lose smell? Same! Yes would possible. politically palatable maybe not, certainly possible. Lol ‚Äúwreaking havoc‚Äù what, mean minuscule (if all) uptick deaths?  No. also already vaccinated. told get test early april beacuse 

A. unreliable

B. late. beginners dose tbh Thank this, going order one doesn‚Äôt mean people evil.

Did article say were?

And article talking organized misinformation campaigns, really criticizing large amount humans basically calling hyenas pack together seek enemies try pester convince otherwise. 

I notice article that. Yes, watching FL Michigan well. could go either way. Worrisome. Yeah Office lol forgot 4 zeros. mean may call joke job.

There limited amount vaccines appointments.

We need maintain orderly exit fire exit. difficult get appointments right now. Artificially culling ""eligible"" helps reduce frustrations crowding  okay vent little? Wife got first pfizer dose middle month. weekend whole family started feeling crappy spiked fevers. coughing runny nose. test negative wife kids pending. COVID I'm annoyed close second dose careful anyone know. literally never go except absolute necessities things delivered. work home kid digital learning. 

If COVID, still wonder hell caught another virus. I'm mostly worried 9 year old daughter. We're hard time keeping temp pediatric inflammatory syndrome top head. Zero deaths cases - still absolutely loads cases. Downside increased risk mutations could (but far haven't) bypass vaccines. take - also long covid still fully understood - two risks take lifting lockdown idea impacts personally. tf would downvote buddy? Switch cell phone billing address parents‚Äô house print new bill arrives. industries like tech might be. need office whatsoever. know saddest thing whole coronavirus situation is? fact virus barely affects children. force distance school plastic cubicles, space lunch allow speak, can't play together share toys. adults pathetic cowards gladly sacrifice well children safety. I'm assuming one cowards.  anyone know anybody got flu year? don‚Äôt understand hard people accept. majority younger people, death worry. worry would long haul symptoms mid-moderate infection, symptoms headaches, myalgia, loss taste smell, etc.

If vaccine likely protect infection, people prefer take it, it‚Äôs bad take. get population level, it‚Äôs likely better faster people get vaccinated vaccine it‚Äôs irrational people prefer wait mRNA so. ""Law Order"" *always* meant locking anti-war Left Black people. tested antibodies? that's guarantee something start stealing Tell Chicago. May 1st rest state April 12th. way hell even half citizens still able locate cards weeks now. early variant Covid19. 

Seems lot folks ~~were~~ guessing.  disturbing say least nobody gives shit creeping, lingering authoritarianism place past year things like this, banning protests (not 'emergency' time)... Things like never temporary. trust government far could throw it. \*live Springfield, Carbondale... International conflict nationalism rise idk Journalists can't catch break. Yeah, want exposed bunch unvaccinated crazy people. University endlessly filters incompetent students semester semester, different? Chicagoan here. husband higher ed eligible March 29, appointments really hard come unless willing drive Carbondale. seems like light switch dimmer. takes 2 weeks go lowest setting gradually turned time period highest efficacy. That's entirely plausible. Late 20s zero, repeat zero, scientific studies saying variants dangerous kids. Countries states posting numbers less meaningless taken scientific evidence...are following science here?

And yes, kids preexisting conditions....but shut distancing protect EVERYONE preexisting condition, we're make sure health care system collapse...with adults vaccinated won't. delayed ships movement due COVID. threat National security military necessary. war everyone would shot. usually misplaced reason tbh. Social media, encourages tiny text posts tiny video clips, exactly encourage bothering understand wider context getting enraged. excited vaccine passport flights!!! last time traveled needed take test 72h flight. I'm looking forward plane everyone vaccinated. think happen. You‚Äôll start seeing regular businesses employees. sports teams it. Colleges vaccination drives students. Etc... like something something biolab
 
But that‚Äôs ok, keep NPC looked ""upper middle class income"" Google that's first thing popped up. drugs already do? Yeh deaths per infected dropped around 3% 1% since vaccine started. Closer 0.5% today‚Äôs figures. 

Could argued without earlier bombardment hospital cases peak it‚Äôs easier hospitals keep fewer number infected people alive however didn‚Äôt witness level drop proportion deaths infected first wave.

The lockdown maybe got infection control seems vaccine bit save people‚Äôs lives. ‚ÄúMass murder‚Äù LOL. Israel donates vaccines PA.

The PA vaccinated neighboring Arab countries.

Israel bad. Note, said ‚Äúexisting variants‚Äù. seemed confirm somehow disagreeing time. 


If next years virus evolves far enough become issue existing vaccines, already technology deal it. won‚Äôt anywhere near problem faced previous year didn‚Äôt tested technology deal it. use Clear Healthpass app.

okay, good know. though figure, requiring people get separate app register convention ... that's nothing, terms discouraging attendance that. people talk opt-out basically saying would take chances covid.

I think would say smallpox though... UK exceptionally well vaccine distribution administration EU far behind, justify Brexit? need watch actual video. 

They hard time getting vaccine (as title implies) rather ""hunting"" vaccines behalf less savvy people, volunteering help get people vaccinated. Meanwhile Canada I'm picking nose thanks Israel

People keep claiming epidemiologists health estimates like aerobic instructor. say 10 more, finish it, say 10 more.

But, so. 

Anyone paying attention last year would know shortest possible trajectory normalcy. despite almost total failure governance nationally everything save vaccines.

It's like scientists told us we'd 10 pushups every day want get fat, banged few, got bored, yelled trainer took zero personal responsibility failings.

Now tantalizingly close done going crash way finish line. weve learned society unrepentantly selfish, deserve immense privilege application healthcare workers scientists.

The goalposts moved tracking spread virus, behavior collectively moves worsening bettering situation.  number likely stop 25 though. Cases Michigan still climbing. would imagine felt could good trying convince people quitting letting MyPillow guy say. guarantee follow model. many people distrusting business wants deal bullshit. numbers sad. read it. find way compare results living pandemic specific effect lockdowns? point deaths reported sundays mondays always significantly lower fewer deaths reported weekend. probably like 80-100 tuesday. yes, things moving right direction. ID expired? Would turn away? president murder people? got one semester person college, fucking one. hope removed comment rude guy replying too. *something something wet markets*

(or something similarly anti-Asian/anti-Chinese) Keep watching CNN, keep fear mongering Doubt different 2019.  seems pretty dam click baitey. articles stated little evidence support Moderna Pfizer less effective variant. Also define vaccine resistant. Moderna/Pfizer 94% effective first strain 91% effective variant ""resistant"". know much Vancouver Sun bode well. LoL have. one things anti-vaxxers/conspiracy theorists tried claim way implement internal passports, etc. 

They called crazy never gonna happen. interesting! know this! really thought behind. Thank you! 4 busy direct. Second dose notably effective general extends variants well. Okay obviously want discussion... Despite posting discussion board.

One thing would add, taking paracetamol actually pretty terrible medicine. reviews underway assess whether actually 'worth it' patients keep taking it. Efficacy pretty poor SAEs produced trials in-depth controlled distant past. blood work done printed results. 

""The test qualitative S/c 0-1.39 negative s/c = 1.4 positive presence igG SARS-COV-2""

Test name 
SARS-COV-2IgG result 1.90 high range 0.00-1.39 Status final. 

Did Covid? Texas like 45th vax per capita never anywhere close leading nation. Maybe better recently, know, would explain rather consistent drop cases hospitalizations.

I heard big cities people still wearing masks. Still, explain Texas' numbers compared places. 

I think weather. Texas one places higher peak daily hospitalizations hot summer months winter. also bump winter storm (granted hard say storm perhaps less people going hospital/getting tested).

If look trajectory cases hospitalizations storm hit extrapolated it, Texas would even better place now, numbers like California. Whatever restrictions lifted probably helped either. certainly impressive accomplishment, would prudent help eradicate disease Africa spawn variant makes current vaccines useless. Got vaccinated today walgreens, asked ID insurance card, fill small separate sheet paper asking made eligible (congregate housing CA, fyi) ask verification. 100 percent alright 1099, chances ask anyway. make sure ID insurance card one, that's 100 percent need. Good luck happy vaccination! People think avoid people going poverty pandemic telling ignore virus. 

Sweden tried soft solution. don‚Äôt gain tons jobs, kill people maybe jobs.  think people broken rules see people honest everything closed definitely made big difference wouldnt wait, never gonna get it. Look one sites search vaccine guarantee find one within week. mean people lying still getting vaccines real issue could actually get one. see many people wearing masks alone cars, they‚Äôre probably never going stop. want choice wear one They‚Äôre not. were, wouldn‚Äôt travel nothing back bullshit.

What call ‚Äúfear based‚Äù consider prudent sensible. point view unacceptably reckless appears rooted ignorance mistaken belief can‚Äôt happen you.

I can. papers full stories regretful covid victims cavalier attitude happened them. 

I issue people gambling safety. cannot allow gamble mine. 19 deaths reported Sunday, known considerably less due reporting death lags weekend. It‚Äôs best look 7 day average instead (though that‚Äôs still dropping considerably!) Somehow, bad feeling one, judging press releases.

But ratio says this: 

The [trial low prevalence mutations, single digits none would give something like handful dozen cases per week trial. Yes rights directly conflict peoples rights die virus unnecessarily spread them, becomes ambiguous.  
 
Journalism directly spreading virus causing mass-deaths, whereas refusing follow basic distancing, wanted speak magic sky man (in 21st century, seriously?), is. Look what‚Äôs happening hospitalizations.

They dropping like rock falling 2% day. 

Cases don‚Äôt mean anything world vaccines. 

Only hospitalizations deaths matter. Oh god! Like every year history world! Wow! Get Moderna Yo guy Ain‚Äôt scientist saying thinks happen, good news Israel showing total infections going since getting 85 % adults vaccinated, looking USA U.K. around 80% give really data can‚Äôt wait inspect fruit longer reasonable live vaccine. present vaccine would call live vaccine. 

Most people say concerned vaccine getting MRNA system. that‚Äôs fear, fear Covid large positive-strand RNA genomes 5' capped 3' polyadenylated. 5'-terminal two-thirds genome contain two open reading frames (ORFs), 1a 1b, together make viral replicase gene encode two large polyproteins processed viral proteases 15-16 nonstructural proteins, involved viral RNA synthesis. ORFs located 3'-terminal one-third genome encode structural accessory proteins expressed set 5' leader-containing subgenomic mRNAs synthesized process called discontinuous transcription. Coronavirus protein synthesis involves cap-dependent translation mechanisms also employs regulatory mechanisms, ribosomal replication known affect cellular translation, involving activation stress-induced signaling pathways, employing viral proteins affect cellular mRNA translation RNA stability. Don‚Äôt forget digital art! worried maimed life, statistics one tracking. every young person died, hundreds thousands became severely ill. outcomes mild cold like illness death. Second shot potentially important lengthen period immunity supposed keep social security card wallet wallet stolen, lead identity theft. keep mine safe birth certificate. Safes also stolen. safes hidden. Taking 3-day hit going heck lot less painful nothing road. Well crisis got go zero waste, made reusable (washable) toilet wipes, using year now. 

So really anyone choose respond crisis. impossible separate figures covid, barely felt hate needles know hate : lockdowns..

 I'll walk coals vaccinated make sure life resunes. Laws theories tested widely accepted yes; one truly say certain it‚Äôs thing. It‚Äôs really mechanism use explain things.

Just there‚Äôs evidence something; doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs true false. make inferences based past knowledge. Like object wings fly. Sometimes wrong; like Ostriches. cases holds true. take data points use working knowledge proven otherwise. checking make sure true. got ‚ÄúUnreported Truths COVID-19‚Äù books, quite good well researched. Ironically, argued health experts trying drag thing get attention; vaccine here, seems like anti-vax messaging. local Office Depot zero employees complying wearing mask got within inches speak grandma. livid. know people issue instead company issue got reminded it. topic whoops took picture mine original home little fire safe. can't think reason would need hard copy daily routines. UUUUGGGGHHHH Meanwhile [Quebec reporting thousands cases believe they're following six feet distance. UK. believe Netherlands Denmark well. ""Stop hanging large groups maskless"" one. (I'm France) here. Outdoor socialising restrictions lift today, know lots neighbours already mingling Saturday ""it's couple days"" Tell school district opening full time person... wish. Cases 15% past 2 Look Germany, even cases rising, deaths dropping. probably massive amount rapid tests leads higher case numbers, ICU beds fine.

Canada taken point extremes, dire predictions, yet fewer 1 1 million people dying day. really equivalent though. Unlike COVID, climate change going away. equivalent situation going bar point rest life potentially threat someone else's health somewhere. reason large number people (including ones unlikely personally affected COVID) given parts normal lives pandemic there's promise stay safe long enough, everything return normal. want judge people giving things forever due climate change, understand why, different situation asking people stupid things year so. Gotcha! Thanks!

I‚Äôm probably going request replacement point don‚Äôt know mine withstand another decades. Maybe time comes government make like drivers licenses plastic instead paper. World Health Organization said last month support making vaccination mandatory international travel cruise lines going require folks vaccinated going make prove it, clue.

At point, really early say implemented who. /r/coronavirus lot shitty anti-vax, anti-mask, anti-lockdown comments mods clean up. also know lot younger people covid figure since young handled covid well natural immunity would enough risk vaccine aren‚Äôt US manufactured Oxford doses sent Mexico Canada then? them, small part. Why? know anyone aversion vaccinated. people? religious thing sort? That's one plus sides UK vaccine rollout - vulnerable jump online book doc contacted yet. Currently also open 50's frontline health workers. 

There talk sight pause starting 40+ group potential supply issues upcoming, Moderns vaccine hitting supply chain right time minimise lag feel like I‚Äôm taking crazy pills vaccine passports issue saying won‚Äôt thing long.

1) vaccines highly effective preventing serious cases. minor cases could little cough.

2) Coronaviruses mutate easily escape vaccines.

3) example vaccine passports Yellow Fever; Southern Hemisphere humid warm climates. didn‚Äôt see SARS-COV-1 passports Ebola, H1N1, granted less serious.


4) world ready put behind us really people stop getting sick and/or dying large numbers, isn‚Äôt anything worry people.

5) US vaccine passports would nothing free travel across state Borders. Gas stations restaurants going check vaccine ids like people buying alcohol. really places primary issues concern. concert sporting event really won‚Äôt change much people meet restaurants tailgates hang anyways.

6) unvaccinated ones taking risks going vaccinated really nothing worry. really that‚Äôs risk take. Kinda like skydiving. choose go skydiving thrill worth perceived risk. They've well too. Pfizer: cumulative incidence curve. diverges around day 11; incubation 5 days means effect day 6.

For J&amp;J like day 15-16: Well, since I'm doctor, listen doctor various type specialists (virology, epidemiology, specialties) invited talk news, people better grasp situation say ""be careful"", ""better safe sorry"", ""we can't give free pass yet, need time assess disease's impact"". I'm willing careful another year two that's need find way deal disease.

Honestly get people think they've outsmarted specialists, even medical field (and like 10+ years training, random 2+ yrs training ""tourist""). duh??? vaccine 100% effective

Shouldn't pharmaceutical companies doctors stop saying vaccines 100% effective preventing death related virus? ~~not~~reliable Razer products? Nah, still are, really part daily life anymore people - younger folks take granted, assume replaced via database necessary. They're something might produce blue moon prove eligibility job fill taxes.

For older folks, physical manifestation benefits held much significance online lookup possible time, IMHO. never post pictures regular basis. latest pic like 5 years old. lol can't go colleges NYC without documentation measles, mumps rubella shots.

So even debate? USA died confirmed Covid  San Francisco died confirmed Covid.

You right that. misread chart looking past 7 days, whole pandemic. However, spikes still align closely rest country impossible show even suggest due one specific local change.

You cannot attribute spike opening/closing restaurants bars matter much personally think feel eyeball measurements. overwhelming evidence still supports idea much larger changes needed throughout whole country make significant impact. SF's success largely due getting early start low baseline, firmly dictated whether restaurants allowed open. Vaccinated people going back normal without reservation. We're vaccinating people high-risk, ask low-risk people continue careful. entire point protect you, let party. way vaccinating low-risk people first (since they're going party anyway).

That said: that's social ethics issue, safety one. Fully vaccinated people interacting safe. countries already major part population vaccinated, like Israel, can't get nightclub without proof vaccination. International Air Transport Association (IATA) said Saturday final phase developing infrastructure passport, could become essential component rebuilding shattered tourism industry. means airlines, countries like UK, others. dropped links three available studies. apologies came bit snippy, ‚Äúvaccine doesn‚Äôt prevent transmission‚Äù new favorite line anti-vaccine people whatever reason seems effective turning people taking vaccine. someone helped orchestrate huge workplace campaign get healthcare workers take vaccine, I‚Äôm kind sensitive hearing verbiage tampers vaccine uptake What? üòÇ Well lie. got shot smoke. Smoking good. I'm proud it. thing trying point people getting shots without actually meeting criteria. friend who's 27 got vax rehab. biggest thing noticed 500 vaccines 437 people. means wasted 63 vaccines. opening things fast. started opening things soon started vaccinating people. WTF. richest nation world can't wait weeks? Fair point lockdowns. really don‚Äôt like he‚Äôs gone vaccine skeptical literally spamming conspiracies ‚ÄúCovid vaccines killing thousands!!!!!‚Äù also trying ‚Äúprove‚Äù Israel actually proving vaccines don‚Äôt work? COVID oil. actually pretty easy get vaccine NYC really want tiny blip medical history. 

The websites say appointments call get basically next day. Decided try look appointment stuff even though can't sign 31st. looks like appointments available Pfizer vaccines. mom got vaccinated recently also Pfizer. really care one get (though would prefer 2 shot ones cuz think new tech/science/whatever neat) wondering decide distribute shots. send x number Pfizer shots one county x number Moderna next? 
Or Moderna JJ popular reason? agree lot takes lockdowns, anti-vax stance pretty annoying Since vaccine approved emergency use, requiring attend college university questioned, especially they're publicly run schools.  Unless really poor health, would stress second mRNA shot. There's pretty good amount data UK find this; here's one people really poor health (e.g. nursing homes) first shot may enough.

Note I'm saying skip matter - stress it. add responses,""china_flu"" first reddit central location, worked move everyone here. England, 50 high risk, entitled go website book vaccine appointments national service, need wait gp mask better. Always. another 2-3 weeks immune response. uk really got gear this. 

I still one concern, affects mum, Pfizer mRNA vaccine still effective doses given 12 weeks part? uk doesn‚Äôt get deliveries second doses time longer?

There studies uk government basically entered people giant study, without asking people‚Äôs consent. love people point 3 countries islands tight border controls standard, like 160 pretty much outcomes collectively fucked up.

Conveniently ignoring people would use evidence lockdown success proof need lockdowns. point covid protocols flatten curve. Curve flattened, clearly need covid protocols. asking surge forged fake documents. 

You're telling movie theatre employee going able notice fine details vaccine card determine real not? 

How fucking stupid people implementing types rules? get news social media, way accurate researched. one knows better algorithm going what. Seriously asking. give example business, employer country requiring it? Europe helping UK early on. EU nothing it. UK contracts private companies. companies fulfilling contracts UK. UK help neighbours UK contracts fullfilled UK pop vaccinated.

EU failed every count vaccination Europe. desperately trying blame someone someone UK (who done nothing faster, smarter, spent money EU) best way handle elimination unvaccinated population. waited 6 cases lockdown would even longer. literally 0 population immunity cannot play around; winter coming get steady spread vaccinations they'll worse place Europe Brazil right now.

How long lockdown? NZ one like 4 days - long enough contact tracers find test everyone might contact. get this? yet see anything announcement thing.  one need document travel? Seriously asking. I've heard place requiring it. Something similar happened California. owner ended removing doors. far ass deep conspiracy theories truly sight behold sad one. Maybe someday learn hate yourself. Agree, however didn‚Äôt help experts telling people masks, wear masks, lots experts downplaying it.

Ok, full year since then, move excuse?  building inside year apart house parents house vaccination clinic week. extremely excited second shot. Well that's positive news once! hope good results confirm things millions people shot.  it‚Äôs really issue college students health. Sounds like waste there's vaccine passport coming around corner. baseball card sleeves might ecstatic countries getting right, I‚Äôm supremely disappointed Canada‚Äôs rollout. 4.97 Million doses, 11.45% population (at least one dose). Schools private businesses guess then. Target give free lunches poor 4th graders too? sure I'm going crazy something reason thought Orlando, yeah could actually see San Diego allowing happen. Boris given hope throughout whole thing?? say ""we"" like speak whole UK. Well realize multiple animal reservoirs correct? there's chance vaccine available high school middle school-age children fall, younger children may still months away vaccination upcoming school year begins.

February, University Oxford announced would begin testing AstraZeneca's vaccine kids teens ages 6 17. Novavax said expects pediatric trials vaccine kick shortly. would masks still required everyone wants vaccine get fully vaccinated fall (which seems likely point)? J&amp;J vaccine transsmission: 

Speaking authority subject unsure bad optics, friend, contributes vaccine hesitancy. Currently they're mainly used sell overhyped technology services. state indication almost guarantee certain areas sites operating **well** capacity. FEMA sites literally zero people lines certain times. operation setup personnel shots going arms, would think would far ethical get shot contributes herd immunity. place giving shots taking away anyone. Especially state MI significant rural areas, bet find place would comfortable getting shot from. places (Israel) they're waiting 3 months.

I think known health issues, sort waste dose vaccinate someone recently infected. Antibody variation increases good time period infection (this random study cited ""In Pipeline"" blog; I'm going find though) waiting could well give better result. certain yet, evidence looks good. Still, statements ""they stop transmission"" ""they completely block transmission"" wrong damage vaccine uptake city. state. We're less open cases slowly creep back up, may car time SDCC comes around. I'm hopeful vaccine us get back normal. also live real world see people acting like we've already gotten back normal we've started vaccinating general public state (i.e. adults fit pre-existing work related condition). antibodies less effective variants . vaccine generates large amount antibodies people, matter much. reason get less antibodies normal vaccine variants may dangerous you.

but estimate? antibody prevalence wave?

&amp;#x200B;

you're suggesting ""first option?""

because offer 3 more.

&amp;#x200B;

\#3 ***immunity generated response previous infection***.

fits nicely chaps Oxford said link.

&amp;#x200B;

**Resurgence COVID-19 Manaus, Brazil, despite high SARS-CoV-2 attack rate could overestimated first wave, population remained herd immunity threshold beginning December, 2020.** scenario, resurgence could explained greater mixing infected susceptible individuals December. 76% estimate past might biased upwards due adjustments observed 52¬∑5% (95% CI 47¬∑6‚Äì57¬∑5) seroprevalence June, 2020, account antibody waning. However, even lower bound confer important population immunity avoid larger outbreak. Furthermore, comparisons blood donors census data showed major difference range demographic mandatory exclusion donors symptoms COVID-19 expected underestimate true population exposure virus. Reanalysis model independent groups help inform best-fitting models antibody waning representativeness blood donors.

**Second**, immunity infection might already begun wane December, 2020, general decrease immune protection SARS-CoV-2 first exposure. Waning anti-nucleocapsid IgG antibody titres observed blood might reflect loss immune protection, although immunity SARS-CoV-2 depends combination B-cell T-cell study UK health-care showed reinfection SARS-CoV-2 uncommon 6 months primary infection. However, SARS-CoV-2 infections Manaus occurred 7‚Äì8 months resurgence January, 2021; longer period covered UK nonetheless suggests waning immunity alone unlikely fully explain recent resurgence. Moreover, population mobility Manaus decreased mid-November, 2020, sharp reduction late December, suggesting behavioural change account resurgence hospitalisations.

***Third******, SARS-CoV-2 lineages might evade immunity generated response previous Three recently detected SARS-CoV-2 lineages (B.1.1.7, B.1.351, P.1), unusually divergent possesses unique constellation mutations potential biological these, two circulating Brazil (B.1.1.7 P.1) one (P.1) detected Manaus Jan 12, One case SARS-CoV-2 reinfection associated P.1 lineage accrued ten unique spike protein mutations, including E484K Moreover, newly classified P.2 lineage (sublineage B.1.128 independently accrued spike E484K mutation) detected several locations Brazil, including P.2 variants E484K mutation detected two people reinfected SARS-CoV-2 in-vitro evidence presence E484K mutation reduces neutralisation polyclonal antibodies convalescent SARS-CoV-2 lineages circulating second wave might higher inherent transmissibility pre-existing lineages circulating Manaus.

Source? ICU beds 80% rising. 

Patients starting flood  reason downvoted. People 50 indeed dying, indeed concerning. thought goal prevent health care system overwhelmed.

Just 2 weeks flatten curve. fact mods removed comment tells need know. aiding distribution. even significant supply longer constraint. goalposts? Schools opening everywhere regardless article says, even stupid it. Literally possible. issue state needs vaccinate them, state going keep close quarters. even ads they're writing mention passports. Either shit journalism setting narrative. understand works right. let go rampant somewhere else chance mutate, making vaccine unable work it. need stop mindset first great. born uganda? cmon say you. parents ever teach others hard? Lol people really trust black market syringe. reason laminate it? didn‚Äôt think important piece paper anyway I'd actually argue *this* oversimplified. I'm saying incorrect, I'm saying attribution winter spike SF opening bars/restaurants without sufficient evidence.

SF rose fell winter right along every city America. aligns days. also fell July-October along every county experienced summer spike.

Is likely SF spiked due bars/restaurants partially open, SF spiked due seasonality increased time spent indoors, like everywhere else country.

We can't answer sure, virtually entire US saw massive increase massive decline cases along exact timeline SF. Saying one specific policy difficult prove, certainly proven easily. Easter 2022 better guess. vaccine heavy lifting here, rightly so. Lockdown ""harsh"" honestly I've seen many people breaking it, joke. work.

I mean, hopefully, deaths we've lockdown last 3 months... think know, sadly. advertising writes CNN lie? think know. still teachers though. Kids take home parents, grand parents, aunts, uncles. schools looking open 5 days week person option next week Michigan coronavirus running rampant. makes zero sense two months school year left, schools constantly either quarantining ton students regularly, shutting school entirely couple weeks time happened since opened 2-3 days week six weeks ago. Yes, supply chain issues: originally planned 21 days. ideal scenario UK wanted.

Rona, wants go bang! [Deaths way, way (over twice many excess deaths normal many states). ICUs running 100% normal indicates able handle inflow patients Jajajajajajaja United Mexican States must old never talk kids lol, graduated last year still got siblings hate online learning. still hang friends say would much prefer see everyday school. Forced socialization better socialization. Ok bad read wrong. 
Still, may seeing community hospitals teaching hospital. object kind domestic vaccine passport. introduced uk, I'm going pub them.

I'm anti vax loon. I've vaccinated. think they're invasion privacy. But, clearly think... disagree I'm providing obvious counterpoint. simple difference different value systems draw line. Everyone know eligible able get well month ago latest. I‚Äôm Oakland County, maybe they‚Äôre prepared counties. wife health care received January. Agreed. reopening heavily coming weeks. Concerned places like CA NYC dragging though... virus didn't, restrictions lockdowns did. that's fucking invasive weird anything. UK literally waiting 12 weeks everyone. Chill completely agree National time. give daily testing numbers, give vaccine numbers. obvious reason looks bad politically govt. Downvoted saying less 1000 deaths good thing lol Gov. Asa Hutchinson week extended eligibility military veterans least 18 years old.

Tough luck, 17-year-old military veterans. H1N1 still exists, talk way anymore treatments better understand much better. make COVID go way H1N1 exists, big deal. every person safe, evaluation costs. hyper specific population issues finding appointment doesnt justify continuing destroy millions peoples livlihoods mental health

UK totally different shit show deal due variant widespread hitting completely unexpectedly, throw legitimate comparison. Italy take seriously beginning along older population, Czechs Hungarians opened way soon. Even countries like Spain got hit hard still better death per 100k. Unless Scandinavian countries, Germany, quite host others (who include France struggling right now) absolutely catastrophic surge, suspect won't, catching U.S. death numbers. LOL, damn nurses need better paid wouldn‚Äôt need microchip side gig income! Again, cases deaths increasing hospitalizations decreasing. I‚Äôm puzzled. Society real dumb lately. It‚Äôs disappointing disturbing. Maybe it‚Äôs education system isn‚Äôt great. seeing result it. Whataboutism doesn‚Äôt apply I‚Äôm describing actual events happened hypotheticals.... 

Anywhoo, appears you‚Äôd rather call asshole make countless assumptions hold dialogue. Cheers! 'Lockdowns work' mRNA vaccines, especially Pfizer, distributed big batches. cold storage requirements open batch divide smaller ones, clock starts ticking need inject within short time frame (couple days think). 

Logistically much easier ship large batches far possible. means single location lots one vaccine given day rather even distribution. people downvoting this? realize means fewer people see right?

Hope everyone called fears health dictatorship tinfoil conspiracism last year real happy themselves. told enabling. Hope bed feels nice. Sounds like Serbia me... disappointing infuriating. Chinese wet markets string pull Beijing.  Historically one many outbreaks sourced SARS, Swine Flu, H1N1, examples.

Why humanity insist learning hard way every single time? Exactly.

I live Romania follow social media well, exact bullshit.

Even workplace, there's 15 people working got vaccine.

Someone said MMR vaccine also increases risk thrombocytopenia (low platelets) lot medicines etc, AZ seems bit different. sAfE rEoPeN sChOoLs Im encouraged kids 12 older might able vaccinated July. consistently seeing age group substantial problem terms transmission schools younger children. course need vaccinate younger children well, sooner take care problematic age groups better mean even lack vacation days deterrent feel like quarantining fun people go week long vacation spend month alone (assuming two 2 week quarantines).

Yes... maybe people going week long vacations right now? literally pandemic know everybody sent death threats researchers medical personnel certain type red cap. Well yes, that's good interpretation it. bad side coin deaths preventable. deaths caused people lax, states lifting restrictions  know why, I'm hungarian, I'll explain.

Because general population Hungary pure simply dumb uneducated.

If would see what's happening Hungarian social media, surprised.

90% comments posts regarding coronavirus, lockdowns vaccines fanatics, racists, covid deniers, anti-vaxxers, anti-lockdowners, horrible, amount utter bullshit misinformation spread social media absolutely astonishing.

That why. Someone throws dead crow incites live crow group (murder) crows attack you. Well, crowed. Many young people obese, overweight, underlying conditions like asthma, pretty common. 

Just you‚Äôre chubby doesn‚Äôt mean can‚Äôt good time beach, people asthma minor conditions, it‚Äôs afterthought life. 

Healthy young people likely aren‚Äôt getting sick many people really good health part live ‚Äúnormal‚Äù lives despite conditions, may even consider risk- likely spring break too, ones catch get severely ill. too!! excited!! Crawl ur bed fool! nonsense, Victoria hasn‚Äôt ‚Äústuffed up‚Äù NSW 8 hotel quarantine leaks point, ended locking large portion population Christmas last year.

Vic much scrutinised Hotel quarantine system due aggressive right wing media plain sensationalism, recent leak (all 9 cases total) revamped satisfy screaming headlines, it‚Äôs open again.

And thats mention Victoria done amazing facing constant pushback do-nothing federal government, washed hands responsibilities towards returning Australians.

You mustn‚Äôt fall state vs state propaganda makes want believe Vic responsible country‚Äôs abysmal record bringing Aussies home. yea ive read studies show previous infection makes first shot usually quite impactful symptom wise. Im curious know tends happen second shot.

Good news immunity someone 2 shots already! always liked quote Mr. Rogers looking helpers times trouble.

How thinking, independent adult find basing political takes Mr fucking Rogers beneath them? completely infantilized. know many really infected. +219 possible cases surveillance right maybe many undetected. Also, said dead ones old comorbidities.

Nonetheless find bit premature authorities declare VOI cause concern long know more. Especially variant behaves differently others, seems SARS like (hopefully also much less contagious SARS). Understandable feel way. feel way myself, logically, cannot make separation. Saying, ""it's going away, fuck I'd love tour wine country"" feels lot like dumping responsibilities next generation. actually cared, we'd restrict sustainable technologies developed, we'd place enormous pressure industry develop technologies (similar government policies placed enormous effort biotech companies make vaccines). Today, true sustainability still particularly good pitch venture capital world. Sustainability marketing gimmick meant sell products people want feel eco-conscious. Fly across country litter Yosemite drinking Klean Kanteen.

Ultimately, priorities. think could easily make argument seeing people, even year, important traveling internationally whole life, convenience car public transit, eating meat instead veggies. could argue opposite say things important personal interaction, I'd disagree you. also make argument climate change much drastically detrimental human race compared COVID worth larger sacrifice. vast majority people earth get luxury traveling internationally anyway. happy without things. think happy without people.

The situations, mind, different, though I'd desperately like believe are. anyone child caught covid school, despite mask wearing?  wish present day mass hysterics fun french people danced couldnt dance anymore also happened 20s. Precisely that. No. You‚Äôll need resident county work there. He‚Äôs gone full anti-vaccine conspiracy theorist. Disappointing agree lockdowns madness. shake head.  tried. None area. studies show anywhere 50% 90%. hard know sure. wear mask. shouldnt risky since outdoors. words Hm. Maybe could get trial know get this? wouldn‚Äôt count that. think might get reprieve summer, come fall/winter, vigilant again. Victoria gone lockdown much sooner instead trying various half measures even asking question. opinion Victorian state government messed response imperfect still vastly better response world offered. yes would. I'd rather part society tries protect cares people society really care. Even lockdowns somehow wrong response, I'd still prefer mistaken society cares society doesn't. I'm hesitant person myself, find facts decide what's best family using information have. say least, much considering everything going on. said I'm open new information be, that's way make choice. last year say I've heard idea truth anymore. 112 days. see you‚Äôre approve submission linking msn.com automatically removed source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

So selection bias detecting towards worse cases.

Sorry buy it. buy going tens thousands cases one year nothing next. theyd prob able write new card.

Guess we'll hold bit longer. emergency use means started later. ramp quickly here.

I wish made exception working hotel quarantine. could vaccinated Jan avoided several leaks had. applaud enormous effort australia. dont think situation comparable. 

1) states america arent allowed close borders
2) australia still island much easier place lockdown america
3) Victoria locked case loads hundreds. time country world first lock down, america way past hundreds cases.
4) americans would never accept strictness australian lockdowns duration. Victoria locked half year strict requirements.

Given early corona started spreading (some evidence america since previous fall), dont think eradication would ever worked america. forget people under-priveleged rural areas limited transportation! kid yourself. people abominable scum, want kind world more. wasting time trying argue ethics morality given situation like this.

It's year ""covid"" already, efficacy alleged vaccine dubious best rates distributed marginal. United States never come close vaccinating anyone, much less half population precious ""herd immunity"".

To fair thought someone defending conspiracy nut put much effort reading post either. business situation government. also basic kitchen table economics business household finances. businesses funds shut whole year survive. Would one targets Corona virus worked though? Targeting specific one nore likely work. 

Having said try develop one alongside. Come on....I looked immunizations decades, discussion showing live normal adult life. know comparison. Many Asian countries kept practice alive 1918 flu. Nothing wrong idea people wear masks go public sick. found article earlier talked California passing bill would track workplace industry spread more, talked workplaces source spread COVID, even narrative promoted public government public health officials. 

Politicians care emphasizing workplace spread convenient scapegoat blaming social gatherings ""sole"" source COVID spread, allowed play hardball companies corporations avoid difficult discussions (in eyes) would come it.

Not denying major spread social gatherings, easy see people like Newsom Garcetti would emphasize social gatherings source major spread it'd allow get hard businesses corporations, thus make job easier. Pennsylvania average vaccine administration though. demand current groups still strong.

Until excess vaccines state, really make sense increase eligibility. want ignore different perspectives?

You literally want avoid people disagreeing like lockdowns somehow correct default anyone disagrees automatically promoting misinformation. believe government enforced lockdowns immoral doesn‚Äôt mean oppose facts. vulnerable people vaccinated. vaccinate vulnerable time rapidly reducing rates spread mass vaccinations, risks much lower. chances 30 year old dying 1/10 chances 60 year old dying. point risks indefinite school business closures outweigh benefits. every ‚Äúscary‚Äù law since become permanent? parents 50 diabetes still eligible get vaccine. We're pretending states vaccination rates that's true. much higher vaccination rate high risk patients vaccinated, we're end yet. People need chill couple months. know think clever realize shitty people regularly say that? you‚Äôre saying government restrictions widespread mask wearing among general public can‚Äôt stop general spread seasonal airborne respiratory virus. Huh. aware vaccine within year virus rarely kills young people exactly ""plague Inc easy"" right? go back much ignorant science wonder made different decisions?

Why make roads differently cars? would expect hospitalizations decrease vaccinated vulnerable first. said, would expect faster decrease seeing.  Deaths plateaued bit, something keep eye on. Considering UK already taken 10 million vaccine doses EU needs supply continue, spare 3.7 million vaccine doses come from? NO. shots take time take effect. body needs build soldiers pattern got shot. expansion stupid super specific, matter. maxed supply, demand.

So result ‚Äúnormal‚Äù horizon, despite articles like couldn‚Äôt hurt getting vaccine that‚Äôs sure. made year couple weeks mass antibodies get Covid. bad luck Findings
‚Ä¢ half (52.5%) people study already received least one dose Covid-19 vaccine. Vaccine hesitancy appears improved substantially since autumn, around 1 5 (21.6%) hesitant changed minds ‚Äòvery unlikely‚Äô autumn 2020 ‚Äòvery likely‚Äô receive vaccine March 2021. Similarly, 1 3 (32.6%) reported ‚Äòvery unlikely‚Äô receive vaccine last autumn already least one dose. also increases Covid-19 vaccine hesitancy; fewer 1% people ‚Äòvery likely‚Äô get vaccine last autumn ‚Äòvery unlikely‚Äô so.
‚Ä¢ time, many people expressed strong vaccine hesitancy autumn 2020 shown little change reluctance Covid-19 vaccine. noticeable young adults (ages 18-29), nearly 1 3 (29.2%) age group expressed strong vaccine hesitancy (‚Äòvery unlikely‚Äô) remaining so. adults ages 30-59, proportion 18.5%, whilst older adults, 21.5%.

‚Ä¢ number people said getting ‚Äòvery poor‚Äô sleep quality increased 5.4% autumn 2020 10.1% start new year, although appears decreasing. People lower household incomes, mental physical health condition, people lower levels education, ethnic minority backgrounds reported ‚Äòvery poor‚Äô sleep quality.
‚Ä¢ Stress catching Covid-19 becoming seriously ill decreased substantially since end 2020 lower ever been, fewer 1 3 people (28.7%) reporting worried. decreases consistent adults age 30. Although worries obtaining sufficient food decreased course latest lockdown, concern still affecting 1 10 people.
‚Ä¢ Around one four people consistently reported concerned finances since start new year. concerns remain highest amongst adults working age (18-59 years), 1 3 age group worried finances (18-29 years: 32.7% 30-59 years: 34.7%). Unemployment financial stress still higher living children compared live children.
‚Ä¢ Confidence central government handle Covid-19 pandemic continued increase since start year England. However, levels remain noticeably lower England devolved nations.
‚Ä¢ Majority compliance continues reported around 96% people. Although complete compliance (no bending rules) decreased somewhat since start year, still comparable start latest lockdown (January 2021).
‚Ä¢ Levels anxiety similar autumn, depression levels comparable end first lockdown May 2020. Life satisfaction increasing since start new year across demographic groups comparable summer 2020. exception trend amongst people living children. Life satisfaction decreasing past month group, coincided ending home schooling return school families. Rutgers University announced students required receive COVID vaccine attend in-person classes fall (say want mandating vaccines), even everyone vaccinated still required wear masks, social distance, get tested every week. I‚Äôm one thinks going way far, I? I‚Äôve onboard keeping precautions place vaccines still rolled out, everyone offered vaccine long start school year, still restrictions? kind stuff makes people believe conspiracy theories. said looks like used doses planned round 2. Ofc doses identical contain microchip, get sure /s students. People never previously mentally ill struggling mental health issues. people like already struggling diagnosed, suffered even further. went mostly stable losing progress pandemic hit. I'm now, year later, getting back mostly stable. 31 year old healthy person, mental health much threat life COVID, one seems care. Kids fine. vaccinated point.

Sure, passports way go. thing get anti-vaxers get thier jab end thing. no, failing didnt sufficient emergency fund Well, another way say said this: know much would hurt hit head hammer, I'm willing experiment satisfy curiosity strangers. need stop making sense. need dystopic projections. shows complete disdain American worker/citizen multiple levels 

Ah, yes. showed us. years R policy unfriendly workers rights, corporate welfare pervades system. Fantastic - start licking door handles right away! appointments pretty much fully booked CT too? 

Increasing eligiblity vaccines really prove well state doing. 

The demand states extremely high reason Massachusetts increased eligibility demand first groups still higher supply. doubt never part CAKE Yeah picked that. I've enough drink tonight usual filter lack giving damn turned lol. Explain world prior vaccinating polio small pox - come people travelled lived? possible? diseases much worse covid.

Trying things 'fairly', emotion pragmatics.  want needs done right seems Brasil that.

I'm also surprised talk setting taskforce go help vaccinate (again aware of). personnel logistical experience etc, US, UK Israel would surely beneficial countries move things quicker. statement Kids 0 percent risk covid. factually inaccurate untrue. Sorry can't handle truth. statement Kids 0 percent risk covid. factually inaccurate untrue. Yeah too. I‚Äôve norovirus many times (none cruise). Eventually, probably sooner rather later, going hit wall supply outstrips demand. yet sure ever average 3.4 million shots day (but would nice) didn‚Äôt say course know serious? Polio waaaaay worse covid world went normal. way psychological think. sure fucking hope keep mouth shut classy. spilling tea 'lol number funny' two hours earlier calling starvation genocide 200 million people. Correct. give pause? concerned mutation helps virus spread faster shown evade antibodies different variants.  Information emerging daily. need information make blanket statements decades immunity effective one vaccine one variant one study is. Easy! pretend test it. I'm going try pfizer self, still crap shoot. need show videos people getting interviews afterwards showing alright. 

There's bunch work already said would get cuz ""our family that"". That's crazy irresponsible. I've cruises good time. horrific outbreaks got media attention dissuade going again. said, pretty dumb take medical advice corporation whose next quarter profits depend something actual medical experts say risky right now. Everyone fighting jobs. mention financial fallout possible bankruptcy failed business. Businesses failing government told fail.  got mine ran cards full size paper copy. sure wallet size laminated card would much, kudos Staples getting loads free advertising people stores offer. heavy misinformation dangerous. Saving people‚Äôs lives...  Test says yes.

When say ‚Äúqualitative‚Äù means it‚Äôs yes/no answer.  It‚Äôs numerical/quantitative test result 4 twice much result 2.

So anything 1.4 yes.  got 1.9.

I idea accurate specific test/company is. there‚Äôs always chance it‚Äôs wrong (even perfect test screwed human error).  it‚Äôs definitely saying antibodies covid.  It‚Äôs probably right. PA fine terms doses administered. behind announcing date adults eligible. Multiple states lower percentage people vaccinated announced opening all, open already (including ohio). whooshing way exchange, man. guy simply tossing usual bullshit suggested Party Responsibility‚Ñ¢ struggling Americans since party want receiving assistance government. top load plastic instead laminating. position guesstimate, would ballpark figure traditional approval granted? anti-vaxxers fringe right want spin yet another controversy. First masks, proof vaccination.   DOL health cards often come wallet sized either, idiotic considering wr carry th us 250 days year easy no. Why? people care. mass vaccination occurs, know won't.

So asking ticket agent suddenly give shit vaccination? don't? like states going make mandatory risk PR clusterfuck, already signaled that's plan.

So happens one cares? say care guarantee bar restaurant going checking vaccine cards.

On top that, useful what, 2 months USA? Vaccine passports longterm ridiculously unnecessary seem ton popular support either.

How this: get ready international travel, focus hard herd immunity even care? guarantee lot people going give shit listen mandated localized vaccine passport. podcast? India huge private medical sector handle 7mn/day. India wasted months allowing access private sector. That's point I'm making. 
 many jabs getting wasted bc government opened vaccines 65. coupled general distrust public (which result poor leadership) led India's absymal vaccination numbers. It‚Äôs bit relevant terms dropping restrictions every time, generally agree since that‚Äôs discussion Swing Georgia too. Open ‚Äúnormal‚Äù it‚Äôs good. Even COULD get real vaccine (which can't), saline solution much cheaper. Lockdowns work! Live nyc, Cuomo fucking dirtbag major part nyc getting slammed early

New York State whole deaths per capita Florida. corrected say cases, frankely don‚Äôt give rats ass cases. governor allows upstate higher spread rates cases months drastically open NYC sacrificed restaurants arts year held ludicrous standards PR machine

The guy wrote book beating covid point hs far worst metrics state. Cuomo wrote book covid summer. scandals much dirtbag is, laxes restrictions every time distract. It‚Äôs absolutly insane people still defend past year

The government also publishes figures deaths covid appears death certificate. numbers higher also include people died 28 days died covid without testing positive. Richmond made quite turnaround!    
and Martinez rated one safest cities California

Pittsburg Antioch however still fit description

also, happy cake day obvious people keep bringing really care looking excuse make changes lifestyle. always thought society dumb case hate validated belief. Good....

Fuck‚Äôem. 

I understand times tough businesses fucking suffer government gave shaft. doesn‚Äôt entitle act like piece shit.  remember like decade ago family telling never live richmond, pretty swank lol. glad getting it, hoping alameda soon (though im already fully vaxxed) Go lockdown skeptic rightwing conspiracy sub Reddit find Reddit Nothing much changed. even vaccines stopped hospitalizations plateauing, soon rise cases continue rise exponentially. idea either still business. yeah general Bay going income- long ago Richmond super shady, gentrified hell back. Much contra-costa changed much especially get Antioch. rich people moved mean many residents poorer side, especially traditional communities. bay standards contra-costa low-middle. nationally bay counties there. Many people said, ""being friends family amazing thing world. I'm depriving worsening COVID 0.0001% risking going tonight. Even everything perfectly, COVID still spread. what's point?""



So, point taken here, real question becomes whether numbers actually comparable. Like, COVID example, issue risk immediate circle spreading (ignoring secondary effects people infected infected) already pretty high.

I looked actual carbon cost international travel. number far worse imagined, means depends frame it. negative take return flight London San Francisco emits around 5.5 tonnes CO2 equivalent (CO2e) per person ‚Äì twice emissions produced family car year, half average carbon footprint someone living Britain. Even return flight London Berlin emits around 0.6 tonnes CO2e ‚Äì three times emissions saved year 

So that's pretty bad, individual basis. Forget good work biking office.

OTOH, 5% global warming (CO2 + water vapor) comes aviation. seems US, 100 million passengers international flights. Let's say globally number 1 billion. So, abstaining flying, put estimate impact flying something order 1 20 billion (ignores aviation transports good, non-commercial aviation, etc). So, clearly impact small. disagree However, I'd argue every international flight bad, probably much worse, maskless trip grocery store, ""harmless"" 10 person get-together

In absolute terms, case. 10 person get together far likely cause measurable harm people around you. Abstaining decision might actually save lives. Even think scale climate change big contribution 1:20 billion per flight actually large damage, bigger point proportional way, i.e. aviation global warming contribution 5%, got rid 95%, like we'd still 5% damages. part, problem would solved. That's say emphasis putting energy structural reforms (which may change aviation industry!), rather putting onus individuals.

Meanwhile, benefit flying, way there's benefit small dinner party 10 people. dinner party, risk concentrated, whereas flying really root Corporations dumping toxic waste oceans releasing gases air hate polar bears

Correct. But, way effect systemic change make can't dump toxic wastes, expensive (via carbon taxes) illegal (via regulations) release greenhouse gases. That, turn, make us consumers forced make climate-wise decisions, want system we've created clean first place. mind policy ends making pay additional $300 carbon taxes regulations means airplanes retrofitted solar something.

Again, get coming from. live car-free reason, I'm trying muster willpower go vegetarian reason. People best can. But, tradeoffs decisions. ultimately, think change needs come top.

(BTW appreciate conversation. caused re-evaluate feel traveling abroad, even plan abstain entirely like you.) People need seriously reevaluate term ‚Äúrisk factor.‚Äù Doctors loosely using terms years various levels harm, covid shown dangerous discuss risk cohabiting issues without discussion specific level risk involved

Think checklist broad things like ‚Äúheart problems‚Äù ‚Äúhistory family illness.‚Äù One person might one uncle cancer another might 10 family members, would listed falling family risk. Normally it‚Äôs jot issue given discuss a. Doctor matters; covid risk understanding massive scale that‚Äôs obviously feasible

Things like smoking overweight increase risk severe covid death it‚Äôs comparable immunity compromised people elderly. Levels risk important. That‚Äôs Americans vastly overestimate personal IFR risk

Just medical issue that‚Äôs risk factor doesn‚Äôt mean lumped specific high risks. overweight overall hurt bodies immune system it‚Äôs impact massive majority illness even though impact it. goes millions medical quirks have

Fuck bullshit, government beyond incompetent specifically think something abruptly started beginning October abruptly ended halfway December, San Francisco particular?

Daily high temperatures mostly 70s 80s time, like rest year SF.

Holidays sprinkled around after, obvious abrupt holiday-specific data changes (other reporting troughs/spikes, artificial, comparable weekend/weekday data reporting cycles).

Public schools SF stayed closed throughout. obvious change people's travel behavior matches time frame. actual unit isn‚Äòt much less funny btw believe ‚Äûarbitrary‚Äú units per ml Boards US advising situation US, U.K. Different situations terms infection rate, lockdowns supply chains. 

There also huge public health gain giving twice many people dose confers bulk protection, especially country hit intensely UK December/January.

It‚Äôs pity ended wrong side history one position make positive change country mankind decided bow villains power. serious question...? UK - Flair Europe huh?
Here germany still vaccinate slowly.. makes jealous. think general population ***most*** countries intelligent.

Even highly advanced like Sweden top 30 infected countries earth, government citizens made vital mistakes beginning.. end laminating make sure make copy laminate copy diabetes alone isn‚Äôt actually massive risk.

If diabetes major factor people 50s would see disproportionate deaths among diabetes groups cross comparing age groups

People really missing fact covid serverity deaths ludicrously stratified immunocompromised extreme elderly

Please don‚Äôt take demeaning understand concern parents, need adjust narratives ailments make high risk covid

Diabetes major impact covid fatality severity. ‚ÄúRisk factors‚Äù misleading term catch anything. slightly displayed aortic valve. technically heart risk factor things like excercise cardiologist based family history, told it‚Äôs risk factor negligible monitor it

We see risk factor bias lot covid. Severity death rates change drastically among people basically immune system old. 50 year olds diabetes high risk terms ifr rates all. never end. Central Florida checking in. thought pandemic completely last fall. /s

We great initial lock down. tourists started showing up. Restaurants capacity, stores packed gills. wear masks distance. work theme park medical leave 3 months (non covid related). one bit upset this, care much money loose. going hide house hopefully get shots go back work. strong populist leader start this... **joint** WHO-China **study** origins researchers proposed research every area *except lab leak hypothesis*.

Seems legit. Yeah book mate. got vaccine 6th due severe mental illness (the risk cardiovascular illnesses oddly enough.) mate issues contacted booked online managed get one week :) Meanwhile Australia one best chances living post covid world vaccinated like 3 people.

Well gee would guessed it? zero covid restrictions USA nowadays work hospital‚Äôs Covid ICU. *definitely* feels different compared last year, especially late summer/winter. still Covid cases units still full/nearly full, feel like we‚Äôve less deaths recently. People Covid vents still incredibly sick. rapid response cases Covid step units throughout hospital come us don‚Äôt feel severe. people need little bit oxygen time, maybe BiPap blood pressor. aren‚Äôt immediately intubated anymore. People theorizing scenarios people looking everyday actually clinically high risk, unable find vaccines bad practice

States opened vaccines uptake level among previous high risk groups dropped drastically plateauing due rising cases. cases continue rise exponentially, plateau hospitalization also cause rise hospitalization despite vaccines. already happening states.  issue covid deaths metric normalcy alone.

The issue pretending like magical places pre covid normalcy back. using belittle nations whole world shook covid different degrees Hello there! mind asking, second shot go since then?

Heres fairly balanced bit reading you..

Let‚Äôs say ends permanent. think let‚Äôs say does. care? would make life worse? population, adults only. fundamental contradiction US response. going tell everyone stay home force businesses shut down, kind assistance. Otherwise people left nothing. helping vaccinate rest world's vulnerable, waste healthy young citizens. global pandemic want save lives right? Frankly I'm going big events unless feel safe events. Vaccines no. safety determined vaccination status well current level community spread.

I need anyone adding additional layers security expense privacy. Here's fairly balanced bit reading you. [How UK gained edge AstraZeneca‚Äôs vaccine commitments ‚Äì struck coordinated whole world response.

Don't give government weirdly flexible, highly manipulable power platforms used citizens basically will, especially ways discriminate education, race, class, say, ""well follow intent done them.""

My husband‚Äôs elderly (85+) grandparents got appointments first dose. virus gone never will, new flu.

It spun way suits international governments global economy so.

It like HIV - people behave dangerous ways believe magic pill get cure it, find hard way isn't.

Although argue antiviral blocks 72 hours pass sort is.

The lie go 100k capacity stadium safe exposed people catch it.

The explanation mean risk eliminated, meant reduced, phrased way misunderstood.

Someone somewhere sat room worked much average person would cost die Covid, loss economic worth.

They worked much would cost economy keep alive requirements would take.

And came loss gain, decide 'safe' do.

Just bear mind - dying virus bad, surviving debilitated rest life is. Right trillion USD (yes 1 million x $1 million) COVID relief enough afford print gosh dang laminated cards wouldnt really, UK would immense political pressure still EU go along EU procurement plans. country EU could gone done alone, many chose so? mom 80 got immunity old fashioned way measles, mumps, whooping cough, rubella, hepatitis A, chicken pox scarlet fever.

Cries French getting ready new lockdown Yes, people started protest since saturday Romania new lockdowns imposed cities reached 4/1000 7/1000 infection rate.

I find really funny, they're literally streets shouting misinformation.

How dumb be. [Se llora en espa√±ol] time mass events ask vaccination proof accept entrance. way get young irresponsible ""the virus isnt gonna anything me"" get vaccinated Finally someone said  God hope you‚Äôre right bronchitis recently? Might why. used get bronchitis asthma needed steriods, I'm duo inhaler happened years I've changed Drs since. think really GP though, might gone flagged everyone difficulties like bronchitis. Dude fuck, exactly happened ""People help out"" political position ALL. 

This even basic morals, literally cornerstone human society development. Hell, collaborative behavior allowed us evolve apes people.

People refuse help others political renegades, less chimpanzees. Meanwhile Merkels advisors largely proponents various degrees ""NoCovid"" ""ZeroCovid"" strategies. Yes. Poland, really hard find sane comments posts regarding covid. seen streets also proving point. agree almost this. Trying enact mass change individual behavioral changes lost cause.

COVID prime example. failed make COVID safe behaviors *default* behaviors. Instead, kept society asked people kindly COVID safe. largely told public health officials fuck actions (even ones nominally supported efforts). Frankly, bad policy. Much like desperately need regulate businesses build sustainable infrastructure, needed regulate interactions intensely short time transition something eases burden people (i.e., ""get test week listen contact tracers"" instead ""close business shun family year"").

Where disagree bigger impact COVID. US, came together try save ~1/330th life (~1 million American deaths). Ultimately saved less 1/600th each, that's even debatable. Yeah effects seem obvious play scenarios head, make concrete reality. really hard imagine contributing one ten millionth pollution leads mass food shortage Bangladesh 20 years kills 100,000 people, but... there.

Then might say, ""but international travel 5%,"" say, ""and going grocery store way less 5% COVID. Every individual party tiny, tiny percentage COVID spread. parties spread 0 COVID. mean participate parties.""

Ultimately, instilling culture sustainability around part solution. never accomplished individuals choosing right thing, individuals choosing right thing starts. normalizes idea could someone comes along who's brave enough try lead us group.

Also, giving much credit. sustainable. ride bike work car. I'm ""vegetarian"". decorated whole apartment stuff GoodWill. Frankly I'm grad school broke international travel (or even domestic) even wanted to. However, I'm human. start working crazy hours, least year, I've gone week two eating meat make things easy ensure I'm actually getting calories. I've traveled internationally twice visit family, bet I'll die. rent car get city pretty often. Order things need. Etc... I'm trying grandstand morally superior.

I'm pointing inconvenient logical conclusion stems everything we've done COVID. new philosophy, collectivism sake saving lives convenience, would path, things like international flights pleasure would among obvious places start, knowing transitioning government-mandated solutions would way truly succeed long term. That's interesting. Holland still locked-down? odd numbers lockdown drop return pre-lockdown figures.

The UK locked-down December remains locked-down. numbers lockdown initially increased dramatically, weeks everyone infected Christmas already tested positive numbers started drop, eventually reached current low numbers.

Because numbers low, talk relaxing lockdown point complete removal next couple months. lot people (me included) worried huge spike everyone goes crazy months restrictions. real test vaccine programme big spike see end lockdown. Yay Yeah profiting human suffering sure great. thought got rid that? time expression use year shutdowns... UK went lockdown ‚Äòprotect NHS‚Äô 40,000 people hospital growing like mad every day. 
No less 5000 dropping 350 per day. 
Vaccines indeed work. Won‚Äôt long hospital beds empty I've never tablet liquid steroids either. brown bleu inhaler. points review gone well I've needed inhalers much previous 3 months, nurse considered stopping prescription. I'm allergic cats trigger bad reaction including wheezing , never hospitalised me. need inhalers badminton, hill walking. get bronchitis kind cough, get quite wheezy, maybe there's notes files saying wheezy get bronchitis, triggered group 6.

Social media allowed beam message every corner world given way coordinate conspiracy nuts spread message organized fashion. think unfortunately allowed fringe theories spread control way before.  OK then. Here's question you: goal set lockdowns stop? need able quantifiable goal set this. Saying ""it saves lives"" good enough. logic we'd lockdown essentially everything.

In opinion life normal possible overflowing hospitals. NSW population bit 8 million. lockdown impacted area 250,000 people. That's pretty small portion population. Remember reality kicked realized pandemic cost almost 600,000 american lives? really thought public health experts going drop basic mitigation strategies it? LOL. UK Europe....

I'm sure vaccinations Germany speed soon, fingers crossed! might area GP, seems lot confusion asthma patients get even GPs getting Right india handle 6mn/day still using entirety private sector. can't find original article talked 7mn/day figure I'll give couple sources talk indian bureaucracy reason behind India's slow vaccination drive.

Also, blame Grumble Ah misread. Forget I'm gonna give pat back- I'm fully vaccinated now, unless fully asymptomatic cabal never aware of, never got gave anyone Covid. one time contact (at work), immediately went quarantine leave house except get Covid test 14 days elapsed. actions took really fucking hard I've hated every second last year (I can't even remember anything happened April-June 2020). I'm really, really hoping year changes, damn, every step forward feels like another two steps back. Gain function experiment milder bat-borne coronavirus? Considering deeply secret mistakes past authoritarian regimes buried I‚Äôd think us won‚Äôt even around truth comes start this, ever happens. want hug real life lol right still spread, vast majority vulnerable people vaccinated, hospitalisations deaths minimal. According [Covid Tracking that's also huge overstatement. data shows 1000 people currently hospitalized covid state low 200s ICU, peak winter surge four THOUSAND hospitalized nearly 900 ICU. Nobody ""flooding hospitals"" (and worth, cases even close either, although still rise pretty rapidly). travel lot Finally good news shit times Mexican culture different Sweden, big families living together, Mexicans way open interact people streets closed Swedes. 1 year‚Äôs worth pay sitting around? not, you‚Äôre giving crappy advice. use water, make life 100% easier India wasted months including private sector vaccination drive. Even india using private sector fullest capacity, fault leadership. Prominent stakeholders private sector literally lobby vaccinate people. usual, fault lies Indian bureaucracy, infrastructure. sound like freshman college taking first economics class. I‚Äôm sure think know lot learned lot book, assure you, know nothing useful. Well, don‚Äôt wanna laminate shots recorded well put. complicated. complex can't keep track every single detail. 

Some people still seem understand get virus close proximity infected person take viruses he/she spreads. matter happens. depend people get contact infected person. Sure details like humidity, temperature, individual immunity virus, influence spread, either way, need get contact infected person. 

If get numbers long period little social interaction travellers bringing virus local society, e.g. wedding hundreds people cousin Jonny comes holiday high risk place attend wedding shakes hands hugs everybody, suddenly huge spike. Yes, still lockdown. non-essential retail, pubs, restaurants open take away, today first day households allowed mix even outdoors. Schools opened 3 weeks ago. 

The government cautious reopening plan. latte every day? So, assuming $5 latte 183 days year, small business owner would $915 one year. That‚Äôs literally even half they‚Äôd need single month‚Äôs rent. africa bigger problems covid we‚Äôre gonna wear masks forever now? denying benefits vaccination actually increases anti-vaccination beliefs, IMO. 

The vaccines 70-95% preventing moderate infections probably 99% preventing severe infection death. Masks moderately effective best. vaccinated chances getting severe covid essentially zero. 

If afraid room w/o mask 2019, afraid room maskless fully vaccinated now. Cause chances would killed via Influenza 2019 higher I'd kill via Covid now. Post Pandemic I'll thing I'm now. He's still blame influenced future presidency, wtf?  would masks matter then? Everyone access vaccine. recent interview 3 Bay area epidemiologists basically assess risk level vaccinated. One doctor said would eat outside vaccinated, another said depended overall health condition &amp; age. mentioned 20's risk serious complications even contact covid nill, fine resume eating &amp; socializing public venues. 80's consequences. However, individual judgment &amp; decision. thought Michael Osterholm alarmist predicted ""category 5 hurricane"" surge cases. happening little later said, maybe beginning? got mine done mass vaccination site, didnt ask anything.  miracle collapsed 3 times now. Even half country get shots government bad (and no, whoever's un power rn matter, all) Everyday work. may required carry vaccine passport international travel certain destinations take cruise. deleted comment majority articles cited 12 days rather 5 I‚Äôd initially stated. Sorry mistake. people talking great is: aware businesses going bother right? Like even large events. mention weddings. That's hilarious, going ask vaccine passport wedding? Fucking, can't stop underage drinking wedding.

Do think underpaid ticket taker theater going give shit passport?

Do think anyone going care Madison Square Garden full again?

Yeah bouncer bar totally going asking vaccine passport go in, sure. Yikes.  Guess I'll stick mass vaccination site. I‚Äôm saying trashy affluent person torched consider kind lot money go cruises: you‚Äôre absolutely right lots people spend quite lot money cruises; many cabins expensive. doesn‚Äôt mean people booking class. long term side effects getting actual Covid way worse. Viruses hide nervous system resurface years later. Getting chicken pox kid makes susceptible shingles late life. Mono come back give meningitis. 

Non-mRNA vaccines made today different vaccines got baby young kid. They‚Äôre training course immune system. ‚Äúside effects‚Äù normal function immune system attacking it. 

A little hesitation understandable, millions people around world gotten vaccines past several months, sure enough work they‚Äôre safe, would encourage get one especially considering line work puts higher risk. Johnson &amp; Johnson effective variants P.1 sequencing something biden administration done 2 months ago. absolute minimum mandated data appear CDC card make difficult engage fraud That's rule large numbers regularly tested plan getting tested? Sounds like going Tijuana Comic-Con year US, Hawaii lowest 326 deaths per M.  NJ highest 2,746 deaths per M.

CA FL right next 1,482 1,546. close minimal difference relative scale. course, theres really way guarantee people vaccinated honor system, new york rolled passport like system afaik reading made feel happy.

its brutal months. Seems risky since tests aren‚Äòt anywhere near 100% accurate I'm going call horrible person lay victim hood, need zoom order understand selfish attitude is. Essentially people (the UK) coming lock time soon people would hospital dying. That's long short it, simple that. logic using personal level may make sense societal level kills. times simply what's good society everyone acting strictly best interests times leads breakdown trust responsibility one another makes collective efforts vaccine drive less effective harder pull off. obviously free opt collective responsibility, weighing 'risks' still getting jab view choice selfish one- rightly opinion. 

I'm going even go fact lot data types vaccines know pretty conclusively cause long term negative effects - particularly traditional ones. may beat July 4th Deadline great keep going track Again, miss point vaccines. hospitalization death rates reduced hard, vaccine success. doesn‚Äôt matter get sick days, vaccine still it‚Äôs job. No. ID health insurance card(in places). Nobody said world would end 10 years ago. yeah, driven car 15 years. bike everywhere. great. Solar power option us right now, is, yeah, absolutely we'll that.

My family make smart decisions part we're bunch selfish assholes know change required, whether like not, change coming. It‚Äôs selfish dangerous

I've got trip Mexico booked one month second dose think I'm selfish dangerous. data shows vaccines perfect there's low probability infection. work home wear mask public there's even lower chance I'd bringing virus country me.

I'm going hanging pool/ocean wind, humidity, 90 degree heat. Even vaccinated know outdoors like safe. economic perspective, I'm traveling tourist destination people live rely tourism industry income. 

I've diligent year vaccine almost certain getting infected spreading virus. I'm taking vacation. enough people well financially pandemic Roaring 20's occurred. think people gained excessive wealth lost period? record unemployment, local businesses shutting good, widespread deaths friends/family. really see Americans better financially before.

This pandemic helped rich people get richer poor people get poorer. Corporations Amazon experienced record breaking sales businesses catered. can't Roaring 20s less rich people money poor people less money.

Both parents want get Moderna would love get J&amp;J done assumed every adult already vaccines since required enter school. diseases control reason even assume would need passports those. major issues diseases could see point (although measles starting come back areas high amounts anti vaxxers since insanely contagious). 

Once Covid somewhat control, expect vaccine passport talk die down. weird phase people vaccinated aren't. No. Awesome! Hope life starts feel little better day day stay safe! I'm fine requiring vaccine.

I'm fine requiring masks, social distancing, weekly testing. **point** vaccines stop that. Every time place decides ""no even vaccinated need x, y, z"" people going continue ""well bother getting vaccinated"". I‚Äôm healthy 27 year old male opportunity get Moderna Wednesday J&amp;J Sunday. second Moderna shot would end April. recommendations either or? Pros cons?

Both parents want get Moderna would love get J&amp;J done Eh. country level wealth geopolitical influence would treated vaccine approach exactly way. 

And ideals gave us wealth vaccinate way first, time reason 33% Americans refuse get vaccinated (I think misinformed, agree right choose to). never truly unfortunately. vaccine hesitancy much lower countries. even outpacing countries vaccinating want it, believe slower countries could actually reach herd immunity faster us. random articles, random titles articles. true message ""IT vaccinated cannot transmit virus people dont selfish assh** going everywhere meeting others"" don‚Äôt think accurate. think that‚Äôs certain treatments like plasma [I understand people can't look things here's official Rutgers site Yes. public health experts see evidence safe use protective measures, guard transmission virus, Rutgers continue require social distancing use face coverings. BC Canada immunizing seniors order age, also hitting hot spots. Teachers staff one major city getting vaccinated, another town went vaccinated entire population. Indigenous communities getting vaccine teams fly remote areas. Certain workers getting vaccinated (dental hygienists, people farm factories, warehouses etc).

If vaccine plan, kept trying forever, that's totally different story. kinds actions next months roll vaccines seems sensible me. 

There plenty time debate whether point though. comes later. Change movement tracked via cellphone data shows lie. There‚Äôs reason thanksgiving Christmas massively upped death rate. everyone remain careful day day life (mainly public) reach herd immunity. parents vaxxed would def see issue that, terms seeing friends would also consider low risk personally try see friends vaxxed point (2 weeks post one shot would enough me). husband plan going gym fully vaxxed (him pfizer, J&amp;J) say high number cases remain linked gyms likely highest risk activity.

in short - incredibly well protected covid. nothing guaranteed though touching women inappropriately handling pandemic separate issues, one relevant subreddit. think also additional delay coroner report official death certificate. terms govt policy, sure theres much couldve done. However, individual level absolutely could've. state never went r=1.2 March 2020. would've taken 20% better performance absolutely crush this.

And, know capable every time virus spiked, people hunkered cases dropped again. coincidence r value hovered around 1 everywhere. People based decisions partially news, creating feedback loop. could done better.

This kind messaging pisses off. tell people still risk getting fully vaccinated, guess many people going say ""fuck it"" go back lives normally? Possibly not. Brazil saw dramatic increases deaths 30-39 40-49 groups, 2000 4000 respectively last month. That's dramatic increase previous months. 70% cases either UK Brazil variant now.

That absence statement enough many people adamant like this. question - please let know I‚Äôm misunderstanding.

The rise cases concerning due vaccines, really sad people downvoting news good. unvaccinated Americans think vaccine license whatever want reason.

Unvaccinated people going catching COVID means spread possibly make mutations get high-risk people ill. going means extremely unlikely catch COVID spread become ill, even continue masking taking precautions around unvaccinated people.

The CDC focused important people vaccinated start taking risks, instead, chose pretend getting vaccinated changes nothing individual person. talking Australian response need understand health state issue state's response considered separately almost like they're different countries. Australian states cases they're basically following New Zealand model locking low numbers.

New South Wales adopted aggressive suppression approach low level spread tolerated without lockdowns controlled contract tracing.

The EU same. allowed vaccinations produced Europe leave UK continents. makes sense considering scientists Universities world worked tirelessly them.

So quite ironic praise US UK vaccination efforts. EU acted like US has, UK government would struggle acquire vaccinations. EU lagging behind negotiated low prices refused close borders export locally produced vaccines Fine, biggest response possible me, without going overboard. bad fever, would taken naproxen. felt crappy, never spiked fever. womp womp. peak hospitalisations last summer.

If think lockdowns work though, tell UK got 0 deaths August last year.. would one wave virus lockdowns inhibiting it.

Like calling five year old writes sidewalk chalk driveway vandal level dramatic. can‚Äôt vaccine?

That‚Äôs thing terminally selfish. I‚Äôm fine Target requiring flu vaccine come in. It‚Äôs private business. Vaccination status protected class. want.

Edit: nonetheless, can‚Äôt imagine Target implementing something like this. large events flying like. close quarters longer periods time Ive before. Israel constant violation Oslo Accords... convenient. keeping parachute open still justified we're falling slowly? didn‚Äôt lockdown enough, must lockdown harder /s  closer quarter errands really enclosed spaces (offices), meetings etc. actually several occupations at-risk covid exposure, namely back room restaurant cooks unfortunate leader. Keep mind health workers form PPE mandated hospital clinic. Restaurant workers construction workers rarely protections. yeah older people get vaccinated risk death lowered too. 
But still lot people getting sick ICU levels... Shutting Facebook would great US *pay it*. Many times EU spent vaccines, fact. reason large chunk production capacity even exists US paid it. Eventually Europe get reap benefits capacity vaccinate population lower cost US UK, worth it? Probably not. live poor decisions capacity bail out. yay, remember easy getting test, NYC's pretty efficient took another scandal finally approve WOOO NY 16+ eligible starting next week! one hand, means people age get vaccinated hand snap stories going filled people flexing vaccine card. Like said, first world problems! Thanks! looked Israeli study another poster mentioned saw something tune ""initial findings"" ""preliminary,"" key takeaway (for me) CDC process validating replicating findings. seeing I'm process getting vaccinated, course believe it, think clear majority countries routinely jumped gun reopening efforts nothing hear taken absolute, ""what believe/know time."" appreciate seem understand nature post really great news! going harder harder keep mask mandates place people get vaccinated. people feel like they're everybody wants shot gotten one, support going nosedive.

Of course, kids 16 going exposed this, realistically think people care. one die ever must live eternal lockdown prevent death altogether That's bonkers. Healthcare got first jab December 21st. What's delay there? It‚Äôs actually opposite. People risk virus one least infected groups people, careful trying get infected. real reason vaccinated. don‚Äôt spread misinformation. create venn diagram people concerned issues [various environmental issues] people care long term effect vaccines, overlap.

To seems reasonable interpret statement saying people care long term vaccine effects people don‚Äôt care environmental issues. US context associating right wing pretty common. 

My reply specifically emphasizes overlap can‚Äôt pretend it‚Äôs ‚Äúthe side‚Äù only. definitely travel working. next time I'll able another 6 months least rack vacation. I'll probably never whole month definitely want take advantage this. 

Eastern Europe also saw open.... I've never much interest particular countries, persuaded.


Edit: mind rush jobs traveling. need detailed itinerary, often wing anyway. went Dubai Lebanon two weeks notice another plan fell through. Finally, people complaining Cuomo going slow shut up.NYS great vaccine rollout, happy NYer  Far higher efficacy compared flu vaccine. 30-40k people die flu never required flu vaccination enter private business. Also consider Target ‚Äúin public‚Äù really wish US would swap first dose first strategy, get ahead new waves variants.

Hopefully rest world follow model, since clearly works.

Hopefully we‚Äôll also getting good data whether longer gaps doses matter well. 7-day moving average +2.76M doses per day, highest record.

Out 2.35M reported today, 1.38M (59%) first doses. We're getting ever closer 100M first doses (95M hit today) - goes well hit milestone Friday week. March 17, 2021 14,792 COVID-related deaths Americans 40-49. 40 year old male overwhelmingly likely survive, even hospitalized. bet they're going try though lockdowns, locking even harder, guess... Solid bump last Monday don‚Äôt know we‚Äôd expect otherwise. go doctor presenting strep throat, influenza, etc., generally give diagnostic test. First said there'd spikes surges ""because vaccines now"". cases went said ""Well matter we've already vaccinated old sick"". Next comes strained hospitals.

We never learn. BionTech inventors... US spent hard picking fruit though :-p People claiming wouldn‚Äôt even see hospitalizations rise. Perhaps hospitals overwhelmed appropriate metric use moving goalposts.  Best comment I've read today. director CDC warning impending doom today, might show numbers degrading. wonder much they're limited aspects production besides mRNA itself. they'd found 30mcg mRNA sufficient Pfizer/BioNTech, would interesting know Moderna could 300m+ doses produced right now. don‚Äôt consider whether someone chosen get vaccinated private information. 

Whether cancer not: that‚Äôs deeply personal medical information. 

Whether chose get jab allows society return normal? Nah, I‚Äôm totes good business wanting know that. studies done without variants Moderna. can't compare numbers accurately. True like exporting EU couple millon AstraZeneca used US anyway. There's good chance adolescents approved late April/early May pfizer. really hoping adults covered get teens vaccinated give carefree summer. expect blow back people don‚Äôt want around people choose spread infectious diseases.

They blow want. dont live life appease general population. people grow sometime kindergarten You‚Äôve never worried polio, you?

Yes, lets compare polio covid. Lets compare ebola covid. Lets it! Actual diseases people dying streets! COVID anywhere NEAR polio ebola wouldnt discussion. Nobody would arguing lockdown. COVID .278% mortality rate. silly. report day, people using stats make decisions know works account it.

If daily report becomes lot less transparent, harder make quick decisions wait week know whether numbers fallen not.

And skipped Sunday, Mondays numbers would even whack. Virologists devoted lives gain function research particular. They've spent years trying cultivate viruses see ones pandemic potential humans virus finds us.

So either heroes villains story. natural virus, right along needed invest money research. came lab, research caused thing trying prevent would likely wide scale moratoriums research. there's difference ""looking promising"" ""we'll multiple vaccines 95 percent efficacy 10 months.""

If knew that, probably would gone much restrictive initial lockdowns. No, soon talk lifting restrictions 
/s  Nothing before, afterwards took tylenol twice 40 hour period, thats 1000mg time 2K total. help even without would OK. Absolutely awful. comment, portrays message ""impending doom"", fireable offense opinion.

Unless, course, bosses WANTED convey message.

Ugh.  USA's third wave. mild uptick plateau. Deaths keep dropping. good news. stadium require people vaccinated want they‚Äôre business. cdc pages say 2-8 weeks, look cdc graph every days notice backdate numbers date happened report date, based limited experience eventually match up. 

a 25k easily explained state two data dump worldometer put day report cdc dropped 100 cases onto 250 days involved whatever can't tell article 80% efficacy two weeks they're still counting folks test positive first days first shot (when expect protection event).

In case, numbers around staggeringly awesome. trials ongoing using Pfizer booster J&amp;J? turn one dose J&amp;J lagging protection fix booster huge deal. also really want see real-world impacts J&amp;J available. looked like antibodies increase like 50 days vaccination think Phase 3 trial tested 14 28 days. Anyway long keep preventing death hospitalization, vaccines win book. That'd make sense too, CDC even whispering hints that.

(Though I'd go farther say low hospitalizations deaths, almost nobody else interested vaccine. huge number people refuse vaccine keep getting sick, I'll sorry them, want country stay locked protect themselves.) city, Walmart place offering J&amp;J (the mass sites pharmacies offering Pfizer/Moderna right now). Makes sense - Pfizer Moderna combined delivered 30x many doses state J&amp;J far. Boy cried wolf much.... people delusional think majority people think dire circumstances ALREADY fucking vaccine, multiple! cases barely ticked up, areas. Fuck here. pandemic never end. 2 weeks stop spread would anyone reluctant get vaccine, begin with, get one current messaging get vaccine still must limit non-essential activity else going infect friends, family co-workers?

Especially sub shaming people hell leaving house vaccinated, imagine happens, well, outside subreddit. summertime people need deal children, anti-vaxx redditors, edge cases. Running errands mask? Billions already, unvaccinated. don‚Äôt need ask permission live life. **vaccine hesitation Kansas Missouri.** OC essentially implied doesn‚Äôt exist. CDC's website.

Maybe people continue wear masks public protect kids don‚Äôt see many child free people willing stay home/social distance protect people‚Äôs kids. It‚Äôs 68 degrees sunny, six weeks it‚Äôs going feel like inside human mouth 5 months. It‚Äôs perfect excuse wait line! okay people wearing pants public underwear going straight nude? going grocery, drug stores, etc, fairly high spread periods remained uninfected throughout far anyone could tell.

Millions Americans decided last summer give shit COVID also get infected despite actions. like statement implies everyone cautious caught COVID. instead messaging urging vaccinated wait weeks massive vaccine availability might get buy general public. Focus urging Americans get vaccinated ASAP.

She say that, make good urged Americans ‚Äújust hold little longer‚Äù get vaccinated virus it‚Äôs turn.** cases rise last week so, Walensky said, often ‚Äúsurge surge big‚Äù shortly thereafter. dude obviously joking. lol wow. 16+ got first dose today...2 weeks second one pandemic me, wearing mask places required. stay please. Let people suffered pain virus one hardest hit cities moment get people vaccinated. want visit Japan someday... Except course clinic trials vaccine showed response second dose. literally went talking March 2020 nothing changed since then. 

Then Biden coming saying wearing mask ‚Äúpatriotic duty‚Äù think laughable quote. proceedings Europe guide, kerfuffle cleared time ready dose #2 Life expectancy typically drops result infant mortality. someone survives first years life they're likely survive old age without good healthcare first years always hardest. lot African countries lower life expectancy.

The reason African countries young life expectancy rather people lots children. 12 countries world median age 18 Africa. Lower life expectancy caused high infant mortality high infant mortality lead children adults. biggest reasons lack contraceptives. So, 3 weeks, cases surging across continental US, recognize may right?

In Ontario, Canada, government ended harshest lockdown populous city. couple days later, hospital associations said already new wave. People calling hysteria unreasonable. 2 weeks following that, daily case counts doubled match around Christmastime hospitals running ICU capacity.

Sometimes experts right warn us.

With covid, never know acted early, sure hell know act late. Totally agree here. stupid laws books FAR many people abide nearly never prosecuted, selectively prosecuted discriminatory manner.

This normalizes law breaking that's pattern society want establish. information date. [Source: hysterics trying reopen things last summer got ugly? Lol joke   16 Pfizer Please provide scientific source says aren‚Äôt vaccinating quick enough stop variants.  data suggests drunk driving laws work, partially they're enforced stringently. That's remotely comparable stuff listed. giving strawman argument.

We data 50 states varying levels restrictions, honestly can't tell ones ""succeeded"" ones ""failed.""

The selective enforcement aspect separates mask mandates lockdowns drunk driving. mask mandates easily undermined people socializing private, need either enforce them, drop them. selective enforcement limbo we're currently results worst worlds. Thank explanation! suspect we're aggressively agreeing slightly.

The endless lockdown UK well breaking point. I'm fucking jealous 3 day lockdown isolate trace... reminds way high school used handle drug awareness campaigns.

‚ÄúScare young people! Stop air travel! Show pictures scrambled egg lungs! It‚Äôs way stop spread!‚Äù disagree also agree you. agree emotional level despise parties mishandled virus. Biden took over, little sense urgency government media February/March variants.

I unfortunately disagree near end pandemic. think we're hit worst pandemic. EU exported 10 million U.K., EU 20 million unused.

When myth finally die EU millions doses lying around refuse use. pile happens country (like US super fast rate vaccinations). normal. Vaccines get dispatched large charges get distributed. distributed count ""not used"". factor doses withheld second doses. EU countries vaccinating fast can. Germany build many vaccination centers close many fully manning simply vaccine supply much much lower capacity inject them.  vaccines widely available flu, around decades, understand it, treatments. casualties unfortunately deemed acceptable we've made every effort possible mitigate it.

This gets crux issue, right? absolutely made every effort possible mitigate flu. Children go school. concerts operas sporting events. Bars restaurants open. Shit, people even bother wearing masks public transportation large swathes population get vaccines treatments mortality pretty low. COVID we're far there. vaccines distributed right now. everyone chance it, sure, time relax restrictions.

You've hit salient points, mixing lot concepts (or passing others). risk analysis. Previously, risk COVID unacceptably high, high risk 65+ crowd, risk 22 year olds. simply need wait 22 year olds get reach level risk dictates allow things get back normal. like on/off switch either. risk things like indoor dining low enough cost keeping shut outweighs benefit. AstraZeneca work B1.135, three do. far immune system concerned vaccine COVID infection, IgM probably vaccine reliable studies efficacy 52-57% single doses. ~80% (which actually ~74%) single doses avoiding hospitalization -- awesome, enough achieve herd immunity. 

Oh, looks like we're pulling Astra Zeneca patients 65 take longer get population vaccinated key supplying enough number. Stop licking floor. virus' too. would probably help messaging director CDC crying national TV ""impending doom"". One could say given current supply constraints, getting hands low-dead-space syringe like finding needle haystack. ü§£ serious missteps along way.

They needed ramp production better, effective respirators way earlier on.

I N95s better hit US way pandemic now, work industry they're occasionally needed already order history right kinds relationships suppliers.

A lot people advantages.

Despite going grocery, drug stores, etc, fairly high spread periods remained uninfected throughout far anyone could tell.

Moving forward, country needs subsidize large stockpile well subsidize significant amount extra manufacturing capacity domestically matter national independence / national security. P1 escape vaccines (at least three use US). vaccine recipients even get sick, others may get sick probably avoid hospitalization. everything I've seen, they've given reason trust American (or other) people. medical experts told masks don‚Äôt work (Fauci) ?

Our medical experts lie us without thinking twice it, fact they‚Äôre shoving vaccine throats news everywhere else worry us incredibly unprofessional, definitely grounds removal. professionals suppose act handling public health situation. 

And don‚Äôt get doom. Vaccines effective, inching 30% vaccinated, 30% prior infected. overlap. administration says following science, see possible reach highs last wave. Germany also used army. True irrelevant 

Link official announcement. date cases detected Canada. wonder new data Europe. Anytime, cupcake &lt;3 Ah damn. Well here's hoping they'll let people get soon! close able administer 5M/day Virtue Signaling

Here pretty good link talking development risks vaccines. 5 minute rear goes bit detail wether rushed whys vaccine development.
 Fuck that, want exotic variants! think impact ‚Äúpause‚Äù 900k per country given far, you‚Äôre completely wrong. Even saying ‚Äú900k per country‚Äù disengenious that‚Äôs 10% population half EU countries. You‚Äôre saying like 900k small number median EU country population around 10M

Is vaccination vaccine limiting factor? much scientists attribute things like preventative measures successful vs less people get sick die many population already either died recovered? I‚Äôm confused statement. 
If CDC knows country heading towards ‚Äúimpending doom‚Äù - accelerate pace vaccinations even more. 
What stops running vaccination sites longer perhaps even 24x7, hire medical personnel, employ national guard FEMA run them?! done? 
 
Put stops fight it. situation changing change strategy. Thanks cutie üòò B117 variant becoming dominant virus death sentence hundreds thousands, millions more. getting close that. Many states provinces 25-40% new cases B117. doom-and-gloom official government line, yes, it‚Äôs much ask. threat: substantial number people still feel sufficiently personally threatened; could reassured low death rate demographic group, although levels concern may rising. good understanding risk found positively associated adoption COVID-19 social distancing measures Hong Kong. perceived level personal threat needs increased among complacent, using hard-hitting emotional messaging. effective must also empower people making clear actions take reduce threat.‚Äù Vaccines work P1 variant. course it‚Äôs still possible vaccinated people spread virus. vaccine 100% effective. real chance could 0% effective preventing transmission, it‚Äôs good news isn‚Äôt case. Kids safe get vaccinated too. Shrug. you. 19 million AZ doses fine far! necessarily normal distribution? (I'm epidemiologist) mass lockdowns? Well case, happy hear that. understanding variants exist, P1 shown resistance vaccination levels. Bottom line P1, jury still stopped current vaccines. I'm hoping can. wanna say really appreciate common sense sub LOL. much doom gloom everywhere else. Feels good finally see end end tunnel. nothing new.

Recover B1.351, however, you‚Äôre seemingly much position regard acquired Study came today saying 80% effective 2 weeks first dose second shot. friend also vaccinated, I'd go sure. haven't, level risk tolerance. week ago said safe reduce distance schools. saying potentially facing doom.

They‚Äôve closed loophole know people jumped line spare link friend effective stopping spread relevant metric math stops new mutations.

The studies different sizes. DOOOOOOOM! got J&amp;J shot apparently 100% effective preventing deaths guess who's NEVER DYING Limiting non vaccinated people employers requiring punish anyone except people refuse get vaccinated. didn‚Äôt. I'm saying reason deaths bc we're old fat, probably spreading like wildfire poorer countries really restrictions underreporting it. Deaths low bc young country, bc they're somehow keeping spread low. Oh really? live Philly. know that! Thanks heads up. fall 1c category figured I'd wait time April then. Socializing mask miserable. Non-verbal cues important interpersonal communication.

This Zoom taken pandemic versus conference calls.

Some healthcare workers protective gear hides face walk around big laminated head-shots see there.

Where possible, healthcare workers seem favor PAPR systems headgear transparent cover face, people interact see faces.

For overwhelming majority people, absolutely makes difference social settings. end May, every adult wants vaccine one, according CDC. time approved youth issue. States choose ask 16's wait, like phases. help stop spread get though.
I agree adults go first, unless health issues. close vaccinating enough stop variants. could stopped variants Biden aggressive DPA (or Trump anything positive).

A good comparison would look happened Ireland B117 surge December. Makes sense, think around lower 20 million said 11 million J&amp;J week.

Assuming 1/3rd J&amp;J, thats 22 million first/only doses. 

Thats 6.6% population 8.3% 16+ population... 1998. 1986. 2002. birthdates written body bag tags intentional overdoses. haven‚Äôt seen anything like 7 years healthcare. It‚Äôs really affected mental health, too. Especially 1986. She‚Äôs age single mom 3 kids 10. wants people keep guards cases begin tick back large majority country. Variants keep us worried vigilant. lady acts like Nancy Grace white girls goes missing. would seriously think Covid entirely new CLASS pathogen, virus, bacterium, fungus, protist, parasitic animal, something entirely else, way people sometimes talk it. It‚Äôs like think fact it‚Äôs technically (and technically‚Äîit‚Äôs closely related SARS-CoV-1) novel virus means entire field viral immunology tell us nothing we‚Äôre completely starting sticks stones level scientific knowledge. It‚Äôs tantamount discovering new celestial body saying can‚Äôt assume gravity unless send probe measure gravity. Completely understandable. Hope start feeling better soon. NH additional super site weekend 50+ open appointments several days. high risk folks willing drive could've vaccinated. 40+ coworkers made day appointments morning. say go it. LIKELY came lab.

Even damning, genomic data Chimeric horseshoe bat CVs (yes, that's Sars-Cov-2 is) passed mice, genetically modified carry human ACE2 receptors lungs, DESTROYED along traces spliced viruses, shortly team's arrival.

Yes, happened.

We also know several workers WIV became ill Covid-like symptoms around 10/2019, coincides origin timeframe agreed upon top epidemiologists.

Finally, natural explanation Furin Cleavage site present sars 2, fits within conceptual model zoonotic origin virus.

The reason able locate animal species host, likely none. Variants happen. humans animals since zoonotic disease. Trying prevent variants fool's errand. whole right wing connection reaching hard connection.

Especially given many folks posting vaccine cards social media. 

The vaccine passport neat idea, implementation US ounce ""authenticity"" baked it. news stories cover calculations economic tradeoff vs. deaths?

As 38 year old, I‚Äôm glad gotten leftover dose last week Friday. Wow yeah told ID wasn‚Äôt acceptable needed social security card well? Maybe depends state states better democrat-run states...

Please stop pushing narrative stick facts. sure, alternatives great either. would assume alternatives basically putting vulnerable kind ""super"" lockdown, letting virus flow population. imagine that's even particularly practically possible without way care home staff, example, paid large amount physically live care homes entire year, really invest kind infrastructure meant never leave (to buy stuff etc). think lot staff end periods lockdown, first hand know course short term. I'm sorry, right. US sending 4 million AstraZenica vaccines Canada Mexico.  Well, DC couple hundred thousand people staten island folks want give *them* 2 senators (in addition making anyone lives whatever ""old"" DC becomes powerful voters country), really see problem.

Chudland giant dweebs getting shot boon decent people. sure, seen anything suggesting 40 yo's developing nations equal risk serious COVID complications 65+ yo's developed nations. I'm open reading contrary evidence any. country like Singapore national vaccine registry yes. US, 1/3 adults already received dose nothing flimsy little black/white card ""proof"" I'd say ship sailed, hit reef, sank. vast majority 22bn gone testing massive infrastructure set it.

Source? seem completely missing word ""test"" ""test trace"". vast majority 22bn gone testing massive infrastructure set it. still pessimistic March 2021? Covid almost done US. Vaccines way effective exponential growth. Pharmacies PA slower throughout too. say seem scaled past month lot seem efficient used (dedicated lines vaccines vs pharmacy services, better pre check processes).

The pharmacies advantage mass vaccination sites - them. Even pharmacy lower throughout, added together many probably administer doses even though individually slower. know, we've covid I'm worried dates lining correct run issues. think right. 

I'm little nervous relaxing measures faster/earlier Israel possibility contagious variants time get bigger foothold here, I'm cautiously optimistic vaccine efforts overcome additional factors too. mean way life abuses body far advanced societies.

Malnutrition, lack medicine, difficult working conditions, exposure various toxins air, food, water, workplace, homestead, etc... contribute premature aging, illness, death. ""near"" herd immunity. herd immunity. in, enough innoculated citizens, infection (which still hit 1% population &amp; viable path forward) vaccine (which 50% adults point, much viable), virus longer spreading communities, rather isolated single infectious individuals can't spread others total amount immunity around them. recent science suggests herd immunity require range innoculation--this entire population, adults, UK require innoculating children well. 

Until point, version virus still poses risk spreading high enough rate spread will, eventually, generate variants vaccines protect us against. I'm sure feel risk ""redundant""--it is, fact, main risk keeping UK restricted measures. also see ""harm lockdown"" case worse resurgence full-blown pandemic spread, happen without tough measures ahead herd immunity. Obviously lockdown sucks, we're tired it, economic implications, etc., bigger risk (because comparative risk) fuck end another year garbage. control spread, vaccination we've done far rendered useless inevitable evolution another variant. 

tl;dr: virus definitely still poses significant threat, even though deaths currently down. want watch meaningful number (in terms return normalcy), watch case numbers go double digits, single digits, even zero. we'll start see real move away protective measures.

Counties seem getting equal numbers vaccines, screwing southeast PA (the densely populated suburban Phila counties). unknown/undiagnosed co morbidities?  science *suggested* case time, make decision high stakes requires cautious choice made.

We full, robust data two shot regimen early data single shot. Basically, *knew* two shots effective *thought* one shot would work. 

In hindsight, yes appears gamble would paid imagine disaster single shot proved ineffective essentially wasted 100M vaccines people needed start scratch.  official guideline live 14 days, unless hospitalized recieved antibody therapy (then 90 days). Anecdotally, got first shot 5 weeks testing positive severe side effects. believe X anything behind this? info regarding people getting infected fully vaxxed?

If not, sounds completely unfounded hysteria. Link peer reviewed paper. google search. Show science! UK ordered funded research one vaccines. didn‚Äôt UK first got guarentees vaccines would get delivered. enough data original studies see one provided protection.

Man, get paid browse reddit downvote day lol? tests done Dec. 14 March 13. means variants full play here. one dose effective own, two doses even so. light end tunnel getting brighter brighter. variants seem able hold vaccines even without fine tuned specific variant.

Yeah. timing messaging miss. real world evidence thus far - full vaccination takes shelf serious, moderate many cases even symptomatic bout covid. Lets start selling benefits getting vaccinated more. point it‚Äôs clearly effective real world. look Israel. Start messaging vaccine worth much society mask becoming golden ticket returning normal. past year, we've situation cases, hospitalizations, deaths strict incontrovertible proportion

This true all. mortality rate falling US pretty much since start pandemic. making things justify ignoring rising case numbers. This. It‚Äôs embarrassment. paired fact southeastern PA collar counties, WAY densely populated rest state, getting # vaccines rural county. botched SEPA getting screwed. Congrats siblings across pond :) Finally, reexamine prior studies reporting large effects SIP orders COVID-19 cases deaths (1, 2), find results robust reasonable alterations modeling choices. reasons enumerated, conclude weight evidence suggests SIP policies large effects. Indeed pandemic vaporized pros urban living greatly emphasizing cons. 

**Typical pros:** 
* Much shorter commute work 
* Proximity bars restaurants  
* Proximity entertainment venues/events 
* Proximity friends/family  
* Proximity major airports/train stations 
* Increased ability network  
* Much walkable environment 
* Better access public transport 

**Cons:** 
* Much higher cost per sq.foot living space 
* Decreased chance/higher cost private outdoor space  
* Higher costs goods/services 
* Car ownership much expensive (e.g. insurance). Parking much less convenient. 
       
The pros get crushed pandemic/lockdown environment. commute work. Bars, restaurants, entertainment venues closed. strongly encouraged physically distance friends/family. ride public train unless to. Flying highly discouraged. 

Sure, walk places, likely park grocery store mask times. feels like dystopia.

I'm sure city-life bounce back quickly (it's already starting) us endured pandemic 400 sq. ft. apartments, forget. We'll take steps better prepared next pandemic. still wearing masks? Yes get it

Everyone needs scared eternity one person comes Covid received first shot Pfizer Thursday. However, roommate getting sick contact last night (Sunday). thinking, would protection really fight infection roommate Covid? saw one dose moderna Pfizer 80% effective, long would take kind immunity? government loves wielding power cripple economy long good reason /s Twitter way we'd locked forever opened completely. consensus outside two hyper-militant echo chambers. Maybe lockdown ends Also interesting single vaccine far confers antibodies natural infection. people recatching covid particularly high rates. long there's significant variant escapes vaccines, far pfizer least, could last years. Simply put, risk isn‚Äôt going nearly enough keep people home living lives, going school, socializing, on. wasn‚Äôt enough early on, definitely isn‚Äôt enough now.

""I know travel up, worry see surges saw summer winter again.""

There little reason believe winter surge happen again. realized day even excited news lockdown easing week.

One bit bad news fuckers lock us again. 

Fuck December mid-March supply vaccine ramping next weeks April May. say Pfizer vaccine effective one dose? 11 days 14 days? Personally get plane reason right now. Sinovac vaccine gone trial Turkey showing effectiveness would recommend getting that. difference effectiveness (if any) going offset decreased risk traveling.

If reason vaccine passports become thing, sinovac vaccine accepted, get different vaccine future easier come by. Yes, also lockdown defficient. Preferable risking going another lockdown That's literally every country done. ones successful geographic advantages small, homogeneous populations. let people enjoy things

The last refuge regression case. Believe people think matters sort things enjoy. kinds entertainment value culture. Actually funny, someone supposedly defending utility consuming children's media adult, view gives entertainment little credit. Every piece media interchangeable everything else long someone enjoys something cares is? That's view entertainment sees essentially powerless trivial, without real power change world general personally view interact it. weird perspective. wave never stop statistics way disastrous waves combined Germany. source that, chance? seen evidence Brazil variant rendering vaccines ineffective. Yeah, curfews ridiculous response. Stopping people going time shops closed, streets quietest least likely come contact people. like protecting people sharks closing swimming pools. Man guys idiots. process set take months earliest. Fetal Cell Lines Used **Make** Johnson &amp; Johnson COVID Vaccine‚ÄîHere‚Äôs First almost child America 'locked up' covid unless parents allow it.

Secondly, lots things figured safely children allows social physical interaction. places opportunities course, want take time look imagine find something children involve staying inside alone. 

I get tired seeing debate distilled simple phrases like 'locked up'. Can‚Äôt wait gets downvoted oblivion People need trusting others right thing.

Even right thing, think government's job punish people choosing get vaccinated.

If everyone wants vaccine get one, hospitals risk overwhelmed, literally care less vaccination status people around me. want go concert without presenting medical records wearing mask enter venue, care COVID eradicated that. ""most people""? Nobody ever going stop us dying. Everybody dies. millions people Europe still basically house arrest exit plan. will. adapt ‚Äòhotel‚Äô desk policy reserve spot plan go in. It‚Äôs wasteful keep full office desks everyone chance want come in. entire island though, definitely get rich place like Washington Heights East Harlem fact sarcasm it‚Äôs biggest whoosh career Redditor. honestly I‚Äôve seen 100% genuine comments ridiculous don‚Äôt know anymore really addressing point settled court law... appears probably procurement process board contractually nothing hold UK/AZ accountable for. EU nice guys - guess much depends side channel sit. solutions. Plenty countries shown good governance solution.

There trade dealing virus appropriately, reopening appropriately, economic loss. Dealing well reduces economic harm. Opening responsibly ensures certainty future harm.

The worst thing little both. Vacillate lock downs surges, exhaustion indiscipline. US done. economic activity driving surges, lots people relaxing behavior, slightly early, again. Yeah, read says 0.7 0.9, see say automatically trust things internet (though UK government far others). 

We cannot know true R value ""now"", assume cases 12 days ago average estimate looking case counts. Serial interval believed 5 days, 5-day percentage change case count R value. Sounds simple, - every model does. course incorrectly call ""now"".

I use 7-day rolling average, look changes 7 days. makes delay even longer (technically one week longer, 19 days ago, somewhat smoothed around day). calculation becomes [(today's rolling average cases)/(last weeks rolling average cases)]^(5/7). Using total case counts entire week would give identical result.

For ""today"", 3/28 using [worldmeters calculation gives Picking day random (""Jan 30"") roughly visually steepest part decline (this would obvious log graph, I'm looking log graph sadly) gives issues ""now"" describe ones talking about. test result reported today comes infection 6-20+ days ago; state average age 12 median 10 days know information (cases symptom onset) available UK. weekends holidays testing plummet, get hole graph test result day - graph infection symptom onset day always remains pretty steady.

But see causing problem. Cases remained nearly flat (possibly around R~0.97 value) weeks now.

It's really strange, quite opposite calculation shows reproductive value continuing drop - numbers publishing near identical simplest calculation. 

I seen mention news science sources, assume young unvaccinated people UK causing higher rate spread two months ago. happen (even flatlining) half population vaccinated country still technically lockdown (?) crazy.  investment banker making 100k unless starting bottom (I worked consulting wealth managers). make far that, become investment bankers. people stockholm syndrome. furthered point. decision whether go things point pandemic. Everyone informed enough virus make choices dont need government holding hand. yea covid gonna gone really soon Germany spent less 1B system actually works.

You say that, Germany pretty fucked right end sight. initial success seems luck, anything else. article linked June 2020..

Germany currently experience third wave. slang specifically ¬£, currency. Return loan maple syrup? 

Seriously, think article explains ""loan"" Government: *Arrests protestors, fines businesses tens thousands reopen, drags ""two weeks"" restrictions year*

Also government: ""C'mon guys trust us? install tracking app pls."" Nice, happy see UK good vaccine rollout subpar management. let's get rest world place. CDC averaged last 5 years used benchmark deaths 2020 called whatever number excess. Problem deaths increasing every year taking average biased estimate 2020 lower thus exaggerated excess deaths.

Couple deaths 2020 due factors indirectly linked pandemic aka lockdowns yeah.

Not denying excess covid exactly many. Why? Never understood social... card never changes paper desintegrates weeks. large sites NYC. sure it‚Äôs different here. What‚Äôs misinformation?

Nothing said wrong. don‚Äôt like people speaking narrative want forced everyone‚Äôs throats. Yeah, country. people also die staff used maintaining half empty ICU instead Emergencies etc.

Almost sub-optimal use resources lead avoidable deaths/suffering. completely agree you. Good find things left right still agree on!! That's EU vaccinated anyone that's individual countries do. Yeah! got 2nd shot yesterday. would wear like badge honor! There's superficiality comics medium, popular bias them. see past appreciate true works art medium offers, include capeshit.

Federal government charge procurement distribution. provincial governments ones decide how/when/where/who gets vaccinated. 

Federal government recommendations ""template plans"" provincial governments follow Canada, Healthcare much provincial jurisdiction. Long-term, variants occur there‚Äôs high levels spread. spread isn‚Äôt high it‚Äôs much harder virus evolve. possible EU bungling vaccine rollout facing third wave, UK might put tight restrictions travel two. However, UK forefront testing IDing variants stamping they‚Äôve arrived, we‚Äôll likely continue strategy new ones occur; meantime, they‚Äôre already developing producing boosters current variants, likely ready autumn. 

There aren‚Äôt shortcuts pandemic, unfortunately. It‚Äôs tough measures it‚Äôs control, globally, otherwise it‚Äôll rear ugly head we‚Äôll back square one. that's one company, that's EU vaccinated Even looking around state still restrictions, simply given up.

Instead approved 'emergency use'. force people take experimental medication There‚Äôs definitely faction people said opening schools completely safe close zero risk, insane, opening anything involves risk place people spend time together close quarters somewhere virus spread. 

I work school, think main, rational, argument benefits school outweigh negative effects since especially now, teachers vaccinated kids don‚Äôt get horribly sick covid. negative side effects closed schools kids learn absolutely nothing remotely (in younger grades least), kids terrible home situations, mental health kids spiraling, U.S least, places like restaurants bars open lots places schools aren‚Äôt. 

So like activity, going risk infection, agree whole idea schools magical places viruses don‚Äôt exist silly, risk-benefit analysis school since it‚Äôs essential service willing take risk.  people care cards?

New York strangle death selling cigarettes. building, use break law three easy payments slap wrist. civil. Yes, ov course. Lovely. Going concert mask seems horrible. hope long term thing. sustainable though? Maybe countries strategy, that‚Äôs case. Would long term strategy close borders regular basis local lockdowns soon instance (new variant the) virus found community? scientific ""don't know"" translate well laymen. scientific know mean idea, enough information make conclusion. start pandemic state, ""we know"" would cause panic lack evidence direction lot debate scientific community. worry run masks might anything.

It's general populus got confused this, normally scientists brought settled issues, things still debate. 

Now know masks work, scientific consensus reached, took couple months get there. general population used hearing debate. civil. idea became infected? lied us that. Yes!!! Congrats, happy you!! previous administration responsible absurd response pandemic history humanity. king. emperor, politician charge ever tried hide disease political calculations.

Nope...nothing cover here, clearly. Let's take China's word face value move on. Spineless toothless WHO. disgrace. grim reminder ""Stay Home. Save Lives. ‚úåü§ó"" possible wealthy people. spread misinformation. It‚Äôs wonder. pandemic changed everything. Lives upended completely. Family businesses gone good. People told allowed work. couldn‚Äôt see family friends. Understandably, ppl latched easiest solution (it‚Äôs lie. Even government officials saying it) lashed result wish card big could actually fit wallet Oh totally, I'm American share view system. remembered article read recently ICU strategy comment seemed like good time share :) gets even absurd people accuse EU promoting vaccine nationalism... reputable news organizations picking this. Really depends situation. Moderna effective, six week process opposed two weeks j&amp;j. youre OK careful extra four weeks, moderna! It‚Äôs people don‚Äôt want hear it. want justification positions actions they‚Äôve taken past year. look real estate subs. It‚Äôs COVID rise! definitely catalyst makes WFH stay forever! definitely need house suburbs home office you‚Äôre going pay 30% list one ever going back office don‚Äôt want work apartment forever! Cities never reopen there‚Äôs reason live downtown anymore, join 20,000 people fighting one house suburbs! totally made right decision paying double list price two bedroom three hours work COVID keep office indefinitely! 

Not surprisingly, people real estate agents want huge commissions keep coming. Boosters required sure, &amp; delivery system still development. C'mon celebrate small wins! think anyone thinks yet. That's plan, make sure really last one, take slow make sure virus ground irrelevance. countries like Brazil manage recover. Covid hot-spot really, really hope vaccine-resistant strain come there. ""though hospitalizations deaths still down. "" seems like important take away. 

""In Orange County, cases rise among young people. People 45 younger account one three hospitalizations Covid""

Would expected group vaccinated older 50 able vaccination? we‚Äôre worried perhaps send doses NYC instead healthy 30 year olds states. Look, acknowledge we‚Äôre actually control of:

OP asked choose one other. responded. surprised, cousin healthcare telling something similar quite while. Awful situation there's light end tunnel year. There's reason think that. simply enough data vaccine newer. I'm looking studies released soon sounds baffling me. I'm Norwegian, I've gotten fairly used government ~~spoiling me~~**spending money me**, get see ~~what like side.~~**what like like government telling spend money on**

FTFY.

Your government spoil you. absurd taxes pay do. ""spoil"" yourself.

You're experiencing like like government says do. That's trade-off socialism. great agree it, sucks don't. Expect feeling next 50 years. Considering lost card shot 1 2 made new card within 60 seconds...I'm sure serious invalidating social security card. Wait what's point daily reporting daily? thought also affected transmission? realistically expect catch virus mainlining germs straight mouth licking anyway. Yeah news I‚Äôve seen previously infected may likely feel symptoms vaccine first shot even really known yet. Either way go Friday shot #1 (Pfizer). corona new year see... Israel's vaccination rate almost stopping 60%? many kids younger 16 country? late 20th century sold making us enough money. yes, fully approved EUA   Oh, case nevermind. feds deploy fema site Miami Beach age restrictions. would lot good. isnt late lot people. end surges, stop acting like vaccine reward good behavior. 
They approve astrazeneca use whole supply target young adults ASAP. One vaccine enough effective. 

The federal government tools end they're acting like. millions vaccines ice. isnt states.

Edit: doom gloom, Florida would done worse average. serious situation doom gloom make. Chicago example, living city proper probably means good 1.5+ hour commute way.

As we've seen pandemic, people learning much life wasted going work home. Christ man give fucking rest please CDC says something mean true btw. Redford (director last year Trump power) changing tune constantly, dont need masks, do, dont, former employees still management, listening thing listening Trump injecting bleach. Thats reputation CDC now, Opposite Science political. new Director Wallensky serious work get CDC back legitimate respected again. get 2 second doses then? sake saving money *on vaccine sold cost*. Already significantly cheaper vaccines still went penny pinching route. sounds like awful lot hospitalizations deaths. Mis large area small? true, high effectiveness vaccine, zero deaths (in day least) place one global hot zones months, direct travel links societal ties major regions (East Asia, India, South Africa, US), that's huge. 

I think incredibly unlikely effect dramatic would totally absent 4 weeks data tens thousands people. 

I get people wanted extra cautious ensure vaccines wasted, vaccine-resistant variants develop (which BTW remains seen), country like US, completely bungled every public health issue last 4 years, sudden take scientifically exact limited approach vaccines... boggles mind. would stop taking every word Fauci says gospel go data showing. analyze J&amp;J vaccines? feel like real world data scarce would love see numbers. Eric Feigl-Ding must shambles Another american rich savior. Yes, please!

Vaccine messaging needed. Rolling J&amp;J vaccines dorms, beaches, bars truly end pandemic. Bringing vaccines neighborhoods blue collar workplaces would help immensely. easy make split second decision get least first dose vaccine. Israel laying great blueprint.

Have ever thought anyone yourself? 
Missouri republicans played politics vaccine. take care voters say ‚Äòwe‚Äôre fine, what‚Äôs you‚Äôre problem!‚Äô Seems like locker somewhere building would solve that. didn‚Äôt get jack shit! Milwaukee, step up! want sticker! want international traveling want advice go with. double dose vaccinated. 

Backstory: transitioning new job soon, happen April. 

I would like go to

1. Rwanda/Kenya- think test good. Rwanda would great I'd like tag team Kenya. Problem is, Kenya hitting third wave I'm worried lockdown make worth trip.

2. Portugal- second go to. Apparently they're letting vaccinated people in. LOT interest country cheap fly lot less hassle Rwanda/Kenya.

Those choices. suggestions countries I'd open but... advice whether Kenya worth Portugal instead? perhaps third option? Recreational Weed legal NJ best 5 years legal nationally. (Even though rolled yet)  one care. still happy fucking zero. Even it‚Äôs low weekend number, it‚Äôs zero. Unless it‚Äôs error reporting. It‚Äôs zero. Stop trying keep fear dread going.  Hmmm... Wonder why?!

I wonder Boeing MAX...?! vaccine properly tested variants J&amp;J vaccine around 1 8 vaccinations it. others conclusive data all. Thats 4 days ago. research, done mine. 2nd Modena done. Thanks Dolly! Let‚Äôs this! seems based demand J&amp;J people love convenience 1 shot. There's also greater comfort ""normal vaccine"" vs new mrna. Also allergies PEG slightly higher incidence minor side effects mrna ones. J&amp;J great vaccine choice mind getting 2 shots personally feel mrna vaccines way go. could realistically stop people Wisconsin / Indiana entering IL working Chicago? don‚Äôt get blue IL / Chicago. could have, would have. prevent severe illness hostpilization, J&amp;J 70ish percent two weeks, works lot faster. 45 days 80%, really lot different. I'd hearing last couple years would push US move towards something like Chinese social credit score system (if unfamiliar highly recommend looking YouTube terrifying). appears that, sadly becoming reality much quickly thought possible. last year taught anything people gladly embrace process sign away rights.

Covid pose threat public safety, definitely answer. Yeah, ridiculous document important flimsy easy ruin can't much protect things could invalidate it. Staten Island 80% population Wyoming. disagree cdc Reuters top White House official issued dire warning recent rise coronavirus cases US, telling briefing Monday: ‚ÄúRight I‚Äôm scared.‚Äù Dr Rochelle Walensky, director federal Centers Disease Control Prevention (CDC), deviated prepared remarks reflect ‚Äúrecurring feeling impending doom‚Äù.

Going hunker couple months, get vaccinated, going back living life. Simple, direct messaging without emotional pleas work lot better IMO. mRNA isn‚Äôt 100 year tech. 

Totally agree knowledge. would taken vaccine day 1. mRNA vaccines new tech  long 1st dose ""80%"" protected? get 2nd shot thrursday. yeah think things two weeks first shot long exercise level care. Avoid crowded bars things like honestly even travel wearing mask etc totally fine opinion two weeks first dose.

The problem taking one dose still think decent chance transmitting someone get sick also immunity particularly robust variants. Even 1.1.7 could somewhat issue one shot Mine automatic. texted link download digital card. 70% Americans 65 gotten least one dose. That's hospitalizations deaths declining. CDC director still claiming United States facing, quote, ""Impending doom.""

Agreed. take one day time. always hope children vaccinated earlier. Since population decide need *more incentive health* get vaccine? Crazy times... monitor everyone every group amount time. Take look table 2 [the base efficacy calculation number COVID cases per 1000-person-hours group monitored. (They also use fancy statistical model top that). someone asked Pres. Biden end press conference ‚Äúdo think states pause reopening efforts?‚Äù 

He said yes. 

I really hope states don‚Äôt try put genie back bottle. 50% number based people getting cases first 10 days. basically vaccine takes certain amount time works. reach 14-day mark first dose 80 85% effective. take 2 weeks get I‚Äôm sure agree. decent data people initial studies whatever reason gotten one shot. pretty confident solid protection one dose.

The question long, long could booster doses.

I agree UK‚Äôs decision risk, would argue less risky sticking two dose option. would easier blame things went wrong.

Hopefully get one dose planet year, slow things get variant vaccines really don‚Äôt work on.  Thank you! originally 6/20/20 indoors venue definitely adjustment originally planned we‚Äôre pretty excited nonetheless. :) People internet really struggle understand exists group people dislike masks, still put mask requirements.

It's like there's two extremes: either dirty anti-masker, think masks greatest thing ever never stop wearing one even COVID eradicated. hot take say, ""I want keep wearing mask longer necessary,"" reason is. use TurboVax VaccineFinder worked me. easy possible.

Congratulations! Manitoba - suspended vaccines EU concerns unless information drop announced yet. I‚Äôm getting first shot Friday too! Moderna. study really reassuring. happened me. Got 2nd shot last Sunday. Felt pretty rough Monday night, perfectly fine 2 days, Thursday/Friday neck pain, swollen lymph nodes, fatigue again. Also headache since shot 2. Every infection represents millions chances new variant. Enough new variants vaccines stop effective. start back square one.

The pandemic literally go 'forever', least several lifetimes. That's normal human history. know you, extended isolation stress really starting take toll mental health. I'm sure state goes another year. cases happen rarely. would big blow European vaccination campaign restrict completely, would cause distrust. proven link treatment option sensible option would continue vaccinations give women 55 also take contraceptives option choose preferred vaccine. people don‚Äôt think risk death even caught COVID. 

The mRNA vaccines clearly superior preventing infection transmission. makes sense people would prefer Pfizer moderna. last couple weeks regret big time taking virus seriously starting Feb 2020 living fear covid, sometimes living building 1-2 weeks time, wearing N95 outdoors runs, skipping gym whole year February. 45 gym workouts last two months wearing simple N9 mask get infected.

I‚Äôm New Mexico. :) Private businesses able mandate see fit. government could honest say, ""Vaccinated people need wear masks, recommend businesses keep mask requirements see fit people vaccinated, since people lie.""

Like already saw Texas states, every big retail chain continue requiring masks. Meanwhile small businesses struggling decide whether want require masks. lastly, perhaps importantly, vaccinated employees could finally work factories, restaurants, offices without wear mask 8 hours. seems like reasonable approach me. NEVER comply this.  VAAAXASSES Yes ofcourse factors, reason cautious. already know transmissible variants spreading, case world. fact. vast majority people yet vaccinated take several months get full vaccination plus immunity get even resistant variant. 

I dont know denying downplaying actual experts know us saying believing want. Love generalization &lt;3 Serious suggestion: 


Wear ear-saver, loop ends mask around ponytail (if one). keeps tension ears, straps flip glasses earpieces. fold paper towels, put quart ziplock bag dump 70%alcohol bag. Carry purse, refill often.

COVID higher percentage people willing get vaccine. People reading fake information online making afraid get vaccine (ie - false fertility notion disproven ACOG recommend vaccine pregnant, breastfeeding, looking get pregnant women). think question people willing get vaccine knowing consequences getting (my husband around sister law without getting vaccine afraid get laws said family get togethers gets vaccine - care consequence. said she'd rather go bars restaurants see family).

^(Parent commenter ) [^(delete message hide  Woo hoo! Remindme! April 17 [related article revised report issued Mexico's health ministry (in Spanish) showed end sixth week 2021 294,287 deaths ""associated Covid-19"" - 182,301 confirmed figure given Since mid-February 26,772 Covid-19-related deaths reported across Mexico would take total 321,000.

surprised find caught news yet. website currently lists Mexico 201,623 deaths 3rd highest world (behind U.S. Brazil), stemming 2,226,550 cases, 14th highest world.

Applying numbers listed article, Mexico would 321,059 deaths, eclipsing Brazil 2nd-most Earth. Perhaps worrisome Case Fatality Rate -- 14.4 fecken percent! global average like TWO percent, even Italy's barely 3 percent. 

Which would seem suggest one two conclusions -- either Mexico's ""true"" case numbers much much higher, like factor 5 8; factor(s), perhaps lack access medical care, made COVID much lethal Mexico nation. I'm honest, kinda hope ""true case numbers much higher"" Let hate consume you. Anger. Rage. Cry like baby. Marsupial carnage reigns. Like river flowing. Dehydration actually common treatable one I've heard. We'll disagree there, feel guidelines given sooner. States lifting restrictions places like bars restaurants nothing CDC guidelines say vaccinated people meet privacy homes.

What CDC done create guidelines lifting public restrictions, like sort vaccination numbers need reached movie theatres open truth every cluster needs faced snap lockdowns.

That's simply true, clusters dealt purely contact tracing probably have. specifics one involved unconnected cases decided short lockdown. agreeing everything wrote, I'd actually argue come opposite conclusion.

Rather say, ""we could collectively changed behavior hundreds millions people better messaging,"" think argue, ""people always going try much could get away with, best answer better public policy take burden people.""

As long COVID there, waiting us fuck let get back exponential growth curve, people going struggle. Eventually they'd crack, whether took bad weather wanting see people holidays thinking virus hoax, sort immutable fact people going behave way. also say immutable fact Trump going behave way, I'd say productive look Trump wrong general public wrong. general public changing time soon, amount messaging prevented massive spikes western nation opted type strategy. change playbook future (hopefully competent) leader.

If instead pushed people much harder start (e.g. much harder, shorter lockdown), employed successful mass testing/contact tracing program, really could moved needle. Asking individuals ""do better"" effective scenario.

Doctors nurses ask patients go diets every day. Collectively we've gotten fatter.

Scientists ask people cut polluting activities every day. Trucks get bigger, SUV sales soar, international flights, prior COVID, predicted triple 2035.

Strategies work public health purposes ones compel people make right choice, ones strongly encourage so. someone holding gunpoint house? I've seen friends family, safe distance. I've gone places, done things safe. Like dumb lazy figured live life this. zero sympathy can't figure out. Assuming talking US, hospitalizations definitely flat (CO) rising (MI) areas. myth this? kind shuts misinformation people like you? pandemic absolutely there‚Äôs still 1000 deaths per day always rare examples like Smallpox Extinct late 70s probably best achievement recent history available evidence single shot Moderna least good single shot J&amp;J. Today first shot told laminate it. That's completely misguided. Mutations happen random; mixing vax unvax raise them.  full-escape mutation happens, unless dies out, it'll spread low amounts vaccinate reopen find it.

What need minimize number total infections, (possibly important) cure long-term hosts.

There good chance full-escape mutation even possible. I'm agreement- wish could variant-updated vaccines. COVID news. Go home media voyeurs Maybe next spring, idk we'll shots Thanksgiving. Check www.Vaccinefinder.com. filter drug looking see what's different locations. Definitely might change time get appointment though. Victoria got cluster spawned northern beaches cluster. read that? Apart mistake concentration shots trial, nothing real interest talk safety efficacy. managed well end. 

All issues contacts whatever related that. Halting vaccine big mistake without sound reasons it. hurts whole fight covid-19 live Brisbane, I‚Äôm happy take precautions days order continue enjoy freedom we‚Äôve past 9 months. can‚Äôt speak everyone, general sentiment people I‚Äôve discussed similar. vaccinated, fine! reference, contra costa northernmost part east bay region CA's Bay Area. primarily low-middle income suburban deal. implying achievement, big ones gonna Alameda (the major East Bay county Oakland Berkeley), Santa Clara (San Jose well silicon valley), San Francisco- till people bay gonna excluded availability. that's true. lovely county Michigan pace finish vaccinating like, December. Cuz ones susceptible already died. It‚Äôs done before. It‚Äôs three days. it‚Äôs back pretty much normal. It‚Äôs ok don‚Äôt get it, you‚Äôre different experience are, it‚Äôs relevant response ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è alternatives people don‚Äôt get vaccinated? I'm vegan got Moderna. vegans never even mention unless someone brings someone offers us food every meat eater makes fun us. comment example. There's uncertainty vaccine certainly partially protects may fully protect you.

B.1.351 (SA) consistently scored ""highest"" lab antibody titer reduction tests. real-world data B.1.1.7 (UK), esp pfizer, vaccines work extremely well there. Vaccines also seem work well P.1, though ""real"" data knowledge CFR rising Brazil every age group except vaccinated ones. recently new study B.1.526 (NYC) showing par B.1.351, that's one watch also. I‚Äôm concerned two things combined could make things worse states dropping mask mandates / acting like over:

-	young people, acting like idiots even though lowest rates full vaccinations. creates evolutionary selection pressure virus mutations better infect young people since largest pool people without immunity previous infection vaccine. 
-	there people getting first shot every week US people get first shot one vaccines acting like idiots think immediately invulnerable even though partial immune response. creates selection pressure virus find way overcome vaccines 

All takes right one bad break things get annoyingly bad again, unfortunately seem committed creating perfect environment bad news. get Russia massive amount antivaccers itself? vacctionation statistic may tell lot. Russia also blame foreign actors since ton antivac narrative opposition media social networks. Equating entire spectrum meaningful human experience, seeing friends family, traveling, experiencing art, music, everything else life offer away screen merely ""going Applebees"" completely ridiculous trivializes pain suffering many people experiencing. like what‚Äôs Brisbane Australia got Hawaii USA got story? Cruises trash even happened. [Honeywell N1115 county-run sites may ask proof residence work address, pharmacies like CVS Walgreens not. least anecdotes I‚Äôve read. understanding, vaccines still effective preventing death hospitalization. course working booster shots road. amazing Staten Island state. NY hates NJ take it. UK's cases (mostly) stop dropping? Monoclonal antibody treatments shifted use US regions (NY one them) became somewhat effective. tweaked meantime switched cocktail like regimens seems effective.  Dan Griffin talked clinical update either week last week TWIV. He‚Äôs man comes monoclonal antibodies. able get vaccinated probably fall winter, living metro Detroit rollout makes Pennsylvania look like Flash. yeah, I'd certainly ask country give another summer protect me. statistics I've seen flu covid similar level risk children. I've convicted linking sub routinely brigaded certain unmentionable subs like pretend virus magically passes children by.,

No, virus end world kids. also good them. simple. hope parents neglect health children refusing protect illness vaccine becomes available kids.

And back original point, stop acting like masks big burden people. stupid thing whine people's entire social lives disrupted. Masks done zero social disruption. even know what's wrong people. party week, another next Friday. shit, sounds really nice! county Michigan vaccinating whopping 2% population every week, we're track like, December lmao Animals give next mutation also... yet make immunosuppressants go hassle doctor submit paperwork state supposed receive special link register never did. call doctor's office make sure submitted paperwork. did. call 212 ask wtf registered me...with explanation didnt get link. I'm glad easy everyone isnt already dealing stress chronic illness though.... Hey Putin, might target Russian antivaccers propoganda, also poison active ones say got COVID, dont know, something.

Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Rightfully so. majority elderly people vaccinated risk increased hospitalizations deaths extremely low lot worse, keep cherrypicking though foresee another month sheer hell hospitals

Hmmmm. *Another* month sheer hell hospitals. ambiguity there, sentence definitely implies hell future. *Maybe* could interpret mean hell *once*, hell again, that's people use turn phrase. absolute worst, ambiguity OP's communication. However, common interpretation sentence aligns interpretation.

Also love shaming learning disability. nicely done. Many amazing doctors suffer ADHD (and disorders). 

As aside, lot people willing make enormous inferences person single paragraph two written website. I'm pretty glad people make sorts snap judgements physicians. main characteristics excellent care empathy, patience, course experience training.

Also, speaking turns phrase, ""flew handle"" seem apt all. wrote measured reply. Complete healthy people 50 still dying. Albeit much less still concern. one wants lose child. fewer 1000 deaths. 35 deaths per 1 million people. well Quarantine vulnerable people 

So, everyone? think like too, hate people dismiss away ""oh, that's slippery slope fallacy!"" always worth thinking about.

Luckily, least US, can't imagine taking hold. People already wildly basic mask mandates, can't imagine anything taking hold especially vaccines common.

My guess places passport summer, least businesses will, fall apart. That's even make passport then, expect way budget behind schedule like everything else try Ohio next door 16 up.  Pennsylvania still 1a. still need finish 1a, start 1b, 1c, finally 2 (16 up). Fauci today said children shouldn‚Äôt play children without masks, even parents vaccinated. It‚Äôs makes zero sense. Children 0 risk COVID. We‚Äôve gone preventing deaths hospitalizations keeping restrictions virus extinct agree line reasoning travel.  personally give people hard time travels (it good anyway), think less travel good thing.  left state reside well 10 years, last 20 years.

Chickepox passport? Mumps passport?  Yes yes yes. Cases matter nearly much now, especially week goes by. think Biden administration gets lot credit rollout - pretty anemic part Trump administration vaccines available. Trump put real effort working improving distribution AFAICT. 

Having said that, without relatively massive investments vaccine procurement made earlier Trump administration, might much distribute. make valid point, yet vaccinations. Wife 50 1/2 shots. 

Neighbor husband 54 ventilator (tested positive 2 days first shot). Unfortunately COVID ravaged him. wife works VA vaccinated (Moderna) tested positive well good news seems vaccine supposed do. husband ICU ventilator sniffles. would open cruises vaccinated Memorial day. Make crime forge vaccine card. unvaccinated people desperate cruise would rather forge card take free shot, god bless stupidity.  


Hell government I‚Äôd let unvaccinated people cruise agree get J&amp;J vaccine time boarding. They‚Äôre pretty solidly middle pack every metric vaccine rollout. There‚Äôs lot people want vaccine PA. 16 20 rolling average.

extrapolated whole US would 660 per day, number hit since june figure going get used boosters considering UK announced going fall/winter 70s still leaves much shared.

I hope least time US reached surplus doses offer J&amp;J anyone working cargo ship plane coming US reduce potentially spreading covid especially chance new variant. enlightened self interest - help others stops circulating around world &amp; coming back worse. logic this? mean....I've never heard this, get vaccine still need act like vaccinated. address utterly huge logic gap advice? saying thing. think percentage vaccinated could also used one metric (among others, since natural immunity also factor). agree. I've mine. Waiting second dose, due within next couple weeks. may handled lot covid well I'm proud this. miss point. I'm saying original response getting vaccinated leads years decades immunity misleading variants emerging mutating evade antibodies. vaccine strong UK variant, may strong variants show ability evade antibody mediated infection either vaccine previous infection. know information. Additionally know long someone immune covid got infected recoverd vaccine became available. think there's one single uniform message entire year pandemic. Much important bellwether numbers number hospitalizations, ICU admissions deaths. someone gets virus flu-like symptoms asymptomatic recovers, case vast majority young &amp; healthy people, concerning. vaccinations states focused older vulnerable populations. long get sick, may end something like bad flu pandemic would huge upgrade situation now. hate immune things never got sick Bingo. It‚Äôs specifically half-truth; technically true degree misleading grandma died last November. pandemic stole last opportunities see never forgive it. We're pace 35% end April, take consideration people one dose going higher. Hope really fight court Cuomo girl toucher ruining state!!! Cases certainly matter. It‚Äôs dangerous dismiss this. don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs next viruses evolution, we‚Äôve already seen mutate avoid natural immunity. What‚Äôs next? escapes vaccine induced immunity? 

With every new case chance mutation, goal keep cases low possible herd immunity achieved. one month ago florida rolling average 6097 today rolling average 4958....what missing? oversimplified.

In San Francisco, example, steadily following cases July today, *except* notable exception 10 week period October‚ÄìDecember indoor bars/restaurants open, cases doubled every 2 weeks.

That single policy change largely responsible winter peak here, ultimately cased half total infections deaths, 250 people would died otherwise. know that, yes. That's people still wear masks. every public health official needs stop discussing cases right now.

A lot goalposts moved reasonably weighing covid cases versus serve cases important. social economic impacts covid far outweigh risks data non severe case impact. 

And important distinction deaths severe cases made going foward vaccinated versus unvaccinated. reaching point logically old person died covid, almost certainly 2 months get vaccinated, people don‚Äôt reasonable excuse accessibility

In USA need start discussing deaths terms ‚Äúwere able get vaccine 4 weeks ago.‚Äù It‚Äôs simple declining hit hesitation. People right get pace, don‚Äôt right decision impacting life app doesn‚Äôt though. say you‚Äôre vaccinated. There‚Äôs private health info app. year 2043. /u/camaroncaramelo1 still wears mask driving alone. european countries u talking about?

Ignoring fact dangerous. sets policies like ""if saves one life""...

Who talking saving one life? We're talking pandemic over, know yet.

Neither *thousand* people dying every day. seriously understand people understand this. 9/11 every three days, crisis over. Yeah, folks live tourist regions well economically well pal. Great üòä still stay home. say people invite out. Congrats üéâ mRNA technology sounds like cause diseases future like cancer. turns cells virus pretty much produces spike proteins immune system supposedly eats up. wouldnt entire immune system start producing viral spike, meaning would immune cells virus free able fight cells spike proteins surface; wouldnt that? better traditional vaccine immune system sees kills? feel like huge autoimmune risk long term. Im glad got least one dose might skip second. Congrats! people take seriously thom Mass appointments impossible find. Consider lucky lol Serious question: much credit Biden Administration and/or CDC and/or federal agencies deserve? responsible awesome achievement? pharmacies stock, appointments, people signing get shots? done federal level aside ordering vaccines country giving states? Tens millions people vaccinated US. Exactly long plan keeping world shut down? 270 10m people challenge study shown &lt;70% efficacy Pfizer vaccine 14 days first dose - even biased towards elderly populations likely weakest immune response single dose.

Lol please tell medicines probably take new. seem know health situation lot better looks like.

I take painkillers China still held responsible. Vaccine resistant bold statement sends wrong message correct I'm wrong reinfection data based assumptions sera study done Manaus estimated antibody prevalence. might case lot people. I'm introverted hell, low need social interaction. even me, whole thing made realize appreciate more. I've resolved get often stop declining social invitations over. Two weeks second dose. Star David clothes level slippery slope. 

Why anti free speech politics mod team?

Will ban everyone calls someone Nazi well? isn‚Äôt stance, you‚Äôre hypocrite. allows health insurance companies monitor lifestyle choices increase rate accordingly, allows even pervasive inescapable targeted advertising crowd life, allows people critical government ‚Äúspread misinformation‚Äù effectively banished society... well said think appreciated. still understand anyone would downvote expressing excitement? anti government want, I'm not. Hahaha, pretty fucking good point. Yellow fever commonly-required vaccine, countries require require travelers high-risk areas.  Polio next commonly-required vaccine, requirements apply travelers to/from polio-endemic countries.  handful countries require meningococcal meningitis vaccine. 

No country checking shot records upon entry make sure MMR Tdap booster date, gotten annual flu shot.  US never show proof vaccination domestic travel go concert sporting event.  

I plan get covid vaccine soon I'm eligible, serious concerns vaccine passports - specifically respect data security share private health information. luxury chicken shit getting vaccine. need arresting disease responsibility towards other. together. fucking yesterday. I'm sick fucking ANTI VAXXER twats (not yourself, people like RFK Jr, Sheri Tenpenny etc) spread hesitancy misinformation trickles individuals, hard time deciding something easiest choice world. realistically prepare another year needing one. Yeah think cousins 40, health conditions, got invited jab week also issue tying reopening COVID positivity rates. states numbers complete reopening low they'll basically never reached. time controlled COVID enough safe full reopening (not eliminating mandates/closures, actually population moving back old habits), number tests fraction were.

Hospitalizations (with COVID primary reason hospitalization) deaths seems like much better metric. medicines market years? check every medicine ever take see many people received them? ruins ? Thanksgiving perfect time. California announced everyone 16 eligible April 15th. Even significant portion population able schedule appointment right away, there's three-week time period first second doses. second dose administered May, full protection start late May early June, depending one able schedule appointment. Pennsylvania recently announced everyone 16 eligible June. So, simply case delaying choose get vaccinated. Many people still receive first shots May June. Ok, got some? inside store twice last year. cant wait wander Marshall's reason waste money. mask, still :).

here's video ~15k pfizer second dose  ? surge = increase Australia they‚Äôre looking big events, clubs etc. vaccine certification, entry. postulate could see boom problems get addressed

That seems absurdly unlikely given atate things. Yes vaccinated student populace mask sight. 

That's said. get rid requirements mandates. Also regarding idea ""THAT'S ENTIRE FUCKING POINT VACCINE."" No, not. purpose vaccine masks reduce chance catching spreading COVID. vaccine get rid masks. think wear masks forever (except maybe sick, better yet, stay home). COVID cases, vaccination rates dictate mask policy. cases low enough, get rid masks. take medicines market years/decades. 1. no, vaccine clinical trial start seeing effects vaccine starting 2 weeks injections
2. study, tested study subjects periodically, symptoms not
3. vaccine's purpose producing antibodies, teaches B cells able fight covid. weeks months process complete happen days injections. forever? going wear mask rest life? Never area crowds again? thought read ibuprofen affects immune response shouldn‚Äôt taken shortly before/after get vaccine. imagine true? hope so! kids considered August provided safety trial going moment goes okay should.

Might necessary could helpful help get herd immunity. Study viruses tropical diseases military medical school. Viruses mutate become less deadly spread more. Unless man made, never know. What? October five months ago. might results vaccinated age groups, data often hard find visible overall no. infections.

I'm Hungary, far behind Serbia, total infections deaths still roof. However remember seeing graph showed among 80+ people infections rised slower age groups. 

So based two countries similar, I'd guess effect Serbia that's enough yet significantly alter total counts. seen clinical data dispute, clinical data is!

I waiting see credible results wide spread population, currently Israel's data showing widespread success, 5000 new cases today Canada population 4x Israels far lower vaccination rates.

If Israel's data starts look lot better time, great, today prior today evidence data show vaccine working well. aware local places going bother right?

This'll used like...travel. Google ""covid vaccine tracker UK"" whatever country want details from, get numbers percentages without even access another website. Saw pre-print Italy showed 15k v 10k ok. I'll link source little bit Ah, see! know people care corona (I Kosovo February). wondering chinese vaccine shows effects already.

Thankyou answering! Data contrast official Israeli health ministry publication false countries ZERO cases stop spreading BS

They maintain zero cases lock cities single case. success vaccination program cannot compared countries went zero COVID amount new cases Israel around 5000, however Canada 4x population less 25% Israel vaccination level

Israel 229 cases yesterday. weekly average new daily cases number (worldmeter inaccurate gives [even lower number business owners free say, vax, service

My . medical history private HIPPA, Applebee's get supersede they're privately showing store vax exactly you‚Äôre saying ‚Äúforcing others put something body enjoy life want‚Äù.

No, still get vaccine, which, effective, matter I've still safe. need vaccinate 100% population every covid vaccine twice. need triple mask inside homes stay forever. there's ever 1 trillion chance spreading covid going outside getting 60 feet someone risk big take. you‚Äôre saying prioritize county extremely high death toll transmission rate first mitigate aggressive variant? Like UK? 140k deaths 60k new cases daily mutated variant? aren‚Äôt eating gutter mate doesn‚Äôt mean country wasn‚Äôt completely fucked spiraling control. huge risk mutations country already transmissible strain would lead harm. Sure though, let‚Äôs get Uzbekistan running first whilst 1000 daily dead countrymen.

It's futile imagine 46 would done. 45. guy charge. pleaded people wear mask. 

Team red went insane rabbit hole nothing counter productive. Team red blue, virus affects us regardless ideological though. ‚ÄúOnly 13 people affected, seven died‚Äù.

That‚Äôs what? 54% kill rate? Nothing worry about..carry on. abominable fucking moron. Social media brought worst people assisted spread mis- dis-information insane levels. Meanwhile certain somebody probably laughing inside Covid-free palace. Calculator watches? laminated vaccine cards?

I may ask possible transfer official looking card get second dose, i'm optimistic will... looking interstate travel, pretty damn easy actually. WA we've one case since last April, QLD's similar good fortune.

So baseline, outside snap lockdowns, *very* relaxed atmosphere.

Plenty time. answer, judgement call. relative risk. Everything risky, risky it, really?

For someone fully vaccinated Moderna/Pfizer, way, way less risky, even community spread still common.

What level risk constitutes much? vaccines, we've ratcheted COVID risk individual poses one top public health threats world something akin car accidents flu.

If got flu shot 2019, went party, got flu anyway, passed roommate, passed grandmother, died, murderer? Or, part web risk entangled in? Good know, thank you! able gather online non-live virus vaccinations, use corticosteroids make effectiveness vaccines suboptimal little concerned knocking immunity! dumb relatives post bullshit Facebook, report it, Facebook nothing! That's people working career jobs major cities world, roommates equate bad financial circumstances. think anyone expects lowest skilled jobs economy ever enable live well lifestyle expensive places. avoided antihistamines like 2 days vaccine precaution sure made difference. Got play everyone‚Äôs favorite game. Allergies covid Absolutely. exactly vaccines trusted poorer countries, especially tropical ones. Everyone aware beneficial effects.

The world's least trusting countries regards vaccines ones like Ukraine Japan, widespread disease rare endemic decades colder climate meant less disease general. quantify it, also really understand even owe answer that. enough get vaccine.

I take 2 brands painkillers, either paracetamol ibuprofen.

I really argue take vaccines, say actually understand someone waiting bit. know fancy hate people. Vaccination band-aid CURRENT RNA virus. another one? need address root cause investing better infrastructure, sanitation better practices environment. Ah, 126k dead ridiculous open drinking pubs. family there, matters me. Sure, can't lockdown forever, Germany lose control tempt fate? See Paris. Michigan. Florida spring break. get Chinese FFP2 masks cheap Amazon now. Admittedly probably quality 3M, they're better blue paper masks. would know better public health issues, really? going believe bunch health experts cruise lines?  metric cases trending neighborhood neighborhood? NYC 8.4 million people need look neighborhood trends. professor mentions study says shows long haulers getting vaccine there‚Äôs negative effects might help make people feel better. doesn‚Äôt give link information study. anyone know study she‚Äôs talking about? seem movement approval, ramping 1.5 million week May claim I've seen substantiated anywhere. source? basically take anything after. It‚Äôs don‚Äôt want take anti inflammatory meds. took allergy meds including Flonase still side effects doses. agree, probably won‚Äôt happen way. Wholesale getting rid masks like ‚Äústatement‚Äù everything fine now, we‚Äôre finally free this, absolutely over. quite while. Actually, we‚Äôre probably going see surge infections start right now. apparently variant (Brazilian) killing younger age groups higher rates. Interesting! Thank sharing. think study suffering bit issue: date onset symptoms available analysis.* Instead, infection outcomes, *the date set date swab collection first positive PCR test*. Given likely time gap onset symptoms swab collection, observed divergence cumulative incidence plots infection outcomes vaccinated persons unvaccinated controls may slightly delayed. parallel, might underestimation vaccine effectiveness time window, since estimate actually reflects narrower window vaccine active.

This going strongly bias results 14-20 day window median incubation period COVID 5 days (and likely add 1-2 days seeking care/testing). Antibodies reliably form days 10-13. people tested day 17 would likely infected vaccine really chance take effect. Combine potential behavioral changes getting vaccinated (since blinded study) lot confounding variables make interpreting result challenging. 

This different ""open-ended"" UK research shows much higher efficacy extended between-dose gap helps hide effect. Claim lines intentional self-harm percentage medical claim lines 13-18 age group increased 90.71 percent March 2020 compared March 2019. increase even larger comparing April 2020 April 2019, nearly doubling (99.83 percent). 

&amp;#x200B;

 Comparing August 2019 August 2020 Northeast, age group 13-18, 333.93 percent increase intentional self-harm claim lines percentage medical claim lines, rate higher region month studied age group. knows much outrage Dominic Cummings scandal caused. He's replicate that... Anyone information taking antihistamines corticosteroids mRNA vaccines? read, corticosteroids reduce immune response I'm debating stopping use Flonase getting first dose today. Going call GP tomorrow wondering there's official data yet? maybe smart think And?

If cruise staff vaccinated. I'm vaccinated. matter passengers ship vaccinated? Thank you, see many germans understandibly tired goverments issues handling late stage pandemic, need remain vigilant. virus still much here. okay angry ignorant still present threat. Good know people like still exist. Hope well! Remember Easter holidays coming testing millions school kids every day see cases drop tired seeing sort comment. high risk husband. able never leave house people selfish stop big events. much curbside (groceries, etc) teach person. international possibly domestic air travel.

What things going require passport? No, guy part problem.

Just another doomsday dude lapping 5 minutes fame.

We fully reopened June. variants all? wouldn‚Äôt surprised social conditions climate playing big role. saw similar surge timing 2020 cases peaked northeast around May. That‚Äôs speculative. think NE time year people become social weather becomes nicer maybe weather plays role. That‚Äôs armchair theory least. Combined infectious variants, loosened restrictions, pandemic fatigue ""Why can't give another month?"" asks, shortly one year anniversary ""two weeks flatten curve"".

We need accept COVID never fully eradicated, come actual endpoint pandemic instead moving goalposts endlessly. many cases/deaths need reach safely go back normal? many vaccinations? Nobody wants answer questions. Sadly, propaganda. suggest looking vaccine global supply chains work.

Good luck there. Yes. evident data Chile. Even elderly population vaccinated hospitalization skyrocketing among younger population.


Chile going lockdown now. happen many parts US coming months. something zeroCOVIDers keep lyign about: idea mantain zeroCOVID living normally contact tracing. truth every cluster needs faced snap lockdowns. You‚Äôre presenting false choice.   Mine already looking like shit, figured better laminate deal issues later. also scanned case.

I understand make wallet sized. Speaking stats here. 8 year old still statistically risk flu driving car COVID lot deaths probably people ICU weeks month, waiting family agree stop death preventing measures ventilation.

Not ICU, that's speculation nurse. Terrific comment. Thank bringing reason sub. lack support government, blame people fighting keep business running. feed family. Speech results directly death. exceptions free speech. Walk this, fully understand. What's reasoning behind giving people vaccine again? understanding becomes less effective time mistaken thinking still effective, say getting it?

 never heard getting multiple vaccine Vaccine resistant sounds really bad layman vaccines need good optics. three fold reduction antibody binding sounds scarier vaccines induce many fold antibodies natural infections very, least would prevent severe infection. Herpa,derpa,do align SF weather patterns year, aligns precisely within days restaurant policy change. I'll wait. get downvote much. Lockdowns default mitigation measure desperation. one theory work presence uncontrolled respiratory contagion, absent control measures. Minnesota governor explicitly said uses lockdown broadly flatten curve pandemic becomes uncontrollable extent hospitals can't operate. makes sense. mean want keep USA safe possible minimize infections get followed neighbors biggest influx foreign peoples entering states, South America use lot EU thats sure. Brazil.. wow. seniors vulnerable group overall death rate drops quickly vaccinated. discussed TWiV multiple times. 

I mean, think it, makes sense too. give booster shots diseases, matter one got.

There even trial UK they're mixing boost prime doses AZ Pfizer. Three feet six feet... matter. real question enough people take vaccine. nuts. close. wait another month. nooooo. like sinking ship. finally seeing land months sea. throwing away life jacket get shore.

It's insane. 226 deaths children aged 0-17. It‚Äôs near 0 numerous things similar risk higher endure everyday believe him, I'm sure liver though. Craaaap. wife said heard good idea take beforehand took ibuprofen first dose. looked yeah, great idea. Dammit. least second dose. protected protecting around you. point get appointment get vaccinated. Wait really, I‚Äôm 21 high risk group yet haven‚Äôt offered anything yet Immunology PhD student here. wrong, think important thing realize huge difference way variants arose way brand new coronavirus major new strain arises. severity COVID likely result virus *novel*, immune system seen anything similar, able get running start replication, time immune system handle fight it, virus pretty widespread. means virus immune response pretty intense. One could hospitalize kill (more often strong immune response, clears virus continues wreak havoc cytokine storm hyperinflammatory responses).

As long variants arise point mutations small changes genome, lion's share mutation far, continue see level efficacy vaccines previous infections, blunt effect future outbreaks, even mutations allow cases become widespread again. Swine flu good example. novel enough spread widely young populations, older people lingering immunity past H1N1 infections, leading extremely low IFR. 

As long case burden continues drop, changes happen relatively slowly, especially since virus mutates slower rate something like influenza. able keep relatively easily, especially get boosters latest round variants came pandemic.

New variants like ones we've seen form *much* slowly case burden decreases around world. Mutations literally pure luck. good ones get selected population become dominant. imagine 1 billion cases year worldwide. gave us round variants. worldwide vaccination first pass natural immunity, maybe get 200 million next year 50 million year after. Even levels 50 million, would take nearly \~20 years obtain level mutation, much.

tl;dr last paragraph: situation relatively stable mutation-wise year. need big event, somewhat like ones led SARS-CoV-2 arise first place, get around built immunity vaccines infections. Otherwise, get something like swine flu, people somewhat vulnerable, particularly lethal event. Gratifying know least one country dysfunctional are. really crucial moment. can't terminate they'll lose court.

That mean start process slowly building file full reasons canning you. ideally hope doesn‚Äôt reduce efficacy Covid vaccine. We‚Äôve taking Q religiously since summer recently vaccinated. quick Google search doesn‚Äôt provide information article. would affect small percentage population here. Yeah sort of, knew MIL selfish socially inconsiderate likes this. became glaringly obvious sudden. got trying see best people. 80% deaths still people aged 65 older eligible vaccines weeks now. Deaths lag behind number weeks, start drop dramatically. i'd laugh mostly antivaxxers would trust it. vaccine cards piece paper, anyone color copier could make one... comorbidities 70+ PA. How's include 2/3 adult population? agree, would totally think I‚Äôm increasingly optimistic. But, county‚Äôs daily cases doubled last coupes weeks. Really sucks optimistic see daily news cases double couple weeks. sure. like chasing high. Desires defined OP. skipping concerts want go to, that's every concert? life punctuated events happens interim? mean going laminate, dont 2nd dose. Ah, maybe it‚Äôs I‚Äôve stopped working almost entire time, I‚Äôm really thrilled come home take boots chill :D. No, done 60-70%. Impact seen way sooner. yea still months away finish line referee calls off, gotta keep going thing One year ago vaccine passports fiction. vaccine. Israel IBM working electronic version countries.

We live real world. everyone demands they'll table. ibuprofen NSAIDS general? heard taking meloxicam daily got first dose Moderna. wonder compares North South America, Europe, Asia, Australia. judging, wondering, required Isolate vaccinated? County people not. point? difference EUA traditional approval 5-7 years study. lot protocols QC, batch testing, production oversight.  trials fir part hit traditional benchmarks.  Turns it‚Äôs easy pandemic raging. wife got first dose today well! Took lot hunting appointment (Chicago little behind metro areas), got it, finally. Yeah work state university told Thursday masks would still required fall unless things change variants don‚Äôt spread much. 

I don‚Äôt mind mask keeping feels like nothing changes. 

I‚Äôm also taking classes person labs that‚Äôs nice. I‚Äôm tired wearing mask. There‚Äôs definitely benefits. used get bad sore throats often past year haven‚Äôt one. masks help that. Yeah, pfizer. Soreness went away day node longer swollen guessed shot related. Sounds like means worked! Francis Collins doesnt seem problem devout Christian world renowned scientist. 

It sounds like follower Scientism rather lover science. get one chance this. Wait get shot break alka seltzer tablets. non aspirin kind though (NSAIDs lower immune response vaccine). responding stating virus natural, wasn‚Äôt original point making, original point stating isn‚Äôt normal situation thus people feel empathy one another, one went topic. digitized. things mostly make sure second shot matches got 40k cases 513 deaths. surge lmao Cloth surgical masks considered safe enough anymore implies never safe enough, even though snake-oil salesmen reddit claimed otherwise better part year. There's also reason believe N95s ""safe enough"" none ever studied anywhere settings (surgical) masks meant worn strict guidelines. four lines...laminating sounds bit premature. one replied comment removed. comments making original point. Yes certainly people Florida quality life New York strict bs rules mention cuomo touched 7 women want touched launched corrupt investigation scum earth waste human space right. less government control people. smart enough make decisions... Occupation lot easier falsify (and difficult verify) age younger people less likely die it. lag. It‚Äôs great see us dropped 40k fatality / hospitalizations follow terrific. I've got 2 Pfizer Biontech officially cyborg. thought lying date, cause couldn‚Äôt imagine would *zero* masks crowd like that. zoomed in, find two masks. Date checks . . . still hard believe. 1 year ago vaccine passports conspiracy theory Again, fact. Don‚Äôt expect anyone associated sub get it‚Äôs true, mostly harmless. Source: dude trust  11-15 probably get Pfizer fairly soon. nobody really done tests that. adults hit heard immunity it‚Äôll hard test since need control group contract covid see actually works. fine! They‚Äôll fill paperwork though. got mine Walgreens. they‚Äôre not. Uptake very, high. Kate Bingham thank vaccine procurement came private sector... It‚Äôs cute think keeps safe. Thanks doubling getting angry. shows real maturity.

I doubt many clinics overwhelmed, degree overwhelmed extremely variable totally based staffing rates. nasty habit US allowing private equity firms buy clinics, hospitals, practices slash provider pay substantially increasing workload. things place regard staffing.

It sounds like works urgent care facility, hospital. Urgent cares tendency pretty volatile patient volume, could change baseline greater hospital. all, hospitalization getting help vaccines cases would show urgent care rise. one disagree with. verifiable facts, New York fewer COVID-19 deaths per 100k people Florida, despite 500k people 13% less land mass socially distance with. Cuomo absolutely mishandled nursing home situation ""ruining state"" faster people businesses defying public health safety regulations. stupid people refusing take them. suppose end issue self resolves. US going lockdown months. eligible adults vaccinated much higher rate. coming ICU much worse shape responding well treatments earlier pandemic. Still waiting mine 20% population minors yet approved vaccinated. way they‚Äôll vaccinated months. 

Not downer, we‚Äôre definitely way this. saying people died covid would died covid never existed before? clinical trials done yet numnuts. vaccines even exist year ago. another 5 7 years well grounded research achieved. sore lymph node week second dose

Common side effect mRNA vaccines. sure vaccines. ""Children 0 risk COVID.""

Please tell 8 year old niece awful time tonight barely able breathe Covid. Damn man, think speak. EU signed deal later UK

I'm getting really tired this. debunked extensively. 19-22 college least form socialization. 13-18 stuck home. Except cases people hospitalized 50 rising states variants prevalent patients responding treatments worked previously. would amazing There‚Äôs definitely ton people waiting. heard Meijer week. signed back eligible due wife‚Äôs job. Meijer week signed again, since didn‚Äôt hear anything month ago. sure anything that, finally got call. 

Hopefully make easier people sign get contacted. We‚Äôre definitely least couple months away able everyone wants one able get one. kind feel like lottery. Whether scientists want not, pandemic people. mental social repercussions lockdowns 24/7 bad news moving goal posts. summer gonna normal whether scientists want not. Don‚Äôt need luck, we‚Äôve got vaccines. actually happening. actually seeing patient outcomes worse age group earlier pandemic. See earlier article posted. Obese, elderly, people commodities.

I'd rather able pay bills keep roof head.

Suppose people killing can't pay mortgages COVID-related though, eh?

Gotta maintain TV people's relevance heckin' lockdownareenos. 2) long take FDA go EUA full approval?

I'm pretty sure heard Scott Gottlieb say Pfizer would get full approval summer. former head FDA imagine quite bit knowledge approvals. would expect others follow shortly after. think unexpected colleges require fall, lot lose campuses fully opened back normal. kids??? keep getting poked proved testing every three days anything? EU going even embarrassed British businesses start open starting economy again. feel sorry people EU way screwed over. That's true, vaccines work variants we've seen far. mean never problem variant pretending otherwise favors anyone. well let lawyers settle one. then, suggest struggling business owners like bar owner get new job. hear amazon always hiring honestly think still better approach opening up. lot people need feel urgency motivated. think waltz anytime, they'll keep putting off. like they're suddenly ineligible expands supplies flowing in. race variants need vaccines distributed widely instead clusters really beat them. You‚Äôre squabbling semantics ignoring OP‚Äôs (correct) point: Covid risk children incredibly low Fauci saying kids wearing masks playing one gives shit says anymore. charge what? likely never close 0. Ever. sad little people know many diseases actually able eradicated. someone Iowa seems completely alien nobody actually masks we're going inside public building 

Even work take mine I'm working outside staff area get coronavirus news updates www.creedthoughts.gov.www/creedthoughts. 

Sometimes data directly downloaded consciousness lizard overlords, scheduling really depends moon phase. 

You know, interference. 1. would want that?  
2. He‚Äôs charge thing upsetting? long-term effects? answer no, would excited position. NZ begin rollout December? barely started. fantastic job containing virus home people get tired it. kiwi please correct I‚Äôm wrong, guys seem lockdown week everytime new case pops up. unknowns variants, even person school. dont know vaccines effective variants, keeping schools going literally breeding ground variants pop out. children asymptomatic, keep getting variants (yes reinfected multiple times, dont believe look Menaus, Brazil) , literally reason want stop virus vaccinating everyone cut hospitalizations deaths yes, even stop virus becoming even virulent. 

With population tens millions (76 million 2016) children going school, getting it, getting etc.. literally giant petry dish virus get mutations. sure variants dealt vaccine school least person, EVIL, immoral, mutates type targets children (its beyond realm possibility). possibility alone children enough make people think twice, apparently noone gives crap kids, getting rid sending school. Good job parenting people... big corporations operate within law time. Plus, executive orders law. despite that, Florida‚Äôs death rate national average (even though second oldest population). OP sounds like one healthcare workers cares writing dramatic Facebook posts. Philippines boat worse. drive car sir? maybe speak parents 1300 children died 2019 hands motor-vehicle related incident. dare continue drive death machine threatening lives children! You‚Äôre menace society! GIVE DRIVING, SAVES LIVES Aren‚Äôt percentages weighted, taking account increase/decrease testing rate? Let's find out. Michael osterholm charge hopefully lock soon Yup spot, I'm starting think either gave away closed 6 walgreens gave appointment time tech care maybe time small business owners find new job then. all, shouldnt break law dont want get arrested in-laws looking two months nothing. tech-savvy appointments get snapped up. lockdowns little effect. Compare FL CA example. four years allowed leave house order deliver mail vote. US cards signature. signoff. way authenticate lot numbers (not bottle numbers) Well libertarians don‚Äôt like society doing, always stay home. New York fewer COVID-19 deaths per 100k people Florida

bro kind drugs on? dumb people would buy vaccine dark web? eeeeyup. thing happening uk, keeping vaccines manufacture rather exporting it. unsurprisingly, u.s. u.k. ""remarkable"" vaccine rollout Oh jeez... :( location first shot? I'm due second shot Moderna 2 weeks Winn-Dixie two hours away. I've lot anxiety happens go they're Moderna. Wishing guys luck finding second shot! NSAIDS general, again, theoretical concern. interact COVID patients occasionally, best possible response important me. Yeah that's helpful advice.

Since every single state relaxed dining rules, obviously increases infections. No, also likely jump hundreds day like age groups.

This move suddenly paint anyone young high risk hospitalized nutty very, very, stupid. science data back up. US currently ranked 14 death rate there‚Äôs significant difference next 15 either. Let‚Äôs stick facts. likely at-risk people though, elderly, like flu. quick question, supposed go second shot day gives card appointment that‚Äôs mychart? im supposed go back 8th (that‚Äôs cdc card says) looked mychart it‚Äôs auto scheduled 17th. never contacted picking second appointment since figured would go back 8th Even it‚Äôs year, unnecessary prolongation crisis would suck. Congratulations!!! Anyone else watching Sanjay Gupta‚Äôs interview Trump‚Äôs Covid task force doctors? feel like I‚Äôm anxiety watching news clips again. crowded. still keep safe distance. didn‚Äôt show proof vaccination go school?

Spoiler: good fucking reason. Exactly. Anyone worried getting virus get vaccine. Problem solved. . vaccine records we've difficult fake, we've okay possibility

Let's pretend what's going anything like crazy antivaxxers (most vaccinated themselves) opposing kid getting polio vaccine. far heavily opposed/politicized we're starting basically zero. According European Commission's numbers last week, two thirds (21 million) UK jabs available since 1 December produced mainland Europe, none going way UK facilities UK-first restriction. 

The middle finger Brexity irony needing EU production raise it, counters justification, I'd say. Yep. Things suck twitter controls democratic policy also lot people live NI work Ireland vice versa. 

It‚Äôs uks land border, it‚Äôs 100% interest UK government fight covid Ireland, anywhere else world. 

I honestly don‚Äôt know much border policed moment majority border isolated countryside, there‚Äôs way preventing people slipping through. really going happen? Who's going tell? Who's going care?

Localized vaccine passports longterm unneeded one care. im giving financial advice. saying people shouldnt emergency fund emergencies lol Oh yeah, forgot titers. didnt even know titer ask doctor :) Well that‚Äôs one way ignore past year. Feel ya im wondering really paid.. yeah Fauci CDC need stop moving goalposts ‚Äúgoner‚Äù. 

You nothing constant hyperbole, hysterics, histrionics. I'm sure getting statistics New York much higher death total Florida higher per capita death rate despite Florida older population. links data. expect get downvoted I'd prefer someone show different data refute it. world living in? think small business owners rolling cash? 

In 2-3 months basically bottomed enough US free might end spending what's left Summer, Fall, Winter snow hits house every day find reason 

Especially since paid car disposable income back pockets Maybe get dot matrix stamped tattoo? know poor country compatibility. Don‚Äôt like business burned socially ostracized? Wear star around neck renounce rights  stealing everybody goes ass tits UK USA good. simply vaccines hell vaccinate people.. Same. addition usual vaccines, needed titers chicken pox since actual chicken pox vaccine, plus TB test, year school. US, earlier Brazil. Tell parents dead children. ok? Good question, told isolate 10 days works VA handles PTSD cases therapist. precaution imagine. cares? statement completely false Children 0 percent risk covid. wish people would stop making thin air. see people like still hide basements. I‚Äôd take picture info lot vaccines case ever needed. Say find bad batch something.

If info don‚Äôt see couldn‚Äôt download blank one CDC website fill information really needed physical card.  Unless living rock, probably heard search engines Google, Bing, Yahoo, etc. hard search? Instead pointing fingers people using Indian number system, educate yourself?

Also, way estimate. 5.94 crore ‚â† 6 thousand. 5.94 x 10,000,000 = 59,400,000. vaccinated exposed generally advised need quarantine unless develop symptoms. develop symptoms test positive quarantine then. show vaccine info get schools. 

This isn‚Äôt scary new thing. ok. assuming China knew since December said nothing (all CNN piece) explain knew since March 2020 still nothing allowed misinformation 500,000 deaths? mean... 9 months failures bleach maskless political rallies difference could've made knew December? soon point fingers pointing fingers China (even understandable) sure make finger pointing fair game... THEM. statement FALSE, Children 0 risk Covid. stop spreading misinformation. That‚Äôs alarming article, thanks sharing. Hopefully people take seriously, likely denial downvotes. likely heading towards kind scenario, anything even remotely close it, keep clutching pears. live state high counts people refusing shot, they‚Äôre saying maybe 30% state refuse I‚Äôm looking like matter I‚Äôll always risk. started living totally normal again, can‚Äôt wait everyone. shot that‚Äôs good enough. people figure libertarianism bullshit hit real world. 

Just interesting observation. never late bar owner skip latte every day build emergency fund can‚Äôt even get states agree masks. There‚Äôs way turns that. ...? can't speak state city mine able get appointment day finding I'm eligible, minimum 20-30 day left. seems hard argue vaccine high risk tried get vaccine least based state. Maybe others different batch number valid fake sign off

The black market vaccines almost definitely won‚Äôt come vaccine card doctor sign off.

Which means one unused slot batch number. (There 5/6 slot per batch number amount doses)

Not sure want buy vaccine card buy vaccine tho. idea pa isnt moving eligibility tier faster numbers areas great. last 7 days, pa #1 state whole country terms many shots administered per capita 1.29%. means last week, pa vaccinated 1.29% whole population day. comparison, texas 0.66%, florida 0.72%, ohio 0.87%. terms many people pa vaccinated, pa also pretty middle pack 30% least 1 shot Chile pretty low penetration covid compared US. US already \~35% population infected close 40% least one dose vaccination (obv overlap).  think we're much along chile terms total protection even though chile moving fast vaccination efforts. Hopefully surge short lived them. expect US see mild surge going middle/end april retract. matters kids 16 can‚Äôt get vaccinated won‚Äôt time. we‚Äôre going keep covid cases society whole person school need figure safe way possible. ...is there? trying justify conspiracy? flair people post lockdown skeptics subs sort bullshit misinformation easily. 19 deaths city Brazil getting almost daily. city 600k population. That's great way end unemployed. also bad idea general. one likes jackass. Italy one common slogans last spring 'ne usciremo migliori', we'll exit (this crisis) better people.

It age well. social security number is...

So what's big deal? 34,000 died flu '19.

500,000 died COVID last year. mounting world‚Äôs fastest per-capita Covid-19 vaccination campaign, 

Nice job trails Israel UAE vaccine doses per 100 inhabitants worldwide,
 
So fastest per capita? 

I impressed Chile though. I'm South America expect country great early vaccine much less near top. took mine strong immune response times. weren‚Äôt telling everyone take yet got mine üòí This. can‚Äôt look 50% social group ever again. wanted slap across face (aka didn‚Äôt fly Jamaica 30th birthday turn 30 middle worst part pandemic no, aren‚Äôt except quarantine get back stand 10 feet apart double mask inside - course got Covid passed bunch people) 

Showed selfish selfless people. made sad. Sucks. never said It‚Äôs sad people felt acceptable resort violence disagreed someone spent years field. Life relatively normal UK July-August presumably. Chin up! hope time next year things mostly back normal. Also, hope vaccines safe long term. Dammit Randy... opened everyone 18 today. grins giggles pulled local grocery store. get two hours now. One local pharmacies get tomorrow. local health department get 6 hrs. place can't get seems local Walmart. US they've always done thing they'll vaccinate anyone end day leftovers. chronically ill make pretty good stab - hard avoid depression do. Maybe pandemic could make people little tolerant sick disabled glimpse people's normalcy. Meanwhile countries Europe fighting third wave daily cases :/ group 4 6 GP flagged you, change unless GP takes action. understand downvotes. burial destruction cultural icons art? disagree. shouldn‚Äôt look things like ‚Äúrisk factors.‚Äù Everybody avoid catching covid, period... whether ‚Äúlow‚Äù ‚Äúhigh‚Äù risk. haven‚Äôt vaccinated yet, avoiding covid exposure. point it‚Äôs ‚ÄúOK‚Äù catch covid. Yup, live real world. one variable uncertain future. What? won‚Äôt ‚Äî schools open year üö´üß† meet 2 criteria GP flagged can't book NHS I'm inclined think COVID leaked Level 4 BSL performing Gain Function research bat coronaviruses using funding NIAID approved Dr. Fauci, carrying CCP's water lose funding. well put summary feelings situation too. opinion over, don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs ‚Äúover‚Äù every American adult opportunity vaccinated want it. point, risk you, it‚Äôs longer society‚Äôs responsibility protect risk. means it‚Äôs over. 

I would add one thing though. strongly dislike argument stay restricted threat variants, need wait case count super low get lives back. think TERRIBLE precedent set. Concern variants going away time soon. living long, long time. countries world won‚Äôt even begun vaccinating time US done it. Covid continue rampage countries probably years years come. always risk threatening variants emerging cases. variants going argument staying restricted, we‚Äôre going living like long, long time, personal herd immunity going fix that. Flooding place virus widespread people near-zero risk contracting spreading virus actually way fight pandemic. Good news around. 100% agreed. Well luckily single important document lives, social security cards numbers absolutely security obscure.

We really develop actual National ID card / number. find main argument one ridiculous. actual amount public documented tracking government already card isn‚Äôt going make difference. give digital card record? Wasnt Greece basically martial law whole time? laws allowed leave house like year.  ""JuSt fLU bRo!"" hospitalizations up! Get clue man. vulnerable vaccinated.

You realize we‚Äôre done vaccinating age group US, yet? I‚Äôm bit suspect reading comprehension. point don‚Äôt need mitigate deaths, never have. Doomed idea staying lockdown deaths all. They‚Äôre also exceedingly unlikely experience moderate severe Covid symptoms. Covid 100% spreading schools it‚Äôs minor blends minor respiratory illnesses goes undiagnosed Okay thought one. Everyone around like I‚Äôm going every over. I‚Äôm travelling here, there! Even husband million one plans 

I‚Äôm corner feeling overwhelmed even idea. I‚Äôm like like go back slowly something? minority liking idea going maybe twice week still spending time home. Nice little balance?

I love don‚Äôt get wrong I‚Äôve also loved home saving money dealing idiots there. don‚Äôt miss sitting restaurants, don‚Äôt miss bars, don‚Äôt miss anything requires small talk sit loud spaces long. 

I would socializing nights pre Covid. I‚Äôve discovered I‚Äôm quite introvert makes sense tired everytime would get home never felt like body rested (I barely drank - people things). 

I‚Äôm going alone home everyone losing minds partying up. I‚Äôll probably end folding due Como regretting it. I‚Äôm hoping get system mid summer calm down

I want go see family won‚Äôt happen till end year due home country slow Covid vaccines restrictions advocating for? asked question. I‚Äôm assuming answer question yes, let kids die Covid fewer flu.

It‚Äôs pointless criticize advocating deaths well known virus vaccinations snd effective treatments. 

This remains largely unknown virus variants know even less about. Staten Island like North North Florida.  Yes are, didn‚Äôt even get damn sticker Vaccines prevent virus, prevent death intense hospitalizations. Would go stand room 200 people flu? hope so. doubt though, shortages, problems scandals way. We'll next year saying old shit, doubt. Look, I'll say - small business trouble paying minimum wage staying afloat deserve exist point; enjoying using employees indentured servants reaping benefits it.

Also, America set wonderful Capitalist system, almost impossible even come close ""competitive"" many massive corporations given whatever want, including recent small business-PPP loans.

So easy deride small businesses fair nothing Country facilitate ability large-scale savings account, must less room get there. Nice strawman, keep stared second graph long realized March left.  late year, wonder? :( CASES issue vulnerable vaccinated. Deaths hospitalizations matter, numbers (relative total population) still low places

Vaccines proven effective variants there, especially UK variant. look data Israel, UK variant common. issue, vaccine still well 90% effective brother got second dose. gave new card second dose. two cards, one first one second. Neither name either. write personal information. Bro post /r/comicbooks üòÇüòÇ Targeted party Law Order. tried national booking site again? people added takes minutes look. Pennsylvania still stuck smokers obese. Thanks, Rachel!  likely immune already shall see Worth trying though, people added. poll really representative anyway. question asked 15th 18th March, vaccine suspended EMA's positive conclusion.  Could open time Euro's kicking off. England vs Scotland Wembley 18th June magnificent. Reinfection possible immunity constant. vaccine dose would give higher level antibodies resistance variants. like vaccine really risky. yes - everyone tends forget already pretty high level natural protection via infection older children 18-30 group. fucking stupid, Covid spreading museums. spreading private gatherings. Everyone truly vulnerable chance (literally months) get vaxxed, open back let institutions run business Yes people smart enough make decisions, including pub/restaurant owners festival organisers want risk customers staff allowing non vaccinated people.

If want vaccine fine, expect everyone else perfectly fine risk present. aren‚Äôt moving eligibility list it‚Äôs like 60% population eligible PA. honestly given many antivaxxers rural areas screw it, ain‚Äôt going deep proving comorbidities rural areas throwing away shots. Get Ohio can. doctor site said following.  Dont post thing social media. Keep copy it, keep original somewhere safe. might difficult get replacement card. dont know ever get point, said businesses might start asking vaccination proof things like door dining traveling. Conceivable kids want kids summer they‚Äôve bored home year looking someone blame. perfect storm. There‚Äôs huge disparity vaccine sites giving shots. There‚Äôs many organizations running them.

Some areas shot. Others juice candy. giving Pfizer swag.

But long giving vaccines rest doesn‚Äôt really matter. Although wish visited one wasn‚Äôt destroying empty vials. would really loved one memento. Florida also hiding data arresting scientists still uploading correct data. Great, restrictions lifted July 4th then? single Moderna effective al? opportunity J&amp;J Moderna scheduled. course would get second Moderna shot ugh four weeks daunting lol NC goes back full k-12. 

After spring break I'll 28 kids sitting side side eating lunch together close every day. ton anti-maskers hard argue sometimes. Mr. Ossotsromo, wear mask day take 30 minutes lunch? already it? 

Yuuup. Fantastic, especially Spain rather marked drop perception AZ vaccine following current tier restrictions something like almost 60% people eligible vaccinated PA. WA, it‚Äôs same. fact last tier like less 400k people lol.

The truth is, lots folks Pennsyltucky ain‚Äôt getting vaccinated. Get rural area go Ohio. It‚Äôs worth it. one deep dive questioning eligibility, make process look ‚Äúfair‚Äù fact is, every single human deserving vaccine. Look way get it.  know 20s ended dad told second dose license anything wants right 0 sympathy extroverts. 

This past year blessed relief! Tranquil, quiet. It‚Äôs ending introverts going put horrible people like again. 

Yippee. Same. ridiculous saying things like loud. kids limited outdoor activities (pool, playground, etc) summer. complete simpleton would think corona came random bat caused greatest pandemic ever someone ate said bat near whatever. Oh let‚Äôs forget fact humans literally zero immunity virus never encountered before. Humans used bathe feces, live caves BATS. Yet somehow someway one ever encountered virus thousands years?

Proper conspiracy theory logic here. think every pandemic history released lab China well?

And lol idea greatest pandemic ever. Open history book. culture paying taxes Greece really brutal. visited, refused paying card.

Also hotel wanted make deal pay tax. Unbelievably corrupt. didn‚Äôt mention playgrounds. journalist added asked ‚ÄúFace Nation‚Äù host Margaret Brennan whether parents send kids summer camp without vaccines, Fauci said, ‚ÄúIt conceivable possible.‚Äù No, lost mine 15 years ago car fire. virus didn‚Äôt exist year ago thus one died it, go try say different, idk paying attention massive jump excess deaths last year due covid, people dying would normal times without covid, doesn‚Äôt sound like normal part life. required enter building residence...which coming. speaks people's desire grow up, taken care comforting authority figure, got us endless public health emergency what's going get us biometric security state need proof vaccinations anything bodily autonomy increasingly thing past. people try hide world, is, world gets worse. Wait 15? I‚Äôm mid 20‚Äôs I‚Äôve needed quite times. 

I‚Äôve needed mine register vote, get new ID moved state, got passport travel country, get federally compliant Real ID, etc. 

It hasn‚Äôt frequently I‚Äôve needed every years since turned 18. Germany took picture front back stored card somewhere safe found this;

1. behaviour changed companies learned experience don‚Äôt travel business meetings won‚Äôt go back spending money business travel. Sometimes travel - mostly don‚Äôt. 

2. lot airplanes indefinitely grounded never fly again. take time rebuild fleets. means less flights higher prices. 

3. Airlines subsidise economy tickets ‚Äúover charging‚Äù business first class. Less travellers premium cabins means economy class passengers carry cost fuel operations. First guys think US actually give vaccines away demand low? so, quickly could happen? I‚Äôd imagine us giving even 100m could really help places setting 2023 goal Yes. Also surface cleaning hand sanitizing help covid great norovirus. Covid breathe in, norovirus needs get inside mouth somehow. sure keep getting interpreted said public health argument made, one respond point. said data available support decision made. leaves made solely best guess political grounds.

I never said done wasnt reasonable decision given pros cons. absolutely stand fact making based scientific data fact seeing data support thst decision fortunate bit lucky. time leaders publicly calling everyone follow science decided contradict go script.

The country question matter all, brought US recommendations also made based recommendations experts virology, immunology, public health. Different countries different factors weigh regards public safety change fact data available support change dosage schedule. worried 4th wave?

We are. very, worried it. think longer paying attention. They‚Äôve basically assumed vaccines going out, over, it‚Äôs time stop listening.

Others seeing surge saying ‚Äúyes, see it, cares? rise hospitalization death go it.‚Äù

Problem they‚Äôre wrong, we‚Äôre almost definitely going see rise, too. haven‚Äôt vaccinated enough people yet make noticeable difference community spread.

Real world data Israel showed R number doesn‚Äôt noticeably decrease 50% adult population given area vaccinated, aren‚Äôt yet. ""feel"" different, numbers show hospitalizations nationwide USA fraction months ago. Events require excelsior pass full-capacity, completely normal, masks. Otherwise, what's fucking point? 

We got move crap, clear people going private events either way, that's spread coming serious? America, course (I think South Beach recently says all). again. race anything? Pfizer available one parents gotten moderna enough people? hundred million worldwide?? $4k well upper class pays vacation. cruise lines appeal upper middle class upper class. Well wife covid time kid 2.5 time even get sniffle. surprised Dutch church &amp; churchgoer acting way. me, unchristian behaviour both. Dutch met really friendly relaxed things.  great, terrible. Everyone excuse. may fine. thousands like cause problems. follow rules don‚Äôt travel. part society. wrong. florida deaths per capita right vaccine appointments start getting unfilled. know people 60 struggle find appointments since current system rewards know use computers. know busy front line workers can't spend 3 hours day hunting slots.

But soon reports vaccination slots barely getting filled actually filled, right. kids can‚Äôt vaccinated yet. plan many cases allow kids, yet eligible, along vaccinated parents. Absolutely yes. Al gore many others said world would end ten years ago. making strides globe still people stupid crap bones turn oil. keep making strides I'm sure folks like using solar power power house bike everywhere dont you? happens return normalcy tied nebulous group people vaccinated (""the vulnerable!) saying you, individual, get vaccinated, that's individual start returning normal.

This also result pretending like vaccines effect transmission people less likely suffer serious case still spread virus people high-risk might waiting vaccine. low-risk people fully vaccinated, that's longer problem. I'm sorry, actually believe herd immunity achieve it, act like it. mean, schools allow masks worn since still stop spread viral diseases. banning masks would step backwards  Nah I‚Äôd rather get norovirus thx get car accident paramedics. Hospital beds. Pfizer's best recommenation 21 days second dose. Anything ok unavoidable, want close recommendation possible, reschedule Walgreens appointment. Much lower dose mRNA vaccines normal fridge storage. 

If demonstrates efficacy it‚Äôs possibly real game changer globally adding another easy handle vaccine. Same! forgot much disliked sharp pain needle inside me. even painful, unpleasant.

Pretty sure month AZ way delivering time UK. meant receive 30 million September 2020 example. Hasn‚Äôt traumatized me. really believe lockdown caused cases plummet?

What, want say could variants? I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôd disagree well. Frankly, think dismissive towards rising cases exactly bullshit got us first place. Keep downplaying lives disrupted families forever scarred though! Walgreens seems dropping ball quite people month. Mom immuno-compromised, I'm quite aware issues causes. wear cloth medical mask go (or worse, gaiter) wear N95 (and sometimes reusable respirator P100 filters, kinda look stupid Walmart)

It's mRNA vaccine, want wait see severe long term side effects vaccines. *so* wrong? can't want body without people freaking out? Moderna working 3rd dose (booster) That‚Äôs nice grandkids ordering groceries. LA schools closed year Yep, I'm willing bet they'll keep travel restrictions end year open vaccinated travel boost economy. evidence back up, suspect much difference hospital triage changed old folks need much hospital space. 

During previous waves, they'd send home unless rough shape (i.e., needed oxygen). COVID wards nearly empty, bar lower. holdover? follow. Pennsylvania still Phase 1A remains committed scheduling least one vaccine appointment everyone group March 31, opening eligibility broadly May 1, per President Joe Biden‚Äôs directive, spokesperson Department Health said email.

From article, exactly said. 
yes. Uk ordered first, pre-2021 deliveries Q1 2021 deliveries. got far less originally ordered, idea AZ specifically short-changing EU true customer alleged favour well. 
if can't see comparison choosing order avoid possibly change opinon youd recall, said holdover Nice. Thanks pre-empting non-American moaning Well hitting journalist car police next you, getting car smoking _with_ child going church really next level. right mind would see headlines ""travel / flights pandemic high"", ""restrictions rolled back"", ""mask mandates ending"", ""schools going back session"", ""schools allowing 3 feet distance instead 6"", ""spring breakers arrested Florida mass gatherings"", think ""I can't believe variants us."" Stay home. rest us won't. bizarre stance! 

And without even considering EU contact ""best effort"" clause guaranteed delivery, EU signed deals months UK, European CDC said there's millions AZ doses unused across EU politicians keep badmouthing people want it, UK put ¬£65.5m directly Oxford Uni's vaccine group help create vaccine, EU entirety put total ‚Ç¨1.78bn help create vaccines compared ‚Ç¨1.9bn UK alone ‚Ç¨9bn US. meant religious parts Netherlands, Netherlands als whole. apologies ambiguity. going google learning are

This Reddit, don‚Äôt Google posting here. procedure like? know I‚Äôll bringing ID/DL. need supporting documents, like pay stubs medical records? Also, saying state lockdown what's causing cases plummet here. say, ended 3 months ago. logic hold. look vaccine projection country country reach UK's current total doses given number per 100 population. 

That around 14th May... That's around 47 days behind UK (40 days behind said noises\****

Also, currently 58 days behind UK (46 days behind US)‚Ä¶ wife supposed second shot Moderna 6pm. Go walgreens tell us shots.... said put waiting list like waiting first shot. spend next day trying get second shot. no, different lol. theres massive difference purple tier curfew [US] I‚Äôm reading lot articles right fully vaccinated point avoid dining restaurants continue social distance. makes sense ways away herd immunity risk really great avoid going hanging friends? really warped lot people's perspectives. everything feel logical. I've slammed taking trips vaccinated people. people really developed oversimplified idea human contact bad.

When over, hope continue 2019 trends trying bring people together much possible. Nearly everything working world geared towards collaboration, better communication, face-to-face interactions. Obviously changed year, think change moving forward.

Social distancing lockdowns stop-gap solution pandemic anyway, something hope repeat. mass-testing, contact tracing, international novel disease discovery/eradication programs place across whole globe next 10 years beyond hope anyway. masks imperfect decent number immuno-compromised chronically ill people can't vaccinated deserve protection.

Because soon (if already) access non-mRNA vaccines. Okay statewide lockdown much different tier 1.  counties remained tier 1 recently. Even bigger drop go back another month so

* Jan peaked 1823
* Feb 1451
* March 343
* Today 19

Daily cases also simerlar drop

Jan 68,053
Feb 20,634

Today 3862


That's pretty serious drop, though daily cases seems leveled 5k range next big test next big reopening stage 2 weeks Nuance exists titles like ""Covid-19 disruptions killed 228,000 children South Asia, says UN report"" secondary reporters feed findings used fodder lockdown arguments. complex issue, way BBC article stated complex all. Whatever effect think has, actually opposite consider flu barely made impact, must pull extra thousands would killed flu, fit covid death. vaccinated afraid COVID. least based data have. past infection case, especially different variants avoid natural body immunity. press reports say this. However, nothing actually requires this. current *policy*. Policy changed stroke pen. 

I actually received vaccine Emergency Use, military, years ago. lawful order. people getting sick vaccine group exposed prior vaccination would diverge control group day two since numbers would include prior infections new infections. [mRNA vaccines spur lymph another one recently showed examined arm pit lymph nodes producing cells correspond years decades worth production. talking completely different things lol. no, state issued statewide curfew, called lockdown, november try stop surge. ended late january. thats lockdown im talking honestly thought anti-semitism first comment unintentional gave benefit doubt lol. Fuck Yea Pfizer first Feb March. know timeline still accurate, last heard far out? Please correct changed.

""Pfizer plans file full FDA approval COVID-19 vaccine April 2021 | Article [AMP] | Reuters"" Cope roughly every 5m first doses given equates +10% adult population. roughly 20m adults still go 100%, uptake tops around 85% that‚Äôs 12m people. 

If zero first doses done April 10m first doses would need done May June given rather offered ever adult. would 5m doses per week massive amount increase current levels.

The government target offer every adult end June given. uptake remains high see lot first doses still July.

Whilst it‚Äôs possible ever adult offered end June it‚Äôs obvious stocks available give first dose every adult then. maskless person COVID + Flu shot 2021 less dangerous kids unvaccinated person kids 2018. 

Chances kid dies covid low. Changes covid contagious vaccine low. Chances mask stops infection fairly low. think u/dakke97 Dutch meant say happened bible belt territory, Netherlands general really religious definitely fanatic.  Reddit. You‚Äôre either good bad. between. pandemic made people sides lose minds. Vaccinated people isolated followed guidelines absolutely travel vacation still adhere wearing masks social distancing. Reddit gate keepers saying it‚Äôs selfish vacation pandemic idea world works. think real world even way see state government passed stricter corona measures, Mayor Michael M√ºller (SPD) announced following special cabinet meeting Saturday. new rules go force Wednesday, 31 March. Here's key masks:¬† FFP2 masks mandatory enclosed spaces shops, libraries hospitals. also applies public transport. blue surgical masks longer considered safe looks like ""click meet"" appointment concept ditched Wednesday. enter retail outlets - apart selling essential supplies like supermarkets, pharmacies drug stores - shoppers must able show negative corona test conducted day. applies museums. Berlin shopping centres announced plans offer free quick tests site.¬†Here's info get tested free testing:¬†Employers must provide workers opportunity take free corona test twice week. Employers must allow office workers work home. Occupancy offices may exceed 50 per services:¬†To get haircut, cosmetic treatment massage, negative test result day negative test result required attendance indoor events gatherings (at least ones still permitted). apply demonstrations events organised religious mayor appealed Berliners take quick test private meetings protect others wearing mask. Haha people always say ‚ÄúMexico damage US drugs‚Äù, shit like fact Mexico gets legal illegal (illegal damaging) guns US, shows US sure destroying Mexico punish UK attitude? 
They're fine, vaccinated weak elderly. time EU think itself. Thousands still dying every day. sick recently sick, would polite/courteous thing do, especially cough.

But circumstance. reason sick.  are. main mass market cruise lines. Stuff like Crystal Cruises Regent Seven Seas Seabourn everyone spend 4K week one person. wish government rolling vaccine bit faster... feels like taking forever. also add, need large percentage population vaccinated virus actually burns out. people getting vaccinated virus rapidly spreading, would start sizzling 65-75% population immunized. doubt got far. dunno....they saying gonna another surge, lot people sub basically laughed off...but happening. bus ride site that's problem. This, 100% Aww, Chicken Pizza actually good news, right? means variants aren‚Äôt going render vaccines ineffective. Lifting restrictions fixed vaccines, variants harder deal with. least that‚Äôs see it, well could missing something Correct average 1000 deaths per day small amount. still almost twice record low. True. Wear mask public, someone shedding virus could make enough give infection (though chance dying would much closer 0). want go hang friends everyone room 100% vaccinated, it‚Äôs unlikely worry much, wearing mask isn‚Äôt risky. hanging outside ventilated room option, try take that, especially you‚Äôre hanging people home. Paywall =\ tried calling back? Maybe mind checking. I'll go OD get second shot till Friday next week. read someone post days ago laminated ink disappeared card looked blank. would get Moderna get whatever want. hard tell actual efficacy is. Seems 83% based Turkish study 65% based Indonesian one. 50% figure based Brazilian trial, likely variant-influenced. 

Overall efficacy would depend variants circulating population. Brazilian variant gained strong foothold Chile, 50% probably going efficacy number. not, higher. later immunity onset theory true, guess take another month see immunity take hold. 10 per 100k people die car accident every year. stopped driving riding cars? Ok 65+ yeah comorbidities said... listed comorbidities... mean even lack vacation days deterrent feel like quarantining fun people go week long vacation spend month alone (assuming two 2 week quarantines). Take picture save favorites folder phone.  Lock children reverse pressurized sleeping bag feed protein shakes Earth longer microscopic infectious particles. Older populations focused getting vaccinations, less dying. Yeah, bit off. ‚ÄúMiami Beach officers shoot pepper balls spring break crowds enforce emergency know virus works exact way vaccine does, except virus alive much dangerous. worried long term effects, something takes sense smell taste isn‚Äôt minor consideration. Chicken pox gives peoples shingles. 

Natural infection like natural poison. happens naturally doesn‚Äôt mean won‚Äôt seriously screw long term weird ways. Also incubate mutate one passed along new mutated problem humanity. I‚Äôm sure lockdown needed, even effective, think it‚Äôs bit premature party like it‚Äôs 2019.

I‚Äôm

We go stuff rampant indoor consumption kids

It‚Äôs bad.

I‚Äôd love dinner out, party, go movie, escape room, drinking dancing.

But that‚Äôll come. /s, right? There‚Äôs lot stuff lose college, parents much controlling ones life. Plus, lot college age people staying home sorta accord therefore little bit tolerant it. Like people college actively avoiding going parents told want to, likely fear. Yup. Medical staff saying months.

Just research since obviously doesn‚Äôt much applicability. ""If get Corona, get Corona,"" Spring Breaker 2020. where? Yeah respect that. I‚Äôve careful job particularly high risk, forget many working home Yeah watch video getting arrested destruction city property spring breakers arrested Florida mass gatherings

Given mass gatherings illegal Florida doubt headline run. referring Miami, traditionally criminal activity assault theft taking place much higher rate normal. hope would laughed room two years ago, ^(socially distanced) crowd people claiming stand science anyone agree wants kill grandma. Lol, no. jobs gone never coming back. government can‚Äôt bothered provide help whatsoever beyond one-time checks. already needed five masters degrees ten years experience get entry-level position outside eternal retail fast food hell, get compete everyone else lost job too. 
 
Besides hell wants repeat Roaring 20s? two decades miserable modern history. It‚Äôs going take people longer others stop living paralyzing fear. people baby step way. hope husband makes okay. awful two days go. that's awful luck. tell people there's annual number deaths vending machine accidents they'll say need another stay home summer vending machine epidemic completely removed. can't win here. pandemic legitimized entire segment population can't accept sometimes bad things happen sometimes people die. Dropped? We've 40kish mark 3 weeks now.  Things stalled slightly increased. colleges want mandate vaccine, fine. people go able get easily next school year. requiring distancing testing absolutely shitty. kind thing that‚Äôs making people apprehensive vaccination. lot of, people aren‚Äôt conspiracy theorists don‚Äôt believe Covid, haven‚Äôt seen clear personal benefit getting vaccinated. also whole lot people acting similarly post vaccine pre vaccine paranoia. perpetrating that. absolute furthest ‚Äúacceptable‚Äù go vaccines offered easily. reason go further. unacceptable do, require measures mandating vaccination. want believe they‚Äôre going backtrack measures fall they‚Äôll normal, fact put statement infuriating. COVID vaccines still widely available everyone, especially internationally. efficacy rate makes Moderna winner. that's would get. comparing 97% efficacy rate Moderna 80% J&amp;J. available take Moderna. always tough also take account human behaviors. Alongside vaccine rollout, also immense amount opening back happening. also building sense ""the worst behind us,"" ""the vulnerable protected,"" ""wow year, screw I'm going out.""

And lot sentiments going strongest populations least likely turn line yet.

So two strongly opposing trends happening right now. So....no Asian countries wear masks routine basis, generally concious trying reduce communicable disease transmission dense urban environments. ways attitudes freedom spread germs like old attitude throwing trash car window someone else solve. Michigan unique case good job vaccinating inner cities, risk live. comment got removed harsh

Im chef im tired people saying 10s millions needing change jobs lose income fine GDP macro economic claims stablish

I leave established kitchen good benefits worked way up, dine takeout doesnt work many places. Please stop telling ok make unable work I'm beginning get point see news ""rising cases"" misinformation least misleading. past year, we've situation cases, hospitalizations, deaths strict incontrovertible proportion. X% infections recorded cases, Y% cases lead hospitalizations, Z% hospitalizations lead death.

It's March 2020 anymore. March 2021 70% Americans 65 initiated vaccination around half completed it. X, Y, Z used be. case American 65 ""I'm scared I'm going die."" case American 65 rarely even leads severe symptoms, age range decreases approaches point statistical insignificance.

A new case today so, much less likely lead death new case last year outright misleading act like regarded equal alarm. might argue even reading ""new cases"" point focused ""new hospitalizations."" past year concern overwhelmed hospitals mathematically linked cases- case anymore.

Yes new infection leads increased probability mutation. that's also case *every virus we've ever dealt with.* alarm cases beginning feel alarmist I'm becoming increasingly frustrated it. No, could've happened without UK leaving. got vaccine would worried It‚Äôs half half me. know type though half people! Virtue signalers. usually justification it‚Äôs ok it. Lol - snooze lose. PA needs open mega sites collar counties. Way fewer wasted doses. Funny voted raising legit concern. yo chill be, major vaccine manufacturers, we're moving fast regardless. We'll done months. Seems like bad idea two lines potential boosters line needed. Adding us take immunosuppressants health conditions may cause vaccine effective (we know yet that's case flu shot). yeah, matters others want selfish POS get vaccinated. Still true decade later. Meningitis vaccine requirement moved 2018. don‚Äôt medical background. watch tv. Good champ. That‚Äôs even worse did. 

And saying something may happen definitive saying may not. adds information whatsoever. 

Call trace one actual case properly vaccinated person.

And remember time last year fauci telling us didn‚Äôt need masks broadcast news.

You added nothing conversation FUD. Pretty sure means natural selection.  Mutations efficient (i.e. evade antibodies) win out. NHS confirmed week set aside second doses concern around delivering them. 

It mean slow first doses next month India supply issue Sydney got pretty good. isolated lockdown one previous three outbreaks largely managed contract tracing measures. done problem Australia Victoria made mess hotel quarantine contact tracing caused second wave states willing trust contact tracing. Licked ? ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞) mean, mask social distance outside family/vaccinated bubble? point going good enough? That‚Äôs like saying risk getting struck lightning better stay inside safe. 

If family vaccinated vulnerable people vaccinated, let gather. I‚Äôm vaccinated Covid. mom sister vaccinated. I‚Äôm seeing them. miss 1 year old doesn‚Äôt know them.

We've enough made BS last year agree there. Alex berenson come
On down!!! Volunteer escort elder. get one too! necessarily mean UK's vaccination strategy effective. numbers may due difference amount socializing, could explain drop U.S. deaths last two months significantly higher drop April June 2020. look Michigan. That's need know. Elderly deaths hospitalizations still exist 30-60 age flooding hospitals cases rapidly approaching peak November/December. got depressed recently used one syringes inject vodka. feel like I'm things real purpose got letter-size sheet paper ""card"" got first dose (they ran out) I've honestly wondering what's stopping making smaller card-- there's line signature anything. Israel kept seeing waves 50 percent fully vax. end we‚Äôre still 2 months wording ""going select mutations"" weird. What, Covid sits WFH desk folders candidates Zoom-interviews mutations selects ones job? Judging vote's I'm assuming people believe covid airborne. according even CDC ""The CDC said yes, COVID spread people simply breathe virus particles suspended air."" Supply seems issue NZ. They're reliant nations vaccines.

They level system seems mostly political theater justify lockdowns. Yeah nothing 100%, especially pertains medicine. Still choice suppose, wont risk family, friends neighbors bored hate lockdown, 2% chance much comes people cherish. Let alone one could high 20% (we know) risk vs reward. day hanging worth someone dying? Guess that's question everyone asking be. Hospitalizations increase since lagging indicator, cases increasing. aside, trend hospitalizations flat week-over-week basis. drop 242 last week implies 35,843 hospital last week 242 drop -0.6% change. reference, trending -20% week-over-week since January. 

Within next couple days, hospitalizations rising week-over-week basis, coincides rise cases began 2 weeks ago. ship sailed gone last March. New Zealand cases locked new spontaneous lockdowns largest city every time new cases pop maintain control. cycle likely continue everyone vaccinated. case everywhere. it‚Äôs plasma treatment. Otherwise you‚Äôre fine symptoms positive test within last 10 days too. Man, got second shot stimulus check told husband patriotic duty go shopping keep economy going. Went kitchen store could bought one every item. happy - like trip me. Brazil saw exact level death increase cases increase age segments, something like 316% increase cases 317% increase deaths No, administer vaccines weekends actively. Vaccination general public start April. Hospitalizations rising proportion cases there's contagious variant among group people able get vaccinated. nightmare make be. math. Okay would make lot sense way interpreted it. Thanks, sister's taking Levels worried stay home study instead risking family's health. Oh sure there's lot nuance responsibility going guns blazing city another country. Bc that's did. Sure, say guns loaded, like someone else loaded airport hotel whatever shit hole crawled of.

You're entirely incapable comprehending misdeeds undoing. hope live short miserable life possible sad man. really can‚Äôt wrap head around global community opt egoism rather equitable vaccin distribution. unethical 4 months second lockdown

The whole ordeal like 8 months still answer concerns involuntary participant study uk government running delaying 2nd doses 2 months. Healthy people get sick time. Covid seems pattern ""underlying conditions"" crop previously diagnosed. Even young healthy people. Yeah young friends sat tables outside day dinner could see dozens boomers dancing maskless crowd inside bar. People every age irresponsible seems young people demonized reasons dismissed frivolous. go 8th, worst happen tell come back 17th. Oh ok, paranoid blindly walking trap?! mRNA vaccines there‚Äôs issue give boosters. mRNA would code variant spike protein, gets presented immune cells destroyed, done. (Also, general record, enter cell nucleus cannot interact DNA.). viral vector vaccines, bit complicated regards booster vaccinations since body *also* mounts immune response vector virus... thus subsequent shot less effective (immune cells destroy vector).

In general, vaccines protection usually thought wane time - really depends vaccine disease - wide variety vaccines (against many diseases) - think last lifetime, thought last 3 years need refreshers vaccine. 

This differs annual flu vaccine - really new vaccine every year, aimed anticipate changes flu virus upcoming season. Literally every Australian states health's department achieved complete suppression sustained zero community transmission, multiple times. easily achievable goal. side exponential growth decline slows down. [The effective R number growth stable since end January. mostly 5% drop huge number pretty big, 5% drop small number much. 

I know current charts look drop stalled completely past week so, remember many tickers websites use cases data reported, cases data test taken, introduces extra randomness, breaks data entry. That's period ending March 26th I'd rather look gov.uk numbers raw reporting date.

All countries expect similar pattern, least barring insanely rapid vaccine drive. even then, I'd expect Israel's drop 0 happen fairly slowly. Found JVT‚Äôs account OK. Thanks reply. keep hearing people say card required travel one give definitive answer requiring it. far, sounds like people wishing true rather actually true. I'll keep looking asking. random topic Facebook YouTube, there's nonstop hate misinformation, awful. Punishment? No, kind animal born coronavirus directly linked deforestation human development. reap sow. Yes take responsibility safely traveling Mexico transmitting COVID. 

Name-calling black/white thinking doesn‚Äôt make gringo narrative correct case. CDC says vaccinated people gather. Mainly I'd like able go back sports bar NFL gets going again. ton people waiting ""increasing evidence"" peer reviewed endorsed CDC medical journals. Grain salt otherwise.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* somebody chooses get vaccinated based random article, they'd already made mind long read headline.. Got 2nd today WOOT WOOT! Yes, recommendation wait 3 months sick (assuming symptomatic). ask doctor clinic plan get vaccinated specific info.   Love always accepted here, thank well problem lot places even plan yet. need start process now, restrictions things going back normal summer.

I fully expect see posts people ""defying restrictions"" June July without pointing restrictions long past due phased anyway.

The ENTIRE time social aspect pandemic ignored scientific community they're thin ice now, dragging feet calling restrictions called they're needed caution really touch unrealistic behave society.

Turns year saying ""only listen us say much we're going control life"" paying attention social ramifications great public perception non-scientists aka people. There‚Äôs increasing evidence vaccines dramatically reduce transmission. It‚Äôs completely safe vaccinated people gather I‚Äôm male, mid 30s, little two weeks getting j&amp;j shot, cdc website, says I‚Äôm considered fully vaccinated now, however state surge now, high positivity rate. continue act like I‚Äôm vaccinated, surge somewhat lower effectiveness rate j&amp;j (to honest don‚Äôt fully understand it), good go? least peace mind, start going gym go friends point say parts never it. parts UN/medical people can't go killed. Thank kind words Kids chance dying flu covid. think he's saying we've vaccinated 3x people contracted COVID. TF article? one assholes sending threats doctors? interesting. Zero-covid foreign concept US, seems almost foolish.

We attempting control mass weekly deaths, places Australia trying control instance covid itself.

What contrast. Yes, sorry typo P1 variant. Laminating vaccination record card totally boomer phenomenon - seems like everyone 50 obsessed laminating things. 

I think dates back generation cope flimsy paper social security cards considered really important documents (even though SSA explicitly tells laminate them).

It's bad idea exactly reason say - we're likely need booster shots point. probably even need record cards, zero security features - real vaccination ""passports"" coming electronic documents retrieve records directly state databases and/or ""(carte following standards. Thanks. 

I still plan getting vaccine good idea? Likewise I‚Äôm sure would apply vaccines completely different government enforced lockdowns moral standpoint, scientific one. scientific fact lockdowns objectively necessary case pandemics. bullshit it‚Äôs turning values (mostly, throwing money problems they‚Äôre solved) leading us via vaccination way faster countries busy shitting us months ago. 

It‚Äôs almost demanding countries act way bad idea?? stopped flu dead tracks. Similar situation CA. Luckily cases seem remaining low I‚Äôm hearing people age groups getting vaccinated. didn‚Äôt. lost virulence mutated seasonal flu UK began talking vacine producers MONTHS EU did. 

UK contracts pharma companies alot tougher EU ones. EU contract even cancellation clause. makes complete sense UK first AZ vaccine. UK govt pretty much funded research right day 1. US produced hundreds millions vaccines exported any

Also EU nothing vaccine purchase. private companies operating nation states contracts fulfill. again, trying achieve here? Limit risk covid-19 puts hospitals right? 

Inoculating 10% population, especially you‚Äôre targeting vulnerable first, doesn‚Äôt reduce risk 10% (it would risk hospitalization uniform across ages, know isn‚Äôt). probably reduces risk healthcare system 20%, maybe 30%. 

So depends mean ‚Äúat risk‚Äù. Treating covid infection 1 0 ages - I.e., 1 infection 80 year old risk healthcare system 1 infection 25 year old - yes would far low risk healthcare system. know isn‚Äôt case.
 
I think trying minimize covid infections subject constraints right objective. looking maximize opening society, subject constraint keeping hospitalizations manageable. think family wants come everyone fully vaccinated wants Easter dinner coming contact nobody outside group, that's fine. Well, case would like family. Everyone vaccinated. One person one shot, well, another got 2nd shot. question becomes meet?

In end, agreed treat like Xmas. clue vaccinated pass it, I'm risk. also want pass mother fully vaccinated. I'm isolating much possible, driving without stopping. continuing wear masks.

We would bigger problem sister came mostly unvaccinated family tho. school, won't, we'll likely make decisions summer. carry yellow fever vaccine card travel certain countries. much different that, effect many years. Thats pretty good, everyone ive spoken whose 1st shot previous infectin seem 24-36 hour shitty period. got fucked 72 hours lol It‚Äôs sub supposedly science. Naturally, anti science Facebook bullshit probably welcome. 

Seems fairly straight? regular ‚Äúpattern‚Äù though? time last year schools closing people staying put. year people taking spring break trips. much sooner summer wave going happen? Congrats 2nd shot!

Yeah got first shot noon lunch break, time left work felt like crap. Lasted next day. Day felt great! declare you‚Äôve received specific medical treatment then? Mods, need let nutters spread bullshit here? think it‚Äôs fastest vaccination campaign deployed. really put mouth ass one man never drank beer watching concert? got sweaty? never over. COVID going endemic stay us forever: Sorry, I'm US, fear vaccine passports that, since health data would recorded maybe shared whoever gets (like nearly everything internet), could turn Chinese-style social credit system really love CAPITALS responses - adds certain FLAIR ConverSATIon.

How math risk COVID pre-vaccination - risk hospitalization death. multiple chances getting post vaccine. compare odds norovirus cruise ship sinking. going semiannual vaccination Yes Shouldn‚Äôt cases dropping?  state OK, Philadelphia managing totally separate vaccination plan. Philadelphia county 11% population vaccinated well behind national average checked couple cities. New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, Houston, Miami way better Philly, city challenge. got pics phone keep original safely home. Got mine scheduled. Hats President Biden administration. Kind weird present continent though it‚Äôs comparison country. Sending love way. get better. cannot required.

Says That‚Äôs odd. live western New York bunch restaurants challenged cuomos lockdown restaurants. Went state Supreme Court ruled wasn‚Äôt enough evidence support cuomos claim restaurants spreading infections. open 75% capacity. That‚Äôs another lame excuse nothing. Spanish Flu spread around world, yet completely disappeared (with vaccines), people learned take seriously. one's saying anyone's 0 risk COVID. people risk others risk much less common risks. make decisions risks every time leave beds. (And sometimes even then) I‚Äôm tired hearing subreddit spew lines ‚Äúfearmongering‚Äù ‚Äúcases don‚Äôt matter!!! hospitalizations deaths do!!!‚Äù. Get grip reality, American people celebrated past finish line stand delicate situation. repeat lines we‚Äôre still miles ahead virus, sold truth country continued make mistakes best course current action would least recognize poor decisions currently effect. wish they'd honest stop dressing concerns. outside Asia because, now, go ""~~papers~~ QR Code please"" go grocery store. Plus, already expecting unpleasant legacy pandemic, like happened 9/11. relax-SURGE-relax-SURGE-relax-SURGE bought 3x4 clear record card holder Amazon people encounter? still viral shedding vaccinated, infect others. vaccination means wont get really sick, none completely stop transmission. Thank you. It‚Äôs safe now. Yes. don‚Äôt want get vaccinated find different school virtual. would agree sentiment. consider quite liberal/educated/ general belief science trained statistics. understand concepts epidemiology exponential growth knew back March going bad US. knew needed done snuff numbers low. also knew problem well suited American societal values freedom individualism. compatible. ideals great innovation business arts, terrible something like this. needed nothing approach early regards mitigation measures. still take classes online don‚Äôt want vaccine offering exemptions. Also it‚Äôs university. don‚Äôt want get vaccine go another school. honestly can't stand her. Robert Redfield CDC director might thing regret Trump era. regardless CDC director says going say.

Good. lost credibility long time ago. Link? missed that! link graph looking bloomberg? two see look pretty similar.  point, someone lying underlying conditions jump line way, accept vaccine offer get. state made mistake offered vaccine month eligible, honored mistake I'll getting first dose Wednesday. don‚Äôt see statements valid? Indoors masks spread virus amongst unvaccinated sick covid yet. New variants make people exhale virus particles meaning contagious. everywhere. I've seen people last days helping 65+ parents try get vaccine can't find one yet. 

When enter online risk calculators 40 year old male hypertension, bit overweight exercises daily, says 10% people would hospitalized caught covid.  Covid dangerous lots 40-65 year olds. surge happened winter. we‚Äôre seeing slight rise cases that‚Äôs it. make living, too.

Maybe pull bootstraps go get *real* job then. It‚Äôs shame nobody going hear it. much want bet isn‚Äôt even mentioned evening news tonight?  NYT analysis found bias. referencing poster talking about. Overall they're not. individual states are, nationally trend. 1,384,599 first doses yesterday. They're slightly versus last Monday's update two days decline that's good. think depends bit luck. I'm 30 Newcastle, got text GP surgery last week- one mass vaccination sites accepting walk-ins rest day. worry, lockdown ends two weeks, already seeing uptick schools. set third wave. Thanks. keep eye numbers change time. long would say wait CDC numbers ""final""? 

I made post here, calculated actual - 41,252 = **25,938** huge difference and, opinion, important metric tracking. get unvaccinated people sick, it‚Äôs individual choice risk  Take look Israel, it‚Äôll fine long run remember vaccine 100% effective. still rolling dice. odds contracting low region cases, protect venturing lot &amp; working home. instance right, masking unnecessary.

But slaving away Costco Michigan right now, even vaccinated there's still risk. Think like seatbelts. still buckle even odds getting accident super low. hospitals overwhelmed? No? we‚Äôre ok. Take picture it. It‚Äôs unlikely piece paper used vaccine passport even becomes thing There's fine line requiring vaccines attend public school requiring vaccine go baseball game. Yes do. They're owned people. feds working helping devise standards systems like literally hundreds companies clamoring develop vaccine passport apps including Google Apple.

I believe term looking crony capitalism though could argue companies free-riding issue get paid. Ah, _pas de deux_ France 24 declaring imminent strict lockdown Macron implementing one week later. dance old time. I‚Äôm sorry [this failure Walensky. Why? would say this? That‚Äôs complete wrong messaging. It‚Äôs unnecessarily pessimistic driven data all. part makes think it? 30% population that‚Äôs hit effective vaccine? stagnantion cases relatively low level part downward slide? Israel countries finding vaccines extremely effective variants? wrong messaging pandemic says personal views observations world reality does. clearly ‚Äúdriving Germans back Berlin‚Äù that‚Äôs messaging now. already point. state still 65's? said, unless lie people vaccination status, expect blow back people don‚Äôt want around people choose spread infectious diseases.

There social consequences too. 

You‚Äôve never worried polio, you? That‚Äôs ancestors supposed future. 

The hold outs look like selfish cowards won‚Äôt remembered well. 

Good luck. Every single bit data come indicates vaccines incredibly effective. Legitimate medical miracles even.

Yet chooses tone?

FML, wonder people distrust public health officials. almost believe public access information data whatsoever. American media done embarrassingly bad job this. created reality we're living right now. Instead informing people, cherry picked statistics information present scariest headlines possible, ad revenue. Pretty hyped get mine soon high schooler. Also teachers school district vaccinated. school district finally started hybrid school schedule apparently 2/3rds students preferred stay home. 3 months left school 2 days hour one long school. Also school letting free Covid testing that‚Äôs great. Let‚Äôs delay second doses wrap end April Increased exposure would significant impact lowering apparent efficacy large proportion control group getting infected. example, if, low exposure setting, 80% controls infected 2% vaccinated infected, would estimate efficacy 1- (.02/.8) = .975. higher exposure setting, might 90% controls infected (half likely avoid infection) 4% vaccinated infected (twice likely infected). would estimate efficacy 1 - (.04/.9) \~ .956.

In actual study, since control group get infected, correct increased exposure speeds things along. That's Sinovac. hung word ‚Äúanonymous‚Äù

Like journalist ""hung up"" facts? description deceptive. say ""anonymous"" doctor interviewed doctor right there, face, name last name hospital works at, simply lying.

You conspiracist circles, believed media source ""discredited"" source ""anonymous"". Unfortunately them, assumption false well.

So, again, no, random anonymous Redditor like arbiter journalism conducted, arbiter news medium source credibility, especially lie multiple times claiming defend truthfulness.

You also get ""up ante"" move goalposts determine perfectly credible source provided ""worthy"" enough, conspiracist death cult pathological liar gaggle ""set norm"" credible sourcing.

Stop lying. Stop trolling. willfull, pathological disinformationist credibility, least setting ""journalistic norms"", especially can't even something extremely simple tell bald-face lies piece text everyone literally click check BS 5 seconds. Honestly, wouldn‚Äôt surprised it‚Äôs work others events becoming commonplace. know 4 people whose workplaces started person day conference meetings.  Masks becoming suggested workplaces. CDC US politicians acknowledge this? UK got hit Kent variant first massive damage, that's variant proving difficult contain US part still ~1000 deaths day.

Also US death count bit suspect certain States (Looking Florida). everyone NY calls Cuomo dick twitter get vaccines administered end week. ARTICLE says lot good things going covid-wise we're essentially homestretch Need time. J&amp;J got EUA US two weeks ago effective stopping spread relevant metric math stops new mutations. roughly equally effective preventing hospitalizations deaths. fully vaccinated, longer need mask. people asking masks social distancing even full vaccination need fuck off. Agreed, there's much air vaccine covid related vaccine production US already exceeding 3 million units per day. time approved, America simply need it. It‚Äôs scientists like come airtight conclusions/don‚Äôt really deal ‚Äúprobably‚Äùs media doesn‚Äôt understand scientific method. Really infuriating. say end May. would give people definitive date look forward to, could big boost morale wise know end date.

As stands, we‚Äôre averaging 2.76M shots day. end April would mean around 60% adults 1 shot almost 50% country. May would 80% adults one shot 63% country one shot. 

Israel currently averaging 600 cases day that‚Äôs falling fast. would around 22K cases here. Israel 50% fully vaccinated, us would end May. 

I understand rising cases suck, isn‚Äôt winter surge. loud minority dragging LOL. Probably unintentionally ironic statement I've ever read think people gone mental illness territory. lived fear long minds can‚Äôt seem get ‚Äúnormal.‚Äù possible level risk overwhelming them. Hopefully, able rejoin living watching others successfully. app would track movement. That‚Äôs paranoia. 

What happens lose drivers license? fair can‚Äôt get plane go bar situation? Romania technically opened vaccination everyone 16 up, reality people within ""risk groups"" ""essential workers"" still priority. healthy 23 year old, knows I'll get vaccinated. las report saw showed pretty big divide states increasing dramatically others decreasing. wonder message would better received grouping US whole. 

Looking regional numbers, dropping recently plateaued (R0 values 1 month except three days couple weeks ago, testing high positivity rates 5%). people travel, don‚Äôt see area risk environment New Jersey certainly rising tears fears. 

While understand looking bigger picture, us look locally that‚Äôs going make hard relate anything says. Toss perceived urban/coastal bias, suspect folks around country even dismissive.  simply outstanding news. Like everyone else said, make new one big deal. take old card, copy info, discard old one.

Well, let tell something. nothing able halt temporary government program. reason people still paying telephone tax fund Spanish-American War well 2000s. reason Americans flying planes need take shoes off. pesky sunsetting provisions Patriot Act got renewed years. 

To argue passport vaccines normal everyday things life temporary belies history. fact, vaccine passport get implemented, likely expand ever removed. primary effect cars positive: allow us get quickly place another. accidents related cars negative side effect tried minimize improving safety cars.

The effect covid, hand, nothing negative. Meanwhile Washington....go tier system go! Ah so. pay man much attention went right head. AZ vaccine shown effective Pfizer etc. bad PR data there. also used 50/50 Pfizer/AZ. Yea, like Black Mirror episode. watched documentary back really got thinking. long norm globally. social credit systems without doubt future. soooooo exciting !!! Well well well ... where's posters swore see hospitalizations increase ""because already vaccinated vulnerable""? Yet ... *always been* Look Brazilian city Manaus, outbreak outbreak outbreak. Well, derives pounds weight. is, pounds (weight) sterling-quality silver, hence Pound Sterling. 

So, old times, would indeed weighed 195 pounds silver, 195 quid today's lingo. Huh? nursing homes impact cases? huge source spread early pandemic. Many residents/employees getting confined spaces. nursing homes way less cases, deaths freefalling altogether. (Deaths slowed down, expect continue decrease). Say 5 times fast. believe don‚Äôt want taking anything *before* receiving vaccination, effectively monitor immediate side effects 15 min waiting period shot. medications don‚Äôt reduce efficacy. I‚Äôm sure paper easily counterfeited. believe ideas digital. discussions believe. sure it‚Äôs set stone EU‚Äôs containment strategies pretty terrible well. Perhaps bad US, significantly worse much Asia. Combined delay take vaccinate don‚Äôt know definitively say handled pandemic whole better US U.K. I‚Äôve saying since beginning vaccination. would likely better giving people 1 dose trying get everyone fully vaccinated 2 shots. Hopefully start giving single shots everyone get herd immunity up. like J&amp;J don‚Äôt need 90-100% immunity virus stop it. need prioritize anyone hasn‚Äôt vaccinated Unrealistic how?!?

I explained post. vaccine approved anyone they're confident achieving sooner expected started exporting vaccines need countries, like Mexico.

The reason exporting Mexico particular vaccine (AZN) approved likely approved time matter US effort. That's crazy! work NHS something? family Lewisham Islington, parents aunt uncle late 40s (youngest 46 oldest 49) none either jab yet, they're still 50s are. certainly is. ain't always smartest cookie obviously.

It's fancy powerful card. card info it. big deal.

Defending position requires lying 5 sources. though (especially stop misrepresenting data are... San francisco county peaked early January like plenty places US).

Here's story typical flu seasons california particular... see usually peaks January, like COVID did. season absolutely nothing point I'm making, larger seasonal force play fully understand. Like OP pointed out: believing health policy finely tuned well enough one measure isolation change tide politically expedient... naive. like used ""Cu0mo"" ""the governor."" ü§ê Fantastic idea. makes sense. Oky lot US idiots coming caves Every time someone accused Cuomo something, either reopen something drop phase vaccination rollout. don‚Äôt think Fauci thinks vaccines take care everything, hes still preaching mask wearing taking precautions.

Nah, shifts ‚Äú10% transmission much stomach! 1 new case 1 case many! STAY HOME SAVE LIVES!‚Äù That's actually true, vast majority people either content current restrictions favour stricter ones (as current ones work well). one aside industry lobbying groups wants easing restrictions. Mainly people enough braincells rub together realise reopening would lead repeat December massive death rates... fair, least Trump made effort secure large number vaccine doses early on. good thing entire presidency. rest Covid response absolute clusterfuck though. Fear mongering. won‚Äôt ever get bad last spring. beat thing. People time like ""Can lift lockdowns now? we? we? want go movies!"" Like schoolboy anxiously wants schoolday end.

China ""zero cases"" still monitors spread virus rigorously controls zones people carrying virus enter.

You lift restrictions lockdowns want, virus left somewhere globe, make comeback country.

If want ""clean"" result, restrictions way it, robust vaccination coverage. N√© n√£o man, pqp. T√° osso frequentar /r/coronavirus ultimamente, tem muito gringo reclamando por besteira enquanto gente t√° aqui se fudendo absurdamente kkkkkk open vaccine groups. stop seeing deaths screen, dear CDC.

Not fault governor want make vaccine eligible younger groups. could care less boomer generation. point, get get I'm sorry rude view able go pub civil liberty need shut effects lockdown. say that?! I‚Äôm pretty sure one saying lockdown True, cases going despite growing population vaccinated people encouraging sign.  think something like ""if tech savvy, sign online fast possible get vaccines moved big locations every doctor's office able sign way"" needs reworded course staunchly pro-vaccine. said, let's fall fallacy thinking anti-vax movement right wing problem, absolutely people fall [environmentalist camp vaccine hesitancy also affects minority/disadvantaged communities variety 

Finally, ""things worse"" list totally fair pollutants things beyond person's personal control, least empathize someone concerned things feel control. Maybe? Although case I'd think would far effective sell vaccination ticket back regular life.

What get folks like MIL, part couple different vulnerable populations (age medical conditions) yet threaten grandkid visits went got vaccinated. There's *got* sort rationale there, I'll damned figure was. Except card stating finished vaccine course, could problem line places start requiring proof vaccination (regardless whether scientifically literate say not) Yup, like war. people want inflict everyone. Hell yeah especially considering think knowledge genetics. proven platform works expect mRNA vaccines going widely applied many different viruses target specific cellular structures. really quite amazing. Yes. younger cohorts referring 40....not children though.  article sub yesterday doctors quoted saying seeing younger patients admitted worse shape responding well treatments earlier pandemic. I've searching link morning, definitely posted sub yesterday. Deaths greatly lag cases thus vaccinations. 

How learned yet? 

You clearly aren‚Äôt informed covid. going pass judgement people ‚Äúknow‚Äù? Ok numbers?! plenty cases minuscule amount hospitalizations deaths? Stay semi restricted indefinitely? Rolling lockdowns again? would anyone operate business environment? dont predict bad last year. Covid widespread variants contagious, without vaccine, summer could worse last summer. vaccine good amount natural immunity, we'll fine. nothing outside home can't get online

Since unvaccinated bear risk. It‚Äôs decision. Anyone wants vaccination means go get get J&amp;J always mix match get booster one ones later. AZ study widely expected show mixing vaccines substantially improve effectiveness. article sub yesterday doctors quoted saying exactly younger patients coming ICU worse shape responding treatments well previously pandemic.  consistent study found respect severe disease.  I'm trying find article quoted doctors. sub somewhere. That's nonsense. everybody who's old vulnerable vaccinated longshot 500 Americans died yesterday. That's rate 5x higher even really bad flu year. blinded 1 party.

I even like Trudeau, keep trying. think one main issues conflicting signal leaders:

Governors reopen states virus longer threat. Fauci keeps saying vaccination take care everything. Walensky thinks another lockdown. NJ/PA need get NY's level. OK. cases rising then?

COVID denialism stronger force vaccinations. amazing study published today vaccines CDC instead talking chose say this. public health officials bad. Thanks real math. Oh mean fear ""impending doom"" scare complacency? Great hear. I'm happy you.

Over Netherlands I'm going wait till May, likely. think it‚Äôs long time narrative that‚Äôs pushed isn‚Äôt major factor doesnt pose large risk many people, mainly younger. result it‚Äôs seen many people urgent get vaccinated, especially groups they‚Äôve come believe it‚Äôs big concern them. though result poor public health messaging initially blood clots thing again. used approval people age 55 ago supposed given age group. thought ironic funny.

Wasn't deemed worth extremely rare side effects? seeing increased incidence compared Europe? sure issue people age 55? cannot imagine enough instances blood clots identify age limit statistical significance. case, another decision personally disagree with. Yeah thing cumulative effect reductions community people get vaccinated. addition directly 95% reduced chance getting virus exposed. Hiring remote allowing trusted employees go remote thing.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* sound almost excited covid contagious. Like disappointed people point actual lethality. Well could evade vaccines, WOULD become common US eventually. 

Luckily, seem case though. going upwards 99% reduction 90% reduction cases 90% reduction transmission cases. 90% reduction assumes vaccinated fair thier individual fear over. think unrealistic expect vaccinated people continue like last year. summer usa switching back everyone knows it. certain number deaths hospitalizations, restrictions lifted. Cases among young matter. Two first doses = S-Tier Alright, can't wait get back licking!!! Florida probably stand-out example. Lmfao. state Norway ownership stakes many country's largest publicly listed companies, owning 37% Oslo stock market[45] operating country's largest non-listed companies including Equinor Statkraft. Economist reports ""after second world war government nationalised German business interests Norway ended owning 44% Norsk Hydro's shares. formula controlling business shares rather regulation seemed work well, government used wherever possible. **'We invented Chinese way things Chinese', says Torger Reve Norwegian Business School""**.[45]

Norway's socioeconomic system: Chinese China likely also protective, somewhat less so. You‚Äôll fine, especially many people around mRNA vaccines community immunity benefit well. study done people 30. Amd risk death still 4 1000. Jesus Christ shut fuck up. Well certainly be! point really individual's discretion. 

I friends (young healthy) going continue social distancing second dose. others going frequent international vacations. somewhere between. 

It's full year. People enough information determine risk tolerance now. Smart equal good communicating average person. Smart equals smart. UKIP-vaccine? Presumably would super-effective COVID kills patient process. understand job largely irrational point. matters people getting vaccines nothing point people risk dying vaccinated. 

What people worry about? It‚Äôs less deadly flu them, they‚Äôre taking care flu - none. 

What else expect? got first moderna dose Saturday soon go back licking door knobs Dude we're asking wear mask social distance. 

If want either things - get vaccinated.

And yes selfish. actions could easily end killing someone, spread at-risk individual. Grow accept responsibilities life. Also important consider 90% drop confirmed infections would probably underestimate. simple statistics really account behavior: 3 2479 fully vaccinated got (0.12%), whereas 161 994 got vaccinated (16.2%), 0.12/16.2 = 0.74% basically indicates 99% effective also take account fully vaccinated people probably little cavalier behavior

(I understand say 90% study full vaccination numbers seem indicate 99% - probably 8 cases 1st dose......) correct order access vaccine yet ? Reopening decided numbers, arbitrary date. Everything wrong country history conservatives. Got it. live people ever going get vaccinated celebrating victory virus. people wear masks last year still wearing masks. difference phase 3 way people everywhere. good recipe new variant. Hopefully I'm alarmist high hopes ""normal"" coming back anytime soon. guess really depends attitude based on. all, like ""there's real rush end global pandemic that's kept people home year killed half million folks"" particularly logical attitude, there's got *something* behind it. I‚Äôm surrey, 31 moderate asthma still month away jab üòî She‚Äôs all-out PR offensive rehabilitate image. premature say vaccinated people restrictions international travel. Formerly known? What's moniker now? seen new vids lately. Book yourself. won‚Äôt problems, you‚Äôve got underlying health conditions anywhere states say YES. don‚Äôt know live find book in. There‚Äôs websites centres. girlfriend roommates vaccinated (and I). went girlfriend's place last night roommates drinking day. wild pouring drinks like seen since pre-pandemic times.

My instinct would ""catch up"" join party. Instead sipped beer played responsible one, making sure got water (and dragged one bathroom floor bed). absolutely desire go crazy anymore. best nights past year involved smoking weed myself, ordering take out, passing front TV. way Well ya, every bar restaurant super crowded now. fact cases aren‚Äôt increasing great, vaccinations continue start see declined cases - probably quicker imagine, Israel anything go by. military actually require doesn't. multiple vaccines full approval Fall. Yeah went door ticking names, said something like ‚Äúappointment phone call‚Äù said ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt get either wondering spare?‚Äù said ok let :) Lol cruise ships middle class decadence. Upper class isn‚Äôt setting foot tacky monstrosities. existing rules silly. order go sporting event, testing people already wearing masks social distancing. total overkill. going three games next week half test three times, already two vaccine doses (but two week requirement vaccine count).

I'd certainly rather app searched going sporting event AR-15's glass bottles fat fifty year old man.

The app came Friday - hopefully first step allowing larger crowds. Israel enough data point show happens 50-60 percent country vaccinated. Got it, you‚Äôre actually interested answering question. I‚Äôll take mean agree point. Right? It‚Äôs anti vaccine passport crowd, can‚Äôt happen! this?! it‚Äôs done decades people don‚Äôt travel idea. Greedy vaccinating you‚Äôre county Uganda? fuck good anyone island can‚Äôt vaccinate first ring fence safety net order help others after. Allows country strongest aid weakest , let‚Äôs fighting chance winning battle first. mean they're *wrong* they're never going convinced cruises safe. data know current vaccines work effectively variants

Actually, excellent data. never never be. fuck floating monoliths upper class decadence. Thanks sticking rules, Austin! Blaming St. Patricks Spring Nreak absolutely speculative BS know it. fake ones work scanners? didn‚Äôt read entire thread. haven‚Äôt seen scan anywhere test mine on. thought msg. Meh, first world nations done vaccinating end summer, vaccine production super scaled then. Cant imagine world third world isn‚Äôt herd immunity spring 2022. Yes, clear, believe vaccinated soon possible. Concern antivaccers will... antivax enrolling grad school, rather shock. yes, absolutely. theory works paper, I'm sure true practice. People thought thing early 1900s. era deeply interconnected global economies well, political scientists time believed preserving trade routes would enough incentive stave war.

Then World War broke out, opposite happened. complex international trade routes gave countries nothing conflict huge financial stake outcome. war disrupted global trade, gave entire world reason jump in, ensure preferred trade partner won. even cost war incalculably high, still huge financial reward winning.

Nukes stop war globalization ever did, took possibility reward table. winner war nuclear powers, means there's incentive ever start one.

MAD concept absolutely insane, frankly we're extremely lucky blown completely accident. credit due: *did* stave World War III. Unpopular opinion: should‚Äôve vaccinated mobile people first older folks. mobile mean go society everyday, work public-facing jobs, attend school, restaurant workers, etc. comprises mostly younger people 20‚Äôs-40‚Äôs. Older people less mobile, retired stay home time. know correctly vaccinated person form immune structures responsible years decades worth protection.

Source? Fauci said 6-12 months. doubting, want see. % growth cases due strictly increased infectiousness variant vs people starting disobey public health recommendations? 

We able quantitatively determine *exactly* much +X% increase cases coming increased infectiousness variants *exactly* much coming people disregarding PH guidelines right? Yes, course. College students already required vaccinations like Men B I'm fully vaccinated already ditched mine. soon June, without masks distancing. 

Well let ask -- would think PAX East whoever required proof vaccination letting someone buy tickets con? ""include photo CDC vax card"" registration process

Would willing take step attend event? Keeping mind that, since they'll need time authenticate vax card (or otherwise, bother). purchase process normally takes maybe 10 minutes, would take longer, maybe even divided multiple days can't authenticate real time lost China, can‚Äôt believe numbers all. 

Small island based countries that‚Äôs world, isn‚Äôt small pox. spreads easily, would great get rid one speaking ever happening I‚Äôve seen. Grumble grumble, might bite bullet. clear I'm ever going get offer without NHS number, seem possible get one without GP. resources used fully vaccinated individual? mean look reports BC example P1 variant quickly increasing percent cases Yep, reaping sowed. downvotes repetitive posting hyperbolic presentation, likely fourth wave/clank hard, numeric info. NHS said going problem 50? offered now. you‚Äôre 50 asthmatic HAVEN‚ÄôT hospitalized oral drug (excluding salbutamol, becotide etc) you‚Äôre priority group offered line age group. medical advice towards asthmatics changed , frustrating year told you‚Äôre higher risk. know correctly vaccinated person form immune structures responsible years decades worth protection. 

Not covid. way new variants emerging evading antibodies. AZ behind UK  Interesting. get first two doses? Pfizer one? decisions made based science trials. experts JCVI decades scientific immunological experience, wider science crucial element making decision.

I'd suggest listen JCVI said suggested schedule, really interesting print fake one, thread even talks easy is. ridiculously useless stupid system.  Social distancing too. unless drive Illinois State Police around bashing kneecaps no-maskers, nobody enforce it. Outside Chicago course. Lightfoot driving around yelling people haha. I'm guessing going measurements antibody levels get metric long takes full immunity kick in. First, whole scientific community doesn‚Äôt think that. That‚Äôs unverifiable disingenuous claim.

Second, I‚Äôm simply presenting data comparing comparable data. is, Covid death rate flu death rate. Then, simply pose question, overreact much TIME? don‚Äôt shut economy every flu season ‚Äúsave lives‚Äù?

All emotional appeals broad ‚Äúthe whole scientific community‚Äù statements wholly unsupportable.

The 500k deaths certainly overstating total death tole. Again, ‚ÄúCovid death‚Äù someone dies tests positive Covid. Again, die ‚Äúfrom Covid‚Äù numerous co-morbidities. Obesity, heart disease, cancer, etc etc. significant portion people likely die soon anyway. people (I.e., almost everyone 60) quiver boots Covid simply supported reality.

That‚Äôs I‚Äôm saying. meme. One day you‚Äôll grow old too, kid. Good you! People right decide whether take medicine, denying privileges everyone else discrimination I‚Äôve already got first shot Moderno I‚Äôm anti-VAX support freedom know big part America. want shut events safety sure can‚Äôt let certain people in. Cuomo got go. It‚Äôs think really lol. People absolutely flipping occasionally wear piece cloth faces, imagine telling can‚Äôt drive enormous lifted diesel monstrosities anymore? Ain‚Äôt happening, we‚Äôre donezo lol Wishing disease random person internet. genuinely wish well hope see hope light world.  Way better alternate one seem live in. /s  USA many strategic places invest. attitude. hope get disease eat words. ""Breath deep gathering doom"" Remember unemployment rate skyrocketed everyone figured stock market would stay extremely low, recovered record pace smashed previous records?

That's people actually ton disposable cash. Let clarify, *rich* *people* ton disposable income. WFH coalition (i.e. redditors office jobs) spending all, they're ready get let loose.

These people would fund boom anyway. Poor families spending tons money entertainment. funneling money towards transportation, education, car repair, etc... brink, living paycheck paycheck, much change financial situation (except maybe they'll established debt). irresponsibly spent money bars/clubs (e.g. low wage workers saving bottle service), continue so. Meanwhile, middle class young professionals wallets open.

Never underestimate people's ability ignore financial situation pay things want. Never underestimate ability economy completely fragment represent entirely different situation different economic classes.

I think we'll see boom entertainment sector. question really, ""how long last?"" interior coated sunscreen snorting.  Nice see masking distancing? Feel like might end disastrous. popular opinion around here, hit nail head. single year stop going bars restaurants, wear masks went grocery shopping people acting like dealing reality crime humanity.

Climate change, like virus, give fuck feelings. care mental health, give shit done things not.

The changes make/adapt last year going nothing compared what's going happen next couple decades, yeah, people shown willing needs done. They'll selfish pricks end. Pfizer applying full approval April afaik. least plan months back.  Ha! u telling Trump wrong ??? Basically two classes.

People well people didn't.

Lots people saved made cash cause changed spending habits. Yeah they're protecting boomers chart showing curves diverging ~10 days, dig primary data antibody levels (eg - scroll Figure 1) 2 orders magnitude antibodies 22 days 8 days. would say slow build time light switch - takes time dose administered ramp protective level, see real world curves diverge, antibodies increasing gradually course weeks. standard anti-vax question simple answers. vaccine 100% effective, first all. Second, everyone healthy enough get vaccinated rely herd immunity, third, lot people resistant getting vaccine whatever prejudice 20-30% people still spread wider community college town.

I'm forcing vaccine anyone, mean get act like vaccinated COVID dies years. Supreme Court USA held mandatory inoculation several times since dawn country. do? show asked spare? real milestone helping less fortunate populations get rate. vaccinate less fortunate. places money buy vaccines cant due shortages. shortages due capitalistic patents W.H.O wont authorize distribution make less fortunate areas, even fortunate areas means make more. greedy start. weeks we've already seen %'s vaccines skyrocket, 2 months least 80% states least one vaccine. multiple strains plan nice Brazilian South African trip hear best covid governor New York said he'd prosecute people gave vaccines citizens gave permission vaccinated. I'm surprised disaster there. definitely deserves kind medal embarrassing self contradictory handling pandemic, far know he's one write book great job. Jesus Canada slow. feel embarrassed. bold comic sans. Seriously. Roaring Twenties America rising world power limitless untapped natural resources, decaying post-industrial hellscape ripped half partisan politics. Party Time gonna 9-12 months people ODing fentanyl getting drunk driving accidents it‚Äôs back sober realization you‚Äôre hospital bill away pitching tent stole REI freeway overpass theory covid takes 2-7 days incubate. effects vaccine seem appear week. Since studies tracked symptomatic infection, wouldn‚Äôt imply vaccines start working almost immediately? There's reason aiming elimination vaccines. SARS-CoV-2 slow mutating, appears relatively limited animal reservoirs, highly effective vaccines. I'm sick hearing ""elimination unattainable goal"" - *100% attainable*. Countries - including large countries endemic spread like China - managed eliminate without vaccines goodness sakes. 

Now, *doesn't* mean can't ease restrictions cases hospitalizations go down. definitely should, restrictions costs - economic health costs - well. elimination endemic spread 100% goal. Yes. chance get registered next days?

Such shame book someone clearly 50, able go mass vaccination clinic get it. went first dose today plenty appointments busy. ok. felt nothing first time too, exhaustion/weakness second time. low threshold bullshit tired cried lot, really ok! within 24 hours Yup. try mentioning long covid watch downvotes roll in. people subreddit right saying ""You need eat restaurant."" making blood boil. want vaccine really making sympathize people don't, can't believe I'm reading. I'm God damn angry right now. Considering nearly 1/2 country anti-vaxxers would be, too. You‚Äôre free stay home then. It‚Äôs contractual obligations. AZ telling rest Europe cannot deliver promised vaccines different reasons yet seems delivering time UK. It‚Äôs UK stealing UK‚Äôs fault, AZ blame like posted expense rest Europe. Bro. people fucking social distanced like have, would back real life avoided insane financial person suffering endured. Since people couldn‚Äôt follow rules 3. WEEKS. caught fucking loop year. Look New Zealand, right, would love fucking music festival right actually completely false. restrictions loosened summer new, harder one put place winter Tried need registered GP. i'm pfizer recipient vegan watch kids Here's good alternative: Get enough doses need draconian nonsense. I‚Äôd doubt middle april. states opening 16+ age group then. It‚Äôll take least several weeks people scrambling get doses demand dies down. Even though we‚Äôll tons doses, we‚Äôll entire 16-50 population get ways then. how's life blade runner universe live in? 
[PA leading US 7-day moving average daily doses adminstered per 100 per 100 per day, average, ahead Palau, Maine, Samoa, Rhode Island. 
But terms share vaccinated far 1st:

30.6% 1+ dose PA, national average 27.4%
Palau 46.91%, New Mexico 37.11%. guess realize bunch diseases cannot receive vaccine immune system trashed. Guess people get fucked right? got J&amp;J vaccine Saturday 4-5 hours receiving hit massive wave fatigue pretty shortly thereafter developed fever 102 elevated heart rate (resting HR 120s I'm usually 70s). also experienced bad lower back pain base spine, radiating hips. I'm finding conflicting information medical info packet got vaccine. heart rate thing normal vaccine response? back pain likely lymph node thing? Wondering report symptoms government resource, also want waste anyone's time. Country wide mean every city/state same. average. ignore hotspots convenient. Michigan, mentioned increasing bad shape around cases, hospitalizations, deaths starting like said. anti masker stretch. feel comfortable visiting friends family  want people get vaccinated not?

Because government knowingly puts messaging discourages getting vaccinated, fault people get vaccinated. government's fault.

I'm getting really sick fact throughout entire pandemic, we've made tons restrictions work 100% population complies them. surprise nobody, see 100% compliance, refuse blame policies, instead blame people comply.

It's like banning smoking public mad people still smoking. like banning McDonald's mad obesity still exists. Unless restrict people things private, mandates never effective real world theory. unvaccinated people would choice.

I explained would case. Well considering see data ourselves, maybe ought to, know, reference ""horrific data"" sure exists instead spouting bunch bullshit. WTF right. happened stickies? vaccine posts gone? younger age groups grown lucky influenced nonsense social media.

Yeah. Plus, time ample supply younger population, COVID cases much lower (thanks everyone else getting vaccines), even less reason get (in eyes).  Yes. turns hiding vaccines secretly shipping UK instead od EU, taking 3 billion euros EU worked great. isn‚Äôt problem lot Americans thinking days

‚ÄúNot problem‚Äù

Which simplistic thinking, cause someone know gets Covid it‚Äôll problem. wear glasses, really big deal said one doctor quoted euronews.com insufficient source claims made. people obsessed making doom scenario thing. Literally asked reputable sources: academic studies, health department statistics. Anything. Instead get called names get told shut up. people robotic. HOLLA HEAR Covid much dangerous flu 50 year old.

And sorts laws, rules, regulations help reduce car accidents. REALLY want use analogy, making argument heavy covid regulations. Absolutely. emergency use. understand science behind whats happening.

I also certain risk factor. Im worried covid. Ill wait researched vaccine, get decide goes body. One thing found help act like concerned vaccines too. Nervous rushed, would safe etc. like ""after reading trial data seeing success had, Iv started come around, Think im going get shot now/decided get it"". kind leave without trying convince take it. 

I dunno, might work, start acting like youre team instead coming ""other side"" person thinks need defend themselves. many tens millions fed steady diet lies fearmongering working many hours research independently? get it, really do, end day evil lies GOP leaders, including certainly limited Trump. number bad people supported Trump, also many decent people deluded. think lower efficacy age groups problem.  
And wear mask required upvote :) really simple 'behaving' months, I'm sure world would 'nipped' bud. antivaxxers would contend measles also merely contagious disease.

In fact, measles death count pre-vaccine much higher covid despite enormously large R0 (12-18 compared Covid's 2-4). death count also 1920s-50s technology arguable measles less lethal covid. bit shocked 30-something PA coworker told us already got shot. said one pharmacy waitlist people. pessimists saying would least 1.5 million deaths covid US point nope, wrong. interesting turn events. I'd like know reasoning behind change directive was, numbers still seem support blood clotting serious issue. I've quite dismissive criticism vaccine now, NACI mess around recommendations. One high school classmate's kids got COVID, one still gotten sense taste back. idea might permanent horrifying, sort thing gets looked past lot since death. I'm sure bringing stuff said US banned exports EU exporting tens millions doses, also ability put stop it, want to. called misreprensentation. talk stuff probably false first stuff said can't admit wrong.

Talk youself whatever want spread misinformation. also think EU mishandled lot stuff change said. It‚Äôs simple psychology

What think brain dead anti vaccination anti-maskers going see maskless vaccinated people living best lives? matter argument.

Banning would mechanism getting rid cars. Stopping virus spreading would mechanism getting rid covid.

""Getting rid of"" works common term. do, especially individual pre existing condition prior experience precludes getting vaccine. 

Anybody get free covid shot now, Pfizer wanting hike price booster shots, I‚Äôll hold breath. access vaccines depends area live in, we‚Äôve learned vaccine distribution uptake uniform across low higher income communities. Also yeah don‚Äôt think undocumented individuals would like IBM state government knowing ‚Äúcheck in‚Äù daily basis, information could potentially subpoenaed. gave entire year life extremely selfish society went partied entire...fucking..year watch complete isolation. Fucking done. second shot later month. 2 weeks that, i'm absolutely 100% done isolation. What's surprising think exclusively American thing. Drama constantly going world, really depends media chooses cover. moment announce that, create incentive lie, that's big issue.

I would guess they've set internal threshold start message based many vaccinated. officially invest sector.

But imagine little bit EU. scope damage likely fully manifest decades. understand devastation Civil Iraq Wars ongoing oppression Johnson's anti-Reconstruction efforts making people hesitant jump extremes, convinced point Trump worst damaging President United States ever had. dude üëçüèø Low dose aspirin like cure everything. fill finish contract main production plant Novavax UK. Originally contract going go plant Germany seems like UK government made moves keep vaccine UK. middle schoolers trials might finished time back school. kids 12 Q4 earliest potentially Q1 2022. I‚Äôd like think people get turn fine, skeptical people get it. That's stance, too, making reasonable decisions. difficult time people I've known gotten planes vacations; alternatives (driving Airbnb) offer lot risk management, black white defense ""you went store shop, necessary?"" ""you die car accident, hurt somebody else, stop driving?"" gym year really miss it, fully vaccinated means unlikely I'll compound problem (still wearing mask time being), I'm fine getting back it. mean, like want get Hawaii, too, people. explain layman 90% infection reduction also translates 90% transmission reduction? sounds really good non-scientist can't figure make leap. simply know stops infection 90% time (with without symptoms), infer 90% virus pass on? particular point interest family I'd like able explain everyone working understanding. TIA! feels right you.

If value friendship far miniscule risk at. agree should. distributed better many cities there's still lots 65+ conditions able get one shot yet. I'm mistaken, expect trials children go quicker. focus efficacy much safety ensuring immune response. might slower large differences adults respond vs 6-month old responds. 'fill finish' previously going done Germany.

Given EU's recent actions suprise UK government acted involve GSK.

Novavax one 4 vaccines manufactured UK due support British Government. Opening everyone make harder. Yea, that‚Äôs exactly saying Event adge holders usually 4x3. ID holder. see people wear lanyard conferences. exact thing selling covid protector took lanyard made expensive. lives would saved government would little optimistic opinion. Biden says hopes small outdoor barbecue 3 whole months now, lot people hear never ending. think I've seen movie before? sub went super pessimistic last year treating wanting stay home till 2022 complete disregard human life, downvoting bad news oblivion labeling doom porn. 

The reality probably somewhere middle, there‚Äôs probably 8-12 weeks there‚Äôs significant risk another wave left. done different part pandemic different variants spreading capturing asymptomatic infections. really thorough look effectiveness real world conditions. mean vetted FDA. 

The experts agree: vaccine safe effective. Magnets stick stainless must‚Äôve something else going there. likely stainless really thin veneer actually plastic exterior. would explain insufficient magnetism. received call morning schedule shot! Friday. didn‚Äôt expect since PA still 1A. So, work coming through. üôå honest respect perseverance, even cause prolonging deadly pandemic Well I‚Äôve mine imma see friends You‚Äôre close fully protected. I‚Äôd personally wait out. Lol smoking. Trumps charge 10 12 months.

Hard believe you‚Äôre fucking us   Holy shit. kids going laugh faces ask 2020 say ""Murder Hornets."" No, son, I'm really kidding.

It really surprise ""Murder Hornets"" replaces ""jumping shark."" Sorry, Fonz. able develop tactics social-media companies happy key players anti-vaxx industry use services recruit new followers spread lies ever before. result, online infrastructure anti-vaccine websites, Facebook groups, YouTube channels, Instagram pages Twitter accounts combined audience 59 million won‚Äôt regardless lmao, paper mask isn‚Äôt gonna change It‚Äôs shameful it‚Äôs patronizing. real time contradiction contradiction. Let get straight here: think there‚Äôs subset Americans going pass getting vaccine spite people called selfish? instead pointing obviously selfish stupid is, need coddle feelings instead? Also CDC officially stating vaccine efficacy 80% 2 weeks Moderna Pfizer 1st shots, 2 weeks nearing 100m people significant immunity. already given new guidelines unvaccinated people.

And someone won‚Äôt get vaccine they‚Äôre shocked pandemic isn‚Äôt instant get shot, they‚Äôd use anything justify getting vaccine. dude obviously joking. lol wow. Canada already similar deal local production Novavax vaccine? GSK already factory Canada could converted? got #2 dose around 0830 Friday, fine 0200 (Sat) night, &amp; fatigue, sweats, shivers, body aches following day (a Sunday) around 1600.....so maybe like 40 hours total side effects. back normal. 

My arm hurt much worse injection site shot #1 vs shot #2, although shot #2 sore armpit back neck. Yes, brainless 16+ 18+? Surely can't serious? Yeah *the math* talking -- you. certainly scientists like Fauci says time get reckless.

You right though, future tell, Fauci says may take till 2022 get pandemic ""over"". People downvoted asking question point, vaccines becoming available, I'm really sure people sub worried about... infected COVID basement dwelling longer seen heroic. disagree kind rhetoric ‚Äúmakes‚Äù
People act irresponsibly still hysterical particularly productive. 

Health officials would probably better served transparently showing believe people stupid grasp nuanced rational messaging.  evidence proving stated speculation beliefs (which could correct, problem that)?

What stating COVID issue, nope, 65+ Europe issues causing deaths sub 40yo Africa covid affect Africa way various reasons.

Why trying say anything different? BBC ran story ""How worried walking outside"" Northern California relatively little covid Southern California already highly contagious strain run None Scotland 3 days saying ""every American"" - well, know vaccine even approved 18. Hopefully soon, unclear.

By ""every American"" mean 16+ that's what's currently approved, realistically 12+ results forthcoming assuming positive, existing widely available vaccine, risk point, virus simply dangerous 40. 

Over 30% COVID hospitalizations last year 50 years age. Nearly 60% 65! can't say dangerous. Right surge hospitalizations Michigan especially 20-50 year olds. I'm going travel go gym leave house every year flu season risk might possibly, maybe cause 25 year old catch flu die - I'm going COVID.

We vaccines widely available flu, around decades, understand it, treatments. casualties unfortunately deemed acceptable we've made every effort possible mitigate it. vaccines treatments mortality pretty low. COVID we're far there. vaccines distributed right now. everyone chance it, sure, time relax restrictions. 65 - get it. COVID really, really bad. they've able get shots point. I'm putting life hold 22 year olds can't math understand basic risk analysis.

Not everyone 65 received vaccine, get real, there's still many waiting. mother 75 able get first shot day ago.

You can't take couple isolated incidents, within state middle pack best distributing vaccines, extrapolate entire country. Exactly. thought recently.

I literally told today using 7 14 day averages looking hospitalization numbers ""spinning"" numbers pessimistically chart matters daily case count going back March 2020.

Try telling NYC me. fact, people NYC fucking stick telling do, shouldnt even try tell people do. Virginia here. Lol what? best way beat variants vaccinating quickly something absolutely excelled at. nonsense brand Amazon wearing since April. Rite Aid nearby sell packs 2 $3.99.  think need get people panicked possible previous administration handled Covid, show they‚Äôre ‚Äúfollowing science‚Äù.  fashionably late party. !remindme 6 weeks  chance. truth is, we'd would last decade people get complacent it'd shipped somewhere else it'd cheaper due competition juggernaut next door. 33 million doses allocated sites week, per White House. Insane. choice take vaccine higher efficacy. nice get choice! Moderna way! Well someone 55 vaccinated AstraZeneca I'm ready give whole charade. seriously deny second shot? think punishing individuals, worse yet punishing *everyone* handful people want get vaccinated good public policy. think call urgency.

I believe afraid herself. almost certainly fully vaccinated without question access best gear &amp; facilities.

I think message fence getting vaccinated, trying persuade get vaccine. would‚Äôve cheaper New Zealand strategy. idiots.  Virginia - suck. thing stopping vaccinated people going full 2019 lot public places open. then, vaccinated people live like 2019 home outdoor spaces. Seems like fair trade me! Absolute failure leadership.

She immediately fired that. Unfortunately, boss said agrees her.

She's also position NEEDS cases skyrocket maintain credibility longer-term. Yeah understand variant risk think would possible vaccines deaths explode again. right p1 interesting saw happened Brazilian town thet thought herd immunity Look I'd happy take win say totally obvious think I'd lying point. actual *clear* evidence, papers prove started. thing medical professionals insight vaccine *should* help based coronaviruses Astrazeneca 3 month period. 3 month period provide clear, obvious unavoidable translation political policy prioritise first vaccines. Plus applied wholly also untested Pfizer/BionTech.



Realistically also *gamble* policy based *clear* evidence understanding. Except saying year...

At end ""little longer"", goal posts move again. sCIEnCe iSn‚Äôt rEaL

Some people idiots perpetuate lies misinformation. sub rails anymore jesus. fucking CDC director saying worried god forbid brief thought wearing mask keeping distance enters brains moment us rational discussion. way, it‚Äôs actually shorting US‚Äôs need AZ vaccines. likely time AZ approved US Canada position export vaccines, US probably neither want need probably direct Canada send elsewhere, allowing Canada profit (in global prestige) AZ‚Äôs failure used US. Holy shit one dose strong?? Looks like wait longer J&amp;J data. I'm mildly concerned relative mRNA ones. New York Times? analysis media said media biased? 

Sure, believe that. making excuse tiny segment population, little large percentage anti maskers misinformed, selfish, scared. I've dealing headache sore throat past 3 days allergy season. wonder BoJo longer fan Cummings... absurd amount spending contract develop centralized app via tory cronies company despite everyone wanting decentralized implementation Google apple worked together offering.

And realised devices limitations using Bluetooth radio made homemade app ridiculously ineffective, one overcome using tech companies offered decentralized sdk.

Test trace, longest time, absolute fucking travesty wasted money.

So bad fact resulted downing street giving responsibility vaccine rollout Matt Hancock, fuckwitted invertebrate, corruption ineptitude.

There's going case brought government high court regarding hancock's refusal disclose records relating majority contracts handed out, case appears contracts offered privately ignoring suitable public sector candidates.

This directly impacted ppe procurement test trace significantly.

So yeah nah, much doubt argument there. Different methods testing different virus variants, etc. make really possible realistically compare vaccines moment. take whatever get first. I've vaccinated AstraZeneca six weeks ago get second dose two weeks. news making anxious give second dose able see family year. There's clear ethical issue even thinking denying second dose. makes incredibly mad never consider big societal picture. 

None available data suggests second jab would issue come say it? adults= 18 up. they're saying 90% places US eligible. 

and obviously also includes 16+ age, easier focus ""adults"" saying 16+. 

The 90% figure simply 5 areas. sorry rude though?

You know beer outside friends now, right? 

I get it, lockdown blows, one right mind would consider pub access issue ‚Äúcivil liberties‚Äù. Pubs entertainment venues. Completely optional. necessary human survival. think differently, I‚Äôm sorry rude, might want sort priorities.

It seems like cases go vaccinations go up, see ridiculous statements almost intentionally designed stomp confidence people pandemic ending. like idea taking something that's tested.

By comparison, among 994 people vaccinated, 161 developed infections.

Gee Wiz relaxing requirements would lead Certainly going argue that. (although also think bit complex too). watched 60 Minutes piece origin Covid19 last night, prepared really bad journalism - thought really good job it. Although could done longer piece hit high points. Basically China prevented/is preventing unbiased investigation we're supposed believe them, believe researcher closely tied lab. 

I'd encourage anyone missed discussion sub Saturday read info. I've following pretty closely learned something new there, US State Dept cable August 2019 concerned several researchers WIV got sick fall 2019 coronavirus-like symptoms. (google U.S. Embassy Fact Sheet: Activity Wuhan Institute Virology) 

Saturday's thread: Several reasons lot:

* countries expanded number beds (but far less number personnel). 15% remaining beds mean equal remaining capacity. likely usual occupation workload pre-covid

* every region density beds, last % usually need it.

* non-covid situation get ICU occupied mix long short term patients. Many staying 1-2 days operation, bed clears. patients covid, stay usually much longer. old people vaccinated variants hit seems average age shifting down, also means longer stays (because old frail people die faster). means speed healthcare resources free enact measures likely far slower second wave.

* point time, expect incoming demand proportional new cases two weeks later. cases increasing today, 15% partly gone already. wait hit 0% guaranteed run out.

So, no, think 15% lot. Austria sounded alarms 40% ""free"" beds last wave, things borderline control. know it‚Äôs annoying, she‚Äôll fine. understand there‚Äôs quite leeway still effective. March 2021, government restrictions &amp; people following regulations two different things. I'm expert, can't sure govt three six months' time. know a) we're much soon lift restrictions; b) likely 'roadmap' slow NHS comes additional strain opening early, may also slow us overall return normalcy generate another variant, c) basically happened wrt variants cropped far, seems like reasonable future course action variants may arise. 

I'm sure 'other options' referring to, though can't comment comparative efficacy. Brazil use periods separate millions, thousands hundreds. also completely disregarding fact chance (small not) virus keeps mutating evades vaccines thus continuing longer. No. Covid pose much threat people. idea closing things wearing masks avoid overwhelming hospitals. Regardless whether would happened otherwise, haven‚Äôt overwhelmed weeks extremely unlikely overwhelmed. people obligation worry Covid except giving someone vulnerable know. advantages this? literally piece cardboard honestly. job. good day Swimmin it. Yup, got vaccinated soon offered back December, hospital work Pfizer vaccines employees time.

Side effects seem vary widely, personally, felt tired lethargic day half dose. Kinda like I'd late partying night before. Symptoms start like 6 hours getting shot. wish simple. Small businesses got ruined schools willing open. Cannot really control that. Yes still pay full property tax. J&amp;J delivering small percentage vaccines US. US Government ordered 200 million J&amp;J vaccines total, already donating bunch Canada Mexico. 

For example New Jersey gets 500000 doses per week, 50000 J&amp;J Media going milk COVID clicks long possible. Cases going restrictions lifted young people vaccinated yet. fine. politics, money greed know one cares safety citizens. experience me. Went big vaccination site way Mill Basin / Marine Park area, first appointments around 8:30, 9:30/10:00 nobody line left place.

Feels like waste. staff terrific though system pat, moving people quickly. literal insanity. sub gone absolute crap. Giving dear old friends north makes sense, given border Canada still closed. classic Johnson \&amp;amp; Johnson Point still same. We're couple months 16+, possibly 12+ vaccinated, saving lives keeping people getting severely ill.

I want kids go back school need get back work, point, I'm willing wait vaccine available everyone contributing cesspool COVID spread. people tired bored, equate personally done pandemic actually over. Pure selfishness ignorance. I‚Äôm tired too, we‚Äôre fucking tired, say ‚ÄúCovid done‚Äù tens thousands cases thousand deaths death moronic. Yeah, no. Got mine yesterday. Didn‚Äôt even feel needle, side effects. Shopped around CVS little went home vaccinated snacks. got first shot weekend arm sore flu shot...I think shot #2 might rough me! hurrr durrr america bad Frane, day 1 nonetheless recommended cluster up, even open.

Didn't stop people choosing hear believe whatever fancied. that. Hey, least you‚Äôre honest want lockdowns restrictions continue, kudos Virginia, mom got appointment way health conditions. dad yet. Pretty impressive. read days ago someone suggested Moderna hit goal. many doses Pfizer delivered US? Getting first pfizer dose today anxious it. anyone else already theirs? go? knowledgeable scientists support conclusion. included deaths well,

Most world really bad tracks deaths too. Mexico majorly revise Covid deaths. Africa couldn‚Äôt even tell many die given year, I‚Äôm sure anyone expects Covid data useful. 

Poor rural nations don‚Äôt track deaths anywhere near accurately US EU.  Hindsight 20/20. vaccine studies specific time periods doses, information effective single is. 

Imagine single dose wasn‚Äôt effective wasted 4 months worth vaccines. 

There lot risk here, introducing new variables doesn‚Äôt always pay off. glad UK. Doesnt bucks come buck skins?

Lethality prime issue. quit even using word 'science' I've debated virus friends, family, colleagues. changed everything concepts math framed things percentages ... i.e 'what masks help X%, washing hands helps X%, staying home helps X%, staying 6 feet away helps X% really increased odds'. seemed resonate people said 'science' people turn brain. many people wanted things absolutes got thinking lots small improvements adding better chance could rethink that. hoping ChadVax. casually, since IP UK, UKIP-Vaccine.

Yeah, try getting mugged, vehicle stolen etc see useful cameras are.... Reality always so-so US news publication paints lol. 

It's network cameras start. cameras certainly equal. think see shit 80/90's one lol? Guess again. think anyone even watching VAST majority them, point, let alone live? Guess again. understand implications sure. Ah yes, blame people ""keeping going"" instead government implemented policy. government's policy requires 100% compliance, really dumb policy, *especially* United States.

Would make sense government take account behavior characteristics population trying make reasonable policy? Presumably not, we're still year later blaming people wanting keep businesses open wanting social interactions.

Anything short martial law military enforcement lockdown ever going eradicate Covid United States, bullshit quasi-lockdowns done absolutely nothing stop also destroying millions people's livelihoods. never ""if shut bars couple months, Covid goes away,"" really know millions people around country tricked that. We're giving 2.5M vaccinations per day cases deaths decline. selfish want live lives year living awful restrictions? vector vaccines. coronavirus vaccines neutralize variants. That's reassurance Lol test trace app one best world?! think government going tell private landlords they‚Äôre allowed evict clients aren‚Äôt paying rent? understand would absolutely destroy privately owned apartments right? That‚Äôs basically saying renting controlled government. That‚Äôs absurd. No, no, we're allowed discuss death toll allow think problems COVID wore n95 kn95 2 weeks second dose. that, OTC surgical much careless it, like holding breath around maskless crowds chatting, avoiding people smoking, etc. Though things still make nervous due mindset year straight. FWIW friends COVID history Florida told wait 70 days COVID. Honestly get sense anyone fully recovered (10 days positive plus 0 symptoms) going get vaccine completely fine. suspect lockdown vaccines moment. 

Here Ireland we're vaccination trajectory rest EU never loosened restrictions Christmas cases deaths still low broadly similar UK Yes. Ccp never unveil truth endemic virus spread across globe. possibility scary variant going exist forever. 

Vaccinate people fast possible. That‚Äôs it. Vaccines end game. nothing past ‚Äúa vaccine‚Äù. UK Africa variant problem, Brazil variant tho, yes that‚Äôs statistics work. doesn‚Äôt matter share population. share virus matters. AstraZeneca already epic click-bate, guess answer. Yes, clear, say ""state"" mean federal government case. CDC track covid vaccinations individual level, state (Michigan) automatically believe case Michigan residents-- never opted system assume happens automatically us. Glad it, too, nice know they're tracking ever switch doctors records get lost.

Another commenter said that's case Texas looks like varies state state. immunity natural infection provides also cuts transmission re-infected? delayed tried pinch pennies


They didn't.

All companies like biontec, Modena etc able deliver. first set numbers threw out, already met. cited second set numbers (I think 20K day). 

""To save lives"" goal. generalized mission statement. goal ""offer vaccines every person age 65+ certain high risk groups every one wants one get one"" ""keep hospitalizations higher demand ICU beds supply."" ""to save lives"" goal, never reach it, even 100% people get vaccinated (impossible, course), someone die COVID. Assuming get 75% (unrealistic conceivable) adults vaccinated, still risks. People can't plan businesses plan lives ""we'll tell we've saved enough lives meet 'goal'"". 

As suggestion CDC *has* lie people people childish accept reality, guarantee public go along moving goals they're lied first time; least admitted goalposts moving, progress, lied two posts ago. feel good come clean?

Look, insult want. makes look foolish. I've stayed home year. I'm epithets hurled me. understand frustrations people want get lives face vague vacillating goals benchmarks.

The refusal wear mask, intentional absence one, entirely political entirely virtue signalling. ""Look me, fall [insert evil government conspiracy varying levels absurdity]."" someone wearing mask indicates nothing person, loudly and/or violently refused show us big fucking problem, cannot trust people sense word. Nothing wrong keeping records, course! Yeah, definitely recommend relying doctor's office records. I've run issues doctors literally tossing entire record (just discovered trying get proof past vaccine) I'm glad Michigan least tracks vaccinations automatically. I've heard states opt-in, might worth looking that's case Texas another copy records beyond have. Sure jan Emails aren‚Äôt going get anything done. people want protest endless dragging restrictions, they‚Äôre going person. Signed purchasing agreement AZ day prior UK, put Europe first clauses funding (of BioNtech). completely shit bed delivery EU. COVID last leg, good done. 1000 deaths per day *and declining*. We're giving 2.5M vaccinations per day. Unless virus suddenly mutates completely evade immunity becomes way deadlier young people, stand statement.

It's ""selfish"" want live life year shit. see light end tunnel, ""selfish"" acknowledge that. I‚Äôd like travel exemption curfew laminated too. would guessed document would ever exist lifetime? Hospitals filling Michigan. covid patients. numbers going down. death rate think highly expensive cities see reduction recalibration office space likely total elimination. less expensive cities see typical return normal suspect. school ""freshman plague"" yearly phenomenon September; hell, one year surprisingly large outbreak HFM disease dorms. Maybe sick people wearing masks would help blunt similar outbreaks future. I've said before, whole entire world went panic attack sought method reassure away anxiety, whether belief system act (hoarding tp), saw planet deal crisis end revealed people respond reaction. Surveillance cameras tracing via mobiles internet China does. Quite right, sir! 

There 'pissing away' Boris. He's good making money vanish, public money that, little questioning (Thames Garden Bridge jumps mind). get think ""task failed successfully"". world enough capacity produce enough vaccines short time frame.

If think small-ish countries fully vaccinated rest world suffers breeds new covid variants preferable everyone getting fair share problem. country ""won"" race vaccination numbers mean covid them. everyone vaccine. world wide. Third wave? Swede, even aware second wave ever ending. messaging US really needs hard shift pro-mask, pro-social distancing stance pro-vaccine one.

I friends pro-mask pro-social distancing, dragging feet comes getting vaccine. live Texas, everyone eligible, see availability CVS 30 mins told about. young healthy, feel like get sense let high-risk people get mask meantime?

Leaders need stop talking social distancing masking up. already get importance it, need hammer importance vaccinations order protect people. know voted. Long covid real children adults dramatically affects people. young family member still can't go back work 4 months. second point valid too. look Chile.  HQ Manhattan, hybrid environment well. important note everyone loves remote work **all** time. think many unused vaccines meaning suggesting. They're horded, hidden rainy day. least country.

In state considerable number ""unused"" doses actually administered, reported late. California established typically bureaucratic paperwork-heavy reporting system people procrastinating workload. cases, refusing obnoxious paperwork.

Also states define ""unused"" differently makes look better. identify two shots used even though first administered. they're holding second specific person specific appointment consider dose ""used"".

In cases ""problem"" unused vaccines misunderstanding process. may exceptions. past weekend, mayor Toronto saying around 30,000 open vaccination appointments week 70+ crowd going unfulfilled, Toronto. Completely agree. think US could like countries eliminated COVID blind reality (and willing assert things evidence support).

Our culture allow it. laws allow it. Maybe that's bad thing, maybe not. every country going handle every crisis equally well. 

What US could done focused instead infrastructure solutions took burden individuals. good this. vaccine distribution fantastic example US best.

We hub biomedical innovation, that's coincidence. major power enough geopolitical influence secure tons vaccines, especially US-based countries. could applied strategy testing. didn't.

People say, ""Trump allow it,"" maybe right, allowed social distancing. came around masks. pain ass actions constitute mass manslaughter neglect, anyone really, seriously suggested moonshot testing showed effective could be, maybe could setup true mass testing regime. worked extremely well universities. would work even better scale. everyone easy access vaccines, anyone justify acceptable open up? readily available everyone chance get vaccine, sure, open up. person gets severely sick dies COVID point purely due lack caring opening way soon. We're like 2-3 months tops there. know people justify OK vaccines close readily available everyone.

In US, still tens millions vulnerable people unvaccinated, choice. virus changed, still spread, people protection need.

Look Michigan, hospitals filling up. People 20-50 getting sick death rate starting increase well.

Once vaccine fully available sure cases hospitalizations still exist minimal. we're yet. Treatments also developed. Covid better spreading airborne. tie t-shirt around face prevent droplet spread basically last year. work airborne viruses make n95's. also stop testing flu.

Bullshit they're tracking tracing effectively say percentage came where. case, they'd wiped virus now. I'd say that's largely guesswork I'm pal, friend. happening.

I'm looking forward many people getting vaccinated possible well! Fingers crossed! Stay safe! timeline makes sense me.

Get N95 go wherever want, need lock indoors hard piece shit? seems right, yes. Sweden expecting 4M doses/month July onwards, additional 2M doses would enough full vaccination adults.

The keyword earlier estimate *adults*. mean would enough doses inhabitants.

Also, think specific wording Swedish along lines ""all adults *want* vaccine"", means refusing vaccine could also excluded target. giving 1 dose already disease would also make bit easier reach. Why... Get N95 freely walk around. need isolate extent Paid received orders Pfizer mean. Indeed are. clarify,, would rather prevent hospitalisations people survive saving people would die?

Well, Kids still tested holidays, daughter given tests bring take home. immunity begin with, body serious reaction. second shot necessary UK national lockdown since start January too

England has.

Wales lockdown even longer, past week started lighten restrictions; barbers/hairdressers opened supermarkets sell non essential goods (like clothing, electronics, media, etc.) Actually insightful got severe reaction shot exactly 1 year getting covid. means antibodies natural covid infection lasted 1 year, would protection covid anyway without vaccination again. likely antibodies covid last well year cases natural covid infections mean, protects vaccinated person only.

I've needed produce mine 15 years, even changed jobs past bullets go home kill social circle exponents close country world sacrifice second summer season pitentj revenue. pandemic stretched beyond many people businesses handle afraid matter anymore hence quarantine rules kept place much longer even implemented. mean high variance... worries seem completely forgotten Measles mumps small pox. things drastically changed bodies people caught them.

Brain damage.

All things diseases kill everyone, definitely altered got them. Even healthy people brought knees.

Meanwhile, 3 months 3rd UK lockdown, 8 last 12 months UK's version lockdown (no fun allowed. work).

I'll fully vaccinated soon one close friends got infected. Hospitations deaths two different things.... truly one person squarely blame, Trump. press conferences pushed lies, expect administration didn‚Äôt believe science? another contradiction/mistake business owners pushing reopening (in places compensation). government forces close get compensated, moment reopen (too early, therefore low demand) loses yours. believe all.

UK millions people larger 2 months delay, Canada several hundred thousands within 2-3 weeks. ordinary passport necessary cross borders. we‚Äôre talking ‚Äúpassport‚Äù somewhere people congregating. 

Anyway, somewhere 40% 60% Americans never traveled internationally, based quick Googling. UK currently process ending lockdown deaths hospitalizations going down. Cruises employ tons people without many small countries who's gdp significantly affected cruises absolutely devastated financially. Lots tourist companies rely cruises devastated too. financial impacts enormous. comes mental health impacts well too.

If open su,mer really 2 full years cruise seasons they'll shut down. Two years way much.

I see can't reopen 100% occupancy long everyone board required vaccinated barring children. Masks inside still mandatory. also fake COVID vaccines available dark web. I'm sure, person may gotten fake vaccine? got real vaccine, seem worked. One important thing know many days past vaccination antibody test done? days past vaccination, might see much antibody response yet. almost died pneumonia five. definitely getting vaccine know, income illegal (selling alcohol) such, taxable. illegal incomes became taxable point. know exactly suspect around time.

You see surviving crime. free so. know companies hire remote long time employees allowed to. Lol downtown Detroit fine. last 20 years? Nice city... we've dozens big cities zero deaths per day scale Germany.

You're going 3rd wave we're not, EU heads still debating fucking vaccine use. People dying sheer incompetence. hybrid let companies use less floor space? Agreed. I‚Äôm curious ‚Äî okay (and okay mean agree don‚Äôt need shutdown) certain number flu deaths per year, won‚Äôt satisfied Covid deaths effectively zero? use CVS website check availabilities, never see appointments available Massachusetts period. always also check New York, I've never seen CVS Bronx booked example. back New York I'd vaccine that, what's frustrating  wonderful news!! UK strategy prioritizing getting first doses many people possible (rather fully vaccinating smaller numbers) huge success lowering infection rates, since first dose already quite effective.

Labour course still find way say good enough, organize small bar mitzvah lives depended it. soon racist enough Labour? definitely true countries. American airlines members IATA?

Every airline advanced country would IATA member. Give Liberty Give death. Yep. That's America. laughing China's harsh lock down. willing 600,000 people's death prove believe Democracy.

Imagine ICU occupied means crucial personel... even stupidly badly broken leg (arm) skateboard fall could lifethreathning situation, cause free personel (for example anesthesiologist) emergency operation available moment... Come now. many people gotten seriously sick receiving one vaccines? Like hundred entire world maybe? That‚Äôs even remotely statistically significant amount reasonable person worry about. I'm super glad hear that. means hope covid free near future. mean will, every American sufficient time vaccinated. pleasantly surprised see many residential Floridians wearing masks, businesses taking seriously still work. 

It‚Äôs sad mentioned rising numbers last week swamped downvoted people flooded right-wing conspiracy subs, ‚Äòopen up‚Äô cult. many still dying every day many want pretend it‚Äôs dad lung cancer multiple high risk illnesses. worth family. would nice keep low. virus gone anywhere, lots people unvaccinated still - rate vaccination slow month too. Meanwhile europe getting hit hard third wave, could still experience degree careful. Seems like kinda quarantine project They're really. 

That said, want last lockdown. Definitively. going slow cautious way that, I'll wait. Mexico, definitely strings attached. sure Canada. Technically Canada supposed give us vaccines back time fully vaccinated won‚Äôt need them, give away someone else. really give Canada free. We‚Äôve seen local bump cases 18-39 group (this Illinois) they‚Äôre pushing ‚Äúthis serious young people, too!‚Äù narrative, anyone look right Illinois Department Public Health web site see that, no, it‚Äôs vastly likely won‚Äôt be. Sure, *can* serious. car accident things normal day life carry tiny risk. 

It‚Äôs year. social end pandemic looks like. they‚Äôre continuing push fear getting eye-rolls, eroding credibility anything else. (Remember, health officials people think always cook meat medium-well ‚Äúsafety‚Äù.) states increasing (MI, NJ, NY) Democratic governors. Meanwhile Texas' case counts continue drop. There's something else happening that's complicated ""Republicans bad."" Give Canada. might well open everyone point, GTFO boomers. fact covid can‚Äôt infect bats bit suspicious. Pity took 127k people due several unenforced lockdowns corporate bullshit guess reading latest Statewide data earlier week indicated hospital bed occupancy **COVID-19 patients** 72%. Thirteen hospitals **90% bed occupancy COVID-19 patients**, according data. half people care.

No cost high stop covid them. ""Oh unemployed homeless? Well least covid, immediately agreeing need decade, dirty anti-masker!"" Yeah, be? I'm happy little bird painted Mr. Ross Australian know always uncomfortable people say becoming like USA. pandemic shown differently treat life, reality fellow citizens.

Yes, brutal Portugal, government locked fully, people complied. summer numbers - vaccination slow though! imo significantly greater downwards curve matching trends last year. Right curve flat lined. know better, release things vaccine demand outpaces vaccine supply? Yeah, people run shit aren‚Äôt going let bargaining chip valuable go waste. Nope, won‚Äôt export vaccine finished. also kind needed vaccines though,since great lockdown. Drive across border Ohio. Toledo area TONS appointment slots open. optimal ICU occupancy US 75%, balances profit care quality best. Obviously profit consideration Europe, probably swap pit profit efficiency mean less thing. 

Low occupancy means better care patients, high occupancy means staff thus also better care. worst place medium occupancy, get crowding without extra staff, care Tell 95+ kids families Michigan developed misc-c. Tell people long covid. people like me, took months recover prior lung function. almost year immune system absolute trash now. strong reactions tdap flu shot. Every cold get knocks ass now.

Hope companies same. 

220 million vaccines sounds impressive, less 15% population Africa. Russian patriots living USA mask isn‚Äôt problem doesn‚Äôt bother me. forget time. I‚Äôm masks. 


It makes feel like progress that‚Äôs made vaccines doesn‚Äôt matter. vaccinated doesn‚Äôt matter. 
Originally goal flatten curve. Never eliminate 100%. I‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs flu people die flu year weren‚Äôt using covid measures try avoid flu deaths before. 

So get point deaths minimal spread low due vaccines can‚Äôt things go back normal? 

If could guarantee 100% mask wearing vaccinated get rid I‚Äôd wear masks another year more. Perhaps keeping down, believe time wave 'crushed' (mid Jan) vaccination still quite low. provide alternate take here, states opening (or already opened up) vaccines ages likely getting used older population. Ohio ripped last levels suspect lot people refusing get vaccine. states still holding might older populations getting vaccinated, course good thing. CVS went mine line wrapped cookie aisle, suspiciously sale. people got free juice, bought cookies. I? Nope, talking strategy. good news think % people think like this? much US.

I think media-coverage USA accurate. place live,.. wfh, isolation mask wearing pretty predominant. (so much so,. could walk middle highway usually packed day near 0 cars). 

Like many aspects human society,. bad parts trolls complainers (and rule-violates) get media coverage. examples absolutely represent accurate picture actually happened. far, sounds like people wishing true rather actually true.

I think wishing true, highly likely point. 

Especially everybody access serious moral implications health passports, covid continues bubble beneath surface everyone wants vaccine one absolutely expect countries maybe even large events require vaccination. mixed feelings terms ""wanting"" think inevitable alternative periodic outbreaks take dozen cases fizzle out. lockdowns still justified death rate low? Hoping stopping global spread want Nah card meaningless sad see making mistakes UK first vs UK variant, despite setting pretty strong example badly get fucked take seriously.  
 
At least vulnerable vaccinated, guess, slightly better situation in, see hospitals still overwhelmed many places.  First travel it‚Äôs one thing. entry businesses shit show segregate African American minority communities, vaccine hesitant result historically shit medical community kinda goes ways though.

I've people thought friends openly post online people work bar/liquor industry plague rats. ""just stay home, stupid stay home?"" people say people work industries need paycheck, people legitimately mentally struggling this. ""how dare kill grandparents"" someone decided needed get stuff Target.

Dude, talking about? saying never replied comment back forth someone OP. literally scroll see outright stopped replying comments. larger part conversation. got notification upvotes saw labeling everyone disagreed anti-maskers. 

I problem disengaging conversation, everything said far totally civil. literally conversing comment made, replied. That's harassment all. 

In fact, again, one name-calling calling people anti-maskers. slandering people. 

But right, report me. Makes sense. Curious, large cards outside NY. NY anyway, relatively large dont fit nicely wallet pocket sized. right, late night even see UK. Seems like lot people think reached end pandemic given trying social distance limit contacts. 

Hope dangerous thing pandemic ridden country like have. 60-70% number largely formed original strain mind. B117 likely require higher % think solid data yet. need open possibility 70% might cut now. second paragraph spot on. vaccine end game. nothing ‚Äúa vaccine‚Äù.

There *always* threat scary variant endemic virus. you‚Äôre going restrict life could ‚Äúvariant‚Äù someday, you‚Äôll forever. That‚Äôs never going away. sure helps , important documents get ( passport , vaccination card etc ) . always take photo send email. way lose , always pull email verify document . Iceland allowing fully vaccinated tourists come needing sort quarantine upon arrival. applaud efforts intentions scientists involved get smallest slivers evidence. 

Unfortunately, never know truth. CCP everything power make sure that. Given increased transmission B117 60-70% numbers herd immunity likely optimistic point. think anyone really knows, wait see, I'm expecting us need 80-85% minimum now. There's difference making adults wear mask making kids wear mask. super young kids, say preschool kindergarten level, keep taking off, what's punishment? even punish them, tell parents instead? so, parents anything it, even encourage kids take off? 

If they're older, punish like would infraction? keep it, would send online school many times getting caught? 

There's lot questions left unanswered. Except deaths hospitalizations increasing Michigan lot b.1.1.7. logic flawed. Less 20% pop vaccinated. Even seniors are, contagious/deadly variant like b.1.1.7 loosened restrictions expect brief surge point likely April. northeast already seeing it. Hopefully deaths stay low due elderly becoming immune. I‚Äôm early 20s made educated decision taking vaccine

Why suspect long term affects? rationalize purposefully taking larger risk getting Covid, definitely long lasting effects? Ya countries? scattered around them? sakes well... matter equivalent getting tetanus booster shot every many years? matter flu-level less event? Zero COVID needed ""over"". It'll cease public health emergency that's end goal. I‚Äôm getting vaccine today CVS! Super excited! Canada handling vaccination national level, provincial level? got alert kid school got covid school happen school spread. class kid went 2 week virtual learning safe nobody else got it. Masks measures taken (separation, hvac, staff vaccines, etc). guess measures working. know mean lol, many decades data anecdotes effects things. much vaccine. don‚Äôt really view comparable. ""Hope dangerous thing""? lol. ... statistics statistics statistics ... death worth ability eat Applebees. things shown greatly increase spread closed cases down. works. think it‚Äôs good respiratory virus. It‚Äôs karmic people became infected bad people inconsiderate citizens. It‚Äôs possible take every recommended precaution still get it, Vice versa. comment requiring vaccinations? carry alveolar PCR tests everyone tested Brittany find out? CAN'T SAID FIRST taking brand new drug

It's funny many people worried vaccine load body McDonalds damn near daily, drink alcohol like water pop pills like candy given doctors without much ways question. 

Like ok.. get someone hardcore dieter really watches put body can't tell concerned vaccine beat fuck liver two three times week suck five diet sodas day. Let‚Äôs see GOP politicians grand kids! Yeah Chichen Itza mask issues gets silly hot walking around ruins areas seeing similar rates among young people getting hospitalized before, kind counters theory variants reason younger people getting hospitalized. Even though young people getting hospitalized, consistent numbers original variant, increasing spread. know entirely depends live right? seen someone store without mask since like last May June. look excess deaths compared previous years. fall line COVID death count. hard figure out. Yeah, went passed prohibition constitutional amendment adding income tax. nail Capone. ""Good, hope Bidens evangelical nuts take it.""

Fixed you. Negligible go, girl! goal still protecting NHS. want go away real, gain actual traction it, need get population herd immunity case load zero near it, a) aren‚Äôt creating new variants in-house spread, b) new variant comes elsewhere, we‚Äôre quick ready booster plan we‚Äôre constantly playing catch-up original virus. Deaths excellent, number want watching cases. long cases high are, it‚Äôs safe open fully. still need vaccinate. can't say fuck it, especially anyone 16+, likely 12+ ease access vaccine summer. We're close. get 80% test say screw turn you? drive 80% way home park car side road walk rest way you? cook meal leave simmering stove 80% done. would finish this?

If vaccines pipe dream point, sure may make hard choices. literally cusp everyone vaccinated. death one death many, especially now, preventable. Sure Democrat governors made silly decisions sure hell can't deny majority states either never closed, half ass attempts lockdown jumped first chance open predominantly GOP run.. Florida, Texas, Louisiana, South Dakota, South Carolina. seems crazy close finish straight turn around start running backwards again.. Key word **arent** vaccinated Macron lost covid started. Honestly, miracle collapsed multiple times millions deaths mere months. Whoever's power. Does. Not. Matter. would even worse anyone else chances taking exponentially agaim quite bit less last year. vaccinated people people recovered immunity, there's less chances virus spread. Would interested know % share Hungary. Stupid americans Gotcha. don‚Äôt think comment originally said smoker. trying defend person called asshole. think familiar facts believe children safely playgrounds right hold opinion schools. Yeah guess so. really sure lol. show shots way back baby. never knew site existed now. general public. two shootings past week probably we‚Äôve already moved on. Sandy Hook back 2012 sadly broke terms hoping solution happens, even simplest background checks. nothing‚Äôs done even slightest kindergarteners gunned reason someone way older them, nothing eyes done. it‚Äôs based fear of, ‚ÄúThey gon take guns, brother!‚Äù already stated, cases matter. Hospitalisations deaths matter.

Yes cases tied trends hospitalisations deaths due first doe vaccines given almost 'vulnerable' people within two weeks see massive decrease deaths/hospitalisations per case. Vaccines (rarely) dangerous short term. aren‚Äôt many adverse effects shown late historically. Also noted using large number Russian Chinese vaccines. that's case even washing hands. GTFOH. Polio spread droplets dim bulb. you‚Äôre admitting wearing mask prolonging pandemic. That‚Äôs true. virus could trumps chance finally step leader, isn‚Äôt guy Well, fair thermal paper would faded anyways. Thermal paper bad choice something archival. sound callous want it, move younger age groups want semblance normalcy year? Intense! cares friends family say? Data data, gossip inner circle data. Okay, poor downvotes. idea long vaccination lasts, pretty much every vaccination booster time adult enough care longer dangerous. Covid variants change die, think covid new norm vaccination maybe lasts 3 years (random number!) 3 years everyone vac'ed works 90+% population going away, ever. countries care it; can't afford it, leaders plain stupid (looking Lair....)

There pandemic, I'm fatalistic person understand deadly not, life end covid-19 live it; organise planning end silly. 
 

I understand everyone vacc'ed tomorrow day 2 weeks staying inside could work but, c'mon possible. vaccines arrived Tel Aviv permission Israeli authorities, control imports exports well freedom movement within West Bank Gaza. 

Interesting, learned freedom movement high school class read Xhosa Black people South Africa. went U.N. New York, saw freedom movement Article 13 UDHR.

I‚Äôm glad humans living got vaccines I‚Äôm surprised learn imports exports controlled like that. much power people, you‚Äôd think Israeli government would kind obligation vaccinate them. Moderna 100%, J&amp;J fine effective. Moderna/Pfizer there's low enough chance getting pretend exist comment incredibly chilling...because it‚Äôs frighteningly true. You‚Äôll really close already highest immunity vaccine it‚Äôs outdoors - go celebrate! Already shamed people life (fortunately mostly nutty types) suggesting life resume everyone opportunity get vaccinated. Also drew line sand months ago saying I‚Äôd resume pre-COVID activities/fun max effectiveness kicked second dose. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è gave last year 20s cautious...with risk lower I‚Äôm give first year 30s anyone surprised cases going up? one expected decreasing things opening up. Plus variants.

We banking vaccine protecting vulnerable states goal beginning. You‚Äôve read much fear medial. little hope man. won‚Äôt last forever. beating covid worst thing? There's BETTER. Yeah, bad here. Put Le Pen M√©lenchon power death toll would 2-3M range insane violence hung vaccinated friends Friday. Anyone know risk so? appointment first vaccine Thursday sure  Oh ok. guess, lost card, access that... Go fun! And, happy birthday! number important one: Deaths 29%. Five comments story ""Republican governors bad; no, Democrat governors bad."" 

I even know expect learn threads anymore ... political war. yeah contra costa isn‚Äôt richmond, idt know you‚Äôre talking about. kensington, orinda, moraga, etc? guy right.

i live alameda county too. aside hills piedmont it‚Äôs affluent seem think. fuck cares though? they‚Äôre getting additional vaccine access that‚Äôs great. imagine gatekeeping qualifies nice bay area county lmfao That's fine, get it.

I'm staying home get though, let's get straight now. People literally die ICU capacity exceeded even locally. closing last percentage points capacity still available, extremely ill people moved crowded hospitals make room. risky. severe cases left without ICU leave room severe cases. Meaning suffer. ICU utilization something want optimize aggressively.

I'm sure US healthcare system efficient generating income shareholders. expensive, least efficient system patients though. figure CDC's job worry it, manage life. That's reason certain governors pushed reopen quickly. Yes, Whitmer, cuomo, Murphy. stalwart gop governors. one's going ask that. vaccinating 3+million per day, vs 60k new cases . win race without question. China part study list faith results longer independent. hope independent study day. state automatically entering online state immunization record website. vaccination sites responsible it. Hmmm might give force. punishment something. Idk what, maybe future thing, maybe something made up, that's important part. Never again. Bull. I'll take mt chances, Reddit immunologist. need breathe random people's breath healthy. look Covid-19 holder, they're already amazon, 6 bucks 2. think familiar facts feels weird finally getting something right Tories managed piss away 22B quid test trace system fit purpose, whereas Germany spent less 1B system actually works. Conan Barbarian wants laminations. change?

Because I'm seeing excuses start now...""we can't get back normal kids vaccinated"" Tick frontline worker box, let book without referencing GP group markers reliable old Donny Leadership matters. Anyone understanding logistics ‚Äúvaccine passports‚Äù vaccine tickets get venues? time gets rolled it‚Äôs gonna summer and...idk...maybe 
180million Americans vaccinated then.

How hell going backtrace that? many vaccine cards lost then? people‚Äôs vaccine status already going database? doses verified efficacy. Better give strong protection everybody give total protection half population leave half protection all. fair, I‚Äôve classroom since September 24 first graders class. It‚Äôs ‚Äúsafer‚Äù typical year poor kids classroom cohort kids day. eat lunch special activities like art, music even gym classroom. It‚Äôs ideal it‚Äôs worked stop spread around school. addition, first grade classroom set like HS classroom. table groups, small reading tables, class library. desks facing forward shields, 6 feet apart. classroom gigantic it‚Äôs meant house Kindergarteners typical school year (Kindergarten students get bigger classroom due center/play activities involved). Despite positives come type set up, lot negatives students. Kids need movement change scenery. think important thing school year fact kids person seeing one another. Remote learning children taught. amount regression saw year astronomical due kids remote March-June. district plans get rid remote learning next year can‚Äôt even imagine learning gap children coming back school. Regardless challenges pandemic brings, look forward helping/teaching kids love do. No, it‚Äôs better continue vaccine rollout open cases drip like rock June. nothing really concerned, join virtual events many places putting on! Donations help well! friend invited next weekend (Saturday) outdoor bar. got second Moderna shot lays Thursday. I‚Äôve heard wait 2 weeks fully immune. 
I turn 30 next weekend leaning towards going. haven‚Äôt done anything sticks really past year. irl we'll go back commute, work, commute grind spongebob meme person's livelihood silly thing? Thats tbh, Australian vaccine rollout rubbish international standards.

There lot things scream federal health department inefficiency, like relying doctors give shots obviously within capability nurse paramedic, following ordinary TGA approval process middle fucking global pandemic,, locking people cumbersome GP appointment system rather setting mass vaccination centres, etc etc etc.

Saying people dying well good, fact pre covid normal standards, every government would agreed current situation, borders closed 12 months, families separated, cross state travel incredibly risky international tourism education markets simply vaporized would outright economic emergency. answer extort middle class America taking brand new drug holding employment hostage? statist things, guess.

I‚Äôm really worried. us want vaccine. kind psychotic authoritarian suggestions turn lots neutral people away vaccine preventive measures. Yeah, Reddit anti-shut now, overall population even done restrictions. reality london barely lockdown. Well, shops, bars restaurants closed people moving freely otherwise. Hope dangerous. would‚Äôve better results without condescension don‚Äôt want it. But...thanks offer, guess? Latest data Hungary:

 - 7d average new cases: 920/million (USA highest: 757, UK highest: 881)
 - 7d average new deaths: 25.9/million (USA highest: 10.36, UK highest: 18.46)
 - Test positivity rate: 25.5% (USA highest: 14.7%, UK highest: 12.8%)
 - Vaccine doses administered: 24.8/100 people, EU: 14.6, USA: 39.8, UK: can't sustain much longer lot people sub getting that. article posted group today topic. Uh no, risk variants mitigated. Less spread equals less chance harmful variants emerging. I'm 35 additional risk factors received first dose vaccine end February. Second dose already booked middle May. London really cracking waiting lists. ever tried 2-hour way commute, close high paying job appealing. Hardly huge margin, thats way lower would expected! really think we're gonna get anywhere believe this.

I'm avid supporter promoting good lives life life's sake. human life that's garbage life worth living simply better dead. Theres difference second paragraph sad me, hope able find meaning life empty comfort.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* telling us ‚Äújust wait little longer‚Äù since whole two weeks stop spread. listen people anymore? Yeah, around 8 billion people left vaccinate, let's hope variant makes vaccination ineffective emerge next couple years going take vaccinate all.  way spread scenario. CDC Worldometer death counts different February 2021 (and track even different March : Shows well 56,000 deaths (moving average well 2,000 throughout : Shows 41,252 deaths (you filter first table monthly). Thought experiment. 

If used weigh 400 pounds, lost 200 pounds, subsequently gained 2 pounds?

How feeling overall prognosis get reaction got vaccine? prompted get test? means variants full play here.

I worries vaccines vs variants, there's difference variant identified region spreading widely. UK variant common still short majority US cases. Brazil South African variants less 1% cases, they're concerning UK variant terms antibody escape. likely one study exposed later two variants, least statistically meaningful degree. think definitely fair analysis, possible tested PCR positive even study like reduced ability transmit. 

What's great comes CDC itself. trying convey many friends (many scientists like me) data Isreal saying rigid going CDC saying. CDC sponsored study produce data like good (plus well done study). 

While think CDC changes recommendations, think writing wall masked risk low least may receive first shot year. live Poland I'm also late 20s I'm pretty sure receive vaccine year. always possibility, recorded rates outdoor transmission (especially masked) low. friends totally apolitical, really follow news all, wear masks they're required seem enjoy it, etc. asked getting vaccine they're mostly saying ""why, difference make? I've already Covid."" need find way reach people. tell nothing changes getting vaxxed, simply going many bought people really know getting into. Speculation /r/skiing going able get great deals barely-used backcountry ski gear next year! infection rates largely followed seasons. grounds believe cases increase lockdown ended today. good watch might explain 'efficacy' Hybrid short-run, think makes sense long run. disadvantages offices without advantages.

Companies go either fully WFH fully in-the-office (with majority going fully WFH). conclusively determined natural variation.. fit agenda people.  Yep. vaccine better form protecting thing, better form reducing spread. still mask heart's content long want even gotten vaccine. Since basically 5-6 week long process full efficacy reached, really think imperative people get first dose today get one. drag feet first dose, pushes long it'll take get second dose full efficacy. Also, sooner US 'done' vaccinating, sooner start helping countries. Gov Cuomo hid real number nursing home deaths. shit ton people still vaccinated US, including want vaccinated. Furthermore, vaccines instantaneous take time work, going decent period time unvaccinated recently vaccinated risk due higher rates spread. think India reported exported doses Covax. also country exported vaccines kept themselves. one dumbest things I've ever read. Moderna dumb ass  sub probably going downvote hell saying wear mask getting vaccinated. protect them, even people them, keep unvaccinated people following mandates. unvaccinated people chilling areas masks required, 50% people wearing them, way easier get away conveniently ""ignoring"" mandates.

Get comfortable cloth mask whatever wear **where required** longer required point vaccinated?

To decrease/get rid chance getting COVID, serious symptoms get decrease chances passing onto someone else. Also help country work towards point lift restrictions. clear, think restrictions masking last longer. think impending doom around corner. agree. think there's always fear ""nothing normal ever  again"", world society large experienced many equally (or more) enduring crippling crisis past. lot spanned years even entire generations people able move on, albeit changes societal standards. never added pandemic, sickness, etc one really make substantive lasting change beyond years. Yup. mentally telling we're really 50% mark; achieved vaccine record time, going another year see/feel return true normality, ever-present danger virus mitigated degree feel need measures. vaccines trusted poorer countries

I'm sorry really true. be, poorer countries also tend lower literacy rates highly prone sway conspiracy theories.

Conspiracy theories rage across Africa vaccines western plot destroy African race. parts Middle East vaccination programs seen western cover operation CIA (that got Bin Laden all). that, American anti-vaxxers finding fertile ground spreading beliefs developing countries, much evangelicals came them. Coming one slower preferable rushing go back one cases sky rocket again.... miracle buy every single dose get dirty hands without regards countries. waiting next genius saying proof prevents infection shoudl keep distancing 2029 find online. German funding Pfizer September. oxford vaccine (... oxford) received funding payment around $1bn double amount funding germany spent vaccine (in total funding paying manufacturing) Neither I. blame leaving lot us dark even acting like plan rest us. We're heading another wave infections absolutely happening. completely unnecessary absolutely ridiculous happening. literally weeks away getting place could start feel like normal much, much lower risk getting sick. agree. Literally thing worried getting vaccines passport argument. 

I don‚Äôt want us go life worried person sitting next us game vaccinated shouldn‚Äôt matter not. It‚Äôs prerogative. Maybe definitely passed peak cases death accounts due vaccines. Claiming impending doom feels like boy cried wolf. Especially since we're almost end cold flu season time next month glut vaccines. great news. know anything yet long immunity one dose lasts? know sounds pretty tin-foil hat-ish, places sign affidavit, I'm worried health insurers might get ahold info use future. Schools require proof vaccination admission. It‚Äôs novel thing, ‚Äòpersonal violations‚Äô. life now, live community health everyone‚Äôs business. Thank choosing get vaccinated! thought US third world country Gucci belt? That‚Äôs EUropeans telling us everyday. Missouri one worst nation vaccine responses, mostly due poor allocation vaccines early stages caused huge unmet demand St Louis Kansas City. finally mass vaccination events past weeks thousands vaccinated days demand still remains high. Missouri opened Phase 2 today everyone becoming eligible April 9th. site huge operational  Let's hope so. However, knuckleheads getting vaccinated going get brutally dealt variants, tearing younger people Brazil Europe right now. God help them. studies trials don‚Äôt really show protection 14 day mark. That‚Äôs cases non vaccinated group started increasing vaccinated group not. Lockdown preferable lockdown??? So, wouldn‚Äôt make vaccines useless people bodies don‚Äôt produce enough antibodies? 

I hate COVID. EU also whole lot poorer US. EU poor countries within union. Dunno you‚Äôre getting downvoted...we don‚Äôt open Marxist‚Äôs governor positions.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* means AZ effectively defrauded EU claimed bound commitments would impede delivery EU. Gotcha. That‚Äôs CDC director said. They‚Äôre quoting her. seems CDC jumped shark. decided public referendum. dont see comparable point EU 447 million people, US 328. 

On per capita basis US donated EU. 

Let shout want.  Absolutely. exciting 90% reduction transmission basically floor talk estimating reduction transmission. would expect fully vaccinated mean chances spreading COVID anybody else reduced nearly 99% factor things like reduced viral load/shedding reduction time severity symptoms addition 90% reduction infection.

TL;DR - like shot. time, CDC updating travel recommendations requirements.

are trolling? income legal change IRS requirements report it. Capone report illegal income properly convicted exactly that. Obviously reported income, would (rightfully) given Law enforcement ability investigate income came from, would lead proof crimes that's fault caused actions. 

This bar serving alcohol without license, lockdown. deadly carry jail sentences. Yeah mean. I‚Äôm sure common sense... pro mask even ‚Äúpro-er‚Äù vaccine. take soon available you. Government dragging feet this. aren‚Äôt mutually exclusive. Ones better form protecting thing. actually put effort search yourself, find that. 

Stop using ""show science"" rallying cry ignore experts. addition others said, go ahead prepare fact covid booster shots going become annual thing like flu shot. People *will* arguing need more, virus going away summer need long-term action prevent becoming bad again.  responsible people Oh understand EU always shouting biggest donator COVAX. US donated 2 billion USD, 2 still come.
The EU donated around 2.6 billion USD. 
Always thought lying, seems rest small technicality. Thought US actually donated 4 billion USD already. Honestly, US UK probably fine travel since vaccinating well yeah, hear sentiment ""world getting back normal"" lot true mean everyone progressing once. COVID-19 epidemic United States *every* American wants vaccinated actually fully dosed.

After time, whatever level infections, hospitalizations, death occurs result 1) people refuse vaccinated; 2) people really bad luck fully vaccinated, get infected sick nonetheless - acceptable.

Until then, however, attitude ""it's over"" ""everything go back normal now"" reckless unfair waiting get vaccinated. absolutely feel her. get position unless absolutely care, obviously does. agree advise hunker little longer. sucks. I'll honest particularly care human life much,

Well really think we're gonna get anywhere believe this. 

Your second paragraph sad me, hope able find meaning life empty comfort. Impending doom. Wow, headline jumped shark. compare approach UK? CDC allowed visits fully vaccinated individuals, I'm sure person fine vacationing alone. now, data single dose efficacy exist made call.

As said elsewhere thread understand make choice balancing existing data risk lives lost waited. simply making point chose go source tested data - phase 3 trial dosage schedule. works. multiplicative, two shots 64% effectiveness (80% x 80% = 64%). elaborate bit more? apologies. resistance/antibodies etc. wondering fight infection? Would different received shot four days ago? People concerned long term effect specific vaccine would actually get much greater health benefits focusing long term effects of:

\-Plastic chemicals leaching food water

\-Car tyres shedding plastic air

\-Pollution cars industry ruining air

All known scientifically proven kill harm millions people per year. create venn diagram people concerned issues people care long term effect vaccines, overlap. Public policy way driven unattainable goal preventing variants. variants 100% inevitable point. Yeah, places lockdowns better places severe restrictions. please link

Updated Mar. 8, 2021 Weirdos like would happy live perpetual lockdown wouldn‚Äôt Well yeah can't imagine cumulative numbers going go down, obviously it'll peak 12 million *for first time.* Yep. USA opposite EU. Containment strategies (variable lockdowns states, mask wearing, lack thereof) absolutely awful we‚Äôre top getting country vaccinated least EU handled containment well botched preordering enough vaccines. Yes exactly opening one slowly intending lol rookie mistake, really. Message got vaccine care anyone else schedule yet. know sarcastic, know would actually work. end use one variant specific booster. Especially rest world remains mostly unvaccinated spawning variants left right.  Wow EU. Spent year virtue signaling lol
Spent year laughing america america I'm way ahead 

Virtue signal EU read article idea many vaccinated infections asymptomatic vs symptomatic study? know right. stress it, study focuses effect mRNA vaccines mean J&amp;J shot also highly effective. would favour people actually can‚Äôt pay, sure. shouldn‚Äôt end streets.

But people much pay refuse destroying place they‚Äôre living able get evicted. 30 something year old myself, finding ""leftover"" doses? First Comirnaty this. comes weird names? :D It‚Äôs 15 months. 

Unless think virus HIV type decade latency You‚Äôre unlikely see chronic issues develop children haven‚Äôt already reported cannot believe people cannot tell kidding. understand needed domestic things. get vaccine protected. matter person sitting next not? Yes, usually dedicated place store stuff share others. think things true. Cases increasing enough vaccinations we'll get back normal. I've read ~70% us need protected achieve herd immunity, 100%. weeks? social security card? realize know lot many many many diseases. Yet still go live lives. Yikes. I'd guessed Bakersfield. Burbank?? Ctv super clickbaity Look badge holder amazon. event badges size similar. I‚Äôm saying scared never come houses, want reason everyone epidemiology arms it‚Äôs B117 P1 variants. P1, takes hold, fulfills three possible criteria mutation:

1) Infectious
2) Leathal
3) Resistence Vaccine

The truth keeping distance limiting transmission vaccines ubiquitous avoid types variants. Go listen Osterholm discuss this, he‚Äôs doom gloom, understands aspects pandemic, he‚Äôs also aware could deep don‚Äôt mitigate close finish line. really good analogy actually. Sex education works MUCH better preventing unwanted pregnancies vs abstinence education. Healthy covid education works much better preventing covid vs fear mongering. could gone wrong Trudeau ‚Äòleader‚Äô? ‚ÄúChina, want go vaccine together?‚Äù idiot, Canadians still support him. people bring office supplies work. use information urge vaccines, feel like messaging feels somehow. isnt reaching right people. Hell yes! Mexico could afford stimulus checks, government didn‚Äôt choose to. Instead, government decided throw lot money PEMEX unnecessary infrastructure projects. mine. UKIP-Vaccine? IDK popular would prove current import tax disaster‚Ä¶

The ‚ÄûKeep-Nigel-far-away-Vaccine‚Äú might better. EU/Germany funded BioNTech make sign e.g. Bayer. AZ admitted serve UK first due contracts Something tells popular post subreddit. I'm scientist, believe total exposure helps move study along faster, make efficacy rate look lower results. control group arguably similarly exposed vaccinated group. What's wild national news outlets this, local news negative bias. Covid get infected 60% cases.  agree. Brazilian strain. know. They've known. cards dealt. People made wager. We'll see wins pot. I've got Armor mask. little heavier, comfortable. I'll probably wear gyms grocery stores (since they're still required.) Get second day! Yeah, find kind frustrating. live Philadelphia seems like Kenny wants one-up surrounding areas comes restrictions. They‚Äôre still keeping ridiculous ‚Äúno buying alcohol without food‚Äù mandates even Wolf drops them. It‚Äôs kind fucked up. long going go on? feeling restrictions won‚Äôt change much September. variants collectively Brazil anything it. Sad mean we‚Äôre told? genuinely want know you‚Äôre talking about. trying dick. Emotion clouds facts. help. okay scared, cdc director lay facts encourage people continue masking covid over. Choking makes scientist look unstable unless there's extremely good reason. Cases bit, sad, reason much good news countering it. surgeon tearing surgery, going feel good things. Even risky.

She's leader battle show confidence transparency. Thankfully basically Darwinism people aren‚Äôt doofuses vaccinated. messaging change hospitals overwhelmed covid psych patients think big push caution comes difference acute vs chronic impacts, lack long term data. Kids may sick bad COVID, isn‚Äôt enough data know cause damage isn‚Äôt found 20+ years. IE - heart disease, lung damage, reproductive issues, etc. it‚Äôs unknown, health professionals mainly err side caution. 

That said, teen adult population vaccinate, don‚Äôt see risk 12 high. 2nd graders aren‚Äôt driving dinner parties catch this. would wager guess children get infected family members hygiene isn‚Äôt good needs be. reason elementary school bad cold/flu season.

We virtual daughter year lucky enough without job impacts. school still emailed us COVID cases. 100% caught outside school K-2 class students caught immediate family 0 transmission school. Limited data makes feel better fall 60%+ vaccinated rate we‚Äôre currently going. makes communication much harder, imagine trying college party mask sucks, know I'm old care much. let kids maskless parties want vaccinated. Spot on. lot Covid crisis management comes communication expectation management, ""impending doom"" simply clever way put message.

The idea behind makes lot sense obviously, knows talking about, tragedy thousands people still die even though vaccinations full swing. doomsday talk simply reflect reality lot people understandably dismiss entire message. sub way pessimistic lot last year, become cultishly optimistic. truth between. Things rapidly getting better, another 6-8 weeks risk vulnerable populations ahead.

We almost (in US), we're sick this. bell curve possibilities June 1st rosey prevailing mood. There's risk regardless. wrong say mRNA vaccines clearly far superior j&amp;j AstraZeneca comes infection. latter two seem spout effectiveness hospitalization. 

If choice would pick J&amp;J Pfizer? It‚Äôs getting back normal Arizona finally. 16+ get vaccine (got first shot last Wednesday). Mask mandate lifted stores restaurants still enforce people still wearing masks sanitizing. Restaurants packed, service sucks worse ever, hear life music see people. Yeah understand that, I‚Äôm talking general shots administered. incorrect I've multiple Corona test every single one free. Regardless are. main headline every prime time news broadcast tonight. What, work? I‚Äôm London, 40, sign vaccine time soon me. tip please share. Britons coming side Brexit now? love american see mexican economy saviors.‚Äù save money time keep spreading deadly virus country!‚Äù

Fuck them! Egoist pricks. I'm saying can't detect trends using recent data, I'm saying can't decide whether something concerning without full context. 

It's possible situation hospitalizations doubled last 14 days also concerning. get full picture. P1 widely circulating time frame possible test. Vaccines seem effective P1 although less so. There's gonna still cases. There's gonna increases there. Young kid young adults spreading now. nearby college spring sports postponed weeks due 300-person outbreak. High schools going remote week increase cases. 

You're gonna see blips increases hospitalizations. young mean invincible. BUT, quick blips may always seem. fever goes 102, may need go hospital. I'm COVID case, even go home next day. feel short breath - even anxiety COVID - may drive emergency room. That's another hospitalization. And,... younger people received vaccine MAY underlying conditions know about. hospitalizations anywhere near last year older people immunocompromised vaccinated.

Long story short - yeah, may increase cases, numbers tell fraction story MSM work numbers sell headline. 250% increase sounds grim, right? grim ""jumped 50 175."" 

Doctors CDC always going err side caution weave overly cautious story. Would also mean ability whatsoever transmit virus others fall 90%+ range? people still manage get infected, reduced transmission them? experience first shot. far second bad. looking forward boosters need them. hope Covid evaporates day.  vaccines going end pandemic soon.

I would say ""soon"". still massive amount vaccination work, global infection amounts currently rise.

I would first wait infection amounts significantly go celebrations. Even US still hitting 50k/d. Totally agree. giving something +300M people, don‚Äôt want random event pop everyone blames vaccine it‚Äôs unrelated. got first dose Friday wife got today. nightmare us 2 weeks. young son finally play kids finally say hello world. Fuck virus thank much vaccine makers health care workers distributing it, bring world back normal.  Vaccination rate Canada also gutter. Canadian gov‚Äôd cozied China vaccine Chinese (CanSino) took tech told Canada take hike. Canadian gov‚Äôt pathetic every turn pandemic. Uk came tremendous surge. CA kind situation. hard say vaccines inevitable plunge surge.  misinformation Essentially 25% 70-79 registered waiting appointment dates. New vaccine supply causing dates open retroactively causing problem. worry exactly like this, similar. Places like Alabama Mississippi much lower demand entire population. 2 weeks, can't administer 60% allocated doses, given (until get certain threshold) spread states still high demand.   demographic cohorts. older population, yes. true younger cohorts. Totally separate, original figure efficacy measured trial data. data collected real world, importantly much rigid testing schedule - participants tested weekly, major implications asymptomatic infection/transmission. adds growing body evidence vaccines greatly reduce asymptomatic infection therefore possibility asymptomatic transmission, excellent news. Maybe small minority get fear porn, genuinely scared pandemic continuing due reckless behavior. people would welcome good news long doesn‚Äôt give people confidence lead worse outcome. stop pushing narrative stick facts.

Sir, reddit. Actually, (UW Health employee) said never laminate it. explained told lamination could cause problems ink instructed tell everyone never laminate it. knows. exciting me. feels like future here. eager get MRNA vaccine hope turn MRNA vaccines. solve flu MRNA, stop huge swath deaths. could raise life expectancy incredible amount. difference study looked asymptomatic infections essential workers get tested regularly part jobs. Phase 3 trials generated 94-95% results looked symptomatic infections.

This means two shots, risk symptomatic infection decreases 95% asymptomatic infection 90%. Great news, nonetheless. reddit moment European politicians could take responsibility fact didn‚Äôt order vaccines several weeks UK US placed orders... instead took time try work group get better price middle fucking pandemic.ÔøºÔøº

[But know that‚Äôs gonna work they‚Äôve got convenient scapegoat US gives us 1.5 million vaccine approved use US. Canada gives back 1.5 million future date usable US. Netherlands busy fucking everything fast possible, please try reach us better time... ever comes... Tell people lost loved ones due covid. people bend rules longer go on.
People selfish. know joking want remind everyone Vaccines meant prevent corona virus, meant prevent severe symptoms, hospitalization death due corona virus. don‚Äôt **know** unless study. work don‚Äôt know effective without large study people looking themselves, people going looking ways harm, could. I've physically assaulted wearing mask, listen fellow townsfolk brag deliberating infecting others trying tilt housing market, staff local businesses crowd get belligerent even asking step away mask up. Even vaccine works -if half gets vaccinated - things never go back normal I've seen. sources young people hospitalized higher rate variants causing severe disease? 

My understanding young people hospitalized rate, young people getting COVID. 

My understanding variants none shown higher mortality.   original strain mutations ? scary reports coming Brazil Africa effective ship sailed. want normal back. oh I'm well aware. try tell 20 year olds asthma they're really risk get pissed me, I've stopped trying fair, Moderna didn‚Äôt noticeable manufacturing presence prior 2020. ‚Äònew‚Äô them. 

If EU wanted pay billion front new factory might different story. That's reasonable conclusion - study, 5 people received J&amp;J. Yeah, sending friends. send any. Biden constituents. fuck shit. makes want openly stop complying.

Oh yeah, fuck health everyone else's around me! CDC director said something like! haven‚Äôt made official statement haven‚Äôt given timeline 1b 1c. I‚Äôve seen quotes governor health director saying ‚Äúhope‚Äù open eligibility may 1. It‚Äôs tested. guess enough assuage fears. ever tested enough that? Lol. mean say ‚Äúliving rent free‚Äù someone‚Äôs head? I‚Äôm quoting factual paragraphs article. Shake fist sky facts bother you. is. Impending doom, *if guidelines continued followed time being.* obvious overstatement trying emphasize gravity situation. 


Everyone's focused one damn line they're ignoring rest statement. Need supply wait really? thought Manhattan Yes. check immigration status. it‚Äôs insulting say vaccine simply means you‚Äôre stupid?

You‚Äôre self-proclaimed vaccine expert trolling vaccine post 120,000 people died UK. 

I really don‚Äôt care feel insulted. ashamed yourself. people come standpoint lockdowns something like property Universe, completely inevitable necessary, pointless argue. MD‚Äôs MPH‚Äôs like Dr. Monica Gandhi don‚Äôt share ‚Äúimpending doom‚Äù message. can‚Äôt make credentialism central argument. first also nothing, sore arm nothing else. lasted maybe 3 days. really gonna believe reddit actual CDC experts make feel better? going open May 1  EU brexit revenge conspiracy credentials nowhere near hers, makes even disappointing. understand someone obviously brilliant could saying something absurd goes recently released data, including CDC itself. Pennsylvania opening eligibility May 1  There‚Äôs highly contagious, deadly virus going around. People can‚Äôt eating touching things close, confined spaces, especially beginning didn‚Äôt know much it. Federal government fucked acting slow sending people money able afford close. nah. understand priority groups.

That said, priority groups given practically 3 months, definitely time lax given vaccine few, yes. Disappeared no. I'm surprised. Like people, hold couch days, take DayQuil, get back business catch flu. would go doctor get tested, days telemedicine, emergency connected serious underlying condition, one going see you. time yet health clinics start seeing people minor complaints. phone/video appointments.  tests flu...no records occurances.  flu disappear. tracking did. heavy soul, viewing co-workers, family friends pretending things fine I‚Äôm one exaggerating continue live lives carefree selfish ignorant. I‚Äôve live life phone screen computer screen 14 months. Makes wonder sacrifice socializing worth shit. 50% country immunized immune prior infection factored fear 4th wave Twitter MSM absolutely fuming right now. Lol don‚Äôt em buddy

Because made up. People don‚Äôt pull things ass, unlike saying getting Covid bigger risk health taking vaccine.

Wow. Flat ignorance here. 

Good bye. ‚ÄúImpending doom‚Äù implies something like NYC April 2020, 3,500 deaths per day saw December. 

If it‚Äôs that, really needs focus phrasing DIRECTOR CDC. Well said ... agree 100%. fully understand people want resume life knew March 2020 we're yet months. level denial seeing forum despite evidence contrary dangerous. 

One thing keep pointing people increasing case count middle vaccination process increase odds mutation defeat existing vaccines. want? Heck no, let's keep mask wearing, social distancing, restrictions months. want feel good mean get ignore reality pretend experts wrong. 15% public fully vaccinated, even takes weeks immunity develop. vaccines also perfect, new variants slightly resistant them. Cases hospitalizations rise again. US never come close flattening curve people continue pretend like virus exist anymore. Noone wants this, must what's necessary. Think way, grandparents survive bombings war, surely stay home follow basic protocols experts right?? Twitter. jackasses live special reality everything cataclysmic problem gonna keep I've since last year play safe. Good luck everyone else, I'm claiming life back May (a couple weeks second dose). 1/4 country want morons vaccines social distancing that's government's problem, mine - I'm done. wonder would work, can't inject vaccines randomly without study results. Virginia, locals aware one sites...and state turning people away arriving doses thrown out. :| Agreed, definitely informed word implies would remiss praise health experts, professionals advisers pushing approach, clearly wonders. normal. sister said felt like someone taken bat arm couple days. us India.. :( I‚Äôm expecting boosters November variants anyhow. may chasing variants years question might moot bit.  Excuse me? What's wrong caution? average joe tell vaccinated asshole? 


And areas (like mine) people getting vaccinated still spreading around? Viruses mutate they? areas like mine continue like we're going see mutation might lower vaccines efficacy.  


God damn, we're fire yet. Telling people fuck advocating continued caution there's still \~1000 deaths day pretty fucked. US needed cases come crashing month 6 weeks. likely needed international travel though  can't find written source, apparently said television representative Norwegian Institute Public Health.   hand need communicate effective vaccine is, 80% population anti vaxxer 4 months ago.

But get point. fucked up. people fucked up. EU fucked up. Yay finally Colorado, I‚Äôve keeping eye state getting jealous seeing states date everyone get vaccine. happy  Good decision leave! lot people there's good reason it. hope best next state residence. wear god-damm mask. hard, saves lives.

This false. 

Also, stop ""it saves lives"" shit. allow anybody private car. would save lives. shut fast food, ban smoking alcohol. would save lives. isnt valid point make, dont get infringe people think better. People die - thats part alive society. 

Oh reminds me, annual death numbers out. notible difference 2020 2019, 2018, 2017 etc. number people died every year current population. *yawn*. article states: Pfizer completed initial enrollment process younger people back February. **And end March, company expects data 12- 15-year-olds regarding safety efficacy vaccines.** goes Moderna, also begun testing children 12 years age older. fact, Moderna launching trial specifically tests mRNA-based vaccine children young six months old.

So could much sooner July August 12-15 year olds. Hopefully. get damage uptake certainly seen becomes available younger people, already lower uptake older age groups. Needless problems created - UK given people anyone else amazing them. know, I've NY since fall. Still VA driver's license. Still sure I'll allowed get vaccine. plan returning VA June new job starts. effects infection spread studied now. Seems kid silly say guess better someone else's guess, despite fact hard data infection rates, data ability vaccine prevent serious illness. 

That said great news! need get everyone vaxxed. stop. It‚Äôs tooo awesome. Asking people remain cautious fine. Warning people impending doom nonsensical. Normal. arm hurt 48 hours totally fine afterwards. Romania top list years now, finally get go September! Hoping hit medieval castles. Things germany looking grim light end tunnel Communicating ""one effective defense"" country one worst covid situation world dangerous, irresponsible could result false sense security people. mid February got first dose Pfizer vaccine. traveled 4 days first shot (yeah stupid) tested positive Covid exactly 7 days that, likely result traveling.

After dodging bullet entire year annoyed missed window immunity basically one week; however, symptoms extremely light- sneezing congestion along smell loss 2 days it. felt less worse regular cold, I‚Äôm sure vaccine least provided partial protection prevented advancing past minor symptoms (and also prevented long term effects far tell).

I got 2nd shot 10 days tested positive tiny fever night sweats. all, vaccine seems pretty effective safe. would love hear opinion provide actual rebuttal description think. often reddit response, ""I disagree person, they're stupid."" disheartening alienates divides society. Mixing vaccines currently permitted anywhere. study UK take many months final results. doubt many countries let unvaccinated foreigners in. vaccine passports way huge ethical issue. lol. low rate mortality spreading, fearful car wrecks obesity depression. 

NYC shithole, going get lot worse. EMA's safety committee meeting today experts haemotology discuss blood clots, perhaps new information. still update EMA's webpage though.  Exactly. really help. adamant finding vaccine mother would waited could walk corner CVS get like flu shot. Ducey wants us dead; pretty clear now. pandemic over

But it‚Äôs mostly over, least US really wonder plan school systems going back classroom time others moving work home. Everything see news like ""let's something wait maybe shouldn't"" considered harsh Sweden even compared countries plans exponential growth factored weight gain? fair, province 65+ 50+ 65 health concerns eligible vaccines. So. really change vaccine roll currently. several weeks i'm sure drop numbers age groups point i'm guessing expect information cause/treatment readibly available. 

THe majority healthcare workers, long term care facilities already vaccinate pfizer change either. Thanks. Forgive shocked government shred competency feel sentiment hard. torturous year us stayed homes panicked older loved ones. I‚Äôll 2 weeks post second shot 1 week I‚Äôm never going back house again. Lol don‚Äôt em buddy, I‚Äôm p sure find article someone‚Äôs face becoming paralyzed taking vaccine sub. regards pregnancies, there‚Äôs whole bunch ‚Äúfact checkers‚Äù assuring people everything ‚Äútotally safe‚Äù pregnant women, shows there‚Äôs people talking experiencing this. People don‚Äôt pull things ass, unlike saying getting Covid bigger risk health taking vaccine. What‚Äôs source that? don‚Äôt any, cause there‚Äôs long term studies vaccine came PAST YEAR pushed onto us media. understand concerned, certainly reason be, think right now, people want CDC director talking emotional plea, matter fact CDC director. 

A year personal pleas clearly aren‚Äôt working anymore populace heavily experiencing pandemic fatigue. factual blunt realistic presser would effective trying go emotional point lifting restrictions soon, COVID death preventable death.

OK then; time lower speed limit 10 mph across country, stop preventable deaths!

Or remember there's tradeoff make. Re: Kenya, I'd worried lockdown implemented *while there.* Could severely fuck ability get home airlines cancel flights whatnot. xXCovizhield420Xx know NY much bigger city.... mean can‚Äôt leave Texas cases, hospitalizations deaths declining despite opening up? Seems like something right know, seriously can't believe much people complain stupid things. slight inconvenience? Yup, that's ok. anything, makes feel urge opposite. hospitalizations rising, even fully vaccinated people getting hospitalized.  maybe actually follow advice...for once. would trust anyone sub, they're warning people good fucking reason. every state lifted type restriction.

The real question, party pooper tells everyone stay home two weeks? US far point. It‚Äôs hospitals overwhelmed, fucking close getting people eligible vaccinations prevent transmission let‚Äôs right thing tiny bit longer. Makes sense even considering fears direct blockade, former situation EU would count F&amp;F doses exports even produced UK making EU look even good exports UK look worse even step part agreed upon supply chain companies really 'export' per se. . trust American people.

The American people proven can't trusted right thing pandemic already. Man, oh man. Never come NYC, please. want covid. cases rising deadly variants spreading over? sub grounded reality. simply looking emotion want see. need follow guidelines set CDC, wait everyone get fully vaccinated let immunity start kicking in. thanks people like failing.

I'm scared even imagine numbers would look vaccines effective. Even they're rising. wonder additional cases are. seen news somehow bulb dims little more! mean open mouth kissing? remember days. worry much. Honestly see residency continuum cutting move gradual kind OK see NH resident purposes resident purposes long anything defrauds one two states (e.g. maintain physical residence Massachusetts claiming still live New Hampshire extended period time commit tax fraud). facts are, roots recent ties NH, ID designates resident New Hampshire marks official resident database somewhere thus bolsters claim still maintain status resident particular purposes, planning going cause egregious harm either two states. It‚Äôs important look state/region. previous surges, every state/region affected same. is, happened Argentina tourist returning Mexico. whole group took flight back home shown negative tests arrival 30 turned positive. Fuck people. finally watching clip think claims crying little exaggerated. showing humanity-ya'll remember right? OG COVID would still great bulk infections period, study probably can't tell us whole lot vaccine effectiveness vs variants concern. best data vaccine efficacy vs variants still UK Israeli studies (showed mRNA vaccines still highly effective vs B1.1.7) portion J&amp;J phase 3 trial took place South Africa (showed J&amp;J still highly effective vs B1.351 variant). Brazil head hurts rolling eyes hard announcement. think ok wedding, especially California Yeah science want find ‚Äúhow‚Äù circumstances happened. able proof en replicate help world take measures prevent similar disasters. lease. side effects? Yeah, seems like one decisions make beginning stick it.  time UK US making decisions little data available effective one shot Phizer Moderna were. UK strategy definitely risky unproven (and lightly studied) approach. would speculate Brits found strategy working would easier time switching back (4 countries smaller dense population) vs US 50 States rural population. errors he? Moderna well! idea you‚Äôre talking about. one, Walmart can‚Äôt sued someone catching covid store. Same! I've informed everyone know NYC. people know still hesitant, can't wait get it. Hopefully knowing someone got vaccine relieve hesitancy some. states island Yankees good day trip closed pandemic. 

Step one get ferry beer outside beautiful day
Step two catch minor league baseball game don‚Äôt care result, enjoying hotdog another beer sitting sun.
Step three get back ferry enjoy last beer upper deck sun sets. 

Not bad way spend Saturday. Best part stadium right next ferry building. That's pretty depressing attitude have. That‚Äôs works. doses increase protection exponentially. second dose 80^2 = 6400% effective COVID. two weeks flatten curve, right? Given US Dec-March so, infections would mostly OG COVID. study probably can't tell us much efficacy vs variants. said, variants concern primarily effect could unvaccinated populations. fact trying hard hide stuff destroy evidence kind point idea happen? sure. I‚Äôm pretty sure Canucks still hold grunge former imperial overlords....

/s Thankfully, Merkel idiot knows deaths come delayed infections reacting bodies pile unfathomably stupid. Currently, ECUs beginning fill up. heavily depends context. case headline saying ""Africa"" seem problematic me. J&amp;J technically gave ""the African Vaccine Acquisition Trust"" run African Union represents 55 countries Africa. Given people unfamiliar African Vaccine Trust given people probably know AU represents every single African country lot easier, factually accurate, say ""Africa"" headline go greater depth article. 

While usually saying ""Africa"" overgeneralization always overgeneralization said something true every African country. Similarly said ""Europe east Urals"" overgeneralization every single European country located East Urals definition. matter Europe unified statement true them. organization, easily say productivity skyrocketed. people prefer go office (at least every day) commute around NYC steal 2+ hours every day! big projects people engaged, relaxed, communicative productive. org (not profit) old school NEVER allowed WFH circumstances so, I'd happily surprised even went hybrid. know I'll go back daily misery cr0wded 2hr round trip subway commute. I've productive time workout, home projects.  


Some management feel like need 'keep eye' staff they're office, even 'lazy' staff productive. Stop scared. Issue direct guidance capacity, mask mandates, large crowds. tie federal funding covid rates. Want pork money state budget? compliant federal guidelines rates need dropping. Seriously. 

Almost every state already announced total vaccine eligibility early April. mid May everyone wants one first shot 14+ days ago many already second shot. 

The challenge shift encouraging vaccine hesitant get starting ship vaccines overseas. 

When everyone know vaccinated, one going wear mask they‚Äôre partying someone‚Äôs house. they‚Äôll comfortable going bars without masks. 

Declines mask enforcement naturally follow this, pretty quickly they‚Äôll gone. 

By June 1, going history Americans. True, still misleading convered media. happening technology developed fighting cancer also used Covid, way around. course fighting virus via vaccine child's play compared cancer, infer success latter now. couple flown Britain, rest know one another.  come Singapore 10 widely dispersed places: Bahrain, Canada, Indonesia, Myanmar, Netherlands, Philippines, South Korea, United Arab Emirates, Britain United States.  somehow, part Covid-19 cluster. genetic sequence virus caused infection similar anything else.

I think need Agatha Christie enough J&amp;J vaccine supplied yet country, since recently rolled unlike Pfizer Moderna. demographic threat longer Jewish state. Arabs poorer naturally higher birth rate, fact high among Jewish population unique developed world. Take 95% mean exact result first trial, gives idea results trials around. real world tests, see results ranging 90% 98/99% overtime average towards limit. scientific results writen reflect small uncertainties. bullshit Trump admin did, hiding bad news, least cry actually announced it. professional. face. awful excuse human being. Yuck. Gross. ü§¢ told Great Apes also collaborative parents, jive theory that's spurred us go Apes human?

I'll say real slow since seen sort cognitive disability. Apes also exhibit collaborative behavior, meaning collaborative behavior separates us wanna sure tear muscle something aggrevate soreness day after. Quebec? Sorry I'm dense, find article. say gives conclusion? really want believe this! Biden's people lol ""Be afraid told"" apparently Biden's public messaging platform. I'm getting serious post 9/11 Bush vibes. ain't complicated. accept lease agreement proof residency. actually make feel lot better! Thank you. appreciate it, date twin! Could covid exposure last several days? YES!!!

So schedule appointment? I'm trying get done ASAP. Cool cool, I'll let people printed cards know. importantly, still measures place. They're thinking relaxing mask-mandate outdoors, still keeping indoors crowded areas while. count it, restrictions change way living last much longer.  think big part societal expectations me. don‚Äôt want labeled bad guy going ahead wedding. efficacy calculation actually takes account person days (i.e. accounts time) adjusts factors, plus wide confidence interval due size study sample.

From 116,657 person-days participants unvaccinated, 161 PCR-confirmed infections identified (incidence rate = 1.38/1,000 person-days). 13 days first-dose second-dose vaccination immune status considered indeterminate (67,483 person-days), 33 PCR-confirmed infections identified excluded outcome. Two sources partially immunized person-days reported. Five PCR-confirmed infections reported 15,868 person-days ‚â•14 days first dose among receive second dose study period; three PCR-confirmed infections reported 25,988 person-days ‚â•14 days first dose receipt second dose. Taken together, represents eight PCR-confirmed infections occurred 41,856 person-days partial immunization (‚â•14 days first dose second dose; incidence rate = 0.19/1,000 person-days). Three PCR-confirmed infections occurred 78,902 person-days full immunization (‚â•14 days second dose; incidence rate = 0.04/1,000 person-days). Estimated adjusted vaccine effectiveness full immunization 90% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 68%‚Äì97%); vaccine effectiveness partial immunization 80% (95% CI = 59%‚Äì90%) (Table 2). Weird people seem problem taking appointments states. Lol.... difference 16 30.... ok, means probably 16. Outbreak.Info

Updated 2h ago
9,169 arm hurt bit day. Every time slept, woke less soreness arm. also moved arm lot keep muscles use (I every shot get). Try moving/stretching arm more, get much sleep (sleep also helps immune system may make vaccine effective). NATALYA SIMONOVA  case would zero worries. would require vaccination adults. me. Seriously, makes sick kids got Covid daycare (they fine, thankfully) big risk, one take keep roof heads. üòï 4chan troll different viewpoints. would never stick label like suggest bothered European, feel going like. study long ago showed four-fold decrease viral load among vaccinated people subsequently get infected. doubt level ""presymptomatic"" spread close naive infection, point well taken really know. coming way P1 (Brazil Variant) gets US en-masse. J&amp;J tested efficacy. AZ / Pfizer/ Moderna tested original coronavirus UK/South African Variants. even vaccination lot people going get sick. Hopefully stocking PPE huge numbers metropolitan cities nationwide. 


Brazil got point though, inept leadership Bolsonario, ignored virus almost entirely recently. last week starting negotiations start vaccine program. Yes, Last Week, read right. almost vaccinations help curb rise, behind everyone else getting might awhile able even staunch flood cases/deaths. Bolsonario repetitively said populace ""quit whining"" virus. singlehandedly making Brazil go this. health administration cannot function countermanding everything say, here. say nothing respect medical professionals trying work conditions , hope things take turn better sake sake huge/highly populated country.  Jesus, subreddit rails. She‚Äôs literally asking unvaccinated people get lazy bare minimum precautions y‚Äôall acting like opened Book Revelations sent year lockdown. ONE CDC anything gain fearmongering doomsaying! There‚Äôs nothing nefarious behind asking reasonable amount caution. I'm OP, I'll say hear people talk they're scared variants say things like ""there's many taking over, frightening"" ""some seem evade immune response could cause reinfection"" fortunately seem true B.117, real issue increased transmissibility possible higher mortality rate, probably due higher viral load. government take precautions stop giving vaccine young people time being. numerous vaccines near perfect safety records produced companies much transparent data.  Seems like I've read local governors stepped started trying help. hoping local efforts succeed. awful. would legitimately happy see Biden replace give strict instructions speak publicly. know what's funny this? Trump killed lot fucking people got away it.  CDC says vaccines stop asymptomatic spread, folks. Ticketmaster isn‚Äôt actually vaccine checks. December first vaccines released understand either. seemed like vaccines wildly rushed. later learned Moderna invents great vaccine 48 hrs. normal world would taken decade plus prove efficacy safety without bankrupting company and/or something like challenge trials generally considered unethical.

I wonder long took us realize vaccine driven polio real thing? pretty sure got oral version polio vaccine 99% seems high 95% effective preventing symptomatic cases roughly 50% spread virus happens pre-symptomatic. even like 93% huge. That's going wipe virus out. Yeah, free temporary I'm currently getting domain real server. work anyone? What? say 220 million vaccines enough Africa. said hope everyone else pitches more. Africa 1.2 billion people. 

Seriously, world talking about? saved million lives, good year. yo, yeah bruh. it. said something UK wrong? millions people miserable died. sure point Bring signed letter parents, even better piece mail addressed address it. understand people pretty flexible, point we‚Äôre demand constrained want get shots people‚Äôs arms. science says

There's ""science dogma"" attitude again. know, also Switzerland Thailand, still narrative continued almost got frostbite mine. 6 1/2 hours waiting line outside 20 degree f . toes almost fell definitely frustrating, sacrifice (combined everyone else's sacrifice) make difference. Case numbers healthcare system overload would way worse everywhere, parts population made sacrifices. look basically nonexistent flu seasons past year know that's true. Hang there! Something something *dangerous variants* Sure, simple that, paper. enough warrant investigation, reckon greater good still getting vaccine, factors consider. We've gone couple weeks ago EU. That‚Äôs funny! You‚Äôre joking right? Yep, odds ‚Äùtrue"" date 100 millionth first dose administered (rather reported) today tomorrow, ending March 103-105m administered. CDC administration data show averages 3-3.5 days administration date report date. Neither. means x unvaccinated people get sick, vaccinated people 80 percent lower chance get sick situation. Argh. don‚Äôt know Brazilian bat prediction. use canary coal mine. issue Scandinavia. Canada. Germany joins game over. yeah. really wearing mask herd immunity. Vaccination procurement unrelated Brexit though, myth. Actually UK started program still de facto EU (all rules still applied). would've less year morons listened first second times lockdowns no, keep walking around without masks going etc. Many many connections! tunnel session 'ts_1qRgKvCiKfBUQgV0aYOkEOrWPGA' violated rate-limit policy 20 connections per minute initiating 33 connections last 60 seconds. Please decrease inbound connection volume upgrade paid plan additional error encountered was: ERR_NGROK_702

It‚Äôs dead Yo, got vaccinated (J&amp;J) side effects, would okay work tomorrow lift weights could injure muscle injection? mean Dont really agree, euro used currency, quid equals euro. pound used currency l quid equals pounds. stupid, pointless argument difference perception used America, saying something x quid, I'd assume talking dollars.  Here's different study little easier digest. 2nd 4 infographics shows progression immunity week 1 though week 4, improvements shot Hospitalizations rising half US. Give rest already ""it's over!"" stuff. months go 80% adults vaxxed June. b.1.1.7 still fuq things April. 

I hate Biden Trump Biden pretty realistic message regarding covid far overly pessimistic Novavax appear dragging feet asked sign final contract EU. really know why, suspect think they'll meet targets given AZ treated missed targets probably thinks better avoid EU they're confident. Dumbest take website today. actual daily numbers rising... lot. Like fourth wave rising. even one 6 years ago/I 25 trying go trade school, needed order one sign up. I've always known number heart never physical card needed one lol. Here‚Äôs one good. keep mega bloks shit vaccine away result spending much time subreddit back January, 
even today looked around stats discussions reddit, immediately stories people taste three months next three months food tasting like poop I‚Äôll going bbq friends 2 weeks. We‚Äôre vaccinated imagine July 4 almost everyone wants one one Isolation, forced closure businesses...that's shit Americans getting done with, masking. know! like social security card lost long time ago. need get state ID renewed, can't get renewed need social security card. can't get without state ID. said: fully vaccinated, longer need mask. 

What said: areas (like mine) people getting vaccinated still spreading around? 

You're literally arguing something say. Slow down, read, listen, think. think lot people liked WFH first starting go crazy. could see hybrid schedules becoming common WFH probably sustainable lot companies especially ones need teamwork personal interactions. Agreed. speak/write English fine. Get vaccinated. protected. someone else gets sick problem.

If unvaccinated kids get sick, absolutely problem. methodology routine testing vaccinated unvaccinated precisely I've waiting see someone do. infections healthy, working-age people barely symptomatic, way know vaccine reduced actual infections regular testing. Oral contraceptives independent risk factor clotting Sorry I‚Äôm politics guy, trump kill? tried impeach him?  Like answer prayers Hospitalizations rising half US. Give rest already ""it's over!"" stuff. months go b.1.1.7 still fuq things April mean clearly understand even thought Astrazeneca UK company starters. point probably going matter much given inertia vaccination. hold even two weeks reopen two weeks think would actually okay know going little later claims expert infectious diseases like, always bad takes gets called actual experts.  Nice little 0 fact propaganda piece here. could make story people die car crashes pretend incredibly dangerous activity nobody part take in. talk real risk hospitalization let people decide risk worth taking vs indefinite self isolation. Second that, I‚Äôm S√£o Paulo. We‚Äôre literally hands state governors new health minister, seems finally reasonable guy. Bolsonaro, can‚Äôt remember last time did/said something everyone‚Äôs good, anyway, cannot recognize man nation leader, psychopath. genuinely believe civil liberties exist necessary survival? Hospitals overwhelmed. It‚Äôs going okay everyone!!!! relax know Novavax trial flu shot 65 80% effective done 2019-20 flu season. 15% normal help enough. Canada signed contracts 100 million vaccines lot legal jargon looks similar contracts best effort enforcement.

If America starts exporting tens millions vaccines Canada contracts stipulates cannot exported Canada... Canada gonna sue they're gonna win. really like politicians public health officials tell stay home, need avoid travel, dining out, must always mask up, etc see going Mexico, going vacation homes, attending baseball games, eating fine dining establishments, etc.

Why anyone listen clear believe words? stay safe! single usually 3-400 something(?) flu/pneumonia deaths per day March

if talking week shouldnt put per day :p 100% correct. even vaccination lot people going get sick.

There's scientific basis statement. say know much effectiveness reduced variant.  think also matter far point. It'd one thing 2 months ago struggle get appointment, especially seniors tech-adept, much easier require knowing exact steps timing administration website. take pick? there‚Äôs countless articles sub internet reduction. 

The trials based symptomatic covid. 

This based asymptomatic covid. Brazil slow get vaccinated, starting pick pace actually pretty good vaccination infrastructure place, problem really don‚Äôt enough doses. Really US smart would sending AstraZaneca stockpile way don‚Äôt really need leaving Brazil doses global health problem. congrats good responsible !

you'll almost certainly safe mitigate anybody unvaccinated tested. already released updated guidelines vaccinated people would imagine vaccination rates increase, continue update guidelines loosen restrictions.

The issue cases plateauing high level, states even seeing increases case numbers hospitalizations. facing potential third wave deadly work reach critical amount vaccinated people, lot people die next 6 weeks stay careful.

So many people stopped caring entirely, things potential get really bad vaccine efforts kick in. Remember, even enough get high number vaccinated people, need least 2 weeks people get shots start seeing reduction risk infection. blame CDC careful guidance get enough shots arms start advising people take less precautions. OBEN BIDEN

noooo, like Yup. Canadian way. Pretend Murica big bad meanie care health people, pretend they're assholes sharing miracle cure Canadians stead giving people. Turns spending infinite money per capita health care pretty beneficial there's medical emergency. knew? ONE CDC anything gain fearmongering doomsaying!

She literally talks impending doom lol...

""I‚Äôm going pause here. I‚Äôm going lose script, I‚Äôm going reflect recurring feeling impending doom,‚Äù wonder people actually *enjoy* wearing seatbelts safe. Yes!! worried got covid smtgh!!!

Glad u r back! Bloomberg always dramatic headlines  Wasn‚Äôt conspiracy non profit vaccine? Abso-effing-lutely.  point gonna amazing COVID really becomes flu bro.  

What's super exciting maybe we'll tech, infrastructure inspiration get 80% effective flu vaccine. That‚Äôs thought too- get everyone one second risk one mentioned zero deaths. Bingo. wish position everyone wanted get vaccinated truthfully many states already supply demand country supply far greater demand matter weeks. many send European friends? round number mind. Ireland also using slang = 'whatever used currency is'.

Lets say specific British isles.  first time seen efficacy infection data Moderna? can't find broke Moderna Pfizer apart? confirm. American. lunatics running assylum they're pissed lashing out. Gov Polis absolutely nailing right calls since pandemic started. aggressive restrictions -- even close -- he's managed things appropriately humbly.  adults want shot already able get one april may. think timeline would much different. laugh people think WFH ‚Äúnew norm‚Äù. Local &amp; state economy‚Äôs rely ton daily commute office workers. WFH barely lasts two months IMO. Deaths dropping uptick &lt; 3 weeks old. Yet corporate America stay open Walmarts world allowing anti-maskers stores time. Governments go small mom pop stores shut they're following orders easier. Bow corporate overlords. ""Well saw article one guy like 20 got really sick""   areas easy accessibility everyone. resolved 2-3 weeks. Anyone wants get fully vaccinated correct schedule begin April. enough supply issue justify changing course especially J&amp;J ramping substantially April want 1 shot. taken care of, bother much someone else chooses risk getting sick? 

I never hospital due covid.

but I've lockdown long everyone else.

because WHOLE TIME.. full hospitals = lockdown.

&amp;#x200B;

I give 2 shits get sick die covid.

***just home hospital*** 

so rest us go mention effortlessly forged.

**Microsoft, Salesforce, Oracle Join Hands Develop COVID-19 Vaccine Ticketmaster Plans Check Vaccine Status Concerts: wait telling i've putting mail dishwasher good reason?!?!?! Norway *basically* EU country though. jurisdiction European courts, accepts EU laws part EEA. different position UK Turkey. also, importantly, uses European Medicines Agency part European vaccine procurement programme. Right, I'm saying *like* wearing one I'll also happy we're done them, I'm adult lot say many people respected. almost like weird anti-victim-blaming. Yes, always percent people severely compromised, etc, mean 9x% people stay inside absolutely nothing forever ever. right, evil wrong adjective. Thank god wasn‚Äôt meant impress you. ""Impending doom"" coming 70% Americans 65 gotten shot? third adults have? every state opening eligibility adults next month?

For God's sake, ***not*** going ""holding little longer?"" Maybe Biden address like he's talking subjects people would willing listen him. saying ""I'll advise lifting mask mandates hospitalizations reach number"" ""I'll advise opening everything many adults vaccinated."" anything like all.

He's saying hold little longer over, over, again. God infuriating. hell point anything we're going facing ""impending doom"" ""emerging variants"" rest lives? even bother vaccine masks anything we're going told hold longer longer forever?

There absolutely optimism Biden administration messages. apathy **his fault.** politician **failing** inspire confidence public health efforts that's people care anymore. understand would even possible understand that. Meanwhile... South Africa vaccinate non-Philly resident? notoriety supposed purpose life. think they're saving childrens' lives. kind stuff. requires everyone actually make effort get vaccinated May 1st. Sorry, what? TWO WEEKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! care someone getting sick chooses vaccinated. care newborn can't get vaccine able available infants (hopefully 2022). we're punishing people cannot vaccine either they're young medical reasons. mind child restaurant everyone vaccinated (I'd assume they'd give pass children like mask mandates enforced children) unvaccinated people no-go make sure child safe. mind staying home another year would nice able go public again. know longer I'm putting real website next hour. Yikes. Hopefully invalidate results lab. CDC director still claiming United States facing, quote, ""Impending doom.""

Yeah, saw get it. mean, one thing say ""it's soon drop mask social distance requirements, give another two months"". talk fourth surge impending doom makes sense. think ""passports"" like one implemented New York completely worthless. vaccinated, care people room vaccinated? 

Because kids vaccinated. OK. follow primaries since thought joke really pay much attention whatever saying back then. reference went head. Sorry. lick Knobs bro! Greece similar (adjusted population) ICU numbers much, much worse health system opening schools stores Monday. 

Europe absolutely, unequivocally screwed thing happened Northern VA Maryland. Nova ready open everyone isn‚Äôt 24 BMI MD getting 18-64 high risk.

VA mainly registration list whereas MD copied PAs hunter games virus amoral agent. care isolate, care congregate, searching bodies. vaccinated, necessarily find home you. wear mask it'll prevent transmitting others.

The virus care partying Spring Break extended indoor winter, looking bodies. masking getting people's faces, giving virus bodies leap to. 

The best step forward ensure mass vaccination also continue masks. Covid care feelings, responds preventative behavior. Watch twitter vid come blowtorching lmaooo God whole thing sucked ass theatre Sounds local health departments need get together uniform message. I've heard lamination ""COVID-19 Vaccination Passports"" now. US Trump administration would done different could. American look lens starts making sense. Well, half country vaccines is, yes... Finally, prevent COVID 144 Hz would‚Äôve funny like June 2020. it‚Äôs decidedly not. share one? it, right?

Bodies piling street, end days, right?

the TV people definitely never exaggerated this, right? think last two paragraphs already form perfect response first two. amount money someone correlate amount spend short term. Markets wildly irrational people wildly irrational, people wildly irrational wake this, spending money regardless overall financial health. I'm denying downfall inevitable, I'm stating revelry regardless rationality actions. question becomes, ""what comes ends?""

Stock buybacks absolutely explain market changes. [Stock buy backs 41% Q1-Q3 idea got idea from. also say Steve Mnuchin bought corporate debt. Mnuchin allowed companies take massive debts could forgiven long companies fire employees (in cases, got complicated obviously), Powell lowered interest rates ""printed money"" allow massive borrowing rates without long term consequences borrowers (or intended effect).

The end result businesses artificially stable cash flows work home class stable incomes nothing spend money on. work home class (let's assume 50th percentile income 98th percentile) makes exponentially stock market working class (32% vs. 0.7%), working class lost money, nothing bad happened stock market. Meanwhile, top 99.3% economy invest, whether businesses (the top 0.1-1%) retirement accounts (the top 50-2%). Obviously that's oversimplified, really nothing share repurchasing. Usa developing covid passports. things like movies may back soon wish companies would get memo collectively tell employees, ""Work home needed office. available on-site work as-needed basis."" 

They never due the, ""I paid dues,"" mentality decision-makers, should. pandemic exposed much people hate commuting office work. sub perfectly ok disinformation makes covid scary. crazy last Jan concept 19 people dying day virus seemed fucking absurd numbers seem fantastic. fucked year. 909. know typed ""few fewer"" extra ""few"" meant say ""far fewer"" latter, no. even rural areas guaranteed unlaminate stuff. trim edge sharp knife heat blow dryer get off. First shot Pfizer two days ago. Feel great. side effects. Makes feel better. got it! shortage either, unless saying literally everybody could call get vaccine, accept there's limit many people vaccinated per day. 

There might limit vaccines, limit vaccination slots. UK giving many slots possible first doses, leaving 12 weeks people get 2nd.  Death Stranding reference? School [socializing over-rated. 
Teachers tell students nonstop to, ‚Äústop socializing.‚Äù really get there‚Äôs forced relationships kids age, bullying, cliques, keeping high school teens perpetually children &amp; unprepared adult life. 

Parents missing free babysitting. honest. Modi government cares advertisements elections . Government‚Äôs need poor people . , don‚Äôt really care people happening entire pandemic. Thing happens like? definitely due politician company's actions. Thing happens like? inevitable act nature.

Anybody ever paid attention American politics public discourse surprised debate turned like every debate last decade. done first place:

Quarantine vulnerable populations let everyone else decide risk.

Florida v. California. stupid. Sounds kinda corny Staples laminating free 4/3. stores nationwide. got second shot Wednesday told explicitly laminate card able record potential boosters laminated. Yes like people can't get first doses people getting second doses. There's shortage vaccine here. get appointment within 2-3 hrs want. Bingo. politicization pandemic weird gross.

As I‚Äôve saying, conservatives made peaks pandemic way worse masking distancing. liberals clearly signaling they‚Äôre going push social end pandemic far away possible virtual signal ‚Äúdunk‚Äù conservatives bit longer, seen above.

This whole year turned hardcore centrist sees lot rot badness two party system. Alot European countries per capita almost every metric. currently ahead vaccines falling cases / death measures mean overall beat them. Big surprise get a...HELL YES! EU speed low literally cannot buy rn. Certain countries get praised reddit took privilege themselves, halt exports give damn dividing doses based population continent.

I guess morals go far... hate EU spat face literally trying right thing. vaccine-nationalism rise people getting 2nd doses US? slots could used allow people get first doses. That's UK doing. crowed Every teacher know, included, worked harder year ever. Many us teaching remote person kids - parents got choice whether remote person, teachers trying juggle both. Others change back forth teaching remote person, depending kids going for. district even teach remotely required 100% campus, except medical exemptions serious issues raise risk (we‚Äôre talking cancer patients, people asthma). taking home hours extra work every damn day. honestly think teachers sitting home PJs, ill informed. Lots folks get POTS viruses like EBV, CMV, HHV6. I‚Äôve years. Sorry happened you. It‚Äôs really difficult Obviously needs evidence medical authorities finally make call much less grounded reality claim don‚Äôt know anything vaccinated spread do. It‚Äôs frustrating annoying. COVID testing work. would interpret S/CO threshold positive result. automated systems use would same. test performed correctly, would indicate detection COVID antibodies. 

IgG peaks time you‚Äôre ill decreases months. would speak doctor determine need additional testing. US focused everyone getting everything. We're excluding people wait second doses. plenty everyone seems. experience got sinopharm case interested 

You‚Äôre welcome! brother moved Asia dated number girls wear hair coverings public noted made rather sexy first time saw without it. are: dating Covid era. Yeah, fair. Guess depends much delay might fast immunity declines first second doses, much bang get buck second dosing vulnerable people compared first dosing less vulnerable people (might also immunity dynamics involved). kinda idea would best event delays. Also want damn vaccine. I've heard current travel restrictions say simply ""don't travel"". source ""rules"" us please? thank you!! added both! impression we'd start see impact 60-70% population fully vaccinated? 30% adult population partially vaccinated good place be, 60-70% fully vaccinated. looks like 15-17% gotten 2 shots, also far 60% submission linking theweek.com automatically removed source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

It's COVID equivalent of, ""Abbott opened bars here, went. That's fault, mine."" fanciful ideas related government policies

I think compare countries better outcomes places like US, see fanciful government policies play big role. really genuinely enjoyed lockdown October. ran hard moments life go without friends. I've since become depressed desperate return normal. vaccinated. Someone would crazy judge you. true many people Israel refusing vaccines due religious reasons modi visit Muslim nations he's anti Muslim. visits, garner Muslim votes. Seriously!! Grow mate Thank trump that. Biden actually trying help country relatives sycophants. Mitch McConnell centrist Democrats roadblock now.  they‚Äôre still lockdown currently no? Populism I‚Äôd say go even better, frame job. needs chipped. don‚Äôt know numbers, see Israeli real world studies? Pfizer Moderna efficacy number reflects trials, I‚Äôve yet see solid conclusion regarding hospitalization death. Unfortunately think many ""experts"" opportunists looking get clicks/eyeballs/followers. write book.  Going grain dramatic predictions easy way achieve it. necessarily mean UK's vaccination strategy effective. Americans may socializing more, could explain drop deaths last two months significantly higher drop April June 2020. True. wish. Sorry, you‚Äôre going venture basement soon. Honestly, yeah, vaccines. like seeing falsehoods spread solely paint better picture. want people realistic. Making stuff bad matter side Ya nyc contract tracing app nobody uses don‚Äôt see becoming think large events mid July  Wearing mask much pain ass except running sports. continue wearing pure selfishness context Yeah mean reason we're kicking everyone's butt vaccination getting vaccines delivered country outside Israel UK. reason we're getting vaccines delivered signed contracts companies got us first dibs vaccines countries. contracts signed put place Trump administration.

Vaccine distribution throughout U.S. increased pretty darn linearly recent slow obvious Texas snowstorm slow down. certaainly point graph distribution say ""See, that's Biden took office things started changing.""

Basically, feds limited effects this. got number week Chicago absolute Hunger Games trying get appointment. Somehow dumb luck side. quick gag, think it'll go long enough use Facebook whatever. Maybe slightly longer electric fence prank jurassic park 1. Might early say looks like deaths US (7 day average) leveled (if scroll graph deaths check 7 day average box) Misleading headline - actually said boosters thought required, would aim occur September. possibility decide still. think it‚Äôs fully vaccinated (including 2 weeks post) negative text within x days. 

That said think it‚Äôs horrible hope become standard. Nice pivot  something worry about. People still vaccinated still getting sick. change anything. Fewer people susceptible getting sick vaccinated, otherwise remaining 80% still need vaccinated risk. 

Michigan's cases skyrocketing, hospitals getting filled up, like start pandemic, people make excuses normalize illness death. Yes. get whooping cough vaccine back went college never even heard before! colleges require covid vaccine. reading comprehension comes about

Really nailed landing pithy comeback ya?

I still want talk genocide please. Absolutely Well said. sub denial fact another lockdown much needed soon restrictions reinstated across many states. pandemic far over. think they're saying even vaccinated right now, still need wear mask distance people lie vaccinated. Meanwhile cousin 21 got company cause works Docklands ports security, reason need vaccine, fucking dumb. Deepti Gurdasani tweeted today something stages COVID detail followed tweet implying virus going select mutations evade vaccines completely vaccinate people. question like EFD Gurdasani alarmist nightmare scenario actually something happen? True man. True.

That said, dont understand ask is. pretend variant cant make things worse increase likelihood variant appearing? continue we've done last year, given us numbers we've got, decrease likelihood? 

The number hypotheticals worry infinite. 

It seems like variable actually control, meaningful impact, encourage vaccines fast possible. Everybody grandma seems going Hawaii right now. know people now. several families planning go next weeks.

Thing is, every one kind people say right things, talk like they're responsible. consider actual behavior pandemic, actually responsible, instead engage lot self-serving risky behavior (while making lot justifications it).  must've relief! weird way advocating restrictions covid, flu going around? I'm guessing not. world filled many diseases could kill someone day time. tried prevent every single death airborne diseases, we'd trying sun burns out. halt entire civilization extremely small percentage kids die disease. simply big threat statistical point view. Children 0 risk COVID.  

Oh cool simultaneously ignore dead kids know future free variants make COVID problem kids! Neat. Pretty much government documents ask laminate. social security card invalid laminate it, even something ever needs get updated. I've wondering happened anyone else! way carting around letter-size piece paper vaccine passport lol (my site also run normal size cards printing them). told *if* *might* able get normal size card second dose... holding breath. Gets shipped room temp Pringles Merkel kind problem Biden has: Local leaders following people facing pandemic fatigue. husband getting first shots tomorrow! üôå Probably gonna celebrate taking long-ass nap. months it‚Äôs known vaccines affect transmission. However, growing evidence vaccines prevent transmission. scary stuff think world live in, got deal reality it. guess means hunker more, keep physically anti-social, mask, avoid anti-maskers/anti-vaxxers literally ""The Plague""

side note: O.P. say one epic name, great song. Inspired much go put on. mean don‚Äôt know long vaccines effective enough data asymtomatic transmission.

Fair point former think we're kind point ""the vaccines massively reduce asymptomatic transmission"". See latter remark. adult, make decision what's best you. want J&amp;J, get J&amp;J. Meaning safe kids mix unvaccinated kids

Aren't *all* kids unvaccinated? missing something here, I'm certain there's child vaccine so, kids going mixing unvaccinated kids. Therefore, specify unvaccinated kids? Good news: apprehensive parents board getting vaccine, seeing sister (who also apprehensive first) get it. feel like leader family terms vaccine lol, saw got okay they‚Äôre comfortable it.

Bad(ish) news: (and sister) got Pfizer vaccine, they‚Äôre willing get Pfizer vaccine. bad(ish) seems like Pfizer dominant vaccine area, anyway. tried tell Moderna least good, they‚Äôre willing get shot didn‚Äôt get. Getting point already hard enough don‚Äôt wanna risk arguing further. 

I pre-registered hoping it‚Äôs Pfizer (which again, luckily seems dominant one here). says it‚Äôs possible. vaccines 100 percent. I‚Äôll take chance. recent Mayo Clinic study 39000 patients demonstrated dramatic reduction transmission 100 percent can't imagine absurd take comment. balk every time someone actually challenges real goal is. never replied me, outright stop replying anytime legitimately pressed issue. shows comment history. 

This sub full anti-maskers. case, comments stating ‚ÄúI got vaccinated today!‚Äù comprise 50% comments daily discussion threads wouldn‚Äôt literally universally upvoted. 

This sub full people complied mandates rules past year, people rushed get vaccine fully vaccinated, people want know hell stop this. people anti-maskers. 

Just someone threatened Covid mean blanket-name ‚Äúanti-maskers‚Äù‚ÄîI get rationalize away thought things moving towards normal faster you‚Äôd like, cope terms. Don‚Äôt equate morons burning masks right steps public buildings partying past year like nothing happened. 

There certainly people outright Covid deniers anti-maskers, like people wear masks years come (well guidance changed), won‚Äôt set foot public building 2021. 

And plenty people sit two extremes, people vaccinated asking questions. Stop calling vast majority sub anti maskers ‚ÄúCovid deniers‚Äù don‚Äôt believe exact things you. It‚Äôs completely baseless claim makes hard take seriously all. make app scans thru public social media profiles looks see somebody posted picture wearing mask grandma 75 struggled weeks get appointment. finally found one Friday 40 minutes away, seemingly ton available appointments. talked someone healthcare last week said we‚Äôre swimming vaccines PA. mostly agree. think things look different June. agree, however, need way phasing restrictions yet. would start process earnest probably around May, expect deaths actually fairly low, ""decreasing terribly high"". could come reality, nationwide vaccine passport USA would take literally years get there. country would socially economically fail get chance reach point. get it. going tulum random park close home. don‚Äôt know. let kids go maskless outside kids. adults vaxed gather Lives way important paperwork world.

The US already enough supply coming next two months vaccinate population twice over, AZ manufacturing issues bad can't meet contractual obligations EU UK.


AZ able supply anything meaningful US US enough supply every man, woman child inside borders. I'm sure fast approval would ANYTHING improve situation US. 48.4% 65 fully vaccinated, younger people seem hit harder, ICU even 90% capacity isn‚Äôt fine, it‚Äôs freaking madhouse requires tons optional overtime.

80 hour weeks full people multiple organ systems reduced function blows. tons patients think bipap mask pumping O2 what‚Äôs making hard breathe.

Doctors nurses got shat last two waves, everyone pretending like weren‚Äôt bad. freaking military surging hospital hospital year long keep ICU‚Äôs collapsing maybe great idea assume hospitals going fine. 

I know wife‚Äôs former hospital fucked there‚Äôs surge. dipped region least tried something, ICU physicians, far tired seeing parties drive home another bloody day. waited lull, man area screwed even get surge light. Oh well, circus, monkeys.  wallet sized though. much larger credit card. Lots talk ‚Äúcases!‚Äù young people... *by far* less likely elderly high-risk end hospital, ICU, dying.

A bump inevitable things reopen. Maintain hospital capacity ones need it, vaccinate fast possible. That‚Äôs it. ‚ÄúNo one ever get sick‚Äù isn‚Äôt reasonable goal expectation. ours. sealable badge/id holders work. makes sense. 10% population vaccinated meaningful, though help deaths massively.

90% population still risk, combined infectious variant, constitutes danger exceed earlier waves. Indeed, given natural immunity infection, likely England's third wave (seasonality notwithstanding) similar amount combined immunity, saw went.

The percentages really scale way suggesting. makes sense cautious confidently approaching critical mass, disease infectious. risk drops cliff eventually, immediately.

At rate, clear US anyway stated guidance that's important, fickle perception public. That's countries actually enforce policy, another kettle fish altogether. Shots give 100% coverage. told average protection percentage, specific protection based lab test immune system.

YOU risk others inoculated, too. saying wear masks visits. Everyone family vaccinated. Me, girlfriend, sister, parents, grandparents...everyone. I'll please. Sorry meant 35% adults, though guess 36+%.  Estimates many 35% population infected.  Obviously overlap, assume ~ 50+% population form immunity. We're really far 70% sort protection.  could literally happen within 30 days since close vaccinating 2M/day first dose rising. course correct, thinking HN/HCMC centric lens. Ylthis last year strange precautions always present also easy forget why. Hey youre got second shot 24 hours ago. initial symptoms worse shot two already mostly cleared 24 hours first shot dead 72  required already. clearly you‚Äôre wrong indicator predictor something.

the things list things predicted. argument made EVERY SINGLE TIME numbers come far EVERY SINGLE TIME there's another surge death. Clif415 accurate. FDA's presentation vaccine effectiveness specifically calls ""symptomatic COVID-19"". important distinction discussing disease spread symptoms. See 2:07 CDC's language less clear says vaccines effective preventing COVID-19, two bullets lower says ""COVID-19 vaccines help protect people vaccinated getting sick severely ill COVID-19 may also help protect people around them."". infers vaccinated person COVID spread asymptomatically. shit. passengers vaccinated - risk? aren‚Äôt vaccinated, test boarding give shot. shot isn‚Äôt protect cruise, it‚Äôs incentivize people wouldn‚Äôt normally get shots get one.

Apply concept air travel sporting events. doses newly administered

Is typo? Yes, absolutely. massively effective way getting tons young people vaccinated, vaccines already required. Mexico cannot afford so. everyone rich developed country. everything one gets COVID never goal.

It live. working great. basically live life like normal 95% time. requiring ID vote racist requiring ID go county fair totally fine. Got it. mean mandate vaccine want. shutting handful people can't get it. still Contagious majority vaccinated, that's simply shitty, tough, luck. advocating taking longer vaccinate anyone, think accelerated across board. worried increasing supply matter infrastructure give shots needs increased also, otherwise we‚Äôre gonna waiting longer need otherwise. Oxford vaccine safe efficacious based tens millions injections UK? yes, cares ‚Äúbad info‚Äù? no, let UK government know ASAP seem illusion vaccination efforts working. 

Lives way important paperwork world. sure yours. endemic 7+ billion people worldwide. *always* going risk scary variant emerging somewhere - forever. ‚Äúgetting with‚Äù vaccinating many people can. cause exercising heavy lifting. I'm walking around issues breathing pretty simple fill another card though. shocked see schools mandating vaccines entering student housing. Right. Restrictions likely persist beyond vaccine. People need expect get this. think P1 meant like Dr. Wen general sounds bit much mean makes sense. probably going honor system it.

3rd parties asking medical stuff BIG social taboo states I'm expecting lot people vaccinated refusing allow vaccine data accessed anyone else.

Hell, I'd think twice going place mandates can't wait get vaccine. That's part states vocal saying mandatory, political backlash did. lot venues/companies may use get stuff moving summer guarantee ditch asap.

As private gatherings, rules. one would check vaccination likely socially ostracized say require vaccine proof go private event. People choose death death, government take care citizenship types events; sadly, case many countries. mostly managed agree 'Covid-19 bad you'. 

But mostly. :p I‚Äôm 100 percent sure maybe assumption social visits may families without masks? schools kids wear masks desks Wtf everyone vaccinated it‚Äôs fine share small dinner them. hedging downvote? Whatever vaccine offered great vaccine!! Seems extremely misleading using percentages, number claims dropped 50%.

Say there‚Äôs 100 records 2019, 1 100 related depression.  2020 50 claims (and 1 50 related depression).  

That‚Äôd create 100% increase rate depression, actual number people depression stayed stable (just 1 case) rate went whole bunch people didn‚Äôt see doctor lump/cut/cough/weird rash.

So question whether people mental health issues also avoided doctors, way people weird rashes (so there‚Äôs really 2 cases depression 100 people, it‚Äôs half claims avoided).  it‚Äôs number steady terms presentation (e.g., you‚Äôd expect everyone broken leg claim - it‚Äôs something put off.)

It‚Äôs probably bit both. it‚Äôs misleading present raw numbers.  90% increase overall claim rates dropped half means *actual number self-harm claims lower 2019*. Fuck last year :-(

I hope things get better you. Masks cause breathing problems.  donations Seasonality. 100% Seasonality almost impossible get covid strictly outdoors Another holiday get without seeing relatives...score! ü•≥ seem understand world never needed stop, simply chose to. I'm saying done nothing, become obvious reaction taken life own, we're building variety complex social cultural norms around reaction, cornerstone technology.

Humans naturally socially distance. relentlessly commanded day technology. Covid plague, virus slightly reduces life expectancy - slightly. necessitate entire new technological world got us survive. That's choice governments made. there's good idea! goes Pfizer 

That assumption seems reasonable fully demonstrated. chose words purposely possible one dose Pfizer near good two doses. We'll soon enough good one shot long term, reason guess FDA approving approving something almost nothing actual safety efficacy

I speaking towards lack knowledge research current point speaking usefulness officially approved. FDA standards require researcher currently Oxford vaccine proven work beyond reasonable doubt UK it‚Äôs still FDA approved. They‚Äôre joke.

Oxford/AZ submitted bad info first time around cleared paper work yet. That's FDA, that's AZ. said another response - fair guys, assume you‚Äôre Americans living somewhere (as said) already started process opening.

I believe vaccinate population slowly opening proportionately. 10% vaccinated = 10% back normal. 50% vaccinated = 50% back normal, maybe that‚Äôs state doing, say process opening already started.

I live Ontario - we‚Äôve vaccinated 10% population it‚Äôs accelerating, we‚Äôre discussing another full lockdown. maybe see different perspectives change one views ‚Äúre-opening‚Äù plans. Yes, don‚Äôt let stop fearmongering I‚Äôm confused. high list booster than? haven‚Äôt prioritized anyone boosters still coming strategy still trying figure really need one I'm south central PA, signed Wellspan got appointment almost immediately. lot capacity apparently. even ask medical records, fully expected asked for. Doesn‚Äôt matter paid. Boris given us hope really don‚Äôt care countries. LOL, okay, good luck better say ""oh well, sucks them!"" instead mandating proven safe vaccine? articles also say nothing suggest vaccines significantly less effective variants. Interesting. sore lymph node week second dose, though opposite side got shot. 13.3% COVID cases children. die. zero risk less groups. cases matter? Surely hospitalisations deaths concern, especially amount people vaccinated now. Arizona, filled personal insurance info online needed driver's license prove identity residence (it county resident event, events need proof residency). that, hospitalizations also trending states cases increasing last couple weeks.  like clock work. manipulated data, aka Florida People noticed schtick dude. Thats all. get first dose tomorrow! healthy 21 year old male, Covid back February, still got call last week scheduling appointment tomorrow. Never excited pricked needle! may strong variants show ability evade antibody mediated infection

Some versions UK variant actually mutation. mentioned Israel's research Pfizer. So, mutation probably big concern seem think does. India also donated vaccines several countries. neighbor long covid, got vaccinated weeks back symptoms gone. trials vaccines finished another 5 7 years. happens voluntary cannot required.  What's going new wave infections caused variants transmissible also capable causing worse disease outcomes.  debatable anymore.  Large studies confirmed points. rise younger patients consequence this, also less older people coming hospitals hospitalized, states increasing cases seeing absolute increases younger patients hospitalized. worrying getting downvoted.

I'm going get vaccinated people still choice want something injected face ramifications make certain choice. Ethics people, ethics.... Morals morals regardless learn them. learn right thing Mr Rogers, freaking Smowpiercer. matter, long learn it. difference learn morals child show, sticks life. I'm sure pissed people impacted childhood show. vaccinating 2-3 million day USA. fantasy doom come true. kids going playgrounds months would hope it‚Äôs conceivable Children 0 risk COVID.

They lower risk (not 0) acute COVID, problem (same person said cares COVID spreads) still learning long term effects COVID. Even people mild asymptomatic cases may still end negative long term effects. Wearing mask closed spaces kids also get vaccinated minimal cost help mitigate unknown risk. Still better live staten island xD trash got go somewhere. Agree getting downvoted oblivion (the horror...) saying much. shit obvious going backfire bigtime.  Pretending lockdowns ""cases"" deaths/hospitalizations really going cause lot doubt heads normal Americans (not antivaxxer types far gone already). think series unfortunate events. 2020 year authority figures wanted act like Mr. Poe smfh possibly trap Well, far forward try project findings? believe airline travel may depressed 1-2 years, overall trend air travel last 30 years up, up, up.

 I've medically eligible several weeks today got appointment. know many people boat--legally approved list, unable book shot matter effort made. 

 nearly enough vaccine available already, expanding eligibility getting vast majority groups 1a 1b immunized make even harder so. hamstrings vunerable populations aims serve. always picture people outside beach, one least likely places get covid, instead group people sitting table eating inside?

People jealous beach places, swear... know airline industry works pricing. also know vast majority business travel go away never come back.

Well, random person internet KNOWS it, must definitely true. getting downvoted gotta say, similar thing occurred - I'm surprised black market yet. Looking vax card, would easy scan it, 'shop text, print blank. I'd thought would centralized database somewhere verify info card. point, businesses, employers, travel services, etc, going start requiring vaccine proof, well imagine antivax fools would pay fake card avoid getting shot. likely !. profits 2. produce distribute Pfizer need 2 things supplied UK. politicians fail point UK much vaccine manufacturing capacity. AZ worked companies around globe produce vaccines whole world unknown reasons factories based EU beset local yields. 

Everyone focused support AZ need increase yields. quite possibly held back negotiating price non-profit contract (buys less experienced plant time needed source cheap materials cheap plant) wont hear anything that. 95% refers contracting symptomatic Covid Hotel quarentine leaks. state successfully achieved eliminating transmission community time leak happened. What? spouting nonsense. say afraid room someone unmasked fully vaccinated.

What saying 30% people running around unmasked unvaccinated college campuses, they're going drive variants spread vulnerable people community. 

I care people, even anti-vaxxers vaccine hesitant.  UK signed ‚Äòbest efforts‚Äô contract day EU did. explain higher death rate UK variant then? Unlikely IgG pfizer around 10k AU/ml vs 450 AU/ml AZ first dose, previous covid infection goes ~1000 Az even close pfizer. much need immunity don‚Äòt know guess even low hundreds enough. tbh... even homeless ppl smartphones, even laptops! Dead serious. ones without smartphones 75+ crowd get confused myriad apps never use. High school biology Check dude middle shirt black pants.
Full underwear lol. Let‚Äôs see right decision. know things happening.... failure vaccines, failure ""protect elderly"" strategy. elderly vaccinated messaging says everything goes back normal. results dramatic increase spread unvaccinated age groups suffer. increased contagiousness mortality B.1.1.7 (possibly) P.1 play directly problem. 

The headline yesterday ""CFR rises young people Brazil"" anther example. CFR rose every unvaccinated age group Brazil, dropping vaccinated age groups. 

The U.S., U.K., Israel vaccinated quickly enough stay ahead problem. countries (India) seem it, clear (India much B.1.1.7 yet though). aside seems story everywhere: they've vaccinated enough people substantially reduce mortality, B.1.1.7 severe backfired lockdown hospital collapse anyway. You‚Äôre talking years eternity. Cant hit 80% without approved children. may never hit 80% hesitancy. 

Also, many believe it‚Äôs going endemic stay. case clear coast looking never happen. dont think heading post pandemic excess, dubious ever truky post pandemic. linger sure cause smaller outbreaks, esp since run anti vaxxer wall soon less people get booster shot. people going ptsd large crowds wile well would think variant automatically less deadly? getting information from? That's explicitly true.

Unless see numbers, seeing shit like percentage rise hospitalizations young people meaningless. 

I saw article number young people getting hospitalized Michigan peak winter again....at 25 day....25. state 10 million.

See number impact? mean goes without saying

Do people honestly believe pandemic people gonna sit couches still watch netflix?F*ck no! one,will definitely reduce staying home hours dramatically.I mean I‚Äôm even fine sleeping home 

The physical toll pandemic given people massive irreversible.Even though physical priority right now,mental health important.I personally literally half world right now,cannot cope anymore many regrets stuff.

So yeah,basically people gonna party like hell  Auto shows taken place Thanksgiving weekend decade plus I've convention industry. People manage. I‚Äôm sure many doses actually Chinese. First I‚Äôd like explain Serbia operates like Switzerland normal times. means caffes work masks. Here, life normal corona. Aside wear mask inside supermarket. Everywhere else actually worn.

Second, tests, Chinese vaccine considered ‚Äú safest‚Äù also takes long time develop antibodies.

Third, vaccination response could better, today people countries, even Albania, come Belgrade get jab, giving Astra Zenecca free. 

Fourth, 20% population doesn‚Äôt want get vaccinated, 2 students 100k came get free AZ shot university punkt.

Fifth, got vaccinated believed relax. undertone vaccines life completely resume. never stopped, Serb oppression close bar 21h. many people decided care masks distancing got infected. all, public transport people dont wear mask, do.

Sixth, suppose mRNA vaccines superior, got warned doctors mingle around need second shot, wait 2-3 weeks develop immunity ( took Pfizer).
Im sure really. Chinese vaccine isn‚Äôt bad per se, none people know bad sides it. regular vaccine like one ud get flu.
People general dont take chinese AZ. opt Pfizer Sputnik iirc. doubt colleges require August, sure Rutgers first said would, bet get several lawsuits due experimental still. appointments available Prescott Monday-Wednesday typing this. saying gonna wait one month cause end month, pandemic over, people gonna say wait another month. see city Brisbane going back lockdown 4 cases. low.... think epidemiologists actually want know way around. chances kid pass virus you, asymptomatically transmit unvaccinated friend colleague?

Does Israel's ""data"" show vaccination working well?, ""data"" show it!  potato, potato. simple misunderstanding point stands: allowed wear mask want Yeah lot people going care...

No. one hundred fifty thousand people die every day, irrespective COVID. People seem forgotten bizarre. nothing unnatural people dying virus. Nobody talking banning masks, they? agree actually. think CT best rollout region wish governor logical. special kind crayon eater get cruise ship right now. ""false data"", none countries ZERO cases stop spreading BS. Today's data shows Canada amount new cases Israel around 5000, however Canada 4x population less 25% Israel vaccination level.

Does Israel's ""data"" show vaccination working well?, ""data"" show it! still idea point was. ""just months"" idea related government policies due fallacies

**1)** politically convenient lot people act though COVID socioeconomic effects restrictions entirely controllable uncontrollable based government policy.

**2)** ""Overton Window"" COVID policy narrow absolute scale. Viruses care consider extreme mild restrictions. acted though California Florida complete opposite approaches COVID, perspective SARS-CoV-2, practically identical. couple effective strategies employed country prevented another enormous surge like saw NYC.

**a)** effectively spread message COVID existed try limit close social interactions, especially older.

**b)** got widespread compliance people going sick (yes, despite news reporting idiots did).

**c)** shut international travel severely limited travel within country cancelling business events.

**d)** allowed huge numbers people ditch daily commute crowded offices work home.

**e)** effectively shut *most* businesses create environment super spreader events.

Everything else, masks indoor dining closing schools shutting parks enacting curfews incremental effect. Even card-carrying liberals moving around restrictions. People meeting privately never masking so. Kids going frequent playdates. Adding restrictions one area meant people compensated another cases, ultimately actual functional difference Florida California spread SARS-CoV-2 fairly minimal **a-e** lion's share work fixed factors like climate population density throwing big wrenches equation.

We would relatively ""extreme"" approach change things substantially. Lockdowns would intense could exponentially decrease case counts tiny numbers, America March/April would gargantuan task. Then, testing contact tracing would robust effectively catch every case spreads. far actual enacted policies basically call Florida California same, despite seemed like polar opposite approaches way presented. Congratulations. learned government restrictions accomplish anything.  Who‚Äôs talking banning masks? completely misread lol Point Reddit racism well taken India‚Äôs exports don‚Äôt amount much terms ‚Äúrescuing world virus‚Äù yet.

Except masks everything back normal, guess masks necessary long now. people avoiding vaccines identify convince get vaccinated already studies. I‚Äôm saying none mentioned left leaning groups. think point people think everything getting better people getting vaccinated, however age groups havent heavily vaccinated numbers bad literally one vaccinated. 

People would assume older population vsccinated would lower infections everyone since still large portion population longer spreading it. Also younger age groups still fair amount population vaccinated. Medical, high risk, people right place right time/know someone etc.

So keep hearing lag know likely materialize way previous waves. vaccinated. family almost nothing close contact, everyone household lock protect one person early 60s hasn‚Äôt chance vaccinated yet? think found Amazon PR rep... already fully dosed actually. 2 3 weeks, double it. years months. follow science CDC. 40%+ another issue entirely. 
Re ""Also, many believe it‚Äôs going endemic stay. case clear coast looking never happen.""
With attitude, nothing worth struggling possible. 

50 days ago almost zero vaccinated. 120,000,000 shots given. availability getting better better achieve heard immunity quickly. 

Dont downer man. read might horniest summer ever, possible baby boom next spring. logic anybody doesnt fall lockstep actually unrealistic goals like zero Covid whatsoever worldwide automatically anti-masker? feeling simply removing formality one following anyway.  Still though, really sends wrong message exactly ""divulged"" - form provided directly central office school nurse, HIPAA requirements applicable locations avoid disclosure personal health information. Vaccine status *not* disclosed students' families general public.  

I'm involved pro-vaccine advocacy need close religious philosophical loopholes, think covid vaccine required public school enrollment time soon. Let guess, jackass singing horrible song. taken vaccines indeed young

Not including Palestinians ages right? It‚Äôs everyone left anti everything crowd Getting vax lol Respected public? Yes.

Listened Bojo bullshitter? much. COVID vaccine trials done petri dish environment like cruise, least it'll offer scientists interesting data. Wow. mom immune compromised won‚Äôt even get vaccine protect her? Bet cries every day shit kid gave birth to. think Trump supporting masks, fact goalposts changed almost weekly, two groups people: One group thinks it‚Äôs right assess risk safety wear one not, group thinks there‚Äôs point, we‚Äôll forever, unless pull cord. want badly Covid worse is. that? slap prop 65 warning it. Nah Trumps administration like 1984. media said so. law background becomes law guess would way it‚Äôs always enforced. They‚Äôll collect evidence build case go them. ie use wedding photos determine guests match list vaccinated list. headlines written journalists profit sensationalism.
Nothing spectacular. AZ vaccine good vaccine. likely ppl dying refused take it. contribute high quality information *that conforms beliefs general narrative. Differing opinions allowed.* Fixed today It‚Äôs relief see vaccine programme succeeding. wasn‚Äôt long ago ‚Äúplague island‚Äù seeing nearly two thousand day die. can‚Äôt wait bit get vaccinated too. Good demand might end outpacing supply means everyone hasn‚Äôt eligible yet keep waiting longer thought. It‚Äôs ‚Äúscary‚Äù shitty. areas taken virus seriously trouble getting shots areas not, sucks. what? Getting vaccinated going beyond jobs lmao long term effects covid well known horrific.

If work hospital ashamed yourself. say that? 

New painkillers always developed released.

It serious question, prescribed buying new medicine check marketing authorisation granted many patients given it?

If vaccine different?  Yes  Triple being... everyone? 

I think fair say least 1/3 covid though covid vax cures cancer, got it! Fuck man Massachusetts going like too. really need hit gym again, god damnit reminded one time received ebay package pudding/baby food cup, none-padded hot pink birthday themed polybag... Good lord Really dosent matter, gonna happen again. China dosent give shit countries people.    Nah, people actually support way Biden handling this. projecting feelings saying failing inspire confidence. quite opposite, confidence public health efforts rebounded Biden. 

There loud minority kicking screaming everything needs go back normal immediately 20% population shot. people support continuing restrictions people vaccinated. 

Chill out, get shot, wait others get theirs. enjoy summer.  50% efficacy Brazil. Turkey think 80%. think maybe Brazil variant reason low figure there. passport even permanent thing. COVID longer threat, I'd give couple years businesses longer care. Whoops ‚ò∫Ô∏è something also expecting, people long called weeks ago: year pretty much limit most. already approved vaccines. People get vaccines go work settled law.

Why focus getting vaccines formally approved using existing requirements already place drive compliance. Pfizer stated going seek formal approval next month. get approval people going get forced take vaccine employers. Michigan getting wrecked right now. everywhere:

 - home 20:00-04:00
 - Restaurants takeaway

Lol would state step tell private businesses operate? really think become giant risk privacy later on? vaccine passports public sentiment reduce amount data give big tech, sudden people trust them? really sore arm first night. Could sleep it. Pain went away within couple days though. can't get rid point without essentially destroying economy mental health citizens. better vaccinate many move back normal, sustainable. That's also works US. Lab Corp offering quantitative titer test ordered doc you‚Äôre sort thing (I def am). 

I‚Äôm going check mine ongoing start recommending boosters, determine even need one. thing husband myself. go hiking weekends get true alone time ways enjoy. maybe expired vaccines...
dont expect much hope 50% effective rate... know sounds insensitive maybe is? kids getting sick isn‚Äôt problem either. newborn? Maybe stay home. everyone else stay inside? Israel Denmark requiring go bars, restaurants, concerts, etc. first report said likely came lab. Every one else following contradicted it. Think China may threatened workers there? would guess. source that? every source find say opposite US need point? guess backup  think made official strategy, think Oxford vaccine longer time shots Darwinism work, much Orwell. 
 
These people engaging groupthink, taught disregard reality challenges beliefs feelings. - today: ""**more young people hospitalized requiring hospitalization ending Intensive Care Units**. worry variants concern would spread quickly dangerous younger patients, appears case Saskatchewan right now. **Younger patients getting sick easily severely recent weeks**."" article posted earlier may read: **""among ages 30-39, 2,030 Brazilians died COVID-19 far month, double number reported January**."" people going business virus exist. That's exactly prompted make statement. actually taking precautions statement you, part shouldve pretty easy understand. Yes, J&amp;J limited availability US couple weeks. ICU curves already rising. somebody chooses get vaccinated later dies virus that‚Äôs them. need given choice. Yeah, one articles today study even mentions recent study (reported last 2 weeks) showed 94% symptomatic cases. Ok, USA similar rate vaccination shortly. 30% entire US population least 1 dose, compared 50% UK adults least one dose. 

If talking full vaccinations USA people fully vaccinated UK. UK 7% adults fully vaccinated compared USA 20% age 18-65 50% age 65+. 

Simply put, variants major impact USA.  That's normal Look answer questions yourself. aren‚Äôt personal researchers school U.S. lately? Let answer you: haven't, they're locked tighter Fort fucking Knox. 

If least kid school, received the...I hesitate call pamphlet, literally size novel...hundreds pages protocols, rules, regulations order open safely.

So whole idea ""just protect teachers back normal since kids fine"" connected reality situation.  School districts *very, much* concerned making sure kids get infected. looks like 80% two weeks. 

I think study Israel shows 72% 30 days. 

There's study showing AZ Àú75% 90 days, think there's equivalent study Pfizer/Moderna. ask source NOVA ready open everyone? seen indication that. think even moving 1C still possibly couple weeks away. feel way Covid measles? We've never vaccine passport measles, around 10 percent population never gets vaccinated it. 

We need vaccine passports majority population get vaccinated community spread drop near zero levels. Getting last ten percent requires giving level privacy never get back. spoilers: doesnt. province, like 3 cases fulminant coagulation disorder thrombopenia young women astrazeneca (Thrombosis brain pulmonary embolism paired low plateletts). vaccinated aprox 25.000-30.000 people az. God knows many women age 18-55. sake argument lets say recipients women 18-55. severy life threatining side effect probability 1:10.000 realy acceptable covid-incidence 100:100.000? 50% 50% virtue signaling Then...all get vaccinated and....do that? Yeah still massively lower older age groups. Look talk young people hospitalized Michigan, scary sounding percentage that, look numbers, corresponds single digit daily increase hospital admissions.

It's like young people suddenly filling hospitals. Hospilization still exceedingly rare age group. Ah yes, UK famous never opted EU policies caring lot whether criticised that, totally forget part! Almost forgot UK part Schengen euro area. replying wrong person :P Regarding first point posit lower number deaths make okay. Even one death one death many opinion. said, admit freely absolutely everything possible prevent death deaths regardless occur. mean make effort.  


At point claim ok. asked society going crazy trying prevent that. Drug poisoning awful risk society. control spreading (literally) like wildfire.  example, people die every year many kinds colds forth. society mandate wear masks time? socially distancing measure take response pandemic something time moving forward preventative measure?  
 *Public Health England estimated 2017/18 flu season, around* [*22,000 deaths associated flu one highest flu death tolls recent years.*  


So yes quite lot people dying seasonal flu England, absolutely measures place. guess what, do. vaccine rolled annually. little play song Agadoo done NHS Trust Blackpool urging people get jab. need social distancing ""colds forth"" we've got ability fight it. recently weapons national unity giving shit people. vaccine people get vaccinated see measures understand go away.  let's take second point, agency individual tied direct result harm. know driving dangerous results many accidents deaths every year. mandate every car built computer chip knows cars location speed limit speed vhehichle speed limit whatever road car currently driving on? require every car built breathalyzer? require every police officers gun fingerprint sensor someone can't grab use unexpectedly? could require every individual eat healthy exercise try maintain healthy weight. list goes things could prevent death, choose do.  


Deaths roads terrible, deaths previously established. know road deaths UK around 2,000 last year. nearly level deaths Coronavirus UK 1 day lets ignore example still credibility.  


But point mandate every car computer chips blah blah well currently.  


\- Seatbelts mandatory 
\- Speed limits 
\- Drink driving laws 
\- Drug driving laws 
\- License drive vehicle 
\- Speed Cameras 
\- Speed humps 
\- Education children crossing roads 
\- Child seats 
\- Regulation child seats used 
\- Regulation age children stop using child seats 
\- Laws people using devices whilst driving 
\- Providing bus passes fewer elderly drivers 
\- Helmet laws motorcyclists 


Just things mitigate road deaths. let's say speed limits face masks seatbelts lockdowns. They're tough like government saying can't drive all, risk unnecessary deaths reasonable things. drive 100mph (wear mask) school zone (whilst supermarket).  


It's reasonable response problem. can't blanket apply rules everything unfortunately. 10 people drown year sea 80,000 people die smoking, reaction same.  


So original point, country go lockdown contagious disease killing vulnerable people high rate? may say yes, might say asking take similar response current drug poisonings? one person would likely provide reasonable argument. States countries lockdown basically outcome did. masks, closed business, loss freedom, rise suicides, drug ODs nothing. No. can't. said sub?

It‚Äôs question people dumb, it‚Äôs question intentions speech. say whatever hateful ignorant misinformation want spew, can‚Äôt say something purposefully harms others. 

Personally constitutionally, think more/better information best way counter bad information. think give credence bigots idiots ‚Äúsilence‚Äù force. 

**it must true! Otherwise wouldn‚Äôt trying silence them!** /s exactly saying. Stop ignorant, whether intentionally otherwise. It‚Äôs vaccine diplomacy all. It‚Äôs way contracts written. ordered vaccines get US ban exports enough citizens. that‚Äôs case, ban lifted company follow contracts. 

The US vaccines. allowing exported yet. Yes, Random Reddit person, I'm sure worldly expertise much valuable fucking director CDC.

This stupid argument keep reading. Anyone access data see what's going on. There's need expert tell me. That's fine. way around. Check people Florida trying enter states. said mostly using Chinese Sinovac vaccine. interesting see effective proves be. highly doubt Europe still lockdowns then. Summer last year restrictions vaccinated September. Sounds like good time! Hope fun it. think instantaneous, biology work way. day get shot US. 
Where news that? Pretty sure Floridians WANT vaccine passports, south panhandle anyway. pretty clear intentionally missing what's said. message consistently we're almost woods, stop taking meds early feel good.

100% people saying saying intention pure ignorance. Lil Vir know. I'm healthy 26 year old got second dose month ago. Alabama let get mine fairly early I'm education. hated feeling jumping line, say opportunity reared head.  Yup. trump administration got vaccine pushed public pretty quick. Biden team done good job keeping exceeding roll out. get back normal point summer. cutting corners delaying second doses proven save lives. UK reason LOL, hilariously bad example make point.. still 95% protected, cast 10 foot sphere protection, making everyone within 10' 65% protected. unbelievable public figures probably slews PR folks, consultants, etc helping pandemic communication messaging still bad.

They pitching ""get vaccine ASAP protect push society closer herd immunity, wear mask meantime slow spread, behind us summer time."" Instead treating us like children fear mongering. rocket science figure type message going better encourage people part. military require becomes fully approved FDA

Smallpox actually contagious COVID (R0 4-6, COVID estimated around 3-4). But, like COVID-19, highly effective vaccines able eliminate it. 

Eliminating COVID insanely easy. takes people taking damn vaccine. apparently country set expectations accomplish *so low* even idea getting 80-90% population vaccinated seen ""impossible"" many. Real World data show vaccines good preventing infections. Science stuck january data. Straight page linked, apparently bother read:

Given tardiness EU signing deal AZ include ""best efforts"" clause rather commit set volumes set dates. EU wanted time schedule UK, signed deal spring instead months later late summer give AZ sufficient time build supply chain produce vaccine. 

AZ exported around 1m total vaccines UK since started, Pfizer exported 18m+.

Is so? least Norway lets private! provinces illegal open private.

There around 1500 orthopedic surgeons one example can't work province cap surgeries doctors prohibited opening private surgical clinics.

I looked Norway sovereign wealth fund (which understanding guys got idea us Alberta, guys followed sadly).

I heard rumour Norway eliminate taxes wealth fund full interest alone enough fund public spending? wonder migrating Norway hard! Okay, we've lockdown well 6 months. go get medical treatment travel history check done. stupid enough go one spring break locations taxpayer dollars insurance money spent making better. Including long term issues. report almost nothing vaccine passports though. anything, solidifies idea vaccinated useful, extent makes little sense vaccinated people barred visiting countries. vaccine emergency approval. 

This means companies make held liable something goes wrong. like big pharma ever fined billions dollars criminal acts, right guys?! Like you, really want get traveling, double-vaxxed means good go. 

Who‚Äôs say can‚Äôt travel you‚Äôre already job? went Florida last year week job nine months, questions asked. wanna go somewhere new job starts, go it, don‚Äôt feel rushed, especially you‚Äôre traveling internationally. lot planning go it; usually year out.

If you‚Äôre looking places go, hear many Eastern European countries open right now. weird kind ""shaming"" regional localized. Even liberal progressive California counties like Shasta OC half ppl mask public one really cares. SF LA ppl walk around avoid masked. Sounds like they‚Äôre trying place? 1. Vaccine 
2. Mask

That‚Äôs correct order it‚Äôs issue isn‚Äôt order pushed public health messaging right  Yeah, interesting, heard viable solutions going forward different UK government already planned out. expect type real world data Johnson Johnson? That‚Äôs one got! told get first one available! government stop zombies x zombie series, well know. No, not. telling must make *feeeeeel* safe, selfish. Grow up. Learn manage risk. specific mutations behind reduction antibody effectiveness (like E484K) prevalent parts country, like NY many times surges occur great majority age 65+ vaccinated?  Conservatives tend label everything ‚Äúsocialism‚Äù (including original post) see think that‚Äôs socialism. it‚Äôs not. Except I'm not, that's viruses work--they evolve ""forever"" equally deadly versions themselves. virus us foreseeable future, shocked see covid-19 boosters become regular part seasonal life, like flu shots. However, viruses generally evolve a) less deadly b) better spreaders. current variants better spreaders original, they're deadlier original, reasonable expect long-term future variants crop places continued high spread better spreading worse killing. 

The thing I'm advocating approach gets us back normal life minimal risk quickly possible. Opening everything (in UK, specifically) pretending like one day deaths means everything fine irresponsible, also unscientific likely make things worse long run. Taking precautions made massive difference. shocking country Europe able handle situation without vaccine, came much sooner expected. next time might lucky. ease single shot cannot understated well, many people can't take time two shots, especially side effects mean two days work pay 

Then get one shot moderna pfizer....as STILL higher efficacy J&amp;J, right? Trump right defend WHO. Dumbass Biden wants back Israel‚Äôs top doctor already saying many restrictions need remain place foreseeable future kids aren‚Äôt vaccinated.

So pretty much know goalposts getting moved *again* US, probably May June. 

Then kids vaccinated, we‚Äôll still wearing masks distancing ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt know winter look like‚Äù.

At certain point, people need put foot down. Yes, becomes lot harder terrified entire family bubbles vaccinated.

I‚Äôve listening Dr. Osterholm‚Äôs podcast, epidemiologists mostly concerned enough people vaccinated yet. Yet states opening super fast even removing mask mandates. 

1) enough people vaccinated guarantee public immunity

2) States removing COVID mitigation measures.

3) B117 variant starting take foothold US.

Sorry, civil liberties these? We're speaking UK context specifically here. feel though civil liberties impacted lockdown limiting order avoid infection anyway. view ""being able go pub"" civil liberty. 

80% achievable, variants kept away long vaccination rate (which excellent UK) keeps projected pace. I'd hope see cases low time summer full swing rate we're going--this seems like much better outcome opening early triggering another year this? showed two-dose regimen either vaccine, Pfizer Moderna, prevented 90 per cent infections two weeks people received second dose. vaccines prevented 80 per cent infections two weeks people received first dose, study also revealed. findings underscored protection individual experiences infection second dose vaccine, also first does. conservatives lying make liberals look worse need help with.

California let happen too? Also, hundreds thousands deaths medical treatments 100% effective they're obviously not. 

The countries states people always use examples handling covid well much smaller populations, islands much easily isolate rest world freedoms (i.e. China). Also many countries Asia experience SARS better prepared acted quickly contain virus. 

And record, believe federal government dropped ball handling covid early pandemic clearly prepared. January 2020 late contain [the CDC believes virus already spreading US January It‚Äôs opinion Covid never eradicated buddy Correct. nearly extinct States, that's pretty sure thing.

But yeah, thing collecting huge amounts data (you know will, prevent future outbreaks course need know times) Oh yeas can. Stop propagating false information. People get flu time vaccines maybe 50% effective. meaning 50% chance getting flu getting shot. 

Same COVID vaccine. 1st two \~ 95% effective. meaning still 5% change infected even though shots. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then consider new variant's seemingly popping daily done testing determine existing vaccines effective those. Thank you! business owners free say, vax, service. showing store vax exactly you‚Äôre saying ‚Äúforcing others put something body enjoy life want‚Äù. Cases matter lot one 70% US adults vaccinated... sick enough get tested, probably infectious. Fully aware, stop virus. pointed type, isn‚Äôt going anywhere. stop world tracks forever, viruses risk live with. 

Cases go forever, can‚Äôt live ‚Äúwell could mutate‚Äù state mind forever. 

BTW, I‚Äôm wearing ask type this, I‚Äôve shots threw non mask wearing person shop 20mins ago. believe it‚Äôs real, believe it‚Äôs bad case count isn‚Äôt worried about. healthcare system stable uptick open point. Exactly! People want restrictions end actual introverts.

I'm introvert party animal, many people calim introverts equate introvert boring shut clue. Introversion tendency like smaller groups socially need sometimes ""lone time"" thats it. mean hating around people. hospitalization numbers come down, they‚Äôll stop going up. Yeah, we‚Äôre going see 80s 90s level crime decade. weren‚Äôt around you‚Äôre going see crazy get people nothing lose. Call 119 go website book there. work. Get soon April slowdown What‚Äôs point, then? concerns United States reaching herd immunity. Maybe. bars Dallas Friday Saturday weekend one gave shit. two bartenders bartenders servers saw weekend wearing masks bars completely packed. wouldn‚Äôt surprised we‚Äôll half going already Covid though. friend group it‚Äôs 70% us. Call 119 ask book in, use website. work lot states recently opening eligibility everybody, there's LOT people waiting get vaccinated couldn't. Tried everything: seeing friends, going bars restaurants, shaking hands, hugging family, etc, etc. 

Just can‚Äôt quite seem it. 

Antibodies that. Don‚Äôt follow science? gonna keep repeating myself. vast majority travelers responsible. millions people traveling every single day, airports back normal, months. part Mexico obviously seeing outliers, much like Florida recently. I'm sorry makes angry, maybe data justifies anger, know really care. tangent really interested in. care people imposing fear-based perspective onto others, shaming going lives, especially responsible manner, like person originally started thread said doing. Save ire people blatantly refusing wear masks acting disrespectfully countries patronizing. me, OP. one fully approved FDA illegal sue turns long term side effects. consider different? I'm still getting vaccine subreddit's obsession forcing experimental medical procedure hundreds millions people terrifying. Cuomo said anything getting rid masks increasing full capacity. replacing testing requirements go venues reduced capacity. said venue using could go 100 need masks social distancing would ok it. can't find J&amp;J i'm at!  one hand, understand skip 2020 (or switch virtual-only) want skip 2021 well, helped. also country vaccinated November July (or August? whenever Comic-Con usually takes place)

On hand... Thanksgiving, really? one holidays everybody get work (sorry retail bros) spend time family. nothing, many vendors exhibitors (the peeps movie studios, streaming platforms oh yeah, *actual comics publishers*) want spend family holiday rubbing elbows thousand comics nerds? put ton money them? everyone get vaccinated been; COVID rare.

God knows vaccine optional. Plus, people 16 vaccinated mass another year most. still variants there, may aware them. COVID becomes deadly, circumvents vaccine, what? develop boosters.

You cross bridge come it. faith vaccine developers jobs, spent enough time worrying I'm carrying energy depending upon vaccine gotten, may may still able transmit it.

I've got J&amp;J part trial, vaccinated almost 4 months careful. 

Thanks concern, barely leave house plan traveling state another months. 

You work medical field understand think way do, say me, I'm talking fear (""the variants!"" ""But still spread it!""). rush burn masks found vaccinated I'll probably wearing public rest year since actually like wearing masks!  That‚Äôs Jesus would Palm Sunday. /s Big edit: think people deserve die second turn 60? think 38 year old family friend literally prior health issues deserved die?

The fact can‚Äôt argument half million people dying disease, number GREATLY reduced social distancing measures could us back lives far earlier ended up, without assuming it‚Äôs due person ‚Äúscared‚Äù insane. Either think 500,000 people dying lot don‚Äôt. again, nonsense took topic(business owners right check vaccinations don‚Äôt want people carrying covid businesses)to somewhere never was, ‚Äúis covid bad‚Äù. Fuck argument. Fuck argument. entire scientific community agrees horrific deadly disease. Whatever bad faith bullshit respond with, whatever helps sleep night. also means bringing UV inside body somehow effective treatment got COVID. Yep government acting like kids... Give inch take mile.. number one... think whatever want I'm completely clear this.

For number two usually several years people tracked two years based safety well longer-term efficacy established least determining efficacy would longer period time.

Number three... know first states mandating vaccines college student attend person classes 16 17 would one choice Pfizer. answer no... schools would basically stay online every student got whatever approved vaccine was. likely would use masks interim said regard taking trips, I'm split.

On one hand, new experiences amazing, ability get plane bop around world less month's pay remarkable. climate change horizon, doubt remain case whole lifetimes. Traveling long distances leisure retirement probably thing us unless get green infrastructure ground way faster rate we're currently going (and countries). words, get can. corners world amazing sights see.

On hand, alluded before, climate change problematic maybe bad thing people flying around world constantly. may day view things like frivolous displays carelessness environment. kids tomorrow probably make memes millennials virtue signal much care environment social media snapping pics international vacation.

With everything know travel effect environment, one could make credible argument taking international vacations today less morally bankrupt ditching mask subway small, common COVID transgressions add big effect.

This comment bummer, though. can't save world own. answers hanging around reddit much.  saw article citing immunocompromised people need everyone keep distancing masking. I'm wondering people covid? Run around rubbing people? meaning contagious

Okay fine, ""impending doom?"" Impending doom meteor headed straight house. CDC using hyperbole like that. hope people least think children avoid spitting others‚Äô mouths much possible. getting closer closer 7 day rolling average 3,000,000. absolutely awesome.  

Both parents get first dose today. Okay fun safe, totally untested, mRNA gene therapy. Oh sorry, meant vaccine. 

Pretty funny definition vaccine changed include mRNA ""vaccines."" entire discussion taking away older people. 

To extent freely available older people younger people, course that. Nobody saying otherwise. CDC politicians finally acknowledge tell vaccinated people need religiously follow masking social distancing guidelines?

They aren‚Äôt going to. Vaccines reduce likelihood you‚Äôll infectious, don‚Äôt guarantee it. you‚Äôll way knowing whether you‚Äôre infectious time, like anyone else wouldn‚Äôt. 

Mask mandates like going based community whole virus. help community better getting vaccinated, restrictions aren‚Äôt going catered personally based vaccination status. No, yet Impending doom?

Complete nonsense. 

Hospitalizations plummeted like 75% since started rolling vaccines. declining like 2% day.

The country Europe similar US respect vaccines UK. 0 deaths handful people ICU.

These fear mongering headlines stop. literally helping anyone.

For anyone interested hospitalizations/icu: totally get point think I'm ready that. lose friend something trivial wanting eat outside instead inside I'm sure friend begin lmfao TWO WEEKS AGO CDC issued guidance ""3 feet fine instead 6 feet.""

NOW, ""impending doom.""

This textbook case destroy one's credibility. Thanks detailed reply. probably get vaccine one point near future end year probably, still worried bit. antivaxx, worried longterm sideeffects brand-new vaccine. *Laughs Pennsylvania* friends angry boundaries pandemic, they‚Äôre friends worth having. DUde, stores showing record profits 2019 early 2020. afford pay better? That‚Äôs nearsighted greed. You, sir, bright. Could both. wish CDC would post projections instead making like we‚Äôre doomed. Yeah highly doubt it. literally came CDC MMWR. We're year into, ""The sooner follow guidelines, sooner return normal.""

Is really crazy think people longer believe that? last time state tried enforce covid restrictions Mac's, manager ran sheriff's deputy car got scot-free. least way, can't operate. That's true kinds things - flu car accidents. honestly, without actual statistics dangers suggest risk way disproportionate acceptable societal risks associated things like flu car accidents, impact analysis all. Makes easy blame feds/big pharma rather state/govenor still can't get shot. actually make ziploc ones. That‚Äôs kind ordered. sealable. Yup thanks reminding me. People 40 likely die car crash COVID last year. dont see nation shutting (much dangerous) thing!

Stop killing train conversation. Go back polio ebola answer question, youve moved something less deadly (yet somehow still worse covid...). Almost like COVID isnt real pandemic! actually CDC?

Oh fuck shit. makes want openly stop complying. Last year politically acceptable fine outside, is.

This place r/politics massive overlap, severely damages objective thought. One thing could done might moved needle - used defense production act ramp N95 production sufficient supply entire US population. instead everyone using cloth masks 30 - 50% efficient, universal early adoption N95 levels adopted cloth masks could pounded COVID ground. change technology, behavior. mean, clearly political decision Canada throw shade AZ vaccine Brexit. Canada known agent EU Commission. native English speaker? use term ‚Äúbald face lie‚Äù 

Given fact can't even spell word correctly, think yet another arrogant, derisive troll gambit going disagreeing someone validity news source make ‚Äúbald faced liar,‚Äù

You literally called doctor listed first name, last name, face well hospital works ""anonymous"" source. lie grotesque gross enough is. try slither way scandalously pathological lie debunked literally 2 5 seconds clicking news article, switching BS ""random doctor"", demonstrably said. ultimately start lying way lied well. double down, triple quadruple down. beyond disgusting Youre either native English speaker

And yet another grammar/spelling error. asking question know already looked now? asking rhetorical questions? think score points lecturing language absolutely *nothing* go on, writing like semi-literate? embarrassing thoroughly exposed first read French article didn‚Äôt see doctors name scanned it

You lied, pointed lied, doubled, tripled quadrupled down. addition, ridiculed credibility source without knowing first thing country, publication, journalistic method general. Plus, dwell several hardcore disinformationist subreddits, Reddit banned ten times already. bad faith actor every imaginable way. Like calling five year old writes sidewalk chalk driveway vandal level dramatic.

This sentence missing punctuation, ironic.

What need time away internet. need deprogramming disinformation spend day parroting. that, going need help become functioning, clear-thinking member society again. even within means mental bandwidth, there's even dignified society left ilk done it. much visible public due pandemic, they're likely able secure funding technology proven widespread real-world usage. that‚Äôs message you‚Äôre hearing, you‚Äôre ducking idiot.

Get vaccine, wear mask, sooner later life get back normal.

Be ignorant Asshole later sooner vaccine 100% preventing infection, chicken pox kid vaccinated mild didn‚Äôt affect long term. exactly covid vaccines do. Even slight chance catch covid vaccinated, likelihood severe illness close zero could hope for. Low-dead-space syringe production really needs shot arm. Yeah, mean believe delaying gain 10% additional protection tops, want risk don't. make uncomfortable lack guidance really jamming us terms summer activities, lot normal providers stuff like camps etc. seem opting offering stuff year.

School ends little two months, couple places offering stuff day full mile-long waiting lists. idea much matters efficacy (given dosage pfizer .3ml could be) certainly waste add terms waste efficiency. I‚Äôve saying past year. convincing fearful people case = death, making thing last longer needs to. YES end making people cautious good, also young healthy people won‚Äôt leave homes terrified getting COVID dying. should‚Äôve always staying inside vulnerable don‚Äôt die, save you‚Äôre healthy person. good biomedical science sector strong university research probably also helps. UK *a lot* vaccine trials, probably tied contracts. Yeah, guess I'll cancel then. Thanks! Eh. watch major drops neutralizing antibody titers, we‚Äôre still seeing strong responses Wuhan patients year out, I‚Äôm worrying waning protection much yet. Clinical trials progress. one ETA probably look timeline adults starting point. J&amp;J seems like best case Africa. logistics getting people two shots enormous places. drunk driving laws? Hey thanks response, I‚Äôll probably opt towards J&amp;J vaccine it‚Äôs around area since I‚Äôm 1) high-risk individual/ rush get vaccine, especially since I‚Äôve already covid 2) don‚Äôt want even remotely risk long-term effects mnra tech, even risk incredibly small I'm pretty risk-averse honestly. Lost 5 people far I've basically cut world. guess cancel make plans weeks. like people want restrictions end. challenged too. biggest concern daughter potential increased risk Parkinson‚Äôs line. increased rates Spanish flu, it‚Äôs suspected (but obviously confirmed) previously covid increase risk lone also, due similar inflammation. people sensory issues wear glasses deaf, miserable. me, much, people there. vaccine rushed long term studies. They‚Äôve already hurt lot people. many cases women losing pregnancies vaccine people half face shut down. probably already covid (my father sister it, fine week) didn‚Äôt feel anything, data suggests I‚Äôd totally fine got covid. 

Of course, don‚Äôt know long term effects, one (that‚Äôs point). many 22 year olds gotten even sick covid ? Probably less 1% got it. gonna take vaccine that? Nope 

I‚Äôd rather go danger know, doesn‚Äôt amount much (losing sense taste couple months? Big deal), danger don‚Äôt (a new type vaccine rushed ‚Äúsuper trustworthy‚Äù big pharma companies) *vaccine* seat belt, mask. 

And think risk high public even after, you. vaccines quite effective. 60 vaccinated, 27.3 16 rest probably vaccine hesitancy (a large portion level immunity due infection).

Israel basically entirely vaccinated point. No, study huge. Firstly, one first real-world US studies, second, population getting tested COVID often, meaning asymptomatic cases logged well.

The original trials *only* looked symptomatic cases. That's efficacy data written like ""95% effective stopping symptomatic COVID-19"". trials great proved vaccines keep people safe, address stopped spread (after all, maybe ton vaccinated people got it, asymptomatic never tested, potentially still spreading it). led huge narrative, specifically among antivax vaccine-hesitant, vaccines worth it, stop spread. course, anyone basic science education could safely assume also stopped asymptomatic, never data back up, companies studies said could.

This tears narrative apart, shows fully yes, vaccines work, stopping symptoms, stopping spread too.

This study justify end mask mandates restrictions, convince many get vaccinated. huge. may lose friend zero chance anything happens weeks Vaccine injections.

Not single vaccine ever developed side effects 6 weeks after. Neither anyone million already vaccinated screened checked upon.

That's based way vaccines work. 

Current mRNA based vaccines nothing ingredients consisting Covid-19 pieces. body takes good look it, processes cellular matter poof, vaccine gone. never escapes muscles injection site. old style live-virus vaccinations.

Plus current mRNA new. clinical studies mRNA injections 2018 already. Meaning developed researched years beforehand. took process applied vaccines.

You can't compare medication often times synthesized (bio-)chemical factories get processed intestines, liver kidneys turn create degradation products like. Unforeseen side effects happen way way later time, although also highly unusual. pretty tough. understand, kids low transmission rates kids. possibility adult child transmission. likely let play kids handled vaccinated adults. That's risk level ok accept, enough information. new information I'm willing revise guidance. projecting awful lot onto eight words... thankfully vaccines effective. We've gotten lot older people want them. isnt taking away. need focused spread exposed hospitalized able rapidly move federal supply communities complement state supply. point it‚Äôs longer utmost importance. could done December, probably could saved tens thousands lives, we‚Äôre going General population states next two weeks, finish started. Vaccine hesitancy, vaccine apathy, antivax campaigns next major hurdle. year ago people cursing China refusing say pandemic warning others

this year cursing officials telling 'em truth warning them.

the vaccine protect person body &amp; immune system enough time generate protection.

Sadly going find nasty variants first hand USA. forget even pitfully small amount sequencing we've discovered home grown variants concern California &amp; New York watching ones Oregon &amp; AZ agree. You‚Äôre almost OP let know you‚Äôd comfortable 2 weeks vaccine full power. u need better excuse say ur feeling side effects second dose Ty explanation, idea lol, agreed people enough money live $1000 month disability benefits/family assistance. need turn personal attack.

hoo boy wait rub faces morons know of. Duh duh duhhhhhhhh. Spooookyyyyy. sentiments exactly. needs stop we‚Äôre doomed talk. stands, we‚Äôre averaging 2.76M shots day going increase get supply states vaccinate general pop. 

Based current averages, we‚Äôre expected 60% adults one shot end April, 80% adults one shot end May. might get faster hit 3M shots day April. 


Israel 7 day Average equivalent 22K cases us that‚Äôs falling hard. 50% pop fully vaccinated, could us end May per capita wise, trail Israel 64 days. message, 2 months away returning normal, we‚Äôre hearing talk like it‚Äôs winter surge.


According Worldometers, 7 day average 61k rise cases last week. beginning March 69k day. slight hiccup along way down. two weeks general pop able get vaccinated cases plummet.

At point messaging one positivity, careful two months most. 90 percent reduction transmission enough change behavior modify policy? owe Doctor friend apology wisecracks make job consisting ""take two aspirin call morning."" So, guess July 4th picnics off?

For real though, common theme administrations facing pandemic sugar coating stretching optimism breaking point. *this* felt like talking public space, imagine *horrific* data seen is. someone sitting bottom eligibility list NY, beyond excited see this.

I fully vaccinated healthcare worker planning vacation soon-to-be fully vaccinated partner another country requires PCR testing stay. know many colleagues something similar next weeks months year really difficult us desperate need break. believe proper mask wearing, hand washing, etc fully vaccinated pretty much negligible risk transmitting virus others. think point we're going make decisions risk balance continue lives way reasonable yet still remaining conscious others. responsible think eliminating risk entirely, rather aware risks everything mitigate reasonable degree. think depends hospital/surgery registered with.

I'm fully vaccinated now, would mean need sort booster shot November? logic abolish laws people follow them. people vaccinated weren‚Äôt ones spreading part. Well make harder convince parents get vaccinated Absolutely - Ireland Commonwealth, based need. Getting elderly at-risk done first makes sense. 
 

At point, desperately risk vaccinated, I'd favor free-for-all, book every person wants approach. even ""Oz's"" approach. Australian states taken approach overreacting small number cases like New Zealand has.

New South Wales maintained policy aggressive suppression need live small amount community spread. well results complete elimination. NSW done three times.

[This offers good tips based focus group. TLDR politicize it, focus science. Emphasize vaccine studies 60k+ people showing safe. Almost doctors choose get it. truthful know everything vaccines, know covid lethal, know prevent covid. knew whoever replaced would worse. unironically believe masks zero burden, need realize opinion norm. never said vaccinate. earth get idea. 
The point vulnerable largely vaccinated, 3+ million vaccines/day, risks Covid much lower year 2020. 
Vaccines good. get vaccines flu year too. Nobody saying stop vaccinating.  Mom's workplace 269 site workers, deemed High risk given chance take AZ shot site vaccinations. 269, 10 signed up. Come vaccination day, 8 willing take it. yeah, many unwilling take AZ shot. Sub *Temporarily hold age group unspecified safety reasons* point risk death still low. exact point seeing increased severity disease across cohorts (well, least 30), hospitalizations cohorts increasing absolute numbers, percentage overall cases since older cohorts higher rate vaccination.  Whether meets threshold concern point. sense yes massive amounts. Similar take flu test strep test Thought European conspiracy? Holy shit. 80% two weeks first dose. Studied time variants thing. Let‚Äôs go! None vaccine apps track people check in. 

Bottom line: want life return full normal soon possible. vaccine hesitant way. can‚Äôt get R 1 people refuse get vaccinated, I‚Äôm fully board passport allows rest us live lives normally. benefit stick don‚Äôt get vaccinated DON‚ÄôT need passport CAN‚ÄôT get vaccinated immune compromised leave homes. sweet irony Barnard Castle certainly lost decide get vaccine still wear mask deserve insults hurled you. Anyone acting like truly selfish honestly ashamed themselves. real danger know LOSE immune response delaying Moderna Pfizer second dose, right? 
I agree principle guy ""no durr"" look data said put one shot many arms possible, chance losing efficacy second shot made go proposition. seems like really good news. live Netherlands mix Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca, Johnson others. hope work good going full Pfizer. got first shot Moderna. Still don‚Äôt feel anything hours. I'm assuming mostly younger people (under 50 crowd) vaccinated yet know trolling not. lie

We vaccine cards passports deal this. day get scientific proof Moderna Pfizer effectively reduce transmission. Fucking unbelievable What's deal Walensky today? I've feeling pretty hopeful, first time year. whole past year really messed psyche mental health, think things beginning get better, light end tunnel, director CDC getting teary eyed, talking impending doom, feelings dread. great way rain somebody's parade, know is, know much take it. truly bad, need completely honest. If, overall, things like vaccinations trending right direction, light end tunnel, we've heard over, celebrate help people get across finish line. know can't one feeling like, doubt dramatic, negative outlook, ""if we've begun rolling 2.5+ million vaccines per day, what's point even trying. Let's eat drink, tomorrow die."" 6 weeks Israel Care elaborate? honestly think feasible US ask millions follow rules?

Even California seen large Covid surge despite restrictive country. Combining study 4000 health workers showed even 2 weeks first jab Pfizer Moderna may 80% protected simply outstanding. limited supply ordering early supply clearly difference U.K. Europe.

No difference countries happy import vaccines export them. UK smug great supply chain much want. reality invested much production locally (like like claim) import huge amounts.

You harping pause vaccine available small number ""delay"" pause negated day two usage vaccine resumed. whole EU got around 18 million doses AZ vaccine point. less 900k per country. wonder media gonna use news headline ‚Äúx child died Covid‚Äù ‚Äúy child got long haul symptoms‚Äù convince people 2022 protect kids. really definitive policies place country yet.

Source? I'm sub daily never heard single instance this. 

What get people feel long term effects this. training body fight specific virus. tech development several decades, apparently 22 year old reddit knows experts worldwide spent entire lives field. 

I'll stick medical experts telling everyone take thing ASAP. rest world used basic common sense same. Guess hard cautious. sure agree.

I'm sure anyone say certainty vaccine given many doses given Vs rare clots are.
have really ruled everything else? like UK rollout going okay. NC seemed get rough start lots confusion get vaccine when. First responders seemed taken care job fashion vs vaccination center. people chronic issues eligible they've gotten system lot efficient clearer. still problems automated online process (i.e. response forms) work around them.

Bottom line people finally getting shots timely speedy manner. Calling ""selfish"" going convince get vaccinated. Neither ushering dystopian government programs.

Give incentive get vaccinated, they'll it. British Columbia government says glory holds ok. Mine handwritten issue anti-drug messaging. ""Don't smoke marijuana get addicted ruin life."" smoke weed, realize works, leads people think whatever drugs without potential hesitation. sudden heroin addict. ‚Äúimpending doom‚Äù tad dramatic? can‚Äôt imagine we‚Äôd see winter level surge. EU terrible containment. disagree America First Vaccine plan obliged companies fullfill US orders first equals export ban? never claimed things said did, said US forbade companies exporting vaccine fullfilled US-orders vaccine flows UK US EU way around. Thats said. said nothing disprove except ""This false"" whole bunch unrelated stuff. No, technically summer starts June 22nd, less end Q2, hence possible achieve. Either way, trajectory we've told past weeks rosey, getting doses delivered somehow evaporates time needed vaccinate people. lucky get enough doses produced July vaccinate 70% people, count least 6-8 weeks additionally deliver (this assumes scalability number administrations per day become problem way that) Drunk driving laws nothing this. Driving privilege get licensed for.

Going public, people house, rights. tell limit gathers, cannot mayor overnight decide need mask.

I wore mask year. year. data. COVID isnt deadly mainstream USA. took mask weekends ago staying off. far people dont seem care, 1 place lost business. accept new normal. reclaim rights prior exaggerated shitshow. Thanks! I'm fine people disagreeing things downvoting without saying useless. GSK vaccine plant Canada already! producing anything COVID-related moment. missed yesterday! Glad you‚Äôre back  precisely arguing here?

All People matter age health need vaccinated. soon humanly possible. Especially vulnerable people old, sick, poor ones access basics PPE, testing, medical institutions, medicine. 

What precisely problem here? saying people age 65 Africa vaccinated? 40 year olds countries important ones African nations? 

What precisely problem? Can't speak everyone, lot Southern states hospitalization levels currently seen since mid April.  CDC information released today would great data point bring up: could show 90% effective real-world, non-clinical studies. Helps bolster argument. Seeing things work real world examples tends help. plenty point, going wrong locations difficult need get. end April, glut supply everywhere government begging people.

As soon Astrazeneca approved, supply issues completely over. wrong like, every point make? think France sequencing capacity thing. yes Tom hanks mullet owner 3 corporations trench coat? getting numbers moderna 94% US trials J&amp;J 72%  It‚Äôs still much full lockdown.

Some measures lifted slightly. doesn‚Äôt change fact we‚Äôre still crippled lockdown justification. Yep, Ohio we've hit 70% older adults, bet there's another 10-20% would get vaccine, need able walk get one. wrote numerous emails district senators Gov Inslee. single reply... That's I'm talking about! Keep going! beat thing. EU ordered enough e.g. even earlier UK AZ. difference EU include Europe first clauses contracts, force European developers cooperation contracts European companies enact export ban. Oh administrative issue? Must ""privilege"" working me. agreement African Union, 55 member countries, yes, distributed among them. one reason, much EU also much less stringent lockdowns, can't lock borders, etc. I've working developing country years Carte Jaune since started. think ton people US traveled countries require it, seems alien. Thank you! Everyone talking double masking I've wearing 3 months now, I'm thinking stepping 4 soon, since yet. governor moron. Ironically actually think Washington really good job early yelling states enough we're end game figuring get normality quickly possible without massively sacrificing safety main thing. Frankly think almost entire US point now. couple exceptions New York New Jersey Michigan riddled variants going take probably another month states get there. Well wife got dragged back office. part happier working home. Especially drive work. spent 22B, they've given budget 22B spent 7B.

It work one best world, although rocky start. 

It expensive build testing infrastructure scratch use pre existing infrastructure like Germany could. talking *Kontaktverfolgung* (testing contact persons via PCR testing) started working flawlessly February 2020 without federal intervention first wave municipal public health authorities systems place started NHS wait end May government enact somewhat similar system. contact tracing contact persons work really well second wave anymore obviously. single company, 15% Africa lot. Considering JNJ also deliver US EU Florida Must Lock ... Must Flatten Curve . . . I‚Äôm going honest say fucking hope don‚Äôt need yearly booster. I‚Äôve flu shots far worst shot I‚Äôve ever second dose.

I massive fever, serious chills aching, day long migraine.

I‚Äôll get boosters, won‚Äôt happy it.

I really hope somehow eradicate disease. Okay, agree theory. think tough measures you‚Äôre suggesting would necessary worthwhile would similar NZ/AU approach (possibly limited) border closures, rapid response local lockdown expedited vaccine development rollout. sound right?

(FWIW, sceptical effectiveness lockdowns compared options, gunning attack here, trying understand side.) comment actually part problem though since perpetuates idea mask wearing virtue signaling. 

The fact basic public health measure, mask wearing, became politicised contributed pandemic. certainly correct people use wearing mask make political statement, also correct people opposite either. 

By participating culture war, people enabling it. ""right side history"", we're together. aren‚Äôt hurting anyone didn‚Äôt choose enter business. people little bitches asked wear masks?

As teacher, giving lectures simultaneously online person year, bad. Anyone info variants / active Israel? Yes exactly, FEMA site, friend 17 years old worked K-12, parent him, get denied vaccine K-12 ‚Äú50+‚Äù showing Secretary Human Health‚Äôs directive, agreed eligible, said won‚Äôt vaccinate anyone 18+ (they offered Pfizer) 16+ vaccine. told employment wasn‚Äôt good enough would need Doctors note. work federal site; doesn‚Äôt mean know law understanding vaccine work prevent future possible reinfection, anything existing case. asking heard that. long rant sounds like something made up. doctor apologize I've heard enough medical opinions redditors now. work real estate industry. companies moving hybrid arrangements permanent/indefinite remote work relatively rare. say bucks, Pam, that's ladylike think first line. site largely bots people whos job downvote certain things sway public opinion. 

The first line, isolation, seems suggest number cases / ICU occupation 'not lot' either tricked algorithms people. 

Anyone who's posted enough knows certain things get downvoted LOT soon they're posted (within seconds/minutes) ratio switched upvotes human users actually read comments Mexico holding scapula. I've joked eventually we'd get ""vaccination causes zombies"" message fringe, never thought I'd actually see it. are. Federal government charge procuring vaccine getting country handed provincial governments. provincial governments charge distributing local health units across province. health unit charge setting vaccine clinic locations qualifying/priority groups it‚Äôs open to. I‚Äôm sure provinces Ontario, vaccine started rolling start March 80+ age bracket, health unit come sign-up system. provincial government finally got asses launched province-wide sign-up system. Many local hospitals also sign-up systems addition health unit-run vaccine clinic sites. already unfilled appointments? thought Canada super short vaccines? federal government found **Americans prefer vaccination** pharmacies expensive mega-sites.

the next big problem country COMPLACENCY.

&amp;#x200B;

in Jan - gung ho vax.

today.. 45% city 1 shot.

it's way less urgent (to me, now).

I jazzed going across town. (and eligible week)... 

It's CARE pharmacy vs convention center.

it's convention center means vax trip takes 90 mins round trip

if public library - ""commute"" disappears.

there's also 2 public school yards use (the kids aren't) 

because we're last 20-30% second doses.. 

the big barrier HASSLE.. second shot keep getting put off.

unless get toothpaste, loaf bread, dry cleaning, vaccine.. they're less likely make special vax trip.. needs turned ""errand... ""

&amp;#x200B;

I suspect throughput would took 25 vax stations split up.. say public libraries. school yards. people zip walk up.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

when state makes ""everybody"" eligible they're starting do, put centers ""everywhere""

&amp;#x200B;

we go mega voting sites Even so, Chicago way better Philly. Chicago 14.5% fully vaccinated. Philly 11.0%. That's 32% vaccines administered per capita Philly. Probably helps UK isolated rest EU now. Weird, isn‚Äôt We're far herd immunity hardly anyone vaccinated. Israel, vaccinated vast majority entire population Pfizer, seems reached herd immunity already. watch see breaks new vaccine needed. It‚Äôll work well contact tracing, don‚Äôt worry.  wasn‚Äôt crazy laugh-inducing idea even 10 20 years ago everyone seems lost shit willingness believe people good people, too. 

I‚Äôm opposed vaccine passport think whole concept ‚Äúshow papers‚Äù completely messed up. 

I‚Äôm stoked fully vaccinated. stoked prove every turn. *are* disaster movie. entire thing felt like something Outbreak shit.

For me, mass vaccination site comfort: scenes like end movie tell over. know vaccines work even currently infected? may asymptomatic showing symptoms? like task failed successfully? would true except look every single country around get mutations 

This true every virus. Coronaviruses mutate slower most. others vaccines modified account mutations. exact level mutation risk another note, many asymptomatic covid victims lifelong repercussions, neurological issues, etc... ignoring doing. young (which get neurological issues regularly) cases persistent medical issues rest lives. nightmare health care system USA, families compelled take care them. 

The virus going away. again, level acceptable? think overstating horrible is. life. sucks new endemic virus around is. Damn 90% cases thought 50% new cases either way mRNA vaccines effective UK variant. sad thing one going listen him. People jumped directly back lives now, god help vaccinated yet. job OVERLY cautious instead cautious lot people misinterpret mean he's authoritarian. No, don‚Äôt need shit. indeed good news. Brazil SA variant get foothold foreseeable future news even better. work every ward every hospital London, ED work in, pretty much back normal days. Even working red side (department split, red=covid, green=normal), rare see actual one. Mostly people pyrexia sources, COPD people struggling breathe.... COPD. Normal patients ED.

Still right take precautions though. Ziploc bag! 
Protects card. Allows easy inspection/modification. Costs roughly $0.01  official guidance CDC wait 10 days positive test result 48 hours stop showing symptoms getting vaccinated, think that's infecting people vaccine site vaccine effective COVID-positive people.

The exception COVID positive *and* received antibody therapy, point definitely need wait 90 days getting vaccinated. exponential decline show down. Ignoring temporal issues point out, R~0.95 UK compared 0.7 earlier. think confusing highest % distributed doses allocation instead per capita. understood. thank you! state (New Mexico) released tracing app last week. older lady shout mask around chin eating popsicle. 

Guess was? Sitting outdoor table restaurant. Yes.
They believe number artificially inflated get money EU.
They think even non covid deaths put covid statistics. Oslo Accords PA full responsibility health-care Palestinians. Israel wanted give PA vaccines purchased PA refused. Instead negotiated purchase (I think Russia).

Meanwhile Israel began vaccinating Palestinians work Israel anyway. sure many, though. Damn it, wicker man fire now. Maybe month early wont fuck spring...

Seriously? Australian city 3 day lockdown. objectively better approach UK's 'here's another 3.5 months already done 1 month 3.5 month year?' whole damned country? Functioning track trace, elimination decisive early action.

Whether even strawman not, comparison two different approaches two otherwise relatively similar countries. One would argue better approach every sense. absolutely fucked UK. week vaccine deliveries really start ramping up. Can‚Äôt wait see April numbers end looking like. dont jinx it! showing symptoms think may exposed yes, get tested. reason believe COVID directly exposed fine get vaccine. GG England, still waiting France.. EU delayed tried pinch pennies...during pandemic. like trying make quick buck EU, reality things faster larger scales takes money. Thanks explanation. meanwhile see number daily death. change minds? believe fake facts too? think underhyped pro J&amp;J able follow CDC recommendations fully vaccinated people (no masks visiting fully vaccinated people, etc.) month earlier.

But can't go wrong either. 40% so. There‚Äôs requirement participate vaccine passport program condition getting shot, though. Get shot, keep like personal medical decision, live life normal. I'm talking long term point we're going call quote unquote endemic pandemic. also lot concerns long term well particular reduction number people get boosters. That's probably single biggest concern US read article day specifically this. talking decreased transmission rates warmer temperatures. safe, rates would decrease significantly. Ill try find article link get back work. [play stupid games] 

[win stupid prizes] 
... 
""Double nothing!"" Symptoms went away 8 hours hell negative Covid deaths? People coming back life? don‚Äôt think vaccines effective mate first shot yesterday asked tested positive COVID shown symptoms past 2 weeks. assume fine. think pandemic totally sometime June

It going much longer summer -- nowhere near scale. still dangerous. 

It still worldwide pandemic variants continue cause issues years, even boosters developed delays getting distributed (not bad initial delays) people fine getting initial jab may less enthused getting new one every 6 months even every two years.  

There still pockets around world, travel still spread parts world protected particular variant. 

There LOT still know COVID-19, mutations, transmissions, immunity. took lot digging around google understand this. Side effects long term, vary rate cases, extraordinarily rare know side effect within 2 weeks.

Also think live virus vaccines gave vaccines general little bit bad wrap. tech behind vaccines general, particularly mRNA vaccines, amazing/different. Capone convicted crime committed.

Just get enough evidence charge crimes mean commit tax fraud. 

Your comment makes realize police absolutely dig deeper find criminal activities bar owner committing. DC part state though, unlike Staten Island, lacking representation. way would apples apple comparison would Staten Island secedes NYC NYS. 
 
Staten Island impotently threaten leave city every years, realizing they're economically dependent blue parts city hate would shooting foot pretty hard. gonna name daughter vaxzervia Basically virus enough room mutate, like flu. So, example, Pfizer vaccine developed February last year present, we're still well far herd immunity. means virus continue split strain Pfizer vaccine tested with. 

Also, various vaccines provide varying types immunity. really well prevent infection getting point person needs hospitalized. So, example, J&amp;J vaccine ~70% effectiveness infection South African variant (though near 100% effective hospitalization) still leaves room possibility virus spread people vaccinated. Shhh tell blue checkmark sure yet probably federal housing plus things Texas second highest positivity rate country. NY NJ Michigan populations mass metropolitan areas. Houston ant comparison NYC, Detroit. Population density problem. texas rural, still highest numbers country. Infected, new infections etc... Also takes two+ weeks infections turn hospitalizations typically surge infections/positivity rate. seen us 3 times already dozens times countries, uniform. 


I arguing republican/democrat thing, neither. guess constitutionalist parties betrayed hundreds thousands times year, parties far concerned go screw themselves. Governors sides acting foolish, people pay price. Mark words, Texas, Florida, states relaxing restrictions going really rough soon. hope wrong, science says otherwise. science Fact, speculation like governors ""hoping"" ok. 7 day rolling average 6000 cases past 2 weeks. New hospitalizations past 2 weeks around 16 states. see.

So, curiousity - large category people think permanent eviction protections? Alternatively,

California: ""90%+ vaccinated COVID transmission basically nill. enough? Let's abundance caution bit longer..."" Ye virus rather similar humans likes take weekend off. hope others follow route vaccinations, waves keep coming awhile 22bn budget, actually spent. never wrong Truck Drivin' song stuck head! spitballing, lot white women stay home moms nothing get radicalized facebook. See thing retirees. would career depended it. get don‚Äôt tell anyone got ah yes, great American standard ""trusting others right thing"" Same, got Amazon throw away gave skin rash/burn, clearly something it. Always tempting say darwinism work situations, reality end hurting people take science seriously. ohh matter infected covid get vaccine? may asymptomatic showing symptoms? sorry I'm making sure. Thank you! seem invested topic, —Ç–æ–≤–∞ÃÅ—Ä–∏—â. really substance article, something like criticise report for. there's *huge* difference administration caught tapes repeatedly downplaying denying effects pandemic supposed authoritarian plot results in...less people dying? pandemic means Good lord man, let people enjoy things. sound immature taking stuff personally anyone could liking things childhood. CDC would Congress President Biden sort thing ban evictions least large category people. Since happening year precedent  Uk also getting nothinG Moderna see jumping queue berating pharma companies everything undermine vaccine confidence. challenge saying, rather open question I'm curious hear peoples' opinions on... acceptable level deaths per day Covid? 100? 200? Obviously 1000 unacceptably high (that shakes 365K per year huge), get hundred dozen, green light resume regular life? think CDC going permanently ban evictions? choice virtue signaling way helps spread virus virtue signaling something combat it, I'd certainly likely accept latter. right politicizing masks though; fact became ""difference opinions"" still feels like combination contrarianism hatred even mildly uncomfortable. Yes, even published data it. 100% preventing spread close it. Pfizer though. Executives charged personally committed crime. fact, due level privilege responsibility, automatic maximum sentence fines based percentage net worth gross income. fine. would require test anyone gets vaccine issue. Thank you. I'm gonna stick J&amp;J. Yup, healthy 27 yo health conditions put risk. Cases continue go vaccinate enough people reach herd immunity like Israel did. mean vaccines work, means vaccinated enough people yet isn't, regarded deliberately insulting term used certain hostile groups, British Overseas Territory. Tenho medo por que como Brasil virou um caldeir√£o de novas variantes, os outros pa√≠ses podem doar ou negociar vacinas para impedir surgimento de novas variantes, ou se fechar completamente pro Brasil e fingir que n√£o √© com eles covid better spreading, 'more airborne,"" people less immunity tend produce droplets.  


Also, people getting tested flu.  


More reading means virus airborne companies biggest expenses office space astronomical prices nyc

Seems like low hanging fruit save money Agreed. asked question friend seems using fact god COVID three months ago excuse drag feet vaccine.

We're also Texas everyone eligible, appointments available CVS, taking anyone wants it. People telling Moderna based efficacy, numbers apples apples. Moderna Pfizer tested without variants time cases decreasing US. J&amp;J ""battle tested"" trials happened variants active second wave increasing US abroad. 

If healthy 27 year old around people lot risk, take J&amp;J. efficacy rate protecting serious illness others, tested variants, one shot. fine. get mutations ie: variants mass amounts people getting virus asymptomatic. large body people virus increases chances mutate. madness going Florida likely spawn variants. variants might escape current vaccines have. people ignore distancing guidelines, masking etc... irregardless age perfect situation virus mutate. 


On another note, many asymptomatic covid victims lifelong repercussions, neurological issues, etc... ignoring doing. young (which get neurological issues regularly) cases persistent medical issues rest lives. nightmare health care system USA, families compelled take care them.  


Fine vaccinated, variant comes ignores vaccine, health experts afraid of, expecting numbers infections increases. larger pool infected, infected (reinfection happens regularly) higher chances mutations possibility mutation leading deadly, transmissible, vaccine evading variants increases constantly numbers increase.  


These events EXACTLY virus needs evolve something worse. start again, since vaccines wont work. already barely work South African Brazilian variants, minimal effect transmissibility. turning major players US. Look Michigan atm, SA Brazilian variants. Uk variant covered vaccines (thankfully) original novel coronavirus, others vaccines effective on. 


Either know Science, cant add 2+ 2 simple... City people pandemic practically house arrest. Suburban rural people going nature walks bike rides. 

The inconveniences city life simply worth anymore. People put could live close high paying job. people need close work used to, space, privacy, clean air, quiet streets going important. 

 upcoming decade going see huge transfer wealth urban communities, similar saw 50s 60s. I‚Äôm sitting waiting area vaccine center now! healthy 21 year old male, show it‚Äôs becoming widely available now. Never excited get pricked needle! Aside first link highly prestigious (lol) news site euronews.com interviewing anonymous doctor France quoted saying vague statement along lines ‚ÄúI‚Äôm seeing younger people sicker,‚Äù absolutely none sources say younger people hospitalized worse condition previous waves well allegedly responding well treatments.  Duhh  question anyone's choice. responded saying ""one done"". safe assume meant say advantage, since that's always talked about. responded asked clarification. simple discussion, need attach malicious motives it. many reasons JnJ definitely preferable mRNA

You mean *some* people might prefer it. Saying definitely preferable general statement. Ofcourse, ideally every non conservative government would undo damage previous Conservative government. realize much damage Conservative government much work rebuild destroy?

Building things takes way work political capital knocking Lib NDP government tries immediately undo something Cons did, they'll painted wasteful inefficient. think wholly unfair blame non conservatives lot able fix every mess Conservatives made. made claim, either defend it, remain silent. 

Stop wasting people's time. 28% israelis 16. bought refrigerator 20 years ago salesman tried sell stainless steel model - looks nicer, easier cleaner, scratch, etc. asked downsides. ""Magnets stick it."" Lol, GTFO. Hard pass. Longer lasting + robust immunity. Vaccine + prior infection basically slams door reinfection asymptomatic spread Well..have got news you! Yeah, agree. everyone gets vax wants one, I'm done masking social distancing. We're measures prevent asymptomatic spread vulnerable people. vax turns tables puts decision risk hands. sure downvoted.

Because (i) unrealistic (ii) relies bizarre (but understandable) risk analysis.

If saying ""every American"" - well, know vaccine even approved 18. Hopefully soon, unclear.

On risk point, virus simply dangerous 40. I'm going travel go gym leave house every year flu season risk might possibly, maybe cause 25 year old catch flu die - I'm going COVID.

For 65 - get it. COVID really, really bad. they've able get shots point. I'm putting life hold 22 year olds can't math understand basic risk analysis. Ah yes total number ‚Äúpeaks‚Äù 12M. Amazing reporting, definitely struggling fucking clicks. That's brutal.

Didn't animal challenge trials still detect virus mouth throat saliva? would get better protection taking Pfizer going second shot. evidence outdoor spread extraordinarily low all.

If sat shoulder-to-shoulder thousand people hours, making other, maybe might little worried... kind normal hang situation? all. [Norway isn‚Äôt Look next comment 1 minute later. Here, show this. wrote it.

That makes dangerous time, since March last year. west coast. lol. legit posted 1 min Cuomos tweet. hell 7 wholesome awards? award's intended purpose. last weekend first max vax sites opened near impossible get one St Louis. friends driven state get doses (I think Cuba MO farthest). Though really seems like floodgates started open last week saw huge amount people locally twitter well remainder friends get vaccinated.

I work medical research luckily got mine first wave back end January, help others know get scheduled somewhere within reasonable driving distance. sooner. We'll eclipse 12% total population received *first* dose week.

People vaccinated week told second dose scheduled 4 months (this Toronto). 2nd dose take resistance ~60% ~90%+.

Just look ""100% effective severe disease"" crowd. People can't handle things, let alone different update frequencies different vaccines, effectiveness depending strains, time previous immune status.

Really broad vaccines bit reach still, even easiest testing organized West anymore. No. can‚Äôt actually read data come conclusion. data collected December 2020 two weeks ago March. Multiple variants already widespread point. can‚Äôt say 100% certainty variant could escape vaccine line, pretty damn confident data existing variants likely near future, especially vaccination rates pick infections go down. I‚Äôm sure blank cards filled out. You‚Äôll 2 cards, one original, one necessary booster. live Florida, right coast, smack dab tourist destination, ""sheer hell"" I've gone state license plates people crowding beaches (even usually) excessive traffic. 

A lot hospitals billboards live ticker, even apps, current ER wait times. past several months, usual ER wait time around 10-15 minutes.

The Florida ignorance used low hanging karma. doesn‚Äôt make sense, can‚Äôt afford place shouldn‚Äôt expect landlord foot bill order live there? move find cheaper place that‚Äôs within budget. think got around 94% Israel asymptomatic too. Similar experience. suspected COVID April 2020 thing happen 1st dose Moderna. Felt awful (fever, aches, couldn‚Äôt move arm) starting somewhere around 24 hours next 8-12 hours. like gone... wife thought exaggerating bc felt nothing 2 doses Pfizer. post makes feel better. Nervous 2nd dose weeks. won't. seems like media wants torpedo positive vaccine news. One local newspapapers leading title today stating: "" Yes, fully vaccinated people still transmit covid"". article states likely uncommon. misleading disingenuous headline makes people want get vaccine. fear clickbait, this? Pisses off. number people vaccinated growing linearly. virus grows exponentially. need big head start vaccinations win race

It depends exponent starting from, race ends. linear progression easily beat exponential growth exponent small enough line close enough. Haha buzz kill. It‚Äôs progress though hopefully gets eased soon.   Well merit criticism Conservatives. However like decade ago.... Liberals could done something years. Conservatives hook either.
And raked coals putting eggs one basket China opposed diversifying portolio early, waiting 3 months take action told deal. country aware of. Another year?! Try memorial day. US nearly normal summer. agree COULD done. right vaccination records exist patchwork private/public clinics &amp; pharmacies sizes.

I got mine CVS (registered via CVS). friends got hospital. Parents public vaccination clinic. know folks ""registered"" got Rite-aid, Walmart etc.

They COULD merged central DB.... would quite task.  Hopefully, government clearly incapable buying own. agree completely. hope loved ones vaccinated soon. think federal approach cities needed happen yesterday.

I live area access tight. Many success driving rural areas feds state huge sites much demand.

Not everyone that, understand. üö®üö® Everyone New York eligible vaccine starting April curious- concerned vaccines you‚Äôve taken way? new? Might interesting see viariant three had. many reasons JnJ definitely preferable mRNA. Storage one. ease single shot cannot understated well, many people can't take time two shots, especially side effects mean two days work pay, mention people hard reach rural folk homeless. need question guy/dudette's choices man, vaccines good get them. hope it‚Äôs bad she‚Äôs forecasting .

I mean, given vaccine numbers projections, think indeed bad, also admitting vaccines work. false, work great. really can't figure would dire. There's literally end tunnel within walking distance CDC director literally crying prognosis. happy though, according Conservatives we're back line getting vaccinated 2022. Surely must ecstatic Libs projected beat bar Conservatives set much. thing happening San Diego, saving purchase home happy progress making Bay Area techies starting moving here, gloating ""how cheap here"" completely destroyed housing market. sure got downvoted. rare. right! government scam along tank economy piss people off. Let's open everything right clearly makes difference!! problem people need hear messaging, people going run get shot second can, trust public health officials. CDC push vaccinations strongly might actually counterproductive.  true. work Clayton, MO (STL suburb) live St Clair County, IL right across river. 6 people work office, 32 years old youngest one 12 years, co workers 40s 50s. co workers also live MO. Guess first one office vaccinated today county IL opened residents live work there. Meanwhile, one co workers MO 50s finally got notified Friday sign up.  need chill. simply asked clarify. understand reasoning. This. add Samoa Joe's vaccine doses mix, 141‚Öî% protection.

And spells disaster COVID-19 SACKERFICE!

üö®üö®üö®üö®üö® New York tired waiting eligible üòë guess good thing live somewhere high proportion people want shot Still EU exports vaccine produced EU, UK US not. EU exported lot got single dose vaccine back country. would put full export ban vaccine beginning, like US did, situation would surely look much different. kids recovered. Israel vaccinate recovered till last month, many consider need vaccine.

86.5% adults either vaccinated recovered officially probably even unreported recovered. rest either anti vaxx teens care. 28% population 16. I'm pretty sure Canada's actually track dose every adult mid-June based doses shipments expect arrive. Definitely agree Israel's road map optimism without good reason. 

I live area (outside Philadelphia) vulnerable nearly vaccinated enough. wife, wife's family, many coworkers, conditions age puts real risk much want shot can't get one yet. This, watching many states go full availability 23% first shot (hi deep south), extremely frustrating.

Being almost help lose loved one next couple months. background level risk going northeast, scary us still basically live 2020's world. Cases mean much aggregate death used to. minority, still terrifying.

Sorry rant. Vaccinating younger people first may answer. way better win race wave, cutting close. True. people know J&amp;J hope they're protected well lol New York New Jersey strictest lockdowns country spiking right now. Looks like can‚Äôt blamed states reopening citation what?  honestly think telling people panic ""impending doom"" effective messaging positively influence anyone's behavior point?

You're defensive CDC. Dude chill. Yes, fact deal one shot worth reduced efficacy. there's nothing wrong that. may feel differently that's ok too. There's way CDC Cards serve official ""Vaccine Passports"". They're basically like reminder cards dentist gives next cleaning. millions people already uploaded pictures social media trivial create fake photoshop sheet card stock, like security features. I'll play devil's advocate. someone already covid need vaccine?  sibling comment basically said vaccines, comment balance.

The issue never 'living government boot', always *actually something* fix Covid. Thankfully science come rescue vaccines, people much - go clinic get jabbed. Even consumption addled might able manage that. 90% asymptomatic cases better 90% transmission reduction since asymptomatic cases transmit miniscule amount. Asymptomatic presymptomatic, transmits slightly more. Definitely, could 12 hour feeling tired thing knows seems like throwing away chance get behind us. could keep cases going couple months, could fully opened test/trace/isolate strategy like NZ/Aus/Taiwan. Instead looks like we'll continue community spread maybe next six nine months - vast majority cases children young vaccinated. half story. also larger number absolute terms younger people general variants transmissible also lethal.  causing worse disease patients.  Great strategy guys, thanks. We'll make sure copy next time need something :)

And wonder people skeptical creepy European super-state? collaborative behavior allowed us evolve apes people.

That's, uh, evolution works. Apes refuse help others political renegades, less chimpanzees.

Yikes...a lot unpack think people country think ""out this,"" time. People different philosophical relationships risk, even sickness death. think public dialog driven people full ""reduce risk costs"" train, part family's situations (relatively) comfortable pandemic restrictions. divide western philosophy started Enlightenment (rely science, reduce risk, defeat death) never went away, educated progressives (of one) mostly firmly believers. It‚Äôs also possible given incubation period cases started diverge point offered protection exposures happened 14 day mark, right? sub gotten weird last couple weeks.

Yeah, point we've got people vaccinated immune another spike virus kill fewer people. understand translates ""therefore worry anymore""? miss meeting collectively decided forget COVID long we're 500 deaths per day something? wrong? can't declare wrong keep walking.

If vaccinated keep wearing masks, vaccinated stop wearing them. People die unnecessarily. would wrong. Yeah. Hopefully provides similar level protection. people know got J&amp;J Many people believe world flat there's magical man sky grants wishes.

There's EVIDENCE disregard belief. 


The whole ""many people"" line bullshit throwaway toss insane usually highly prejudicial conjecture basis reality without taking personal responsibility it.

Some individuals use ""many people saying"" almost exclusively want present ideas want accept responsibility comes it.  think advice vaccinated. advice people not. fully vaccinated going start opening life, masks social distancing. lot ask people careful based circumstances. Hospitalizations increasing show people know gage risk. advice general hospitalizations stabilize. say 100% people care least one shot. think others say thing. agree, I'd argue gamble way investing wide portfolio stocks gamble: risky sufficiently diversified. real question why, possibility silver bullet end pandemic dangled front them, governments leap vaccine train ASAP? Honest thought here, hit 200m vaccinations US. What‚Äôs excuse that? think we‚Äôre closer normalcy group people like admit hung word ‚Äúanonymous‚Äù can‚Äôt wrap head around anything I‚Äôm saying. semantics irreverent point. One doctor, don‚Äôt care gave home address biography him, one French doctor quoted euronews.com they‚Äôre seeing younger patients hospital, substantial source make broad claim young people hospitalized sicker, especially claim OP made, zero mention anywhere, young people aren‚Äôt responding treatments. show academic government resources backing claim younger people hospitalized sicker responding treatments, I‚Äôll listen. don‚Äôt give shit doctor told euronews.com. Stop fiend desperate attack people question narrative. set terms...but get either, pandemics social end health experts come say so. 

I might add nobody saying now, little ridiculous ask people spend another summer social distancing using vaccines effective basically lockdown frankly unnecessarily view. however must said using MRNA vaccines substantially effective driving spread compared MRNA AZ mix. think using AZ real threat UK actually reopening.

I pretty confident UK able reopen soon incredibly confident US able reopen early May. Vaccine passports neither needed relevant country using highly effective vaccines. yes J&amp;J mix almost nobody using it. Bunch dystopian nonsense. It‚Äôs risk tolerance. you‚Äôre comfortable risk, take it! Lmao articles hilarious. like month away looking like Israel, people can‚Äôt stop fear porn. Dickhead iMpeEnDinG dOOm!

Walensky smoking whatever Olsterholm on. isn‚Äôt article says all. better source substantiates you‚Äôre claiming, please provide one.

**Biden admin remakes vaccine strategy mass vaccination sites fizzle**

The federal government found Americans ***prefer vaccination pharmacies*** expensive money federal government spent mass-vaccination pilot sites, administering fraction shots given across country day. ***Federal data show retail pharmacy program ‚Äî signed 21 chains 17,000 stores ‚Äî reach far Americans shorter time, according four senior officials direct knowledge matter.*** bottom line, sources said, Americans seem willing walk local pharmacist get vaccine travel federal vaccination site shot.

&amp;#x200B;

this bigger problem people vaccinated.. people become complacent (not hesitant, anti-vax) fucking lazy.. 

&amp;#x200B;

when 80% city fully vaccinated...

and weather nice, vaxxed friends going beach...

....I'm going tempted go beach, TBH.

&amp;#x200B;

but could swing drugstore go pick beverages.. clear Americans feel comfortable relying local pharmacies vaccine,‚Äù said one senior Biden health official. ‚ÄúThe retail pharmacy program keep growing think ***begin see people going block CVS get shot driving maybe hour*** federal sites get it.‚Äù pure speculation point. linear growth vaccination change R number virus. race we're certainly going win. question many people let die unnecessarily along way. even read article? Government PEI already suspended use AstraZeneca Vaccine due blood clots morning.

The rest Canada following suit later today.

Lot's low IQ people making decision eh see It‚Äôs opinion need accept shitty situation. 

You epitomize ‚Äúwe‚Äôve tried nothing ideas‚Äù American optimism refreshing see. Us Brits seem pessimistic virus. wut think two weeks 1st dose Pfizer know 80 percent effective? 14 day mark Friday :) scientist career depending conclusion? uninformed people want believe came lab. would help get side anti-science crowd. still 65 year olds want vaccine able get it.

My parents 65. friends got shots 2 months ago now.

At point, 65 vaccinated, simply trying hard enough. Shit, day dad got first shot 3 HCPs call try get people aged 40-65, many go work?

It's dangerous either. would card doubt places look closely it.

But fine, write second dose card need to. vaccines good probably matter much buy us substantial amounts time. people need stop comparing influenza 50% effective vaccine average. 95% effective vaccine get away lot seemingly reckless things okay.

The real relevant concern whether people stop taking boosters future. Otherwise much worry get jab Norwegian (m43) too. US UK production vaccines in-country, dont export covered themselves, production Germany etc shared rest europe (and more?), including us Norway. However - damned fed lockdowns that, really got away easy shouldnt complain. dad took antibody test curiosity cause got first dose vaccine 3 weeks ago wanted see got least antibodies, could def see faint line igG section chalked faint it‚Äôs 3 weeks however could also see even fainter line igM area kinda freaked us went got COVID test came back negative, could from? ""my source"". source posted person replied Awesome! Stay safe! ""Hey Joe, get refund?"" news transmission vaccination today amazing hope finally puts ‚Äúyou still catch/spread covid you‚Äôve vaccinated‚Äù narrative bed. fear mongering. actual scientific fact point. variants cause worse disease, surprising patients admitted worse shape responding well previous treatments. It‚Äôs beyond people feel mask wearing burden. work many hours understand that. wearing go store bus enter restaurant big deal IMO. second dose yesterday. within 10 minuets. feel like pure garbage today I‚Äôm happy vaccinated! model UK showing this. strange. Sinopharm getting bad results, like problem New York isn‚Äôt looking great either, seems oddly centered Michigan. near true. People 80-90% immunity wild type strain well probably pretty similar b1.1.7 14 days first shot MRNA. viral vector ones take longer work probably 6 weeks get maximal protection EU still finalized contract Novavax, looks solid trials far. ""a read thing doctor"". actual doctors working patients. Jesus, hell get warped around axle? also consistent studies shown, extremely large populations, variants cause worse disease. bullshit. scientific fact point.  Equinor listed Oslo NY stock exchanges - sure source stating Equinor isn‚Äôt listed. Well something like 1/3 US adult (high risk) population vaccinated. Seems like paper exercise point. ONE WEEK GET LINE GET SHOT First all, don‚Äôt shocked 95% gets adjusted point. ‚Äúresults‚Äù two trials still ongoing almost 2 years. could end 80 85 90 98 whatever it‚Äôs said done. even won‚Äôt fact, finding. it‚Äôs pretty safe say it‚Äôs ‚Äúgood‚Äù regardless exact number is.

But answer question, looking actual infections, whereas trials found 95% efficacy looking symptomatic infections. make reasonable estimate vaccines 90% efficacy preventing infections (regardless symptoms not), 95% efficacy preventing symptoms. instead messaging urging vaccinated wait weeks massive vaccine availability

This [literally MONTHS now. problem originated mixed signals generated last administration, simply muddied waters point people utterly given give single F anymore.  
 American I'm scared us - I'm sad people can't wait weeks get vaccinated return normalcy.

I get sense maybe, maybe director CDC access information analysis juuuust bit beyond average redditor, perhaps listen say things like this, despite fact contradicts hive mind. US exporting vaccines. UK exports large amount chemicals materials required vaccines, produce 2m vaccines week locally moment. country big vast huge variations vaccination rates could mimic UK Continental Europe time depending region. Even sprawling state like California pockets double-digit positivity &amp; packed ICU's specific counties, others seeing single-digit deaths. think really hard virologists predict areas impacted variants. better modeling could target areas first end like Europe. Ok, lift lockdown soon then? Nothing's ever good news hey Friday marks 14 days since 1st dose Pfizer. According todays published results, 80 percent immune Friday.

I shit do, go indoors errands without worry? obviously wear mask. Full disclosure, worked throughout pandemic, told January due pandemic, contract renewed.

Since then, applied every job sun, haven‚Äôt even received single interview. job market sucks, I‚Äôm probably six months away ending life. I‚Äôm speaking hypotheticals, I‚Äôm submerged harsh reality.  messaging referencing primary message coming White House federal government last weeks. also Fauci messaging importance getting vaccinated every platform every Youtube influencer known man. lack coherent messaging importance ""spiking 5 yard line"" Fauci put it. appropriate show concern still unacceptable number people acting government officials get cases spiking again. concerned right legitimate. fucking tired living like this, guarantee soon people grow fuck continue taking precautions. appreciate sincerity topic. Son sus sobras wey :(

Que manden las de Moderna PFIZER ver si muy amigos  upvoted you, honestly, giving *completely baseless* assessment Euronews (including bald-faced lie), that's victory disinfo war. know would want reward behaviour. absolutely need remove Euronews list. credible mainstream news source. ban cars? yup Looks like CDC data came today strong support fact fully vaccinated people 90% protected even asymptomatic infection, means fully vaccinated, low risk vector. real world data collected past several months. amazing news support fact fully vaccinated, people likely able go back living 'normal-ish' lives (though still strong favor aware things mentioned, including hand washing, proper mask wearing majority population vaccinated, etc). 

I know access data posted comment yesterday wanted add conversation I'm seeing it! coworkers drove 2 hrs away St Louis get shot Cape Girardeau. Yeah, sorta kinda are?

Okay, maybe crazy. Possible low IQ though? Get checked take AZ vaccine. it‚Äôs true mRNA vaccines reduce transmission 90%, there‚Äôs zero reason need continue distancing masks summer. Literally zero logical explanation continue it. I‚Äôve fully vaccinated week now, Pfizer. gone back complete normal. Packed happy hours, unnecessary travel, seeing friends etc. encourage people vaccinated well. pandemic end government tells it‚Äôs ok go bar. probably never recommend sitting restaurant. ends society (us) acts like it. 

Let‚Äôs keep vaccinations coming completely unequivocally normal summer. ‚Äúsemblance‚Äù. vaccines *are* silver bullet. going end thing. let loud minority redditors dragging pandemic long win! Worldometers, US looks like it'd plateau slight increase. 7-day average actually went tad yesterday. Bloomberg, quick plateau looks like much sharper increase past days.

Which one accurate picture? would hope Worldometers since graph looks like we're still maintaining bit plateau Bloomberg looking like beginning scary increase. ""I‚Äôm going reflect recurring feeling impending doom,‚Äù Walensky said. ‚ÄúWe much look forward to, much promise potential much reason hope, right I‚Äôm scared."" ...

This sounds like may another lockdown avoid impending doom continue like this.  LOL get Christmas from... almost 25M doses end May first doses. 30M eligible adults Canada everyone wants vaccine. enough second doses August likely earlier US supply outpaces demand send over. OMG. can't wait pick fucking fruit take whatever personal shopper picks! I'm severely immune compromised curbside year. fruit vegetable thing drives damn wall, especially since I'm really picky. Everything seen P1 variant still indicates vaccines pretty effective it. sorry burst bubble social end already begun, see 2022 children finally get vaccinated

For many you, never even began. sure eager set terms ""ends"". amazing effect doom cycle people. know people early-20s convinced die get COVID barely leaving house. don‚Äôt think trump ever defended sir  2025: We've 2x increase cases 1 2. need hang bit longer. Tell ya what, go live $11 hour make sure write letter response, since you‚Äôll selling cell phone pay bills. hope realise theres nothing outside home can't get online.

Reddit moment. feel adult one asked X vaccine yet might need soon anything like that. general get point boosters boosters assume shots made target variants much shot boost effect previous vaccine, mistaken?

Thanks help. numbers small easy double them. Less 2 people 1000 would noticeable average doctor unless they're treating thousands people every week dumb. Almost 0 difference 30 year old 16 year old. make easier open everyone far early tell since we've mass vaccinating people ~4 months (and vaccinating people trials months that). biggest clue long term immunity fall/winter, time cases massively spiked last year. spike much smaller, that's obviously good sign. said random doctor

No didn't. literally said ""anonymous doctor"". Stop quoted euronews.com really substantial source 

That random anonymous Redditor determine, especially one spends time spreading disinformation.

Also ""you mad"" stuff really best got repertoire? that's kind sad. Working culture Japan sicking. 
Jesus. Yeah, living Belgium I'm probably going get vaccinated next year.  They're not. last time checked? think lot people thinking we‚Äôve beaten since vaccines letting guard bit early. Why? appointments NJ. open eligibility...and nothing changes. people fighting amount vaccines.

The supply restriction NJ/NYC area. amount people eligible vaccines. ""big problems"" left COVID, sorry inform you. Vaccines far outpacing spread virus. 

And saving lives - accomplished getting people vaccinated. Telling people nothing changes get shot push people away jab. backtrack it? like anything else

""we've decided situation across country necessitate vaccine passports time"" Yes, avoid deaths, course want it. Everybody dies, still want maximize life. (i) unrealistic 

Unrealistic *how*?!? ""Everybody wants one get one"" quite literally *the* metric US using determine goals re: vaccination. they're confident achieving sooner expected started exporting vaccines need countries, like Mexico.

Do honestly believe goal attainable soon? within 65 - get it. COVID really, really bad. they've able get shots point.

This *wrong*. people getting idea from?!?! Take state, IL. According IL Dept. Public Health, today, **only 47%** age 65 fully vaccinated.  people claim guarded misinformation ""doom gloom crowd"", people sub sure prone misinformation ""open crowd"". 

If look every complete vaccination *in entire U.S. date*, 15.5% population, pretend every single one person 65+, *still* dosed every 65+ American, comprises 16.5% population. Yep. might still wearing masks, everything fully open nearly everywhere 4th July.  Jesus stop bullshit. ""I read thing doctor said...""

This data. data suggest young people longer responding treatment dying significantly would know unmasked person vaccinated? shaming, makes sense wear masks public greater population vaccinated. agency full smart people, suck messaging.

The CDC gutted decades. Work used done inhouse employees done contractors. benchwork side (the people made faulty tests last year) particularly treated like shit farmed low wage private contractors do. think way:

Efficacy decided looking two groups: vaccinated group ""control group."" control group unvaccinated random group similar makeup vaccinated group. idea that, since two groups similar make-up (age, exposure, etc.) near-identical number infections vaccine nothing. 

Then, compare total infections period time. control group 1,000 people 100 infections, vaccinated group 1,000 people 5 infections, would mean vaccine prevented 95% possible infections.

However, study perfect. can't force people live exact life, can't ethically something like spray COVID participants see happens, studies sometimes differ.

Pfizer conducted study found vaccine 95% effective *symptomatic transmission.* number caveats: submitted CDC look vaccine got effective time prepare submit findings ASAP. Also, study would require test everybody vaccinated frequently catch asymptomatic transmission, instead opted find efficacy rate asymptomatic transmission study over. Ultimately, looks like Pfizer vaccine 95% effective symptomatic transmission possibly 85% effective infections.

This new study. looked symptomatic infections, also whether someone contracted COVID symptoms. found that, based population looked at, shot 90% effective *symptomatic asymptomatic infection.* study also different focused slightly younger population far exposed virus normal, also conducted high-transmission period infections common.

These results fit together really well. real world, studies oftentimes big differences findings (which conduct many big, important things). two robust studies done two different groups two different timeframes showing similar results really, really good sign. ccp foam finger fans now???? used loud group whenever anyone mentioned anything like this, fact would applaud china chance got lmao jokes J&amp;J trials still ongoing, data become available time goes on. Typo? think meant J&amp;J instead Pfizer Several reasons:

1. Vaccines reached younger age groups. Unvaccinated children back school, parents probably vaccinated either. Look cases hospitalizations among vaccinated - dropped dramatically. Vaccines work, virus spreading point.

2. Variants increased contagiousness and/or severity (UK, South Africa, Brazil, California, NY, etc. ) making rounds, meaning individual infection infect unvaccinated people before, likely hospitalized. seeing plateau. enough unvaccinated at-risk people make hospitalizations spike, individual case may severe, enough keep hospitalizations stable opposed falling.

3. Mask mandates lifted things opening back up. making easier virus spread among unvaccinated people. Things opening elderly likely spread many people (healthcare frontline workers) largely vaccinated, risk individual case reduced.

There always going rise cases things opened up. Even variants, case counts longer big deal elderly vaccinated. large spike likely moderate one, probably followed spike hospitalizations deaths.

The thing vaccinations outpacing spread virus 500:1 rate. simply matter time. people get vaccinated, game Covid US. Look Israel, things almost 100% back normal.

It's almost like want winter wave repeat itself, even though likely won't. What's happening Europe what's happening different.  one aside industry lobbying groups wants easing restrictions

Somehow doubt **no one**. 
- West Virginia: British Columbia:  work better nothing know stuff goes. general I'm comfortable going 2 weeks masks places think fair public officials airing side caution instead telling us vaccinated go crazy. Yeah, small businesses years worth money laying around. Especially NYC. curious, think lockdown every winter prevent every flu death well? real. think first month two restrictions lifted I'm going home nothing sleep every day, unless planned social event home Yeah I‚Äôm whiny. I‚Äôm happy wear mask. guess maybe people around make feel better. campus empty it‚Äôs gets kind sad. I‚Äôm speculating, understand body ups antibody response Max encounters spike elicited vaccine (or virus itself) point slowly wanes. T-cell response longer term, maximum protection going fall winter, seems make sense third dose boosters, especially particularly at-risk people. maybe shouldve savings account insurance, look via SSN name. card streamlines process. insurance required, prefer bill insurer one... maybe get bit compensation Feds give them. much time spent Facebook skeptic groups produce sentence incredibly wrong? here

It's taught take freedom granted minute I'm going lot getting sake it.

Even driving shop next town hell human septic tank, Scott Lobaido say this? Small businesses get near enough. pandemic really brought ugly side people. mean always there, full display. I'm surprised Zimbabwe could even afford single vaccine. figured corrupt government would find way fuck up. would conspiracy theory? Tons countries require vaccines enter, would covid different? Calling passport bit wrong yeah, knew would happen. take word logic someone illogical concept ludicrous. fact people probably situation right now. Look USA, fools listened Trump, backed Anti-science campaign beginning covid usa, advanced richest nation earth worst hit, people ignoring science. Applying religion it, tossing blame directions. religion affects national policy constant failure failure. Look crusades bloodiest wars history. dead every world war, vietnam, korea intervening plagues combined. dirt matters people believe magical wizards sky. 

I dont care Francis Collins invented cure cancer, hes still insane believes god. Insane people sometimes good things, cannot assume right gaping hole logic. anyone's word, without proof means jack. scientologist, scientist, realist, believe real facts, evidence, speculation, preprint papers science, cold hard facts. rest speculation hearsay. Wait closed American business letting 100,000 undocumented migrants potential carriers high contagious South American strain flood country recourse? anyone take government seriously point. shows complete disdain American worker/citizen multiple levels That's going happen! Look actual data! work! adjusted booster shots! anti-inflammatory, cause immune suppression. Probably problem people already weaker immune systems, since sore arm may well deal risk lower efficacy vaccine. extreme outlier. hospitalizations hot spots like Michigan doubling last 14 days?

And deaths - lag hospitalizations - 26%. good thing small business owners got billions upon billions due 3 stimmy bills piece paper gets damaged quickly keep taking places. places saying they'll asking it, makes sense preserve it. risk minimal cannot used justify restrictions, let alone telling kids can‚Äôt play without masks. meant 1/3 = 3x ppl covid one better safe sorry. I'm case safe requires little everyone sorry means people die variants we're set back Going history, half posts deleted breaking rules here. havent banned you, obsessed subreddit clearly arent wanted in? takes outrace covid. forget 14-30 day grace period you‚Äôre protected yet, still much get sick.

It doesn‚Äôt matter many vaccinate daily they‚Äôre going catching vaccine fully kick in. 100% fetch foward dates. whereas Germany spent less 1B system actually works.

What? free tests everyone anytime, obviously working. need wait weeks open general population.

I've eligible 3 months. supply problem. know exactly well, would sufficient need social distancing, enough stop specifically covid know statistics chance catching covid without mask.

But mostly lack funding, no-one willing fund big enough study find one way another finding exactly well masks work considered interesting enough properly study. needed epidemiologists willing move whatever project currently onto studying masks.

It considered big enough issue study properly. knew N-95s worked know cloth masks, least absolute certain, enough put number it. work budgeted use card dont cash? I'd like.. ""well getting paid?"" vaccines choice

........they are. dad still prints directions MapQuest. though think OP means, like feel lockdowns indicate, work well bringing cases rapidly. however (long term) solution COVID like vaccinations are.

In EU, countries state semi-lockdown year now. Ofcourse year different gradations lockdown, even summer felt quite restrictive me.

Over time, people adapt lockdowns restrictions find way make bearable bending applying rules feel acceptable. instance, restrictions Belgium changing last weeks, think anyone really behaves different e.g. January (except outdoors activities obvious reasons).

Lockdowns used long term stop-gap solution lost efficiency tolerability general population would think. [The British Medical Journal: Lessons contact tracing Germany part UK, Spain, Morocco. Free City chooses remain British Territory. Incredibly encouraging preview what's come US, 6 weeks behind Israel vaccination effort. this, weather-related tailwinds north, high natural immunity levels across country, think people dramatically underestimating much better things get late spring/early summer. subreddit months, mainly got extremely boring. people constantly post pandemic going ""next week"" still around? Well, April next week still much alive. many false predictions now? LOL. lockdown much severe ever Yes, but... one person received vote confidence leadership eighty million Americans. view, every Trump voter shares responsibility. Anyone know Israel shares hospitalization #s? Thanks. know test takes 1-2 weeks result? Brazil disaster zone. 300,000 dead. following our(US) path.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* likely today could deaths single digits across UK.

Possibly, false number lack full reporting Sunday. comparison last Sunday's figure (reported Monday) 17 - Monday's 112.

I'm negative - 7 day average 62 yesterday (Down 85 last Sunday) - hopefully trend continue single figures May. Numbers today:

 - Pfizer	33,81%
 - Moderna	3,50%
 - AstraZeneca	11,69%
 - Gamaleja	22,31%
 - Sinopharm	28,68% Sir yes sir know people get annoyed privileged person complains something awful thing others much worse? doing. Much europe lucky get vaccine summer, elsewhere even worse. need wait weeks open general population. Precisely acknowledge difficulty, need find path make version work, interest public health (which trumps personal liberties opinion). private businesses like cruise lines concert halls want require proof vaccination provide service, completely within rights.

Public schools already require vaccination without excluding African American community (unless I'm misinformed that, please means correct me) clearly way. think people going surprised much dumb luck played numbers. know talking not.maki g sense, made big-brain point. Seriously Mr. Rogers morals ethics, makes sense loud ignorant dipshit like sees value Oh like bucks? like internet social media. Cases going people at-risk going impacted before. We're still winning this, compared entire last year. like us saying bucks. fogs glasses uncomfortable. makes difficult understand people saying. degrades nonverbal communication. soon I'm fully vaccinated legally permissable so, taking mask never putting back on. returned doses still valuable political bargaining chips, countries need point sold given away diplomatic benefits. appreciate that, yes, certainly people still think need listen Fauci. know aren‚Äôt commenting whether it‚Äôs good bad kids wearing masks, isn‚Äôt directed you, stories like make sad. irony, course, I‚Äôm guessing people type say ‚ÄúI wear mask science‚Äù zero evidence wearing mask outdoors anything. still bit easy say 100% certainty, last days case numbers low holiday. hand daily deaths less equal 10 almost week now, skew weekend pretty damn good.

No can't morons. still control shot, mean covered get virus, protect around selfish twats. High-level points:

- study 4,000 health-care personnel, police, firefighters essential workers, Centers Disease Control Prevention found vaccines reduced risk infection 80 percent one shot. Protection increased 90 percent following second dose.
- Among 2,479 fully vaccinated people, three confirmed infections. Among 477 people received one dose, eight infections reported. comparison, among 994 people vaccinated, 161 developed infections. deaths reported.
- **They received vaccinations mid-December, doses first became available, mid-March, 13-week period included deadly winter surge killing 3,000 people day January. study also one first estimate vaccine effectiveness among participants infection ‚Äî rather monitoring symptomatic cases ‚Äî including infections result symptoms**, according CDC.
- CDC report significant, experts said, analyzed well vaccines worked among diverse group front-line working-age adults whose jobs make likely exposed virus spread it.
- Thompson said study far complicated ambitious design 30 years conducting field research. challenging recruit thousands participants throughout country wide variety backgrounds context widespread skepticism lack trust science research, said.

So never traveled internationally? extent avoid hospitalization death reach herd immunity stop wearing masks? Well blindly speculate, directly compare countries. European countries currently experiencing stricter lockdown rules UK, yet death rates remain higher. EU countries can, course, shut borders - [literally many EU countries start pandemic. literally happened, asserting impossible. 

I think undeniable high rate vaccinations one primary reasons death rate UK fallen dramatically recently. UK experiencing lockdown right now, yet staggeringly low death rates UK seen prior UK lockdowns. Lockdown explain all. 

The UK government took risk early - procured insane number vaccines. signed exclusive contracts vaccine manufacturers, ever clear vaccines effective. huge gamble. paid handsomely. one city, massive one. Germany's five biggest cities combined. Niice Awesome news guess also means prepare covidiots start protesting lockdown despite ending June. sounds confusing yeahhhhh kinda weird good life gotten thanks pandemic, going back pre pandemic world going suck. difference systemic racism propagated policies punish socioeconomic status policies punish antisocial choices.

Plus, vaccine card may required go certain places certain things future, something consider.

The vaccines incredibly safe, borne Phase I/II/III studies done them, Pfizer Moderna proven track record relatively minor side effects serious complications incredibly rare. data support risk previously unknown long term effect vaccine. really mechanism - ingredients vaccine pretty rapidly flushed system self-limiting. 

You've already COVID, right feel less pressure get vaccine someone antibodies. said, vaccine give greater immune response greater chance immunity lasting longer protecting variants.

Trust I'm 26 want vaccine desperately, US basically unlimited supply. don‚Äôt want app compiling daily whereabouts.

I want 2019 normal. ‚ÄúGet vaccine go back normal‚Äù lie we‚Äôre okay this. think shift start 1 2 months.

If want convince official calculation wrong, provide evidence. evidence based cases specimen date. report deaths Sunday? get saying sorry.

Anyway making joke. Neither would I. locked country year didnt stop spread? That‚Äôs least one dose, fully vaccinated. latter number still low single digits, recall. 

From understand, though, UK strategy prioritizing getting first doses many people possible (rather fully vaccinating smaller numbers) huge success lowering infection rates, since first dose already quite effective.

Personally plan using KN95 still traveling airplanes around lots people inside otherwise think blue surgical masks using . nice terrified grocery shopping anymore! Fauci always focusing cases? can't live lives fear hypothetical vArIaNt technology fight need incorrect. People riding bikes walking park everyday. Even worst part pandemic people could go outside exercise. Also remember year ago knew almost nothing virus transmission. people say coordinated effort trump administration let Covid run populous something, it‚Äôs really attacked.

i'm extremely online person, i've never heard anyone say I‚Äôm corporate strategy bank - common structure across financial industry 30% cut commercial real estate, people coming 3 days week, remote 2 days week, people hotel seating (no assigned desk). Certain positions (e.g., trading) likely remain 100% office.

I say viewpoints executives constantly changing, Street copies other, could definitely tilt one direction another.

Also, there‚Äôs less well defined plans here, we‚Äôre much comfortable putting people hubs lcol areas (Miami, Texas). used really put back office tech people type locations, much comfortable revenue generator types people going structure. 

There‚Äôs still lot hesistancy around 100% wfh, lot comfort around partial wfh, direct reports office you. Landlords make living, too. People can‚Äôt keep living rent-free months months (assuming pay back rent) mortgages &amp; utilities pay. You'all need introduce legislation demands certain level vaccine manufacturing happening Canada, permanently 

It can't sent overseas ""save money labor"" whatever fuck latest excuse is. 

You NEED vax manufacturing there, home, way ensure happen again. Yeah, think cautious ask rest to. Also makes good carrot stick approach getting hesitant people fence. Well that‚Äôs several percentage points blatantly thinking you‚Äôre immortal can‚Äôt pass others. So, credit it‚Äôs due. hope right feel like PA carry things like mask mandates capacity limits far longer required. Hopefully states dropping restrictions put pressure Wolf same.  horrible implications increasing racial segregation society. somehow self proclaimed liberals leaping joy? get strict lockdown restrictions. Lauterbach said it, Merkel trusts thought referring zuckerberg It‚Äôs even true. Increased activity people + increased transmission B117 variant likely causes. seen evidence vaccine failure. B117 overtaking strains nearing 50% cases, possibly point, numerous states. new focus cases. Cases generally metric CDC focused on. want virus spreading wildly.

They focusing vaccines, focusing masking best practices. Places reduced risk opening up.

Other people, idiots, will, lost patience, every wave, jumping gun. Mask compliance DOWN. Likewise local governments same, aggressively reducing restrictions. leading environment, readily visible here, people declaring risks minimal pandemic over.

The reality sensible person buoyed seeing finish line, give extra bit resolve show patience. I'm expecting it, since irresponsible people fucking rest us since day one thing, happen. fundamentally true.

Australia, NZ, UK, many EU/ European countries, US states Canada least restrictions. likely many clearly never read Guardian. self-loathing another level. 15% ICU beds available.

Isn't quite lot? imagine want ICU running less around 80% occupancy anyway waste resources. That‚Äôs mine now...the fire proof box. thinking traveling next state day overnight trip moved area summer 2019 didn‚Äôt get explore much lock down. plastic envelope it‚Äôs kinda bulky laminating might better. Also looking digital pass found that‚Äôs thing here. lot vaccine hesitancy African American community, largely result shitty treatment medical community historically. likely low vaccine turnout proportionally excluded many events vaccine passports become thing. Crazy self proclaimed liberals support shit Twitter way would locked forever understand it. vaccinated people don‚Äôt spread virus, research indicates this, according reading. doctor. immunologist. Wow good news That's true all, though.

The UK praised right start pandemic quick set SAGE take thorough science-driven approach pandemic. 

That forgotten case numbers deaths started rise, would done anyway, everyone looked someone blame. 

We've world leader developing treatments COVID, developing vaccines, sequencing understanding variants. minutia lockdown restrictions inconsequential compared that. fundamental bottom line public used common sense, lives saved, haven't, they've lost. sure you‚Äôre downvoted personal choice looking Mom. Sounds like family making safest bet yourselves. Hope get vax soon! Lockdown effective thing room. vaccination pace also reason drop. current former POTUS, CDC Director, director NAID, FDA said need many people get vaccinated can, get first vaccine you‚Äôre able to. enough people get it, it‚Äôll cause major problems us. really need policy put pressure people get it.  would app, came that. wouldn‚Äôt tell everyone loses tiny paper they‚Äôre luck lol know pandemics existed long even kind virus labs. crazy know claim pandemic start lab use kind prove theory. still talking?

If really waits May 1st open everyone entire month Aprils available appointments go unused wasted could someones arm.  I'm doc Emergency Department think every one colleagues someone threaten kill them. even phase anymore. tell someone something want hear, death threats happen. business owner lives matter!

Can't hurt business owners, even hurt people. matter anything else. someone think business owners? Republican Governors moved quickly reopen. Texas open, many residents businesses still wearing masks. Covid socialism know came lab. Even medical community scared repercussions pointing obvious. Watch show Chernobyl see communist states like china cover disasters. didn't. test opening ""Is NHS coping now,"" ""Could NHS continue cope worthwhile period opened up?"" That's exactly good system europe lol Good. March 2021 70% Americans 65 initiated vaccination around half completed it.

You‚Äôre kidding think that‚Äôs enough prevent surge hospitalizations/deaths. We‚Äôre excited vaccine rollout, need look *today* hope months. doctor assumed bronchitis back early January, 2020. mom battled bad flu week before. always wonder that...

Otherwise, family good ""locking down"" first month so, living cautiously since then. Never caught (knocks wood), even sister, teacher came contact it, never caught (tested multiple times). mom fully immunized, sister got second shot, got first week ago. I'm ready summer. distancing reduced 6 ft 3 ft, WTF? happened thought (probably correctly) Trump poised sail re-election, *this* pandemic came Ruined Everything.

This I'm telling everyone around me. would willing gamble large hit 4 mill day end April. agree. hysterical headlines never work. one affected one state official broke tears announcing deaths genuine heartbreak. Yes, Random Reddit person, I'm sure worldly expertise much valuable fucking director CDC. card folded, invalidates get vaccinated again.^^/s

(/s means sarcasm / joking unaware, clear, get double vaccinated card fine, maybe get clear plastic card holder thing keep safe.) don‚Äôt need cdc director emoting like vaccines surging people saved millions every week. vulnerable mostly vaccinated - covid isn‚Äôt tragedy befalls families right now. cases surge hut hospitals aren‚Äôt overrun shouldn‚Äôt something leading kind behavior.

She‚Äôs joke. think right lot people, unfortunately. makes sad think case, people resilient. adjusted COVID life within matter weeks/months, I'm sure adjust right back too.

My friends dragging feet seem still going things though. living pre-covid lives, going birthday brunch (at restaurant) weekend. bring good point though, perhaps surface people still dealing feelings fears upcoming change. I'm currently working small manufacturing business sending LOT emails try make sure get left behind ""priority workers"" vaccination (it going well). know one company total contacted health authority gotten employees vaccinated BC.

Pretty much vaccine rollout BC prioritized healthcare workers (including called dish vaccine), people underlying health issues working way backwards population age based (currently 80+). AstraZeneca shipment **supposed** used vaccinate priority workers we'll see actually happens goes non-government workplaces. CDC director warning impending doom rise cases. told light end daily vaccinations rising. it? It‚Äôs like last year can‚Äôt get messaging clear. know aren‚Äôt woods yet surely much better position past winter? goal get 100% adults vaccinated, won‚Äôt happen based resistance certain portion population. I'm sure CI's calculated, fully vaccinated group 2500 people 3 total confirmed cases, meanwhile control group non vaccinated people 1000 people 161 confirmed cases. Seems unbelievably convincing me, even sample sizes relatively small. try best convince them. flight Turkey last summer regretted it, horrible masking completely full flight. Definitely worth it.  slippery slope arguments.  That‚Äôs is? report huge (even though echoes saying around world)

90% reduction infection, asymptomatic symptomatic. means least 90% reduction transmission well.

Again, office, riding MTA every day since Labor Day, mention client meetings, etc. infuriating watching people get shots literally leave houses watching everyone else office get shots age loophole (my boss got he's kids' school board - attend real estate closings way getting shot find another way). ridiculous. thing Finland. I'm late 20s I'm gonna get vaccinated (1st dose) September/October. really sucks, especially I've sacrificed much staying indoors trying avoid people much possible, realize sacrifice made difference vaccination roll-out damn slow. frustrating stuff, admit. Study indicates say roughly month analyze positive cases variants arose from. scientific source provide say 40yo Africa issues 65+ developed west/east? 


Because analysis seems say that, since issues stake considering 65+ (or, better, 75+) risk population almost related old age pathologies, random cronic issues (look reports deaths low main pathologies running wild Africa). 


People Africa die young pathologies old people die developed Countries. I‚Äôve seen idea 10% could long haulers number neither confirmed convincing data definitely accurate. 

There concern fatigue etc may due virus directly majority x rays showed little lung damage instead could explained decreased conditioning due sickness. also ‚Äútrue‚Äù number infected. 10% relate went hospital/confirmed positive could relatively lower number compared whole population actually infected. 

Long haulers also unique COVID. happens people due multiple types infections it‚Äôs fact become aware problem.

However, article research report conducted Chinese scientists, almost work state. terms study, China conducted bulk research, presented team international scientists recruited WHO, visit January February.

And report [...] subject approval Chinese authorities

This seems like far trustworthy independent investigation. also consider team [denied even year pandemic began. finally allowed in, quickly released report claiming [lab leak However, time, Dominic Dwyer, medical virologist member team, also ‚ÄúNow, whether shown everything? never know. group wasn‚Äôt designed go forensic examination lab practice.‚Äù

Since then, possibility lab leak re-emerged contending theory. member USA Today's national investigative team [recently lab leak theory dismissed, pointing past accidental leaks (including past leaks SARS virus China).

With CCP placing numerous obstacles way transparent, independent, timely investigationm ever truly rule possibility lab leak? CCP treated guilty held accountable given suspicious uncooperative behavior? so, would accountability look like? miss part guidance published Feb 16th CDC published updated interim public health guidance since then?

This ridiculous conversation Agreed except glasses wearers. homemade cotton cloth mask good wire nose better stopping glasses fogging Good news study built control group unvaccinated healthcare workers, good idea many infections could happened vaccinated otherwise. exited EU despite backlash. #2 ass-kicker, still worth it.

I'm sure smart person, comment completely moronic.

Obviously, point looking historical data detect trends point future might look like. certain point, past data loses relevance future. 7 day 14 day rolling averages standard detecting trends regards epidemic.

If looking chart since March 2020 waves going back makes feel better, fine. I'm stopping you. serious person interested identifying epidemic may going present forward, approach useless. No, that's still wrong. Portraying contracts research building supply production option buy doses irrelevant vs final purchase agreement wrong best intentional misinformation worst.

The UK spent billions research establishing production vaccines early. EU spent fraction months later despite needing doses. AZ tried best, completely unrealistic target. completely unreasonable EU spend less, later UK expect equal greater doses delivered. sake saving money. I'll honest particularly care human life much, believe life currently living far superior life living pre covid. Lockdown improved every aspect life tenfold want go back before. 

No commuting, stores forced deliveries, everything want becoming available comfort house. live happily room internet connection even 2 years ago would struggled.

Anything spray head clogs within week-months. use bottled water refill cleaning bottles otherwise spray head stops working pretty quickly. Showerheads done within 6 months I've tried CLR luck. Totally. There's often implication cases get arbitrary point we're screwed. reality, vaccines coming regardless normalcy coming regardless. thing obviously sucks we're going unnecessary death suffering people keep shit together final month so, that's different sentiment what's often expressed notable presence lineage B1.135 Israel, think it‚Äôs 2% positive cases. It‚Äôs encouraging however since it‚Äôs less like months. look like B.117 might transmissible it‚Äôs actually able outcompete B1.135, high vaccination rates prevented establishing foothold despite immune evading capabilities seems single study Moderna Pfizer measured two weeks second dose ""full protection."" However, WaPo makes hard find actual study various links sprinkled story.

Edit: another user linked study. Here's findings:

""Prospective cohorts 3,950 health care personnel, first responders, essential frontline workers completed weekly SARS-CoV-2 testing 13 consecutive weeks. real-world conditions, mRNA vaccine effectiveness full immunization (‚â•14 days second dose) 90% SARS-CoV-2 infections regardless symptom status; vaccine effectiveness partial immunization (‚â•14 days first dose second dose) 80%."" Delay travel stay home protect others COVID-19, even vaccinated.

did miss part? You‚Äôre right , probably clear us. She‚Äôs director CDC she‚Äôs surrounded data experts every day. she‚Äôs really concerned this, put us alert. least downvote article oblivion lol .

I hope it‚Äôs bad she‚Äôs forecasting . think Covid governments budgeting more. economic costs lockdowns alone must huge laughed. Thank you. Needed that. Umm, no? Quite opposite. think fail understand sarcasm, ok. Life lockdown life though. Can't live way forever. Yeah kind turned identity people think. Maybe fear move something else post pandemic. increases chance spreading getting COVID-19. Delay travel stay home protect others COVID-19, even recommends travel time. Delay travel stay home protect others UK means small country looking population. think make fair point. apples oranges, data amongst vaccinated populations countries consistent. Vaccines likely going crush infection rates.

And attempt ""socially engineer"" people's behavior using fear emotional appeals going absolutely nothing. wonder many people previous infection sort natural immunity. Love article- like 3 almost 3k fully vaccinated got COVID, deaths VIP plays protective role modulating inflammatory cytokine storm regards COVID, makes sense would improve survivability patients get pretty sick. Personally, I'm aware drug market/in works gives kinds numerical improvements. think way treat planet terrible yes, solution stop living. 

I know people get bleeding-heart deaths. Death normal part existence every ever lived. Humans gotten better handle preventing mortality species ever yet still us still lament life perfectly safe, hermetically sealed box risks. Wow sick burn. Heh Even get approved use EU **highly** doubt allow accepted valid vaccine. undergone clinical studies shown effective. LOT people going get vaccinated vaccine (or already vaccinated).

And like said before, getting covid vaccine lock getting vaccines (after waiting period) might well get it. could get it, wait waiting period, fly US get J&amp;J vaccine best worlds. They‚Äôre they‚Äôre popular among actively vote donate money politicians they‚Äôll stay place far longer truly needed. don‚Äôt get immunity around 14 day mark. entitled piece shit. Ding ding sad Adobe Blues (beer Tex-Mex) Lakruwana (Sri Lankan buffet). Flagship Brewery also five-minute walk boat. increases chance spreading getting COVID-19. Delay travel stay home protect others COVID-19, even increases chance spreading getting COVID-19. CDC recommends travel time. Delay travel stay home protect others Thanks additional info. political economic agreements frameworks place make rather cumbersome get people area vaccinated quickly possible (I hope that‚Äôs goal). Maybe need work kind vaccination coordination addendum happen again. welcome BHAHAAHA Test trace work incredibly well, implemented early enough. problem test trace systems fumbled afterthoughts already virus saturated systems, significantly reducing effectiveness. Funny say that, huge stink conservative politicians Canada can‚Äôt make vaccines PM drive won‚Äôt bring back. PM replied naming vaccine production facility previous (conservative) government made close. 

Almost stuff Conservative Party complains fixed something broke. Variants created global scale. little vaccination done outside US, that's going far bigger concern vaccine much bigger issue short-term rises US. live huge state Midwest? northeast pretty easily travel three four states single day. actually false. Germany alone already put money vaccine development UK. happened UK far know. infections, rise last week, continuing increase. country averaging 60,000 new cases per day, 10 per cent higher last seven-day also rise country averaging 4,800 new patients per day, 4.2 per cent increase seven-day country witnessed increased trends hospitalisations cases last week. increase deaths concerning Dr Walensky health lagging indicator, increased 3 per cent last seven days nearly 1,000 new deaths due Covid-19 per day.

See, it‚Äôs one death it‚Äôs increasing number deaths. interest, poor, rural nations world median age teens, would likely deaths covid minuscule Studies way learn something. There‚Äôs also thing called ‚Äúinference‚Äù ‚Äúreasoning first principles‚Äù people routinely use work answers problems without running experiment. people suggested first doses first experts immunology knew doing. wasn‚Äôt random bet, result 100+ years studying human immune system. yellow fever vaccine card countries require bring travel. could see becoming like develops allow virus continue infecting people could create new variants vaccines wont work against. stupid listen rake seriously. Heh I'm even less sure asking. talking UK/US countries ? Yeah, think right. think weather warming country vaccines getting there, vocal minority speaking completely drown May.

To clear, specifically talking people 'hunker wear mask' also dragging feet getting vaccine. want anti-vaxx, lazy point. in, asking they're supposed end? requesting message let know end? UNLIMITED ... POWERRRRR!!! appears actual CDC seeing linked elsewhere.  hope time next year things mostly back normal.

March 2020: ""This time next year things mostly back normal.""\
March 2021: ""This time next year things mostly back normal.""\
March 2022: ... UK case support hypothesis variants scary increasingly vaccinated population. . already barely work South African Brazilian variants, minimal effect transmissibility. 

Let put kindly. need lot reading vaccines work know vs. know vaccines. Blutnly, false misrepresented information.   It‚Äôs time accept Covid never going go away. 

While degree caution restriction still remain vaccination rollout widespread, everyone needs accept Covid become another thing people die move lives. 

We came realization influenza 100 years ago this. every insignificant blip cases needs ass clenching moment. cool like 7 months allowed chill home family driving nuts want things go back way before. see lot people would prefer though, especially people work home. Everything expendable. entropy. I'd happy check back update days get jab Friday. opportunity choose J&amp;J Pfizer signed up. Decided try J&amp;J sort satisfy curiosity since heard much affects prior infections. I‚Äôm glad preposterous headlines comments officials like finally getting intense pushback should‚Äôve getting long time ago. know there‚Äôs way understand don‚Äôt sweep many millions died 1% 

The world 8 billion people 1% 80 million people worse war history 

Would happier people died? Well you‚Äôve certainly done best spread misinformation much possible prick! bet would one first complain situation way around. Considering know regaining weight dieting, overall prognosis would worrisome. like covid, everything know it. charlyboy_98 posted article deleted thread that's far objective correct comments here: [How UK gained edge AstraZeneca‚Äôs vaccine commitments ‚Äì pretend things based years research cooperation, funded sorts public private money. Private companies private streets private suppliers on, completely seperate public resources pandemic environment, reality. 

Even contracts included details ""the buyer"" would help sourcing products ensure viable delivery system. UK 2 plants considered sufficient supply UK entirely rely plants EU source 2/3rds jabs sound like ""proper Brexit"" me. P.1 ? fairly straight?

No, #science ... science. Hybrid applies certain set employees. stay full-time office. Fun fact: person responsible act self-righteous manner. might bit urban legend, principle applies here. Several years ago operators large airport Houston deal constant complaints passengers coming another large city. complaint travelers wait far long luggage arrive baggage carousel. remedy solution, Houston Airport hired baggage handlers. helped little, passengers still complained long wait time. analysis, found passengers spent one minute walking baggage claim area 7 minutes average waiting around luggage arrive. solution? Change arrival gate passengers walk took longer. still took people 8 minutes get bags, spend majority eight minutes walking instead waiting.

This dropped complaints precipitously. 

I'm guessing here, think open everyone officials going barraged complaints qualified can't get appointment. Rather deal that, officials essentially keeping people ""walking"" time being. become eligible, spend less time ""standing around"".

Again, purely speculation, would suspect kind thinking influencing decision making. everyone gets vaccinated wants get big red ""VACCINATED"" rubber stamp (or tatoo) forehead would agree you. point though easy way identify person chilling mall, without mask, person got vaccinated person give fuck.

I lifting mask requirements **everyone** **opportunity** vaccinated. going holdouts least they've gotten opportunity vaccinated extra risk point pretty much fault.  Nice see government finally catch British public, who've months already ever since grans got vaccinated. Lol, good luck getting point across public officials. still say need wear masks vaccinated. like telling young people, ever sex get pregnant turn giant blister. look around see isnt bad ignore anything else say. poor public health messaging. need focus safe making isn't, safer.  mention long COVID disabilities. feel those? shot, mean covered get virus, protect around selfish twats.

It generally mean though. True, sadly. Wasnt part though.  That's natural, even old immune naturally. Here's hard truth(which ill probably downvoted for): Stop eating animals, Factory farming breeds shit.  Oh rebel you... number people vaccinated growing linearly. virus grows exponentially. need big head start vaccinations win race, I'm sure we're managing that, given contagious nature variants people becoming lax masking social distancing.

I'd like believe we're winning vaccination race, seems unlikely. I'd love wrong this. case, think CDC director unrealistic risk. Pessimistic perhaps, unrealistic. must incredibly frustrating see cases ticking we're months away able vaccinate adults. actually put effort search yourself, find that.

Well ive looked. youve seen it, feel free share. Knowledge power youll help convert people Stop using ""show science"" rallying cry ignore experts.

Im much not. Ive looked. dont see one. could community share discuss ideas online, different places different topics. Good content could upvoted bad content voted. place would never devolve propaganda machine people say ""do research"" expecting strangers internet come across exact resources come conclusion. Compared 161 cases non-vaccinated group 1000 people. comparing rates other, that's 400 cases non vaccinated group, 3 fully vaccinated group. asthma real risk factor would known long time since asthma common

People think relspiratory illness means follow mechanisms reason Michigan work do. Especially inner cities. vaccine here. feds could flood Michigan hot spots stop within weeks. There's plenty vaccine that. lives, pounds. point lifting restrictions soon, COVID death preventable death. point 6-8 weeks anyone wants vaccine able get one. guess people expendable you. That‚Äôs odd. definitely didn‚Äôt downvote think it‚Äôs absolutely fair question! yes kinds distinctions come later hopefully. amazing news though think study seems reasonably successful able control could getting accurate results. others mentioned, first vaccination only. gambled prioritising first vaccine population really look like paying off. 

We still single digits double doses. yet entire country still shut down. 

Biden neeeds get US control. Every covid death 100% joe Biden‚Äôs fault One dose 80% efficacy

Two doses 94-95% efficacy Crazy conservatives taken sub  passport, passport full proof citizenship longer need social security card much anything social security benefits. like entire country sync do, plans succeed. I'm sure fine younger people hospitalized higher rate given current variants cause worse disease responding well treatments earlier pandemic. narrative ""young people fine"" false aggregate. Everyone right avoid covid much want, issue restricting everyone else‚Äôs lives incredible degrees societal impact that‚Äôs minuscule (once risk vaccinated.) should‚Äôve seen hard people laughed U.S‚Äôs COVID response better part year. Nah....you stated rules. not...they recommendations. also recommendations travelling. So, even recommendations followed, still decent human beings? Either way it‚Äôs great news. Idk I‚Äôm getting voted lol maybe article literally answers question? generally curious study people previously infected got 1 shot / shots vs people 1 shot / shots see there‚Äôs difference protection infection rate. news probably come much later I'm sure day 0 deaths drug overdose too, society going crazy trying prevent point?

However, earliest options (Novavax) start large scale manufacturing later year. Valid point, we‚Äôre wear near cars far big. 100K cases day, would agree, it‚Äôs case. That's government choosing selected group people needs vaccinated first around time. groups like essential workers elders. Serious question here. Moderna Pfizer vaccine 

Is first second shot identical formula? different? thing happened Israel. Old people get vaccinated - threat public health goes down, people go more, cases go up, vaccine starts getting younger people, cases go Doctor anecdotes completely meaningless. remember doctor Italy talking Covid already almost last April seeing transform mild form itself.

And know right Covid distant memory now.

FFS Kind of, that's bit generalization. 

I'm saying they're gonna get vaccinated see personal incentive. gonna hard-to-swallow pill many people reading this, currently **millions** Americans literally could care less whether catch COVID. amount messaging gonna change minds.

To get vaccinated, need offer sort *personal* benefit them. catching COVID personal benefit them. ""Save grandma"" longer personal benefit grandmas already vaccinated. told go back living lives like normal vaccinated *is* personal benefit get people motivated get vaccinated.

Nobody going refuse vaccinated specifically called idiots, accomplishing insulting them? Absolutely nobody going get vaccinated someone called stupid. odds are, calling stupid, concerned making feel superior putting others getting people vaccinated.

So call stupid want. surprised fix anything. ideological mindset behind lockdown scepticism would dictate add ""...to weak people protected specific measures"" last sentence. legendary variants 

Whatever variant ultimately comes ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt trust gubment, doctors scientists- Bill Gates ain‚Äôt putting chip arm!‚Äù Oklahoma going legendary shiny. Dude we're asking wear mask social want either things - get vaccinated.

No. 

You right tell put anything body. zero right tell many people wedding, july 4th BBQ, etc. 

*YOU* limit yourself. Thats it. Again, real pandemic, like ebola, wouldnt conversation. fact is: covid isnt deadly majority work force. great news holds true. idea vaccinated people could still spread coronavirus possible hang-up people hesitant take vaccine. Get vaccine early can, ask questions later think am. Check usernames.

So think drunk driving laws abolished? Private businesses, government buildings, outdoor gatherings, basically anything home friend's home. 72%+ 65+ age group gotten first shot. 

You likely wont taking shot someone older risk. irregardless

That's work, was, would double negative I'm saying exist, common said, re-labled vaccine cards marked up. I‚Äôm keeps saying this, April going sight see many people get vaccinated. could easily get 100M shots one month alone put big fucking dent many cases have. April unofficial start big party thing ending. got first vaccine dose last weekend. noticed vaccine card doesn‚Äôt lot number anything, says ‚ÄúModerna‚Äù. normal info? inconsistency. science says 3ft away ok, tell people 3ft okay. help stick 6ft to, distinction quite important lot businesses. time, cases headed people still infected.

I know complicated, green light red light. even vast ambiguity yellow light, impenetrable mystery. words stuff. stick it. link published results? think done first-come-first-served also pushing get exposed vaccinated. people vaccinated better everyone is. Based I've hearing people online breaking groups slowed rate created confusion.

With vaccinations expanding general pop states moot issue anyway. also case EU wanted negotiate price block buy price. UK ordered whatever cost? Hopefully soon! wouldnt worry. good vaccines... mean compare efficacy flu vaccine. Gotta watch lethal Grand Rapids variant! denver. luckily bought before. House prices like 20% year. nuts. agree. think good tell people impossible fact possible.

""That's going happen"" true. ""That probably happen, even does, ability something quickly due easily modifiable mRNA vaccines are"" much accurate.

Misinfo misinfo. say end May

and may rolls around new escape variant, people fucking listen bare minimum, like ever? Fired, little credibility CDC left completely gone. I'm sure bringing stuff said US banned exports

Because false. US banned exports. US built production facilities, secured/created supply chain, bought first doses facilities. Operation Warp Speed cost like 6-10x EU spent. Countries outside EU helped pay production EU EU ever got close putting ink paper they're getting doses result paying that. EU acted sooner willing put money like US/UK did, would production doses world today EU would way farther along vaccination youself whatever want spread misinformation.

This literally you. Claiming export bans exist. Claiming AZ breaking contracts EU order fill orders. Claiming EU shortages fault others slow act slow fund. EU institute export ban would violating sorts international trade agreements. big deal either per se, IMO it'll feel much better wear one everywhere. wear one many hours straight kind frustrating adjust decent amount, though small inconvenience major issue. mind wearing mask now, hate people wear needed, wear one anymore, I'm gonna happy camper  Sell land natives $24 beads trinkets.

You can‚Äôt give vaccines ‚ÄúAfrica‚Äù. give vaccines X number African countries, African Union, saying you‚Äôre giving 220M vaccines ‚ÄúAfrica‚Äù nonsensical saying you‚Äôre giving ‚Äúthe Pacific‚Äù really mean ‚ÄúMicronesia, Marshall Islands, Mariana Islands, Hawaii, Fiji, Solomon Islands‚Äù.

Describing ‚ÄúAfrica‚Äù unified single place usually done intentional malice mind, harmful stopped. I‚Äôll probably opt towards J&amp;J vaccine it‚Äôs around area

Oh available areas? aware that. Anyway, supply explode everywhere, J&amp;J become widely available. Yeah really matter get mrna not, great protected severe illness may likely get sniffles. Since already covid, J&amp;J could nice top whatever already existing immunity had. Fair enough. Guess I‚Äôve adapted hyperbole point. Thankfully, loan. choice say I'd gladly send extra capacity Canada. Yeah don‚Äôt blame people taking extra doses can. I‚Äôm start same. think we‚Äôve patient enough. Vaccines going unused rural counties state‚Äôs strategy seems trying get every single 1A person wants vaccine get one moving on. Ironically, centralized system appointment sign ups, sent doses populous counties mass vax sites set areas probably would gotten point ago. help many older relatives make appointments there‚Äôs centralized site it, go every individual pharmacy website exact right time get appointment. Wow. puts perspective. I‚Äôm 44, Colorado USA looking probably April May get vaxed, feeling impatient watching many friends family already getting California Texas. Since I‚Äôm uninsured I‚Äôve wishing would prioritize people without access healthcare we‚Äôre least protected. single parent it‚Äôs terror think I‚Äôd get sick, become bankrupted treatment worse, leaving son one. know age range there? missed bit news. sister head nurse major east coast hospital says patient load covid-19 cases overwhelming scheduling procedures normal. say range ages surprising far larger proportion young people (kids even) expected. noted virus seems create wildly different responses people unlike eat peanut fine cause another person suffocate.  basically simple ""you can't transmit infected."" Transmission complex process involves many factors like viral load certain areas (nose, throat, lungs, etc) actions (coughing, loud talking etc) base level requires actually virus body 

In study tested everyone PCR found vaccine prevent people getting symptoms (which concern) also detect virus PCR. means even exposed virus cleared antibodies fast enough take hold therefore around spread people.

So long answer say, need infected spread  woke broke, pay fucking rent like rest us ‚ÄúImpending doom‚Äù?? sound like moron talking like vaccine rates continue soar.

This kind shaky-voice hyperbole would appropriate maybe *last* April/March, now.

Good job making everyone instantly tune out. comparison cars &amp; covid cars &amp; work/social life  Oh shut would you. Texas seen decrease decrease even removing mask mandate.

Well done sir ‚ÄúThe UK US could nobody else did.‚Äù

Sure, limited supply ordering early supply clearly difference U.K. Europe.

The U.K. force European politicians call vaccine ‚Äúquasi-ineffective‚Äù. U.K. force EU go double-dose strategy instead single-dose. U.K. reason EU chose pause vaccinations advice due fears minuscule chance blood clot. U.K. reason EU sitting millions unused vaccines last week.

It show 80% response, data long 52% response would last, whether waiting beyond recommended 3-4 weeks would interfere complete vaccination. EVERY SINGLE TIME this, vulnerable vaccinated. listening science, admitting surge likely lead less death previous ones. cause *particular* kind clots. doubt that. Croatia vaccinating slowly, still expect vaccinate 50% adult population summer. Simply looking way, adult, definitely wait next year agree! don‚Äôt want get vaccinated problem, don‚Äôt around others, don‚Äôt go ball games, don‚Äôt travel public transport, etc. yes supply longer issue shortly.  Supply outstrip demand likely may. That's timeline change much. That‚Äôs awesome. uncle allergic reaction Moderna one can‚Äôt get second one. Looks like he‚Äôll still highly protected without second dose. night second shot unable sleep due head pain. second night (last night) slept like 11. dad got covid time first shot last week reaction it. basically California... Time start living.

IMO still early spike ball this. We're close now, 20% population effective vaccination (there's another 10% shots still ""waiting period"" protection kick in). That's low protect overall population. figure mid May June we'll really see disappear.

Of course, vaccinated? Go it. could, would personally wait day two safe. Sometimes feel great immediately wake next day arm killing someone specific interest China, one first people start blabbing scary Covid anyone would listen. first one wearing mask supermarket, first one shaming others going bar. regret going far?

Ain't truth. introvert miss hanging friends could really use wife taking weekend trip soon get proper alone time. love wife, around 24/7 let truly release tension. whole day speak great recharge So? still isn‚Äôt contract signed Novavax won‚Äôt exporting EU. 

I‚Äôd also think EUs recent actions may part thats case (along they‚Äôve signed one last 6+ months). mean who‚Äôs going sign best efforts contract EU know may able source materials needed might production issues. can't manage pandemic locally border controls states. see waves going back forth.  I'm losing mind WFH year now. I'm trying understand mentality people want work forever place eat, shower, sleep relax feel natural me. started new job June never even met manager person, much less coworkers. miss commuting work actually somewhere go morning living room. worst part think going back office going one last things happen restrictions lifted. I'm looking probably least 4-5 months WFH know much take. able socialize coworkers see outside box Microsoft Teams part makes work bearable sometimes even enjoyable. even miss happy hours! double dosing time might help variants too. data support strategy spacing vaccines keeps efficacy. Like others pointed out, supply issue near future. Death thing I'm concerned kids. messaging needs vaccine means return normal- Full stop.

No, vaccine existing mean return normal. large majority public received vaccine means return normal. Unfortunately selfish people want normal, vaccine. People *have* missed cancer treatments... hospitals locked deferred things. Hospitals overrun, even NYC last winter throwing Covid cases nursing homes. vulnerable people vaccinated absolutely laughable think would happen. 

Have ever thought millions people suffering due lockdowns? yourself, fact scared it.  I've never seen studies FR high, want opinion, I've written [this focused reporting vaccination percentages first doses adults, worst thing do. number matters percentage fully vaccinated members total population, including children. metric ""COVID over"" still years away. Correct, STILL haven‚Äôt seen spike. slight rise expected. implication two people familiar expression talking. I'm talking American. I'm talking you. concerning guys aid, two main drivers Israeli birthrates Ultraorthodox whooping 6.6 BR, Arabs, especially Muslim Arabs slightly 3 BR.

But tell entire tale, Israel unique even secular Jews normal religious folks (not ultraorthodox) past replacement birthrates pretty high birth rates:

Religious 4.3, traditional- religious (◊û◊°◊ï◊®◊™◊ô◊™-◊ì◊™◊ô◊™) 3.0, secular-traditional 2.4, secular 2.1

[Here](http://taubcenter.org.il/why-are-there-so-many-children-in-israel/)'s pretty good article outlines Israel's uniqueness.

None answers question high birth rates. think primary factor culture. part that's due influence religion average Israeli, including secular atheists. We're inclusive society common religious complete atheist extended family still get along, one hand drives traditional values family kids seculars, also drives pro LGBT acceptance among religious (ultraorthodox less party game). 

We're also less materialistic individualistic average American European, lets face it, kids huge investment money effort, Israelis willing juggle joy children are.

Of course that's opinion. way, relevant song hit #1 Israel, lyrics English. I've never seen similar themed songs hitting high places US Again, competely agree. well proper quarantining international arrivals. Ireland issue annoys most. finally proper system yeah disaster. Corporate America stay open Walmarts world allowing anti-maskers stores time breaking Covid rules. Ever see breakroom lunch offices sight customers sales floor? Everyone sits close together, works, eats talks without masks. Governments go small mom pop stores shut they're following orders easier. Bow corporate overlords. trouble is, absence completely sure infectiousness, CDC always takes position caution damage caused virus. considering damage caused mental health, damage overdoses, people able afford healthcare due economic damage. 

The CDC also recommend never steak cooked less medium well two alcoholic drinks. approach risk Americans share. Huh? Going school entire time? living rock? sums perfectly.

Most people waited couple months elderly truly at-risk people (read: immunocompromised) could get vaccinated. Even states like PA, happened. someone immunocompromised elderly jabbed yet, simply trying. Shots easily obtainable put bare minimum effort.

There times county drives open multiple days trying get 65+ individuals fill up. call center scheduling available ""I can't use internet"" excuse there. fact state move 1B immediately sign something messed up.

Personally, lost saw anti-mask, anti-social distancing family friends celebrate getting shot. people responsible pandemic lasting year+ happily getting shots now. think worry anyone judging you. political happened business owner rights? Kind funny whole covid thing politicized makes certain people become hypocrites. ‚ÄúYou allowed deny service someone gay someone refuses vaccinated!‚Äù Perhaps side effect product genetics, gene behind rare UK, elsewhere. First. ambivert (mix intro extrovert) . Introvert mean like social interaction. do. need lot time themselves.

Second. assume wonder much online discourse revolves around people don‚Äôt want pandemic end.

Have considered people anxious returning world catered towards extroverted folks? Extroverts rewarded talking loudest room necessarily smartest.

This reason keep pandemic restrictions forever. I'm recommending step introvert's shoes day see may coming from. disagree, I‚Äôm concerned anti accents harm place others in. everyone able vaccine feel chose abstain right forfeit right things place others harm. Like flying, bus, going school, etc Look Czechia, 26000 deaths, 1.6 millions infected, 40% people want vaccine, politician even believe DHL planes spreading infection cities. Numerous demonstrations totally disorganized approach infection. Idiots get offended idiots get offended. find really interesting that, better worse, popular opinion Reddit almost topic rarely mirrors real world well. friends Mexico, NO! seriousl restrictions unlike US  half hearted masking states

this top higher rate vaccination among elder population.

Oh government already planning head boosters Well fact see ended guess cared more. Lesson learned least.

the difference time get sent home literally reason whereas needed running decent temp we'd go get - ludicrous Yes, need something waiting people side.

Walk-ins convention center still limited priority groups far aware. intent walk-in system reduce burden schedule reservations. free-for-all.  take order shortage raw materials needed manufacture vaccine, turn sale 100m doses worth hundreds millions. sub completely drained empathy shots started going arms.

It‚Äôs pretty pathetic watch; someone really use case study psychology. chance death - long term symptoms they're beginning see children virus includes children asymptomatic mild cases - severe cases. purposefully punishing anyone negatively impact cannot vaccinated want live normal life (not children adults cannot get vaccine well). good news collar counties getting vaccines. philly bottle neck getting shots arms.  I'd surprised turned beneficial. tend need use higher doses normal prophylactic measures hospital. Nobody hospital uses aspirin main DVT agent. decided vaccines stop transmission, even though science never actually showed that.

The reality COVID statistically deadly illness community transmission kept manageable level. course, keeping people home constantly one way manage transmission long-term strategy that's humans social creatures. Young people tend highly social far less suspectable severe and/or deadly bout COVID older people still spread COVID easily. 

Therefore, would seem prudent tell young people vaccinated socialize safely spread COVID protect health. message went with? NO. Seatbelts near inconvenience mask lockdown isn‚Äôt even opening understandable pace, it‚Äôs incredibly slow. Canada extremely enthusiastic AZ moment, point Ontario health minister took shot front cameras woo sceptics.

 sudden turnaround unusual. Perhaps troubling information grapevine investigated ASAP.  Oh worries mate, end world, cares anyway. see stand comments. I'm Virginia, I'm getting first Moderna shot tomorrow. Appointments starting open up, indicates fall eligibility guidelines want vaccine gotten it. Trying looking CVS website appointments area. openings, go ahead schedule appointment. wait Virginia open public, May 1 (if even then). Also, check r/virginia. daily posts listing appointments available. strategy worked well UK. ""wait 2 weeks""  Wrong. People fail realize effective 95% effective vaccine really is. 99.5% reduction spread people area vaccinated. Even real efficacy 85% B1.1.7 like Novavax suggests, still looking like 97-98% reduction given reductions transmission also occur everyone vaccine Omg. ok save comment copy-paste see ridiculous COVID BS mocking? perfect response. US get rid grand juries. US Liberia still them. Police collect evidence, contact prosecutors they'll recommend whether charge based evidence. That's works everywhere else far know.  Thought I'd share date data efficacy single dose mrna vaccines. agree, data available, 3 week interval made sense. know now, considering AEs, think seriously consider expanding time mrna doses.

52% first 2 weeks days 0-14). closer 80% week 3 90% 30 days. prevention infection, severe disease.

Mmwr publised real-world conditions, mRNA vaccine effectiveness full immunization (‚â•14 days second dose) 90% SARS-CoV-2 infections regardless symptom status; vaccine effectiveness partial immunization (‚â•14 days first dose second dose) single dose BNT162b2 mRNA COVID19 vaccine immunogenic vast majority (92%) study cohort 21 days post vaccination, result compatible trial data timing cases accrued phase 3 study, vaccine failures period doses occurred shortly vaccination, suggesting short term protection dose 1 high day 10 vaccination (Polack et al, 2020). Using data cases observed day 15 21, efficacy symptomatic COVID-19 estimated 89% (95% CI 52-97%). sound like Anti-maskers beginning this. mom Covid October last year. sick days something interfered prescribed medicine weird.

When got shot, day fever aches such, basically symptoms Covid. totally fine next day.

 non-scientist guess get symptoms before, &lt;24 hours weeks ago people swore get even spike cases. seem like Texas effect much it. Maybe higher natural immunity? Czechia like since September. highest infection death toll counties 1 million inhabitants. third wave extremely hard suppress mortality rate higher. Even hospitalization rate March highest start infection. Death rate 150 per day average weeks. P.1 FTW! New variants herd mentality! it‚Äôs good don‚Äôt actually say everyone guess. Lol really think commission would giving us shit dared stray away wanted do? There‚Äôs even article last year UK criticised opting  Sadly going find nasty variants first hand USA.

Lol we've waiting new variants kill us since January. almost April significant spike. going happen. US vaccine surplus offer transport persons J&amp;J shot arrival one two shot US long enough get 2nd dose. Sea, land, air transport less likely catch spread illness good deed

hopefully one oral vaccines proves effective soon might make easier vaccinate traveling jobs like need one dose... This. voted Biden happy won, political/medical establishment's pandemic messaging abysmal lately. cannot think worse way encourage people get vaccinated, willing mask, etc fear monger like this. Fantastic results. worth noting 72% people study aged 18-49 (not typical population). Also, health workers, exposure virus better protected (also typical population). way next 5 years cases near 0 2 weeks row

Mark words Interesting. aunt came covid pretty early process ( last March ), sent concerned right borderline paranoid. help spent 7-8 weeks recuperating sure happy did. number people thirties forties admitted Michigan hospitals COVID-19 **matches** numbers state‚Äôs fall-winter surge, according Michigan Health Hospital Association.


Young people vaccinated, older people are. young people seeing number cases previous surges cases older populations rising amount. basic common sense.

I asking proof ""younger people showing much sicker need medical attention before"". showed exactly same... Plenty upper middle class people considering upper middle 106k 376k. family middle class parents would spend 10k+ trips Europe Hawaii. surprised afford smart money. Even US, 65+ crowd (and especially 75+ crowd) highest uptake numbers group, exactly reason. mom remembers waiting line get vaccinated polio smallpox, really young former, parents knew plenty people got polio younger. lot easier remember important vaccination lived time people died would consider eradicated diseases. Younger people, who've largely lived post polio post smallpox world, largely vaccinated things children, know common killed permanently disabled communicable disease. much agree method, realize Americans barely vacation days per year, quarantine/test PTOs used up... hence unlikely put place Granted I'm American, likelihood gets adopted roughly 0%, even leaves lot compliance establishment.

And large private gatherings? going enforcement wedding party spreads easiest? Probably not. It‚Äôs almost April 2021, dozen states either opened eligibility everyone plan shortly, still people angry ‚Äúline-jumpers‚Äù. Honor doesn‚Äôt mean shit you‚Äôre hospital dying. Vaccinated people going back normal without reservation. Telling people wear masks outdoors BS theater. else do?? patients technologically inept still can't get vaccine usually either living like recluse part sort elder care system.

My grandmother entirely incapable scheduling vaccine herself, got aides come place times week manage basic health things like doctor's appointments. afford that, she'd likely care home.

If they're well enough lucid conversations (and understand need wear mask, know COVID's existence), likely well enough answer phone doctor's office calls, pick phone call pharmacy. aren't, likely offered whatever institutional health services part of. everything normal Australia Well, need call people idiots? people fully vaccinated, else need wait re-enter society?

So ‚Äúover it‚Äù, upset going take extended precautions long plan to? Fauci every public health official needs stop discussing cases right now.

A lot goalposts moved reasonably weighing covid cases versus serve cases important. social economic impacts covid far outweigh risks data non severe case impact.

And important distinction deaths severe cases made going foward vaccinated versus unvaccinated. reaching point logically old person died covid, almost certainly 2 months get vaccinated, people don‚Äôt reasonable excuse accessibility

In USA need start discussing deaths terms ‚Äúwere able get vaccine 4 weeks ago.‚Äù It‚Äôs simple declining hit hesitation. People right get pace, don‚Äôt right decision impacting life Viruses mutate become less deadly spread more.

You half correct. Mutations stick around indeed help virus spread more. *often* comes along less deadly (if virus kills host right away less chance spread). COVID-19 already low mortality rate, also long incubation period high asymptomatic infection rate - two factors great viral spread. case there's particular reason think there's evolutionary pressure become less deadly. What's crazy 5 years past covid, lives, time period seem like flew by, due events happened lives past year, people look back like went flash. known vacation paradox, drive go vacation seems long it, actual vacation seems like goes fast it, look back it, travel seems like blip vacation seems like lasted forever. require vaccine everyone eligible. Would probably safest wedding history. outside really worried.  Wtf? advocating MASKS idiot. That's France though, back runnning countries. Good Spain! Thats probably y'all nice things like this. 

I'm US sooo.. I'm sure already know masking going. read post think missed joke. Even current forecasts wrong way pessimistic. get everyone extrapolating past three months, production ramped up. isn‚Äôt relevant argument Every time see Starmer news, he's yapping away Commons vaccine rolled sooner, acted sooner, blah blah blame blame typical Labour pointing finger offering fuck solutions, regardless well rollout going right now. never good enough.

Labour fuck day every day mess they've created Brown alone. makes feel better, I‚Äôm getting married date zero thoughts, plans, etc postpone. Almost immediate family friends least one shot state making adults eligible early April. Almost guests want vaccine able get one. It‚Äôs year: either come great time (wear mask it‚Äôs mandated/if want to) don‚Äôt won‚Äôt hold you. definitely postponing. I‚Äôd wager lot people covid areas whats reported. think places attitude among population lax towards covid transmission restrictions, they‚Äôd also lax getting tested virus first place. 

Also, terms death, New York‚Äôs first wave early stages this, treatment virus still figured out. time big waves started hitting Florida months later, doctors better idea treat people virus. lmao shut ever living fuck already level ‚Äúdoom‚Äù ‚Äúimpending doom‚Äù? exact feeling guilt. I'm young mild, single precondition, genuinely debated days became eligible felt like stealing people ""real"" risks.

My PA wife slapped though thought - eligible vaccine available, helping anyone waiting. extreme risks taking care of, numbers game reach herd immunity. read reasons Norway stopped vaccination could prove benefit vaccine greater risk certain groups. Among people 50 4 possible cases death vaccine 0 death covid last weeks. cases extremely rare immune response, regular blood clot. Yes word street friends starting now. really hate lying cutting line won‚Äôt even give us timeline besides roughly targeting May 1 states behind us opening eligibility know actual ‚Äúturn‚Äù come? It‚Äôs clear would wait even longer May 1 Biden didn‚Äôt give order. lockdown brought death rate low. vaccine helped, we've fairly extreme lockdown 3 months now.

Only 50% adults vaccinated, enough herd immunity new variants. Also, first dose, 70% effective. Even 2 doses 100% effective. balance relaxing lockdown, doing, resulting rise infections. recently re-opened schools, infection rate immediately started rise younger people. /u/pro_phylaxis right proven argument support claim 220m enough least vaccinate risk people.

Thank you. study running UK, results supposed June. case reason believe would work. Actually common assumption beneficial since epitopes targeted, making response complete. also case vaccines different ones mixed. Eh, kind suck depending circumstance. I'll keep wearing mine long necessary actually fucking care people, lie say happy anymore. Guaranteed vast majority death threats coming conservatives. good political party, them. makes happy think roll it. certain point tuned idiot out. go move middle nowhere man. mountains fine, community people can't expose risk say choice. you.  No, want out. We'd quicker pricks listened first 2 times. Yes, they‚Äôre going DB. state every clinic, urgent care, hospital etc see shot matter type doctor I‚Äôm at. think problem longer part statement mostly positive, ""impending doom"" context provides better headline ""CDC director optimistic, scared recent increase cases.  Encourages people hold little longer"" completely agree, large amount people acting we're cured crashing holiday sites getting bookings already.

Why? WHY? I‚Äôm believing that‚Äôs case. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll get blocked. think Biden administration actively pushing narrative things horrible, risks greater variants scariest thing ever. reality, data showing everyone gets fucking vaccinated, normal life around corner. opinion want position heroes. reality heroes (not Trump. Front liners, Biotech, manufacturers, Fauci, Warp speed, etc) story already done hard work set foundation rescue took office. push past goal line. 10 yard line came in. higher 90%. that's relative effectiveness, absolute effectiveness. 10% chance getting COVID-19 vaccinated. Lol science conservative judgement, especially 1 year pandemic everything coming us fast. virus us long time get better idea real effective rate time. Colorado opens April 2nd! Huge sigh relief! Didn‚Äôt say weren‚Äôt free. said weren‚Äôt free anyone anytime can‚Äôt go get test suspect virus. 

It‚Äôs like Norway really free anyone anytime, drop clinic get test booking.

Here get booking don‚Äôt think meet criteria tell self isolate. Yeah is, message constantly reinforced Fauci, woman, every public official. ""The vaccine changes nothing, need keep wearing mask even vaccinated still spread people. may need restructure entire society around vaccination pass endemic disease tiny fatality rate business anywhere open up. Covid must completely eliminated.""
And people start would want Covid minor disease threat myself/I already Covid? open things care anymore

And yet exact narrative pushed continuously changes despite obvious holes. never point ""everyone"" vaccinated. Ever. Yeah. Traded back forth, notably Franco-Prussian War two World Wars. Yes chimpanzee friend. see, click funny blue letters transported magical website called Science Mag. one prestigious scientific magazines. article transported explains collaborative parenting allowed bigger brain development longer childhoods longer selected against, crucial part brain development. think part lot NY NJ folks got vaccines PA.

You're around 60% first, around 90% second. still 10% chance catching it, hey, fuck it, lets go Eeebeeffaaaaaaa innit fam screw everyone else long get want?

Jesus. saw interview guy Doomed Matt Binder last week really good.  don‚Äôt data confirm certainty, studies beginning recognize. levels virus lower vaccinated people, means it‚Äôs difficult transmit.

Speaking scientifically, never get answer saying ‚Äúno ability whatsoever‚Äù, exceptions occur, reasons optimistic vaccines reduce (but eliminate) transmission. Same!!! I‚Äôm happy got mine honestly time world change vaccine approach. There's absolutely excuse store SINGLE dose vaccine Moderna, Pfizer AstraZeneca  far, are. can't really claim 100% black swan case two. never find scientist saying 100%. PA moving past 1a keep arbitrarily adding new categories people 1a previously 1b 1c.

Long story short, however, national pharmacies care. They'll jab anyone and, judging social networks, secret. Go get shot feel like really want one now. first, probably 10,000th, ""cut line"". system joke point.

Likewise, also know many, many people going states (cough Ohio cough cough) get shot too. Like pharmacies PA, also care resident. least guys FEMA site mass vax sites. burbs it‚Äôs hard even find appointment it‚Äôs spread individual pharmacies aren‚Äôt getting enough doses per capita compared boonies. light end tunnel.

But Dr. Walensky INSISTS light train. 15.9% increase last week.  Yup. delayed second shots anyways, we'd 50% vaccinated live big country areas experienced surges areas didn‚Äôt. flare ups areas, it‚Äôs monolithic way approaching it. Texas California seeing reduced cases areas seeing increases. People confident vaccine rollout letting guard down, older cohorts reporting less deaths, thing happened Israel months ago. It‚Äôs multifaceted complicated it‚Äôs VARIANTS MASKS AIR TRAVEL OK, response fact states like Georgia Florida unlimited capacity dining bars since July maintained deaths per capita New Jersey New York enacted strict restrictions businesses (and many others)? note, winters northeastern states comparable worse terms deaths per capita, like initial wave thing still carrying bad overall metrics. 25 years? arbitrary, really long number? know won‚Äôt problem 30 years? 50? It‚Äôs fear heart it. It‚Äôs ironic people running around telling everyone else afraid ones actually afraid. say loud enough maybe people believe you. Oh well.  Free doughnut? normal blood clots rare type thrombocytopenia (low platlet count) + clotting, normally seen side effect medication. vaccinated people able go without masks. Incentivize people get vaccine hesitant people consider Eh, hate lockdowns Portugal example UK's vaccination rates super low numbers. world's covid epicenter end January, severe lockdown (stay home order) since 15th January. yeah, shit, lockdowns work, that's like using atomic bomb end conflict something. Consequences massive. Meanwhile, real world, Germany 7 day average new case count sits 138/100k, highest number since mid January. keep rising.

Perhaps states (who responsible awful management 2nd wave) terrible assessment reality fail German people again? regulators advised AZ 65+-year-olds (and backtracked two weeks) right France European countries approved 65+... Disagree sensible pause - risks COVID infection far outweigh potential risk vaccine, even link established rare blood clots. sensible option continue vaccinating save lives. international emergency I'd tend agree added caution, overall increased risk blood clots seen amongst tens millions people vaccinated far, mistake delay rolling out. Presumably they'll need account this, provide solution you. Hopefully sooner rather later.  ""defeat existing vaccines""

It would take years Coronavirus that, mutations might cause efficacy dip vaccines remain effective feel like deja'vu.

When news blood clots first hit like last summer everyone's reaction use aspirin. Meanwhile CDC director going live TV saying we‚Äôre reach see apocalypse stupid person general understand natural selection works?  way would messaging different focused exclusively B.117? disagree. stresses importance it. cried job presentation investors, I‚Äôd fired. Immediately. kids juvenile detention center? That‚Äôs ‚Äúlocked up‚Äù means article. hope right. guess, since believe facts, freaked many things done opposite recommendations scientists. cases still rise then? mass-cancelled appointments used link system including legitimate ones. Problem solved! guess. Question got second shot ago... possible exposure corona injection site hurt bit again?

I read antibodies hang around injection site I‚Äôm wondering site aching means possible exposure full exposure triggered response... ? People, voting people, know shit viruses. Never 100 years would general population, voting people, grassroots movement, suggest social distancing response virus. government authority consulted experts told people ""hey experts say, let's it"" people mostly complied agreed general concept something interest covid safety. 

I get saying, anointed class governing philosopher kings know better us. time yes government who's job consult experts sometimes unpopular things greater good. yeah maybe eventually people would vote government like unpopular thing (55 mph national speed limit example). Also really nice Southern California, feels like summer today - everyone gathering outdoors again. Also believe lot spread based climate seasonal factors - places US hit hard exactly one year ago worst states country. places without much spread year ago, like CA, best. seems like confluence factors posted, long factors well, really helping CA right now. Hopefully widespread vaccine distribution April never see numbers increase meaningful sort way (of course, probably small increases things open up, that's much worry about) message achieve exact opposite. might well said ""If nothing changing bother getting vaccine?"" see...I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs way prove you‚Äôre living ny circumstances. kind correspondence got sent parents‚Äô address probably fair game proof. hope works you!! 'My argument' straight fact. test trace money spent tests testing equipment. Tory backhanders almost entirely PPE. think take note vaccine eligibility opening around America need keep fed rhetoric types continuously share. 

The vaccines work work well, really need worry surge especially risk vaccinated

There always Covid deaths anyone hoping 0 deaths permanently point thats pretty delusional thinking read science stop saying stupid shit. Collaborative behavior 100% key superior brain development. Thanks! Thank goodness Dude... offence you‚Äôd living rock luxury getting reference. I‚Äôm even American I‚Äôve trump shoved front face every media outlet last four years. Anywhere read it? good point Yeah open may 1 1b/c doesn‚Äôt mean shit ? get priority still rest shots go non-1b/c. think wolfs done average job far like give people guidance Lol holy shit 4chan? It‚Äôs moot point (according Gottlieb) likely 40-50% natural immunity teamed vast ever expanding vaccine coverage. things much Europe almost Brazil lack. Nah, already locked long enough COVID. Let new virus kill people tired locked save people's lives. dumb question. get full immunity. mean can't start opening things meantime weeks time vaccination still needed full immunity, vaccines. delays things bit, especially people know wait weeks taking risks. got mine Virginia pharmacy. What's challenging pharmacies (at least here) right need comfortable tech need patient website. Demand high, appointments run soon become available. result, search one, usually see none available, keep checking throughout day. usually works better right midnight. honestly can't imagine parents getting frustrated that. I've sort become family's appointment finder. walk-ins game changer. white women forefront anti science things? Every single picture privileged white woman vaccines popped one suddenly found ‚Äúthe truth‚Äù?????!!!! Trolls bots arguing other. second responder seems think I'm spouting propaganda fell somehow disservice cause. asked genuine question think reasonable, simply goal converse understand, especially since things change frequently (on top that, people incomplete information latch preliminary findings suit desire move on). seems logical even vaccinated person transmit virus that's I'm trying understand perfectly fine ""we know"" ""it's clear either way."" ... right... like Germany, Greece european countries hard lockdown months without decrease cases... still stage vaccination drive majority vaccination sites (pharmacy massive centers) significant demand, issues connected 1) lack vaccine (In cases, logistical issues like much say second doses versus first doses) 2 ) age-old problem shows.

For example, article
""Another center Duval, Fla., reported hitting 52 percent, though vaccination rate site increased since receiving additional first doses Pfizer vaccine.""

So sounds like lower vaccination rate inadequate doses allotted eligible residents demand.

Every vaccination site State seemingly bursting demand. People want vaccine willing drive privileged enough access. Tinhorn Flats Saloon Grill Burbank get 30% effectiveness - 15 first second dose, 15 second second dose. posted minute Cuomo's tweet. Please, take advantage newfound magic powers. Guy really, really mad said random doctor quoted euronews.com really substantial source big claims made. bad still 65 year olds want vaccine able get it. 

Also, mentioned 40 65+. people aged 40-65, many go work? I'm interested population group rise really coming from. made year covid without getting it, vaccines around corner everyone, gets now? CDC: ok 3ft masks ok


Also CDC: WE'RE DOOOOOOOOMED!!!! Hey that's brand I've using entire time eating. Yay me. said right wing problem? stupidity problem cuts across cultures political beliefs, although admitedly seem prevalent among people already believe stupid things. Got first moderna shot Friday waiting second couldn‚Äôt come faster! right path! Mainly Africa young population. Well seniors know got J&amp;J hope that's case! kids/young people got mRNA ones. Israel well vaccination, yet IHME models look assuming vaccine effective, based future case predictions. Africa also young lot babies infant mortality reduced. Hence exponential population growth, doom gloom. line implying. think people understand bad things could get here. Like, like functioning society? It‚Äôs really not. don‚Äôt know others want true badly you‚Äôre finding hearsay articles clickbait news sources. Posted: Mar 20, 2021 4:00 ET | Last Updated: March 20 No. continue lockdowns evey disease would end collapsed economy able buy pack cigarettes monthly salary.

Lockdowns product people's stupidity unawareness economy psychological damage cause (this whole story). 

People around world never let governments impose lockdowns.  ridiculed source unworthy, not? demonstrable lie.

You said ""anonymous doctor"", not? demonstrable, bald-faced lie.

You come traffick lies disinformation shy it. called out, troll. simple that. Stop fear mongering problem last years old names become popular, states send ""you eligible vaccine""- letters toddlers preschoolers... (And east due difficultyies records, many states let post office notification know anything beyond name address) That‚Äôs I‚Äôm little concerned about. Say J&amp;J only
reduces transmission 60%. going two classes vaccinated people, MRNA elite J&amp;J people subject longer restrictions? Ah true yeah second dose sucks obviously good news already pretty sure previous studies? Well, mostly concerned new also dont even remember last time took vaccine something tbh. Well sorry burst bubble social end already begun, see 2022 children finally get vaccinated Yes. exactly I'm saying. article talking cases. deaths. Nursing homes almost impact cases Oh sure I‚Äôm advocating getting irresponsible basis 14 days curious symptom onset date exposure date obviously would different. idle curiosity. didn‚Äôt think chart going around showed 14 day divergence included antibodies certainly strong evidence. Either way, I‚Äôm planning play safe till 14 days shot two! Thanks response! That's half issue, half problem getting vaccines actually want it. 

A lot vaccine sites drive sites, lot older people cars need others drive them. wife went get shot took good 2.5 hours get healthcare workers. Good luck finding someone drive 2-3 hours. 

A lot people Canada use public transit. considered neighbourhood vaccine sites near transit stations. South Africa receive first 30 million doses, ready April production already started.

It finished filled facility Nelson Mandela Bay SA, although initial offer J&amp;J wasn‚Äôt conditional upon favours. expected doses would earmarked export first. simply capacity help Jannsen Belgium avoid use US finish fill facility already fully approved process health regulators worldwide. 

Over 200m offered AU GAVI purchase distribution areas continent. could potentially order given maximum output Aspen facility. appear SA using organisations vaccine delivery secured enough doses reach vaccination target 40 million.  It‚Äôd effective show rather say. Like, ‚Äúflying airplane require vaccine certification‚Äù would move lot people asses. i'll believe see it. Still bit skeptical rollout. Hopefully i'll able get mine soon work it, keep everything backpack bring work everyday. CDC Director March 2023

""Just hang little bit longer"" like getting shot driving ER afraid getting accident. Depends self righteous people are. Damn. hopefully get J&amp;J numbers soon cause that's parents got hope they're well protected exactly when? exact metrics are? put mine card saver 1! Fit really well. point though, enough fight two fronts work towards middle. 

I disagree. middle danger right now. people 40's 50's still go work. basically you‚Äôre homineming big mad said euronews.com random doctor tidbit quote credible source claims made. Lol. mass vaccination sites GA switched appt needed Kemp located rural areas demand lower. seemingly refuses reallocate doses resources higher demand areas. think also concern unrestricted travel strain resources areas. I‚Äôm 33 Staffordshire, Saturday went local community centre given asked leftover / spare said sure.

You attempted tie deaths vaccination times vaccination.  again, study US refers US, lose track actually talking about. 

In Europe (which really place vaccine passport issue even debate), insufficient number vaccine doses + inefficient rollout said vaccine EU members leads situation where, unlike say US, late spring early summer could large proportion people unvaccinated, choice, rather waiting line get it. ""their decision"" get vaccine time (as probably US), EU states far behind US w.r.t. getting shots arms population. Low hospitalizations deaths would make sense me, we‚Äôre nowhere near yet. Dang, CVS got mine set office supplies section way pessimistic? 550,000 COVID deaths last year US. 

The pessimists largely correct. Hopefully going forward optimists be. Kinda dumb headline considering technology long development cancer treatment others. Plus, there's upgraded 5G. Good news around. right thing thing gets fewest innocent people killed, thing tells truth many people possible. always thing.

If told truth masks early on, would tried get N95s, N95 supply would run out, doctors nurses able get them, many would died transmission hospitals. lied said work, saved countless lives so. I'm sure feel good go TV lie, sucked it.

Not Americans liars frauds. fooling think enough us cause big problems everybody. think we're maybe going see recalibration particularly expensive cities, unlikely see complete homeworking revolution. 

More flexible working great, find there's still plenty downsides remote working too, fundamental would think rooted fact humans evolve interact behind screens.

I'd hate started new role last year covid hit lost making face-to-face introductions worries people still early careers risk getting left behind given proper support need develop skills. understand airborne viruses still spread droplets, right? size droplets, hence different types filters different efficacy.  


Saying people getting tested flu equal stopping flu testing. easy get covid test less people going get tested flu.  


Masks lockdown work flu covid. flu. Common issue sinopharm. Exactly. need tell people 'hunker down' mask social distance little longer.

To clear, think good people still take precautions, point everyone gets people get changing minds. can't fathom people pro-mask, pro-lockdown, want virus end dragging feet getting vaccine. makes sense, clearly urgency getting ASAP communicated. look like downward trend you? delete social media general Nah, I‚Äôm traveling. I‚Äôm vaccinated. I‚Äôll wear mask take necessary precautions though. it‚Äôs yet. you‚Äôre fully vaccinated, fine, whatever want vaccinated people. people vaccinated, course needs degree precaution. 

The fact it‚Äôs year means nothing. That‚Äôs like saying ‚Äúbut I‚Äôve wearing cast long! don‚Äôt care isn‚Äôt healed, want go play soccer!‚Äù 

We need suck push through. I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre upset restrictions, join club. want rejoin life. isn‚Äôt forever, doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs yet. 

People saying shouldn‚Äôt feel bad wanting live life leaning emotional arguments. course it‚Äôs wrong want that, one said is. containing pandemic frankly important. Life expectancy low Africa infant mortality, no? Yeah, ""mainstream media"" YouTube video batshit comments like:dislike ratio 1:50 range.

I saw one CBS basically ""hey, we've vaccinated 10% people mean stop wearing masks right away."" Real reasonable, borderline common sense.

The comments shit like ""See, they're trying control us."" that's cause celebration, everyone head pitch pint?

just kidding! could see 3 months normal wealthy countries good access vaccines, like UK, US Israel, think going normal even relatively wealthy countries poor vaccine access (eg, Canada, am), idea long going take genuinely poor countries fully recover. Private businesses owning security cameras hardly thing government surveillance it? messaging vaccine worth much society mask becoming golden ticket returning normal.

Yeah, seems clear moment. Like said, friends still pro-mask, it'll probably weeks even decide get first dose, despite fact became eligible today appointments available. Persecution complex polarized tribal war mindset, side/team versus everyone else easier hate unreasonable extreme, pretending way people like really are. some, politics too, trying paint extreme views pretend common among people left Republicns. Getting first dose April 5th, can't wait. Well tell restrictions end? vast majority test trace spend huge amounts testing... sound right, know enough math dispute UK still lockdown type measures place going back months. 

These small countries compared US. applicable data isn‚Äôt clear me.

We wait see. Travel increases chance spreading getting COVID-19. Delay travel stay home protect others COVID-19, even increases chance spreading getting COVID-19. CDC recommends travel time. Delay travel stay home protect others good enough you? LMFAO pleases ;) LMFAO  Saying they've doubled last 14 days *is* massaging spinning. way look data honestly chart showing March 2020 today. Everything else spin. Actually read article. juvenile detention. EU lot things right containing virus, majorly botched planning vaccine rollout. US wasted money throwing everything see sticks, able safely reopen earlier going make expense. completely honest would prefer society people wearing masks feel sick. want everyone everywhere wears mask forever sick winter underrated.

In general though agree think know enough variants say vaccine variants bad flu. seems like thats case think know yet. right also end mask mandates variant comes people refuse wear again. think safe sorry move least right now. I'm Ontario, chosen prioritize elderly front-line workers, think BC opposite, would interesting see cases/hospitalizations/deaths differ result two different strategies. That's works all. get 80% *first* dose. 

You need get *two first doses* order get 160% protection - accomplished getting first dose, making *new* appointment first dose instead returning previously scheduled second dose. simply got second dose, go 90-95% efficacy.

This absolutely, scientifically accurate. rights favourite strategy: imagining left something they're attacking it. Remind me! 6 weeks Importantly means Moderna meeting one pledged deadlines 100M end March (just wire March 29!). Bodes well future pledges too, I'd think. hospitalisation rates vaccinated age ranges non vaccinated age ranges **stark**.. rates vaccinated age ranges dropped cliff, others much slower drop. 

Vaccines huge impact. again, level acceptable? 

Whatever infection level prevalent everybody wants vaccine gotten fully dosed - acceptable. Whatever level infection happens people refuse vaccinated vaccinated infected nonetheless - that's acceptable.

But acting like everything fine *before* people want vaccinated actually get reckless unfair. You‚Äôre right. don‚Äôt really want understand though. already covid they‚Äôre itching travel asap. wish wasn‚Äôt vaccine politics would sure Sinovac would approved within EU. concern increasing number people getting infected. People deciding ignore experts think won‚Äôt get seriously ill even die. think vulnerable people protected willing risk health. 

Experts worried increased cases means high levels infection, meaning least people need hospital care, variants much easily created it‚Äôs going harder control pandemic.

People think vaccination enough. going testing idea. J&amp;J statement

&amp;#x200B;

PER.C6 Cell **same technologies** **used** **development** **manufacturing** investigational Ebola vaccine, used Democratic Republic Congo (DRC) Rwanda, also used construct Zika, RSV HIV vaccine candidates.1,3-5 finally able get first Maderna shot past Thursday. figured would help one shot far, seeing 80% stat sure makes feel better. Still wearing mask though, even second dose! Ontario government made pretty clear they‚Äôre going rely vaccinations get hole messed actually giving them. many health units sitting 80+ group moving lower everyone gotten dose yet hence unfilled appointments. many groups subdivided point it‚Äôll take long move next one. top appointments booked day it‚Äôs enough make headway, it‚Äôs hundred people here, hundred etc. expect get lot hostility this, job communicate data takes turn upwards, i.e. tell us truth. would pretty unfortunate substantial spike vulnerable people still seeking/waiting turn vaccinated. less 6 weeks away folks vaccinated!  saying listen sympathize concern. wide berth concern teary-eyed message regarding ""impending doom"" point time. lockdown fetish lot strange. purposely said that, left vaccine factor. 

What deal people? curious. love living government boot? suggestion say, fuck it? Here‚Äôs thing, it‚Äôs easier say move lack empathy affected COVID deaths could prevented. 

I get can‚Äôt control people, certainly get reason understand reality situation. 

Though new round cases may young, lose lives live permanent damage COVID cause bodies. AZ. lot people don‚Äôt care anymore , especially mixed messaging. Ducey lifted mask mandates highway signs say ‚Äú MaskUpAZ‚Äù. Forever ever? braggart! think states near me, seem require residency. NYC locations even require city residency, state residency. Staten Island New Yorkers train become Floridians. I've seen people r/collapse posting subs things never getting back normal continue see stronger strains like seeing. Also flu shots suppose everyone, every year, again, multiple strains.  see surviving crime. 

Nothing OC said actually reflects strawman. Using organized crime bosses example doesn‚Äôt help argument much, either. SA Brazil variants still relatively rare US, no? UK variant fairly widespread, course variants equal. course also several variants, see variants-of-concern due lacking specific multitude mutations. trace genetics way beginning determine bat variety given relatedness. help take care immunocompromised mother. live two people helps keep sane. curbside pickup groceries. mom got first shot couple weeks ago relax bit soon.

Edit: Oh yeah gone nuts. Haha Test Trace orders magnitude bigger app. Mostly 1+ million tests conducted daily. Stay inside forever, suits Don‚Äôt tell sub Basement dwellers shambles seem absolutely insane midst losing 2,000-3,000 people per day, every hospital, clinic, pharmacy country begging doses, way 50% vaccines already delivered sitting federal warehouse, held back 4-6 weeks people first doses could get second doses later on. 

Even actually committing first-dose-only strategy, seemed like worst possible idea commit specifically second-dose-at-all-costs strategy. 

The goal prevent 90+% noticeable sickness, prevent detectable disease small percentage population, prevent death largest possible percentage population. Clearly, (in hindsight admit) first-dose priority best way limited supply. Thanks thoughts :) suggestions options across spectrum, perfect answer generally lot guesswork variety biased sources, could worth look you‚Äôre interested though it‚Äôs bit rabbit hole. CEO Pascal Soriot made argument U.K. better vaccine supply U.K. signed agreement vaccines months earlier EU. Formally, isn‚Äôt true: U.K. contract signed August 28, EU‚Äôs signed day earlier August 27. key lies earlier agreement AstraZeneca made back May U.K., binding deal establishing ‚Äúthe development dedicated supply chain U.K.,‚Äù AstraZeneca spokesperson official close U.K. contract said agreement began email April U.K. government saying would provide ¬£65 million help University Oxford execute production plan. later evolved fully-fledged contract government British-Swedish company, also might explain took August contract WFH people well, understand though. lot lose. really ramped vaccinations recently, takes time vaccines provide protection point even people die end life changing lung damage such. Ultra marathoners suddenly can't walk stairs may never able again. great news. hope first many vaccines send Mexico friends American hemisphere. many countries seemed forget 200+ years vaccine science look back on. 

Some things assumed relative certainty, based existing knowledge have. 

So many people countries seemingly acting like COVID vaccine first vaccine world ever seen. 

The reason many vaccine producers 3 week gap double dose regime would optimal dosing strategy. time sensitive issue, needed get vaccines arms ASAP. Every day wasted, tens thousands dead. 

So picked two doses (a common way make sure get immune response want) picked 3 weeks (the shortest time still likelihood working intended).. 

They basically set trials best chance 'okay' performance. honing dosing effective, needed effective enough quick. 

Some companies (J&amp;J) gambled fact second dose even needed. J&amp;J use basically exact tech Oxford vaccine figured 'Fuck it, probably actually need second dose given know vaccines' right. 

So little foresight, drawing previous scientific knowledge, really much gamble all. 

And like person says, unfortunate chance vaccine works vastly different ones we've made before..

Well, still gave people protection 12 weeks. 

Then second dose them, 3rd dose 3 weeks per phase 3 trials. 

Small risk, huuuuuge gain. Thanks! food scene worth mentioning? Important note measure symptomatic asymptomatic infection. Healthcare workers tested weekly irregardless vaccination status. Asymptomatic wasn‚Äôt studied trials it‚Äôs excellent news vaccines 95% effective preventing symptomatic illness, 90% effective preventing asymptomatic. 

This echos UK seen. forgot this:

 clear, study interpreted evidence social distancing behaviors effective. Many people already changed behaviors introduction shelter-in-place orders, shelter-in-place orders appear ineffective precisely meaningfully alter social distancing behavior. always vocal minority pushing policies like ""hunker mask even vaccine!"". people wait everyone around decides right thing go it. hardcore ""you're killing grandma dine out!"" supporters know suddenly flying Florida, asking shows going happen again. think regardless telling people hunker down, witnessing social end pandemic. Historically seems precede medical end situations like this. much want push cases surging, going much pull people get shot, deaths hospitalizations continue decline (as previously hard hit regions), living life becomes worth calculated risk. collective sanity It‚Äôs really Daily Threads, tho. go posts here, it‚Äôs fine. reddit agree you. still cautious over. Within 6 weeks every adult wants first vaccine access it. point, easing appropriate. Easing things bit cases lower also okay. think 'new normal' people really like news Given completely asymptomatic infection rates pretty low population demonstrated study (around 10% here), would imagine previously undiagnosed asymptomatic infections probably rare none. least hospital systems I'm familiar (source: healthcare worker), employees attest regularity fact symptoms coming work. symptoms, test, employees ready access testing. imagine population, previously documented infection fairly reliable measure. get mine today swear anxiety worse last two weeks whole year haha. Totally agree. drama helps anti-vaxx message. people need close work used to, space, privacy, clean air, quiet streets going important. 

We live near urban center, downtown. live working. all. WFH last decade. wife mostly WFH prior move house. 

We like live near attractions, bars, nightlife friends. love walk places. Yes disappeared Covid, already coming back. guess we'll find soon. Depends live. Go scroll bit find state incidence graphs. states top first group appear surging. Michigan particular well way new peak

The worst 6 8 looking pretty shaky. rest either holding obnoxiously high plateau, continuing drop far good shape.

Don't go mini-graphs -- click states better look. Start Got first Pfizer dose morning Maryland. far pain injection site little worse flu shot, nothing terrible. Agreed. Restrictions lifting vaccines readily available everyone boneheaded maneuver. vaccinations help everyone who's eligible get one, we're bigger world hurt. right vaxxed?

If not, expected.... Especially spring break, states relaxing mandates etc. like map states fully open less 10 are, include CA, major reasons cases going down.

American I'm scared us - I'm sad people can't wait weeks get vaccinated return normalcy. Quebec 50% people 70-79 vaccinated, 75% vaccinated made appointment.


i understand vaccines schools require deadly contagious. contagious.

Also there‚Äôs plenty medical religious exemptions. concern too. message positive pro-vac dose reality. crying doom simply don‚Äôt hear anymore. think comparing 2 doses 1 this, need come say it.

Otherwise, no. complying. *people form rich EUropean countries Damn. That's like science porn! No. varies state. 

Adults New York underlying conditions eligible get vaccinated since February. Arkansas adults underlying conditions eligible 13 days. 

Eligibility doesn‚Äôt mean vaccines actually available area. Depending live may travel actually get vaccine. 

Numerous people traveled 6.5 hours NYC get vaccinated. Choctaw Osage Tribal Nations vaccinated members public Oklahoma, Kansas, Arkansas, Texas. 

People live someone high risk also opportunity get vaccinated prior states dropping restrictions including mask mandates. uK ordered even more. took big L Sanofi throw baby bathwater EU doing. Even AZ, UK received less share percentage orders EU see publicly berating AZ. Johnson Johnson even giving vaccines UK even though UK ordered earlier keeping quiet.

Now Novavax refusing even sign contract EU knows EU publicly humiliate can't deliver time.

Tldr: uk also suffering delays vaccine deliveries planned better. [""Neocon"" right whatever reason, anti-mitigation people taken over. guess vast majority public content things going reason keep coming sub, left participating likely agenda. Maybe mitigation policies political too. try smart comments removed. 

There also some, far fewer former, live worst stereotypes former act like prevalent among 100% side, overly pessimistic everything sometimes sounding like want mitigation policies persist long time. also surprising they'd visit sub often average person. Banning travel outside home state would never worked. 

NYC, Chicago tons people commute another state. know self quarantine policies didn‚Äôt apply people worked across state lines. two largest examples think of. Countless others sit near state lines. 

Not mention lack infrastructure ever stop / enforce this. Locking people homes would probably easier stopping interstate travel. also gave nice little pouch first dose! We're saying person's opinion weighted high expert's. That's completely reasonable. hope realise theres nothing outside home can't get online.

God damn dude, might actually saddest comment I've come across reddit. bucks dollars? give ""official"" number deaths ""real"" one 

which strikes absurd. actual government place, say anything ""real"" number? mean matter ""we know sure 100,000 people died COVID; there's another 50,000 died *something* think COVID we're sure, late autopsies them"" say jumped shark months ago. Right around murder wasps.  best, say!

I mean, look world map. See country good us/uk vaccinations apart maybe Chile?

Great strategy guys, thanks. We'll make sure copy next time need something :) Right, mid-March vaccinated everyone else wanted it? Obviously not, that‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt make sense. Well IQ 1.2 would imagine everything sounds dumb you.

even CDC saying fully vaccinated people maskless gather unvaccinated people single household long none unvaccinated people high risk ([When You‚Äôve Fully CDC). months ago ""we need assume vaccinated people still spread get data,"" that's definitely big change suggests believe least significantly reduce spread waiting make judgement much.  I've told enough really get there. coming honestly amount even everyone fully vaccinated still enough people vaccinated wrestle thing ground. People getting continuing get vaccinated short period time threat pretty much Real question effective J&amp;J one shot, go U.K‚Äôs strategy one shot younger population doesn‚Äôt really need 95% efficacy? would imagine CDC access better data random people COVID Denial Subreddit. state license live NYC. long give proof live nyc you‚Äôre fine. showed signed lease also accept W2 paycheck work ny even utility bill/any bill  really bad result AZ. European, surprised though. yup, different points April become open season states getting vaccine - real fun begins real end pandemic US starts :) probably end pretty soon I'm guessing cases crater Brazil variant ravaging country speak. Europe went another surge, far greater previous one. 

I remember last year China Italy getting pummeled Americans gloating everything fine great America affected. I'm seeing scenario played here. even fair reasonable comparison know it. opposite say. It'd like 2/3 population allowed wear seatbelt driving. Risk factor much higher everyone starts wear seatbelt. would drive family around unbuckled wonder got hurt fender bender say acceptable risk want buckle everyone up?

Vaccines fully distributed administered yet. soon is, fine, restrictions lifted else do? shown effective mitigating severe illness hospitalization. people susceptible. mean calculation simple dead vs alive. Obviously observed select countries ages groups point still stands. first half gonna lie. announcement director CDC making god damn nervous I‚Äôm going postpone wedding again. I‚Äôve hopeful June 26th date first time long time. sucks. :( 40% 4/20 seems like smoke celebrate need supply first VR thing. Also pictures. go lad, press. 
PS: Soriot CEO AZ aka guy who's exposed lot shady shit past months. Nah slow states like Maryland Pennsylvania still next year crisis taught us anything, people charge clueless are. Finally. 

I‚Äôm actually excited Biden‚Äôs responding redrawing plans. obvious sites would failure, least quickly pivoted data became available. could see topping around 80% low 80's 65+ group, probably ceiling little lower subsequent age bracket go younger. Ticket master wants see vaccine Watch Vox video vaccine efficacy spreading disinformation.

It effective stopping hospitalisation death. metrics matter. ‚Äúshould‚Äù GA resident, got shot Walgreens didn‚Äôt ask ID. register online use GA address, family/whatever use theirs. imagine can‚Äôt strict people move states don‚Äôt get new license right away.   It‚Äôs infection numbers going think 27 states. small amount, states infection rate going almost five percent day. 

Of course want get vaccinated opening new FEMA sites everywhere new one open twenty miles me

What saying need time people go party maskless like Florida. Like month. guess that‚Äôs much ask. thought problem is. friends using wrong null hypothesis. negative. However ignores vast amount experience says vaccines prevent infection prevent transmission. null 'doesn't'  Got first Moderna shot 3/16. I‚Äôm feeling better. Especially there's clear evidence vaccinated naturally immune people reinfected. realize making mitigation measure people going able sustain right? wording ain't it? starting get annoying. UK seems (weirdly) unaffected CVST, there's 5 cases, plenty under-55s received AZ vaccine. get massively downvoted saying measures continue short-term younger people vaccinated too.  thought EU trying punish UK company Brexit... article pile dog shit. Talk labeling large amount humans basically calling hyenas pack together seek enemies try pester convince otherwise. 

Most anti-vaxxers know educated people well jobs literally want wait bit don‚Äôt feel comfortable taking vaccine. doesn‚Äôt mean people evil. Ummm..except 1000 Americans still dying daily probably expected J&amp;J work exceedingly well given mRNA vaccine, work well type vaccine one-dose vaccine.

I'm J&amp;J trial got unblinded days ago (I'm fully vaccinated!) understand concerns. Here's paper J&amp;J shot transmission: little longer kick mRNA vaccines, still pretty good news. PA still 1a?! thought Virginia dragging feet- good Lord! Philadelphia, general population already get vaccination convention center walk-in. line pretty long may tell come back another day, plenty young people getting shots. trying administer many people possible It‚Äôs dead Jim. No...im saying people shitty pro-mitigation mean someone can't shitty.

The problem people verbally attacking others likely fear yes, still excuse behavior. can't acknowledge that? say same? want people treated peoples trying go work get horribly think they're hook. Stop making excuse behavior, one making excuse anti-maskers either, says lot someone thinks harassment employees go work bar/restaurant open want paycheck justified. Don‚Äôt laminate legal docs people expand that? I‚Äôm confused. Agreed.

The part find ironically hilarious, watch coverage China's system, enforcing make statements much everyone loves system, leaving important fact people speak system penalized. Absolutely insane. think expansions paused appropriate, rollbacks. data back almost vaccinations help curb rise, behind everyone else getting them

? might shocked learn nobody cares. one lied. understood difference airborne virus one attaches moisture, know information known Fauci said said masks. New information gathered, new guidelines communicated. would go later say US government held promoting face masks knew shortages bad even doctors get enough. 

&amp;#x200B;

..and 100% correct administration charge pandemic relief completely dropped ball one. Living near job likely huge reason. Many friends live city still 30-45 minute commute via trains busses workplace city, lived city bars, clubs, nightlife, around young people, dating, etc. makes think Florida's death counts inaccurate?  case numbers rising would need lockdowns prevent going control.

If case numbers steady need lockdowns prevent rising.

And case numbers falling proves lockdowns worked.

Is there, mind, scenario lockdowns *aren't* solution?

It's end flu season brought rate low. Positive cases younger people rose started large scale testing younger people returned school. That's mostly lockdown. high vaccination rate helping really carried hard lockdown. thought thing  introverts, anti-social shut-ins. 

I'm introvert, means recharge alone. like go people watch coffee shop. like going office separation work home. like taking classes person (selectively) socializing conferences. Introvert equal anti-social. 25 BMI makes like 70 percent Americans eligible embarrassingly bad job everything, honestly

&amp;#x200B;

save couple great journalists there, media machine talking head garbage Fair certain states, appointments come rarely website perpetually scraping send text appointment instead refresh page. Hopefully it'll hour ish.  American people 

Oh man.  sides hurt.  üòÜ instead pushed people much harder start (e.g. much harder, shorter lockdown), employed successful mass testing/contact tracing program, really could moved needle. Asking individuals ""do better"" effective scenario.

That exactly it. Four weeks incredibly strict lockdown much effective every way endless weeks half-measures. assume read becuase typed that. google becuase posted reddit. think could combine resources learn vaccines work differently cure confusion! (And 66% effective vaccine also valuable...) states really vaccinating people. Pennsylvania better job prioritizing actually high risk. 

Many states opening anyway elderly people cannot figure get shot. still technically supply issues. shots reserved first shot anyone 50 next month. worry second shots may. let six week thing make eight weeks (or 30 come back unless feel need it). saying people repeatedly ignored warnings pretended like everything rosy fine. like majority sub right now. really give link Google? Dick move. deaths hospitalizations significantly lower flu vaccinated. people fail realize important 95% effective vaccine versus 50% effective vaccine means real world. 95% effective vaccine means game Honestly, late higher ups anything. narrative burned ground. People live life. primary campaign lmao, right beginning. 2015. younger people showing much sicker need medical attention before

Source this? Honestly stress it, may enjoyable two weeks pass anyway. Sorry losses. Take time need feel comfortable you‚Äôre doing. Better CDC director. wedding 50 people outdoors middle June PA. going full steam ahead, wedding party vaccinated risk folks too. fine. April going look different May going even better, truly believe this. problem people scared. complete opposite infact. Far many people taking seriously. Sadly going find nasty variants first hand USA.

UK zero deaths first time 6 months, bunch variants. Come people. We're final stretch. wanna grill 4th friends. Damn. long J&amp;J stored opening vial? know major concern walk-ins mRNA vaccines spoil pretty quickly opening, one person showed would lead lot wasted vaccines. J&amp;J used days, logistics lot easier. No, shared medical history women. Germany, one hospital stopped vaccinating women 55 overweight, hypertension take contraceptives. Thanks sharing that. tried registering VA care weeks ago rejected I‚Äôm income threshold. thing keep mind vaccine free issue needing registered could otherwise show Safeway huge miss VA signal competent organization. 

I called number shared Friday morning told would take least another week clear issues billing system. asked put calendar 2 3 weeks scheduling wouldn‚Äôt become next bottleneck wouldn‚Äôt either. I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôll get shot someplace VA first little disappointing. wish Biden hadn‚Äôt done way instead released VA‚Äôs allocation standard delivery channels means we‚Äôve allocated valuable doses sit around knows long instead giving Rite Aid Walgreens. lol what

That's response? Sigh...

Cuomo answer sins since New Yorkers actually care. referring numbers. GA allow it, believe South Carolina Alabama want visit drive little bit. Thank you. I'm going bring see hematologist two weeks. thinks worth it, I'll let handle reporting. 2-3/5 ""allergic reaction"" symptoms listed info packet, none (individually together) bad enough count severe impede breathing. I'm torn wondering mild allergic reaction, I'm paranoid year pandemic anxiety. I‚Äôve Covid didn‚Äôt spread anybody isolated came it. Sure I‚Äôm murderer though don‚Äôt believe shame people social we‚Äôre dealing virus survival rate we‚Äôll 99%. probably think us immunity continue living hermits though. People reddit understand landlord do-nothing job. probably people think renting throwing money away every month instead paying mortgage (hint: there's tradeoffs like everything life). Let google wanted convey ""with raw force"". say ""vaccinated people 80 percent lower chance get sick"" ""80 percent less people vaccinated population get sick""?  Interesting. wonder if, whatever reason, Kroger found isolated incident. didn‚Äôt get turned away literally walked in, got shot, walked matter minutes line wait.

Perhaps fluke day specific Kroger area really doesn‚Äôt vaccine demand. people introverts, anti social mere thought awful lifestyles fall style unfathomable. get entire adult population next weeks focus first shot - ending US epidemic May 1 rather June 1. matters. observation, like consider multiple angles issue almost people forget here.

They worry health people, economy politics top consider people react decision. ie help say people can't go 4pm way enforce and/or way encourage people go out. 

You can't ignore one simple solutions really never option here. Wait know this... diamond hands?  curiosity, notice fewer colds social distancing protocols place? little kids pretty much got colds back back school, I‚Äôm wondering that‚Äôs going look like fall... I‚Äôm assuming lots covid tests üò¨ Thanks makes bit sense get numbers efficacy, though 0.04/1000 perso-days full immunization vs 1.38/1000 person-days unimmunized, would still arrive .04/1.38(\*100 for%) = 2.9% people infected per person-day full immunization vs immunization (97% ish effective). guess also comes define ""effective"", person-day seems like good metric, could imagine others. matter look it, study great news! proof vaccine works well relieved hear this. got sick covid march 2020 strong reaction first shot. Here's hoping means I'm closer immunity. I'm sure grammar place, I'm sorry butchering it. 

English first language, never attended English speaking school. Switzerland

Switzerland approved AZ yet. said long back already would wait results US trial (which recently finished). picked side ongoing AZ saga. 10000% this.  

If deaths (and serious consequences) roughly comparable flu we're truly side.  think inevitability. Probably within next 2-3 weeks. upfront. issue younger people showing much sicker need medical attention before, seen country (Canada) lock-downs occurring again, well Europe South America. relative mine knows people largest hospital apparently they've never seen many people 30-40s sick, compared first wave basically 70+. volunteer vaccine clinic US found gave j&amp;j second dose patient last week. We've given Moderna, Pfizer J&amp;J since January different vaccines become logistical nightmare follow shots. variant threat going manifest, would expect see localized explosions cases somewhere first. I'm watching news every day. far big decline weeks weeks.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*   Um, no...I‚Äôm almost fully vaccinated I‚Äôm still social distancing, staying home, wearing mask. I‚Äôm still listening guidelines. 

The CDC losing creditability statements like this. Vaccinations US going extremely well point we‚Äôre going surplus vaccines. Instead hyperbolic alarmist statements like - serve frighten depress people - encouraging people get vaccinated soon possible. Statements like make people feel though vaccines don‚Äôt matter we‚Äôll pandemic forever. 

The people partying Florida aren‚Äôt going stop CDC director crying tv. spread stops herd immunity reached. vaccines happening, focus: get people vaccinated.

No one‚Äôs saying CDC pretend everything‚Äôs a-OK. It‚Äôs fine warn people rising cases. approach hyperbolic extremely pessimistic celebrating vaccines encouraging everyone get shot. quite frankly, it‚Äôs irresponsible. empathy? mean people partying Miami today?

Over last year understand much sub thinks control lives others. Obviously can't. Well bad title indicated. fact combined scientific (physician related anecdotes) emotional appeal may effective messaging. 

She scared cause control..but scared see agonizing unwarranted deaths hospitals patients families suffering...is take.   presupposes Americans liars frauds, true. far people continue act self interest, wear mask social distance avoid getting sick. won't, frankly people already skirting rules makes difference. 

But leaders scientists telling absolute truth right now, hedging trying hand social engineering. I'm smoking bathroom school. I'm spending time family friends.  numbers lie fully vaccinated

Whilst two doses course better one, two doses represents full vaccination course, think also important remember there's thing fully vaccinated sense vaccination (even doses) mean 100% protected.

I imagine know that, think worth emphasising given choice language. Great! golden :) especially study results came today showing 80% protection, 2 weeks FIRST dose!

I'm even sure I'd ask people vaccinated attend unless required venue--up family decide though. Everyone ample time get 1 shot + 2 weeks date monkey doesn‚Äôt bananas. can‚Äôt give bananas. Unless buys margin. need stop reading news. bored like knowing whats going on. Ill fully vaccinated birthday least thats cool. talk impending doom starting get little bit old tbh. going hard adjust back looking people anything big babies dressed business casual. least sweet sweet job communicating confused twenty-somethings writing professional emails back forth. shit day today cant tell lolol supposed drink wearing mask? Even I'm not, pretty uncomfortable. like going concerts go, masks mandatory. 90% effective infection they‚Äôd shouting rooftops. feeling ""cutting line"" this: 

1) public good vaccinated. 

2) lack super clearly articulated implemented national state strategy OK decide balance personal risk/noblesse oblige want engage in. ok personal ethics bend rules nobody care/judge you.  need get shots arms quickly possible. 

My wife technically eligible NYC bit held due ethical honestly scheduling issues. announced we'd 100% legit went ahead booked. 

If feeling queasy look either volunteering and/or waitlists. That's entirely true UK, far I'm aware, half vaccine supply made UK sent Europe. statistic recently 29 million doses sent Italy alone essentially wasted, whilst 29 million less many UK used totally. Since time last spring millions people decided longer afraid COVID.

Let's go perspective someone bare minimum complying COVID restrictions since last summer. wear mask required, absolutely nothing that, amount people place they're going even factor, refuse stay home safety safety others, constantly socialize private.

Millions people year now, lot never even caught COVID. they're told take vaccine likely knock asses 1-2 days protect disease they've never felt needed protection first place, continue following restrictions they're currently dealing with, expect it?

You cannot operate assumption everyone feels you. cannot operate assumption everyone smart right thing. fail recognize *millions* people like described above, America's vaccine effort stall prematurely. solution vaccine passports mandatory vaccines. *encouraging* people get vaccinate providing incentive resonate people. Anyone taken beginner-level psychology course know encouragement works better punishment. say? going issue big ignore. Germany 2.6 million people vaccinated AstraZeneca, vast majority 65. time EMA another meeting next week, 4 million Germans vaccinated. least that's amount people can't ignore. many health workers. Would downright cruel leave hanging. Zero Covid clearly goal people now. It‚Äôs flattening curve keeping hospitals overrun. Lol think know civil liberty is. mom, tried Kroger, Rite-Aid, Meijer, Health Dept, even Walgreens Walmart (who offering last time checked). Every day couple weeks least, spent time trying nab spot, never anything. Finally got Kroger appt. cancelled day said overbooked. Finally got county health department couple days ago. Also finally got mine scheduled county health department well.

But took dedication find one travel (if went Kroger). Many people bother that. They'll wait one places signed contact them. Increased body temperature often causes increased heart rate. It‚Äôs probably nothing worry about. Flulike symptoms aching isn‚Äôt uncommon, subside. Assuming bride, day you. 

Don't let others opinions hold much water. choose extra precautious wish remain isolated post-vaccination, choice free make. 

However, science data proven effective vaccines are. side coin, choice take data decide moving forward life makes sense you, others judge shame for. data efficacy changes day-by-day first injection? curve look like? Science 'wrong' lot. Yes. However, proven wrong (better yet, new knowledge attained), build it, learn it, work new knowledge they've learned.

You know, adults. average infected person spreads covid 2 people. average vaccinated person spread covid .1 people. enough sustain itself. 

Vaccine changed everything social distancing. recommend sick day can. woke following day shot # 1 Moderna feeling fine save sore arm. Shot # 2 still feeling weather following day. Body aches, slightly elevated body temp, well general sluggishness. sore arm though. second day shot felt 90% could worked needed (it Sunday though luckily). People seem believe lab escape theory. However, people r/virology still buying it. Close-ish! islands south Manhattan, Staten Island down. didn't. thought car analogy relation covid. could plan to. got though, there's chance wake tomorrow sore reaction. Also chance wake tomorrow feel great. 

I babied last week. shoulder sore lift shoulders/chest weekend.  Yeah still cannot mentally grasp logic J&amp;J even existing option. 

It‚Äôs 66% effective.  Period. 

And it‚Äôs one shot. .... heyyy ... two shots then?

Nope.  J&amp;J one shot.  Why?  

Who knows ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Pfizer?  Estimations 80-85% effective one shot. 

But Pfizer two shot vaccine. 

Why?  

Who knows?ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Apparently get Pfizer def wanna hit 95% second shot. 

But get J&amp;J rest easy knowing protection level dog shit.  

Color confused.  Republicans always hate government regulation, business something don‚Äôt like. regulate fast it‚Äôll make head spin. Again, Ireland. Euro Ireland. Euro Yeah I'm really sure shitty sentiment getting upvotes.

I agree you. course caution warranted, situation changing day day everyone. throwing precaution wind got full vaccine dangerous also community. 

As aside, even get total ""we totally 100 percent it, go back normal"" I'm still gonna wear mask large gatherings. cold 13 months that's pretty awesome. Yep. totally get wearing masks indoors ""herd immunity"" met. pandemic even think great idea wear masks indoors someone someone sick. dumbest thing ever forced wear mask 90+ degree weather visiting farm child.... people 15+ feet away. stats refer populations, individuals. Unfortunately, makes difficult people intuitively understand numbers mean. Lockdowns don‚Äôt work states anyone drive different state. feels like lockdown almost nothing slow transmission.

If people afraid shop, economy suffers. Lockdowns, done right, lower transmission virus dramatically make people safer normal things.

And mental health? What‚Äôs worse mental health: stuck inside month losing parent/grandparent? United States locked correctly February mid March 2020, economy would suffering badly currently is. Hundreds thousands people would currently alive. 

Children got fucking orphaned United States‚Äô failure nationally lockdown first wave.  fair original covid strain still common US, reduction efficacy 95% trial 90% study may be, least partly, related variants. Iceland banned 70, Finland banned 65, Denmark still suspended, Norway suspended Read user name please, hurt feelings. even news isn‚Äôt good, people want hear, best way deliver public health official crying warning doom? mean, impending doom level extension event doesn‚Äôt happen people listen even less next time someone warns ‚Äúimpending doom‚Äù. happens addicted bad news. try see bad new everything. somebody personally favor UBI, tell making awful case. mean I'm scaredy cat I'll waiting til 2nd anything recreational indoors eases overall worries. I'm still working person many unvaccinated want see young nephew bday next month mind extra careful little longer! still completely banned Denmark Norway. Finland Sweden still 65+. Probably others. almost like Fauci admitted lying masks. Oh wait, actually happened. dropped ball one dude. messaging maintaining nearly mitigation efforts *even vaccinated* driving people away getting jab.  really dawned website *filled* introverts. region-specific subs, idea eventually sending workers back office good local economy insane people.
