I’ve never met CanSino recipient though. got Sinovac, mum, dad brother too. sister got Pfizer she’ll receive second dose next week. sister became excellent source 5G vaccine 😆 know RSV (another respiratory illness) also seeing huge uptick spread. I'm familiar specifics symptoms, possible contracted instead.   He's basically admitted much, saying things like takes full responsibility executive orders (as opposed many politicians, regardless party affiliation, take responsibility absolutely nothing). mean, agree him. Wokesters woke end hurting people claim helping. people still doubt whether COVID-19 exists smh    dunno, state abysmally low vaccination rates 12-15 street dogs Canada, except north historically kept case hunger. 

Nor US street dogs.

Do want government housing renters? sounds like urban hell. Really numbers look way many going hospital. less people went doctor, we'd less cases. reason fake numbers seem high  isn’t. Guys, articles need linked better headlines. lot “may” “it’s early” article say flat statement. Here’s quote article, “I’m trying understand whether virus accelerates pre-existing condition, causes new Alzheimer’s-like process begin progress, behaves fixed problem completely recover,” said. “We don’t know yet.” There’s statement 3 different possibilities one includes possibility full recovery. know disease bad can’t continually state things fact actual statements article lot more

He's saying another way exclude minorities.  ""Your request get Heaven answered order received."" country 100 Delta cases since May 2021 managed keep total cases less 10,000 day. However granular lockdowns imposed keep numbers lower.

With fast Delta supposed though, believe majority cases Delta anyway. genome sequencing country slow. Thankfully, we're ramping vaccination effort (Sinovac, J&amp;J, Pfizer, Moderna here) thankfully blowing numbers like US UK did.

Just background: rural areas, masks heavily mandated miracle cases blow up.  seems insane me, since idiots excellent chance infecting residents virus may kill them.     don’t realize rights constrained infringe others peoples rights.  right life. Can’t yell fire crowded theater. Can’t point gun another person even though right bear arms.  Can’t go 100mph freeway even though right freely travel. can’t infect people get thrown jail like Typhoid Mary. Rights aren’t absolute. actually saw article Oklahoma hospitals getting hit hard RSV kids. didn’t much Flu season last year either. 

I’m concerned children’s hospitalization COVID. Especially many schools opening full capacity masks, RSV, Flu Delta floating around air. end let's real risks kids COVID 

Delta significantly dangerous kids prior variants. makes confident next mutation even heart, spouse vaccinated risks family extraordinarily low now.

You go ahead let guard down. I'll keep everything keep kids safe. don’t know made racial thing know full well anti-vax sentiments stretch across racial ethnic groups. I’m calling 50% *America* idiots, obviously excluding people can’t get vaccines right now.    following occupation sectors heavily hit Colorado:

* Construction
* Transportation
* Sales/Retail
* Office/Clerical
* ""Homemaker, volunteer, student""
* ""Retired, disabled, non-worker""

The following sectors got lightest reported data:

* Military
* Farming/Fishing/Forestry
* Legal occupations
* Life, physical, social science occupations  state virtual public school available require half day week person group 10-20 kids small classroom mask requirements. Defeats purpose reasoning.  funny. 

considering 300+ mass shootings far year, unusual conditions, think pretty good chance occuring. Everyone UK parts ireland.  [4,256,952 fully vaccinated 8,000 cases means 99.82% fully vaccinated residents breakthrough case.

While math seems every fully vaccinated residents tests positive virus, way CDC recently calculated 99% vaccinated Americans breakthrough cases.  Plan? plan? it! countries require it. vax pass. Let's finish   know say men created equal, look look Samoa Joe see statement true. See, normally go one one another wrestler, got 50/50 chance winning. I'm genetic freak I'm normal! got 25%, BEST, beat me. add Kurt Angle mix, chances winning drastic go down. See 3 way, Sacrifice, got 33 1/3 chance winning, I, got 66 2/3 chance winning, Kurt Angle KNOWS can't beat he's even gonna try!

So Samoa Joe, take 33 1/3 chance, minus 25% chance got 8 1/3 chance winning Sacrifice. take 75% chance winning, go one one, add 66 2/3 per cents, got 141 2/3 chance winning Sacrifice. See Joe, numbers lie, spell disaster Sacrifice.    data outdated, probably 90% now.  probably won’t get heavily enforced many scenarios, ideally announcement spur action give restaurants locations cover enforcing want to. It’s lot easier point government mandate corporate policy. Vaccine passports happen areas. Politically hot potato Exactly! Impressive btw! Kudos vaccineS used (Sinovac, Pfizer, Astra) Chileans!

In another note, siNovAc BaD, supposed take chances wait ""impRessIve, perfEct"" mRNA vaccines maybe die process get hit Covid?

Here country, majority mRNA vaccines donated US I'm thankful vaccines purchased?? Pfizer/Moderna, maybe provide timelines countries UK/US/Canada get golden mRNA vaccines? seems right. all, masks came cases still plummeted almost two months. CDC guidance correct alpha world. sucks Delta causing us reevaluate.   “She wants use condom?!? That’s **discrimination**!!!”

Yes. It’s absolutely ok assume everyone contagious. 

That’s entire point disease prevention curbing contagion. 

That’s restaurant workers required wash hands. Heath Board assumes hepatitis don’t want you, diner, get hepatitis. SC governor: Hold beer remember kind nothingburger.    I’m got autoimmune disorders, partner prof. UT aren’t letting classes virtual, less full capacity, distanced, masked. I’m honestly preparing fact might die next three months.   **Yes**. That’s curbing contagion works. 

Didn’t safer sex class? That’s first thing teach. 



Or always bareback strange men one contagious without proof?  can’t deny citizen re-entry home nation home nations government.

Australia: Well, hello question. Walmart even making effort lead this? Or, afraid backlash? Israel another lockdown though. masks vaccine passports. Sorry hear. incredibly frustrating painful see.  Good What’s line shrek, “some die, that’s risk I’m willing take” Florida also send kids school maskless   Isn’t businesses verify vaccination status? Private businesses simply deny entry, reason (“No shirt, shoes, service” example). could simply let people in. 

It would cool would require verification State databases, either QR code, someone presents physical card, instant verification. seems pie sky, again, Hawaii managed set pretty robust verification program visitors, I’m least little bit hopeful L.A. would able pull something similar. Yeah hate Israel remember? Supposedly think 39% number wrong I'm waiting official revision.  Here’s thought, universities make acceptance verified science requirement graduation. like this, fake cards easy get . technical solution way. would never happen. wish could help. 🇨🇦 anyone else noticed Google let select Florida searching ""Covid cases""? specifically search google ""Florida covid cases"" view chart &amp; data. 2020: “Why masks politicized?”

2021: “I wear mask people don’t think I’m elephant team.” However Dr. said another RSV type virus hitting lot people right now.

What’s about? I’ve sick 101-102° fever 6 days honestly feel worse COVID. flabbergasted whatever *isn’t* COVID.  Great idea track breakthrough cases.

Since breakthrough cases appear asymptomatic, real way track them.

You can't test everyone symptoms. go UK, Belfast take train/bus down. virus created wipe older un healthy adults. children, even communist evil doers still soft spot kids. basic forms life exhibit signs self preservation.  hypoxia seem similar issues people sleep apnea.

No.... COVID's case there's actual brain swelling. anosmia/dysgeusia thing due swelling.  refering mutations spike binder, immunity whole. absolutely correct general immunity.  Sovcit Singapore. 

It begins arguing admiralty flags ends caned ass. remember seeing couple memes that's got radar, think people repurposing Christmas decorations haha. That's rough. Grandma passed vaccine available first wave last April (non-covid related) dementia idea going through. Wishing family best. Whose winning Texas Florida? Exactly. I'm waiting Delta Nu worthy investment?

Let's check back two years. worth it? also docking mechanisms may auxiliary may actually secondary to/independent spike protein. Here's one recent example Also drunk driver go jail recovers. People mask get vaccine freely. Ummm heard HIV? bears? Oh my!  wonder point common sense prevail Abbott DeSantis enact measures keep people safe?

Right it’s one big free-for-all schools starting masks vaccines. fucking Google see animal shelters full adoptable abandoned dogs Winnipeg? End game = tithing.  Fuuuuuuudge… Michigan ICU nurse here… waiting surge. happy it, one bit :/    title post riddle itself. Adding that, [no major religion opposes Pretty much. Nowadays Christmas starts Halloween Halloween prep starts 4th July.

Also hotels. hotels require show checking imagine lions tigers antivax lol ones right thing socially distanced, masked got vaccinated tired. Especially delta variant poses spread even vaccinated. selfish pricks die care. wish die, give single solitary shit.

People limit compassion. year half compassion run out. testing 3x week let's see still want stay unvaccinated.  mass produce provide everyone free? Duh... patient advised get vaccine severe allergic reactions? they're eligible they're young? they're teenager forbidden getting shot conservative parents? developmental disability unable make decisions sort, guardian bother?

Better draw line anywhere. try pick choose draw line, get sued. Raleigh man vs Florida man, wins? can’t stand people say stupid shit like “it doesn’t really affect kids.” hell?? don’t clue thing capable yet. I’m still keep kids getting sick. aren’t old enough get vaccinated honestly don’t know much that’s going help. yet know vaccinated people break cases end long term effects?? last two guys massive dipshit governors got president secretary energy shit.

He's developing resume run. He's using state audition.  Yep. feels hopeless ever. Things good while, got chair kicked us again. got patient awake pieces first. Made OR, died. later asked medically clear killer. Honestly? never know. Covid obligation stop mutating become less infectious/vaccine resistant.  I’m going area 2 weeks. things going?

Where live (Canada) stray dogs outside northern communities. dogs serve purpose really compaionship. 


I live Nicaragua 4 years working program spayed neutered street dogs, post history prove it. 

In world people would living concrete blocks instead homes, waiting list perhaps somewhat feral dog shipped overseas instead home companion. would say feeling? mild symptoms asymptomatic?  got Disney help install FastPass queues? You’re right cdc fucked up. fucked recommending cloth masks opposed n95s. Studies show cloth masks next nothing, encourage people within close proximity. They’ve lied people don’t buy n95s (which reserved health care workers - rightly so). Instead truthful, provided healthcare workers, ramped production masks actually work. Ask Florida theory working them.    Situations like help bring valid question what’s decent messaging convince people still asymptomatic testing post-vaccine?

While testing definitely save lives, I’m denying that, feels like push testing two things: 

a) convince good amount vaccinated people shot changes nothing still basically behave like it’s second half 2020. piss good amount vaccinated people. 

and 

b) undermine vaccination efforts. unvaccinated people see vaccinated people getting tested, it’ll reinforce stance “what’s point?” won’t get line shot. sub: SAYS GET aren’t getting twice treatment lowered virus numbers. soon got levels raised positive came person South Korea got twice. rare occasions people get SAYS CAN’T GET COVID TWICE. get emergencies people seek medical care emergency due cost barrier treating earlier.  know, like they're battling tobacco, drug, food addiction. Preventing literally takes like ten minutes. vax rates much higher Delta would less non issue. We'd likely case spike mild cases it'd drop. Like UK. Compare hospitalizations though? Soooo fewer. Every. Single. Fucking. Person. told us ‘live it’. Can. Fucking. Fuck. Themselves. They’re eugenist extra steps. Ethics isn’t binary. unethical let people something prevent unforced error death receiving treatment someone neglected solved problem? risk unless place pretty much empty. much chance virus continuing spread way people masks confined space extended period. daughter tested positive show symptoms? think jury still serious symptoms people vaccinated test positive.

Yup... really apply rule USA. UK well double vaccinate 70%+ adult population. We're even close yet... NYC LA County still 55%\~ fully vaccinated.

LA currently (hospital-wise) probably spared bc pretty much middle class higher vaccinated. However, big problem underserved minority communities there.  Cdc trust issues past... incorrect. lot ways COVID evade immunity nothing shape spike protein ability enter cells.

Opps. Man, reading reminds much much suck nurses doctors right knew would come take it. Well, aren’t going take leave, could blame them? Sure took oath, end day, can’t help don’t want helped.

I'm confused. Could elaborate little please? Give week two. They're gearing up.  big difference 20,000 600,000 1 million people. downvoted suggesting something like awhile back. I’m much worried others may infect. parents still sick, mom achy sore throat dad currently hospital recovering well. see home know siblings first got infected properly quarantined within house.  i'm glad gullibility accounted epidemiological model. I'm trying convince mom get vaccine. says someone works ""knows someone heart problems receiving vaccine"" ""the doctors could attribute vaccine"". I'm sure bunch shit, research adverse effects vaccine aside immediate reactions? I'm afraid search would probably lead rabbit hole misinformation.

I guess would take $5 10k. money. Right? Lol association loss smell hinted even pandemic, 2018 suspicious statistics, 1 child sick last week there's 4? X00% increase!? Well yes no.

At time, issue vax people potentially contagious thing.

And delta contagious kept wearing masks last 2 months, think we'd still similar place.

Why? massive case rise last winter primarily fueled indoor maskless gatherings, even many rule followers got fatigued.

So vax people would wear masks stores wear elsewhere could rightfully return normal activities.

And non vaxed would reluctantly still wear stores continue normal activities like they've since May 2020.

Delta would still come thing.

So really blame CDC. know super annoying mixed messages think that's biggest criticism. knowledge time, perhaps realizing big problem antivaxxers would be... think okay decision. Thank you!! &lt;3 Seriously? Meanwhile Arkansas: #FUCK Holy crap look Alaska there, blast off! 🚀 Fauci says fears vaccine-resistant COVID variant could emerge fall.

Is something really need worry about? bad reaction contrast dye concerns vaccine fine! observed 30 minutes, nothing happened. found today nanny lied getting vaccine covid positive direct contact 14 month old son showing symptoms.

I'm angry even know get thoughts together. far son showing signs, help gets sick...

Oh nanny pregnant that's another baby putting risk. read language law allows Emergency Use Authorization, EUA's allowed fully approved alternatives exist. fully approved vaccine supply problems, likely Moderna's would pulled market approval given, submitted vaccine final approval weeks behind Pfizer. J&amp;J might completely they've yet show indication they're going apply final approval, barely used anyway. I’m sure covers entirety I’m asking tbh. Like, vaccine widely available too, still logistical issues vaccinating entire nation, America big. remote places hasn’t reached yet, rolled age, it’s free places demand outweighing supply? 

I’m trying say antivaxxers aren’t issue, course are, optimist doesn’t want believe 30% population doesn’t want get it. That’s really high number blatant data manipulation. anyone took stats 101 knows it. what's constant manipulation? lame This. never ""no pandemic"". Technically, flu pandemic decades now. depressing? anything it’s highly encouraging. We’re talking 8000 cases 100 deaths 4+ million. Yeah mean 50% efficacy puts flu shot levels. would still get. Y’all seen big ass rats run around middle people? baby 😎 vaccines walk anywhere get one age except young going 2 months plus longer. without one want one point  keep using word, it's, awesome. downward trend spoke everything can. responsible situation in. situation make bad doctor. This. don’t know percent vaccinated population actually came contact covid. relevant % quite sure Florida reported. Well, looks like Texas back bullshit again. Shocking. favors left call in

National guard. Again. chiming show wrong. states reported stats 3+ day batches never good use current date 7 day trends. 

We trending downward. Pretty clear Sometimes need vent. Hugs afar. Stay safe! sure someone sick? remotely depressing? I’s highly encouraging factor state 4 million people vaccinated. yeah thats misleading math.  

What took article: ""Those numbers include 34 new breakthrough hospitalizations nine additional deaths among fully vaccinated tracked past week.""

There 36 deaths last week covid, 9 fully vaxxed, 25% covid deaths last week state. good.  mandates take away freedom people make decisions. Albeit may best ones sets bad precedent going forward. it’s republicans, democrats implement laws strip always freedoms set bad precedents. believe people get shot think forced prove go eat buy food restaurant. leads soon prove buy food grocery store on. people allergic physically cannot get shot do? ""representing 0.18% immunized population"" I'm sick shit. means exactly nothing. entire vaccinated population exposed covid? No? Meaningless.

The reality bad news. Exactly, people totally dishonest saying like ""uh yeah promises keep hospital"" fuck dude. celebrating. Breathing anyway.  Re-read maybe... He's (every Republican) opposite Democrats think good idea. Much like apple. new one every 6 months wish could push people get vaccinated forget masks. 

""I wish could airbags need seatbelts"" vaccines widely available here. Texas see Floridas 16,935 raise 19,000. win it! wait till holidays. Compare summer spike last summer extrapolate winter spike. that's vaccinations ongoing. hospital already beds, ICU covid added makeshift ICU beds full started seeing ramp up.

China pursued two pronged approach, Vietnam dropped ball trying secure supply vaccines early. Maybe wanted wait prices came down. Maybe due politics acceptable get vaccines China. Maybe confident thought could maintain zero covid another months bulk vaccines ordered arrived. upshot delta emerged, infectious broke Vietnam's infection control measures.

Obviously delta also stressing China's COVID measures, nonetheless much better shot due many people vaccinated medical/testing resources Vietnam could muster. Probably telling people vaccines work saves lives.

Like, literally that’s thing right, it’s weak fuck. it’s good enough people think he’s fine. turn cyber dongs ventilators talking Kentucky. course pharma paid, get control price. govt negotiates price shots. order free market work, can't single entity controlling supply &amp; price.  see case. states abysmal positivity rates point they're catching half cases (My state, Arkansas, days around 15%). Combine lack masks mandates worst vaccination rates, brutal school session. dont see problem caused unvaccinated people my, vaccinated person's, problem.

No amount mask wearing going prevent ICU beds filling 30% population get vaccinated wear mask. part, made masks march last freaking year wore them, even got vaccinated, till state's mask mandate ended.

After that, blame rests squarely shoulders, mine. Republican leaders wouldn’t even notable didn’t speak sickening, hideous part us seeks selfish inconsiderate anyone’s well own. Society war itself, better people us be, unfortunately looks like we’ve already lost. Casually recommending fourth vaccine dose stranger feels negligent best.   know else unethical? fact people country using vital resources selfishness.  understand go hospital first place, vaccine gives 5g magnet autism whatever current conspiracy is, hospital treatments same? ignore initial advice come help damage done? Look numbers adults.‘they got bit much harder precautions place. Pretty big deal, 110,000 LA County employees. Yep completely correct. Even given that, eradication still immensely challenging. heard shortages vaccine. son abusive home, much put cannot easily get house. 
We able sneak away yesterday hour get vaccine nobody any. Walmart told us Friday. disappointed. 

We live small town able hit two places unprepared saying out. 

The one time actually get away go this. hoping hope get away get it. 

If even say Corona virus get berated. something easily get help with. terrified get ones fall deathly sick (the person 3will fine. Less 1% vaccinated Vietnam. think makes majority anti vaxers, it’s factually correct   Australia rely mostly AstraZeneca vaccines also contracts producers? EU never stopped exporting vaccines, even middle second/third waves. half vaccines produced EU exported.

The US blocked exports ship single dose ""done"" vaccinating own.  
Oh, way India blocked exports too, clear.

But hey, EU bad. EU never stopped exporting vaccines, even middle second/third waves. half vaccines produced EU exported.

The US blocked exports ship single dose ""done"" vaccinating own.  
Oh, way India blocked exports too, clear.

But hey, EU bad.  Anyone experience getting vaccine gear? Particularly testosterone anavar? resources send way? city finally allowing possibly get vaccinated month, supplies don’t run out.

I’m young healthy (no medical conditions) male, upper 20’s. walk away also leave behind fully vaccinated people contract disease. might responsible strain system, affected decision well protect people virus kills 3% people according official statistics? National database nonsense CDC guidance anything signed US (so Pfizer, Moderna, AZ good go) mad people forced over-reactive measures disease kills 3% people infects, mostly elderly, obese, diabetic, immune compromised, people rare gene makes susceptible covid-19 age healthy. mad forced measures you. mad people maths, look statistics, decided event bad, fact pales comparison things deal every day like cancer, heart disease, etc. every country adopts policy effect same.

I worked Nigeria while, needed whole list jabs allowed in, see things different covid. 1.2% CFR looks awful lot like CFR original COVID unvaccinated. question asked:

""Is zero covid cases viable strategy?""  Let run rampant get high vaccination rate let hundreds thousands people die. 

It'll sweet bro! Worked really well overseas - loads experts tell it... 3% deathrate, maximum number people could die WORLDWIDE covid-19 around 23 million. comparison, 17.9 million people die worldwide EVERY YEAR heart disease. nightmare virus, overreactive measures implemented governments. end stop subject fear inducing news media. Simple. I've found [a paper published China CDC](http://weekly.chinacdc.cn/en/article/doi/10.46234/ccdcw2020.032) February 2020, describes way categorize cases. key Confirmed cases diagnosed based positive viral nucleic acid test results throat swab samples (some samples tested retrospectively). Suspected cases diagnosed clinically based symptoms exposures. Clinically diagnosed cases suspected cases lung imaging features consistent coronavirus pneumonia. Asymptomatic cases diagnosed based positive viral nucleic acid test results without COVID-19 symptoms (e.g., fever, dry cough).

Ignore ""clinically diagnosed cases"" category - category temporarily existed Hubei province, deal fact Hubei province sufficient PCR testing capacity.

According document, ""confirmed case"" requires positive PCR test symptoms like fever dry cough. epidemiological connection lung imaging required. Exposure history relevant ""suspected cases"" (which makes sense). forget Americans Europe completely legally, like virus doesn’t stick people blue passport.  know one black person represented black people. ever think might bought conspiracy? look simple statistics like covid deathrate simple maths like percentages realise bad. 3% deathrate, total number people worldwide would die covid around 23 million. comparison, 17.9 million people die worldwide EVERY YEAR Heart disease. People maths use statistics perform research objectively placing event ""not bad"" category, you?  Six ICU beds STATE school starts tomorrow? Yikes, guys it. basic infectious disease principles applicable Calgary?  asked me? infuriates relatives believing available beds. bet also Covid deniers similar. OP weren’t busy, He/she take tour ER show them. wear masks social distancing protocols  Well, could always train people. again, would locations administer shot in, idea still completely unusable. kind unrealistic build entire buildings dedicated health services. course could launch pop-up locations — good luck getting permission something like that. TBF Australia external land borders either...  4.2 million died worldwide covid-19. around 1 five-hundred-thousandth percent 0.0005. math, find deadly. Even entire population world contracted covid-19, current death rate 3%, around 23 million would die, thats population Australia. Pretty sure humanity going live vaccine, masks, vaccine masks. bare minimum. I’ve back, pandemic, zero restrictions times. Immigration literally took minute, “welcome back” way. copy pasted title article. even notice 😂  We've done several times, we'll again. 

Main problem winter. vitamin d, everyone indoors, last big outbreak happened last year. It'll get easier maintain 0 spring. Manufacturing sector pretty high. Matches another study saw UK. Pilot program…I see there…  No. states countries real lockdowns - one person leave house food, medical heavily restricted exercise.

Then there's NSW. still go work, weeks ago retail still open (people got infected going IKEA 'lockdown'), still buy takeaway coffee. 

They're practically begging months months lockdown sadly people paying price lives. study conducted using patient records number countries, including U.S., U.K., Germany, Italy, Israel Singapore. team screened de-identified electronic health records TriNetX research database 70 million patients identify two groups 37,377 patients. two patient groups matched factors could influence risk susceptibility severe COVID-19, including limited age, gender, ethnicity, smoking, health problems diabetes, obesity, chronic obstructive pulmonary first study group received flu vaccine two weeks six months prior diagnosed COVID-19. second group also positive COVID-19 diagnosis vaccinated flu. incidence 15 adverse outcomes (sepsis; strokes; deep vein thrombosis DVT; pulmonary embolism; acute respiratory failure; acute respiratory distress syndrome; arthralgia joint pain; renal failure; anorexia; heart attack; pneumonia; emergency department visits; hospital admission; ICU admission; death) within 30, 60, 90 120 days testing positive COVID-19 compared two analysis revealed flu shot significantly likely (up 20% likely) admitted ICU. also significantly likely visit emergency department (up 58% likely), develop sepsis (up 45% likely), stroke (up 58% likely) DVT (up 40% likely). risk death reduced.

There research database. don’t think identifiable recorded. Back? ever stop? Like ever skip one? think did. I’ve seeing ads TV San Diego zoo, wondering this… wonder “save felines/primates” next platform promote vaccinations. Studies shown it’s best 8 weeks doses Pfizer. countries rushed get three weeks contemplating boosters.  Yeah, taught large proportion population become panic-stricken implement fear based measures repercussions echo generations come. mention disinclination towards simple math like percentages statistics.  least point kicking people likely die yet. room change enough invalidate vaccine still infectious (which really isn't) 

lambda evaded vaccinated immune response (""invalidated vaccine) displaced delta mot common variant, displacing delta (""still infectious""). when's going be?

Late 2021 early long hospitals overwhelmed, people part following guidelines, reason constantly lockdown cases pop there.

Without lockdowns, cases quickly become hundreds thousands even millions cases, thousands tens thousands deaths.

That reason Australia taking approach; avoid great many deaths.
People still die even highly vaccinated population, tens thousands. They’ve handled well thus far delta joke, vaccines put test.  New Mexico also, Navajo Nation.

They lost LOT elders beginning pandemic. Something consider culturally devastating way life. elders everything them. 

At beginning, one worst outbreaks country. much so, New Mexico basically quarantined entire Navajo Nation, brought national guard, literally staged supplies order contain spread.

So vaccines became available, it, including buying stock supplement federal government could bring in. brought shots arms, rather setting vaccination sites waiting people show up. went mostly door door. Even sometimes doors miles apart other.

So year, Navajo Nation went one deadly places pandemic, one safest. taking seriously.

Once again, lot learn people first. Even today. I've responded posts explicitly tagged USA flair, giving experiences Japan Germany promptly downvoted lol.

Yeah explicitly US sub that's lots folks treat like anyway.  study full selection bias.

That's exactly point, agree that. actually learn selected group? can't say really better worst.

And care children, ethical let get infected.
We need know, CLEARLY, risk getting diabetes necrological problems scaring lungs, etc. Death worry. see large numbers deaths due people turned away lack access due triaging. Maybe tell going another states hospital socialism convince get vaccinated right thing situation. Well, I'm looking lens teacher start school week half... going bad think that's realistic delta. also know else given vaccine rollout Funny everyone, including comment below, trying paint sources like Reuters Chinese vaccines. Back March numbers good compared places like New York.

I like compare two state similar population totals, although Florida much older population I've gathered.

Cumulative vaccinations states it'll interesting see New York fares Delta stain outbreak finally takes hold north. Can't see flair filter option (using old reddit).

It bad weeks ago, maybe increased traffic due recent rise cases?  Assuming rate vaccine efficiency even pfizer 95%, means even everyone word got vaccinated, 5% world's population would still 'petri-dish' virus. even taking account news says vaccinated may spreading delta variant anyone else. Oh it’s guy who’s stuck Thailand lol  would pandemic? NPR turned Capt. Obvious article. Dude, I'm black, I'm vaccinated, understand mistrust black community medical industry country. Stop trying sew idea vaccine requirements form segregation (you explicitly say it, know thats trying do). black community needs get vaccinated, way get done, it. Mmm…beef weiners. There's needless hypocrisy keeping US doors closed Europeans Europe still open Americans. largely variants; vaccination rates; infection rates. aim live virus endemic problem. 

If US requires vaccinations, perhaps Europe mirror -- end, it'll win-win.  covid-19 guaranteed disappear via everyone masking getting vaccinated, un-vaccinated would probably get vaccinated. science, however, shows virus go away, people rather learn live it, like ancestors lived viruses contributed throughout evolution human beings 'on-average' 10% DNA average modern human constituted picked viruses. conservatives faults filter posts region using flairs though. users American US flairs get upvotes. Can't helped :/ fact yet atrocious. Natural selection witch vaccine available news, plug cellphone charger, charges. get with, vaccine passports coming it’s matter time United States? deep know 5g cause cancer. vaccines work etc. reason put facade denying it. deep deep down. know.  1 50, **bit** better study full selection bias.

You know fuck nothing random sampling, i'm going leave that. isnt much choice. population suseptible health care system could quickly get overwhelmed Delta. Regardless bad good policies places been, almost nations higher natural immunity Australia.  oh i'm fine. 

what really riles though people spouting things like exaggerated false. think that's quite understandable circumstances.  oh yea know came here. strawmanning hard fuck right none positions stated otherwise. making fun fellow citizens dying. Yea I'm dick. I've always always be. enjoy fucked humor. pattern described. Pretty nice humor. Sorry enjoy it. sure puritan sub go though fact selected group ~1,730 mean percentage lower, could even greater. talking like symptomatic big rarity. Anyone running nose symptomatic.

You guys 3rd time try post study right bunch kids getting infected across world due delta variant like saying alright. want good news bad conclusion actually draw study selected kids actually using app? vaccine profits mint 9 new pharma billionaires**

Too bad mint basic supplies like oxygen.  EU higher vaccination % compared US. That’s classic rose tinted view history.

There’s plenty people worked hard pandemic looked protected neighbours friends, collected groceries elderly neighbours shielding etc

There plenty crime people taking advantage situation chaos caused WW2. America public largely world war 2, insignificant amount Americans actually supported Germany 1930s.

Besides back WW2 lot better leadership sure. might encourage unvaccinated people get vaccine find covered insurance catch Covid get hospitalized. enough people getting vaccine slow spread...hence masks again. Every mandate, step, action, etc always goal reducing spread (which turn reduces drains healthcare system). 

Florida still 10 mil unvaccinated people. Thank part, community Florida done enough showing now. Deaths gonna skyrocket southeast next 7-10 days thing Covid-19 2020, around 350,000 Americans died, total population around 330,000,000. means 0.1% Americans died Coronavirus 2020 population essentially vaccines. even care Covid-19? clearly harmless.

Fundamental difference philosophy empathy Nice 😎 tell happen floating all? *assure you* default case continental United States. opened hell mouth, turned merely ugly inequity *existential crisis* many families. year round  Yea… tripled 240… *entire state*.

OT: reminds Sweden's minister finance. said high unemployment, high number people wanting work. politicians actually reason like wrote. though? article talks economics, economic fallout pandemic US mild Australia's. This.

Even staff, equipment ICU ward also limited. DeSantis is, words Alex Jones, ""literal vampire pot-bellied goblin."" There's less deaths average hospitalized COVID case younger, lower CFR.

It's less deadly (neither deadly) really take issue antivaxxers calling us idiots honest. who's saying telling truth time lying times follow train thoughts? measures took curb stomp initial outbreak extreme. Check [this Japanese filmmaker living Nanjing, recorded coming initial lockdown. Compare laughable measures put place Europe &amp; US.. that's difference eradication strategy ""laissez-faire"" strategy*. short pain economic activity months versus destroying economy every 3 months.

* hospitals run ICU beds. won’t. China handled things right pandemic along. Find case. Shut region. Test everyone region. Isolate sick healthy. Covid gone weeks. addition car accident issue, vaccine 100% effective it.  I'm expert see also : least five candidate COVID-19 vaccines use one two human fetal cell lines: HEK-293, kidney cell line widely used research industry comes fetus aborted 1972; PER.C6, proprietary cell line owned Janssen, subsidiary Johnson &amp; Johnson, developed retinal cells 18-week-old fetus aborted 1985. cell lines developed lab molecular biologist Alex van der Eb Leiden University. Two five vaccines entered human trials (see table, below). 1 80 people breakthrough infection severe enough seek covid testing 

That's small subset people breakthrough infections (which dont know since asymptomatic mild breakthrough infections probably arent tested), small set exposed also vaccine (which unknowable/untrackable number realistically), small subset actually vaccine (4.3 million).

All say 100% certainty number 1 80 1 4.3 million.  getting downvoted, think correct. Delta much easier catch, younger people getting it. However, fewer people dying it. Whether that's less deadly (I doubt it) doctors know treat (much likely) anyone's guess. Strength courage sister, alone.

You’re absolutely right everyone risk exposure, things opened full capacity, fact states breaking hospitalization records reported breakthrough cases 99.9% fully vaccinated population still provides real insight - puts perspective lot people may worried - even it’s efficacy, much nuanced shifting.

That said, Lancet study major caveats issues need addressed. read Lancet study directly? doubt people who've intubated exhibit cognitive issues.

I think make Bratwurst-tour Germany. seems, fetch vaccinations tactic. get around FDA/approval issues? Well honestly really need delta booster. fear vaccinated people WAY overblown comes delta. Yes, likely actually get sick real danger dying shots. 

I little worry something breaking vaccination entirely, significant numbers (of deaths, care infections much). But, getting booster current variants make immune response even varied robust. certainly something worth pursuing. see many people sub slam CDC removing mask mandate guidance, but... really get it?

There roughly 2 months updated guidance current surge 1) incredibly low (and declining) case rates 2) vaccines freely available anyone age 12+.

 
Even CDC would continued insisting everyone wear masks, would people listened? Particularly low-vax areas? Count extremely skeptical research

No, don't. That's sort shit leads people watching crazy conspiracy theorists YouTube calling ""research""

So booster may coming soon.   saying there's evidence effectiveness fades seven months. enough data make conclusions 6-month efficacy now. another month, they'll able report 7-month efficacy. course is. anti-vax people even think recognize obvious outcome beyond me. IQ problem country. Got second shot two weeks ago, felt kinda sick next morning like 4 hours back perfectly normal. sore arm couple days. Drama?

Florida hospitals drowning, one thing slow spread.

The Governor denial, Floridians carrying full speed, tourists flow home “freedom.”

The state uncharted territory cases, hospitalizations, think vent usage (based hospitals friends last one, clue state wide that’s stat that’s available people like us).

With one sounding alarm, one going take action slow spread.

DeSantis illegal aliens angle instate mask mandates delay school reopening put backs illegals, it’s point. Could point data shows impact? seen actual studies data, lots articles like basically anecdotes tons confounders. lot elective surgery got cancelled. people scared.

And that's hospitals make money. Quick patient turnover. There’s way they’d ever report number big. Testing volume 100k-150k day. Even Florida wouldn’t get 50% positivity rate.

Now many unreported cases could have? knows. Absolutely. headlines complete misinterpretation data. Yes vaccinated person infected may amount virus start infection unvaccinated person-- key INFECTED. Vaccinated people much less likely infected, overall still much less likely transmit. info concerns vaccinated people infected. 

Also level start infection, drops much quicker vaccinated person unvaccinated person, would transmit less time. Finally, amount viral RNA PCR test even certain mean amount infectious virus present vaccinated person-- may remnants virus destroyed. percentage people need immunity achieve herd immunity varies disease. polio, 80% population must vaccinated. number closer 95% measles, according World Health Organization.

This key point. Since Delta near infectiousness measles, may need 95% immunity stop widespread transmission. 

People choice. Get immunity easy way hard way. One way other. won’t novel handful people soon. 

It’s estimated 90% UK antibodies SARS-cov2. Probably big reason cases dropping. would love see statewide seropositivity studies.

That’s efficacy number, describes results randomized clinical experiment. 

There two groups experiment, got vaccine got placebo. 

Let’s say 20,000 people groups trial. placebo group 1,000 people get severe covid. vaccine group, 18 people get severe covid. 

So without vaccine, would expect 1,000 people get severe covid. number shrank 982. efficacy preventing severe covid vaccine 982/1000 = 0.982 = 98.2% consult doctor. unless she’s immune suppressing drugs, answer likely going “no booster” approved.

The vaccines exactly they’re supposed to; reduce rates infection prevent serious illness become infected. 

I’ll one first line boosters made available. honestly care. Numbers facts, strawman internet arguments.

Learn strawman bud. sides ignore statistics. point. Politics really thing disagree on, really. Everything else, less agree on, thankfully. That's things workplace. We've worked home entire time without issue, reason rush back office. One employees rough go vaccinated. Thankfully back feet know others fucked up. Updated comment. basically right. totally gone number influenza infections past year lower total number deaths normal Plus certain local case prevalence, vaccinated necessarily enough.

Lot sound arguments stay remote, especially employees kids vaccinated less risk parent brings home breakthrough.

At end day, probably lot employees objecting going back soon. saw projection last week showed FL getting 80k per day peaking I've taken general advice consideration seeing kids excelling cyber school I'm going keep long pandemic gone. 

I'm rather Republican district seems prefer push white washing facts. shit show again? vaccinated people getting mildly sick confer portion population Delta immunity, drives R helps everyone. Yes. means get COVID, chances severe symptoms drop 98.2%. Lol, nothing all.

Unfortunately, doctors sort obligation help anyone comes doors. poor uninsured, help you. murderer shot police, help you. can't deny people treatment (assuming beds supplies available). done charge unvaccinated 100% cost covid tests treatments, whether insurance not. Dude, go check door. fully vaccinated. saying people get vaccinated. evidence mRNA vaccines may persistent years may effective variants. saying wait see independent studies show whether need BOOSTER. vaccine manufacturers pushing boosters since delta variant simply seeing dollar signs. 

A booster may needed, going wait see doctors say, board members. think they're upset perfect, they're upset could orders magnitude less harmful people gotten vaccine plenty time started spreading here. suggesting Biden meant ""we could prevented Delta variant getting here"" says preventable? think means effect could fraction is. Unless mycophenolate rituximab, unlikely immune response vaccines different someone without lupus.  variant lucks mutation(s) negates antibodies, positive selection favor escape. 

It advantage actually increases many people person infects.

Let's say people die immediately disease virus causes actually shows symptoms, i.e. infections symptoms start. vaccine prevents symptoms, sterilizing, obviously selective pressure virus bypass protection vaccine offers.

The point is, two effects ""the virus spreads even vaccinated groups"" ""the virus evolves resist vaccine"" counteract understanding. less vaccine prevents spread, less incentive virus resist it. vaccine prevents reduces spread selective pressure resist vaccine. options ""good news"" ""bad news"" part, probably bit both, ""bad news"" both. ;)

We many waves future, biggest problem today we're running places treatment hardest hit. Sure, looking things I've saved past found [this one cardiology uses data Chinese studies initial outbreak (study May 2020). But, like one context talks COVID cardiovascular system related, specifically infects cells using ACE2 receptors.

In layman's terms, ACE2 stands angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. receptors present cardiovascular system, heart, kidneys, intestines, gallbladder, etc. enzyme works catalyzing angiotensin II (a vasoconstrictor) angiotensin (a vasodilator), lowers blood pressure. 

You may heard class medications referred ACE-inhibitors. not, that's OK. work similar ways, inhibiting production angiotensin II, therefore help relax veins arteries.

People heart attacks strokes arteries veins become damaged, inflamed, otherwise functioning properly. COVID targeting ACE2 receptor entry point cells, would make sense major cardiovascular issues could occur, even previously healthy people.

Maybe behavioral differences too, population differences like age. wouldn’t people situation boosters gonna work though? people gonna expected stay home six weeks every six months? sustainable longterm?

Unfortunately body weird things drugs, one late husband’s favorite stories time got anesthesiologist semi-seriously consider suggestion getting drugs use tranq tigers nearby zoo nothing giving intubation working. 

So sedation attempted, mostly didn’t work. Instead, opted amnesia drugs, worked better, 100%. memories 4 1/2 days clear. worst migraine life able ask meds? recommend. hallucinations entertaining, though. Hard say lasting damage pain, severe pneumonia good bit too, each. interesting thing autoimmune condition went temporary remission afterwards…as rheumatologist put it, immune system busy cleanup spend time chewing healthy parts body.

But let tell you, PTSD kicked hard started talking showing “ground glass opacity” xrays Covid patients, mine looked exactly like that. wouldn’t wish severe form Covid worst enemy. know breathing feels like lungs look like that. definitely want better patch time. first one plain brown circle. one better skull hearts least Care Bear it. vaccine headstart. science pretty simple: vaccine causes cells produce spike proteins like coronavirus, immune system mounts immune response deploying antibodies tailoring effective, antibodies fade time (body can't keep antibodies around everything forever). infected COVID, body reacts *but head start already blueprint producing antibodies tailored SARS-CoV2.* Antibodies produced deployed efficacy less changes occurred (changes spike protein), thus immune system must tailor response increase effectiveness.

Still, start scratch- already response could challenge coronavirus could defeat tailored antibodies.

If people breakthrough cases Delta likes produce many times virus, rest assured they'd much worse without head start.

This idiocy- science. get damn near immunity following 2 weeks 2nd shot antibodies hanging around waiting kick corona's ass. wane immunity, body rough blueprint fight later infection occurs.

The real danger strain infectious enough outcompete strains spike protein sufficiently different enough immune system recognize (what considered vaccine evasion). Market. Capitalism.

But *really*. Get jab, wear face-diaper, yell calling later alive so. Vietnam, country I’m in, begs differ. Hmmm, let fill journalist lingo. reason journalists, lawyers even doctors state “may” evidence something purely liability. language structure limits liability else statement could taken factual, without leeway error. looking research itself, research go process peer review. fact findings exist reason enough warrant fear. course, could ignore said, base opinion purely writings journalist read scientific journal outlining findings scientific terms, study patients COVID related mental deterioration, condition patients, could take advise get outcome. thank dedication public health, career faint heart That’s **fifth** US’ total case count today one state. Ugh knew link would local school me. boys death van horrible. Pretty sure vaccinated Sinovac / Sinopharm / Sputnik V treated unvaccinnated thus barred entry. Heck, maybe even vaccinated Astrazeneca Thank honest reply.  sorry we’ve failed colleagues. It’s shameful. Please go easy yourself.  Nah. Normal one year olds even introverted stay home parents get socialization go walks grocery shopping park. Locking one year old literally definitely developmentally damaging. words, actively seek Covid out, contract Covid, quarantine allow immune system handle it, likely considering 99% survival rating killed 4.2 million people worldwide population 7.674 billion, return normal society, embrace even I'm unvaccinated I've got antibodies.

Sound good? someone whose work college centered lot genocide natives American policy, immensely undescribed proud Navajo persevering succeeding America tumbles face Covid yet again. pro lock past. 

Because experience works better vaccines face masks combined lasts 2 weeks. 

But people it. accept vaccines face masks future now.  Cutting reducing alcohol big one. Ok, drawing line something enforce realistically. People lie need help.  meme made gang weed think whole point compel people anything particular way, blame things go wrong.

So mandate masking, mandate vaccines, even use government issue recommendations (most politicians saying persons rather state wide recommendation), ignore hospitals filling up. Personal responsibility! win pedantic game matter many people died! question insurance cover people stuck pocket costs? tried frame incentive get vaccinated, unvaccinated took sign pandemic didn’t need get vaccinated. go get vaccinated like everyone else. Dr. Catherine O’Neal, chief medical officer Lady Lake Regional Medical Center Baton Rouge, said hospital become overwhelmed rationing care able see sickest people first, means **we providing adequate care many people right meet needs sickest first**,” O'Neal said Wednesday. “That safety net care every community depends every type illness starting break down, that’s concerning.”

Oh boy … think every developing nation earth begs differ. Chinese also managed make vaccines country.  This. burn nurses ends long.  time don’t put everybody else danger going public. Knew someone last year California heart attack. travel several hours check several hospitals find place helped. ended hours home hospital everything full. sucks bad again, free vaccine everyone. least USA. sure anyone mentioned yet 30 booked second dose, move forwards (presume aware book via gov.uk site dont need wait gp message you). I'm 30 moved mine end august last friday. don’t steal it. Chinese Fosum Pharma signed deal BioNTech Pfizer full access vaccine. intend set production even intended give everyone booster vaccine. think already imported quite large number Europe. need speak manager.   Midwestern person here. arena used work makeshift ICU March 2020 September 2020. 

Now like covid never hit they're shows &amp; concerts again. choice get vaccinated stay home, don’t get put everyone else danger. Yes, black community victim collective medical malpractice before, isn’t one times. it’s good enough rich white politicians, it’s trick experiment black people. face masks 50% capacity enforced flights ?  That's wild, thing days ago. one family thankfully. put past for-profit vaccine producers (cough, Pfizer) putting PR hit jobs competition increase market share. suspicious moments intense media smearing first Moderna, AstraZeneca, J&amp;J, course Sinovax Sinopharm throughout, turned vastly overblown based minute risks. Meanwhile Pfizer come smelling like roses. I’ve seen sort thing suggested - anti-vaxxers create fake vax cards - don’t know agree that. think strong current stubborn pride spite - dangerous combination - generally runs anti-vaxxers, means even giving mere _appearance_ playing rules would rub many wrong way. love idea conforming much give carry around vax card, albeit fake one.

Instead, think they’d claim taking stupid moral high ground “boycotting” business required vax proof. (Never mind fact it’s boycotting weren’t allowed first place, digress) Yeah, past year probably year coming time don’t want get cancer illness put hospital extended time. It’s even immunocompromised state; lot places plain don’t room. needs done properly:

- penalties falsifying proof
- penalties businesses enforcing
- reliable way test it, QR code would great, think anything provided business owners verify

Delta: Check new super-charged   can't that. would one would know administer shot. think understand problem.

It would wonderful got anywhere near 100% vaccination US, even living largely unvaccinated world long time. 

With Delta rampaging Africa India ""Lamda"" chewing South America, mutations always problem. done try lesson impact. far doubt vaccination that. unvaccinated person much higher risk bad bout covid vaccinated person.

We hope future breakthrough cases mild almost current ones. guarantee that.

According Dr. John Campell (youtube channel) Britain antibodies 98% blood samples taken. came vaccines Alpha-Kent variant. herd immunity, stop Delta sweeping country. death rate much lower Alpha British break though rate much lower Israel. think waiting longer shots Britain.

The US long way go get near British antibody levels. then, going bad outcomes.

Personally, really worried kids point. Unless dad habitually smokes every time he's car age 4-18. I'm still rather bitter. Also, it’s nearly half million people almost every state

I idea many folks. That's wild. people's bedrooms near front door EMTs try save them, like heard radios spring 2020 NYC coup, many doctors worked public hospitals went strike stopped going work.   That's great. think help normalize people hear people community getting vaccine fine. grew Alabama, Mom's side family live there. I'm really relieved older relatives I've talked gotten vaccine including mom aunts. seems like cousins stupid it.  hospitalized ""just flu"" 2009. years started experience diminished lung function. satisfying, deep breath long time.

Ok getting infected half brother taking risk getting sick covid serious illenss? know, another day covid. pop positive tests? Let’s hope not. someone thinks smart get covid vaccine.. Here's concern. 

As soon let government body start making laws mandates name health.. get strong arm whatever political corporate influence get grubby hands them. 

Some obvious examples. Let's say Right gets hands ability. sudden, gay sex banned name slowing spread HIV/Aids. 

Pharmaceutical companies see power get bribe money mix. sudden every single new vaccine pill produce getting pushed mandatory. 

Private prisons see leverage decide ""you know stops spread diseases? Washing hands!"" sudden washing hands punishable offense name stopping spread disease. 

It's easy support mandate forces beliefs someone else. give someone power long til disagree next mandate there's going back. 

I hope people see danger slippery slope avoid making emotional decisions win battle lose war. hard truth we're point need make health decisions self. There's much uncertainty government can't give guidance everyone, except broad strokes. Yes, 3rd booster shot experimental, many medications prescribed ""off-label"". end patients research decide what's best protect health &amp; safety. Everyone's situation different. No, he’d fully vaxxed Pfizer hahahah holy shit that’s amazing, definitely key detail think. Florida nursing school going hospital next week:


**FUCK.** Headline actual article Florida's lack beds lack oxygen. used Binax one CVS followed days later PCR since still getting better. Prednisone decongestant trick. Okay hear let tell Chinese experience vs experience lived country (Mexico).

When there's cases China vast majority population go anywhere want city risk get covid. there's cases going strict lockdown weeks. Yes experience might miserable sure cases drop.
But majority pandemic single restriction put places virtually cases since May 2020 June 2020 coupe small outbreaks there.

Here Mexico one places there's restriction turists. in-person classes since March 2020 vast majority year restaurants either closed 20% capacity. result millions small business closed, 400,000 people died. still able attend person classes able activity sort normality without worrying getting infected. fair, elected covid hit Trump less ""OK"" terms policy then.

Essentially you’re saying that, “until definitively prove negative, I’m willing return normal.” 

I got bad news you: never study concluding “COVID-19 variants way linked cognitive decline neurological problems.” 

Since human body complex, every person different, different genes, medical conditions, immune responses, etc., every infection slightly different, there’s way you’ll ever able conclusively dissociate given condition COVID exposure. Gonna refer ML stuff ""In-silico bias manufacturing"" yeah exactly, people think sicknesses could get much this. remember college lots people got flu, lots people got sick, etc. they’re saying covid contagious smallpox. factor return school largely unvaccinated population happening right now, also factoring mask usage guidelines place said population….we’ll find real quick dangerous delta children. 

of course there’s also lambda variant, supposedly “worse” they're telling us.

Sounds like delightful future. Hospitalization covid almost never occurs quickly infection. No. Zero Covid never possibility. wanted flatten curve vaccine out, remember? case discuss doctors personally liable? Probably conspiracy side TikTok. None official data shows case. What's strange it?  God feel you. I’ve taken time I’m still pushing burnout. Take care mental health first. lawyer discuss legality this? seems like blatant violation HIPAA singling one communicable disease neglecting others could possibly spread, too.

FTFY Kids OK school. Lots parents think hinder development case. I'm teacher left classroom started returning covid feel comfortable school district safety measures, I've remote lessons tutoring online many kids great this. OK, sure it. Pretty much. rather arrogant Man believe “control"" nature. Testing irrelevant, hospitalizations metric consequence. taking hospital resources means less resources non-covid health issues like heart attacks strokes. rare long term negative side effects almost vaccines.

That true, known occur within two months administration. recall last summer (hearing via Week Virology Pipeline) scientists quite keen waiting hear cases GBS possibility ADE (antibody-dependent enhancement) phase 3 clinical trials going first handful vaccines. See good writeup last June.

However, bunch current fearmongering ""long term effects"" people claiming vaccines cause get cancer five years drop dead fifteen years now. understand (and may care understand) MRNA hang around body long enough mechanism that.

(Side note: know what's important myocarditis? treat effectively over-the-counter painkillers couple days' rest.) society going bear burden keeping children locked extreme outlier COVID cases ever will.

This sub gone crazy. It’s incredible much goalposts changed ever since vaccines dramatically cut death count. Kids still minimal risk COVID, 12 (who technically ‘at risk’ underage) get vaccinated.

This sub going rest case count 0, never. .....Poop masks? What's going there? Contrary covid... muffled voices fixed better mask design silicon spacers. curious long-term changes express interpret facial expressions, expressions develop among masked societies unmasked trouble interpreting properly.

Lol last year half?Biggest drop US life expectancy since WW2 that’s shutdowns virus suppression symptoms efforts. mention long term effects 20-30% Covid survivors. vaccine works variants, nearly eradicating pre-Delta variants.

I'm saying go path.. need draw specific lines what's considered threshold allow it. instance many people per million would need die considered lethal enough. contagious need be? someone feels need look specific covid numbers copy/paste threshold. obvious wanting health safety.

Yes, kids get sick adults. hope doubt it. vaccination rates around 40ish%, schools going take financial hit turning away half tuition payers.  Yes, meant new stimulus program, perhaps proper appropriate qualification updates included. course. not, would never pass, everyone gets theirs. lot people saying ""what long term effects?"" conflating two different meanings ""long term"" -- things affect long period time versus things long lead time causality. former exist small probabilities vaccines we've got, latter don't.

People understand might reasonably go wrong vaccines, assume anything possible: they'll make magnetic, they'll make drop dead 15 years, they'll give cancer, they'll make grow third arm. good writeup last summer (while clinical trials first vaccines still going on) medicinal chemist Derek Lowe might reasonably expect go wrong. interview last winter Paul Offit (who worked vaccine rotavirus) good discussion vaccine developement safety concerns; 22:20-26:00 video talk six-week rule thumb long-term effects appearing.

I'm curious they're waiting full approval; multiple judges ruled employers require employees get vaccinated already. pretty obvious downvoted. 11 states already said going pass mandated force vaccines citing constitution. federally mandated hopefully isnt.

Domestic travel discouraged travelers go enforced quarantine. course close international border, lot foreign tourists, workers etc China blanket order saying can't go home would resulted massive foreign affairs shitstorm. receiving countries ensure travelers coming properly tested quarantined,, unfortunately countries like US anything regard. Smoking bad example, though, know secondhand smoke. Get vaccinated. It’s free, it’s easy, won’t keep argument people. Worst case scenario, it’s redundant, best case scenario you’re doubly protected.

Well don’t admit patients make die parking lot hospitals full technically it’s slowed Maybe DeSantis 3 bits virus trench coat. Delta variant US May? Yeah, society. Republican leaders exact. Please call like is.  like tom hank's wife  still hard get vaccines outside US, they'd making US citizens stranded (who presumably would go US get vaccinated) unless develop plan vaccinate expats. supposed imply something? war changed. change next year. gotta keep adapt. would make much sense.  xrays unvaccinated vaccinated person lungs looked much better. Needs study, anecdotal stuff pointing vaccine helping issues.

Another one says 50% reduction vaccinated people syntopms 28 days later. issue, that’s exactly anecdotal means. Rall actually addresses statement article, says believed chance booster might deprive someone vaccine, wouldn’t gotten it. made mind reading a report that states likely toss 26.2 million unused doses due low demand. decision effect policy, saved vaccine dose garbage. Massachusetts here. hospitals normal levels people able go public places without masks, based honor system vaccination. Nobody know said infections family/close friends.

It may crazy coincidence, us believe science got vaccinated soon could.  Oh God, thank belly laugh. virus nightmare keeps getting worse.

Jokes you, beds already gone. get wreck, caught fire, part mass shooting, anything else. Cause fucked, nice proper fucked. announce hopefully people get vaccinated

That almost certainly plan, yes. creating straw man argument beating instead honestly discussing this. 

If 4 experts, 3 says something says evidence either way yet, mean conclusion go 3 substitute uninformed opinion. that's here. 

You found one expert says data, trying use negate studies actually done experts. trying pretend said go misstated, bastardized version one expert said. 

You honest. god's sakes, like this? clear interest real conversation. Blocking moving on. Goodbye, hope become better person. part deaths skyrocket certain point hospital system overloaded.

Real easy way keep bennies. wise it.  may follow science aint talking sociologists.

It's tunnel vision. They're focused covid, nothing else matters, even public health emergencies like opioid epidemic. (BTW, still going on. Covid cancel drug addiction overdoses) “we ever cared hospitalization data here” BS

The people love complaining moving goalposts, reality, projecting. assume people move goalposts do. Hospital employees call ER - ED - emergency dept. nurse - work cardiology - cardiology room cardiology department. bad CDC obtain type data. I'd love know US. GOOD. Yep, going theme year.   LOL cuz hoax-19 anti mask crew said they’d wear masks protect us. wasn’t thought. RN TN here. Seeing sharp uptick area. pray get bad again. That’s sad see, getting message unique way. Sadly, people still won’t listen. point would make sense OP mentioned FL talking well UK did, OP made mention Florida. OP said basically Boris proved naysayers wrong, nothing Florida. u/donobinladin retorts, ""How's working Florida Missouri?"" 

We know well UK Florida dealt COVID differently, criticism makes sense, especially one else talking Florida, chose basically argue strawman.  found Halloween decoration theme year.

Risk life economy absolutely horrible, see healthcare workers walking away jobs droves. I'm Dallas btw everybody family 4 immunocompromised, whether old age cancer. reverted back staying day except essentials.

You seem like kind caring soul, please safe.  I’m confused can’t spread vaccinated [Here pic skeleton](http://imgur.com/a/QvRBhPf) watch video order see it. blame them. people made political football playing peoples lives. window May June. squandered window. Infinite. Literally nothing. numbers worse March broward still trying fight DeSantis allowing us mask mandate. point actively fighting governor base ignore it. answer. I'm doctor care kinds people simple things save lives health: 

But overwhelmed system one year brought healthcare folks breaking point. smoking, eat salad while, get 30 minutes exercise 3 times per week, etc.

Those hard things need constant commitment. Getting two shots vaccine super easy one time effort. Yep. care happens them, ignorant demented people, care harm cause others.  Problem long humans involved, things always get fudged somewhere. part human nature. I’m sorry loss. I’m sad angry you. vaccine help car accidents emergencies hospital full COVID patients. Freak all.  Good! Lionel, show door!!!! Indeed. That's logic behind restricting stopping travel countries. makes sense. what's happening.

Americans able come UK/EU, mingle, go back US. American citizens living UK/EU go US, mingle, come back.

UK EU citizens cannot travel US.

If stopping Covid passport hold rather coming from. drives risk. New Zealand also island, orders magnitude easier one hard lockdown, open country locals keeping borders closed.

That last line makes sound like Delta 50%+ death rate. goes tiny, 6 kid daycare that’s it. didn’t work I’d pull that’s option.  heard phrase ""There atheists foxholes""?

There science deniers back ambulances, either.

Perhaps quite none either case: fears realized, beliefs assumptions hold up. one best threads medical staff sharing feelings wave pandemic. Everything open vaccinated. masks needed minimal cases recently idea seems 0 covid bonkers! Actually article originated Reuters. Reuters unusual bias Chinese vaccines given Chairman sits executive board Pfizer. fair higher proportion population also vaccinated (compared Florida) reduced R rate significantly. 

But yeah right UK. CDC fumbled, fucked, exploded ball whole pandemic. ""You need mask"" almost every single communication they've given since. know kind hire need make, need make them, needed yesterday. struggling badly convey kind shit population. 

It's gotta FEMA's Katrina response disastrous organizational response human history - least communications side. meeting new people connect groups covid spread. meet number good friends, maybe get ends. change group, infect new group, too. 4.4% positives, can't people bother read study. 4.4% specific frame positive tested children simptomatic onset specific timeframe, used data sharing app properly.

It's 1% positives course misses lot covid kids tested, real number probably much, much lower. Oh nowhere close infectious disease known. There's good figure comparing diseases presented excess deaths.

This paper Lancet estimates number covid deaths usa closer 766k, prior end May 2021, based excess death counts: top excess deaths lack cancer care heart attacks problems emergency rooms full. 

With way Delta raging, really surprised hit 700,000+ officially, 1 million+ estimated end year. That's less 25% increase 25% time date seems reasonable estimate. would mean ICU 68 beds aren’t available? many people could even pay medical bills, already stupid enough take vaccine much brighter making money. May god people Mississippi.   Family … aka. people kill first. Reddit moment Yes. hell people keep talking bee's knees. What's special knees? made titanium one know it? aphrodisiac?  Yeah, think expecting honor system work said vaccinated people go maskless basically cherry top idiot sundae. 

I think realized CDC INCREDIBLY touch social reality pandemic ground floor. Actual serious name. ""B.1.617.2.1 AY.1"" mentioned article. sounds like give Greek letters (like storms) note worthy. Alpha, Betta Gamma, Delta...  US bee's knees, Delta spreading strong countries proper data make good picture.

And ramp up, deaths near previous peaks 90% places.  guy said breakthrough cases happen people lying. said report breakthrough cases discarded since people farming karma. china .. uncle kids drive Las Vegas later today. They’re vaccinated, breakthrough cases spooked.   data analysts i've spoken hate emotional intimidation that's what's used information day. card we've dealt with. would told three years ago needed experimental pharmaceutical product able go life would laughed face, seeing effects, works, even 100% effective, reduces risk. talk ""oh side effects"" course going side effects people!, people even side effects counter medications...

We adapt world evolves, vaccine climate change that's sure... No. not. even little bit. find best data ages vaccination statuses hospitalized?

It would really interesting see count hospitalized age vaccination status. fuckups. truly special.

this scales well across vectors.   course. saw mother pass covid last thursday. prior that, last words 'call get hospital.' never heard again. last time saw bi pap stats terrible. invasive ventilator, work. give go ahead tell nurse take it, gone two minutes later, scribbled 2:07 door. also started states beginning pandemic well. wasn't. month ago delta considered slowly creeping big concern yet. get wrong, hope ramp up, signs show might happen. wait offered now, [book online NHS open anyone aged 18+. Instant lockdown works provides best outcome. NZ totally Covid free zero restrictions since February. let virus social distancing masking becomes necessary long term. 

With Delta living virus unless very, high vaccination rates. Dear God please let vaccinate kids idiot governor gets sick. currently Covid, doctor treating via telephone I'm home. got vaccine March/April (I compromised immune system) us glad got progressed point needing hospital bed. Fever gone 3 days, muscle aches 6. I'm waiting slight cough bit phlegm clear up. 

This would absolutely landed hospital, along 30 percent chance fatality gotten vaccine. can't even imagine long would spent hospital.

Anyone doubt, trust get vaccine. save much misery. That's point I'm making, said.

You implied people avoiding talk Covid mutating less severe virus sell papers, that's ever something happen soon enough ever option wait for. Honestly outrage want mask mandates want locks downs. asking testing isolation base (most would like masks I'm schools shit seriously point want SOMETHING)

Go read r/Calgary headline. Half comments ""yes! someone said can't hide forever!"" retorts people saying want want tracking testing isolate positive cases. idea considered ""extraordinary measures"" damn pandemic. That's extraordinary that's bare minimum. Probably. Unfortunately them, every country require proof vaccination moving forward. Keeping border locked viable solution anymore; opening everyone cause new lockdowns. Therefore, best solution allow fully vaccinated travelers. No, Gamma Lambda dominate. No, others took precautions others prioritized. Anybody decides herd desperately needs immunity made decision themselves. Decisions consequences, simple that.  politicization vaccination done huge damage. creates suspicion offered vaccines (why mRNAs?) discourage uptake (if take Pfizer/Moderna cannot travel!). World really come unified approach. Novavax Sputnik production problems bad news EVERYONE. 

Also, like rosy Pfizer vaccine Israeli studies showing Delta. Sinovac met Gamma Lambda. this. Although think permanent thing. Perhaps cases truly start go good drop it. propose do, shove ass? when's going be? fine balance. long hospitals overwhelmed, people part following guidelines, reason constantly lockdown cases pop there. Vaccines help lessen severity virus, still catch it. Aiming zero cases impossible, unless plan shut borders world forever. mention many health care orgs severely mismanaged pandemic showed exactly precautions willing take workers (un)important workers’ safety concerns become them. could guessed, profit driven system abuses kindness (in case residents) lack job flexibility workers eventually exposed

I’m glad health care workers breaking simulation growing disillusioned en masse propaganda. society shown they’ll spit sacrifices HCWs make, disconnect clinical administrative sides medicine never wider Maybe remaining Christian Scientists get exception, that's probably speed run. shit Thailand. Useless Junta government gave vaccine production company owned ""someone"" pretty much bought garbage sinovac one top conglomerates bought stock company. healthcare workers still working though. Also, made new mandate people spreading ""scary news"" get internet turned off.  fuck think would happen? Respectfully, sounds like you’re date Delta. problem Delta dumps insane viral load anyone, even kids likely get sick before. Kids unvaccinated, chance increases. bother.

SAN DIEGO — vaccinate tiger? cheetah? baboon?

Carefully — carefully. lots training treats.

As COVID-19 cases surge throughout region, San Diego Zoo Safari Park hustling immunize array animals could give Noah’s Ark run money, tigers Vervet monkeys hyenas critters staff think could vulnerable virus. end week, they’ll doled first doses roughly 250 animals, many endangered species.

“We’re similar situation us humans months ago, vaccines \[first\] available,” said Dr. Hendrik Nollens, leads veterinary teams zoo Safari Park. “Now it’s race time. Who’s going get first: vaccine virus?”

Recent events given efforts fresh urgency. Monday, Safari Park learned five six Sumatran tigers COVID-19 testing stool samples animals. Keepers first suspected something amiss Rakan — 300-pound, 4-year-old male — seemed sluggish wasn’t scarfing meals usual gusto. Staff noticed coughing slightly.

Three tigers also showing symptoms, mainly coughing low energy, closely monitored. news comes days zoo learned snow leopards, Ramil Naphisa, COVID-19. leopards mild coughs nearly made full recovery, according Lisa Peterson, executive director Safari Park.

While organization says it’s sure snow leopards tigers got infected, it’s probable caught virus employee infected didn’t symptoms. That’s happened back mid-January, Safari Park’s gorilla troop contracted virus.

Both facilities hoping two-pronged strategy stricter masking vaccination limit future transmission. Following snow leopard infections, staff must wear masks working animals veterinary staff believe could susceptible COVID-19 — regardless whether employees fully vaccinated, whether they’re indoors outdoors. Previously, staff weren’t fully vaccinated masks.

The organization also continued vaccinate animals parks. efforts began late January, zoo inoculated orangutans bonobos, marking first time apes immunized virus.

And trying poke wild animal needle might sound like recipe disaster, it’s something zoo Safari Park staff routinely combination coaxing conditioning.

For Amara cheetah, means bribing cat yummy morsel meat “bloodsicle,” frozen chunk blood lick sidles edge cage quick poke. Johnny coati, distant relative racoon, means enticing spoonful honey inside plastic container, prompting stick head inside vet administers vaccine.

“I would say easily greater 75% animals I’ve vaccinated, don’t even react,” said Dr. Daniel Fredholm, veterinarian who’s given coronavirus vaccines 40 animals Safari Park.

Staff generally avoid anesthetizing animals whenever possible, Peterson said, want avoid side effects anesthesia would rather wildlife willingly participate healthcare. animal gets walks away veterinarian deliver shot, usually try later.

In cases, keepers use call medical squeeze, narrow metal crate animals learned walk vet delivers shot hole side. Oddly enough, hard part getting walk end, according Annette Russel, member Safari Park’s wildlife care team.

“They don’t want leave,” said. “They get reinforced stay. ‘No, I’m A-plus student. Where’s good stuff?’ takes work exit go in.”

The organization getting vaccine doses Zoetis, animal health company part Pfizer. company’s vaccine, cleared use animals, sparks immunity coronavirus delivering piece surface protein virus uses grab onto infect cells.

The vaccine requires two doses, spaced two weeks apart, full immunity. staff finish administering first doses week, they’ll begin giving second doses. Three tigers recently tested positive coronavirus received first vaccine dose days tested positive gotten second shot.

Researchers still learning animals respond coronavirus vaccines virus itself. Scientists occasion spotted infections lions, domestic cats, dogs minks, among mammals, according Centers Disease Control Prevention. cases mild.

Zoo staff plan take blood samples vaccinated animals measure immune responses. keepers working Scripps Research use DNA sequencing determine viral variants infecting wildlife. They’ve already learned two snow leopards weren’t infected fast-spreading Delta variant, estimated account 80% new human coronavirus cases U.S.

“We don’t data institutions we’ve forefront beginning,” Nollens said. “Which great, there’s downside: There’s lessons learned go to.” little sympathy anti Vax people dying, hope appendix decide explode (or emergency) cause hospitals full rona. feel bad people die reason covid idiots filling beds Good, be.

Vaccines make covid-19 endemic, endless masking. giant skeletons sale Home Depot folks. pretty good $200 bucks think paid it. 91% effective severe illness according Israeli data. 

But, 39% efficacy means something like

""41% people test positive, vaccinated""?

The total nun people represented 41% hopefully much lower than, say, July 2020. Doess getting COVID vaccinated function booster? I’m EM, feel wholeheartedly.

Great idea track breakthrough cases. mean probably aren’t. places losing say 20% staff would horrendous patient safety. They’re already likely 20% short staffed

Medical staff nations simply get paid enough deal shit. It’s pretty horrible bystander, can’t even imagine stressful, tiring, heartbreaking scary it’s midst all. 

You guys bearing way much burden right clearly sustainable, cannot keep asking people who’ve already dealing long. least otherwise unhelpful citizens wear fucking mask get fucking jab. *be fucking nice!* point literally hosts run effectively Interesting think Florida somehow better, people-wise.

Yes, taxes prices higher here, lots things make it. bad, lots people would leaving. always things improve on, see CA FL, blinders cloud perception. JNJ going one shot marketing decision. (To differentiate options). nothing makes inheritently better single shot mRNA vaccines. JNJ elected go one shot that's tested approved. Bless you’re doing. read article, study patients 60. necessarily mean 60 nothing worry young people included study. ""As soon let government body start making laws mandates name health.""

Drunk driving restrictions laws let government body make name health (specifically, serious injury death others). that's already allowed. 
 
 
As specific instance, discussion question LA city council, power enact laws already, considering another law. relying ""some emergency ruling whim"", quite literally legislative body discussing legislation. 
 
What believe ""process typical law making"" laws apply specifically city Los Angeles?  Sometimes.. course felt way around waiting vaccines US widely available everywhere.

I'm also 30, know people age US getting shots parents could. South Sandwich Island sounds lovely. Well then, yeah, sounds pretty inefficient. \**shocked pikachu face* Ah, however less chance infection? wear mask hate parents. don’t think high schools specifically blanket mandate masks punish us vaccinated, heck I’ll senior don’t want masks year third year covid high school. like, dunno, something could go face keep passing virus family friends. Or, here’s idea, shot something people could take would greatly reduce severity risk transmission.

Someone work something like that. want use entire population vaccinated this, looking COVID deaths entire population unvaccinated last months ALSO shows dangerous.

I certainly dont agree locked time btw, people offer alternative. say 'lockdowns kill' present data supports that, cancel everybody doesnt think way do. sadly, goes people’s heads unvaccinated lick understanding serious is. much misinformation gotten around point many people believe beyond me. somehow pushed voice it’s “false information” it’s still true. truly wished everyone could gone hospitals covid was/is peak times. Tell it’s fake sort hoax vaccines optional it’s trustworthy bill gates magnetic bs causes sort disruption dna causes future problems like baby causes problems. blast make America great got brain dead numb nuts run society live it. many things going on, many problems yet add fuel fire already messed society. Even get 80% population vaccinated, likely still thousands even tens thousand cases given vaccine efficiency, delta transmission levels factors. Can't see handled Oz unless total change approach made. addition others said, Tyson also recently made mandate workers.    So, *want* everyone catch Covid? Orange co ER nurse here, surge Nov -feb. docs started reducing thresh hold o2 requirements. content keeps sats ~85% conserve o2. small community hospital would get liquid o2 refills maybe every 2-3wks, worst refills ever 2-3days. would normally see 1-2 deaths/week, height seeing 3-4 deaths/day. 
 
It sucks hopefully last months y’all us. Sadly, Covid numbers getting higher positive beds back 1/4-1/3 total population (highest 2/3 total surge). live San Antonio. I’m scared go work. many shitheads Doc another doc: fine patients: would worse without aid. Thank caring patients mean, Reuters mention ...  Every hospital reserves code beds, never know someone code require ICU level bed. Sometimes we’d bad luck get lot sick people there’s ICU beds left code beds bump whoever least sick ICU you’re sort trying figure who’s likely die don’t put ICU.

Not fun bunch ICU level sick patients non ICU floors end running entire night trying compensate lack ICU staffing. love Florida, there’s literally sub devoted Florida Man joke, always new content. Florida league own. Infected unvaccinated higher viral load infected vaccinated too, stronger symptoms, meaning infectious. Actually, it’s FIRST harm. you’ve exhausted attempt, harm away.  point would shocked anyone US (other kids yet approved) vaccination asking within day. mean, no. sources say false? Even prove true, ones refuse covid vaccine ones refuse get flu vaccine ""they want get sick it"" whatever baloney reason have. Oh well, say anymore Still think unvaccinated sign DNR (do resuscitate) become part history. Don’t tax system complain about. Selfish pricks. Meanwhile fact won’t issue state emergency means hospitals running oxygen. actually national stockpile that’s boarded wealthy, can’t get fast enough.

Obviously take appendicitis patient utilitarian bang buck higher, spend much less time ICU. Vaccinated status irrelevant, e.g. think still make decision appendicitis patient unvaccinated covid patient vaccinated. 

In end utilitarian decisions, that's I'm saying. vaccine mitigates deaths covid, unvaccinated people may need ventilators more. 6 beds left? awful. Um, what’s lunch? real. Many nurses excluded stimulus pay - know was. Made barely much children time. needs incentive time around. People burnt it. Hopefully some. Frankly haven’t come around yet I’m sure could possibly change mind.  sake masks vaccinations :( think corelation ?

Housing crisis related Covid ?

Wage stagnation related Covid ?

These two real issues - getting vaccinated going help solve them.

Covid crisis also real issue - getting vaccinated going solve it.

Climate crisis ? solved vaccins either, top list. hope right. Hospitals seem worse spot right compared first wave. Yes, vaccinated people spreading vaccinated people isn’t likely fill hospitals cause mutations faster keep with.  Let god sort willing unvaccinated Without randomized trial think reliable.

Those elect flu vaccinations representative general population. likely confounding factors involved. Well isnt flu?  Fucking G R M. There’s whole lot suffering catch people :( False equivalency track actual data, ""might"", ""it could"" ""perhaps"".

Maybe. read like anti-vaxxer BS, lot sleep. guarantee goofballs going presidential candidate spot soon. I’m Austin (next door), got alert, never said word many vaccinated not, wouldn’t. simply would part emergency alert. lockdown still mean thing used to?

It’s already one infectious diseases history.  realise 4.3 billion vaccines given globally? whole Europe nearly surpassed US vaccinated levels heard likely result hospitalization here: many many hospitals full moment, logical increase hospitalizations bring deaths it. realistic solution: mandatory testing enforced 14 day quarantine unless fully vaxxed

WAIT. -train- people? saying people actually learn things? getting vaccinated reduces risk killing classmates. made chuckle. He's wrong. data unsuitable draw conclusions headline, well comments.

A counterexample particular concern: vaccine prevents infection 100% certainty, works 99.9% people nothing remaining 0.1% (which would amazing vaccine), breakthrough cases also CFR original disease. God, you, sir/ma'am, genius! Take free waffle! Take Nobel Prize! never will. I'll join revolution accept dystopian distortion reality, looks like revolution televised.

And stop mutating already dumb virus! notice said daily vaccinations, developing country could match budget developed nations procuring vaccines last year, got bulk supply Q2 year.

Unlike USA, large majority Malaysian population Klang valley, 98% 1st dose, current rate daily vaccination, reach herd immunity US.   That’s people don’t understand. reeeeeallly close last spring that. Basically sever covid becoming 1:1 mortality saturation.

THATS important question here!  Festival attendees rarely 80’s though. Covid kills old fat rates, mortality younger 80 obese miniscule comparison. 

Lolapalooza wont almost 2 100 dead, even noone vaccinated. say like Israel? said 80% vaccination. Israel's nowhere near 80% population fully vaccinated. Lol Im Malaysia currently top 3 daily vaccinations, entire country still beds low oxygen

Only 46% people Malaysia first jab, 24% fully vaccinated. USA 57.9% 49.7%. I've COVID bad. proceeded get Pfizer vaccine body reacted much stronger COVID. 24 hours vaccine got breast pain. taken ER luckily mild pericarditis (they see anything ultrasound heart).

Jokes them, already written note giving two weeks notice. comes it, except rare occasions go public short periods time, would rather stay fuck home.

I'm infuriated leadership state federal levels days. told new leadership would help correct madness previous years, things arguably become muddied disorganized. mess right many reasons, personal accountability mixed messages leadership seem hell bent ignoring common sense. sick this. humans involved places actual lockdowns saw results; Sydney's comparatively non-committal dragging out. Announce everyone unvaccinated non-covid patient needs ICU bed, getting yanked oxygen supply. Good luck. hope unmasked, unvaccinated friends dont get sick die. They've significant stretches COVID cases. Especially dealing cases community, Victoria, example, 6 million people never 100 active COVID cases point mid-October mid-July. There's months within active cases someone got COVID locally (so much time, active cases people quarantine trying enter country)

Really, biggest failing lack actual quarantine facilities, Australia able get zero local cases large stretches time (or situations 1 2 people get caught quick enough spreads) population worry getting transmitting COVID big periods time. Duh? Im pretty sure variants around corner. hotbeds vaccinated people getting infected unvaccinated. delta variant introduced vaccine small amounts, becomes immune it, mutates transmutes unvaccinated person, mutates again, we’re screwed. delta variant variant.  500K attendees last year, I'm sure many died Covid (1.7% Mortality Rate)

Narcissists gonna narcissist. Unvaccinated believe meant say. deleted know said.... response still awesome Here's thing. longer care people's perceptions me.

COVID riders unite! Healthcare right everyone. free shot publicly available everyone would prevent risk serious illness hospitalization. Oh wait.  overkill mask PC get covid virus? referring covid, nice try. Sounds fair. Inside daycare fine, inside home fine, outside floor lava. Go new see lots articles over. get fewer votes less discussion make front page they're there.  imbecile consumed fighting people don’t align beliefs swear loyalty him, willing ignore job protect people state. (Sound familiar?) Yes, China population billion people less cases Finland slightly 5 million people. Considering virus spreads there's simply level covid response could generate low case figures highly densely populated country like China. don’t disagree you, response person saying Australia enough vaccines everyone 6 months ago. described applicable Australia? okay use ambulance bed bed hospital bc nurse walked out? problem going deeper that, getting greater supplies earlier didn't. EU fully vaccinated half population, another 10% partially vaccinated right now. Contrast Australia, currently fully vaccinated sixth population, another sixth partially vaccinated. 34% total, bit half fraction EU fully partially vaccinated.

So yeah, extent people 'choice' still great. mention UK EU done second doses.... lot people Australia still issues finding access it. Lot stories people 40 turned away getting vaccine told able get first dose vaccine months:  shit show. I'm basing understanding link international travel: box near top titled 'have fully vaccinated' * footnote refers text lower stating:

They'll die.   Well no…they said worked 6 months March 6 month mark. It’s unclear timeframe exactly moderna referring to, Pfizer’s recent announcement covered approximately September March, ostensibly one moderna same.

COVID TAUGHT EVERYTHING Nope understand, think were, wanted add perspective case anyone struggling new found cognitive issues. Eu donated lot vaccines already? strategies working together though would quickly end pandemic.  That’s wild statistic Start moving last unvaccinated COVID patient came hallway someone comes needs bed. OP didn’t say breakthrough infection isn’t common, said breakthrough cases resulting hospitalizations uncommon. 

Is happening? Yes.. it’s something like .001% end hospitalized. Australia never get either unless make mandatory. country anywhere close 80%? There's many people never willingly take shot viable goal hold rest country hostage proves highly vaccinated population shield worst outcomes doesn’t really apply us here. states population comparable UK well 50% vaccinated, unfortunately. states provide resources take care residents?

Right congratulate worst clearance rates violent crime country. Host indoor, maskless, political rallies? Mississippian here.

It’s fucking weird right now. 2 months ago, 50% population wearing masks (too low, know, wait). NOW, 30% people wearing masks.

What fuck?? Everyone around KNOWS it’s getting worse again, they’re ignoring it. It’s even political social issue. It’s like people blissfully pretending live fantasy land COVID far away thing.

Even companies “masks required” signs front door aren’t anything it. Kroger yesterday almost nobody masked employees managers weren’t thing it. I'd like go get Moderna booster then. “Artificially limiting eligible go hospitals” might Japan’s unofficial motto dealing COVID. I’m assuming you’re familiar Japan pandemic...remember “wait contact local healthcare center fever higher 37.5c four consecutive days” policy? What’s happening right like variation that.

I agree point every infected person able see doctor, person remotely, determine risk level. said, current wave seems patients younger sometimes sicker faster, even without known risk factors. I’m medical expert, seems difficult doctors predict get severe symptoms not. [a Japanese today eight men thirties fifties died home fighting COVID home. comparison, eight people died gifting COVID home Tokyo December 2020-July 2021.

Then again, Japan isn’t testing people extensively countries, must many people kept dark whether infected, even experiencing cold-like symptoms finding people around tested positive. aren’t tested, obviously can’t get evaluated doctors safe home quarantine... source article: pleased COVID-19 vaccine showing durable efficacy 93% six months, recognize Delta variant significant new threat must remain vigilant.""**

people breakthrough infections died doesn’t mean died Covid. get people vaccinated. Lot’s people may admitted hospital breakthrough infections, primary diagnosis cause death Covid. Let's expand it. question bed, occupied unvaccinated covid patients patient came needs ICU unrelated covid chance survival quite high get ICU.

Now do?

How look person straight face say gave freedom idiots get vaccinated treat everyone same, fill ICU beds due stupid pay price them.  Elderly immune-compromised people often mount good immune response vaccine. third dose helpful according one study saw. Part push third dose probably easier give everyone certain age certain conditions third dose rather cost tests necessary check immune levels.

However, right offer third doses widely countries first doses.  doesn’t sound like families people care ones requesting coroner. Still wrong though. Bleh, sentiment worse anti vaxxers. Acting superior dismissing other's humanity making poor decisions helping anyone. term “high dosage” CBD mentioned study. 

Can anyone help find/understand meant that? Specifically, clinical tests CBD administered, dosage? (ie. mg/day) things definitely worst (and trending wrong direction) Southeast Asia, noted exception Malaysia, every country still lower case counts per million US parts Western Europe, probably illustrative much lower standard West reopening. Nonetheless, lack vaccine supply definitely problem, needs rethink NPIs employed (which seem insufficient Delta's higher R0) meantime. can’t sure, would huge Moderna vaccine protecting Pfizer vaccine. think would crystal clear point case. Yes, correct. understand civil rights cannot force vaccinations (polio would like word), certainly withhold care people won’t take tiniest steps prevent getting seriously ill. I've maintained FB account keep touch people easily - brief time there, think FB huge part problem. echo chamber willful, stubborn ignorance... could see whole communities buying other's shit posts perpetuating misinformation. get saved ""praise Jesus"" saving back square stupid them. Fair point seem act far decisively many places, bounced back faster pretty much anywhere else.  JFC. sorry. think everyone get conspiracy nut anti vaxxer. possible person bad history seeing doctors, realize completely free, thought would eventually see bill, thought would long process, etc. lot vaccine messaging letting people know things thats months messaging vs years bad relationships doctors many lower income Americans have.  America since day one pandemic. Apologist chime list nots, always boil profitable means make happen. Honestly comes going Grand Island, let die Ascension South Jacksonville 153% capacity.

Broward Health Miami 117%.

Its crazy right now. preventable. Damn it! Lies! also want point HEK-293 cell line immortalized cell line, meaning technically grow forever genetic growth profile. additional abortions (besides two) purposes generating similar cell lines occurred decades. Forgive ignorance even mean?

In mind, capacity limit can't go 100%. 161% capacity, would say underestimated capacity before. course make sense.

My friend died anti-vax folks. filled first hospital taken to, divert another hospital two half hours away, could get emergency surgery needed live hospital overwhelmed Covid patients.

They quite literally killing people selfishness. situation though deaths due covid anymore, deaths emergencies can't handled.

Unfortunately fear states like Florida never report accurately get complete picture. like politicans news outlets called racist ending flights china january? encouraged people go local chinese new year celebrations? actual china already locked shut rest world?

Trump performed exactly many world leaders did, like said, didnt good job. covid fault, CURRENT state things goes show getting office didnt magically fix anything, looks unlikely office started would prevented things getting us US right now. You? I'm neither American government United States. 

Some states worse others. could European countries insist U.S. travelers provide vaccination certificate negative COVID test prior entry. totally spend week dark cold extreme weather horrible preparation all.

/s app gets confirmation state database. Kinda like New York set Aw, shit. even think that. many states hit hard coastal. me. Implicit liberty choose differently. take care mine. avoid people believe things different, toxic, lack company reward itself. take measure due care get mild inconvenience.

And self destructive leave abandoned assets that's something hope waste not, want not.

Yeah, it’s really hard people say conservatives idiots (and liberal come)—but people bad eating news tend, think, biased positively. seems conservatives think world scary dangerous place end making conspiracy theories etc, liberals like live happy denial instead deal reality, hold onto one Scientists opinion instance it’s positive keeps world view everything okay allow criticism.

Both sides biases. try remember that.  Fuckin seriously. Probably taken finished mine. Ugh. thing headlines always miss is, MS enough STAFF ICU beds? Delta surge continues, still staff handle COVID patients mass casualty event? federal program help cover costs funerals died COVID-19? one requirements death certificate shows COVID cause death?

I'm vaxxed bf isnt still hasnt asked dr okay get it.....(was treated throat cancer 26 earlier year)

I'd say maybe 10% people wear mask walmart. state vax rate super low, people give fuck others right thing. new variant popped surprised 😐 mad many people secretly passive douches. think terrible decision makers live south, actually risk catching COVID outdoors very, low apart super crowded spaces. stuff like zoo swimming pool A-OK.

And even child catch it, nearly 100% certain suffer badly it. 1 Mississippi, 2 Mississippi, 3 Mississippi…. Rugged individualists ! wear orange black ride Harley's. Next, they'll carry Trump cards. 😂 yeah there’s difference 33,000 1.32 million 😂😂

/s Desantis (and allies) point reports like one linked Florida Texas added jobs June. They'll say despite COVID, hospitals stayed open, death rates low, economy outperformed states. I'm defending guy, they'll use come election need look statistics, talking ass. 

for population 5m, less 3k infected, grand total less 30 deaths. 
extrapolate western shithole statistics, many confirmed positives would saved suffering? 
if good math, tell math  small study, 49 people tested. think smoking weed would’t benefits harms lungs, organs covid attacks. CBD oil would better study fact approved peers. Reuters doesn’t use word “only” part headline. Reporting 58% vs 67% vs 87% different “only 59%.” Vaccine mandate mask mandate either live real world fantasy world strategy takes place. choice. best world! Mid February started preparing, late February asked family stop going public. based happening China. Anyone kept could see beyond previous viruses. 

And swear, LAST day Trump essentially said shutting down, EVERYONE told crazy. 2 days sent us home work, told fear mongering saying think coming work traveling. remember coworker gotten back Florida laughing child fever sent school anyways. 

It’s wild see world deny reality, make much willing investigate things own. still want science, data, statistics—but remember even CDC refused shit months, said didn’t need masks. 

It’s really wonder population divided confused. happened “right” side conspiracy theory. conservatives saw cluster fuck government even World levels far best way communicate unfortunately ended wrong side.

God speed. similar number flu? you? Also, it’s worth calling explicitly study ran September, 2020 February, 2021, appears include impact delta virus children.  Kids people. Covid highly dangerous older adults. Dang chickens coming home roosting such. Beaumont Michigan reported 0.6% hospitalized patients Vaccine Flu killed kids 2018 tuna died covid throughout whole pandemic. studies distinguish symptomatic asymptomatic? kids died flu 2018 US kids died covid whole pandemic.

Building testosterone helps limit duration  Although levels common infectious diseases 'flu, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) other, coughs colds unusually low 2020-2021 winter due school closures social distancing, risk bounce back hard coming years.

This certainly proven true parts US. There's labor shortage, there's wage shortage. Plus smallpox doesn’t asymptomatic transmission mean Thailand 20% people gotten even one dose vaccine, Indonesia 17%? Even got perfect 100% effective vaccine, delta still gonna plow right 80% population that's vaccinated all.  someone extensively studied wireless emergency alert system, good use. Alert fatigue thing _will_ lead people turning alerts. urgent (I'm talking minutes seconds act) alerts sent out, people receive got this. theoretical; known happen.  US regulatory framework lessons thalidomide ingrained DNA. hampering quick response. made worse covid dangerous kids. take bit issue last statement- “people willfully contracted preventable infection.”

There plenty people unable get vaxxed even though may want to, young another medical condition. people also catch virus waiting get second dose. Vx protects serious illness, it’s also possibly fully-vaxxed person may catch virus end needing hospitalization. pretty weak immune system, though autoimmune condition (and therefore fully vaccinated), know could well get (had Covid vaccine available) could bad, maybe even worse before. I’m upset mom won’t get vaccinated, even though time did. 

Yes, it’s perfectly understandable get angry people perfectly able get vaccinated don’t, ones getting sick hospitalized. Heh. presumably actual chance getting infected, much higher unvaccinated people vaccinated people, even vaccinations arent 100%. Basic maths.  Well time update hospitals. aging growing population profit health care system. Also percentage beds covid patients. question. Cardiac arrest patients filling beds also. think key stop reserving vaccines people aren’t going get them. Yes. 100% vaccination would ideal however people haven’t gotten point, simply aren’t going to. I’m sure there’s extenuating circumstances vast majority it. Short story made long, send rest doses countries. 10 patients hospital unvaccinated. Mask up, get vaccinated get tested.

Do actually mean 9 10 **of patients** unvaccinated? still get Covid transmit even vaccinated. happened me. Gotta stick masks well.  believe misreading chart. uses ""estimates"" directly contradicts reports CDC estimates. wit: 

[CDC today reported one new seasonal flu-related death child occurred 2019-2020 season, bringing total number flu deaths children reported CDC last season 188. matches highest recorded number pediatric flu deaths reported regular flu season, occurred 2017-2018 flu takes month die ventilator. mean, you’d prove religious beliefs actually hold view. little research found church formally told patrons take vaccine it’ll interesting people come try use excuse find church isn’t actually holding opinion point time  joke question. Lakota used word”háu” greeting men men.  Hollywood turned “how “. fine. Masks highly effective flu. Yeah, unforced error. oxygen. Governor give fuck us. overflow gets experience untreated COVID death toll.

Back things started, highest risk people seeing 33% mortality, lower risk people seeing 5%. thing got rate flattening curve learning treat disease. curve blown treatment unavailable mortality rate shoot right back up. America founded principle rabid individualism PCR nasal test capture inactivated activated virus, including virus nay destroyed immune response. Wow 15 people came back dead March Arkansas. also going protect delta variant. vaccine will. Yeah maybe maybe people blamed Trump doritos chief telling every media outlet March somehow virus disappear Easter ... like sort goddamn miracle.

Lots American care, almost equal number dumbass white house time. crapshoot. got pretty sore arm first dose Pfizer expecting much worse second dose (since everybody says second doses mRNA vaccines worse), pleasantly surprised woke next morning felt fine.

The Mississippi Department Health tracks exact bed counts availability constant basis. data used “find,” available beds patients transferred. *exact* number total beds ICU beds (Occupied, Unoccupied, “COVID-19,” Occupied) available Wow remote is. Pretty nice  mask mandate Apr 2020, really high compliance (I think ever saw someone maskless indoors, even outdoors people wearing masks).

We dropped mandate mid-June August 2nd, and... everyone continued wearing masks. ""I paid smile; going look it!"" Yay Memphis soon still dont lot cases live Canada (about 200 per day 7 million people 300k population city) plan go cabin wood 10 friends asked fully vaccinated.

December last year obviously sick Covid patient would told go s9emwhere else tested Covid. Like… wtf? 🎶 Mississippi, find another country part of…. 🎶  mean.. it’s like republicans can’t lose voters.

Dems really need stop republicans really share source UK breakthrough infections requiring hospitalization?

Do source includes vaccinated two rounds? confounding variable UK large numbers people delayed getting second dose? country properly functioning public health care system, ""hospitalization"" mean thing US going hospital reason means end life financially? Israel, data-tracking agreement Pfizer, like US terms administered vaccines. Excellent point well.  Fair enough... we're shitty situation gotta make tough choices. making stupid one...everything grey area days. Hope stay healthy good trip! Definitely interested seeing death outcomes. Deaths lagging u believe makes sense far due quicker escalation case risings. 94 grandma positive asymptomatic COVID July 2020. sharp tack. rapid cognitive decline died December 2020. heartbreaking infuriating. Please also consider natural immunity perfect.

If someone full blown AIDS gets vax, body great job providing immunity; far, 1% vaccinated gotten breakthrough infection, serious side effects within 1% rare. ~650 cases today, remember, SiNoVaC BaD! me, great aunt uncle got covid weeks ago even though vaccinated. ended hospital aunt put ICU ventilator. uncle released days ago fine, aunt still ventilator. scares hoped vaccine, happen unfortunately new variant, does. 😟 blind faith honesty average anti-vaxxer. turned burgers ~50 cases.  Another way phrase one every 8,000 kids gets die. Obviously like age groups, idk, still great? Agreed. also wish demographics people given. cause death Covid complications counting someone died car accident breakthrough infection. people died 80? immune compromised? It’s relevant understanding risk isn’t shared.  Billionaires blasting space serfs thrown street pandemic. point going mass psychotic break shit going go crazy place. 

It's genuinely shocking lack concern governments citizens. financial well-being, mental well-being... think pretty safe say government taken measures whatsoever protect people's mental health. 

Maybe I'm living bubble, feels like we're one bad news cycle away (ie. virus evolved vaccines useless) things exploding. They're probably running space thus triaging potential in-patients.

Thus...slowing down.  sIdEs!1 Also there’s reason kids can’t wear masks valves one else wearing masks isn’t mask mandate. know “look different” least breathe easier even effective paper cloth masks . bad didn’t contract tracing ability track 462,000 people denied Covid reality didn’t want talk health officials (err, *deep state government operatives*). 

How exactly data supposed gathered? People tested, contract tracing wasn’t done. Everyone likes talk Uk India drop offs six weeks.

Well, it’s people changed behavior.

Florida ain’t changing shit, it’s going stop 6 weeks… I'm trying find peer-reviewed data shows percentage covid cases severe (because saw anti-vaxxer's comment irritated wanted provide data) reason I'm trouble finding lol. 

Is information gotten pushed back speak massive amount studies done covid?  Moderna/Pfizer released results yet studies age cohort. believe they're set published end summer, go-ahead \~5-12 vaccinations soon. vaccine children 12 trials. stage 3 think. hasnt presented federal government approval. least US. from?
request approval expected come early september, approval take least month sure downvotes. see links studies? Rare impossible two different things; difference pronounced hundreds millions people get infected create mutants.  reported since June 2021 cases became 1000 + day moment, cases back less 1000. 

Delta transmissible Lamda/Gamma deadlier though maybe Delta hasn’t yet sunk teeth Chile

Chile considering booster shot though amidst Delta honestly
what brands considering anyway think.. things happening could still require ICU beds, Covid. What’s going happen almost fatal wreck comes there’s ICU keep them?

I’m gonna fine “real world” don’t worry 😂 agree. grandmother currently ER (3 days now) they’re overcrowding ICU. severe dementia. vaccinated March.  He’s absolutely wrong using outdated data. You’re right redditors want pretend anomaly instead ongoing trend. Agreed. Catching cold flu cost part society. I’ll happily take chance getting sick certainty wear mask everywhere. True.

I’m opposed it, it’s case right now. certainly don’t blame anyone wanting get tested piece mind, don’t think another person make feel guilty so. understand feelings worrying something ruined. important someone’s life? course not. think feelings valid acknowledge it’s tough situation. believe personal freedom, anyone else's Sturgis lasts two full weeks, plenty people stay four weeks. one state Texas beds him.

This crazy, confirm least Houston. I’m firefighter paramedic HFD, transport patient one hundred something hospitals here, call “base station” (staffed duty HFD medics) check status hospital patient needs. *For months now, every hospital divert.* 

“Divert” status means don’t staff don’t beds. Ever since pandemic started ramping spring 2020, we’ve running joke say : “when everyone’s divert, *no one’s* divert.” 

I don’t want ramble many hospitals Houston, it’s biggest city Texas, 4th largest city US. We’re really spread out, several skylines. One skylines “the Texas medical center,” it’s exactly sounds like: freaking skyline hospitals . . . they’re divert. say did, speaking general. 4 kids. 10 year old 6 year old triplets. Two kids healthy issues could wear mask school won’t mandate it. One autism cp won’t wear mask. sing songs can’t talk reason him. gets frustrated started hitting us last year. needs school bad can’t send him. daughter Trach bad airway collapses. seizures g tube ton complications. wheel chair.

We doctor write home hospital school since three triplets born chronic lung disease. oldest saying high risk siblings. way get stuff home schooling since nti.

You may able something similar. Best luck you. many children get advanced diagnostic work done determine damage like internal scarring see long COVID cases adults?

I’m certainly really far expert stuff, possibility lifelong consequences highly infectious virus doesn’t seem worth handwaving away symptoms root cause symptoms could potentially life changing.

This isn’t say don’t believe institution like King’s College. situation seems change rapidly I’m wary letting single study’s results determine entire outlook dangers posed children virus. Nope.

Nor massive temp contracts medical labor.

Turns out, doctors nurses willing run 150% long, it’s back regular work weeks.  I’m sorry hear truly hope recovers completely. 

It’s like common thing talk kids COVID, someone like “Yeah 350 kids died”. 

I wish publicity around cases like this, people watched way many medical dramas TV seem think don’t end dead 100% fine. Everyone shows recovers completely, like illness accident never happened, meanwhile reality that’s simply always true. I've left house total nineteen times since March 18 2020. Every one excursions something absolutely necessary survival (food medicine getting vaccinated). went dentist crown sometime April 2020, that's riskiest thing I've done.

I *cannot* get disease, I'm likely suffer massively it. reason due lingering complications (""just"") flu. best resources have. fault hospital triage situation. 

I suppose there's anyone department who's worked military health care? train people think this-- give best care provide staff resources available. can't blame caring patients tent Iraq instead major hospital stateside. 

If gave best care could provide circumstances made sure leadership knows shortages, that's enough. Please beat fix macro pandemic mess ER shift.  Even something endemic, make sense change behavior significant infection growth rates seen atop baseline rate.

At point, folk who've naturally vaccinely developed immunity CoViD least likely die pre-CoViD. But, everybody it, vaxxed, future variants less likely deadly (though can't guaranteed even future case).

Overall, CoViD likely lead permanent, country wide mandates, didnt', even peak. This!! That’s good news! look Kansas City you’ll see isn’t accurate. Springfield slowing doesn’t mean rest state. 7 day one day didn’t increase 7 day average previous 30 today hit new record wave. Nothing says slowing except random redditors. school held meeting parents voted wearing masks school still going make kids wear masks. Younger 12. much Delta Chile ?  live society

**BOTTOM TEXT** elderly vaccinated 75+ percent contribute 95 percent deaths.   Probably. they’re walking it’s like give fuck license fair though, *this close* comes polio.

That said, cannot bring accepting vaccine. 
It's like consciousness allow feel safe so. point time.
I'll best, mask up. Sanitize get tests done. live that.
For vast majority, mean vast, covid one n done. ppl fully recover. numbers lie.
It's 99 percent recovery rate. words deny fact. Why? true, breakthrough infection quite common. Look uk numbers see plenty vaccinated hospitalizations deaths. rare. 1 percent. percentages hospital right decently vaccinated state higher absurd numbers.

The vaccine incredibly effective. perfect, need lie it. Sturgis bit different simple concert even weekend festival it’s long - two full weeks plus pre-parties post-parties another two weeks. 

So gives extra time virus circulate. Numbers double twice time. 

Also, it’s nearly half million people almost every state. 

It’s definitely outlier “events” go. Yea I’ve getting offered pick shifts like 150/hr can’t assed. It’s awful right now. Get shots people. numbers pretty good vaccinated folks. way plunged simultaneous worldwide rewrite basics interpersonal interaction fairly unprecedented (what I've seen similar masking rules 1918 pandemic went weeks, years), lack quantifiable endpoint makes adventures like Iraq Afghanistan wars better analogues. trudged quagmires quite long time hardly reshaped society grand scale.

What suggesting prevail maybe we've many, many years learning live COVID, get truly exhausted counting cases every winter, frenzied politicization masks loses fervor. ubiquity truly prevails normal today's children, born world never knew school without them, kids maybe taking mask become act generational rebellion. reason might take decades ""what long-term effects?"" seems court public opinion we're going get used dodging SARS-CoV-2 cost then.

I make long, that's probably take truly revert us pre-2020 normality vaccines failed get us there.  operations manager work, imposed mask mandate effective today, suddenly excused finished day home found exposed covid-19 three days ago. fully vaccinated friend his, works restaurant industry, became symptomatic (described symptoms kick chest irritating cough subsided couple days) tested positive. 

The manager, also fully vaccinated, asymptomatic isolating anyway per CDC guidance pending PCR test. situation definitely irritating nobody likely end hospital it. Anti vaxx nurses licenses pulled. Period. Enjoy hypochondria. Yes do. trip Europe next month possibility false positive asymptomatic positive giving bit anxiety. Wish they’d waive requirement vaccinated travelers. know, that's thinking of. stand corrected. Sadly, much U.S. population seems helped immensely establish country ""Global Headquarters"" SARS-CoV-2 virus grow thrive. virus seems ""love"" estimated [118.2 people US, age 12 over, fully vaccinated. 
        
I surprised COVID-19 epidemic US continues thrive across multiple waves coming months, seasons, years, US possibly becoming last remaining country world still new COVID-19 cases deaths. 
     
On August 4, CDC updated latest COVID-19 ensemble forecasts number new cases number new deaths forecast occur US 4 weeks August 1 August 28. 
      
For US, CDC ensemble forecast projects ""[350,000 1.8 new cases likely reported week ending August 28, 2021.""   
      
For US, CDC ensemble forecast projects ""that number newly reported COVID-19 deaths likely increase next 4 weeks, [2,300 new deaths likely reported week ending August 28, 2021.""   
     
For US, latest (July 28) IHME COVID-19 Projections forecasting total [16,273 new 4 weeks August 1 August 28.   
      
The forecasts guarantees, unfortunately paint possible bleak dismal future U.S. population U.S. economy. 68 year old dad caught Covid last year experiencing significant cognitive decline. It’s heartbreaking watch. can’t make coffee, make oatmeal remember he’s doing. ..so, half childish assholes, thing half childish spoiled assholes?

That's pretty spot on, yes. childish spoiled assholes problem. Sure, first three months, shame China. Last 18 months, shame us. Oh no, hope get better. somebody explain logic me? vaccinated people spreading it, protected. still get variants eventually, right?  I’ve deeply downvoted comments topic (maybe due nostalgia factor?), really feel Barbie presents women’s faces way that’s great. understand it’s doll, it’s stylized, supposed natural/realistic, think could showing range shapes sizes dolls’ facial features, example broad noses, smaller eyes, different mouth shapes etc. Since she’s marketed aspirational/a role model, would cool see. I’m glad they’ve taken step healthier direction though body types.  thing would justify obliteration middle class, massive emotional mental trauma worldwide scale, forced vaccinations participate society, people dropping dead streets common occurrence. isn't. Lockdown mistake, virus big deal, otherwise we'd way measly 600,000 deaths America. People posting like researchers profiting hard work novelty...

This huge gotcha. She’s 44?? Looks 55.... maybe taking care diet health.... 
Obesity sugar major health issue states. 
Also cancer kills 2,500 people day one gives crap that...this world messed  three. Occam's razor Ya delve studies, vaccine errors common around administration dates always providers control. Lack supplies patients showing appointments inflate number. also see vaccines strict regiments rabies higher rates vaccination administration errors even providers fault. Barbie busy life. kinda wanna see Self-Care Barbie comes sweatpants takeout menu. That's they're saying. report data last 6 months that's long shots available public. Next month they'll say lasts 7 months, 8 months, etc. right away opened general public mass vaxx site fast easy. site running like well oiled machine literally 5 minutes walking door sitting waiting area. that's much inconvenience save life life someone else need recheck frickin priorities. Sending love - Lyme fucking horrific Chinese government allowed international flights continue Wuhan local airports... awesome, i’m following account hole you’ll continue post studies looking this. interesting stuff, thank you!! Good point, passed onto everyone else. genuine opinion unvaccinated COVID patients shouldn’t treated that’s far people. delta boosters general boosters?  mean that’s determine first via trails right?  Idk get vaccine without parents knowing, let get exactly done now. upload proof, addition testing needed, get QR code scanned. knows play out. Another anecdote, wife month ~4 fully vaccinated Moderna we're day 6 breakthrough infections unvaccinated individual. 

Other little tickle throats we're fine. trying keep kids (too young vaccinated) getting it. already owned pulse ox we've keeping tabs we're stayed 97.

The unvaccinated person exposed slightly worse symptoms. sore throat, headache/lightheadedness, aches. know oxygen levels. understand you’re coming from, really do. service members joined military actively defend rights freedoms, deserve respect. 

However, sing military, things get tricky rights.

Technically rights granted constitution, theres different approach courts regarding military matters. important things note doctrine military necessity, also known “Orloff Rule” Orloff v. Willoughby (1953), military implement regulations largely outside purview judicial review, Court’s attitude historically “hands off.”

So, established that, declared Military Necessity, establish rules outside purview judicial U.S. military party cases centering First Amendment rights free speech, free press, free exercise religion, Supreme Court generally defers government’s interest discretion, permitting military restrict rights service personnel ways permit civilian contexts.

So, normally look precedents making judicial decisions, ignored US Military Governments Interests Discretion so. U.S. military always operated somewhat distinct society governed criminal code. currently ruled special system laws, primarily Uniform Code Military Justice (UCMJ),and system prosecuting violations code, including courts-martial.

In end, it’s military. sucks, you’re service member, follow lawful orders, maximum punishment violation failure obey lawful general order regulation dishonorable discharge, forfeiture pay allowances, confinement two years.

I hate say bluntly, specifically since friends Family military (lots them), knew singed for, one things comes territory. 

Experimental not, military liability potential loosing using Navy numbers fot example) service members there’s outbreak military. ""I can't bothered cite sources argument I'll attack adversary instead""

FTFY. Dude, dealing now. family quite big lot kids. family vaccinated. sisters kids rocking camps past weeks. Whole family going cold cold. cool I’m happy getting there. Anyways, dad lost taste Sunday, tested positive twice Monday. Family gone lock positive nephew. Contact tracing easy everyone know vaccinated tested negative. fall going suck again. husband didn’t although fatigue, otoh planet 24 hours. friend. people pfizer social circle. two 3 completely fucked. can't really get dirt cheap free!

admittedly paid taxes fund _free_ Would like injected robot? Denzel made good movie last ten years lol  way like fukt... :*( can't/don't pay bills? Course mate, I’ll reply bit, getting holes drilled teeth moment. money concern, ok say obese people? Huh, TIL 6 months since wwas available public. can't speak data exist yet.  really true. mean, rolling dice illegal state, access modern varieties, get strong fuck weed high thc, high cbd, both. interesting haven’t seen (or used, obviously) sprays. would hypothetically circumvent less effective oral route (due liver) less risk lung issues heat vaping, right?  99.9% assuming everyone equal exposure virus. It’s logic lead moronic “99.98% survival rate” arguments March 2020 literally dividing death rate population.

You need compare vaccinated unvaccinated individuals compare got sick each. looked percent unvaccinated individuals got Covid-19, would also like 96%. obviously unvaccinated doesn’t provide 96% efficacy. I'm 6th 7th month... now? someone Mississippi, ya’ll fucked Emergency care act 1986 prevents (thanks reagan), well hippocratic oath. Yes, do. you? variant would still issue US contagious is. He's calling variant preventable, isn't.

Want try without rude? Went ahead reported comment ya. vaccines offer sterilizing immunity? haven’t able find data studies supporting claim, links would much appreciated :) tradition. That's terrifying sad. made far, well staffed. got 2.5k hospitalized patients Netherlands (population 17m) healthcare system strained close breaking. actually much better success rate expected, thanks. really thought pulling 25-50k value nowhere.

Having done risk modeling nuclear power sector, often assign operators fairly high failure rates need to, say, flip right switches right order. That's conservative, account stress, course. 

But medicine data exists, I'm happy we've almost definitely assuming operators way failure prone actually are. stats DELTA? news, standing hail bullets mean bulletproof vests work, pointless equip. Agree. fully vaccinated ready live life surge delta hit us (I’m Texas). soon goes back stays little while, I’ll go back normal. I’m masking going back grocery delivery, etc. get vaccinated want say “screw everyone isn’t vaccinated,” wish would stop giant surges.  unvaccinated toddler currently sick Covid - along vaccinated in-laws. sucks badly. No, would either pay surcharge lose Medicaid. It’s like states haven’t charged Medicaid premiums before. Care elaborate then? may better measures efficacy, still seems pretty useful trying account behind, experiencing bulk current surge. Especially efficacy one size fits number. located Canada, wait little bit much booked soon could first dose long waiting period. Found could switched it, system little different think. Still shocked thinking fully vaccinated 7 months already, feel like long. Trust father young kids feel frustration reason wasn’t asked sooner specifically requesting due link rare heart condition typically affecting 30 called pericarditis wasn’t linked vaccines June. Also isn’t unusual drug approvals, start small group possible case there’s widespread issues, expand required FDA new information concerns come up. Sucks it’s supposed work. exactly everyone eligible should. don't, clearly care anyone beyond nose. We're eye shitticane. tell I’ll keep measuring. Think like ""hey, 6 months study still seeing strong antibodies"" ""we got 6 months stopped checking"" Arkansas Mississippi democratic candidates: ""So saying there's chance?"" got J&amp;J early April, got symptoms yourself, miserable day. really made feel people actually caught COVID. ventilators used last resort vs early pandemic tossed everyone them, makes sense  Perhaps least part due viral loads significantly larger infected people. testing right now, don’t yet know more. death rate low idiots like you. low thanks hard working people everything power prevent pandemic getting worse. want help, reap benefits? don’t understand medical staff treat anyone Covid patient able get shots didn’t. Go pull bootstraps treat yourself, asshole. Hasn’t CBD studied long time? quote based on. worded Bancel, Chief Executive Officer Moderna. “We mRNA candidates clinical trials across five therapeutic areas including infectious diseases, cardiovascular, oncology, rare disease autoimmune disorders. pleased COVID-19 vaccine showing durable efficacy 93% six months, recognize Delta variant significant new threat must remain vigilant.”

So ***don't actually say*** mean. read implied **NOT** talking delta efficacy  Bad mod!  never seen mentioned. reason moderna's dosage three times higher? Note pre Delta. literally tested positive 2 Moderna shots 4 months ago.   Like seeing numbers going up! talked 5+ friends black, one's afro-carribean none got covid vaccine shot. main reason trust government. feel republican thing government lying ethnic people past. tried saying ok, makes sense hesitant January evidence 99.99% people intubation unvaccinated, still get it? 
Again comes trust government lost trust. got second shot end may, gotta back 1 2 shots end November? time odd's incorrect dilution vaccine distributed widely pretty low. 

It also requires demanding refrigeration system, temperatures must maintained, chain. Moderna's refrigeration requirements far less demanding.

There lot variables could potentially impact Pfizer's efficacy manufacturing injection, Moderna face (same J&amp;J). assume every single chain along way error free good way approach this. weird! I'm 20s pretty fine Moderna, needed lot sleep. Haven’t read report yet said exact opposite — called durable immunity. is. zero reason say change 94% efficacy 93% efficacy “waning,” that’s patently ridiculous — that’s *well* within error measurement. Zero chance that’s actually significant change. might true Covid Alpha. proving true new variants. We're seeing increasing numbers healthy people 30s 40s severe Covid cases even dying. black white, either. 'full recovery' 'death'. Long covid lung, heart, brain issues impacting much younger folks. fat, old people trouble.

My hope others lazy vaccination see increased risk non-elderly healthy folks get vaccianted. don’t think political power make us something that’s foreign us. “fixing” problem start personal personal responsibility recognizing us little voice telling us fuck neighbor, selfish, get someone beats us it… recognizing takes power away would try use create barbaric society live in. Helping others intrinsic using abusing others, it’s makes humans unique- it’s battle need within every minute every day, good news always choose right thing. many choose cynical path end monsters, that’s we’re letting people die go brunch, even deep personal sacrifices many us made. believe call N formula, right? nicotine industry known paying doctors say cigarettes good lung health. yeah, skepticism warranted.  understand vaccinated person get delta variant? bad feeling Great Resignation followed Great Return Work Lower Pay Worse Benefits. know totally different vaccine approved use animals? It’s explained article. They’re taking vaccine away people vaccinate animals. literally zero negative impact people third world (or anywhere). Cleared who? vaccines cleared safe use yet? 7 month club here. Getting plane tonight scared shitless.  Sure unless dose diluted consequence pretty low. Maybe billions doses 25k-50k properly diluted. concern sure, small factor almost worth thinking unless job reduce risk mishandling. hard, willpower necessarily problem. I've found easier I'm therapy - we're getting actual causes beating willpower anymore.  I’m sure wife kids would appreciate sassy comment, brings great joy. show them!    Older generations much higher vaccination rates reduced risk severe illness. natural reproductive number virus itself. huge number vaccination immunity needed keep control.

I clarify list R's viruses natural R (R0 scientific terms) final value factoring vaccines. Sorry confusion.  President United States probably referring situation within United States. Shit. mine finished May, means need booster next month exist? way could prevented. mean kind treatment procedure people could used substationally lower risk contracting covid. Oh well. It’s stupid question all. Truthfully don’t understand it. listen media expert decide correct. people actually want understand what’s going on. evidence vaccine stops spread, help people get sick terms spreading herd immunity… Yeah, think that's pretty weak excuse. Obviously first make appointments, recent months get many places. picking prescription buying toilet paper, take extra 20 minutes get right pharmacy! Even back working 60 hours week school online, could spared 20 freaking minutes.  intent phrase say ""not problem got vaccine"". 

It really matter intention absolutely vast majority vaccinated people interpreted it.  one HUGE advantage mRNA vaccines naturally acquired immunity mRNA vaccines target ACE2 protein COVID-19, KNOWN CORONAVIRUSES, use enter cell. mRNA vaccines offer significant level efficacy known coronaviruses. Natural immunity coronaviruses appears variant-specific may protect mutant varieties delta.

These statements correct. First mRNA vaccine target ACE2, ACE2 human protein virus uses enter cell, vaccine targets viral spike protein distinct SARS-Cov2 coronaviruses. Secondly, ACE2 entry receptor known coronaviruses. Yes, entry receptor SARS SARS-Cov2 example MERS uses receptor DPP4 entry receptor (and that's mention thousands species use receptors). 

Comparing natural immunity vaccine immunity complicated immunity vaccines appears generating much stronger antibody response also targeting single protein (again spike protein) natural immunity polyclonal potentially could neutralizing targeting proteins besides spike. could theoretically make natural immunity better broader protection protection escape variants, really known viruses arise (if do). vaccines holding well currently epitopes spike protein changed enough prevent antibody binding reduce therefore high levels elicited vaccine still able neutralize natural antibodies lower titers may harder time lower levels. It’s admit they’re wrong might wrong stuff can’t be. already happened friend's grandfather (vaccinated), needed ICU bed get one since full due covid. Eventually one opened up, able help grandfather, sounded like least happy chance say good bye since many us opportunity lockdown (my grandmother passed, able say farewell person). shows 6 open ICU beds MS. Ya like comparing apples oranges. People autoimmune diseases ability regulate antibody responses bodies average vaccinated person. situation - Masking distancing next 3 years? true now. breeding ground makes breakthrough cases higher, plus chance mutation variants like Lambda even vaccine resistant Delta. get information? today, US administered 194.7 million Pfizer doses versus 139.5 million Moderna doses. Yea sure, vaccinated americans' fault. Everyone saying vaccines work reach certain percentage population vaccinated, left part. average American excuse vaccinated point.   literally hoping moderna better Pfizer stress less? Individualistic priorities best, hope realize tone-deaf statement  True, front-line, however think redditor concerned circulating neutralizing antibodies. Agreed. bullshit ought object to. understand people finger-wagging anti-vaxers sanctimoniously ought follow science come defense osteopathic manipulation. know sounds callus, ZERO sympathy. told do, chose ignore it. Time adult deal consequences stupid ass decision. shouldn’t get resources. “It’s flu” say shouldn’t worry stay home.

I’ve lost sympathy morons deserve get point. It’s 0.3 haven’t seen great stats long COVID hospitalization rates. philosophy bit now. us access internet greatest amount knowledge human history (not mention speed access). people choosing, making deliberate decision believe incorrect harmful information despite mountain evidence. real high day started thinking fundamentalist religious people believe end times coming raptured. wealthy powerful christians using pandemic, road climate change, try bring end times.  Yes. Knowing two healthcare workers Rogers myself... don’t assume healthcare workers aren’t Covid deniers... Yep recommended check Sister teacher GA Covid first hit. really like it, use questions please DM learning curve thing first look crazy overwhelming get groove pretty nice.  
Also clubs virtual field trips covid drops kids sports local brick mortar public schools nice. Cough cough really hard understand booster third dose going needed, don’t really want wait around government finally pull trigger recommending one. Uhm, ipso facto columbo oreo - *any* person catching COVID *worse* experience unvaccinated. take risk all? That’s obvious. studies show reduced protection seems like antibodies play role symptomatic infection. None would stop scenario. seeing 9+ month reports instead rehashing 6 month ones data available March?

The placebo groups longer exist (they would mostly vaccinated now), efficacy reports 6 months going happen trials. They're probably wanted put whatever recent good news quarterly report. took brainwashed, unvaccinated mother-in-law hospital Covid, completely understand sentiment.

We furious blame mess, time still want get care. hard week wife, works healthcare public advocate vaccines. 

In end, wish push vaccine mandates federal government. Children thrown harms way, people trying force blame misguided governors. feel like federal government more. furious too! comes time start rationing healthcare, really hope unvaccinated people put bottom list. People love hate cities, despite cities economic engines country. 

For example, residents small towns Illinois regularly complain Chicago gets much money compared anywhere else state, nevermind fact Chicago generates proportionately tax revenue uses proportionately less per capita. 

The problem rural suburban areas tend hamstring stupid development patterns make difficult sustain local businesses generate tax revenues needed cover local expenses. result, areas constantly strapped cash one invest them.

As costs go up, rural suburban regions need proportionately subsidy. locals often cannot afford higher taxes due expenses (like travel costs) due poverty, simply want higher taxes. So, state level, people vote lower taxation, even develop communities require substantial subsidies maintain, get angry cities subsidizing enough taxes low, voted for. studies prove true. people virus still easily pass virus. lied sides. mainly people don’t want end hospital, entire human race Well shit bet look really cool motorcycle. Everyone probably thinks awesome loudly drive can't basic conversation noise. Things could get really really bad next month so. cases seem Florida Texas deep south. peak hurricane season states affected them. happens people ventilators hurricane hits Houston? happens people need shelter place like super dome? doubt they’re going turn away people symptomatic midst natural disaster. 

It could honestly situation like saw India last year. states playing fire. could walk across street right get another shot. don’t care local grocery store pharmacy, state isn’t keeping records like probably should. admit, it’s tempting, don’t want new improved booster come able take couple months. It’s getting frustrating little communication this. (Parent vaxxed over-12 impatient under-12.) numbers hand. official Covid deaths US June 6th 2021: 590,000 --- total excess deaths time frame: 640,000. discrepancy clear, crass could be. excuse I've heard often ""You still get covid even vaccinated bother""
There's reasoning. read terrible triage typo right could intubate. Double Greek way Ok Pfizer. need send vaccines used instead wasting time trying convince people get. course be, it? money hungry people top. basis upon contradict sources DO's they've assure additional education spinal manipulation purely science based? heard similar lines reasoning before... Thank you! son stay safe too. vaccines prevalent, felt terrible people ended hospital covid. game changed, vaccines readily available developed countries hear unvaccinated person one countries hospitalized, feel sympathy think ""you're , enjoy karma scarred lungs"". sympathies go toward suffering countries still struggling get hands enough vaccines. Yes believe lots people struggle basic steps ""identify problem, prioritize solution, execute"". people complain house filthy/unsafe never get around cleaning/fixing it. used proactive something involves health wellbeing. always ""getting by""... They've 18 months build additional units. Agree 100% think lot friends (in America) like wouldnt vatients anti vaxxers would get vaccine. true, need look globally. people ask people countries matter, why. Variants continue help one another. articles I’m reading get so
confusing contradict million times. keeps going along lines of:

Title: Younger people 40 demographic getting hit Delta variant getting severe illness 

Inside article: “there clear correlation younger people affected virus” 

….what???? it?? ah. wrongfully assumed US. Best luck. stay safe. mom selfish cold person. understand it, guess. family same. realize end game highly effective vaccines available high risk want them, there's nothing else fall back on?  

Society going tolerate never-ending rolling lockdowns, restrictions, masking virus relatively low risk children working-age adults. isn't. speak way he's treated all, ridiculous inhumane...but he's intern surgical resident definitely surgeries year anyway. Now, might spending time OR, issue right now...but he's month residency ICU, well 1) fucking kudos him, cuz interns thrown ICU first month medschool illegal...and 2) still ton time get hours. 

(This is, course, assuming he's US medschool grad US residency. Since residency calendar began beginning July) Another unvaccinated person claiming waiting get it. Seriously, vaccinating everywhere everyday available! don’t make priority cuz don’t want it. want it, care health, would take 15 min day it. It’s months since became readily available. can’t take train drive way 20 min get it, stupid. need start calling people bs. works. Antibodies entire story mosaic body's immunity response system.  to, know can't contain, climb astronomical numbers yeah strains progress fast enough serious damage countries behind vaccination, people 2-3 shots ahead resistance may asymptotic neighbor went Sturgis last year, shortly returning girlfriend got COVID -- die holed miserable month, basically get bed, force eat everything tasted gross. Healthcare workers first get vaccines countries also. Unfortunately correct. Abbott cares winning reelection next year won't, allow local governments, take steps save lives piss ignorant base.

Things seemed getting back something akin normal too, sigh . . . Good thing florida open ice beds know thinks knows global medical community people like top doctor Canada let alone people like Fouchi whatever. can't tell someone lined pockets really daft arrogant. point trust many people early one also lost trust. pure insanity. never never reporting JJ. truly forgotten media lol studies available yet research ongoing. Pfizer study released preliminary results antibody levels 10-15 times higher persons receiving third dose. vaccine ever caused long term effects result boosters initial doses; side effects immediately felt.

I'm getting third dose 1pm today part Pfizer study. 1/3 chance get reduced dose, 1/3 chance get full dose 1/3 chance get booster South African variant. Pfizer following people like since 2020.  Recovering cold put 12 days get clear.  Vaccine roll slow Australia first chance get it.  Flu lasts season year. Others years long Average percentage almost meaningless COVID mostly affects elderly. tests efficacy made different strain, environment people still socially distanced wore masks. Anyone logic realised this. Yep phase 3 Correct, [Delta first recorded [5 Oct India. time, vaccine clinical trials ongoing. India began vaccinations [16 January Yes, however, illustrating delta could much worse kids, much know yet. 

And since constant refrain many people is, dangerous kids, time stop saying that. answer right know. rise least. 

So people talk need continue wear masks, complain unvaccinated, well thats kids. Data starting show impact. rather dismiss dangerous kids, time act caution comes kids. Like know maybe wear masks indoors school.  infections make children ill

Are people know this? children get severely ill COVID mean can't ever happen. What's important actual chances child becoming ill. cases surging, little incidence children catching COVID. Therefore, key keep cases moderately low order keep children getting ill. means asymptomatic subset confirmed.

I that's reasonable reading document, since we've looked daily reports, know asymptomatic infections subset confirmed case criteria completely different ones linked before.

I think going drive crazy trying figure exactly symptoms required various times early pandemic considered ""confirmed case."" think general outline suspected/confirmed cases asymptomatic infections clear us now, stop flogging dead horse. Yeah agree. 4 days today. Glad saved masks gonna say detour SD Iowa lovely time year.  think anyone run president little narcissistic. Both. seriously - seatbelt airbag? /s Florida also big part wave cases happened last year around July/August well southern states. hard pinpoint many changing variables, south seems likely spread Covid summer northern states.

A lot states fine. Stupid people getting vaccine, leaders saying vaccine bad willing enforce problems - that's problem.

You're nutso. blocked. Thank much anon redditor(s) awards! unvaccinated contagious? steroid reduce inflammation lungs reversed vaccinated unvaccinated. 81% vaccinated. No, official report. Pfizer moderna said 3rd booster shot 6 months facilitates “robust immunity” delta variant. phase 2 trail dosing pattern like Definitely, raising great points reality kids school. problem (in eyes) know affects kids 15. risk keep increasing? Level off?

I'm lucky family *really* take masking seriously, even kids. can't imagine they're wearing masks 10+ hours, (from hear teachers). 

The second problem we're swayed easily personal experiences - maybe that's concern comes from. close family member pretty bad reaction (not heart-related) we're concerned odds. genetic? Totally random? wish choices kids could feel comfortable giving family members something ""damned do, damned don't"". AZ J&amp;J would great we're looking approve kids anytime soon. 

I think better question give male teens one dose. Many myocarditis reports notably came second one, one shot still gives limited immunity. not. fucking moron, spread virus infecting people based viral load. person whose body virus reproduced less, spread virus much. Hence, spread reduced. how, back then, found covid particles survive surfaces, conclusion made chance infection surfaces almost 0. Sorry say ""America"" divided one political party going antivax fanatic followers. decided support vaccination instead. problem.

Maybe allow political party sell vaccines followers eventually fixed  I'm sure that's true. 100% correlated political party, ~11% difference vaccination percentages counties Biden vs Trump. lefties want vaccination/are anti vax - hell yeah. data clearly showing political affiliation strong indicator vaccine uptake. Flu shot needs booster every year. Rabies needs 7. point trash now? slow vaccine rollout gives virus plenty time evolutionary pressure adapt vaccine. We'll vaccine IP lifted entire world infrastructure giant push vaccinate time. Given pharmaceutical companies government profitable bi-yearly vaccine suspect we'll living Covid long time.

Some interesting prep guidelines says invert 10 times (don't shake), adding saline. off-white, use see particle matter

Moderna says swirl, shake (or invert like Pfizer) initially drawing doses. white off-white color may contain white translucent particles.
Do use liquid contains particulate matter discolored. consider information believe. truly believe COVID real vaccine way controlling brain, refusing vaccine would make sense. Much way mowing lawn would unreasonably dangerous believed lawns always fire. absurd premises, show much good information matter. 

(I grant bad logic well, e.g. gotten yet, therefore can't get it. fallacy would imply everyone immortal. So, yeah...No.) Netherlands live company ask vaccination status (or health related questions). I’d feel bit safer return office knew everyone vaccinated, fully support CNN doing.  Oops, meant 81% UNvaccinated. 19% vaccinated hospital. Sorry! Unsubscribe fault vaccinated people taking masks, blame falls CDC enacting vaccine mandates coincide mask guidance. course unvaccinated people, barely wearing masks begin with, going take masks chance get!

Like said, it’ll boost antibodies weeks. doesn’t create delta specific response. comment get deleted it’s political, one side already politicized masks one side already politicized vaccines. don’t really know why, happened it’s already this. misleading say 100 4.2 million vaccinated people died Covid Massachusetts.

No matter much want be.

(I know you’re sorry. People like never are. It’s makes people dislike attitude much)  clear, mostly outdoor festival? would appear so. Yeah got first dose Pfizer December 2020. breakthrough we're seeing Delta, eager get third dose. would face fines, fines miniscule compared number people may die variant. problem, it’s hard tell sometimes. really have, lot handled things quite poorly start too. Covid obviously potentially dangerous every age group, it’s important it’s taken seriously, headlines like penny dreadfuls. There’s way conveying seriousness matter without fearmongering think, way sensationalist. 

But lot tabloid papers guess it’s expected haha. I'm boat - vaccinated 13 year old, unvaxxed 9 year old. decided cancel car vacation vacation plane rebooked last year cancel 2020 travel. start school another month I'm optimistic.

I also live highly vaxxed state school district requiring everyone (vaxxed not) wear masks, Covid fatigue disappointment exhausting. feel like I'm third wave depression.  Im focus universal healthcare all. agree It’s like, made adult choice live die actions  agree OP, poor headline bad statistics. reality know risk catching disease moment. comes hindsight. 

However, masking optional distancing impossible classrooms odds student contracting COVID school likely high since luxury controlling environment it. Also kids kids likely mindful adult. 

I hesitant reports came out, consulted kid's Dr. own. consensus bad stuff come COVID, shot safer bet. Alabama still holding number one slot 34.6% vaccinated .  good suggestions. wish experimenting kids one them. Yes wish understood psychology better help us get people vaccinated. got premium version moderna ads prolly 6g   think extra oxygen antiVa got wearing masks year. need extra now.  people believe politicians promote idea sterilizing immunity Covid-19 vaccines. Know gal refuses vaccine, smokes like chimney. delta variant widespread, reproductive number alpha variant 4 required herd immunity threshold 75%, 70% seemed like reachable goal. delta variant widespread reproductive number 9.5, herd immunity threshold 89%. virus ever becomes infectious measles (R0 18), basically requires herd immunity 98% prevent outbreaks. indication anywhere projection is? Like cases expected peak? know difficult model, looking good news. boat you. frustrating. like family wasted almost 18 months trying stay safe nothing.

I live state mask mandates schools banned. kids (under 12 years old) started school week; 3rd grader one 3 wearing mask, 5th graders class one student masked. 

I ordered kn-95 masks wear school- hope may help little bit. /r/technicallythetruth \- say ""at least"" Neither made sick. kind wish had. wouldn’t felt bit better it. I’m sure feeling towards mutual. didn’t even read lol 🤦🏻‍♂️ went appropriate testing.
Dude say wanna take matter start production first? read article. point many countries asking employees fill form including health information vaccination status would illegal due privacy laws. think flexible approach apply, especially people providing information voluntary.  stopped “Although anecdotal stories.” Everything else said fear-mongering claptrap, might make feel little better, serves pollution tide fear hysteria. 
It’s like, moral equivalent throwing plastic ocean.  Yes, actually, are. yes work. Well done. Yup. totally expected looking Delta India UK. kinda summer fun June July cases still low.  They’re making business decision charge voluntary high risk lifestyles “If compromise child’s safety, we’ll give coupons!” absolutely require ID, [many locations around vaccine available, including several Mattapan Eastie. remotely issue access, vaccines there. deleted comment since take population differences bone pick headline, it’s OPs fault.

That's exactly it. I'm OP, headline pure drama. still true get vaccinated protect can’t? recent evidence showing us covid still transmitted rate whether vaccinated viral load same? People really want get back brunch. Little kids sacrifices they're willing risk pretend Covid over. Masks fine.

Closed schools not.

I cant predict many, any. hope 0 die.

This said. Flu hits kids harder  None relevancy said. Children getting COVID higher rate lately mean somehow dangerous Delta variant dangerous. It’s still 1 1000 require hospitalization around 1 10,000 die known (mostly symptomatic) cases. remove kids comorbidities factor asymptomatic cases go untested, odds much much lower. Louisiana really struggling. thought meant ""drain swamp."" bad symptoms? suspect may part discrepancy, though Florida hit pretty hard previous waves.  get it

It's one. He's mean actual variant preventable, current situation US easily preventable. vast vast majority unvaccinated hospitalizations deaths preventable. People need take damn vaccine far US concerned would over. going apocalypse. No.

Tell folks getting surgeries delayed folks need visit ER getting subpar care flat rejected.... good news. worry though late young enough. 

This delta wave started Arkansas Missouri. short span, Florida Louisiana Mississippi seeing crazy surge. makes think SC NC Georgia Tennessee Alabama next. delta variant us going run unvaccinated folks states. 

I hope country takes seriously see another surge like last winter. could even worse. ah damn. ok. I'd even argue may possibly see boosters every 6 months sucks I'll gladly take Compared last time got high cases, way better thanks vaccines.  keep telling ""this bump road. bump road."" Otherwise another day.  Ok? That's already thing every large metro atlanta area county. Masks required, school started back yesterday. kids mind. Need residency spots way med schools. Opening med schools without residency programs increase competition likely debt tuition get in. many kids issues. Covid affects age group least. Hopefully kids suficient vit (lets hope paranoid parents keeping behind closed door whole summer), immune system, covid put much fight..

&amp;#x200B;

The thing even facing different mutation already popuplation level antibodies, also know disease better admited hospital, already thousands patients you, doctor threated disease chances survival higher.

We looking covid way looking spring 2020.

Restriction beside masks important anymore. much stronger back then. True, considered - considering pre/post vaccine numbers fair comparison. I'll delete comment. understand it, first saw lot blood clot cases women countries started vaccinating old people (who seem particularly vulnerable) healthcare workers. Healthcare workers likely female, beginning, vulnerable people getting vector vaccines women.

The British studies AZ vaccine found men women more-or-less equally likely clotting problems vaccinated, [risk increased decreasing That's government decided offer alternative vaccine under-30s (this policy later extended cover under-40s). Yeah, that's accurate. We're furious too, shitbag. That’s literally impossible considering 330M people US don’t understand people think Florida’s worse California, Florida **four times** number cases, adjusted population?

If bone pick headline, it’s OPs fault. That’s Boca news site. Amen. Totally agree. Believe me, I'm fed shit.  illegal US well, except certain situations.

These CNN employees fired unvaccinated. fired broke company policy. CNN policy place requires employees vaccinated work office, employees attested vaccinated weren't, went office. attestation legally binding document verifies something true. unvaccinated status probably later came (office gossip?), allowed CNN legally fire them.

Good CNN. talked someone hesitated getting vaccine doctor told trust vaccine.  
It scares people HEALTH INDUSTRY. told loved hope changes mind I'm worried her. hair dresser well minority, around lot people job damn virus unfortunately affected minorities due social inequalities among things. change someone's mind DOCTOR tells this? due medical condition may have, anything would least make sort sense.. LMAO cope harder. Also, hope least flawed methodology discerning true prevented getting vaccinated. amount Wave inclines declines tell us lot epidemic societies resistance completely agree. never really cared masks/distancing relieved mask order put back place upcoming school year Illinois. Getting ppl go back tough though, even lot fully vaxxed act like babies comes putting mask back on. No, cancers prevent people getting vaccine. people may mount good immune response it.  year 2027, COVID became endemic globally across rest world point, however one zero COVID outpost still remains. 134th time Dan Andrews put Victoria back lockdown. mere 12 hours since last lockdown ok. Maybe people Melbourne one day allowed visitors round houses it’s 5 years since privilege still hold hope.  wait whaaaaaat?! HOSPITAL?! ugh im sorry! getting ridiculous. long going tolerate antivax/antimask bullshit? uncharted territory. suspect companies worried lawsuits.  I'm calling claim free market capitalism, yet insurers ultimately choice can't deny pre-existing conditions. ""Free. Market. Capitalism."" big problem young kids unvaxed. Among adults, vulnerable mostly gotten shot, take precautions. Kids can't get shot may support maturity careful stay masked. may even know vulnerable yet. 11k yesterday... 'CALIFORNIA COVID HORROR'?

California almost double population Florida: going article's metric suppose CA would need hit around 40K ""earn"" headline.... 29,312 new cases 119 deaths recorded

So, 30k new cases 29,312 new cases yesterday. risks think might present getting 3rd dose? is. hope works alright class body, choice. Get vaccinated work. \*shrug\* absolutely can. think massive corporations mandating employees get vaccinated making sure new hires vaccinated?

I'm sure got information from, entirely false.

Edit: what's illegal asking follow questions like ""why vaccinated?"". Employers absolutely allowed ask someone isn't. I’m kind tired hearing stories. exactly supposed protect children? we’ve already vaccinated? can’t keep inside forever. It’s scary feel like everyone survives going major anxiety end it. Whereas none seems affecting anti vaxxers all. Maybe I’m wrong. Maybe messaging encouraging people get vaccines? Okay? find every opinion imaginable every response. mention school closings. 

But shown disregard precautions utilized think bad kids die. That's dumb. Columbus area vet today dogs follow-up surgery. assumed staff would back masks again. one wearing mask, incredibly frustrating. include VP? even deserve subpar treatments. die hill stand on.  state's governor mandated cities cannot make masks mandatory... Also state/government funded facility (I.E. public schools, police departments, jails, hospitals, etc). :( Bc religious reasons sometimes think ""too dangerous"" ._.  cannot interpret this. I’ll 6mos post vax end Sept….then what? include guidance what’s next? Moderna 3rd booster vax? /r/byebyejob Covid hospital admissions aged 18-34, says NHS morning, 420 patients COVID. 55 ICU, 55 people fighting lives one patients 30s 40s sad someone die ICU without touch someone’s face seeing loved ones,” said Juana Mejia, COVID ICU nurse manager.

Doctors new meme, Younger, Sicker, Centers Disease Control Prevention (CDC) data, recent weeks shown increase COVID-19-related hospitalizations age groups, hospitalized adults ages 18–49 accounting largest increase. experience telling hold breath

Actually, might good idea. 2 1 natural vaccine? Exactly, feel like either get it, everyone operating different forms logic here. 

I get people need someone something blame, US nearly 50% vaccination rate, estimation nothing short miracle modern science times. delta variant originated India less 8% population vaccinated, never table eradicate disease completely, least crazy draconian measures like completely closing US borders world. always going endemic, Virus always going mutate globally species progressed enough fully eradicate virus like instantly. trouble understanding people understand frustrated we've completely eradicated yet. 

To like asking something impossible that's never done history mankind, odds actually start it, people getting pissed perfectly efficient. numerous people afraid opening school thread. they're testing positive week, going take weeks figure many die months long term effects.

Of course death long COVID risk everyone taking since needs seem outweigh needs many. 

Why restrictions anyone point? logic virus affects could applied public. almost 630,000 deaths, that's accounts 0.18% Americans. 112K cases day, that's 0.03% Americans, even fewer hospitalized. math called out, that's CDC calculated breakthrough cases, comparing case everyone fully vaccinated. God lead light. I’ve still seen idiots part world(US-Midwest) recently yesterday saying “kids proven spreaders get sick it”. still much isn’t known virus say take chance. types anti-vaxx say don’t know could long term, yet issue virus also idea long term especially young kids. disconnect mind boggling. Agreed, people interested nuanced scientific argument may need change behavior(s) according new data changes variant population. want hear done with. wear mask not? Inside out? Vaccine not? Black white answers acceptable answer, even devoid politicization. said, fucking pandemic dragging sick tired bullshit. sister also sister-in-law trying send kids back school without masks. gone far part actual protests masks. fucking ridiculous. Teachers set tone classrooms. “My class, wear mask.” It’s room much taxpayer. THIS. mRNA vaccines development years. new technology invented Covid. nothing cause late effect literally nothing lasts immune memory. Think mRNA post-it note cell. message acted on, note discarded. mRNA fragile degraded day two. vaccines handled carefully staying frozen, shaken, etc. Sydney bad. lockdown end. need expect kind numbers.

Im sure ama willing accept risk strain hospital systems. 

But leap faith.  long vaccinated people continue protect people chose right thing?  misinformation. fucking science. Science changes nature throws curveballs, data collected, etc. keep head swivel don't. Every week hits new record. larger dose moderna may primarily boost storage temperature compared smaller pfizer dose. combined 4 week dosing schedule might edge moderna ever slightly. studies i've seen, moderna consistently better pfizer %. I'm sure companies buy time. vaccine fully approved, adopt ""get vaccinated get out"" policy. believe deaths things matter? 


He belief corrected. We've never given humans mRNA vaccines before. phase 1 type trials gave volunteers boosters 6 months COVID vaccines. Safety profile similar second dose, number people large enough measure really rare side effects (allergies, inflammation, clotting). clotting issue definitely concern giving boosters under-50s we'd like data on, older people risk COVID simply far higher.

Moderna instance:  main concern long-haul covid associated cognitive decline, many cases could seeing future epidemic ADHD/learning disorders develop. Even we're talking 1% infections, epidemiologists saying half school-age kids 12 catch covid semester un-masked classrooms, we're talking huge swath may suffer learning disabilities. country we're prepared this.  I'm thinking wait 3rd party recommendations booster fear vaccine companies able see clearly dollars falling around them:

""Moderna said sold $5.9 billion worth coronavirus vaccine six-month period ending June 30th, total 302 million doses. company reported net income $2.8 billion **total revenue $4.4 billion three months ending June 30th, compared $67 million year-ago quarter**."" Asymptomatic infection doesn’t mean inflammation. need inflammation clear infection. means individual notice inflammation. 

You blood test someone find strong signs inflammation, like high white cell counts, person aware symptoms.  Mississippi 50th state hit 40% population one dose. extremely late I'm glad finally made it. disagree with? whole heartedly agree job hard. I'm well aware public health policy personal health policy easily diverge especially large part population resistant facts. agree, never said wasn’t fair. wasn’t complaining rollout Add post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

'We know slow spread': Columbus, Franklin County indoor mask advisory

Soaring COVID-19 cases, mostly due delta variant mutation, are worrying health officials. since urging wear masks precautions heeded all, beer forced issue indoor mask advisory Columbus Franklin County — a step short blanket mandate, prohibited under Ohio law.

""We know long pandemic last, know next variant serious be, but know slow spread,"" Dr. Mysheika Roberts, Columbus Public Health commissioner, said Thursday.

Universal masking already required many businesses, hospitals many schools, recently passed state law makes enforcement challenge.

Senate Bill 22, became law March after the legislature voted override veto Gov. Mike DeWine, allows lawmakers reject modify state health order soon given, let legislature extend end states emergencies. bill took effect June.

Roberts said law's effect city laws, likely would imposed indoor mask mandate.
The law also prevents blanket health mandates local boards health adopting sweeping restrictions everyone, closing schools prohibiting gatherings epidemic.

At news conference Thursday front Columbus Public Health's headquarters Downtown, doctors major local health systems excoriated believe vaccines used cases human tragedy illustrate why.

Joe Mazzola, Franklin County Public Health commissioner, said county's positivity rate climbed 1.3% 2.8% last month.
The seven-day moving average cases risen 56%. time, 50% county vaccinated. that's higher national average, still not enough, officials said.

""It mind-boggling,"" said Dr. Rustin Morse, chief medical officer Nationwide Children’s Hospital. ""You literally rolling dice choose vaccinated.""

The hospital seen unexplainable 25% increase respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), affects babies, taxing staff capacity, said. ""We full.""

""We seeing numbers August typically see December. know why.""

As coronavirus continues afflict younger healthier patients, worries surge spread Children's.

If changing directives mask wearing causing public whiplash aversion mask-up, officials illustrating growing health crisis real-world cases.

Dr. Veena Satyapriya, critical care physician at Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center told healthy 28-year-old man hiking vacation Nevada recently.

On drive home wife parents, began chills.

He eventually admitted hospital put ventilator.

""Even breathing tube measures, became critically ill"" sid Satyapriya.

The man currently critical, stable condtion, ECMO machine essentially replaces lungs heart functions. machine requires implantation surgery.

""What makes heart-breaking family vaccination status could prevented.""

At OhioHealth, ""We 80-year-old COVID-19, lot 40, 50 60-year-olds,"" said Dr. Amy Imm, OhioHealth vice president quality patient safety. ""None us know hit us mildly, moderately severely, that's need worry.""

The advisory may be a mandate order, Roberts said public moral responsibility follow regardless age. advisory ""will help us slow spread virus,"" said. Okay friend keeps putting (extreme fear needles point fainting). they've changed tune said get anything could kill given time matter. I'm almost positive can't talk going near needle.... Hopefully post ok Bit again, ask...does much matter? hospital capacity cannot treat another patient - whether staff equipment, change anything meaningful way? Vatican John Paul II future pope Cardinal Ratzinger put statement options exist, moral take vaccines used embryonic cells derived UK, appears…  support universal healthcare gets interesting. 

Many want saying benefit all, problem restricting access certain people. I'll test driving friend mine mechanic. Problem religions spring overnight. grifter would totally start religion vaccines idiots would join. love people heroes.

February, first symptom dry cough fatigue. got tested next day, got positive result night next morning taste entirely gone, smell almost entirely gone. two weeks, taste came back everything mean everything tasted terrible. lost 25 pounds period appetite food palatable. got chicken broth, raw vegetables Gatorade, handle anything else. Taste went back normal roughly two months, smell took little longer I'm sure fully back honest. know come decision past 18 days since made post, exact fears you. 

I've already myocarditis 10 years ago (due flu) even worried even higher risk due that. young, healthy male get heart inflammation vaccine, risk even higher? There's data that.

The things convinced get Pfizer shot 2 days ago:

\- Covid, risk heart inflammation 100 (!) times higher vaccine

\- know exactly get vaccined, plan ahead accordingly take easy shot (no workouts least week, try rest, maybe super worried afford it, take 1 2 days etc.). disease, might symptom-free first 3 4 days therefore unknowingly put strain yourself.

\- Covid systemic disease give myriad organ issues, heart inflammation (lung. testes. kidneys. etc). let's even talk Long Covid. Compared that, vaccine walk park

\- Delta variant finally convinced good. always planned getting vaccinated, like you, scared heart inflammation, wanted wait vaccine like Novavax thought could avoid infections masks hygiene (after all, worked past 1,5 years). read contagious chickenpox even severe variants, finally decided get shot 2 days ago.

Whenever thoughts side effects creeped inside me, told myself: ""Better catching Covid, better catching covid...."" ""With Covid, side effects much worse."" helped me.

Hope helps make decision.  Yes, one gets breakthrough case, high chance passing daughter, especially may realize infected.

So main takeway is, rely vaccines alone. They're great component layered protection, one can't accidentally forget.

But also try minimize time indoors strangers especially unvaccinated friends family. Mask need go stores, etc.

The vaccine huge benefit, especially families still pandemic going on. carefree summer 2019 again. kids data suggests less bad influenza. 

Have actually looked data kids?

I think original point relative risks still applies. 

My thought process deciding get vaccine included following.

Vaccine free. Hospital stay not.

Vaccine may cause severe allergic reaction would treated site epi pen. concerned that, think anyone died that.

There many hospitalized covid patients people severe vaccine reactions. vast majority leave hospital lung damage. think anyone knows permanent. need that.

That long enough list personally decide favor vaccine.

I think reported blood clots heart inflammation side effects, looked percentage prevalence turned hundreds times likely get hit lightning, course, worry about. 

Getting covid seemed like sort low probability high impact risk buy auto home owners insurance for. Delta came along risk getting went way up. 

Of course decision thought processes it. Different things important me. different risk tolerance.

I know anything someone could briefly explain it, that'd nice. end game avoid variant Spanish flu reboot. Sadly evolutionary much older war fighting here, ultimately behavior strength face adversity determine end game scenario.

To quote Tolkien discussing horrors Spanish flu ww1 lors rings: 

“I wish need happened time,” said Frodo.
“So I,” said Gandalf, “and live see times. decide. decide time given us.” chances virus gets new strain strong closes shit fall? Look, I've also reading data AAP kids mask out, let's also perspective here: 500 kids die annually RSV kind ignore that. 200ish die annually influenza even vaccines ignore that. 

I two kids. One going kindergarten week. She'll mask, 2 year old mask daycare. end let's real risks kids COVID are, else equal, pretty low.

I love kids much possible, impossible protect harm. get vaccinated I'll care even less.

The AAP data bunch data sets paint pretty low-risk picture compared tons endemic viruses risks really worry regular. 

Take heart, spouse vaccinated risks family extraordinarily low now. visit Netflix every day, start masking house? states tuition free virtual public schools. homeschool could option. response exact quotes document, I'll wait response that. regularly receive samples around country sequence order identify quantify specific variants. It’s process called variant surveillance. way legal illegal get third dose new gen vaccines year ? symptoms two you? favorites ones insisting summer 2019 shit. They’re sure.  True, said “admissions slowed” “hospitalizations reduced.” 

I’m fan DiSantis, seems like odd thing roast over. rate new admissions important metric keep eye on. It’s pretty gross see Paywall someone please help  that's true 500k+ extra deaths? Still flu? 95% symptomatic infection. seems asymptomatic infection, estimated 70 80% earlier variant. Studies shown prevention symptomatic COVID somewhere 70 80% Delta. people aren’t afraid getting sick aren’t afraid going broke… they’re afraid getting sick. 

An asymptomatic mild case Covid costs time work quarantine (and aren’t honest infection shouldn’t cost dime). that’s unvaccinated assume Covid would like them, whether already mild case, believe conspiracy theories virus’ severity exaggerated, they’re confident chances due young age perceived healthiness. Especially portion ward occupied people infected becoming sick enough come bothered mask. Thank you. hope it’s nothing serious Well I’m Canada job allowed 12 weeks leave I’m able work.

Edit add- trust could care home every day would!!!! Delta variant become highly prevalent many parts world, including United States

Every testing area around says differentiate whether positive tests delta variant not. CDC getting info say 93% cases delta variant?... way scientific information used sure is. Alright, we’ll I’m “symptomatic” fully vaccinated person tested positive week, symptoms sinus issues slight fatigue. wasn’t vaccinated I’m sure I’d far sicker, vaccine absolutely it’s job. [Not true get info? trying scare! probably nothing. forget...there still ton viruses bacteria could get sick. get test see. Feel better! Yea honestly think politicization COVID, people gone insane extremes sides. Like first spring 2020 thinking hell, wear mask it’s big deal. wearing mask day every day year, getting vaccinated, seeing actual data shows us young vaccinated healthy person pre-existing conditions (which INCLUDES obesity) absolutely real risk, I’m like long going forced protect people don’t want protection? 

I mean people truly insane point neurotic irrationally cautious are.

Canceled work events, get work, attend meetings, present, comfort bedroom. understand exceptions like losing loved ones, vaccine that's less concern people even complaining that, they're complaining can't go drinking every while. Like buy alcohol drink home? understand frustrating me. 9mo old ""daycare""??

I'm curious young infant cared home?

In Canada get 1 year paternal leave daycares accept infants (&lt;1yo). six months infected, half patients still struggled forgetfulness quarter experienced additional cognitive challenges. sick patient Covid-19 indicator whether would experience cognitive severity initial disease predict going get this,"" Erausquin told CNN. ""In fact, many minimal symptoms -- cold loss smell.""

Tracking hospitalization death important comes breakthrough infections, way take consideration establishing policy. much still unknown.

I'm fully vaccinated, personally I'm ""going back normal"" know ""normal"" involve lifelong debilitating health conditions. end, everyone make choice.  common misunderstanding. citing overall efficacy, *includes* stopping contraction. 
 
You need read data carefully. says: data shows protection mortality Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine even higher – around 69% – **for confirmed cases second dose** least 7 days prior positive test. 
 
This means vaccinated people *who manage get it*, suffer death 69% rate unvaccinated people. Alpha variant. add reduced chance contracting first place, that's get: **When combined estimated protection becoming case**, equivalent estimated 97% protection mortality individuals vaccinated 2 doses Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. 
 
 
A second study weeks later, second link, shows updated data Delta variant know makes vaccines less effective overall. 
 

 
More data shows [spreading second vaccination apart even 3 like Israel US causes much stronger antibody response. UK (and Canada) spread vaccination doses start, fair say trials going show stronger vaccine effectiveness least points US. 
And, data shows time antibodies vaccine wane, study 2 months ago, antibodies waned least since. 
And finally let's throw fact everyone vaccinated 2-doses Pfizer Moderna. 1/5 ""vaccinated"" Americans 1-dose, almost garbage Delta 33% effectiveness. J&amp;J also effective Delta mile. 
 
All compounding factors means US certainly 69% reduction severe disease. Probably around 55-60%. think stretch call ""~half"". 
 
This misinformation, data. one cared Alpha vaccine brought Rt &lt;1 even pre-pandemic behavior. Delta infectious showing ability spread among even fully vaccinated populations. vaccinated people worry *getting* virus, need know likely cause damage potentially hospitalize them. People need informed.  
 
 mean there's reason people talking getting third booster. tastes good. appears necessary order maintain pre-pandemic behavior stop spread. bet (hope) good number attendees vaccinated, although may say so. shouldn’t afraid anymore November 2019 matter equals what. keep em coming. better nothing. I'm happy every single person decides juice up. Better late never. Hey now. Alamo pretty dope. DeSatan moral compass, soul empathy. long gets paid remains control, nothing change.

The ""man"" threatened completely defund schools tell students need wear masks, God's sake! literally everything turn Florida Covid graveyard.

Only way Florida improve monster removed power, he's pressured change. ""Active Cases"" made stat worldmeter admission highly Active Cases = (total cases) - (total deaths) - [Recoveries = statistic highly imperfect, reporting missing, incomplete, incorrect, based different definitions, dated (or combination these) many governments, local national level, sometimes differences states within country counties within Thanks! Kudos mom part regardless politics (accordion solo) Wife positive Moderna too.  know. doctor (I'm not), I'd like think I'd give individual. Must hard place be. one said wrong begin with.  
If sure come can't explain anything? 
What said controversial immunological standpoint. people like get panties bunch talking disease current pandemic. sooner world vaccinated, sooner variants lose reservoir mutate. It’s everyone’s best interests ensure single vaccine dose expires unused, vaccinated not. Oh Alabama! good math since 28% closer one four one three. That’s help. unless medical reason vaccinated, chance it? Canada double vaxxed certain populations highest priority first. Seniors certain age, remote First Nation communities lack hospital capacity, long term care homes, prioritized first doses rest population given supply limits. Wife Moderna currently positive. YMMV. i'm you, sad read that. covid changed lives best remain humans. state governor legislature ~~are trying kill you~~ don’t care die political points.

Fixed slightly. accurate, still horrible. Funny considering wife tested positive COVID fully vaccinated. fancy getting rude awakening covid, say let them. vaccine protects me, vaccine protects you. I'm interested 'protecting others' decline vaccine themselves. Yeah think people don’t understand lot “camping” areas overcrowded drunkfests. Stay safe. lots things like hikes camping backyard kids enjoy so. Trust 5 kids hanging hammocks backyard making s’mores thrilled much going campsite. smallpox - opportunity eradicate covid first 10 weeks 2020. people able actually shut isolate maybe would chance. think ship sailed back then. 

“fuck ppl didn’t get shot” Sure - people board still puts us enough danger warrant measures. vaccines good aren’t magic. Also, people haven’t gotten shot children eligible. Half-assed measures still result millions vaccinated less chance get breakthrough infection. idiot everyone knows seasons last 2-ish years straight! go school?!?! 

/s good doctor today. care patient way deserves.

How could absolutely you??? Baby Boomers know vaccinated. took seriously. other, younger generations said ""I can't stay inside summer, need go bars clubs concerts parties!""

Also, one ""Boomer"" (you make word almost sound like slur) could done something, didn't. elected people age either. generation think Fauci/Biden from? 

Sad knee jerk reaction blame entire generation, reddit conditioned so. variants impacted vaccine claiming solution convince everyone get vaccinated.

it’s 1.5 years conflicting lies every angle. Arguably flu cold season long time ago. Think it, could eliminate flu people kept bringing flu deaths last year, maybe fight too. DeSantis literally mayor Jaws. worse. stop afraid anytime want. need wait daddy government tell ok. appreciate it, Biden told everyone take masks go party even though knew half country fully vaccinated entire population children vaccinated. sent' clear message okay kids around idiots protecting spreading kids.

The message beginning social distancing masking reached real critical mass vaccinations, fake number guys put (and meet) ignored acted like everything fine.

Yes, I'm mad idiots like Florida governor too, I'm pretty tired Fauci point too. Mask. Mask. Mask. Mask. dancing around lab stuff, constantly changing numbers herd immunity. Instead pulling stuff behind level people say ""i know,"" recommend conservative approach, goes better speculative BS proven wrong. methodology ""active cases"" (total cases) - (total deaths) - (recovered), disclaimer site recovered Recoveries = statistic highly imperfect, reporting missing, incomplete, incorrect, based different definitions, dated (or combination these) many governments, local national level, sometimes differences states within country counties within state. 

So yeah, ""active cases"" stat made worldmeter admission highly inaccurate. Can't contribute economy hospital. vaccine likely better. someone arrives unvaccinated could still potentially get spread around. Requiring vaccinated makes getting spreading much less likely. crude.. assume Pfizer 95% extrapolate, AZ would 83%, Janssen 61.5%, AZ/Pfizer 99.3%. sister picking home test CVS shall see antibody

Governor DeSantis way behind news/science. Many monoclonal antibody longer work due variants resistant. people need Regeneron cocktail first ten helpful (and hopeful!). Thank you! Got it, thanks clarification. Texas FL running neck neck stupidity death anyway 9 deaths there. 9. good fuck government telling us? virologists warn get ignored. NY’s generously defined metro area around 21m people 100 vs 60 seems match population nicely. world yet first. People clamoring third, EXCEPT trials see whether third beneficial, height afraid selfish. Particularly case absolutely medical impetus get it- doctor going ""maybe should"" autoimmune condition, guy scared fearmongering internet. (rich) (North) America. even know third dose protective effective. 

Hope stories like get folks think twice sharing articles ""waning efficacy"" ""inevitable"" third dose/boosters, though. Many even scientific entity listed, news media purporting due science never 100% prepare get vaccinated weekly attention grabbing headline conclusions. stuff clearly influences people- influences engage anxiety self-centredness anything. Sort of. I’m interested endgame period. 

We think vaccines effective enough create herd immunity disappear community. 

I wondering catching COVID number times, instead - addition - vaccine, might give stronger protection vaccine alone. hence potentially get us herd immunity. 

It seems like that’s unlikely though, many us watching immunity boosters indefinitely future. I'm teacher think 7 year old would fine. public schooling started late 1800s, kids mass schooling thing. groups 20-30 kids day long essential facet human development. benefits, would incorrect state child 7 would necessarily set back academically simply classroom. Many children thrive classroom setting.  Ya got yer freedoms, right!!

/s moderna woke sorts respiratory symptoms 2 weeks ago. Got tested negative covid. However Dr. said another RSV type virus hitting lot people right now.  ended taking 10 days started feeling better. Yeah sorry buddy ridiculous claim based linked. 

That study 50 hospitalized covid patients controls. absolutely cannot make claim children (hospitalized not) get covid get permanent vascular damage based that.

Additionally, describe elevated biomarker, clinical evidence vascular damage. article maintains many children completely asymptomatic.

You also claim damage may may happened permanent, also supported article. Ugh feel ya...  Interesting, thanks. took 184 years. paying attention Texas? Abbott plays politics everything, including children teachers. around someone vulnerable flu young old asking much wear mask go out.  Cloth masks offer trivial protection wearer. *If you’re vaccinated* risk serious illness death covid flu flu seasons. Actually 15x less risk compare numbers covid breakthrough cases resulting hospitalization death 2018-2019 flu season. certainly intend live rest life intermittently wearing mask. Absurdity. If, DeSantis says, Covid crisis, hospitals send un-vaccinated home. good doctor always care trying. fault things happening. best that's anyone could ever ask you. Please try gentle yourself.  Took way long this. need get rid blanket bans (e.g. Europe) swap risk-based approach. people dying hospitals right overwhelming vaccinated. hard understand helpful vaccines are? flu variants also able predicted used figure efficient vaccine. Hence get one flu vaccine per year.

At pace people getting vaccinations every month. It’s sustainable. get vaccine new variants, another newer, dominant variant vaccines ineffective against. Needing trials top ensure safety? takes months.

The variants coming quicker vaccines ever. point reasonable approach lockdown Biden Fauci already stated won’t it. Covid antivaxxers anti covid vaccine vaccines now? I’m lost this. Unbelievably childish. would make war hurricane? precedent set, business arbitrarily demand show proof flu vaccine. 

So baseless speculation private businesses may choose do, hypothetical vaccine mandate created future? particularly concrete point. Regardless, business within rights refuse service grounds. concern covid vaccine pass going expand areas can't enter business unless XYZ checked off. system tempting large list arbitrary things considered ""dangerous"" exclude people like participating society.

Are vaccinated? think scores political points people power, politicians, large business owners... end money sufficient capital think feel stay amass power. needs serious prison time behind falsifying vax documents discourage Gates one Florida projected even past numbers. great! hope theres extra studies confirm info really good news. know strains involved? would good know delta specifically turns since turned understanding virus upside many ways. think it’s dumbest thing ever. I'd look like total effing moron, Republican look really... really hope kids come without problems. don’t control ability decide safety virus. No, like said, testing. everything asked, Cigna still screwing us around. glad hear youre alright Fuck that. Vaccines widely available want them. Vaccines still offer superb protection serious illness death. It’s responsibility protect people won’t protect themselves. certainly avoid wearing mask whenever possible. certainly support kind mask mandate unless vaccines longer effective similar risk last year. That's fair, too.

Let's forget tho, despite fact numbers ""are decreasing"" - places North America single-digit numbers 0's days.  maybe around, certainly dominant. Thank much this, help. Yes, getting past anxiety worst. Maybe I’ve put there, hold accountable. honestly believe everyone hasn’t vaccinated die Covid? politicians created crisis held account? ballot box seems lenient willful ignorance, incompetence craven political decisions. jailed.  first glimpse anonymous, worldwide forums would like. get wrong, active usenet reddit, really dark scary places, like today. kids school due track scheduling. Masks worn class problem cafeteria! beyond would cram bunch unvaccinated kids cafeteria, open food everywhere,saliva dribbling, drinks spilling, shouting laughing, behaviors kids exhibit table. California. public schools ran fucking idiots. don't, anymore. extra couple percentage points towards catching anything unvaccinated. (It's also start smoke season. I'd masking time year anyways.) understand children maybe less affected, sometimes governments officials people look like think virus like, *oh it’s kid let’s infect kid* Thank you. really hope decide get vaccinated. Stay healthy stay safe ❤️ Nah. went testing. Turned it. Knowing probably saved in-laws Christmas.

They’re still fighting us paying tests - despite calling ahead, meeting requirements!  people get. Numbers severely skewed children many sheltered. Combine everyone going back school virulent virus, recipe disaster unvaccinated kids going back school. flu didn’t even get eradicated Covid restrictions. It’s going come back go back normal. would intentionally try repeat this. This. I'm fairly confident COVID. I've fair number weird health issues past year overlap ""long COVID"" symptoms like joint inflammation, brain fog, headaches, fatigue, trouble sleeping. Physical manifestations anxiety stress run family, unfortunately, fairly confident that's causing symptoms. see long haulers news talking similar symptoms mysteriously ebb flow, find thinking that's likely culprit well. 

Not meant downplay say good study would compare control population tested positive COVID population tested positive look population self-reports experiencing typical ""long-haul symptoms"" regular basis last year. governor walk park, zero political experience, I'd like think could counted fuck state's COVID response \*\*that\*\* badly. may true, absolutely permanent vascular damage occurring *all* children get COVID, regardless likely see comes damage years, absolutely occurring. current variant impacted vaccine. think flu vaccine changes every year? Different strains. think lot people understand goal vaccine turn covid infection mild cold like that.  Sure always evolve less deadly, virus evolves deadly, contagious, burns simple manner speaking. already delta incredibly contagious, anything contagious &amp; also deadly able compete strains kill hosts quickly. Says guy worst COVID numbers country, possibly world. commenters opposite experience. need data sure. Gotchaaa, that's comforting least. Let's hope stays way. Thanks explanation! What's endgame China? going run country forever? virus going eliminated rest world time soon. going shut rest world?

Terrible job getting vaccinated

The anti-vaccination idiots still biggest hurdle country Hold on, let’s jump conclusions:) said true, earned trust it. Everyone tired. Stop catering sellfish stupid.

( sellfish stupid =People eligible without medical problem medical reason can't take vaccine...... ...you know mean! ) silver lining it’s COVID likely advanced medical research ten twenty years collaboration, government support, private funding, acceptance new ideas, inspiration young problem solving scientists. No, obviously sufficient. paper admits model use control pre-existing intelligence 0.55 R squared value.

It’s never sufficient control like unknown unknowns. never sure there’s confounder you’re missing. That’s randomized controlled trials gold standard.

It doesn’t matter “lucky” data like that, it’s reality.  Rental Assistance monies? know money allocated little actually given out... still there.

--and apologize advance clueless what's actually happening ground level.  know pissed way now. want learn correct this. Unfortunately, conservatives unable understand something unless directly affects worst way. unless kid goes hospital dies, change mind. might view reinforced kids get mild case, “see, it’s worse flu”. large enough percentage kids get severely sick die affect electoral chances, care directly effects them. almost taking seriously is...bad. problem CDC goals plans dealing COVID long-term little horribly conveyed public. 

The CDC reports science, politicians make goals plans. Really annoying articles like link actual study. would young healthy person who's already zero risk dying hospitalized get I'm aware, I'd rather safe sorry. I'd happy turns I'm overreacting. right. doctors start deciding *worthy* medical treatment, slippery slope. Looking Texas Florida, think message aged rather badly. Still, many states bringing back mandates.  Ya'll crazy lmaoo. afraid getting sick. American thing? I've never met somebody Netherlands scared getting sick, this. Getting sick part life. life.

Perfect us Reddit introverts. Love Try Khan Academy. free think start first grade level subjects like math reading. Yeah I’d also like clarification percentages, go actual numbers. Mutations random happen constantly, ones help virus spread survive us actually observe. COVID viruses probably mutate spike longer viable infection thousands (millions?) times day. Since they're viable infection, lines replicate immediately die they're never observed.

Since vaccines (at least ones used US) target spike scientists believe variant spike different enough infect humans would still similar enough recognized immune response, we're pretty sure variant total immune escape. really understand posts US folks arms masks again.

As answers go, encouraging. right, updated comment clarify. Thanks. Damn, didn’t realize Dad Governor Maine think small vindictive person wants gatekeep gaslight people decisions absolutely impact action (or inaction) national governments issue exporting vaccines.

It’s possible loss smell correlated severe disease turn cognitive decline, directly related cognitive decline. qualified US citizens please. Enough nonsense. I'm probably talking Russian bot I'm 26 great health, probability severe COVID outcome already zero. What's alternative?

Also, require citizens vaccinated. Kids barely even get sick though, all. well known point. it’s complete yet near future. Probably hospitalizations stay way long time. YOLO baby.  Gonna drive pick truck 120mph 2 year old front seat seat belt wife riding dirty bed. assume vaccine widely available. me, ppl compliant supportive mask wearing got vaccine. Afterwards resisted it.

Terrifying Huh? Everyone voluntarily implement mandates safest them, families, businesses.

Says Governor Abbott.  I'm sure knows ""mandate"" is. parents watching kids Im homeschooling one hour every night plus 13 weekend. states asynchronous virtual schools. playdates outdoors socialization evenings. whats changed much? kid parents left home time full time jobs. think would loved school home. I'm anesthesiologist, so. I'm right 🤷‍♂️ Never said master plan, public health (and many already field do) back permanent restrictions, especially masks. Add little media pressure top boom, normal dead buried - nothing like master plan two groups enjoy influence boost got COVID far much willingly give anytime soon. High school student Wave enumeration rather controversial topic. I'm entirely sure even uniform standard delineating one wave ends another begins. many cases retrospective. Easy. Ask airlines jointly run vaccine-mask-test exempt flights, attendants unvaccinated, board unvaccinated, mask free passengers. **lot** old people okay. hope sees bro. see agree concern also aware midst pandemic unprecedented proportions. I’m saying doctors permanently step away taking break moving another area service recover makes great deal sense. 

I would imagine constantly treating people took effort protect would incredibly emotionally trying. would also imagine results higher level attrition before.  Proof?

I ask seems want story heard. I'd like able share story among people think need hear it. plausible sounds, dislike propagating unverified stuff like this. Health insurers want cover healthy people. want collect premiums, pay claims. drop people cancer diseases. That's US healthcare system screwed up. get chest. year since Corona. However, distorted smell some. cant STAND smell armpits better yet privates!!!! smells rank! I'm paranoid people smelling it, far complaints, live ranky ass smell!! Feeling better? I'm father 7 year old fine. cried almost every day. 70% American adults vaccinated, it’s certain *third* that’s dragging everyone else down.

We really need full FDA approval mandate dig mess. Yup, I've got family friends close walking. One mentioned burn out, fact patients nasty assholes medical staff. busting asses putting lives line bunch selfish fucks can't bothered wear mask get vaccines least, treat human beings modicum respect.   factually inaccurate. kids, gay adult men. It’s definitely pretty bad currently. Cases high right, perhaps importantly, testing really low. testing like half much last winter. means things much worse look. point becomes rounding error though. think CDC's revised guidance finally loosened? I'm sure keeping place long run sustainable, since result COVID becoming endemic it'll likely mean annual flare-ups like seasonal illnesses. permanent winter mask mandates seriously going thing? nice Harleys sell afterwards. 🙄 check nursing sub 

travel nurses getting offered 10k+/month go covid ICUs turning saying, odds going hospital, dying, (not sure referring to) - Whatever measuring, chances stastistically insignificant. Essentially 100% happen you. Thank you, kind stranger!  Maine greatest state Union

Then explain voted guys pissing onto hands? lol I’ll wash hands clean bathroom, dirty one. faucets soap dispensers public restrooms usually disgusting. body much cleaner average public restroom sink. crazy? Plus lack mask usage. Like adding high winds wildfire. Could save 1000 lives state mask policies reinstated. attitude allows opioid epidemic keep growing &amp; growing. People selfish, make shitty choices, take care health, none matters. Health care right everyone.  Florida become joke vaccine passport proposed city Los Angeles, whereas mask mandate enforced county. allowance made. People travel way much already, lifestyle even close sustainable.

I'll pass. Oh gosh! husband! got sick contrast dye ahead appendix surgery, got Moderna (both shots) March. didn’t issues save sore arm. got this!! Dude, ran masks administration time wouldn’t force profit conscious business owners make some. Thanks clarifying; trouble keeping B cells straight. Also, Java developer, appreciate comparison. Thanks linking study. makes feel slightly better. many thousands cases cause last   simple things save lives health: quit smoking, eat salad while, get 30 minutes exercise 3 times per week, etc.

Yeah, none things simple. guess occasional salad pretty simple. compared getting quick free shot next time roll HEB, wearing mask? things much harder. much give. Idk OPs state states version apparently waitlisted since May Vaccine doesn’t brain. mutates. idea vaccine we’re using That's pretty big actually! hand, you, doctor, can't catch COPD obesity die took care someone it. Mutations weaken virus, manner speaking. virus started strong--it killed hosts. Killing hosts spread virus far wide interest virus. mutates weakens, becomes infectious less deadly. enough--too many masks, social distancing, proper hygiene force another mutation--way easier spread way less deadly. Viruses exist replicate. behavior maximize potential weaned variants. Well said. Boomer become slur label. easier demonize group people handy reductionist term. 

Many Boomers vote last president, voted legalizing pot, marched protest BLM want LGBT+ rights *'boomers'* responsible mess.

Let's leave prejudice hatred aside future look help other. Nary mask sight. US, please, stop watching news. shit fearmongering gets people like watching. C'mon Florida, disgusting. already do. Insurance accepted screens unworthy. nonprofit hospitals take what’s left.

And get Covid wacko denying Covid can’t breath getting violent measly strength still left, Urm… Police. Getting tired ""one dose"" metric. Reporting 20% people go back even month fully vaxxed. Full vaxx count. contagious less lethal? virus gettin weaker? know, I've seen posts screenshots places showing people saying stuff like that, orvtheir Dr. Told vaccine safe. feel like majority people liars, asked doctors leading questions, cherry picked responses. Otherwise, always ask doctor is, know go to... vaccinated people Ah, hurt read. good doctor, tell care quality good doctor. None clusterfuck fault best absolutely terrible circumstances. infecting people can't vaccinated, immunocompromised small percentage breakthrough cases. panic attack really scary. strong woman broke her. supposed protect kids costs, faced throwing wolves. know, except people catching Lack faith. gotten it, plan it. even protect new strain every week. beyond weird gotten much hype push. that's me. hospitals fail patients families it’s unacceptable. it’s doctors nurses hands save patient CEO sits IVORY tower! Worked administration know works! That’s math works. can’t use entire vaccinated denominator determine vaccine efficacy 

Recent study UK put vaccine efficacy 50% based real world data Delta get you’re saying conditional probability testing Covid-positive vs overall probability. However, 69% figure odds data sources can’t find comes from. Perhaps low it’s age-adjusted. Back UK, old people completed 2 doses.

This data past 28 days Singapore (Pfizer/Moderna essentially Delta). There’s lot vaccine breakthrough. vaccinated Covid cases (i.e. conditional probability looking for), 0.8% needed oxygen worse, compared 7.1% unvaccinated cases. That’s 89% protection severe disease even testing Israel Singapore good test aggressively positive tests reported. countries, mild/asymptomatic vaccinated people simply bother getting tested, skewing data towards severe vaccine breakthroughs. Singapore you’re close contact positive case, government forces quarantine testing even you’re vaccinated. friend lives San Antonio. got message Emergency Alert System saying hospitals essentially full. 9 10 patients unvaccinated. Follow cdc guidelines masks get vaccinated. 

I've never years Texas EVER gotten message system amber alert. Come double dose vaccine quarantine. Seems pretty easy 2/3 doses.

1/3 one two doses

28% two doses EU caught US cases passed US deaths lot. ughhhh. people stupid live. It’s Covidactnow.org would decision called question? Isn’t less spread better spread rapid?  Lmao, I’m calling control group I’m saying need control group. You’re simply understanding I’m saying. 

The positivity rate currently applied invalidated doesn’t use random sample it’s using closed set. number mean anything need sample across wider overall group closed subset fixed number samples per day. elect need control group number people subjected closed demographic forced testing/frontline workers get comparison sample. That's horrifying. know vaccine gotten? Part advantage mRNA vaccines target spike, one part really can't change much - mutates, narrow range mutations leave still functional.

In contrast post infection immunity diluted targeting wider variety aspects many functionally definitive. variant easily avoid lot non-strategic post infection response, can't much slightly evade extremely strategic response spike mRNA vaccines narrowly provoke.

I guess we'll leave analogies... Agreed. seriously unsettling feeling. two kids (both 12) supposed start school next Wednesday Texas. makes sick stomach. eeeek. Maybe refers \*your\* parents, hardly representative Canadian covid experience, speaking Canadian. I'm entirely sure going anecdotal it'd probably good clarify reader.

Then there’s ones like ours. Lord knows cards unbelievably easy fake. 700+ UNC. small number individuals. anti-vax nutters see viable path forward use without second thought.

Sounds like good parent. Thanks this! Mississippian fully vaccinated. 

My 12 year old boy walked Kroger got vaccinated 20 minutes. 

We plenty vaccines. ""Spread-necks"" running around getting everyone sick think Covid fake. ""Unvaccinated citizens choose leave country must return vaccinated???"" I'm you. hate take beds do, though. away trauma patients medical emergencies. line, think we'll start see breakthrough cases (statically low, realize) serious. contending right now. want beds open them. 

I believe MS, though could mistaken, put SOS additional help. Yeah. No. going many states afford give staff battles home. good doctor today.

Hell no, get say yourself. *under-resourced* doctor. doctoring ability sounds like plumbing depth creativity ingenuity job. times medical equivalent Köln concert. Köln concert day day. strong. puzzling even provide usual context before, compares elsewhere, cases per 100k, on.

I think biggest problem country (and world) page regarding strategy virus, every speaker, expert, journalist, etc., present different take what's good bad, what's important. tend think breakthrough cases probably important keep eye on, expense urgent things (and vacuum).

But pandemic screwed every way possible, change now?

Hopefully lead lifted travel restrictions Obviously  cool colors, tye dye camo now. Live East Texas friends San Antonio. got Emergency Alert Message phones today. Saying hospitals almost full. 9 10 people hospitalized havent vaccinated. Urged people follow cdc guidelines masks get vaccinated. Crazy stuff. 

I've lived Texas whole life basically never gotten message system except Amber alert. could tell vaccination staff you’re uninsured parents record you’re still insurance. Mandate it, Biden. delaying. risk reduction. one activity eliminates covid. everyone taking steps reduce transmission deadly virus. You’ll easier time getting LAPD would LASD.  Lmfao cmon rare. 4-5 200 million infections?

Mutations weaken virus (but make transmissible recall), mutations also make worse.

Nothing messed up. Yes dad allergy got two pzier shots great I’m plan, good luck getting LAPD come every call enforce this. Enforcement difficult. K12.com resources almost every state. surprised find Illinois almost homeschool requirements all. list subjects teach it. forms, permission, regulation, nothing.

Those want die die, don’t already currently strongly protected vaccines they’ve received months ago. 

I’m encouraging people first group consider getting vaccine, interest punishing people second group life-choices deathwish!  think corporate mandatory part cash incentive all. Believe raised 75 150 recently someone fact check that’s wrong.  Live san antonio, confirm. strange. Last one got peak covid waves before. Exactly cases entirely USA? Certainly, I've reading one briefings... One best sources information. significant distinctions USA UK start delta... Notably lower vaccination elderly, increase deaths relative cases massively. Also, demos nothing delta onset. young people unvaccinated, practically old people vaccinated. That's mostly true USA, lot less stark. Also, az used lot Pfizer, worse transmissibility, UK far partial immunity due first shot strategy, much delta spread, probably helped hospitalizations. Blame adults. requirement admission. case vaccinated people know it. UK catches lot asymptomatic cases due testing methodology asymptomatic breakthrough cases causing strokes issues, would know now. ICU wards shut due low staffing. anything like that??? really want it! Sorry butthurt said something completely true country. Whole Food Plant-Based I'm developing country, vaccinated yet. life worth less randomly born here? understand may concerned boosters I'd understand that. lack empathy concerning. good person

To quote similarly dispositioned Governor New Jersey, ""Look mirror.""

Come back thread couple days detached discussion reread comments.   official opinion marijuana grower?

You problem making confident, broad, guaranteed, claims incomplete, misunderstood information seemingly medical background.

I doctor. 

I admit possible correct. Anything possible incomplete information. much, much likely wrong, data supporting things saying. cannot even comprehend data trying use make arguments. even seem know analyze studies linking. guarantee authors study would disagreeing message board.  experts good enough?

This information useful trying make it, given amount time covid existed; we're still talking people already decline, young people suddenly terrible Alzheimers Covid.

Additionally, article goes way state know takes go away not, ever bothered read lol   use proper car seat exceeds local laws, politicians doctors. 

I take children swim lessons ensure familiarity water. 

We mask avoid crowds. never fan crowds anyways. 

Educational setbacks? child excelled cyber. Fucking crushed it. pass fake concerns. Seriously. stop. convince unmask CDC slowly pushing masking science.  mind mask, kids mind mask, wife mind mask. 

I wear underwear pants even though comfortable. Let wear want. Let family live life fuckin way.

The government dropping every ball possible, passes, exercise extreme caution. all, can't replace dead.

You go pokemon covid strains. I'm gonna avoid em like plague are.   There's huge difference people health mental issues, advice lands deaf ears they're vulnerable unable help themselves, fucking assholes, getting people disabled killed, refuse cooperate society keep us safe. There's huge fucking difference. sorry going this. Again. Know lots us nothing utmost respect wish could something get control. Louisiana Dem governor years even re-elected him.
He’s also taken pandemic seriously start. think Mythbusters episode toothbrush flushing. 

If that's happening, splashback well right?    Isreal also large anti-vaccine population. Huuuuggggeeee!!! quite say unstoppable definitely lot denial longer thought going thread. Remember this?

Man, think cool shit could dealing end time. We're future, possibilities endless. nooooooo, gotta act like mid black plague science witchcraft.  Whoever downvoted needs go take lap. True. specifically remember seeing Washington Michigan, states Democratic govs. guess Mississippi gonna Mississippi. what? Covid's going away. strategy worked beginning pandemic, crazy go back lockdown whenever cases pop up. coming person who's super careful. [meta] point time, every front page post flaired `USA`. Assume de facto US covid sub? 2% two months. long taking account acute viral infection.  know percentage symptomatic infections? republican curse. Lack empathy. care directly affects them. Thank work please stay safe.  rest world won’t get vaccinated, taking booster shots long time bunch folks want vaccine ""because know what's it"" heading tattoo parlors get questionable composition permanently deposited skin. Sounds right. Personally, wouldn’t take little kid now. Nope. would worried getting sick needing hospitalization hospital room and/or allowing parent stay covid. I’m really risk averse stuff like this. achieve Australia cannot containing Delta variant  Prioritise vaccinated can't get vaccinated clinical reasons enough beds least. 

Give others another reason vaccinate. definitely agree. whole thing bought real bafoons shadows Good point. wonder wasn’t weakest link chain last time.   Wouldnt upset would see second class citizens they're antivax though?  Segregation good enough rich white politicians, too. trick claim equality actually equal anything. younger population less likely die make delta less deadly. 60 yo obese man worse chance delta 60 yo obese man alpha, deadlier. mean, worked pretty well UK comes saving lives.

I would guess way improve UK would get everyone 40+ ""at risk"" done first, randomise everyone 40. issue one friend group would protected - barriers infection spread young people. Thank turn free vaccine make non-fat, non-alcoholic, non-addicted smoking, etc?

If not, no. guys stay. Originally vaccinated folks couldn’t spread it, CDC realized needed carrot get people get shots. Things changed now, obvs. *Natural selection enters chat* ..

This comment hilarious  analyzed deidentified patient records around world

Does mean identifiable patient records somewhere, ready sharing? I’m honestly shocked point anyone saying it’s still hoax. special kind willfully ignorant still feel sort government/world scam. rule college 7 years ago. fully vaccinated campus. Can't students population around world passing shit around   Oh irony statement coming lol There's new variant identified Angola? When? People done things masks.  Ok read sentiment rural hospitals really going hurting lose unvaxed staff. lot people rural areas, especially women, nursing job love science health, job rural area pays decently benefits. agree sentiment anti vax nurses licenses pulled, reality complicated.  Well, CDC estimates *up to* 62,000 people die flu year. That's less 624,000, right? can't imagine 600,000+ people die flu every year? hear that??   Oh generation struggled Scarlet Fever either made didn't?? society, much higher life expectancy (pre-covid) ""grandparents"" era.... lot Europe similar things. verify definitely big part it. big question going children 12, can't get vaccinated yet. way gets implemented without long drawn legal fight too. imagine gonna eventually morph basically - businesses make vaccination mandatory criteria service - much like allowed deny dresscodes, etc. 150+ strains. I'm pretty sure get shitty name confirm special, get bumped real name. Delta Plus starts slaughtering masses, they'll come something better.   We’re wfh masks required. Bars, gyms, indoor dining, concerts can’t attended masks. They’re effectively thing. lot longer that. qbout 5 weeks infection death, coroner's official declaration, released stats.

On top that, actually lit longer becUae beginning wave younger people catching takes make old people that. LA’s mayor actually little power. city council far say goes on. matter, county level important city far public health decisions concerned. sad! absolutely love he’s lawn really bring awareness this. Especially suffering loss himself. great way save lives sincerely hope he’s able influence community  technically Elizabeth's take away?  religious exemption, mandated registration state system. I'm PA Florida went school NC, tell great certainty NC state vaccination database quite robust can't faked. really need national database, revision means ""religiously exempted"". pretty good friend I've since intentionally distanted atheist claiming religious exemption avoid vaccine. room bullshit life. 8 year old due start person school week. virtual last year choice. Here's thing, can't force take kid school. DHS going come knocking door send kid school pandemic. Make whatever educated choice feel best kids.  


That said, worry masks, crap fabric masks fitting face helpful preventing wearer mask CDC would want believe, much better preventing wearer spreading it. ages 6-8, kids keeping masks anyway. 


We enrolled person school i'm really struggling decision I'm pretty sure right thing virtual weeks peaks I'm still struggling making decision. 


If anyone could point good resource age demographic hospitalizations either delta specific time specific could look data past couple months would helpful me.  could really crippling whole generation. Kids forced go school person deal effects knows long. idiots still going parties thinking trying containing virus.  But…limp bizkit there. Maybe DeSantis send heartfelt thoughts prayers victims?  MS - nope it’s like pandemic over. School starts tomorrow, maybe 30-40% wear masks crowded stores personally know handful vaccinated people. think vaccine doesn’t work, afraid side affects, think COVID isn’t bad think chipped (I wish kidding). 

Covid came office earlier year half got (I spared). one hospitalized. One coworkers didn’t get tested positive today. mask mandate lockdown?  Clearly, /s lost you. May recommend one following?

* r/Woooosh
* r/Woosh
* r/Whoosh can't force average person get vaccinated

You can, have, mandated vaccines criminal penalties (fines) violations times crisis. quite holding people forcing them, next best thing.

This new life understand people think immutable right get vaccinated harms others. mandate *currently*, right have. privilege revoked necessary. 

You lose right bodily autonomy harms people.

(and buy slippery slope argument always hear, 1) already set precedent *and one even seems know it* 2) slippery slope automatically apply everything. set precedent strict conditions vaccine mandate *only* apply then. That's slippery slope)

We legally draft kids go war fight country can't force people get vaccinated save lives citizens? 

Nah.  restraunts, bars, in-store grocery shopping, theme parks, concerts, plane rail travel. think need make painful possible **quickly** get **very meaningful** employees pay **cost** tests.  Great! Two Americans flew Canada. submitted fake vaccination cards prior leaving US.

It seems like Canada allowed fly could get soil give $19,000 fine send home. Also true. Both!  right blow single flu season water.

I wrong. 

Covid deaths would much higher without mask mandates/distance learning/etc. External limitations speak internal intrinsic qualities. Thank work do. beer alaska ever make way. don’t know. I’ll bet Governor’s weird things like forbidding counties respond covid see appropriate, ignoring it, humanities degrees plus law degrees. rot comes top, it’s theoretically well-educated usually.  surprised. Sick patients willing try it. know, I've spoken left clinic referral hand, drove directly Tampa General get treatment. Got call one day, thanking us saving life. felt better 3 days later. brother laws- brother, already decline, caught COVID even worse. makes total sense. Vulnerable populations risk! realize US bought additional 200M doses right? perhaps instead getting upset citizens US utilizing doses government purchased them, energy would better suited direct emotion could actually something it. It’s absolutely insane shouldn’t use instead let expire making trash. pissed people aren’t utilizing incredible gift, us deeply appreciative. REACT focusing labs outside SARS-CoV-2 screening. would great see inflammation markers &lt;18 year olds. 

I read anything says one way post-vaccine. Happy read anything found. However well documented occur pre-vaccine vaccines may may reduce risk.  


Maybe try get Covid?  exposed. 

Breakthrough rates like 25 percent per uk data, cdcs admission transmissibility third. Oh....trust results take six hours scheduler finished schedule next three months.

Almost like finish cpr health privacy education. quite possible You’re right, ideal number 0 8000. don’t argument contrary. imagine it’s even lower (higher?) though. many kids covid went untested. feel like people weigh out. immune compromised child/overweight/at risk probably wouldn’t send school. Otherwise though? way keeping away another year better  jet fuel can't melt steel beams, shadows moon landing footage taken place moon, MMR vaccines cause autism, etc. years another conspiracy pop everyone moved ICU beds Arkansas aren’t hospitals you’d want case trauma, heart attack, stroke major health issue. beds small hospitals without much specialized care. never heard calculus humanities. That’s pretty amazing. Oh God, fucking hate world live in. solution, we're still fucking up. idea even relevant point. luckily group friends don’t judge based vaccination status. abs aren’t. Every single one us covid lol. We’re 20’s 30’s. masks pretty bad communication health communication specialist. higher percentage vaccinate, case, especially elderly vaccinations approach 100%. 

The better state doing, higher percentage vaccinated deaths be.

The number per cases lower. detailed figures country bothered test, go Dude, worry EVERY potential long term consequence virus. even around 2 years yet. knows effects might 5, 10, 20 years line? Cool let turn whatabouburger followed ishouldhavegottenburger.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* 58% symptomatic right actually pretty good. Also 86% hospitalizations. headline highly misleading. get transported elsewhere, sometimes die enroute. That’s happening Arkansas now. I'd fact check think children passed away covid places like Florida Sweden little applied schools open. idea would happened whole US looked like Florida. lived one lock downed states country one worst deaths per Capita planet. 

Florida 7 deaths 16 270,000 cases age group. NJ 7 deaths 16 100,000 cases age group taking quick peak data. course different climates, timing, demographics data support claim regards children. mean wrong child deaths thankfully incredibly rare. 

The mortality rate low among children even right blow single flu season water. 

And add replying person said covid deaths bad flu year factually wrong, start comparison. shot, like UV bleach? have. NYC last year, certain age certain comorbidities, sent home die. 

Seems like time set triage. Vaccinated people get treatment first least tried avoid it. unvaccinated without comorbidities 60. I've always said load rocket shoot space. Kill 2 birds 1 stone. Get outta hair prove earth round. feel like there's lot overlap two groups. 'murica probably easier time getting LASD involved Orange County sheriff's department. reason OC sheriffs announced refusal enforce mask mandate OC supervisors would never actually impose mask mandate first place. Sounds like India Everybody needs get vaccinated can. Nothing easy.   Black vaccine hesitancy due long history systemic medical abuse lead lower rate vaccination among black adults.

These policies would seem disproportionately negative affect black population.

Isn't everyone talking culturally? stuff like that? Biggest issue would probably need generate lot power. Ideally want viruses stored freezers extremely cold removing heat requires substantial amount energy. saying can't done, consideration, especially using remote island/offshore platform example. 4+ million doesn’t mean anything context. weren’t exposed infected.  think we’ll see kids 12 approved? Seriously, WTF point requiring foreign travelers vaccinated half country vacationing petri dish state Florida? haven’t infected yet? 4.2 million haven’t infected exposed got vaccinated. Cause want grandparents get sick. 🎵 criminals posing mayor's towns🎵 Yep. vaccine reduces hospitalization death many cases Delta supposedly 1000x viral load, mRNA vaccines haven’t stopped infecting vaccinated individuals.

The CDC isn’t forthright breakthrough cases bet encourage vaccination. based number breakthrough cases I’ve heard firsthand, don’t believe CDCs numbers you’ve said they’re taking entire population. need way track exposed compare vaccinated vs unvaccinated. keep hearing Covid degenerating pneumonia.

I think lot parents learn last year bad made comparison.

Wonder paralytic is? year already? Doctors can't that. unethical Funny indeed... Even funnier 99.9% current Covid deaths anti-vaxxers idiots. long betting vandalized idiots? even true, really see big problem countries already well terms vaccination, long deadlier/able bypass vaccines soon let government body start making laws mandates name health..

""start""? nothing new American Apple Pie:

1775 - General Washington uses 100 Soldiers quarantine city Boston restrict travel. 
 
1776 - forced inoculation entire Northern Army 
 
1777- mandatory inoculation Continental Soldiers militiamen 
 
1777 - Thomas Jefferson drafts mandatory inoculation law citizens Virginia 
 
1770s- early 1780s - mandatory isolation hospitalizations anybody symptomatic. 
 
1793 - Benjamin Rush James Monroe assist enacting quarantining refugees Philadelphia. breaking quarantine jailed assistance citizen patrols, particularly New York, Baltimore, Norfolk. Havre de Grace sinks anybody crossing river Maryland. 
 
1780s end life - Benjamin Franklin advocates stringent public health measures face epidemics. Dr. Rush pushes government mandates sanitation. 
 
1813 - True words Constitution ‘promote General Welfare’, James Madison signs -and Congress Authorizes- government funding vaccines citizens ‘An Act Encourage Vaccination’ formation National Vaccine Institute Kissing booths State Fair? honestly makes sense. It’s group starving people access food aren’t allowed eat won’t eat.. don’t think anyone deserves die, look people medical reason unvaccinated threat immunocompromised daughter’s life. So, don’t lose sleep honest. way told drunk driver drove cliff, deserve it? No, threat others lives prior driving cliff moment longer threat.  Thank clear presentation information. reading comments article medical publication yesterday shocked number medical professionals believe vaccinated individuals wearing masks principal vector transmission justify using sources mention above. American, civilian otherwise, gotten vaccinated failed commitment country.

(since reddit, obviously mean people physically can't get vaccine).  sure China hides numbers. Reddit, time post Chinese numbers, real number 100 times higher. think negative population right now. Code bed essentially bed someone cardiac arrest something. Usually want try keep one open never know happen stocked Costco. Felt nostalgic mostly hoping chicken / TP stayed stock go round. would great idea year ago, would worked sufficient stimulus money allow people survive shelter place. Since Republicans spineless right thing Democrats enough majority force issue, we're stuck lockdown limbo enough people get vaccinated enough people die slow spread.  means ""end sarcasm"". saying statement made sarcastic. RSV really doesn’t get enough attention. kids 2 get it’s rarely fatal, know multiple kids hospital stays given oxygen. worst time possible increasing. hospitals already full. 

I hope hear good news vaccine! can’t count anyone get feel good mercy herd immunity ignorant herd.  Singapore’s putting shit. saw 25% elsewhere Sounds like here. Central Tx. even rural area really. bit north Austin. 30% vac rate I’m sure it’ll stay far number Facebook comments folks see massless about. Pfizer 88%, would think Modern similar given identical mRNA.

AZ Check Israeli data, it’s quite comprehensive showed 39% protection. health statistics, part accounted **excess deaths**. deaths beyond expected count spiked pandemic.   fair, may actually beds, staff support them.

Well, someday carry around oxygen tank everywhere go inconvenience, so....some people learn hard way! family friend thats CEO big morrocan pharmaceutical, adil zanfari genpharma. told us covid situation longterm; probably lasting 5-10 years. mainly due many people sketchy vaccine &amp; countries access them. somewhat depressing. got jnj back April felt side effects couple days. recently recovered covid many symptoms. body clearly ill never get bad. vax helped lot recovering I'm glad got jnj. family get covid vax available symptoms much worse. sounds eerily familiar, unfortunately. oh ok  comment automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

We’ve got first global pandemic hundred years, it’s getting started 600,000 Americans dead, pathetic excuses humanity can’t bothered get free shot stop it. intensity anger hatred immeasurable. could stopped pandemic tracks masks vaccine, it’s already mutated contagious, deadly. it’s going continue mutate millions die we’ll lucky world even remotely resembles world knew it’s said done. beyond consequences individual’s bad choices. consequences failed generation. IBTimes Media Bias fact check:  Yes, school start next week schools allowed mandate masks Florida, virus open season slew unvaccinated hosts. worry rivals USA view this. Absolutely this, it’s completely preventative probably best tool prevent hospitalization. *I* conspiracy theorist, I'd say stuff sounds like groundwork massive depopulation operation! I'm crazy like that. know we've told 10 days longer contagious theory would safe see them, specially vaccinated since protected, vaccinated? Studies shown vaccinated people become non contagious faster unvaccinated people would make even safer see 10 days. 


May parents speedy recovery! Students receive exemptions requirement due religious beliefs

So, vaccinations *not* required. Yo I'm loop /s mean  able figure couple trying go Canada. company also someone verify everyone's individual vaccination cards national database. absolutely possible. fair variant come people want get vaccinated. vaccine time emerged, emerged country little vaccination anyway. proof enough worry country. rich countries help poor ones get vaccinated happen again. again. You’re totally right. legitimately can’t remember Delta emerged US, CDC changed mask guidance June, that’s kind impetus. infectious Delta came one wore masks anymore. Lots careless parents putting children risk. thing anti-vaxxers understand inoculated one two ways, shot contracting Covid. lower real estate prices Florida - anyway, anyhow modifiers scenario. Considering R value measles think high 18, human population would wiped long ago.   know. feeling disease systemic. attacks entire body.  like disease attacks immune system. manifest sorts different, seemingly unrelated, ways. Pneumonia one possible consequences Covid  Everybody including waiting shoe drop UK. UK made victory lap reason... Covid's made fool many politician even put Boris Trrrrruumpppy ICU. 

They're directly related Florida used example Florida bulk south NPIs. ""If good enough UK, can't here?"" exactly comment response - selectively throwing caution wind ""ripping bandaid off"" right approach. Especially places like Florida, Arkansas, Missouri right now. 

Time tell UK situation plays out. I'm hopeful them, obviously stalk posts know I'm somewhat pessimist/realist tend give virus credit incredibly sad human response.  


What's interesting think think I'm trying scare people. That's intent all. read way disease time ability. keyboard cowboy sub there's failure levels government share real risks thing that's spreading communities. goal people make informed decision proceed. Asymptomatic covid zero risk, neither mildly symptomatic covid lot people realize incidence serious long term effects disease have. 

If listened news read journal articles, I'd totally think vaccines offer near perfect protection things could alter life happen get covid I'd either know (and completely fine) light sniffles. things created ""the masses"" true general many studies coming havn't made 24 hour news cycle.  


For anybody higher 8th grade reading level nitty gritty really spelled out. great least one country studies long covid affecting 3.2 million UK residents (just recently published)  


Enjoy evening/morning hospitals need *half* beds held Covid19 patients, since vast majority refused vaccine. Leave half open people conditions problems need help innocent people die bunch mor#ns clogging hospitals. 

Covid beds full? *shrug* Shoulda took shot! He’s jabroni code bed? Like heart stop let lie down? must tough, fighting war terrible front right home tearing everything government whistles *Dixie* plants suggestions everywhere people's minds exactly wrong things blame exactly wrong people.  Halloween prep? Thanks following July 28th Arkansas Children’s 24 covid patients. That’s 50% previous point. 

Boom is. alone sells it. 50% even worst time, pretty bad winter, tells story. 

Numbers help. aside OP outing massive racist im sure last. Get vaccinated. know better doctors scientists. Mom three kids, confirm it’s absolutely terrifying. I’ve reading spike rsv cases too. youngest sick 2 years ago horrific. knowing bad rsv alone makes want bleach damn house.

My kids check tomorrow. I’ll asking pediatrician there’s word kids vaccines available. sooner kids protected I’ll able sleep again. Maybe. Maybe card exceptions contacted San Francisco’s administration voice concerns? taking Pfizer vaccine getting J&amp;J’s also entitled? Curious line exactly given they’re giving booster that’s authorized.  Banned ? That's fucked up.  Dad 67 one favorite people world. I'm sorry father, can't imagine mine going that.  one calling zero. Let’s see get below, say, 10k solid month recalibrate know outlook is, yeah? Small endemic hot spots instead whole country fire. people expecting masks distancing forever thing we've much deadly pandemics/plagues history restrictions never lasted forever before? That’s scientists do. worry think possible scenarios. Least 40 Children Admitted Hospitals COVID Monday They’ve tried nothing they’re ideas!  I’m definitely okay getting people sick get fired ig get fired... I’m bad position lose job I’m facing serious hardship sick. I’m scared if/when get fired, I’ll fucked. true. know people flew family members Ecuador get vaccinated here, Texas actually. It’s available super easy here. they’re willing pay airfare, week time, get vaccinated. Pfizer Phase III. think forgot us. It’s rare cases myocarditis mild resolve own. they’re typically seeing younger men. convince doctor perhaps? It’s honestly really impressive given size US. It’s shame people less impressive. 

Thank you, last dose next week, looking forward double protection! seemed blitz older folks, guess main thing, seem bit slower we’ve reached younger people. guess demand still high it’s good way Yup. Never back saw it. lil New Yorkish downtown Israeli cases seem following trajectory UK cases. think Boris got lucky plus many UK population got ravaged covid March 20th restrictions lifted. makes sad :( virtual hugs. patient eligible vaccine didn’t get it? went Florida 7 days. Disney, universal tons cash spent. I’m waiting see got covid family fun tons people jobs there. Mom right maybe realize. people freak anything bad happens others overcome adapt. need solid therapeutics government afraid focus less vaccines (that’s guess why). Wife vaccines would even comfortable knowing government approved Leronlimab therapy worth money incase got virus severe reaction. Regardless, went tried worry there. Kids young vaccines nurse part hurts, don’t blame them. Corporate hospitals purposely forcing nurses carry unsafe workloads. sister nurse way colleagues treated horrendous. name profit. That’s criminal. Seriously - he’s preventing people getting medical care.  wonder might Oh sure it’s good news due selection bias vaccine effective enough virus mutated render vaccination useless. excited that. 

Guess what, break cases, unless gigantic effort put place (it’s won’t be), continue spread. That’s evolution works. started homeschooling last year shit show.

My kids 2 hours work day across different subjects, supplement educational things throughout week like National Geographic shows, science experiments, physical activity (walks/playground).

I'm saying easy, less difficult people think. Homeschooling 8 hours day. What's wrong free condoms? work sexual health harm reduction. free condoms given means fewer cases syphilis need track everyone for. know anytime someone catches syphilis job get partners in? Even go username? much fun, learning ways find people get talk. ""holiday travel season"", linked Obon, bit later, around August 15th. Pediatric COVID-19 cases, always high, continues rise Palm Beach County School District’s first day school set August 10th.

I know people think schools anywhere stay open regardless mask mandates. Many seem focus kids outside school. throw away 2-8 doses Moderna days people aren’t interested getting vaccinated. Anyone age 18+ needs ask get it. can't care people care themselves.  vaccine available months. Monoclonal antibody treatments literally sitting shelves doctors don’t even know exist.

It basically routine 70 year old gets covid take get antibody treatment yet somehow isn’t call doctor hospital they’d probably confused talking about. really. I'm honestly baffled statement his. real plausible mechanism basically every immunologist agrees. seems trend here. bothers articles come touting .002% dangerous. vaccines awesome saving ton lives bulletproof media government tout states gives people false sense security...the one's i'm worried elderly vulnerable may vaxxed back December January. people need careful, surrounded massive amount Delta infected non-vaxxed idiots. Also 60. likely already significant risk factor sort thing. Kentuckian here, governor everything keep us save...and...fellow Kentuckians decided hang effigy noose...outside house.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  Numerator almost certainly correct, denominator almost certainly undercounted know never tell wtf going America, many Americans fucking great people. Met many top notch Americans kind generous smart, rubbish ones rubbish. 

And it’s vaccines, seems age old problem America. every issue, people seem go bizarre extremes. seems vocal part population loves conspiracies loves contradict loves put people down. It’s confusing. 

If helps though, think lot us foreigners really thinking sane ones hoping things work you, many issues. guys really deserve *normality* Link that, anything find animals released prior press release company says discontinuing development...I'm pretty sure discontinue development product could actually provide sterilizing immunity combination vaccines people. July 27th, CDC updated [guidance fully vaccinated recommending everyone wear mask indoor public settings [areas substantial high regardless vaccination status. decision made data science available CDC time, including valuable public health partnership resulting rapid receipt review unpublished data. 
   [data published CDC’s Morbidity Mortality Weekly Report demonstrating Delta infection resulted similarly high SARS-CoV-2 viral loads vaccinated unvaccinated people. High viral loads suggest increased risk transmission raised concern that, unlike variants, vaccinated people infected Delta transmit virus. finding concerning pivotal discovery leading CDC’s updated mask recommendation. masking recommendation updated ensure vaccinated public would unknowingly transmit virus others, including unvaccinated immunocompromised loved ones. sudden concern certain elements vaccine distribution third-world countries reeks coordinated talking point. Thank info. I'm glad hear lasting damage. sounds like shes afraid might cases lasting damage dont yet information answer concerns. Florida report this, allow institutional disclosure data. “When allow rage uncontrolled parts world get vaccine them, virus keep mutating,"" said.” 

As anti- vax covidiots right uS aren’t equally blame . everyone would rolled sleeves chance , maybe delta danger wouldn’t happened . anticipate covid apocalypse, science tries grapple newer , better vaccine .. covidiots still likely refuse. fucked . Also NY isnt seeing massive rise hospiralizations south has. look like UK (still averging single digit deaths despite rise cases month I’m glad I’m crazy thinking :( Sounds like straight reports read India back May.

\*Shudders\* knew spreading new years travel happening care, spreading world. first known American case due wuhan flight. never actually eradicated it. Damn that's messed up. think well aware. you’re constantly telling people follow science year, it’s somewhat hypocritical scientific organization make non scientific recommendations. science said people vaccinated didn’t need wear masks. Speculation people’s actions isn’t scientific. acting like isn’t case gives power anti maskers say they’re trustworthy. hope. even would likely take months. Florida full online school available free also offer ""Flex"" programs homeschoolers supplement classes subjects need them.

I'm also Florida homeschooling year along flex classes FLVS. made decide test? Playing ""allergies covid"" post-vaccination like hard mode. Get vaxxed people! US walk clinic pharmacy pretty much anywhere country get shot already appt. They've widespread availability many months now.

I'm surprised 30 still waiting UK, thought got younger age groups now. Hope comes soon. Vaccines thee, seems game plan ""Good news, shortened wait time!"" 😖 might largely true back March 2020 fuckin August 2021. many people updated information regarding this. like fighting WWII 1941 intelligence reports 1939. r/LeopardsWordFace outbreaks legionaires disease upscale hotels...all sanitize ductwork. Crazy stuff. read before. specified dual vaccine approach - worked (sterilizing immunity) people already possessed antibodies. Neither stat particularly useful. holds true higher vaccination rate vaccinated population skews older, higher percentage overall severe infections vaccinated. 100% vaccination reach 100%. saying vaccinated make x% deaths useful stat. “So like massive reset button, we’re back Feb 2020” don’t know that, mean could probably (hopefully) easily modify existing vaccines. Like I’m pretty sure flu every year Like Indonesia couple weeks ago, problem supply oxygen, [but Yup better safe sorry right now. Ffs.. Best luck family wish best! realize post hours initial post asking question right? one actually answered question. people mad told lambda concerning, escape variant know say. Nurses getting 4x pay travel nurses. something get. lambda variant exhibits three mutations spike commensurately higher vaccine resistance. VOCs gotten stronger (more virulent/deadly), weaker. COVID started partially adapted infect human cells, gotten better it. That’s frustrating. can’t even imagine angry must you’ve lost loved ones illness opportunity get protected, idiots turn fucking stupid reasons. I’d want shake them! vaccine could saved dad best friend wife, completely rejected people think know better true. 60% fully vaccinated (minus small number got 2nd shot last 2 weeks). 70% first doses only.

I think full FDA approval matter, firmly believe vast majority anti vaxxers care. FDA approval comes, using excuse, move next one.

Also importantly vaccination numbers lower states shit going sideways. really kind pointless look entire US since state handling pandemic totally differently. Never take preclinical data mice gospel. Here's latest news AdCOVID. show good immune response humans phase 1 trial development discontinued.  21 years old could vaccinated. 🤷🏼‍♀️ It’s Jersey knucklehead get right. Same, look laws said endangering others road drunk driving harshly punished means illegal passengers case talk distract driver radios totally banned new cars Oh boy, optimism *severely* misplaced.

We swimming vaccine. Vaccine clinics close every urgent care center, pharmacy, grocery store, WalMart vaccine - free ready go anywhere country. Even backwoods, remote parts country get vaccine half hour's drive.

There barriers. 100% free. need health insurance. even need provide ID get it. write name form, get it. amazing, life-saving vaccine, free. vast majority Americans even ability choose vaccine want. still, 30% us refuse get microchips alien DNA what-the-fuck-ever.

America absolute embarrassment humanity ashamed American. I'm sorry. disagree general point, *anyone* year removed vaccine time? Good There’s bright line, century pandemic appears appropriate time. 

Also, can’t bypass checks balances. still constitution, courts, etc. Go elect representatives think handle better. One nurse covers number people. Three nurses cover number people around clock. three nurses leave, schedules need rearranged nurses need take patients cover slack. limit far stretch eventually ""bed"", ability care single person gets removed. situation get better, however, eventually repeat itself. Seems reasonable stab active cases. sure, data perfect. Imagine able say nearly 100% employees fully vaccinated. Sounds like great recruitment material. I'd hope so, too, certainly assured

Source: Attending university vaccine mandate reinstituted mask mandate feel get smoked fucking *Canada*? Archie Bunker used ""meathead"" though. get 4th 5th months too.   vaccines meant 2 shot dose boosters stlll analyzed. Considering many people world 0 vaccines saying wealthy countries giving boosters yet. Could yes, will...well beta lambda resistant yet pfizer still holds well acording Chile. I'm betting  call people morons wonder feel compelled spend time responding 🤷‍♂️ big difference is, drunk driver hospital can't kill anyone else. problem Java right now, cases dropping fast Java. cramped, even remote village Java 4-5 hours away hospitals big cities.  Java's total land area smaller New York state.

The problem right outside Java. could take 2-3 days get hospital. hospitals enough ventilators, death rate high. Secondly, first time many places hit hard Covid. Slipper Slope fallacy anyways doesn’t matter since vaccines mandated past face pandemic still mandated non pandemic times. Argument doesn’t really apply, already shit nothing happened. It’s stupid you’ve done much better job distribution seems like less uptake. It’s really impressive get vaccine quickly, it’s real shame people dragging feet I'm fine businesses establishing rules. I'm cool government mandates businesses discriminate turn customers, especially emergency over. Think new rules NYC look Bronx vax rate makes population. I'm vaccinated, covid. previous infection frowned upon? straight. 4.2 million kids tested positive 526 deaths? playing even one death, want make sure I’m understanding right. .0125% death rate age? confused 1.25% rate know vaccine would effective **actual** virus going body?

Because actual virus evolved evade immune system. That's part effective vaccines target spike protein instead using whole virus. presented whole virus, immune system necessarily focus right thing may fail actually generate useful immune response. may generate immune response works specific variant variants. **Aug. 5, 00:00 (UTC+9)**

The land cali nice , people sucks guess Pensacola bracing still oxygen. didn’t even know gov HR thing... thank telling this.

It’s really hard feel valid situation. isn’t first time I’ve dealt kind thing, first time I’ve gotten kind advice deal it. 

To honest, I’m sure anybody know aware kind HR thing either.. Didn’t desantis say hospitalizations slowing down? know challenge trials?

And required release findings? Covid 19 US problem, global problem, look delta variant, came India terrible health care sanitation, add low vaccination rates breeding ground mutations develop, that's one example, imagine less developed countries situation.
All Variants eventually spread around world thing vaccinated try get rest world providing vaccines less fortunate countries, expect truly control majority world vaccinated, hopefully time mutate something really deadly fact restaurants bars really work masks really need reserved vaccinated only. Weird…this sounds like Philly parade 1918. He’s probably going catch it. It’s probably going mild.

Also he’s probably going spread you’ll end catching him. would get act smugly superior Internet? work one aforementioned Walmart stores. routinely give one Moderna vaccine 14-dose vial end wasting rest noone else wants one goes bad. Pfizer vaccine. We'll give two three Pfizer vaccines throughout 12-hour shift waste 10 doses 2 vials. even bat eye waste anymore. I’m free, entire pandemic. perception “unfree” CA accurate. 

I also find CA beautiful. It’s got mountains, beaches, deserts(lots them), rainforests, lakes, rivers, big cities, small towns, everything between. 

Not saying Florida ugly, don’t need state ugly mine beautiful. like restaurants.  We're throwing away expired vaccine many cases. Sad true. Sometimes feels like Canada guy quietly sipping tea porch whilst watching circus next door burn haha It’s felony people already getting popped feds it. It’s never going away. It’s far contagious. learn live eventually get point it’s dangerous literally insane Thanks vaccinated, free 5G watch Netflix 👍

/S  Let’s get carried away. governor isn’t intentionally setting specifically murder entire group people.

He doesn’t… care. agree. made choice. dumb, immunity infection good better variants. Im convalescent don’t plan getting vaccine! Sue favorite story guy swearing asthma right died.

“While don’t specific data point, regular conversations hospitals around state, report us 95% hospitalized COVID-19 patients fully vaccinated,” Savannah Kelly, director communications Florida Hospital Association, told us important note Florida elsewhere, vaccinated population skews older (close 90% 65+ vaccinated, lower younger age groups), percentages remarkable context. see vaccination numbers creep up, relative percentages vaccinated climb well. This. raised Pentecostal (not snake-handling, actually quite tame Pentecostal standards) and, I’ve liberalized good bit, I’m still fairly religious. church understands Bible 100% literal (in fact, lot pretty explicitly allegorical), abusing people differing beliefs wrong.

Funny. start pandemic friends took footage coming Wuhan seriously tried convince boomer parents problem government probably shut borders. 


But nope. Even March 2020 Canadian government started telling people stay home, boomer parents insisted continuing life normal. we're here. Schrodinger's breakthrough cases here:

1. talking vaccine effectiveness, people often claim breakthrough cases extremely rare;
2. point means CFR breakthrough cases really high then, claim breakthrough cases much common know.

Now, actual point: yes, breakthrough cases Mass probably lot higher 8k, there's complication people likely get severe COVID likely vaccinated first place could likely get breakthrough case die COVID (say, immune system sucks). Thanks breaking down. love seeing comments top headlines fear mongering. studied 200 adults **60 older f**rom Argentina infected Covid-19. think Archie Bunker words would preferred use certain groups people... Yes, Post 9/11 Montgomery GI Bill benefits would lost. Post 9/11 HUGE benefit. fully paid 4 years tuition stipend living expenses. passed spouse child. passed mine daughter paid almost $100K BSN. Pretty much zero pocket me. Certainly nothing sneeze at.

It also effects ability reenlist join another service.

I can't see going General refusing vaccine, SECDEF could put policy handle refusals. Everyone knew refused anthrax vaccine received General.  Last year's attendance Sturgis 462,000 people. number actually 7% normal years. event considered super spreader. year imagine attendees come greater numbers, unmasked unvaxxed. One hope Rally another super spreader.

One hope. sister nurse practitioner specializes cardiac care. She’s getting offered 4K per week plus accommodations go Texas Florida right now.

There’s massive shortage qualified staff. knew somebody died 2 days sfter getting vaccinated. older recovered real covid tho. Vaccinations saving lives, it'd good idea wait month getting vaccinated recovered covid. Maybe I'm reading wrong time press release (and subsequent reprints) seemed clear aiming EUA standalone vaccine. (relatively tiny sample) test results meet goal, stopped. believe took place time creating vaccine offered basic protection masses focus; obvious breakthrough cases course variants continue emerge, think warrants revisiting adjusting goal intentionally use combination Pfizer, Moderna, etc.

Their previous influenza intranasal vaccine worked subjects ab; reading lines, modeled similar fashion yield anticipated results subjects *didn't* SARS COV2 ab. insinuate *would* work subjects ab, believe say must data supports it. again, initial goal; wanted company vaccine all.

Also..devil's advocate myself... I'd like see hard data either way. Toss bleach too. Maybe little hydrochloric acid. Really scrub Covid away. point what’s alternative? think start asking happen virus come ppl held accountable full vax count, case? measures partial immunity. Damn, could lockdowns, mass testing, proper contact tracing...but would take cooperation moderate amount government funding. Oh well! Ok. draw line specifically? saying base number lethality contagion level.. rather many people going hospital it? Again.. that's fine standard. where's line specifically? many people need hospitalized consider ""flooded enough mandate""? deleted 😔 facts win  I’m gonna preface saying ALWAYS wash hands using bathroom

But find kinda silly guy since don’t touch anything pant’s waistband pee. Pretty much public restrooms touch toilets point. Touching random things throughout day probably makes hands dirtier trip bathroom Ah yes, vaccines surely help millenials unending wage stagnation housing crisis, exacerbated lockdowns put place save boomers dying. 


You're welcome.  different citing pseudo science avoid getting vaccine. (medical community) studies, regulatory review, make decisions ensure consistency across country. Allowing people take boosters impulse intuition asking chaos. vaccinate kids handing boosters? *probably* safe. 🇺🇲🦅😎 sub headline article 100 deaths 4.2 million vaccinated people. That’s pretty low death rate.

The death rate unvaccinated people really low go that. real problem getting boosters delays vaccinating Africa India 2023 later. Next thing know there's Psi variant fully resists antibodies conceals spike protein T-cells sending us back 2020. mean do, but... haven’t really back anything. I’ve points taken away things didn’t even know could pointed (things coworkers tell can’t pointed) refuse fix it. even took vacation days last season supposed taking sick leave injuries.

This bothering day.

Fortunately, again, [Zeynep comes rescue. Yep. every time I’ve ever seen reported it’s 99% unvaccinated. Thats it? 5% increase cases last Wednesday, believe lowest increase week week seen since spike started.

Maybe nearing/at peak? think meant write ""selfish"". one L. Agree though. Hospitals flooded unvaccinated. long must entire society few? Definitely require US citizens fully vaccinated leave country. would want someone leave come back, would travel insurance want delay covid likely ass. What's point first thing then? demanding 3rd dose it’s advised yet selfish. 2 doses vaccines protected understanding, chicken pox leave body. lies dormant nerve cells, process allow virus replicated (so reinfection). However, dormant virus reactivated nerve cells, result shingles. Hospitals Virginia still outpatient surgery people wandering around. saw masked. ever really come vaccine resistent variant

Why everyone burying head sand here. Delta absolutely vaccine resistant variant. Provincetown outbreak 3/4 vaccinated 4/5 hospitalizations vaccinated.

My 3yo caught covid week cold completely lost smell today. Like stick nose thing cinnamon get nothing gone. honest ventured library click collect books, still older teens whatever wanted. adhered told (unhappily) visa guest here. However, adhered told, real support bubble, totally alone. Yeah, high demand end matters big time. US shows supply world 30% country refuses take matter.

Here Canada along lines UK, less supply quite vaccines got demand huge vaccinations shot way up. IIRC 10% ahead US first second shots. raw numbers ? Unfortunately, trying right thing probably mean get reelected. 😕 sounds horrible. assume you’re relatively young you’re still working too. It’s really scary illness, obviously worth getting jabbed go that. Really can’t fathom people deliberately turning down, stories people dying saying “I wish hadn’t turned now!” 🙄🙄🙄. willing gamble lives aren’t apparently dont think exemption cant get vaccine? Okay, returning flights EU leave Florida. jail time banned campuses around country covid bad people sides keep saying it’s political. It’s not. never was. everything is. Glad fun! agree, treatment deserves research funding. Especially ends long term battle.

I don’t think people realize fast vaccines came out. well they’ve worked, it’s amazing feat. It’s shame they’re gradually losing efficacy new strains, saving lives. they’ve succeeded developing groundwork needed face pandemic head on.

For severely needed polio vaccine was, took decades develop. People forget that. LA bunch literally never gone downtown lol. It’s weird it’s like opposite cities outskirts much nicer mean difference outside park around people vs packed shoulder shoulder thousands people. I've sort done rant , CDC dropping ball running challenge trials . 

There challenge trial done every new variant comes , letting Lambda spread without knowing vax effectiveness . ever really come vaccine resistent variant , know way late contain ramp specific vaccine it.

Same questions around boosters good . 

All questions could answered 2 weeks safe challenge trial. risk would low stage pandemic patients could watched doctors closely given latest treatments . thank god state US take measures restrict movement. could have, population would tolerated it. justifiably so. got anthrax shoulder? thought got booty... guy really one biggest pieces shit I've ever heard of. Look. Payments Rolls Royce private jet don’t stop tithing stops. saved click: ...in infected patients mean planned several months ago. thought mend long everyone vaccinated. Lol governor fucking idiot. He’s going reinstate mask mandate, let alone lockdown. We’re gonna fucked refuse believe it. like refuse believe masks vaccines. Honestly, point, gop successfully destroyed base lies, hate, violence, disease. many people traveling USA get vaccinated. US vaccines huge help around Latin America, even Asia.

I guess would end that, hopefully places would vaccines time kicks off.  That’s great. don’t know people expect. New Mexico nearly populated north eastern states. Much harder get people get vaccinated don’t even give shit let alone others Sydney fudged lockdown, that's got away them. done right works.  Right, what's difference viral load symptomatic vs asymptomatic?

This would answer important question: I'm vaccinated feel sick (but perhaps I'm asymptomatic infected), likely hurt anybody go without mask/social distancing? Source: trust bro deadlier Delta. They're here, can't compete it. would love vaccinated, US citizen abroad I'm unable so. :D Typically, beds advanced life support equipment (like ventilators) ICU beds. available beds going help covid patients much. Uuum. far people vaccinated US, since think mid July ish.

Apparently ""extraordinary measures"" test isolate something gotten R0 bad chicken pox. 

Kids start school September 

Kids 12 can't vaxed kid covid means would still allowed go school (I mean test apparently could cold flu something even cases reported last winter)

Of domestic cases, four reported New Taipei one Taipei Taoyuan, CECC said.

Two domestic cases known source infection, four investigation, said.

Meanwhile, CECC reported five new imported COVID-19 cases zero deaths disease Thursday.

The five imported cases involved four men one woman 20s 60s, arrived Taiwan July 21 Aug. 3, one Nigeria South Africa three United States, CECC said.

The new cases bring total Taiwan 15,753, 14,256 domestic infections reported since May 15, country first recorded 100 COVID-19 cases single day, according CECC data.

Between May 11 Aug. 3, 14,522 COVID-19 cases reported Taiwan, CECC said, adding 89.5 percent them, 13,001 people, released isolation.

To date, 791 people died COVID-19 Taiwan, including 779 since May 15.

Taiwan received 9.5 million doses COVID-19 vaccines, including 5.8 million AstraZeneca vaccines 3.7 million Moderna.

As Thursday, 8.6 million people Taiwan, 36.6 percent population, received least one dose COVID-19 vaccine, 437,270 gotten second shot, CECC data shows.

Could put quarantine upon arrival keep em weeks, though. going find people willing work $12 hour replace them? Wow! Nice. idiots looking “experimental cure” instead getting “experimental” vaccine begin with. bunch of... I’m sorry numbers confuse you. Letting Delta circulate among lowly vaccinated population considered option here.

We're bumpy ride we're highly vaccinated around November - January-ish viable alternative approaches. similar level effort maintain count, takes stopping exponential spread. difference 0 compelling advantages over, say, Covid 250 (as Sydney seems doing), cases vaccinations far away exceed ""natural immunity"" acquired wave.

So may well aim zero, ways locking vaccinations sufficient prevent healthcare overwhelmed.

Remember, Florida 3x Australia's vax rate due rather botched rollout here, lack mRNA supply. mean surprise anyone? It’s Mississippi. much anyone passport. last like 10 years. Let ask question.

That's good science, albeit double triple announcing. kind job make sure product still working lol one avoided worse side effects apparently benefit.  interesting, makes sense. really missed opportunity headline. lame. pick choose X-rays fit narrative. kind deceptive messaging lets anti-vaxxers find fault pro-vaccination movement. No, that's really factual. World cultures fundamentally different reason one humanity, common roots, live reality created creator. Universals apply universally. people west seem disagree oligarchs, hard right ""no false gods"" monotheistic theocrats, militants, white supremacists, guys credible capable representing free West. Genuine question here, easy quickly count number ICU beds entire state accurately? Delta virus goes brrrrrrrr... they’ll closed borders snap lockdowns end time? Yikes. fully vaccinated individual I’d much rather Florida China. hospitals “open business” according Desantis (whatever tf means) Last heard, hospitals texas pretty much diversion. makes worst live rural area hospital present MI, going get transferred facility resources treat you. best get stay highest acuity level care provided rural hospital hope best. problem seeing. covid patients worried about, strokes, MI, types severe accidents need higher care rural hospital problem. Right accident, better severe enough warrant airlife take straight level 3 trauma center scene! research database. don’t think identifiable recorded.

That needs deidentification implies identification possible. possible know exactly medical history. There's need suddenly worry used science. may concern people (regressive) albinism gene identified genocide, data. People trust data used harm. I'm pretty sure ACA (Obamacare) prevents insurance dropping unvaccinated. that's good thing, IMO. ultimate Reddit headline. think people subreddit care non urban US does.

Interesting description virus. comment seems rather random me. people get shots (with delta variant dominant) less susceptible covid next February, aged well. good news Springfield, MO (our canary delta coal mine) peaked cases decline.

Places currently fire might far bad news is, Florida shot Springfield's cases per capita like nothing still headed up. I'm sure reflects better testing Florida, local attitudes primary determinant peak (probably that). sane people microdose psychedelics therapist daily handle madness. makes think normal fucking trip drugs make us sober realty being. Finally read links another post made elsewhere. Honestly, stuff getting bit head glad people way smarter working. saw post zoo animals getting vaccines. It’s mind boggling virus spread far wide quickly so. Really puts world wide pandemic perspective. Thank making aware studies, don’t think ever would come across own! Lord sent fix....... Yet heed. personal experience family friends got Moderna much severe side effects (fever, chills, myalgia) vs Pfizer kinda leads believe Moderna might pack bigger punch. We'll find soon enough studies Moderna get published. always make excuse something work. According thinking process would finish minuscule amount time effective, simply unrealistic. ""pandemic unvaccinated"" line disgusting, short-sighted logic. really ""pandemic unvaccinated"" healthcare workers used human sandbags flood disease? vaccinated end needing hospital care COVID surge? facilitated *unvaccinated*, vaccinated. Vaccination confers protection infection, less Delta before, still significant protection. Imagining fully protected 100% vaccinated society, virus never gets ground enough area actually mutate. fact, society, every single host tries move another barrier significantly reduces ability spread fizzles out. 

Even given vaccine resistant strain, still better totally vaccinated country whatever resistance vaccine still confers, some, still improve situation. reduces symptom duration 10%? That's 10% less time infectious, protects 10% people symptomatic infection? Thats 10% less people spread to, etc etc actual details Emergency Use Authorization FDA Approval really things people care anyway. smokescreen anti-vaxxers.

The vaccines given Emergency Use Authorization gone rigorous testing proven safe. fairness, even smartest Americans seem ignore rest planet exists.  😂😂😂

I’m glad think numbers useful

99.99% US haven’t died causes year, things looking good! totally agree.

And point should. People stupid design power politicians set budgets. Houston Reminder vaccinated individuals **punished** choices unvaccinated.

Does make anyone else angry?  Well live lives. everything correct get less severe covid non vaccinated. 

So either wil start dying get sick see personal surroundings. probably convince get vaccine. 

Or nothing happens right along. Although afraid happen. 

Either way still situation 3 years now. Ok next variant around corner then. Everyone never going get vaccinated. knew beginning. stats billboards along routes get there

[Vaccine FAQ Part FAQ Part appointment bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* bullshit, math.  Here's basic equation needed, scientific leaders use basis recommending protections not. 


R = 3 *(1-P*v)

R reproductive rate virus. greater 1.0, means continue spread current environment. Less 1.0 means diminish eventually 0

The (3) equation CoVIDs natural R rate. 

V efficiency rate vaccine, let's say 95%. 

P percentage population vaccinated. 

So currently R US is:

3 *(1-.50*.95) = 1.4215 

To 1.0, need least 65% population vaccinated. 

HOWEVER...the delta variant natural R 6 8. equation much harder get 1.0.


Mask wearing effectively lower R rating reducing ability spread. recommended. higher percentage population gets vaccine, would clear. COVID continue GROW

PS sure 90% 2 weeks comment coming from? never claimed that. withstood 4K hospitals height pandemic weren’t rationing care. got bunch top tier hospitals think we’ll fine lol think deserve this, retire early live wonderful life. Society failed trashed hold dear (medical sciences, preventative care, ofc CARE). SAY deserve better deserve BEST. Im sorry happening you, sadly people think fake. Sure sure. long people usually occupying bed? never know interpret stats obviously isn’t good 6 ***Get vaccine*** works

Problem I'm story shared people fb feed evidence work. assume Batman proposing Europe allows vaccinated US tourists in. way, unvaccinated US citizens returning US Europe, fewer people bring new virus loads (even risk zero).  kids ability manage remote schooling themselves. kids got pretty good it, still tell classes starting, roll bed midday naps, help find lost supplies, assist technical issues, etc. mind remote school definitely required presence. Adding unvaccinated people population makes sense. however issue mixed mRNA vaccination common Canada shipment delays. encouraged mix vaccinations meant waiting weeks. university age Canadians might also among AstraZeneca/mRNA mixes (though us older, timing stopped offering AZ first doses. Issues coming Canadians places recognizing us fully vaccinated. It'll probably work long, people deal earlier. don’t think it’s fauci issue.. people don’t like he’s attached politics wh… leave scientists politics, would’ve different place.. always react instead proactive.. Bit hyperbolic there, lad. China knows deal shit. People want someone angry opressed shout differently, simple fact China old hats comes viruses know shit. Watch squash month back normal, again.

My sense going hard get back.  considering job health care this, I’d reconsider. lets see well ages... get reminder 6 months? study found remains 84% effective 6 months.

The point is, reporting 6 months already March/April? Given trials going year point, seeing 9+ month reports instead rehashing 6 month ones data available March?  God wish legal kick unvaccinated let car crash victim bed.  Ive seen friendships decade blown apart time again. It’s truly sad. Well, look things practical side. Very, going end dying new surge delta variant vaccinated. every hospital, unvaccinated make overwhelming majority patients. almost entirely people engage said willful ignorance going end dead. 


It's horrible thing say, way they're us favor removing society, DEFINITELY us favor eliminating voting citizenry, heck they're even humanity general favor removing gene pool. financial quarterly report, assume put best possible light. Realistically. Covid killed Americans WW2.
We war.

Yet politicians think reelection pleasing whims voter base who’s afraid needles like 3 years old dad heart attack January told “lucky” lull covid infections city. Following quad bypass he’s playing tennis six months later. heart goes vaccinated people children might get subpar healthcare antivax F%CKS.  blame himself? use love watching baseball back 80s 90s etc it’s terrible.

Actually go r/nursing see plenty people's last words denying virus killing exists. Well proposing exactly? Please help put bad situation medical system right favoring covidiots terribly unfair. really need know let Canadians. Seriously, exact variant makeup do. Mandatory would good step well course, Australia's biggest challenge vaccination mandatory, rollout vaccine incredibly poorly handled. much ""people want get vaccinated"" ""people can't find vaccine get hoops involved"" ""people fine waiting Pfizer appointments rather getting Astra Zeneca"". Making mandatory would still problems people accessing vaccine Australia.


For getting 80%, expect countries to, point, allow children vaccinated. US under-12 population, example, 50 million, 14%. vaccination children 50%, country get 80% vaccinated demographics US, country would need 73% population vaccinated under-12 population get vaccinated.

So question countries reached point (using 73% rule thumb) they'd hit least 80% kids vaccinated. OurWorldinData, Malta Iceland already past fully vaccinated, looking fully partially vaccinated people (presuming partially vaccinated still going complete vaccination), Uruguay Chile would well.

If presumption kids would vaccinated rate rest population (so presuming something like mandating vaccines school), threshold would 69%. digging precise vaccine qualifications country, countries already least 69% population partially fully vaccinated would include Singapore, Canada, Belgium, Spain, Portugal, UK, Denmark, Netherlands.

None allows additional adults start getting vaccinated, either. DING DING DING DING

This bad hospitals get overwhelmed, even people dying left right. Corona like freezer Dragon Ball Z Cases aren’t falling stable Here's article native Canada, based statements Phizer Moderna par course first-world nations: hope convinces people. understand desensitization news - becomes local, even scarier Yes please. best way get people something take things away comply. EU allowed lot vaccine exports mostly rich countries like Japan, Israel, UK, Canada, US others. much donated much Africa. honestly believe 'internet' blame, gives us harmless way vent rage nothing changes. (And yes, grew internet)

Before, mad enough way voice heard show somewhere. Make enough people mad, lots people show somewhere voice heard.

Now, gripe reddit sign online petition, go stressful lives.  3rd dose boosts antibodies (and probably B cells), giving immune system a.. well.. boost. 

There lot evidence giving spare doses undeveloped countries work, terrible infrastructure vaccine hesitancy. Millions doses sub-Saharan Africa gone waste. 

Then bad management, politicians. Places like Malaysia infrastructure high uptake, available. doses sent there, they'd used quickly eagerly. problem is, politicians set enough funds aside vaccinate whole population, they're waiting queue. money public, populist politicians allowed religious gatherings continue spend budget what's necessary. know guy saying ""cases up, deaths aren't, need masks anymore!"" 

Yeah, hopefully deaths stay low we'll see week. I’m sorry loss. utterly ridiculous. know infected vaccinated people spread Covid, means it’s immune response ffs Fully vaccinated people test negative pose risk Americans stop pretending otherwise.  surge forcing hospitals prioritize treatment Covid-19 patients others.

This one worst parts this. Hearing hospital staff mentally prepare triage horrifying. act turning people away - able provide individual care would many patients sad. wish gave hospital staff care taking virus seriously preventing people enter ER first place way. know reasonably safe vaccinated people gather indoors. allow without subjecting additional risk people refuse help themselves. Nurses strike couple weeks. I’m calling it… What’s saying? “Play stupid games…” Alright, well everyone going get vaccinated, fully vaccinated individuals supposed do? local hospital system one them. 8 weeks day FDA approves better vaxx'd job.  true app, people still getting pinged time without sat on- hence people deleting Oklahoma 0 beds period. shipping people Texas. Imagine hospital bil ambulance ride. round-about way, killing voter base. don’t know hole I’m trying dig point think proved. Plenty vaccinated people harmed too. fully vaccinated person heart attack can't get adequate care?  significant lot companies use moment start requiring staff previously. Ok guys, follow virus help out. I've hearing mixed messages (like always) this. ask, want stress vaccinated.

Ok, so. Delta Variant vaccine proof? appears be. is, unvaccinated people's fault new big deal? like fighting army undead. matter many walking corpses skeletons warriors knock down, get keep coming. one forever. Many US states decided encourage reasonable precautions, actively legislated it. creating army warriors fight. course warriors going walk away. What's point continue fighting? Gosh, someone would warned her. Lol, piece shit. That's article says. US plenty oxygen. Since longer state emergency Fl, hospitals less ways getting it. wonder future mental health fallout this. Certain states almost purposely pushing hospital staff breaking point. Ahem…Sackerfice   Oklahoma 0. announced yesterday. worthless stupid statistic 100 8000 reported breakthrough cases died.

But whatever. fine vaccine represented, don’t get risk everything. you. remember parents manually ventilating polio patients ran iron lungs polio epidemic. Maybe doomed repeat history.  perhaps stop spreading misinformation. coronavirus anything completely normal. 

From NATGEO article

""Researchers U.S. Department Agriculture (USDA) analyzed blood samples 600 deer Michigan, Illinois, New York, Pennsylvania past decade, discovered 40 percent 152 wild deer tested January March 2021 **antibodies SARS-CoV-2,** virus causes COVID-19. Another three deer January 2020 also antibodies.""  exact number hard say. uk data suggests that's absolutely true. number amount vaccinated people, mostly pre delta, Usa, ended hospitalized, relatively people general did.

It's incredibly effective hospitalization. Something like 15 17 fold reduction. several orders magnitude though. number silly supported data. Cases aren’t dropping stable around 20k-30k, going aren’t allowed anymore yes you’re right, used Thank you. comforting.

This whole situation really stressful. family everything stay safe. really frustrating many anti-vax covid... think everyone wants ""over"". mean numbers go lower levels, since always here. dilusional.

Honestly, mostly hand full states point pulling rest them. Yes, manufacturing capacity research effort...

I wish clearer explanation use human vaccine. Possibly expired doses it.

The quantity trivial, driving across town zoo actually possible, unlike legal logistical challenge putting plane.

We working redistribute large quantities, tiny bit can't sent far.

The bigger issue toketatr supply issues going forward. Chances going need capacity fir something new novel, meantime mRNA tech looks promising better solution familiar diseases we've less flexible vaccines, yet successfully one worth using all. pretty much happened nyc. one outside nyc seemed care acted like deserved living city.  US, bet someome would arguing staff discount hospital bill. least admit mental development children.  Baby steps. aren’t boosters supposed specific Delta variant

No. There's work things ongoing trails take while. Right talking giving 3rd dose existing vaccine concerned pandemic would helped doses going countries people access vaccine. 

It's debate good points sides that's honestly pay grade. Still are…. look current numbers doesn’t look like it’s heading way think misunderstood; certainly hope others country get access vaccine soon. point ""how could selfish getting booster developing countries vaccine yet"" statement turning lot recently anti-vaxxers, anti-maskers pandemic-deniers never gave half thought developing countries before. pure concern-trolling.

None meant deny lot countries still without vaccine, hopefully get soon. can't mail extra dose people developing countries mail surplus food eat. TRASH BAGS UNFUCKING ACCEPTABLE!!!
What hell!! trying dedication staff, bullshit. Where’s numbers many get COVID piss poor protection. Honestly we’re hell infection control nurses. told one infection nurse hospital program sucked said Admin says, said don’t. standing advocate staff. I’m sorry! could kick ass would!! I’m sure besides local ones know one else allowed inside unless OB patient. Even better killing dumb. Let Darwin job    free. paid already. Like pay recycling plastic bottle.

Tell em part purchase goes getting AOC kicked office something else similarly absurd. wife navy would died country shes navy respiratory therapist sign die you… done giving “@&amp;$) point ….as husband worried mental health. 

Good luck yall. Get vaccinated good luck Why? vaccines (except Sputnik think) approval. headline misleading. makes seem like means 100 8,000 MA, really means 100 4 million. stupid. friends started isolating delta fears

Is life  Louisiana's biggest hospital turning away heart attack victims, car crash victims, etc have. No. Room. ICU beds full unvaccinated covid patients. can't imagine family member someone gets turned away ER dumbf*ck antivaxxers get beds. Infuriating.  Sorry hear it’s taking long you. Hopefully gets fixed soon.

I pretty sure Walgreens fault case. profile full mistakes surprised info sent state mistakes well. somewhere 5 8 weeks optimal based upon UK info? It’s sad it’s political game Florida Texas. shouldn’t popularity contest instead based pure numbers.

Right now, choices poor. me, I’d delay school opening weeks faster spread also means burn/travel trough population quicker. I’d rather start school month late sane numbers vs throwing fuel fire.

Slight cough, congestion, headache, pink eye, fatigue. put toddler coughing sneezing directly face, I'd assume high viral dose.  rare good news week. attitude like that, won't!  incubation period 5-14 days, there's particular reason covid get less deadly. virus already successfully reproduced infected many new hosts first people die. There's much environmental pressure virus get less deadly. Influential powerful blocs like USA EU need step things ensuring country left behind. relative monopoly vaccine production supply many parts world burning.

A massive global effort needed hope containing suppressing virus many variants.

What's point countries reaching 80% + immunity others delighted could ever reach 10%. family Jonesboro they've recently started see *slight* increase mask use stores. Maybe 25%, 15% weeks ago. They're still seeing much change attitude toward vaccine within social circle :( know one work.. delivered news two figured heroes hospitals resources have. need triage screen, give care people gotten vaccine first. Period. I'm even angry. 

I'm sad level I've never experienced before. work one would force us shut half cnas nurses vaccinate. shut would hell lots disabled people simply get cared for. would several deaths skin infections, medications missed, overall neglect. survive transition would end situation elsewhere. entire system would collapse. much hate admit we're stuck idiots. I’m going one island cases aren’t exploding (Kauai) I’m little paranoid lol It’s honestly really impressive given size US.

I think we've access vaccines long. federal government threw bunch money vaccine manufacturers even clinical trials finished would vaccines ready ship minute FDA gave emergency approvals. lots access problems initially due piecemeal, state-by-state rollouts; state left devices going administer vaccines groups people would get priority (e.g. medical workers people certain age groups).

My state (Washington) open access adults early April, friends relatives states got vaccinated January March. got vaccine mid-April local medical services chain waiting list couple weeks. couple friends live rural area got vaccinated couple weeks rest us S'Klallam Tribe (which getting vaccine supplies via federal Indian Health Service) gotten many members vaccinated quickly opened vaccine clinic non-tribal neighbors.

The pubic health system US really set mass vaccinations adults. example want annual flu shot, may get family doctor many people would go chain pharmacy (CVS, Walgreens, etc) grocery store phamacy (Wal-Mart, Safeway, etc). get COVID vaccines places least state April May.

So distribution smooth orderly got chaos way several months ago. :) Dude, guy talking never suggested either one. making damn joke. Vaccinated people skew older vulnerable compared overall population, people symptomatic breakthrough cases likely skew way even so. 1.25% good light that. important remember overall CFR place dragged every kid young adult gets infected virtually mortality risk. I’m this, here’s problem; city level, needs county level, OC needs get board well. Further, LA county’s sheriff won’t enforce mask mandate currently place doubt he’ll job enforce vaccine mandate either. mean, people died full vaccination Moderna Pfizer - it’s 100% perfect Stop watching *ER*. later seasons jumped shark anyway. lies. manufactured.  cases serious post-Pfizer Delta infection know of? vaccines reduce chances catching covid serious case do, yes.

But again, stat highly misleading protection stat things vaccines. small percentage unvaccinated people died since start vaccinations, too. I’m fully vaxxed ready come see America. 

Just… maybe quite yet. know kids temps 108. 108!!!!!! nope, put mask dangerous /s FWIW, delta already island spreading faster point pandemic. going tip island get sick there. Booster shot clinical trials? Kids fine It’s 1 80 breakthrough cases registered, far smaller sample actual number breakthrough cases.

Fauci lot interviews, asked lot different questions whose answers spun various narratives.

He's nonetheless consistent speaking directly odds break-through infections... 1% vaxxed get breakthrough infections... that's way better percent people get infections without vaccine.

As may possible; seems Delta transmissible deadly, so, possible future strains same. Also, future strain able avoid vaccine previous infection based immune responses, may deadly simply virtue new.

I idea guys much compassion anymore. want send every single antivaxxer waiver insurance healthcare let go merry way. Post Facebook! hero idiot friends! **not** come crying us breathing hard. imagine US would reasonable allowing vaccines approach. Possible, guess, unlikely. Think flood, still sticks low land takes easy path. get high ground (reduce contact) avoid Back then, people probably didn’t imagine hundreds millions would get infected hasn’t happened anyone’s lifetime. It’s raw numbers infections drives new variants virus like Covid. 

A photocopier good analogy. make copy copy copy, eventually result look different original. bad photocopier, happen faster good photocopier. Covid good photocopier, it’s perfect eventually get mutations impact. 

Looking glass half full, could far worse.  anybody looking abstract: exactly BioNTech went Pfizer knew needed resources get produced &amp; distributed quickly. What’s percentage death rate unvaccinated people get Delta? Ok fair. degrees bullshit DO's bad others. I'm similar boat - state decent (not amazing we're 12th last time checked percentage population that's fully vaxxed) county/city ahead rest state, majority people local area age 12 fully vaccinated. fiancee fully vaccinated, kids, friends live near us childless, fully vaccinated, immunocompromised, playing safe pandemic. 

I put mask go store public indoor spaces still (although longer currently mandated area) - never know might immunocompromised young kids home - nobody deserves risk lives lives families going store working there. we're hanging friends we'll outdoor dining restaurants/bars hangout someone's house indoors mask-less, something solid 13 14 months.

However, think everyone big injustice purporting D.O.s level chiropractors, naturopaths bologna practitioners. assume they'll go round 2 year? Headlines like don’t deserve get clicks. Fear-mongering downplaying vaccines effectiveness doesn’t provide value anyone. know what, people chose get vaccine (not including real medical reasons) bottom priority list. used follow Dr. Mercola. decade ago, advocated eating healthy vitamin diet rich fruits vegetables, lean meats, etc. would recommend supplements fish oil, suggest brands reputable. 

Then something changed, started selling brand products, products good (and far expensive available elsewhere). Later shifted keto train without calling … fat fuel, advocated eating weird diet mainly fats. Something changed, balanced advice gone Mercola started spewing quackery remedies. That’s tuned out. I'm personally favor blanket mandate, still apply vaccine emergency authorization?

If interested so, could find evidence vaccinated people dying far lower rates unvaccinated people.

The mutation process vaccinated unvaccinated. one difference mutation vaccinated person likely better breakthrough. 

My point vaccinated people get breakthrough infection less unvaccinated people get infection.

I could show evidence that, suspect actually want see it. ""Show evidence"" usually means ""my position unshakable"".

Yeah, I'll wait medical consensus.  New iPhone comes october march study iPhone works 6 months wont scared gonna break 7 you? tell cursory googling it, seems delay second dose. 

It’s speculated/reported delaying second dose may beneficial. 

Of course want full immunity asap, it’s best delay (basically stick vaccines recommended schedule). 

You protection regardless. 

The higher mRNA load doesn’t seem correlate much delay 2nd dose (but can’t find lot sources 30 seconds googling, take large Reddit sized grain salt). Oh FFS. topic, idea problem could shoot would get ground US (much less *south*) ridiculously implausible. unfortunately breakthrough covid case (was vaccinated Pfizer). first symptom Thursday, July 29th. research long people test positive they've vaccinated? doctor course says test 90 days travel August 21st requires negative PCR wondering likelihood working (Vs. cancel).

Fuck Pete, hope eats bad taco meat shits can't walk anymore. Pfizer gobs money, staff, data sources (like Israel), research divisions trials.

I got second dose may, even close six months yet. later year, get third dose. fully expect USA board rest world boosters already. understand vaccinated person probably severe? generally accepted means withholding care either  Perhaps saw promise work?

What would do? hard work give someone else profit from? already know Pfizer performs. Hoping Moderna better means would people protected Pfizer. Different bodies react differently. Anecdotally, COVID makes side effects 1st shot worse. reason statistical. given individual chance, happens US chance arising US lower vs rest world. sure think effective argument. Everyone already agrees need push hard get whole world vaccinated.

I guess I'm calling OP liar. I'm also assuming JHU data accurate. likely there's delay/disconnect two (without malicious intent) 

It's weird people critical data/information goes beliefs soon someone chimes asking proof/data/sources something supports beliefs, downvoted like bad person daring question ask sort proof aside single anecdotal story. 

Heck, nothing else could point change/learning opportunity (ie *improvement*) identify/rectify discrepancies *actually* happening hospital vs. reported. Regardless outcome is, we're better getting straight pushing consistent, accurate, transparent, toughough data. many alternatives also affordable us :/ vaccines haven’t offered sterilizing immunity disease (HPV may acception).

An N95 10% inward leakage gives 150 minutes infectious dose. 

A surgical mask gives 30 minutes protection comparison.  great vaccine preventing serious disease. even better supplement mRNA vaccine dose. Personally single shot J&amp;J would get dose moderna pfizer worry much. still well protected serious disease. dose mRNA vaccine likely decrease odds getting symptomatic infection may worth considering. need pop wallgreens.  can't find study two academic articles referring points it. wrong details, 400 participants 60 yo over.

Did miss study UK month ago showing thing? study remember correctly showed average person gets Delta specifically hospitalized, loses IQ points cognitive decline equal average stroke patient. someone Delta needs intubated, double cognitive decline seen average stroke patient.

I still can't find information specifically regarding breakthrough cases vaccinated people, disagree mild cases mean low viral load therefore risk long-term effects. proven untrue.

You need expert understand biology. Johnson Johnson? Hey - first off, sorry hear father. - fortunately... unfortunately(?) COVID. dad battled cancer 12 years ago, passed 2019 complications. Honestly sure would made pandemic, kinda bittersweet.

My cousin's grandmother going last bouts chemo last year - us vaccinated. They'd often go visit and, even outside, remain full 6 feet masks on. Knowing know now, think staying different house hotel room, visiting father staying **outside** would literally safest thing do. 

Having gone shoot shortly getting vaxxed, required take PCR test. came back negative. shoot 2 days, I'm told went another day, would required take rapid test set. Anecdotally, maybe that's move. Take PCR test seeing father, get rapid test done every 2-3 days.

Felony disenfranchisement pretty problematic though, since wading politics, that's much I'm going say particular matter.  really set max capacity unvaccinated patients. Leave room normal er issues people right thing got anyways. Six months starting run many us though ...  99% TESTED cases. many vaccinated people walking around asymptomatic, still spreading dont think need wear masks social distance. Like vaccine gives protective bubble. learned Delta doesnt care vaccine comes contagious community spread. Correlation causation end vaccines protect getting unless boosters every year seems like bad idea generally many reasons.

In end thing matters long term severe disease. 

The Oxford vaccine actually best technology provides best t-cell response. Pfizer though, fairly happy least somewhat protected long term.  Rabies insane virus. sure automod removed comment incivil. I'll post again

I'm anti-quackery know D.O.s anything but. used way stereotype persists. Yeah makes happy knowing strong response too. vaccinated doesnt give everyone got vaccine please. adjust behaviour virus changes, vaccinated people following recommendations guidelines virus mutates, bad unvaccinated comes controlling monster. happens hospitals take slack government, government see reason helpful hospitals.

And also said cloth masks paper surgical masks barely anything stop slow spread covid, everyone would need wear N95 better that’s also happening. think trapped conservative culture bubble downplayed virus big deal, totally fine business usual.

So maybe didn’t feel strongly anything, virus *clearly* nothing worry about, getting vaccinated something prioritize (and wait bit longer, data come safer gen 2 vaccine released).   problem line thinking virus runs rampant within unvaccinated population, there's always chance virus mutate something defeat vaccine.

There's new COVID variant, Lambda, shown study (although yet peer-reviewed) vaccine resistant variants.

Myocarditis? variant contagious snd kids getting seriously impacting kids? Both? Correct risks hospitalized far greater unvaccinated. That’s big risk healthcare industry (a lot insurance isn’t cross-borders). 

Additionally research indicates viral load lower vaccinated breakthrough case making less likely infect someone else.

The R value non vaccinated 6 (meaning spread rona 6 people average). haven’t seen R breakthrough cases vaccinated individuals it’s lower. Even might good idea, there'd near-instant lawsuit next-day injunction federal court another. CBD gummies?

I’m sorry happened.  ""But vaccinated people, replication soon alerts immune system send blood-borne antibodies neutralize virus nose throat, Leal says. Another new preprint scientists Singapore found although vaccinated unvaccinated patients infected Delta similar viral loads diagnosed, loads declined rapidly vaccinated. “Based basic immunology, that’s exactly would expect—that vaccinated individuals would clear infection much faster,” says Kristian Andersen, infectious disease researcher Scripps Research.""

Yes, is. vaccine resisted, antibodies vaccine raised vaccinated (by affinity maturation) resisted, humans genetically similar, tend arrive sets antibodies. variant lucks mutation(s) negates antibodies, *is* positive selection favor escape. 

That said, booster *of offending variant* answer, prompts immune system fight off, previously raised antibodies cut (not good enough binding affinity), go back affinity maturation generate antibodies *do* bind well enough fight off.

My facebook feed full people shrieking Fauci shill plant works pharma due things said reasonable especially face information had, yet 100% proven massive scale controlled studies. 

Shutdowns major impacts massive blowback. one mean think should. Especially know ineffective people flaunt guess I'm really issue then, unless know Fauci government...

I know Fuaci, hamstrung spotlight full every exact word.  guy got beat pretty hard there's millions folks figurative crosshairs (and maybe literal ones) waiting anything catch on.

Science now... well science different story. Science tells us Delta Variant infecting vaccinated people high viral load probably contagious. 

The higher viral load people infected chances really dangers mutation. 

We pretty lucky Delta got contagious less lethal (although lethality thing worry about, fried got done week breakthrough COVID lost sense smell taste) could easily mutate lethal. 

So Fauci Government say do? think pretty obvious treacherous grounds navigate. 

Science telling us anything, that's science does. Science giving us information information points pretty clear picture least good reason (if necessarily overwhelming reason) practice abundance caution. 

The problem really pull shut horse gate. Basically COVID mutates something even dangerous measurable impact argue shutdown. matter painfully obvious taking big risk happening, there's way society going accept another shut risk actually goes wrong. 

And gets Ebola levels bad, kind thing going long that's going really meaningful impact big picture. sure? physical could start working local hospital. Walgreens today...lol don’t understand. Israel expect different outcome % hospitalized UK? similar vaccination rates, Israel exclusively used vaccine demonstrably efficient vs Delta. 

Also, hospitalization rate high rising, number people ICU isn’t rising nearly fast. Could simply hospitalizing ”mild” severe cases before? Kids hospitalized increased numbers started essentially zero. Deaths among kids haven’t increased all. rich people still send kids school. numbers close giving bad risk profile. kids without leukemia school. Almost 72% taken first shot total population, guess safe say antivaxxers smaller problem many countries, course you’d want even people vaccinated. stop dying, stop majority dying, fucking money.

SYDNEY — Australia's second-most-populous city, Melbourne, entered sixth coronavirus lockdown Thursday Victoria state officials detected ""multiple mystery cases"" suspect highly contagious delta variant.

The week-long lockdown comes day state reported first 24 hours without new infection nearly month, briefly raising hopes recent battle delta variant behind it.

Officials announced eight new infections Thursday, linked previous cases. Victoria Premier Daniel Andrews told reporters mystery cases still investigation snap lockdown way prevent outbreak spiraling control.

“Because thing moves fast, it’s either lock . . . runs wild gets away pulling back,” said delta variant.

Australia’s closed international border, rigorous contact tracing snap lockdowns made covid success story, 35,000 cases total 932 deaths. country struggled suppress outbreaks delta variant. sluggish vaccination program left population roughly 25 million vulnerable.

Andrews said wanted avoid larger outbreak like one Sydney, health officials reported record 262 new cases five deaths Thursday.

“We don’t want happen here,” said Sydney’s outbreak, began June averaging 200 new cases day recently. “We’ve already, worse.”

Melbourne went one world’s longest lockdowns last year. Cases peaked 700 day, city 5 million remained shuttered almost four months.

Its recent lockdown, sparked infectious furniture movers Sydney, lasted 12 days ended last week.

Andrews said unclear new mystery cases linked outbreak.

The lockdown began statewide Thursday evening. Victorians able leave home food essential supplies, care caregiving, authorized work education cannot done home, exercise, get vaccinated.

Australia’s third-largest city, Brisbane, also lockdown suffering cluster delta cases.

The shutdowns threaten send Australia second pandemic recession, Sydney’s lockdown alone costing around $750 million per week. officials say cannot lift restrictions cases drop inoculations increase without unleashing wave covid cases, hospitalizations deaths.

The country ramped vaccination program recent weeks supply issues improved, 20 percent eligible adults received two doses.

Andrews said country’s sluggish vaccination rate partly blame lockdown.

“To frank, don’t enough people vaccinated,” said, “so option available.”

Andrews criticized counterpart Sydney, New South Wales Premier Gladys Berejiklian, waiting week put state lockdown June.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison initially praised Berejiklian recently reversed course, arguing snap lockdowns way deal delta outbreaks.

Last week, prime minister unveiled road map pandemic lockdowns become much less frequent nation fully vaccinates 70 percent people 16, figure said Australia reach year’s end.

Andrews, gained fame marathon daily news conferences last year’s lockdown, struck note weary resolve announcing unwelcome sequel Thursday.

“They incredibly painful, incredibly difficult,” said lockdowns. “The alternative locked seven days, it’s locked seven weeks more, locked get 80 percent vaccination. may happen almost Christmastime.” Next week Joe Rogan Experience... many levels stupid going evolve ? first graders going need declare political party , decide wearing mask not. wear fucking mask feel one bit sorry them. medical type tell wouldn’t vaccinate civilians smallpox now; effective treatments it.

Personally, I’d rather vaccine; I’m old enough it, idea effective now. I’d probably need booster. Lamda identified December 2020. Pfizer Moderna effective it. Chinese vaccines less so. Research suggests dangerous Delta. I'm waiting holographic Moderna know Delta spread among vaccinated people

All variants spread vaccinated people bub. small N studies proven selective - show vaccine real working effectively before.

This change unvaccinated people (especially children) - safe.

Moderna literally showed 93% efficacy 6m today. Please. UBI and/or stimulus checks solution. god forbid help support working class way. Financial support strictly billionaires only. yes. titers done Hep B got job hospital even though shots young (and records) didn’t pick Hep B test. get shot again. Yes, people get vaccinated, lower probability variant.  headache iirc. That's it! easy solution. COVID patients enter hospital unvaccinated people state.

40% covidiots? get access 40% hospital single extra bed.

They don’t like this? go get vaccine.

This fair. reason 40% people occupy 100% hospital idiots shouldn’t face consequences actions 

Being adult hard, yeah… Put inside Hi may silly, I'm actually scared medical effects getting vaccinated, know I'm silly am. stay inside covid lower risk infection wear mask necessary full submission like would help me, many others feel safer. preparing book appointment moderna now, please hate people genuinely nervous politicization vaccinated late February

In case anyone wondering defining early vs late vaccinees. Another example ""the exception proves rule."" Like saying Bill Gates get degree he's super wealthy!

Yeah, sure, plan. plan drop art school bum around South America going lead wealth, son. business source disease spread really call call health department.

This restaurants (which private businesses) still adhere regulations regular inspections. really depends person. could India prevented it? old white lady. fully get mortality. got pfizer second shot put ass day. thought long Covid symptoms sounded similar EBV. mono 20 years ago still deal fatigue brain fog. Definitely haven’t person energy-wise since infected. posts many COVID19-related papers. reminder: formally peer-reviewed guide health-related behavior reported press conclusive. Archive.org:  Another stimulus check, please! job got vaccinated  It’s infection Colleges universities disaster waiting happen. People 18-24 range among least likely vaccinated also huge vectors spread given social mobile: Delta variant currently symptomatic effect vaccinated. Anyways enjoy bi annually boosters buddy! know person answered, since lots relatives Texas, guarantee personally know tons people either deny covid big deal and/or refuse get vaccinated. spent 10 days hospital covid last November. worst, using 55 liters oxygen. high glow cannula went 65 liters, headed ventilator. Thankfully, plasma transfusion, remdesivir, steroids, blood thinners worked pull back. literally hospital one uncles Texas trying question really covid saying bad. delusion runs strong deep texans. uncle whole family still vaccinate. harmed personally think need it. kept bringing visited summer (I knew felt intransigent going bring up) got upset refused stop pointing making choice also others choice could kill someone else. Whatever. kind going this. plenty ""booster"" shots available think prudent get one. easy see boosters might good ""public health"" large still beneficial individual. Finally Nice. Maybe Florida boost pediatric caseload weeks shoves kids classroom sans masks per state law. 

Unbelievable.

I hope everyone knows people Florida shocked horrified people live smarter kinder places. Lamda identified December 2020. Pfizer Moderna effective it. Chinese vaccines less so. Research suggests dangerous Delta. coworker similar he’s bound catch covid bed least days. I’m tempted say won’t cover workload case. didn’t know laziness contagious covid 19. Thanks education, guess. /s sure much helps study found uses fitbit / apple tracking data shows previously infected people get vaccinated recovering show noticeably stronger response 1st dose rest group much smaller variance tracking data 1st dose (resting heart rate / steps taken) can't wait Zulu-Zulu variant. Could good time buy used Harley month two. Everything reason question FDA. wasnt delta variant around 1st vaccine wave? delta variant cases india last year? people viral loads restricted nasal throat areas, lungs. According dude NPR read article. also looked risk GBS, least great virus Pfizer vaccine. also mRNA vaccines correlations. 

In order *not* dunk argument ignore fact he's trying protect GBS putting considerably greater risk it. absolute fact that, like nearly vaccine hesitancy, well-informed rational stance. White house documents show 40 percent infection rate 99 percent masking. assume looking 80 90 percent infection rate otherwise.  tool disposal could prevent 98% this. North Korean propaganda  Surges temporary care immunocompromised unvaccinated children. wait weeks going bars. Plenty beer home. surprising isn’t uneducated. literally saw profile fb yesterday 28 July shared video tiktok said chance getting COVID dying super slime there’s nothing worry about. Miami, ICU, refused intubation lying face 16hours day. side Mexican, I’m 30f still waiting second jab, choose get it. 🙄 white privilege man, gotten away much even think outlive science. humoral immunity, also explains second shot worse people.

Basically, memory cells immune response taking small part antigen presented with, holding time. way, body presented antigen again, fight back much quicker, aggressively.

So recently exposed covid, get first vaccine immune system rapid aggressive response disable foreign antigens presented with. However, first exposure first vaccine, won’t build memory cells immune system, see aggressive immune response next exposure (second dose) Raise hand feel sympathy lady? 🖐 Yeah people live polluted areas cities people take vitamins every day. Also anyone come contact yards treated Roundup people live sunny climates. Also mass shooting victims obviously brought lived somewhere lunatics easy access guns lol /s I'm assuming good amount people completely anti-vaxx fair share hesitancy gave every excuse get it. people probably thought enough people got could get without getting thus get it. Chances saw people getting vaxx'd, infection rates going summer, got complacent thinking need get long enough people got it.

Now rapidly Delta spreading breakthrough cases probably tipped scale people. Obviously breakthrough infections still rare grand scheme things especially serious breakthrough infections think people realized can't rely others getting vaxx'd keep safe. need part protect thats think vaxx rates rising. Especially unvaccinated kids wearing masks. need offer incentive ""travelers"" definitely get extra staff bonus right That's strange, according de santis Joseph Goebbels covid mathematics, everything dandy. may call shortages, him, sounds like hospital business booming. adults. drive 100mph highway, face consequences. pay fine even end jail. endangering others!

Guess what. It’s exactly unvaccinated people doing.

It here. Don’t want vaccine? Well, okay, get sick, you’re own.

And fall fallacy comparing people smoke get lung cancer:
- stopping hard. Getting vaccine trivial 
- cannot prove link someone’s cancer smoking non smokers get cancer too. Whereas 1:1 direct link getting vaccine getting covid

Another fallacy “tHiS SLiPPerY sLoPe”. Well everything slippery slope including drinking glass water. drink much die, yet essential bit. here. check CDC’s stats getting vaccinated. makes glad well. neighbors far away. well 300 feet. still. ick. need catch cases. thought point make another cold, completely eradicate. 

If someone COVID asymptomatic low viral load contagious, purposes discussion, cares? ""sick,"" importantly, spreading virus. Fair, that's meant, private business, private decision? people deciding whether want business companies enforce vaccine passports. yeah based time might least 6 months understand decision. leaders' point view, duty citizens. Big brain. Still hundred million times getting covid.  93% effective infection severity? I’d shocked infection. finished 2nd dose january 21st moderna, tested positive covid yesterday 102 fever numbers, .05% death rate?

That almost additional 2 , 0 0 0, 0 0 0 deaths..thats 2 million people need die. FairPlay

*UK think wait see needed asked for. Dosages vaccines might change. prefer become glowworm pin cushion. Missississippi would like word you. Mexico? mean southern Alabama? That's real problem! title misleading. Nobody charged insurance unvaccinated far know would illegal so. 

People paying health care even insurance, care isn’t free, unvaccinated makes likely need health care. asked get vaccine already sick enough hospitalized? Maybe people ignorant vaccines don’t work like medication. vaccine isn’t like antibiotic. don’t understand. Unless government plans implementing form universal basic income see schools open. Maybe. Possibly. Could be.

What change given COVID likely endemic decades now?

Influenza both. specter change behavior? No? COVID? Probably, know, directly result slow passage time? research long-term effects short-term timeframe lol Besides unvaccinated opened states removed mask mandates soon 20% states vaccinated. read vaccine available states told WAIT states 60%-70% vaccinated reopening removing mask mandates. Either children fully vaccinated, person school going ugly fast Everyone make decision, understand listen CDC, bother CDC stopped collecting breakthrough data people contract covid aren’t hospitalized? 

Personally, I’m looking countries (legitimate) organizations data make completely informed decision booster. don’t trust CDC much used to, don’t get sole source anymore, me. “This variant going spare one,” scientist/physician said. “If unvaccinated, almost surely going encounter virus close personal. us -- us vaccinated, we're going encounter vaccinated person likely get infected.""

Get shots people That’s 1 per 100,000 unvaccinated people. there’s 200 confirmed infections per 100,000 unvaccinated people. So, 1 200 die. considering contract illness minor enough symptoms confirmed, number likely less 1 200. it’s also true 200 could still early stages infection. let go little longer, could get another death two. 

So far we’re seeing increase hospitalizations among younger ages. makes sense old largely vaccinated. one seems bit transmissible virulent among kids. still nothing like happened old people last year. People outside US also access Internet. Oh really, yes really. I’ve go many times people similar acting like you’re saying concrete twisting words around. It’s whether virus anything stop spread it’s it’s substantial enough make difference. Literally last article sent talks discouraging lol really got good stuff there. 

We don’t know easily people still passing virus vaccine, top they’re already telling people get third vaccine. you’re smart know exactly you’re talking right? bet haven’t willing admit don’t know throughout whole pandemic got expert knowledge

No shit cases popping unvaccinated. vaccine shown help people get sick proven true. however shown help herd immunity numbers actually stopping spread all. Let ask this, got vaccine picked virus didn’t notice virus didn’t feel ill slight cold would go get tested? Let’s pretend you’re one people fanatic decide go get tested. know many people going get tested already vaccine? reason many positive tests popping Southern states versus places like Vermont it’s people getting sick don’t vaccine. nothing whether spread virus stopped not, top new Delta variant makes things even complicated. know everything you’re talking right? wait little longer tides turn people determined vaccine handed every man woman child age three confirm. company's CEO, build company mind you, decides sell competitor. retires. could retire, get new CEO move on. Nope, takes quick windfall large number company probably let go due redundant systems. even vaccine passport? hope implemented fair manner something like something something iPhone app , Andorid verison expect Q3 2031. 
I nothing getting vaccine, opposed requiring vaccine, going go proving it? 
Schools, jobs, military process submitting medical documentation, something different. Zero changes, zero side effects. Pfizer back Spring. true, think explanation infecting younger people higher rate (keyword there) rate young people vaccinated vs. older people vaccinated much lower. 

If numerator people infected, denominator going people infected, denominator made disproportionately younger people. know ask good thing people consider. family extended family trusted bubble. Everyone else outside bubble.

My mom turns 79 weekend. party her. Everyone vaccinated, 14 guests, doors. anyone go house, use bathroom A/C, wear mask.

Some work bigger bubble family extended family since know preventative are, thems rules.  guess Delta missed memo since care vaccinated all. I’ve covid first shot hit hard. Second shot wasn’t near bad, mostly tired. Jesus, comment hit hard. veteran, exactly they’ve service members since 9/11.

For folks medical field dealing shit, nothing ultimate respect, especially eligible vaxxed got it. Much respect. smoke ashish Set folding lawn chair outside vitamin immune system things. Vaccines openly available free countless venues since march. March. 5 months. finding similar viral loads asymptomatic people

LA county already QR codes set up. business patron refuses follow rules, LAPD would called upon enforce rules, probably would. 

What I’m saying enacted county level, probably also enacted county level OC, it’s basically one big ass metropolis anyways. problem enacting county level comes enforcement. business patron inevitably tries flaunt rules, enforcement would left LASD anyplace outside LA city city doesn’t PD. LASD covers significant portion county sheriff already refuses enforce mask mandate currently place, he’d likely also refuse enforce vaccination mandate.

In short, city LA enact would nice, leaves large part SoCal population mandate. need county level, enforcement would likely problem.  escape chan someone forget lock think 7 year old would fine.

Yeah that’s general sentiment- *I* didn’t leave part out, got lost messaging somehow. vacccines rolled large public gatherings back agenda, CDC said masks (“for vaccinated”, let’s honest- one ever going check CDC didn’t know they’re even remotely qualified job), general messaging “covid you’re vaccinated”. “they’re trying bring back” (it never left), people rightfully disregarding lot news favor delusion we’re back normal que será será unvaxed. say mistake, unfortunately poor communication, knowing media seems operate… kinda feel like rich done anyone boss around made decision us. hunch related synergistic effects CBD melatonin other.

I also know people died mostly 50. One person though neighbour hospital said sister severe astma underlying disease reason. sister claims astma all. found sketchy. admit already trust every single young person suddenly already sick happen die based that. 

But also know people got covid notice anything. wife one them. Also strange situation works home order groceries. daughter went school got sick went work. daughter tested negative. wife positive tested negative. wife one positive even said hello neighbour passed two weeks. asked second opinion refused. 5 days needed tested still everybody negative. Weirdly enough wife need test even insist refused. doubt actually it. problem get second vaccine tested positive once. called according government get second one anyway want seem finally gave up. countries starting third vaccination still want second shot her. 

And yes case you, anecdotal. Vaccine seller: need vaccines

no shit It’s crazy know many people got mRNA none complained side effects. reddit seems standard.  people study spread information, far reaches, long takes reach critical point. I'm positive they've worked 48 hours returns content diminishing, deleting little hinder agenda. time, enough people seen it, read it, shared it, taken responsibility spreading others. 

It's painfully ironic misinformation around virus behaves almost identical virus itself, yet people spreading unaware damage causing; intellectually asymptomatic. 

Until, like things people, personally affected, comes regret.  Tree Change Dolls handpainted. Barbies need designed mass production, hard lot details. Definitely getting vaccinated. spent entire day test riding around wife getting senior pictures made realizes much exposed entire house this, particular Mom. Thank J&amp;J task wife’s case ( still knocking wood still past clear point daughter ). 

All said daughters case Round Two seems far milder far. hoping cutting infectiousness aren’t relying it. She’s banished room part let outside times. main symptom time seems lethargy atypical characteristic normally. unite evil within nation Supporting Germany WW2! Talk wrong side history. Hard explain one later. would surprised wasn’t higher. Pro rate U.K. Delta peak would 300k. 

Since US significant lower vaccination, might guess would higher, perhaps much higher.  Respect acknowledging bro. Sweet, sweet justice. fantastic news. different smokers paying shitty life decisions habits. That's wondering about, Moderna release link back paper CI anyway moot point now. Oh well. need boosters yet. point they're basically using children giant petri dish cultivate virus. already owned pulse ox we've keeping tabs we're stayed 97.

Yeah believe ""severe"" symptoms oxygen getting abnormally low, since 97+. vaccine working!! :) We've two shots, yes.

But booster shot? dolls still need expressive appealing children. since faces small, need designed mass production, hard lot subtle details still keeping appealing. variation, examining dolls close really tell. never going end. articles coming saying kids catching COVID hospitalized, idiots protesting mask mandates. can’t parents, must paid actors. openly spreading high amount, also lead variants, though. Absolutely. isn’t “disagreement politics” longer. Things polarized revealed stark differences fundamental ideology don’t see marriages even friendships really survive. considering driving 8+ hours round trip Bakersfield get 2 weeks earlier age group opened nearby.

Only reason way could guarantee run vaccines making 4 hour trip there.  Yeah, doesn’t work. father stayed inside entire year, got vaccines, continued wear masks despite mandate lifted, spent time vaccinated individuals. extremely short amount time proximity random unvaccinated individual class, contracted COVID. symptoms. 

Unvaccinated people’s actions affecting us won’t change stop allowing unvaxxed people work public spaces interact public. Citation?  Get shot least twice year still get sick sometimes. Eventually enough variants co-infect start getting sick multiple strains once. gonna blast.  
 
PS. mad anti-vaccers. Even got 100% vaccination US, countries wild animals. would always come back. Eradication never menu. works far. live NY mandates we're decently serious nothing crazy school kids wore masks last year. job nicer neighborhood homeowners kids came home 3 masks. get bus take masks immediately group 20 unmasked kids gather front lawn slowly filing house go play basement. Made laugh irony, people masked around school going home playing unmasked dirty kid That's good hear. TBH, I'm genuinely surprised 70% adults US least one shot. I'm sure help you, find laying immensely helpful drawing blood getting shots. ask place, gladly accommodate you. look away close eyes. need worry keeping upright anything except lying there. eyes closed know going happen feel less prick does. really understand ""Is news fear mongering two heavily today?"" loaded way ask question that's definitely neutral prejudices people statements? cousin dealing doctor say long taste/smell improving means fully comeback don’t data source back up. got April said every weeks another food tastes better never read “among US” way Let's forget contagious illnesses. Viruses cause real damage, sometimes even minor ones. Extroverts pay insurance premiums result.

Everyone see shitty make this? I'm sure suggesting still US wide problem even certain states currently hit hardest ""purely political""! tragic. Fuck DeSantis COVID co-conspirators. even **some** protection, lot protection. People apparently crazy standards vaccines consider around 75% effective preventing infection 85-90% effective preventing symptomatic infection. **really** good numbers unlikely someone vaccine catch breakthrough, even possible. Thanks getting though! could shoot anyone gets within 20 feet prevent COVID, still taking south. kid zombie coming you, would shoot it? would incredibly hard opening days likely still hard worn awhile. Maybe cured, knows? Sometimes zombies movies look dead, sometimes look almost exactly like they're alive move differently.

There also different types zombies. 28 Days Later gets infected get drop blood system. sneeze would probably work they're fast. Walking Dead, everyone dies reason becomes zombie. Trying mouth-to-mouth asking bitten. People could heart attack sleep, would headshot anyone died reason.

You could definitely pockets people protected, confusion early days would likely wipe ton people. used think zombie movies unrealistic people would hide bite, attempt CPR, sleep room people sick. know 40% country would things emboldened told to.  admittedly paid taxes fund free

For intents purposes, free, like get tax money back decide get vaccine. suicidal? Good. Got offer people real way actually protect huge amount population around refuses vaccines masking. cannot believe society collectively decided immunocompromised people matter response pandemic. girlfriend got COVID like 5 weeks ago recovered smell taste, I'm honestly worried recover it; know people takes longer come back, actually taste couple weeks ago, I'm wondering, evidence long-term damage smell taste? second shot yesterday. feel good.

Delta considerably virulent - nearly 5 times many contract require oxygen, ICU admission die- save time reading document, relevant part:


""
Suspected Case

having epidemiological history criteria plus two clinical manifestations；
•
having three clinical manifestations clear epidemiological history.
●
""

**So considered suspected case need least 2 clinical manifestations according document**

""
Clinical manifestations：
◆
Fever and/or respiratory symptoms；
◆
Radiographic imaging consistent COVID-19 pneumonia；
◆
Normal decreased WBC count, normal decreased lymphocyte count early stages illness.
""

**Then says ""confirmed case"" need suspected case plus extra conditions (a positive PCR test something similar)**

Hence (at least early 2020 according document) could positive PCR symptoms confirmed suspected case. guess could still considered asymptomatic infected person (even though symptoms). Boomers took seriously, got vaccinated, mostly troubled waters now.

I let children environments vaccinated. sucks, missing fun amusement areas, like 20 kids, maybe 3 mask correctly. like we're MAH RIGHTS area. I'll often see parents wearing masks without kids wearing them, definitely much older 2.

At times past 2 years, seemed absolutely hopeless, simply give trying answer. opportunity take preventative action? deserve limited resources someone deserving, example, someone valid reason cannot get vaccination? I'm little cold-hearted. would straight triage: vaccine? Back fucking line. Lowest priority healthcare. Full quarantine. Vaccine, tested positive? Highest priority. 

Eat shitcake, antivaxxers. kind like working save life drunk driver caused accident. still person's fault there. That’s good point. Even then, though, far Republicans willing support work LBJ far Democrats working approving Nixon (until watergate ate presidency). 60s messy time, people weren’t set ideologically party “cheering” Maybe fix immune system. Covid even without vaccine weak af healthy people. compensates farmers vaccine costs. like vaccination free humans.

 analogy sucks, evidence paying vaccination US changes much. best friend ICU anesthesiologist. would tu age covid patients difficult docs. 

She walked away elective surgeries now. Exact reason—she able get crisis cause want way surge winter vaccines available, says she’s done giving crap patients dont care anyone. That’s massive overkill ""How sick patient Covid-19 indicator whether would experience cognitive decline.""

This care breakthrough cases dont make dead hospitalized.  Living faulty brain worse death.  article city/county requiring vaccine proof instead business deciding? Probably sooner think. kids US died COVID flu since beginning pandemic. Like, many, many times more.  I'm sorry. Thank trying. I'm talking zero chance it. course always chance.

My point know probability would rather able assess risk accurately rather finding hard way. 

And again, choice. make them. can't wait this... need shootings, random knife attacks. much different. That’s fair, there’s reason anecdotes don’t matter comes policy canceling large scale events. Right. impossible envision someone who'd want implement masks needed, someone could make changes policy based shifting data. Everything authoritarian that's how'd charge. fully vaccinate educator wife complete agreement you. local government gutless refuses anything would limit ""freedoms"" individuals. percentage infections raw numbers? 3 months, around 6 so... fail see anecdotal report family reunion relevant here? Side note: pictured Grand Central Market. Went multiple times town shoot once. Absolutely delightful highly recommend it. Moooovid19 describing private business deciding want business with.

What person replied problem government stepping telling private businesses must must business with. 

It's completely different idea. said last night “17 months shit.” That’s long deployment Iraq was. Veterans helped open covid ward. explained team needed pace focus careful. would long drawn year. Even soldiers get pulled front lines eventually. People breaking pressure. boot nursing school enrollment area abysmal. reinforcements. would help morale care sick people least vaccinated. least folks would empathy tried right thing part solution. Instead people high flow watching Fox News saying don’t virus family’s demanding change death certificates. country fucking joke. kid gets flu vaccine every fall...   Yeh also left international borders open Jan/Feb 2020 closing internal borders. Oh said racist banning travelers China subsequently. specific, talking synthetic ones (similar Synagis RSV). 

[Here’s article   alternatives, like staying friends hotel? interesting see Delta matches mortality rate previous waves.

How could ? Hydrochloroalquinine something like that? Regeneron?  normal town, maybe. town people brag trying deliberately infect other, I'll pass deliberately trying become breakthrough case. I've buried enough people claimed ""it's like flu"" already.  Andrew Cuomo August 5th

Wearing mask reduce chances child getting sick may reduce severity illness get sick. amount infectious viral exposure matters. virus getting bad. child 6 years old wears mask really well. took try outs different types find mask fit (no gaps) comfortable. found something works stuck type.

Meaning, remove someone life support die another use instead.

While seems hard do, harder try calculate resources future. Imagine one person shows today consumes resources 10 people. 2 weeks later, run out. never allocated resources. run out, let person die needlessly. discussions last year regarding use ECMO, consumes ton resources. worried we'd run gloves gowns ECMO patient would burn even quicker  Since robot could see veins skin, yes. Robots also wiggle damn needle you.  Yes I’m aware clue. problem solve Adult population big difference. OP, [severely overstating use OMT among 57% DOs don’t utilize practice all, number doubled since 2001. 21% utilize practice rare instances (5% less total patients); means around four five DOs don’t utilize practice meaningful way. fact, around 4% utilize practice half patients. Further, DOs utilize practice rare instances, don’t know aspects OMT utilizing—it could one OMT techniques shown minor therapeutic benefits lower-back manipulation.

I don’t know hung OMT. It’s something DOs learn never use. wouldn’t surprised done away soon, especially given MDs DOs share accreditation process. Osteopathic colleges medicine primarily pathways intelligent, qualified, non-traditional applicants able practice allopathic medicine given extreme competition MD programs among traditional pre-med students. OMT training DOs different military aviators undergoing firearms training; likely never use it, jump hoops know it. intubating ? can’t afford save idiots don’t want saved ffs Gets worse. county (in southern redneck Oregon)  we’ve family patients literally attack nurses. don’t like diagnosis COVID therefore get angry. Security guards escort out. 

Crazy there. know upgraded HVAC classrooms also requiring weekly testing everyone, blame you. daughter class 2020 I'm thanking god I'm face this. Hang there, hope works I'm nervous too! well vaccinated people still catch covid, test positive. much symptoms still add #s make look worse paralyzed &amp; sedated ventilator? remember it? cause pain off? agreed removed soon, curious much difference would made. Perhaps liberal areas. live, people were/are masking mandates. make difference. Ask folks vent that. type people open carry nieces birthday party, wear seat belt way there. sucks!

That’s .000009% children Florida keep perspective.  South Carolina too! racked guilt anxiety either option (home school)to honest. Can’t wait vote Joe Cunningham! hope government also same. mate 👍 CVS plenty appointments uses appointment finder app. There's case law restrictions them?

You need include risk getting covid19 (varies depending environmental community spread time) obviously less likely getting vaccine (100%) Treatment gets delayed every day hospital. Unless you’re trauma active code, you’re waiting ED get seen lot times. happens time, even people lot distress. still month unemployment benefits run out. side effects pretty much vast majority us experienced. know people severely effected, served 30 years thousands people got anthrax shots. mean understate impact anthrax vaccine people, including husband. safe would helped much weaponized anthrax attacked. add insult injury, VA refuses help effected. 5 11 years old. Coming fall. weeks, maybe months. mean PRC CDC variety different ways assesses cases suspected confirmed? document, ""confirmed case"" requires positive PCR test symptoms like fever dry cough. epidemiological connection lung imaging required. Exposure history relevant ""suspected cases"" (which makes sense).

I read quote way. Indeed says this

""Confirmed cases diagnosed based positive viral nucleic acid test results throat swab samples (some samples tested retrospectively).""

which says confirmed case positive test enough. means asymptomatic subset confirmed. particular say need symptoms confirmed case. 

In case criteria completely different ones linked before. Came say that. chose stupid make everything harder everybody (the population hate confined, hospital employees, patients couldn’t get hospital earlier took spot). Eff ! “I don’t want guinea pig,” said Renee Dunn, 43,

Our game 30 hour main story, 50 hours side content...

You know damn well 100%ing fucker 15 hours 🤣 Healthcare staff truly heroes. Front line worker. Wife got first dose Dec 24th. yeah, hopefully booster soon. Try telling patient walks screaming help gasping air. It’s easy refuse delay treatment. post wasn’t political though? stating situation church regarding covid vaccination. Soooo, designing fashion dolls takes work, thought, engineering lot people realize. can't think doll looks like naked, think looks like clothes on. fabric doll clothing proportionately thick doll. doll realistic body proportions, might look fine naked going look shapeless, lumpy, smothered clothes her. get look going for.

One area REALLY see neck. Fashion dolls usually long necks. proportionate neck, look fine naked low neckline, put something collar anything like looks like neck.

In addition, also design dolls they're easy dress play with. Little kids tiny fingers developing motor skills. fashion doll always thigh gap want put pants her! Shared clothes accessories also concern. bigger range body types means dolls need separate clothes, that's hard sell parents kids. goes accessories, fun play plus size Barbie can't fit car.

I know much face design I'm sure limitations there. know want face expressive. small Barbie faces are, hard subtle details.

And course, ultimately need appeal kids! Body positivity nice sentiment, can't sell toy (or product, really) values alone. still need appealing product. really think kids actually care realistic body face presentation, that's generally adult concern. Hell, kids polite PC sort thing, they'll tell think doll ugly, lol.

It's well, think dolls cause body insecurities beauty biases. best symptom, changing help anything overall societal attitudes remain same. kids think fat girls ugly, buy fat girl doll even try tell pretty. live work Georgia certain point EAMC called HR department ‘invited’ employees Auburn/Opelika get vaccinated since couldn’t get enough local residents take vaccines. don’t feel bad getting then. Fortunately Florida lot sand. Makes easier bury head it.  Ah, misread comment yours, notice people took compliance mandates. Never mind. soon young? pretty much known since March 2020 become endemic, neither options. Covid-19 simply characteristics make disease candidate eradication. easily transmissable, spreads asymptomatically, animal reservoirs. long shot completely sterilizing immunity maybe could done it, vaccines much better experts expected (and end pandemic), perfect vaccine never really cards. J&amp;J used cloned fetal cells host create intermediate virus. J&amp;J uses another virus (I think common cold) carry spike protein code, bred living cells. swap virus' normal payload spike protein code instead, easier grow viruses preferred host cell make own. *super* pro-life might consider avoiding one.

But means get Pfizer Moderna, effective anyways. 8 months fully vaccinated seriously considering popping Walgreens third dose. much smaller company. might 18 months ago quickly gaining ground Pfizer.

Sure terms employees Moderna 1,500ish Pfizer 78,500. Huge difference people power even Moderna expanding rapidly. (They ~830 employees March 2020) ok, mRNA weekend then. I’m betting tested enough kids throughout pandemic figure would somewhat lost amongst figures. feel people working wards sweating asses 16 hours Governor basically says 'don't worry make friends tinfoil brigade', must enfuriating!! seems like variants different enough, get reinfected. know effective previous infection building immunity unfortunately. I've read lot people talking experience getting reinfected. sure thorough studies it... got Pfizer nothing sore arm day. parents cousins got Moderna period maybe 12hrs post 2nd dose none could barely move incapacitated lol.  agree expectations high Delta variant didn’t emerge original variant.. would original expectations line? say disagreed spread coming from? point is, individual locales reporting 20-25% cases vaccinated people (Marin County, CA Lexington, KY addition L.A., top head), makes question 99% stat that's thrown around gospel. Mostly presented universal fact universal all. 

Los Angeles County 25% California's population always largest source cases state. 3,734 10,111 cases CA reported yesterday ours. think safe say 25% cases vaccinated people corroborating 99% unvaccinated case rate here. put last Sunday (got first dose!) scheduling ""sick days"" sort single mom (husband works away) tough. Juggling child care housework. timing right booster well. 

I also tend vaccine reactions, wanted make sure someone available 24hrs least call dime. I'm glad did, ended hives, got sick 48hrs. know does; mean Catholics still try get it. Like said, perfect. play devil's advocate bit though: society pay someone known heart condition heart attack refusing take meds, change diet, improve condition way? social contract give take. must empathy show mercy, people society cares must also put effort becoming healthy. Austin Texas, keeping city enforcing mandates. business getting government finding (like giant university system) allowed enforce masks, vaccines, even ask someone vaccinated. Nothing closed, events cancelled, one wear mask. mess. hospitals full spike continues. BioNTech produced Delta-specific vaccine start trials month.
But commenter wrote, third shot original vaccine seems trick fine.
Maybe using Moderna people vaccinated BioNTech/Pfizer vice versa could slightly effective. Thanks service far, yes. believe Moderna Pfizer testing variant-specific boosters, aren’t publicly available yet. Staff already fired getting vaccinated, it'll bad rest pick burden eventually quit overworked.

There already high turnover CNAs staff along doctor nurses shortage, exacerbated many colleges universities canceled classes clinicals last year half.  Welcome. looked up. love reddit know of. I've searching find anything data pfizer delta. Moderna delta data seems wraps. kinda concerning. possibility covid becoming seasonal endemic illness largely unavoidable moment virus got world-wide foothold. contain virus that's localized limited number cases specific area, eradicating virus exists worldwide really really hard. much cost? expect start handpainting Barbie dolls? Barbie never supposed “reality” This. scared scared change percent chance someone get symptoms mild, moderate severe. Masks symbol fear; they're simple preventative measure. God hate fear argument much. People unwise decision get want (natural selection) long don’t put hand mouth, chances getting Covid car extremely low. think made schools can’t mandate masks. Kids still wear them, can’t required wear one. actually surprised went meet teacher today half kids wearing them. thought would ones! mental exhausted combined dealing anti-vaxxers, anti-maskers fed empty lip service ""Thank you, essential workers! love you!""

I've known several people worked nurses walked out. take anymore worth life. vaccinated person I'm wearing masks places actually require wear mask, still go work everyday, j take trips different places weekends.

People stds , alcolism, smoking cigarettes need speak thats road take start  Yes. Yes, absolutely. already ask you’re smoker. exactly difference? (PS: say smoker) agree that's possible reading document. 

Can suggest way reading it? thing lot movies stories 

1) fast infection. think WWZ 13 seconds, many minutes less 

2) initial disbelief allows zombie hordes grow unmanageable size appropriate intervention 

 one case 3) complete worldwide infection, triggered death (the walking dead) one makes much realistic possibility. asymptomatic infection everywhere would mean horde coming every spot planet, simultaneously, growing exponentially, making nearly impossible bomb away, would many locations, collateral damage either lower net kill count even increase size horde. walking dead style plague would absolutely insane try stop. around world, would start making zombies 120 minute, increasing exponentially zombies create new ones. would figure every person dying producing zombie, bitten not, get information middle massive worldwide disaster, FAST. First wave zombies would reach 100,000 within first day outbreak.     Barnum statement.

The US may sooner later supervolcano eruption. Desantis took online option. Unless outlier, none friends teach two counties around us, online option classes. 

Florida Virtual school still option believe, fully online meaning kids never step classroom ever. 

I teach university also can't ask students mask vaccinate. Also big classes distancing. think it’s funny people raised Barbie think it’s benign like legos coloring books. mean I’m definitely anti video games, it’s kind like arguing Minecraft better GTA. Barbie puts weird unrealistic filter reality. I’m sure turned fine, it’s probably best toy buy kids. argue things done matter odd. puzzling everyone debating whether allow children gather schools without realizing happening *the entire time*, without lessons. numbers low, delta (which easy thing predict). Thx mane P r e c h. I'm hoping vaccine younger children soon. mean they’re kids unreasonable. remind five year old use toilet paper.  religious exceptions Maybe counties allowed switch states way college football teams change conferences. 100/4.2 million doesn’t make sense. 4.2 million haven’t infected wouldn’t infected even without vaccine.  misunderstanding link. March 2020 first case found, Hutchinson said travel outside state you’ll safe. It’s gone downhill there. 

I’m small NW Arkansas town. husband wife deliberately turn heads cough me, pretty much quit going out. didn’t like mask. 

If go WM grocery, mask wearing almost doubled—maybe 10% wearing masks now. 

I go bank today person wearing mask. None employees, none customers wearing masks. People stare. stare back turn away. 

Social distancing never thing here. Multiple neighbors consistently large groups over. Covid something catch strangers. neighbors covid, survived. 

I’m weird one who’ll holler people front door back 6 feet I’ll open door. 

Lots bonfires since May/June 2020. Often multiple day. I’m city limits. 

Covid something laughed about, taken seriously. It’s political issue, health issue. 

Only 36.58% Arkansans fully vaccinated. Less fifth 12-17 year olds vaccinated. Parental permission required minors. Surprise! Non-masking/non-vaccinating parents aren’t allowing kids get vaccinated. 

Look Governor Hutchinson’s town hall Siloam Springs Mountain Home you’ll understand cases high here. AR resident here. one cares. We’re vaccinated continue wear masks since children eligible age vaccine get weird looks heckled. Walmart pharmacies practically beg people get vaccine shop one isn’t vaccinated getting it. 

The piece covered frequently RSV, serious respiratory illness impacts young children, rise. Usually happens fall winter, really season. daycare multiple covid RSV cases past 3 weeks. Anyone kids terrified. someone explain safe? got J&amp;J March. still don’t fully understand whole blood clot thing legitimate not. Feeling extremely paranoid right booster article gave quite laugh  [*insanity wolf: Give Polio*]

Everyone falls back line fucker shows up.  According CDC predictions, counties Florida expected hit peak within next weeks. Instead, predict continued rise infections. going bad. know. moved metro-Atlanta south city, floored learn one hospital entire county.  80s, negligence word back then. they're saturating testing sites hospitals numbers less less accurately reflect severity spread got J&amp;J wanted “fully protected” quicker. I’m wondering short-sighted. Well that's shocker Get food to-go get delivered?

Unless somehow expect restaurants simply allow customer time? wonder travel nurses getting ny wages 15$ hr Newsflash. Kids get Covid. I'd like mention positivity rate county, Pasco, 22.7%. counties much higher, others low (where less dense population). little mask wearing indoors. county, well, let's say COVID irrrr ... rampant. isn’t like voter IDs actual structural barriers getting DMV. walk corner pharmacy walk half hour later vaccine, insurance money needed. reason black people lower vaccination rate distrust medical establishment, isn’t unfounded, case need get go get vaccinated. data used app called Xingchengka (It means Trip Card English) requires permission used. places require app displayed. Usually sensitive areas (such hospitals, airports train stations) require show it.  thing keeping civil fact take court future knowingly endangering child (especially get sick) nothing could used me. also think mental fatigue past year half dulled senses something.

Nope. thinking wondering makes likely hood vaccine resistant strain higher symptom profile vaxxed people. 

If eat dining safe? still I'm now. news reassuring comes children risks serious complications Covid-19, there’s indication Delta variant puts children greater risk serious illness.

The delta variant said infectious, makes objectively dangerous kids easily get it, even overall risk serious illness single infection changed. words, chances roll dice. 

It's also possible infections due changes behavior. Again, chances roll dice, could still risk single infection causing severe illness. people still wary   Speaking Texan follows state/local politics closely:

Abbott originally whole-hog whatever could defeat COVID-19. moving quickly early days--when state--that almost afraid going close state borders leave locked home.

However, changed weeks pandemic Shelley Luther incident. look want, tl;dr that

* ritzy salon owner DFW area business closed state order;

* spite this, protested opening business regardless;

* punishment jail time fine. punishments meted out, Luther (and people state politics orbiting her) launched GoFundMe media PR blitz raised *ungodly* amounts attention money.

* also happened time former prez starting deviate initial COVID plan into...whatever ended doing. primary-voting faction party *loved* it.

* Combined, two pressure points forced Abbott let Luther jail waive punishments.

In essence, kind equivalent Syria crossed Obama's ""red line""...and anything it, made look weak *and* made extremely unpopular sides issue.

Abbott nothing man driven political instinct knows read tea leaves. incident, epic power failure/snowpocalypse caused billions damages froze scores Texans death, takeover state GOP Allen West (a real character left leadership position announce intent primary Abbott), Abbott realized incredibly unsafe position. want get primaried seen ""too liberal"" addressing COVID, 100% end career. lose Republican primary Texas, done for. 

Until Abbott fears losing primary inaction taking action, he's going jack squat. used regret going medical school becoming doctor. I'm glad didn't. I've vaccine friends. opinions everything side effect vaccine. Lolololol, must new around here... Yeah, got exact message too.   million hospital beds, ICU beds. ICU care highly specialized. nurse doctor keeping someone alive artificially may recover. 

So matter, could million *ICU* beds, staff operate them, effectively *zero* ICU beds. *shrug* Probably costs fortune though. Here’s what’s happening Florida: ICU beds. beds period. people Emergency Department recliners. ICU level treatments patients regular rooms. means stretching ICU experienced nurses way thin cover everyone needs it. enough high level monitoring systems ICU patients. hospital using week's worth Oxygen every 2 days. O2 pump maintain 50 psi keep enough pressure system provide O2 every room crashed 35 psi last night, able get fixed."" hospitalizations tripled month ago, daily case count today highest it’s since March. may bit premature taking victory laps. Yes vaccination rate higher, they’re better it’s still high enough beat Delta. Things likely get much worse get better, even Mass. Let's take opportunity remember severe hospitalization COVID associated ~7 IQ drop. even mild cases require hospitalization, ~1 IQ point.   intentionally misleading people then? admit it? Thanks, DeSantis, finishing Trump started. pocket burial funds government it, dick. *Mississippi* fucked! Yes EU it. case here, hell even LA it, one city within state. even national covid passport business verify regardless got vaccination. Many business even enforcing mask mandate, sure seeing trying enforce vaccination want inconveniences.

Death convenient, since means immediate termination inconveniences. Unfortunately, long COVID much inconvenient mask 2 shots. Louisiana mask mandate reinstated.  Data get ""peer reviewed"" 3-6 months, usually. There's preprints place, one covers delta AFAIK.

But go case, infection. Researchers seem given assessing seroprevalence(?) trying figure many infections go untested. local school district Oregon used FLVS, daughter went 1st grade.

It's great, certainly better nothing. directions somewhat nebulous definitely seem like they'll cater better higher grade levels. woulda thunk, two redneck, states next Shitexas post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

I’m doctor, assumed were. biology background research-based graduate degree. life circumstances also I’ve become intimately familiar COVID physiological effects due young family member’s condition makes particularly susceptible it. Also, entire family doctors, ranging GPs cardio thoracic surgeons, imagine, we’ve conversations COVID. 

I’m also sure kind doctor are, unless specialty pediatric vascular research cardiology, I’m sure you’re especially qualified making concrete statements disease still know next nothing about. Almost everything conjecture right now. 

Yes, assertions perhaps bit overly broad confident. I’ll dial back future, interpretation current research, consulting multiple doctors exactly stated. I’m expert, interpretation existing data. welcome draw conclusions, again, conjecture longer-term data. It’s political issue. Poop masks excuse. 

Statewide Arkansas 36.58% fully vaccinated. Less fifth 12-17 year olds vaccinated. 

When people refuse vaccinate, it’s mask lots kids/staff quarantined instead school. I’m experiencing lot symptoms got rapid test negative. doctors still unsure tell rapid test isn’t effective longer one. chest hurts, top vomiting, diarrhea, fever, sneezing, coughing, stuffed/runny nose. told boss everything denies fact rapid test could wrong, demands get longer one come back work ASAP. 

I terrified, feel like either get everybody sick get fired work. Even it’s flu, that’s okay, right? 

I don’t know do. here, gone back wearing masks even though vaccinated want unvaccinated kid catch it. You’re fucking idiot. I'm mad really tearing but... well end taking legal action later anything happens child texts could used suppose. I'm numb right thinking possibilities. That’s frustrating we’re comparatively inefficient it. go specific vaccine centre like GP done here. went centre they’ve set church mine, book slot wait big line. would way better could get done supermarket haven’t heard anyone here. 

You guys also approved (or going to?) teens us could smack head inaction point. sensible nation would getting highschool kids vaccinated summer holidays go back breathing other/ making school! no. We’ll surprised breed funky new covid variety September guess. 

Voluntary uptake seem bit higher though, 10 people company getting pitiful point stubborn stupidity citizen's. Health care workers quitting rather take mandatory vaccine. Lol... means last month. caught despite fully vaccinated. Loat sense smell today.

Covid discriminate (as far know). Biology (and extension medicine) messy complicated. Nothing ever 100%, part herd immunity important part vaccination campaign. COVID-19 vaccines significantly effective annual flu vaccine notably less effective measles polio vaccines, partially flu mutates quickly measles polio don't, COVID-19 mutates somewhat less quickly vaccines targeted spike can't mutate much still going able infect humans. assume addition mutation concerns, there's also something virus immune response work mean vaccine can't 100% effective. alternating view could precisely behaivior allowing society unhealthy, careless general know get cared regardless cost. 

Cost care people usually gets amortized rest society feel pain time feel pain due costs increasing across board late something.

Answer question, single ICU beds 2 patients severe pnemuia, age etc. One covid vaccinated. non covid related case vaccinated. gets bed? Whelp 3yo son caught covid daycare 3 weeks ago another 3yo (confirmed via test, asymptomatic). Im vaccinated (J&amp;J memorial day weekend) week I've mild cold today completely lost smell. #justdeltathings necessarily. Lots poorer developing countries afford testing, it’s treatment that’s issue. I’d also say cases US nowhere near accurate, especially now, politicized it’s people unwilling get tested. issuing new order temporarily halting evictions counties heightened levels community transmission order respond recent, unexpected developments trajectory COVID-19 pandemic, including rise Delta variant. intended target specific areas country cases rapidly increasing, likely would exacerbated mass evictions. That's misleading math? telling people death rate .002% taking 100 deaths 4.3 million people isn't?  problem idea denominator make guesses, sure hell 4.3 million. want see percentage hospitalizations vaccinated. Best could getting spike antibodies measured. US, get done Quest Labcorps without prescription, cover cost pocket. Quest's service $80 Fauci seemed know shit first, keeps going one extreme another. long everybody sitting down! googled ""intrusive"". First definition comes causing disruption annoyance unwelcome uninvited. also don’t know long term effects. People throwing kids wolves. would Abbott's counter this? Litigation? thought quick calculation shows overall mortality rate confirmed infections 2.5%. multiply breakthrough infections 2.5%, total number deaths would doubled. vaccinations preventing infections general, reducing hospitalizations, breakthrough infection mortality rate halved. 18,000 deaths Covid total. math 9,000 lives would saved vaccines year half ago.

Filled MLB stadiums fine.. right? Increased premiums would probably easier pull off. There's precedence smokers.  called heaven's waiting room reason. sub absolutely fascinating right outsider. wish though I’d bet magnitudes breakthrough cases never know symptoms mild enough people aren’t even bothering tested.

The sub headline article 100 deaths 4.2 million vaccinated people. That’s pretty low death rate. lot stupid people idk - vaccine. 

And it. 

This stage 2. 

Attempt herd immunity. 

But since trump fucked first part.. makes second part harder. difficult know actual rate breakthrough cases are. Asymptomatic vaccinated carriers may numerous know never get tested. done months ago Delta variant spread country badly is. Gotta drinking smoking cig time - others choose sober wear seatbelts they’re scared. US go almost drug store Wal-Mart get shot. live middle nowhere super rural area there's still multiple places offer covid vaccine. husband's work place even brought nurse vaccinate everyone company. Know many actually got shot? 10. it. would lose GI bill get General Along lines, 90% residents 65 vaccinated, relative numbers (compared total) going overstate risks vaccinated closer get saw something like top 5 states recent outbreaks CA, TX, FL (top 3 population), GA (like 9th something)... Louisiana. like 25. Actually exactly 25, guessed looked lol Ah man though, understand it’s walk in, cover logistical issues. I’ve said comment, America big, places remote, places densely populated, struggle believe supply exactly matched demand everywhere time? Like, still vaccinating people England lot smaller population lives lot closer together. 

I get it’s technically available, kinda want fine detail logistics anyone hasn’t able get yet reasons vaccine denial really want society never see faces?

........yeah kinda 😅

I hate smiling people hate talking people hate smelling people. 

But see non-anti-social people may masks lol. Yeah cuz numbers surrounding accurate lmao interpret data however like, even small sample size, *100%* sample members exhibit biomarker, extrapolation becomes bit less contentious. also question validity biomarker, shown accurate clinical setting.

There's extensive international evidence lasting damage children, that's seen immediate aftermath COVID. Studies show 40 percent children Italy approximately 15-20 percent children England experiencing “long-haul” COVID-19 symptoms. know symptoms manifest future result damage done. vascular damage increases clotting risk, increases risk stroke. Hell, we're already seeing kids COVID strokes. Additionally, clinical findings found global incidence strokes measurably increased across world since pandemic began.

All evidence points vascular damage direct consequence COVID infection.

This minor disease kids, much like people believe. Americans ready access 3 different vaccines least 3 4 months since April)

They available everywhere, logistical issue. want one get same-day, like said like months tried get family 5 tested last 2 days. testing within 45 minutes except Mondays Fridays. tried book one places open appointment times hour away apparently don’t test people 3 years old. place found hour 15 minutes away charges $85/pp, going cost $425, might get reimbursed insurance. 

Long story short, we’re getting tested unless still symptomatic Friday. assume 3 breakthrough cases two reinfections house go anywhere least 10 days. 

Testing access issue anymore. ridiculous. Idk CDC saying “may” dangerous = “the CDC says it’s dangerous” suppose bullshit spread Internet. 

All data every country dealing already dealt delta shows case fatality ratio significantly lower. 

The CDC doesn’t information guarantee factors say “may” never make guarantees unless they’re positive. imagine people get sick personal acquaintances anything else.

For example, didn’t get sick stopped masking started going places. got sick goddamn niece, kids germ factories. new hero know absolutely nothing else him. You’re exact person made people feel compelled hand free condoms places demand outweighing supply?

I know single place US right cannot get vaccine within 50 miles are, within 24 hours wanting it.

Every pharmacy them. importantly, every WALMART them. Every hospital them, hell grocery store pharmacies them.


We surplus rediculous. state actively fighting idea wearing mask (and since beginning), much less getting vaccine.  


At point, spending year masking, distancing finally getting vaccinated, find variant come due many getting vaccinated...I even know feel. Well ,i mean people also die ugly cali CRAZY restrictions…..
You take covid situation whole word …it pretty much result everywhere, mask mandatory etc etc ….

So yeah ,Florida handle better ,we also die ,but least free.

Not looking confrontation, vaccines wear mask everytime asked to. possible scenario. Look Provincetown MA... 3/4 infected vaccinated. caught 3yo despite fully vaccinated. Delta vaccine resistant. I'm sorry hear long-term impacts 'rona sense smell.

For science amusement, given appropriate privacy protections, hope future AI finds comments like able make meaningful hilarious conclusions.

Skipping past jokes ""stop smelling fingers"" ""how flexible you,"" lemme jump straight conclusion populations known suffer over-inbreeding could potentially benefit symptoms described.

May bits soon smell sweet may have.  need keep watching Florida. Monday 40 kids admitted hospital.  need hope/pray/worry trend. live?  Okay thank sm 🙏 agree 0.002% number misconstrued. raw numbers touted headline. apples/oranges comparisons pool vaccinated vs unvaccinated population sizes age distribution different. Plenty antivaxxers determined downplay effectiveness vaccines way. Media's done mixed job around this. definitely complicated new variants develop, potential fading immunity, variety variables involved (severe infections vs effectiveness preventing illness vs spreading it) much better job done communicating.  Ron DeSantis actively trying spread COVID-19 Florida, would differently? thought transmit outdoors? live Texas 7 year old choice attend school in-person 2nd grade, among bunch kids likely masked up...

This setting covid wildfire I'm honestly scared shitless son. Yes, technically internal document said may cause severe disease, listed 3 studies showing none showing doesn't. want absolute certainty, discuss math instead science. Apply fo unemployment asap make sure put person said. *if get fired WSJ article:
Israel’s Health Ministry recently announced five months double dose Pfizer vaccine remains 91% effective preventing severe disease 39% effective infection. Israelis 60 received last shot least five months ago eligible third dose. Germany said offer third shots elderly sick starting next month, White House officials told reporters soon advise Americans 65 immunocompromised get them. ""Unexpected"" blind fool purposely ignorant. Anybody paying attention knew mask guidance update back May stupid entirely political. Everybody paying attention knew fall 2021 soon end housing rental assistance soon enacted. games them. Ha. I'm electrical engineer working company makes cutting edge technology, got without help anyone. probably make you. many people age younger, however, never recover this. Ever. feel them, I'm sociopathic boomer like you. figures could find say 59% one dose, 50% two doses total country. 58%/49%. absolutely need federal mandates. know, get data 24 states plus DC. I'm sure answer DeSantis politics. Actually demonstrates exactly point: slightly different, mRNA vaccines slightly less effective.

If room change e ough invalidate vaccine still infectious (which really isn't) make new vaccine targeting that. 

Instead talk booster shots current mRNA vaccines, they're still close enough simply increasing robustness response looks like win. Beshear GOAT. bad he’s governor Kentucky lol. People don’t listen reason Oh no, done volunteers specific centres, ask questions give leaflet. know one person who’s jabbed GP, assume happens sometimes that. 

Seeing GP free though there’s nothing stopping people asking personalised advice particular concerns. friend pregnant wanted know ok first grinding gears government talk importance boosters make getting first dose look bad per leaked CDC documents. think happen forever? next bit? idea happen forever dumb ludicrous. patient abandonment nurses part? Omg please take care yourself!! human resources dept.? That's ridiculous, sick work, covid sheesh~ Feel better!! Damn apparently smart enough figure Dumb theory:. burned unvaccinated vaccinated hosts left infect 🤷 That's awful. envy parents young children pandemic -- choosing send kids back school continue homeschooling hard decision, made even harder government actively making schools less safe. 

My heart goes family. children fortunate two parents care much keeping healthy safe. hope able come solution fall, Florida adopts common sense public health measures support near future. Best luck. Heartbreaking. like, yeah understand scared given medical history, keep talking. There’s Delta Plus well Typical case software guy understanding hardware could. Florida already covid deaths difference votes last election. JFC hope correct states (especially Florida) either peaked, days so.

I'm beyond horrified watching what's going that's saying lot someone NYC lived street refrigerator truck storing bodies outside hospital April 2020. Mask policies reinstated Monday. Problem idiots still wear them. 1.8% near beginnings last summer, ever trended lower since initial estimates 3% Feb/March 2020. 

Again, never .1% whole crew got first shot day Christmas.

 assumed late February last year. lost sense smell taste, two negative flu tests, fever 104, delirium, cold chills, shakes, trouble breathing, muscle weakness, inability stay awake, sinus congestion lasted seven days followed months lethargy muscle weakness. ER serving several people ""new flu strain"" without masks every day got sick.

So, yeah people piss off.  think 11 y/o would become 12 day... mean c'mon mannn, supposedly fewer total cases freaking Finland

And would surprise?? Finland locking entire villages districts major cities single case gets discovered? Finland level contact tracing place? Finland closed tourism since beginning pandemic? Finland gone lockdown single member household allowed go grocery shopping (at certain time), police checking make sure home? people Finland ""check in"" get temperature measured workplace, restaurants, shops, etc.? 

Covid response EU nothing short joke. =( Yeah get either. I'm expert bad long term NEVER get sick? That's good hear thanks update. Requiring people go GP smart, inefficient. gives doctors chance look patient conversation giving vaccine. way would cost patients money thanks shitty healthcare system. hard time getting go doctor. seems non-natural solutions. Unfortunately, live theres large anti vaccine presence lot people telling things. I've told want try keep safe. dont want anyone know learn hard way... Chin-Com talking point moment  thing Ive read affect they're good evading therapeutics little evolution variants. Meanwhile people dead wish could go instead. absolutely daft, moronic thing say I’m willing that! Thank you. Lmao completely useless you’re saying. way gets published  countries you’re concerned don’t ability store mRNAs, even cross mind simply Internet gatekeeping warrior? remember news first came out, myocarditis Pfizer vaccine presents younger men. even rare. 

For worth got shots Pfizer didn’t side effects, 31 years old male. Neither brother 26 years old. Yes is.  part problem   hope Desantis's opponents keeping track every death illness happening lack leadership .  


the amount damage he's done people Florida needs logged. comment makes head hurt, even 72degree perfect low humidity weather. 

Florida many things, better handling ‘rona Stupid bitches. Coronavirus unique proof reading enzyme RNA viruses don't. mutate much less RNA viruses, sheer number infections allow opportunities mutations arise. Early people sort miscalculated public would respond NPIs allow infections mushroom control.  ,, Abbott said - go border he’s re-election next year. You’d think right? Conservatives don’t exist anymore. con men talking points. lot trouble finding one? Wearing mask sick perpetually two different things society experienced scale like Call CNN, call Governor CNN line. Ask emergency support. need look new job feel better. I'm horrible math 4.3 million vaccinated vs 2.6 million unvaccinated tho.
(27/2,600,000)*100=0.001%
(9/4,300,00)*100=0.0002%
Without vaccines would've ~43 deaths among fully vaccinated instead 9. Vaccines prevented 34 deaths last week Massachusetts. account fact vaccines also partly slow infection rate.  state in? online programs free school district. one called Connections academy. research, call local district ask online academy. go guys, let's shoot foreign travel Delta responsible. planning trip. comforting hear feels like entire country going shit right now. 

But recall Scott Gottlieb saying similar things weeks ago though, going drop quickly arrived. many states already starting peak, mean could see light end dark tunnel within two weeks so?  Alabama, won’t work. People go ballistic. curious nurses walked out. burn blame them, they've already hell.. Anyone still around point goddamn machine put have. unfortunately mayors congressmen can’t that. need think unvaccinated.

Going fact fact many government turned issue political warzone ""rights"" opposed obligations looking guidance. safe get vaccine emergency approval, full expert Science talked message: data amassed far show vaccines given EUA United States safe effective. “It really incredible see well vaccines worked clinical trials,” Gandhi says.




Well except missed safe effective part.


So yes, excuses total BS.



And full approval granted, antiVa goalposts move again.  two unvaccinated kids.  keep away crowds.  22 month old hasn’t even store ever.  whooping cough outbreak right covid.  Funny antivaxers limits freedoms take kids out. What's wrong usenet? See, thought people meant said ""vaccine passports"" Great… That’s getting another shot. Denied. pass 4 days needed sooner. believe us? See eviction moratorium. CDC beginning, lot others like would mistrusting. Pandemic became political became manipulated fear. one saying stop taking covid seriously could mutate less severe version. We're saying fretting (or hoping) possible mutations pointless. need react situation we're in. reasoning fearmongering sub. US locked down?? mask mandates handful counties whole country implemented recently. Sweet tapdancing christ. 

Stop. fucking stop provably false tests cant differentiate covid flu

Google fucking sentence right now. completely totally wrong *literally* dozens sources stating exact statement false product viral misinformation post social media. science longer apply here? Human immune systems evolve understand next variant be, improves immunity exposed future variants. liberty, nothing. I'm American living UK lockdown here, brutal...but could least walk around, go grocery wanted to...and even living. nearly left go back US, opting take chances choices. It’s rate change rate change. It’s fast something growing decaying, case expressed Rt number new infections per case. 

So show Rt numbers dropping 1, meaning new case results 1 new case slightly less 1 new case. used 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, etc., meaning growth accelerating well increasing. 

Getting 1 means means growth rate flattening rather still growing. 

If plotted actual cases accelerating Rt figures get appears exponential growth w/ steep intense increases (1.2, 1,3, 1.4, etc.). 1 flattening stage followed declining Rt moves 1. looked tracker, 164 confirmed cases. FML. kids complaining masks picked adults around complaining masks. seems inevitable eventually ‘Balrog’ variant arise vaccine can’t touch. May God mercy us day comes. link directly study? I'm getting paywalled article lives matter..BESIDES MINE?? terrible see bad people actually are, fully convinced already lifetime. That's CFR, true fatality. somewhere much closer 1%, dropping poorer countries less 0.5% rolling 3rd shot dose? guidance long second dose? certain high risk demographics? would love know data saw headline went lol Maybe I'm missing something, I'm sure similar.

The recent Florida vaccination information age could find [this, June 2nd/3rd](http://ww11.doh.state.fl.us/comm/_partners/covid19_report_archive/vaccine-county/vaccine_county_report_latest.pdf). Comparing [Florida population estimates 2020](http://edr.state.fl.us/content/population-demographics/data/pop_census_day.pdf), imply take 86.1% least one dose 74.0% fully vaccinated. sounds right considering article month earlier (May 81 percent Floridians 65 older — 3.6 million people — received least one dose vaccine Wednesday, according Florida Department Health. 3 million seniors fully vaccinated.

In England, August 4th, 97.4% least one dose, 95.1% fully vaccinated (using [NHS England reported doses age comparing [mid-2020 ONS population use June 3rd data make fairer comparison, 96.9% least one dose, 93.2% fully vaccinated.

The difference 86.1%/74.0% 96.9%/93.2% *massive*, lot larger sounds comes population outcomes. try demonstrate using numbers:

* Florida, vaccinated population 6.2x size unvaccinated population, fully vaccinated population 2.8x size unvaccinated population.
* England (using June 3rd data), vaccinated population 31.3x size unvaccinated population, fully vaccinated population 30.1x size unvaccinated population.  enough staff proper care. “A bed” includes staff/resources care, literal space.

Oddly, turns cells make antibodies linger forever; rather, cells make cells make antibodies.

This allows body rapidly ramp production old enemy reappears, free resources they're longer needed keeping blueprints future year.

Java programmers might well recognize often-mocked FactoryFactory design pattern. enough people cover bed longer. physical object bed pointless unless trained staff care critically ill people. loss three trained staff members means hospital can't use bed provide high standard care critically ill person occupying it. Without nurses, occupying hospital bed different bed home.  many dead then, delta spreads quickly. one save them

That said, let's still stupid &amp; keep licking tonsils infected people... different Jebus. Thanks! We’ve tried nothing we’re ideas!!

- Florida Seems like common theme way many places. Appreciate that. job trying best help can. bad vaccinated individual spew viral load infected vs unvaccinated individual. Maybe live state like Florida takes long America ain't voting dude wheelchair. care ... There's evidence variants deadlier others deadlier original. They're significantly contagious, yes. slightly vaccine resistant, yes. that's it. r/QAnoncasualties. need healthy boundaries drag them, like addict really board ER simply time, resources, training manage kind patient.

I ER nurse 4 years. Even boarding med/surg patients challenge emergency rooms designed care past hours. there's almost 0 chance patients getting turned, teach care, etc like would ICU. That's also ER bed taken up, too. offense: parents suck. flus before, felt different. think illustrative general ways. see income disparity impacts pandemic prognosis. I'm sure Colorado better job state's data majority others. “But hospitals empty??” four days later. flus before, felt different.  explain nurses left? Except can, precedent exactly topic. already read headline last year???? Bout ton completely unnecessary non covid deaths SE US. Magic science tools/data investigate yet. 

But agreed. almost panacea-ish, oddity. fact treating many varied things.

And kicker is, we're virtual kindergartners understanding Cannabinoid biochemistry. field blow wide open, along several related lines study. 

**We. Need. To. De-schedule.**

Put hands scientists, law enforcers. think mixed lemmings pied piper. 100% send em home die. care less. older family friend mine died covid. Fully vaccinated, serious underlying health conditions. whole family got maybe they've got genetic disadvantage?


But part expect wanting tell many people it. Breakthrough deaths still incredibly rare, want tell people happens case they're fence getting vaxed  Sign surge delta USA. live Midwest similar problems getting rapid test appointment. I've heard anecdotal reports thing Reddit.

Try local public health department testing, primary care provider, call see order test.

Btw, I'm planning ordering home rapid test kit hand seeing shortages testing  Link moderna report article based I’m amazed they’re keeping code bed. Many hospitals didn’t even COVID. (Source:travel nurse)  CA last winter ZERO, California zero. southern States hurt.  worry it. CDC posted contraindications getting vaccine gear one (there contraindications). Good luck! problem doctors start favoring antivaxxers made choice. medical system making others pay. absolutely unfair source that? highly doubt current vaccines still effective 2024 another fuck masks person/get everyone vaccinated, would wear mask case. wore masks got vaccines around parents finally got vaccinated well.

As aside people wear masks usually refuse wear want wear masks. want enable/live society masks mandated. However always situations may need wear mask.  98% vaccinated. wow. They're picture. -Pam case, missing much. announcement lacked important information, recently study ended. It’s clear whether extended recent months Delta variant became dominant. could vaccinated chose to, think give hospital bed.

You get harm others poor choices. I've tried personal work PC get thing.

I checked phone let me.

Strange. I’m situation! Unfortunately, don’t think high chance waiving test requirement anytime soon since case counts rising places… I'm assuming stopped elective surgeries, right?

My hospital generally handful ICU beds despite large, University hospital. that's ton surgeries maybe 5-7 daily end ICU. magical plant. use there's denying benefits.   far doubt vaccination that.

Show evidence vaccinated people mutations. They're still spreading getting it. Thanks her.
No reason favor covidiots chose destiny stop treating everyone else. poor quality 'statistics'. 

They mention incidentally relative prevalence various occupations.

For instance, lumberjacks could possibly highest rate death per lumberjack employed, since lumberjacks Colorado, would rank low scale.

I also wonder accurate base data is. sad people vaccinated still get sick end fucked alongside non vaccinated Paywall  really really hard drum empathy.  definitely don’t sympathy unvaccinated choose point, lack hospital staff affect multiple areas care. People still heart attacks, car accidents, etc. There’s level burn compassion fatigue hitting multiple areas medicine everyone society feel it.

Can’t happier he’s gone wish Desantis worst lives stake Desantis turning Florida covid breeding ground. Bullshit. always come excuses. Truth pace vaccinations decent outset.

It’s not. people choosing get vaccinated.

They perfectly aware risks, plenty time get shot.

Yes it’s sad. Yes it’s terrible. it’s certainly fault. all.

(Different story people cannot get vaccine, priority could chose to)  /r/rimjob_steve depends goals. goal infected infected asymptomatic case low viral load active antibodies would likely help. goal avoid hospitalization likely memory cells good enough.

I seen evidence would insinuate high level antibodies pandemic would ""bad"".

There plenty uncertainty roles memory cells vs antibodies studies required make definitive statement regards.

Just clear matters would like give example.

If high level antibodies would much comfortable visiting elderly parents (75+) age. memory cells likely protect serious infection antibodies would likely prevent ever getting viral load high enough infect someone else. Could memory cells rush action create enough antibodies make low base level? Maybe. 

My major goal avoid getting infected, infected transmit anyone care especially elderly parents. high level antibody titers likely major player accomplishing goal. informative, thank you! fine right desktop chrome...  know Delta spread among vaccinated people, argument boosters convincing used be. virus spreading nearly unimpeded United States right now, almost 100,000 new cases per day, selective pressure towards vaccine resistance. third dose could provide better protection actually stop spread, would meaningful difference. vaccines civilians usually don’t receive? so, military get them? deployments weird spots world?  lobster guy? not, guess. vaccines civilians usually don’t receive? so, military get them? deployments weird spots world?   that's way be. person still willingly unvaccinated receive empathy? displaying nothing selfishness idiocy keeps rest us vaccinated people risk ultimately coming contact variant overrides vaccines.

I personally live life close 2019 levels possible lulls major waves. 
I’ll hunker bit seeing significant community spread. 
Otherwise, I’ll take whatever vaccine available necessary hope best. 

Now really want get proactive, push legislation mandating vaccines @ government level. 
At personal level advocate workplaces mandate vaccines schools follow suit / see next age group kids cleared get vaccine. 

Good luck. doesn’t even really mean much right since purposely vague mean. It’s different statement say protection serious disease wane vs protection symptomatic infection wane. One would put line studies seeing obviously would like financial world read little different.  talking severe disease only? 3 6 relatives got Moderna got symptomatic breakthrough infections. know it’s anecdote, many similar stories (with vaccines). empathy vaccinated unrelated emergencies get adequate care plague unvaccinated clogging healthcare system. winter surge hits California Northeast lock even similar numbers florida seeing now, would see win base.   missed that. link?   obviously great Malaysia catching large percentage people vaccinated going shortage match budget developed nations procuring vaccines last year

even developed nations trouble that. Belgium slow vaccination start partially [vaccine delivery troubles]. Belgium PRODUCES Pfizer vaccine. yeah, imagine trouble there. reach herd immunity US. 

I doubt US reach herd immunity all. think lot Americans could gotten vaccinated didn't. [vaccination rate seems levelling hope antivaxxers big problem Malaysia? lasting heart conditions rare. Less 2% patients experience coronary artery enlargement carries adulthood. However, complications persist, impact patients long childhood symptoms disease subsided.""

Just reference although admittedly different disease seems similar severe covid children. 98% Kawasaki disease patients severe pediatric vasculitis, get long-term damage far tell.

Data like outrageous claim asymptomatic transient vasculitis child cause 100% issues later life. short:

* Vaccinations help tremendously, 100% proof, nothing life is. become breakthrough case, vaccination helps make symptoms mild versus deathbed. Vaccines train body respond it, prevent it. 
* unvaccinated people's fault they're basically, lack better term, walking petri dishes giving COVID-19 time mutate find ways around vaccine. people got vaccine, would give virus way less opportunity mutate. would consider win him? talking two fundamentally different cultures, societies, values West China.

I’d willing bet he’s vaccinated vague statements outlawed research studies. Without details it’s bit meaningless That's one things worked out.

Travel countries use permanently banned happening - initially maybe, permanently.

So vaccines get recognized. already recognized vaccines become available price countries use typically quantity (maybe even embassy consular affairs applying visa..)

And sometimes travel intermediate country recognizes original vaccine legally offer US recognized one price. obvious examples. Let’s say Right gets hands ability. sudden, gay sex banned name slowing HIV/AIDS. 

This sounds like mask mandates vaccine passport. analogy would vaccine HIV needed passport able orgies Fire Island whatever. According Washington Post, number tests reported Florida fell 12.8% previous week.

So know much trust rose 5% Fuck bro. Gotta go somehow get bleach clean tubes great scientuss say  Lets stop second appreciate tightness Chinese ""lock down"". I’m Alabama school district holding meeting tonight possible mask mandate. Way many organizing protest mandate. Kids kids, they’re taking away personal freedom, masks don’t help, virus hoax. Seems pointless arguing measure better used. Might well argue whether seatbelts save lives careful driving. absolute place town seen 10% people masks museum fine art, 95% patrons masks.

I'm starting see pattern there.  Imagine make call?? know make decisions like anyway situation could prevented.  Ever tried wearing glasses mask time? Foggy logic. Goggles hand... Yep. told pretty much talk Covid try push normal agenda much possible. supposed commencement 2 weeks spring 2020 graduates (of I'm included). I'm waiting cancel right masks required unless vaccinated (we saw well working). 
Students move dorms August 19th. report back (I delayed week) next week. I'll masking up. heard students complain it, honestly care. meant immune compromised peolle. bad one hand humans world need vaccine cannot get it. other, cross species spread seems seem like timebomb new virus. good place simulation… Damn, mosquito bite thing true? seem love O+ flavor. think moreso top ten vaccinated states. southeast like 35% vaxxed? Good luck happened NYC last spring. Paramedics would bring heart attack patients younger hospital low survival chances. dark. think one aspect missing Americans regularly don’t go doctor interact doctors little possible general. know people see chiropractor (not real doctor, don’t train medical schools sorry) way often real doc something seriously wrong. also low uptake flu shots even among teachers despite widespread exposure. 

Though Canada isn’t perfect, boy lot could improved, go walk clinic know won’t paying hundreds. America, literally would scrambling find $50 copay wait payday go doctor ill. breeds culture fear going delay going honest. 

Even though vaccine free, clinic went still sent bill $40 admin fee (which fight.) It’s really frustrating clinics shouldn’t even asking insurance even address- name, get card, that’s it. just...honestly, see lot people outside Alberta shit Alberta, think beautiful province hate idea divided. Premier awful. Albertans deserve bullshit. Good news, killing nutty base.

Bad news, much stress healthcare system danger kids 12.

A real cleanse need deadly pandemic. Except keep hearing that, instance, area Austin, Texas 12 ICU rooms free keep seeing pictures news hospitals people boarding emergency rooms days, hospitals Houston ""divert"", etc.

All stuff determined independently, *hate* conspiracy theorist adding well state government kept saying enough energy rolling blackouts wind power blame ice storm. I'm southeast empathy vaccinated people can't take vaccine still extremely careful. choose care get vaxxed idc. partners parents,brother sister fit second category. It’s fun arguing Facebook idiots though “your” local village idiots random keyboard warriors. Happy cake day! Sorry you’re sick though, make fun day.

Also, I’m sure there’s plenty unvaccinated patients X-rays look like vaccinated picture highlighted please send parents nice farm upstate lot land terrible decision makers play with. articles read aloud voice adults Peanuts cartoons. doesn’t say quarterly earnings report pretty damn sure talking serious disease. Seems mRNA vaccines antibodies waiting time studies. much antibodies play role preventing symptomatic infection vs memory B cells still super clear me. one case see reports (not scientific) Israel pointing waiting antibodies leading symptomatic cases. side coin trials Pfizer showed people preventative responses towards infection even low antibody responses pointing B cells offering least level near sterilizing immunity. 

I’m Moderna vaccinated don’t much confidence vaccine going different Pfizer far waining immunity infection. vaccines still seem awesome preventing worst effects disease. *gasp* *gasp* *gasp* world *gasp*  feel sad situation. Show husband best friend this. fact believe BS coming random person online, medical back ground education makes wonder logic gone.

The fact anyone 2 doses 99.9% less likely hospitalised covid. Simple fact.

I know whether video actual facts make difference. 

 know. We’ve seen many doctors nurses literally crying TV begging people vaccinate mask up, deniers like “nuh uh nothings happening.”  title literally ""does wane **SIX** months"", statement age month **TWELVE**? lol Essentially US going mandate vaccine thousand little ways, political situation opposed mandating outright.

Mandating arriving visitors pretty much another example list things like mandating enter bar.  contract day get shot, it’ll like you’re vaccinated, body hasn’t built immunity yet. don’t know vaccine help beat virus. Regardless, isn’t good reason get vaccinated unless you’re planning hide house surge over. thats countries except New Zealand seems. fuck anti-vaxxers public places? stop pretending choice personal? choice enables evolution virus, puts immunocompromised campus risk.

Get head sand look around. plenty examples, even website non-risk, healthy individuals dying virus getting debilitating conditions.

Don't believe want to, happening every day, every where. High Risk Low Risk people. thing non-risk. think one aspect that's throwing wrench fact AZ vaccine approved EUA US, probably thinking strategy require vaccinations order forego quarantine way allows AZ also count. measures could stop spread? Oh well, back crowded parties God sorts us. Louisiana BEGGING people get shot months. convention center New Orleans big vax site. Ain't nobody there. People getting vaccinated wearing masks what's making Delta variant spread like wildfire around corner... probably already mutated spread yet remote location. Even current vax %, probably lot mutations kept isolated.

That's whole point herd immunity prevent spread among unvaxxed.

Vaccine 39% effective vs Delta. live Japan tour comment sums thoughts pandemic Japan. agree Olympics isn’t mainly blame spread infection, barring cases among volunteers drivers work games, psychological effect people’s carefulness toward anti-infection measures (which admittedly hard gauge). 

However, feel like Olympics major reason government refrained implementing large-scale policies contradicts holding gigantic international event. example, last state emergency, movie theaters large bookstores asked open. efficacy policy last SOE bit suspicious, highly infectious delta variant, policies would mean something. know, none policies expect ban alcohol happening right now. reason Olympics (I think of) that’s stopping government implementing policies. 

Ditto CDC’s so-called messaging problem. listening American podcast agreed expert featured points tend leave children, non-vaccinated population, discussion. compared Japanese government, saying stuff like “we’ve vaccinated elderly population, we’ll fine” week two ago, level miscommunication looks almost trivial. Considering lied first months covid I'm surprised places ignoring everything say.

Lied transmissive human human first transmissive aerosols biggest lead countries lax quarantine type measures; ultimately leading first waves could've prevented.

These nurses walking facing overwhelming deluge ignorant, worm turds unleashing belligerent, even violent tirades them, actively fighting efforts provide care. think they're walking make point anti-vaxers though, they're simply trying save sanity, life cases.

And even fully vaccinated, break cases hospitals, what? 

This comes back point society expecting health care workers always show serve them, even offer sacrificial lambs, necessary. they've always CHOSEN show us led people feel entitled care. Nope.

 job, noble one maybe, still job. they've take decided want job anymore, that's choice, they're free walk away. feel resident physicians though. Working 80-100 hour weeks $50k, bound system can’t quit MD license jeopardy. Yeah lose upcoming election fucking idiot. free vaccine affect poor people?  know timeline 12 vaccinations point. massive curbing issue Yeah u catch twice year forever... mean thought point everyone agreed can't compare covid flu. Still people compare flu, alright. Sure, can't imagine feels knowing there's thing would prevent 95% patients showing they're electing it.

They're also taking valuable resources normal emergencies happen regular. okay call anti-vaxxers sub, dude. Important note taking even slightly larger doses sleep result vivid dreams trigger things like night terrors sleep paralysis. careful even arent taking anywhere near 100mg Indiana University suit brought students &amp; faculty whose exemptions denied, don’t think given people want one.

Two weeks post second shot, you’re “fully vaccinated.” It’s violation discriminate patients, walk away entirely There's lot unpack here. nutshell, I'm ok government agencies making decisions name health specific guidelines place first. instance bad disease need they're given authority? gonna honest, think FDA plenty problems corruption already.

Im pretty lost clue think might need firing gun air well since Texas talking about. also extrapolation CDC report infected vaccinated people “may likely spread Covid” infected unvaccinated people bad science. first wave, saw sports arenas soccer fields converted makeshift ICUs. done anymore? one:

Yeah... Southern California. We've got couple big cities coast, \*lot\* Southern California extremely rural. also say same. We're require vaccination cards clients, services. ...like lot. Cuckleheads Melatonin safe kids 9. Source, I'm physician. course check pediatrician anyways. can't disagree it, though. get that, 100%. People vaccinated could get lower priority limited resources. fewer vaccines golden-tickets Willy Wonka's chocolate factory. Lots long Covid cases from
asymptomatic minimally symptomatic cases, too. Even COVID, bosses really want giving vomiting, diarrhea, fever colleagues? Yikes! seen handful people wearing masks last week.  would guess saw 100 people time frame. 

I would guess less 10% wearing masks witnesses. kind feel bond see another mask wearer. try give ""nod approval thanks"" can.

But social pressure wear mask strong.  90+% maskless people, giving ""evil eye"" wearing mask. makes uncomfortable sometimes, uncomfortable ventilator on!

VERY little social distancing. Less 50% vaccinated here,  wearing masks. None unvaccinated people masks. breaks heart.

I work people overseas (Philippines, England, Denmark, etc.) tell *hopeful* able get first shot coming weeks.

Meanwhile, US, selfish assholes are, vaccine available anyone wants long time. 16 year old received second shot 6 weeks ago.

There literally reason anyone US vaccinated point (extenuating health complications aside).

I’m done anti-vaccine assholes. Ship doses overseas appreciate actually get shot get societies move on. would differently, rather would propagate spread. He's already amazing job it, else think FL #1, TX coming #2. worry though, today's numbers, TX race yet, reported huge spike cases. governors great job sabotaging recovery efforts. Yea that’s true. They’re probably hygienic begin with

I think that’s definitely true sinks though. It’s definitely dirtiest thing dudes touch bathroom changed arm point early 2000s. curious end game eviction moratorium. point, people going owe back rent don’t see sudden telling somebody who’s broke hell “all right, owe 18 months back rent end month” gonna work. can’t milk stone. fucking pissed believe case. I’ve seen ‘mild’ contrasted ‘requires oxygen’. well forget AV possible entire population US exposed delta next 60 days. virus ""run course"" case counts decrease then? Icu beds. Still beds. yeah. That's bad honestly think mask wearing going completely stop spread delta variant public school setting unless everyone wearing properly fitted N 95.

We put son summer program conducted elementary school premesis. kept virtual last year. needed interact kids, zoom meetings enough, us parents work. 

3 weeks summer program, horribly stuffy sinus, nasal drip, sore throat, horrible headache. tested COVID-19 negative. got better week.

There cold going around classroom.

It's disconcerting experience precautions say (they) taking COVID-19 schools program also work things like common cold, realize poorly working program. Kids wear masks properly. Many kids constantly pull down. One kid caught pulling blowing raspberries kids. cognizant fingers, mouths, noses, eyes. Distancing really enforced. moved kids kn95 masks son, effective well fitted responsible keeping rubbing hands face. Anything give little extra protection wherever possible good, kn95 etc., feel like losing battle.

We live fairly high vaccination area, think, delta aside, kids saved fact vaccination rates high generally, cases low community transmission low. That's changed delta variant recently.

But parents need work. alternatives. We're lucky live place responded well pandemic, can't imagine another area anti-precaution. comparing Dexter son? like flu shot, shit trash to. prevent getting it. sure downvoted. probably spot on. stress importance mask wearing times? teachers admin going punish them...? Ugh understand sides. flying domestically next week (all vaccinated) sort thought testing before. don’t think know it’d devastating tested positive. We’re going go CDC says…if we’re showing symptoms would sure get tested (and cancel so). we’d test contact someone tested positive. Otherwise feel like need live. hey man thanks do. I'm healthiest eater appreciate doctors still willing take care me...

but something remove couple years end life way compares ignoring measures stop global pandemic kill life long side effects.

further something completely overwhelming hospitals across nation. last time multiple hospitals across multiple cities across multiple states multiple countries overwhelmed heart attacks? oh mention heart attacks arent contagious amd dont perpetuate disease community people caring [Coronavirus: Residents welded homes great post, much appreciated. However unique question. fully vaccinated. However friend vaccinated yet seems fence. caught covid time ago mild symptoms, perhaps that's one reason they're hesitant (although told antibodies last forever.) They're totally anti vax, micro chip 5g magnet conspiracy believing bit concerned. see story UFC fighter Michael Chandler said vaccinated time Nov fight he's anti vax he's waiting FDA approval. I'm wondering that's also something that's concerning friend. question official information give say vaccines safe effective? know FDA approve emergency use, vaccines go rigorous clinical trials came back good results (I remember reading articles last November smile.) info use? Like said he's anti vax share ""you experiment"" meme theres little that. hope worded question right. Nope, I'm vaccinated kids 12 can't yet. going back mask law again. Already covid, I'm vaxxed, time go back normal. Anyone unvaxxed complaining people wearing masks get heck outta here. trying best. Im Malaysia currently top 3 daily vaccinations, entire country still beds low oxygen Uhhh 🤔🤔

Always been...  extent legislative process actually defined comes city councils voting. *exactly* proposed, law would passed using ""process typical law making"" complaint done ""process typical law making"" entirely disingenuous, *is* process typical law making.

And keep moving goalposts, consistent principles (heck, think government agency making decisions name health, also care FDA approval, since that's government agency makes decisions name health. existence antithetical one absolute statements) believe did, although tested negative. illness partner unlike anything else we've had, except symptoms vaccine received (J&amp;J). stomach issues day so, acute flu-like illness (fever/chills, aches, strong fatigue, headache) lasted one evening; tired. Friday last. woke Saturday feeling fine, fatigued. continued Sunday Monday. Following that, mild case dumbs afternoon headaches, clearing end week. got tested Saturday acute illness, came negative buy it. Everything lined covid, even 4 day delta incubation period (we believe caught cramped restaurant we'd eaten preceding Monday). obviously know sure. supreme courts already ruled 1905 vaccinations many questions I've stopped asking, answers never valid, including one :( express service!!! Haha. driving job decade. There’s many stories could tell, best watching Fairfax Co. EOD unit complete blast trailer getting stuck traffic way call. Lights going whole time. siren going hit traffic, killed immediately resigned fate. ever rolled Braddock, know slow crawl. Sure! don’t actual numbers hand I’ll make keep simple. general principle hold.

Suppose live city 100,000 people. city, 400 people hospitalized COVID-19 — 200 vaccinated, 200 not. Let’s also suppose nationwide vaccination rate 60%.

These researchers saw nationwide vaccination rate assumed held true city. estimate 60K vaccinated people 40K unvaccinated people, meaning 1/300 vaccinated people hospitalized 1/200 unvaccinated people hospitalized. Based estimation, said vaccine reduces chance hospitalization 33%. (Again, fake numbers here, I’m oversimplifying bit, honestly much.)

The problem first assumption wrong — highly vaccinated regions, it’s like there’s 95k vaccinated people 5k unvaccinated people. Now, would suggest 1/475 1/25 hospitalization risk, respectively. That’s like 95% reduction likelihood vaccinated person would hospitalized.

That’s essentially error made — assumed local vaccination rate roughly equal national vaccination rate was, fact, much higher. appreciate you. Thank everything you’ve done. people attempted use (anecdotal) fact reason reject vaccine.

It 100% effective therefore taken. 

It makes sense, people believe this. Florida send Washington like awful politicians. Also track phones cell signals. phone connect local cell phone tower get data, locate cell phone tower exchanged data phone, know you’ve been. think many cases phone exchange data multiple towers triangulate pin point smaller area. Since every SIM card registered citizen ID (no burner phones China), track everyone phone. know. It’s ease anxiety chicken pox story totally bums out, I'm sad little kid version you. really hope amazing Christmases that. I'm curious seem unwilling consider Huh? asked line drawn disease affects large area. copy/paste definition pandemic says disease ""affects region, continent, world"".. soo.. way saying yes? Lol. understand saying line drawn. difficult draw line you? make sure draw somewhere includes coronavirus totally keep saying covid vaccines mandatory without contradicting yourself. trick question. want know draw line authority make laws/mandates. ""if MedicineNet refers pandemic""? I'm lost. Another way putting this:

The spike binder protein COVID 'key' fits lock body. lets COVID cells. trained bodies recognize keys using vaccine. 

In scheme, mutation might make variant key body recognize. However, *this key still needs open lock*. change little bit, otherwise, key fit lock anymore. also means limit much change key, can't mutate spike binder indefinitely still work. know. fact Louisiana without per capita shows crazy high cases are. Yes. Didnt get tested 3yo caught 2-3 weeks ago. last week cold. Main symptoms cough, runny nose, sneezing, mild temperature (100F really fever per strict definition), fatigue/malaise. Today got complete loss smell though. Like nose spice bottles get nothing nose pickle jar get nothing. Dad family live NE Arkansas basically said it’s Holy Rollers got congregations believe outright bullshit reaping wind around him.

Dad never love first place it’s bugging much it’s definitely gonna fuck insular communities Pastors run towns… friend really [one breakthrough cases?

Did get Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine even though CDC said 65% effective? European? annoying hell. vaccinated people India? yo same, I'm O+, husband B. also situation people living paycheck-to-paycheck can't afford go multiple days without pay (or worse, get fired) they're put commission due minor flu-like side effects happen. gamble scare people off. Mandated paid time recovery vaccine would hopefully help.

As mention, government/medical distrust due instances like Tuskegee syphilis study also likely contributing factor. maybe people don’t understand, mean healthcare play “who sick” earn spot. really something don’t want win. dying US overwhelmingly (~99%) refused get vaccinated. point, really care?

As soon saw footage Italy China last year, took seriously. worst thing people like unbelievably confident world service. August happens flu season? Yeah I’m starting think headlines I’m recalling… possibly merging story CDC going they’ve recommended similar instances something like that; think getting vaccines earlier different parts population (ie; holding onto reserves elderly front line workers) something didn’t recommend initially “went CDC (something something)” Every time think people like true moral bottom... Epsilon downgraded variant concern variant interest believe may downgraded variant, I’m certain that. antibody studies I’ve seen indicated still neutralized high slightly lower clip wild type alpha.

I wonder many folks know. heard aunt mentioned helpful Uncle died (pre vaccines). families tough spot financially, help could really make difference saying Moderna better Pfizer? responding wrong posts purpose?  Clearly reading wrote expectation timeline. 

Its matter cross mathematical threshold vaccines, advisable use masks. Ah sorry. reason seem care. cuz 100 people breakthrough infections died doesn’t mean died Covid. get people vaccinated. Lot’s people may admitted hospital breakthrough infections, primary diagnosis cause death Covid.

We need see source data see people died Covid Covid. get one today want one. read literature make determination. comes booster shots governments weighing public health goals vs individual health. Even boosters effective easily make argument vaccinating people world wide greater importance. comes health make determination.

Is using misleading data like number tested breakthroughs compared vaccinated people? Well, that’s It’s minimal risk quite literally know long-term effects even mild covid cases.

The amount people unwilling get vaccinated believe bizarre conspiracy theory fucking insane. Not... really no. think misunderstandings statistics work. high confidence range small (but precise) small numbers without issue all. 99% confidence interval saying something 48 50 less firm 99% confidence interval saying something .00000013 .00000015. know Texas, Florida Missori make 40% covid cases living rock. Sooo….we’re fucked, right? Covid going endemic, we’re going able eradicate it, try point. social cost would far high likelihood far low.

Vaccines always endgame. trip 2 weekends ago 3 guys came back positive, vaccinated.. symptoms present feeling completely fine.. heavy binder weekend I’ve looked couple. 
Located Michigan. 
Nothing jumped outstanding. UK higher % adults vaccinated months now

Just Google vaccination stats country compare  read article earlier even kids go ER, cases mild end recovering home. know May numbers regarding hospitalization children naturally inflated. date, 74 million children United States, 300 COVID deaths thousand serious illnesses. Hospitalization numbers look worse, Dr. Roshni Mathew Stanford's Children's Hospital says numbers MATHEW: hospitals, child walks hospital admission, get swabbed hospital's experience, nearly half children positive COVID tests actually sick COVID.

And article children fighting lives, published today, still say kids coming emergency room mostly mild cases sent home said it’s early tell certain delta variant making kids sick. seeing children admitted, may kids getting infected, said. children coming emergency department end mild enough symptoms recover home.

Full disclosure, next paragraph doctor predicts might change future, wanted highlight happening now. isn’t, actually. People still catching COVID despite vaccinations (not extremely likely it’s happening) we’re fully safe til it’s gone. people didn’t willingly cooperate worse things. really requires everyone go little beyond get this. - person always got shafted extra work group projects. Hence extra irritation whining “I don’t wanna’s” [Here’s State (Phil Ochs wrote song 50 years ago.  could’ve written yesterday.)

Honestly, seems unlikely. someone AR MS say like? folks taking seriously? Like mask wearing? neighbor said maybe 5 10 % wearing masks big box stores. real world going tough wearing mask big deal. Best luck. even need that. Even Basic level EMT enough vaccine observation (even might overkill). far know none adverse reactions near-term deadly, long odd allergic reaction could survive ambulance arrives get hospital. Kind combo things. gov't clear timelines vaccines would get pretty money (actually predicted they'd come bit late, that's cautious).

One problem really domestic manufacturing. US lot course exporting vaccines number months, even ones using (including limited AstraZeneca).

The bigger thing purchase agreements. bunch countries bought vaccines various manufacturers. Canada vaccines got earlier Pfizer AZ. However Pfizer specifically think, Canada bought big block vaccines delivery certain quarter. happened however Pfizer supply problems delay lot shipments, ended happening agreements smaller shipments fulfilled first tighter deadline (instead say Q1 February). basically, Canada ended getting entire order right end quarter case.

Then started getting supply, tight bit like UK slowly open new age groups. Eventually opened everybody 12-40 Ontario kind big shitshow like half province trying book appointments once. Eventually started getting large deliveries Pfizer Moderna, stopped using AZ a) minor issues causing major issues vaccine hesitancy b) ran supply think.

Canada also made big purchases vaccine manufacturers still working trials, sure UK did. Novavax big one -- think Canada ordered 75 million shots Novavax alone. think Canada actually purchased vaccines per capita country world, delivered course may never approved/delivered. answer question; believe ""process typical law making"" laws apply specifically city Los Angeles?

You said things need go process, it? Hmm. I'll listen. idea covid come waves may true. size/poor outcomes absolutely go plausible biological mechanism not. we're lucky. That’s right.

Try again. Vaccines work well given R0 delta current unvaccinated population, mutate escape vaccine immunity, next variant may alot worse, like variance flu lead bad flu season. bad covid variant soon.

It's scary guys.... per capita. literally listed high population states. tell anything. think standard “until know doesn’t lead rapid significant drop baseline short term fails resolve” different “until every conceivable negative proven.” understanding UK also bit better delay getting second shots....turns creates better immune response compared getting second shot three weeks first. doesn’t make sense federal mandate way? can't force average person get vaccinated make condition employment. aren’t talking Russian, prove selfish mentality. don’t care you. It’s you. It’s everyone part protect community others, especially can’t currently get vaccinated.

Assuming lean left right. sudden body bypass constitution. going let body decide that. better draw specific lines. 

Again I'm saying allowed enact mandates name health/crises. saying going allow it, needs specific rules done. mean specific numbers agree to. Anyone finds putting regulations like place finds tying numbers power unnecessary thought through, they're ones want body charge right pass laws unchecked. concerning.

BTW, vaccinated, booked appointments soon eligible. want know lot breakthrough cases better understand actual level risk parents loved ones, might facing going forward. Relying bullshit, irresponsible figures based deaths/population credible way provide facts people want understand current risks even vaccinated. reckless irresponsible hide risks behind statistic like that, way reckless irresponsible spread anti-vax sentiment pointing fact 99.9% Americans die Covid-19 2020. Calling scientist research quack name calling definition trolling.

It takes minutes walk get vaccine. people poor least partly issues poor mental physical health, meaning lack life skills either get vaccine demonstrate compliance later on.

I doubt that’s asked free vaccine disproportionately affect poor - ways can.

I know much driven policy, versus virus running people infect people finally starting take individual precautions. statewide [indoor mask reinstated days ago, would thought would take time see effects that. Scrutinizing data equal anti vaccine. similar experience. first dose side effects mild injection-site soreness. got second dose \~9am felt unusually sleepy evening around bedtime. went sleep, slept hard, woke next morning feeling fine.

(I also sore arm second shot, pretty much expected.) disease *actually* damages organs Thank God got one. want die! kids need me.   You’re god among men. don’t know don’t quit. Depends state / district I’d imagine. 
In case remaining hopeful fronts. loads google it, equal amounts say works wonders. everything Covid, hard know whats accurate. Thats posts like largely ignored, balance them. parts Canada ICU nurses leading teams included doctors seconded disciplines. ICU care specialized nurses teaching doctors do. doctors paid doctor rates nursing leaders getting nursing rates. Ugh. getting one available older kids October? Last saw “maybe winter” 5-11 year olds. felt awful second one 2 days. know worse, great. true? 99% current cases US among unvaccinated people. absolutely reason variants spread US. 

But agree, need LOT get people countries vaccinated well. Kick nonvaccinated out. I'm serious. need accept responsibility actions. also think need legislation requiring vaccination want admission hospital. sitting indoor Starbucks indoor dinning? mean damn, I'm 57 looks like mom. Holy shit, must rough life. Sometimes worst enemies. fatal mistake. don’t think anyone prevented getting vaccine, heard people may benefit due circumstances moment, better time get vaccine (with data needed).

Even GBS often caused random virus variant mRNA vaccines (no cases linked). sure.

With new virus, changes well understood, though ideas.

Changes ORF 1 ""non structural proteins"" likely lead change well virus replicate cells.

Changes E might lead changes long particles last air.

And focusing spike protein expense focus others since beginning.

Delta many mutations compared previous variants. Antivaxxer convention say. could end well? mess SE, despite vaccines widely available. 

We went eat New Orleans maybe ten days ago, first time many months. still thinking cases decline, restrictions place...still, restaurant full capacity, waitress showed face covering knew mistake. Previous times went outside only, everyone covered face...I annoyed going.

Honest question: people life still deny COVID big deal, feel kind hoax?

Where hospitals overwhelmed (yet - knock wood) numbers gone control, however there's chunk people think means COVID blown proportion.

I find extremely frustrating, I'm even healthcare emergency management, bouncing hospitals perpetually full. 1. Vaccines might given areas poor people live - e.g., regional vaccine center accessible public transport need either car, ridiculously long journey/walk get there.

I'm saying factors accurate US, certainly saying they're insurmountable, asked free vaccine disproportionately affect poor - ways can.

Of course, vaccine passes help reduce incidence COVID return society normality sooner, *helps* poor people long run - I'm saying they're bad thing, either. That's seems accurate lol mean, that’s true. India 7.8% vaccinated. focus helping countries actually interested vaccinated.

Point finger everything except companies people ""donate"" money. really defeats entire purpose statement. I’ve never supported variants argument regard vaccination it’s basically bullshit. Even vaccinated every single adult America tomorrow, would gain much protection possibility escape variant. Anti vaxxers perpetuated virus country months, that’s true. delta come piddling 20k cases day spring/summer? No, came 4 bajillion daily cases getting pumped side world. escape variant, ever comes, same. could hit zero daily cases continental United States wouldn’t change damn thing regard. hope people stubborn make hard decisions time comes. lies!

It would nice logic would work.

I remember married arguing health care insurance. employer insured, purchased private insurance exorbitant rates obamacare. (Those rates sky rocketed btw... mess is)

But. stance be: health care *for profit* business. way make money deny people care need. Please take care mental health! really can’t imagine deal every day! hospitals already this, they're prioritizing unvaccinated people ruined everything people everything right tried best help simply antivaxxers got door first.

I think ethics surrounding first-come first-served need reconsidered. many resources frankly antivaxxers get last. example Starbucks need Barista standing door checking everyone cards. 

My understanding applies indoor dining, really. No. Vaccines continue necessary along non-pharmaceutical interventions. 

However, despite above, severe covid continue exist affordable, safe effective treatments still necessary. 

I find however dearth possible home treatments early stages disease troubling.

Are saying majority people ICU different easily preventable reason (like maybe bunch people took bad drugs festival, example, big crash Philly's wheelie kids drive 4 wheelers recklessly around city, kind gang violence situation), people would ones get passed over, specifically covid vaccine deniers, arbitrary reason avoidable injury one filled beds? sympathetic vaccine deniers (count crowd pissed keeping problem going making worse rest us), also think idea make sense. one dumbass reason injuring worse another common. easy get vaccinated, easy stop moron one. like easy stop moron crashes car repeatedly.

I firmly believe breakthrough cases would significantly reduced people vaccinated, refuse pin blame vaccine this.

Really vaccines adults need/get (assuming date others) tdap, flu, eventually shingles. think I’m also forgetting one 60+ can’t remember. (Of course covid well).

Edit: Note “normal” adults, risk factors, preexisting conditions immune disorders, may need take vaccines boosters. that’s something discuss health care provider, take face value Reddit comment. (Same goes general questions/concerns, take doctor). Duh impeach entire political party negligence? would mess card? we'll cross bridge get it. Dude, almost everyone hospital &lt;40 got absolute crushed Moderna #2, included.

Aren’t doctors nurses generally trained help sickest first? spiteful vitriol towards unvaxed getting fucking old.   oath harm. always feel empathy. still work required, don’t care results.

Plus, oath based social contract. I’ll tell people stay safe, stay healthy, they’ll try part. assholes couldn’t bothered wear fucking mask, felt safer chances catching covid hospital opposed going grocery store. So, broke social contract oath longer held towards either.

Are calling disarm cops knew risks shot joined force? disregard deaths soldiers “that’s signed for”? No, think doctors sacrifice constantly? I'm definitely guilty ignoring everything that's city large town comes covid.

Statistically hard measure things going fully rural area there's enough people secondary statistics like deaths work, hospitalizations get exported. know spotty case tracking is. Keep repeating this... Well hopefully works vaccine shortage. people nearing end vaccine shelf life allow become vectors again? don’t understand logic. countries already started distributing third doses extend immunity. I’m making look up. issues unvaccinated isn’t supply, it’s simply don’t want to. First dose wrecked me. body temperature fell like 95 degrees cold sweats couple hours tired move.

Second dose pretty mild, like flu shot. 

Oh residual worsening chronic pain lasted weeks... think many people point. sure am. India footage didn’t scare anyone straight. Nothing will. would also consider Moderna booster I’m you. received 2nd shot April..I get booster 6 months minimum actually estimated around 0.26. Thanks typo correction.  pretend gotten vaccine yet, there's national registry gotten already. insurance may ask questions put even need that.

^ this, hard imagine lol messaging really poor unrealistic expectations beginning (probably hopes getting get it)

I mean govt message get vaccinated covid19 return normal never really true. 

These Vaccines neutralizing never evidence would stop transmission infection. Basically work get infected , prevent infection. outcome way way better vaccinated could reduce period infection/infectious  Soros secretly airplanes. don’t understand people freaking “breakthrough” cases. vaccine history prevents getting disease 100%, isn’t surprising.

There couple reasons. Breakthrough infections may lead selective pressure vaccine resistant variants. vaccinated individuals infectious, endanger safety protocols around vulnerable population (elderly, etc), turn higher risk severe disease despite vaccination leading significant mortality. 

At individual level, healthy vaccinated individuals fear Delta all. ourselves, only, we? Otherwise, young people take vaccine. you’re around bunch people flu, polio, measles, etc., you’re still going infected virus despite vaccination. Vaccines prepare body fight off, don’t create virus force field around you.

Flu vaccines mediocre effectivity, really benefit receiver. Polio measles viruses, afaik, never showed indication immune escape. endemic viruses too, well adapted human hosts millennia. slide deck someone linked elsewhere post indicates they’re referring efficacy infection.

For US, imagine might hear senior risk boosters closer winter. really six months, point taking now? Yes, countries starting already. USA behind. Third doses vaccine extend immunity. US *cough cough cough* A!
*wheeeze*
Brrrrraaaaaaaaaaapppppp braaaaaaaapp rooooooom.

Freedom something something something. hear you. kids 3 hospitalisation RSV. first winter none hospitalized. I'm terrified coming winter bring. I'm genuinely glad feel better. Pain sucks makes people desperate. respect I'm sure I'm supposed take away anecdote. *think* trying imply experience cured spinal manipulation would something replicate study experiment. could would grounds say osteopathy alternative medicine. Good Typically well respected journals like ""Nature"" specialty specific journals publish. 

Nature kind gold standard peer review. wonder portion anti-vax population Medicaid. I'd bet significant. Oh no. half state like 10% population. husband allowing parents tell do? I’d tell take hike you’ll see get vaccinated. permanently life altered due lung damage need expert make believe TRUST you. logic completely unsound and, again, strategy I'm advocating others. said expert thing cuz I'm gonna get flustered downvotes words someone handle TomLube. mean wanna correct oil issues I'm ears.   confuses booster shots necessary moment. really want prevent variants emerging need vaccinate countries well. Deaths going sky rocket now. sad see  know lot good nurses, even hero nurses. fact less 50% nurses vaccinated made lose lot respect whole profession. apparent waning effect immunity felt across ages. age groups, early vaccinators 1.95 times likely confirmed coronavirus positive. Among aged 60-plus, early vaccinators twice likely get infected. aged 40-59 early vaccinators 2.1 times vulnerable, among 39s 1.6 likely catch coronavirus. simply educated guess based fact vaccine exists. vaccine offers sort protection virus all, less likely able mutate bodies vaccinated people. 

If true vaccine would ultimately pointless would constantly rapidly mutate avoid every vaccine create. slowly anyway, vaccines least slow   then... Sadly think deniers would still say paid actors trick taking vaccine, read stories everyday people thought fake serious contracting covid last thing say is, wish I’d gotten vaccine. Interesting. Anecdotal. interesting. Supposedly supposed bronco-dilator. don’t believe people virus still easily pass virus.

Yes. also know getting vaccinated means less likely get infected. would feel way feel time spread common cold someone. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Studies show Pfizer moderna similar efficacy last less equally long. 

I would draw many conclusions headline, least comparatively Pfizer moderna. best current knowledge, equally effective. Maybe, different drugs tend different doses target effectiveness rate, may well comparable Pfizer's vaccine. able call first check availability, I’d recommend that. Or, Wal-Mart also lets book appointments online, guarantee availability arrive… thing is, issue EUA, message sending parents? implicitly saying view COVID emergency kids? country opened, people less active. shit people fail look prior posting. Fatigue, joint pain, gut issues complete loss smell… year! fully vaccinated! COVID hell. Cannot comment source is, public dashboard facilities current occupancy data, maintained Federal Department Health Human Services: encouraging. really, people used getting vaccines still getting sick. People can't tell whether they've exposed can't know they're healthy vaccine herd immunity. know they've never measles, mumps, rubella, chickenpox. lock entire world down, there's going variant talk

and would still variant talk justify locking unstaffed ICU bed ICU bed. empathy left. Willfull ignorance choice. happens.... also explaining best. matters development maintenance memory immune cells jump action within hours exposure vaccinated instead taking week generate exposed before. Unfortunately though, measuring cells difficult life human patents, instead antibody levels used rough marker, honestly measured convenience usefulness. Im MA, CT nursing home residents something like 98% vax rate. primary way going get COVID staff. Also, elderly patients, vaccination immune response much lower general public. safety residents, one entering nursing home without full vaccination.  Right, right; long there's enough resources treat everyone. Covidiots forced situation triaging though, sickest get best care there's enough resources. curious school aged children? so, sending school? interested perspective. guess depends define effectiveness. Effective severe disease? Yes. Effective infection ? Maybe not, especially delta. Thanks info. slightly sore shoulder first shot, big deal. use - source data U.S. Department Health Human Services data. link think? Thank poop_scallions may biased...just little...but think best Barbie Dolls ever. Get Fox news play that, anti-vax might pay attention. That's thing now. shorter, rounder, fuller hips, lots different face shapes. drop zero 7 months. Relax. quick search local dispensary products available WA.

Edit: take couple pills, ggummies, sprays achieve dose. means I’m safer going out, forces people get vaccinated excluded, yes. won’t forever, Covid control. Okay, well, that's me, arguing wrong person. data general vaccine think specifically covid vaccines yet, general often drug/treatment administered less likely administered incorrectly. IMHO vaccine administration errors small concern right even worth thinking about. (When considering overall conversation around covid-19 vaccination).  use - use - source data U.S. Department Health Human Services data. think New Jersey started? Don’t think she’s places offer vaccine easily past months? use - source data U.S. Department Health Human Services data.  would probably due lack testing *Never-ending covid surges increasingly harmful variants brought GOPⓇ* think pandemic marked many stats... stats many first shots, second shots, many got sick age range age range, efficacy 4 weeks versus 3 months, etc. 

People sick want hear ... ""you're vaxxed get covid.""

The last thing want hear stats... vaxxed there's 99% chance end hospital 70 years age there's 60% symptomatic catch delta, blah blah blah

People want simple resolution pandemic... endless battery statistics. mention someone lie get 3rd dose, they’ll get way should. Modetna indicates today half dose 3rd dose *may* necessary line they’ve got preliminary data. feds requested trials expanded week ago. hold breath. remember *Popeye's customers* literally murdering gets order new chicken sandwich first? 

The fuck think gonna happen refused service entirely? problem also seems poor management hospitals 2 years covid possible living wages slaves One addition, since claim care science/medicine (but don't, since ignoring science/medicine medical orgs like AAP \[again, know kids? Stupid doctors\] inconvenient mentality): even kids learn swim risk keep kids away water. baths. 1100 kids! That's like 2x COVID killed year! 

I suggest keep kids away water on, safe. (You see binary risk measurements stupid?) far less testing vaccines subjected to? public health issue. Public health experts globally consensus quarantine, travel restrictions, mass testing, vaccinations, contact tracing essential tools managing pandemic. Bringing culture, values, society obfuscating issue politics. values include human life, get behind public health experts implement pandemic control measures. Seems like lot confusion uncertainty surrounding virulence variants could cleared could human challenge trials. paying vaccinated volunteers $30,000 infected COVID Mengelian crime ethics. Sending volunteers get legs blown godforsaken corner world discernible reason fine, though. US, vaccines available everyone since mid-April, would mean you’ve waited getting shot several months. 7 months would indicate specialty category, good majority us, like myself, around 3-4 months post 2nd vaccine. It’s possible working people keep track shit politicians do. That’s press important, click-bait emotional messages sell more, function failed.

A person‘s actions limited education information. Yes did. fact politicians cheated get vaccine early proof enough wasn’t rushed unsafe.  taking account variables like, example, covid tests nowhere near 99.9999% accurate. point out, need mix best worst case scenarios though. Look many people completely unprepared vaccinations approved late 2020, badly impacted rollout. went “that’s possible” “oh shit they’re here, do?” Still can't get good seal kn95. I'd like wear one work seal point, right? Might well wear surgical? Big fat citation needed that. 

And mRNA load, correlation two. mention idea “it better lasts longer” means. There’s data indicating Pfizer offers less protection less time. Comparing vaccinated folks unvaccinated folks catch covid bad faith argument. Viral load may groups vaccinated folks wayyy less likely catch first place, first step needed spread others. Same. bit sore arm nothing serious. I'd imagine, I'm sure. said trip 8 hours something absurd like tho. Yup. Death spiral. ""can't happen me"" mentality. funny, think bad effects vax ""will definitely happen me."" can't fix stupid. Please confuse CFR (case-fatality ratio) IFR (infection-fatality ratio). former strongly depends ability detect infected individuals (testing), know significant fraction COVID cases light symptoms. 

If test people got hospital like early days pandemic, get 10% CFR, IFR (still?) though around 1% western demographics. I’ll happily slightly balance anecdote saying ran 100f second Pfizer. quite bad you, hey. 

It’s innate immune system response anyway. There’s reason shot takes 1-2 weeks build immunity. initial feeling isn’t building antibodies immunities, it’s literally innate immune system freaking going “oh god holy shit there’s much stuff deep shouldn’t sound red alarms go overdrive”. Rather tactical antibody strike memory vaccines hope elicit. 

At least that’s understanding.  Today: 864,000 new shots, 585,000 first shots.

Highest vaccine day month. need someone link study says vaccine works point probably going read anyways. Good know! makes sense agree it. guys  No, need make vaccines mandated. force another lockdown.

You people don’t realize everyone job work home right? I'm sure mean? Thailand's case count 670k 5503 death. Vietnam's case count 185k 2720 death. Thailand higher case count death Vietnam, though percentage different.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  personally would like collect all. Got J&amp;J, waiting green light get Moderna booster. I’ll get Pfizer third shot grab Novavax AZ power levels already chart.

Just need Covaxin I’ll able snap away half life universe. 100% agree, pointing fact purposely vague. Within financial release touting efficacy vaccine time stating antibodies wane 3rd shot necessary winter. also using 93% number without defining means, document like this, accident. ambulances radios communicate hospitals... understand wait get hospital find there's room prosecuted crimes humanity Anecdotal know someone go ventilator came fine. Sorry multiple questions, couldn’t find data study…

So study putting therapeutic dosage ~1500mg, daily basis? One-time? words, often dosage administered? Everyone seen saying basing metrics take weeks reflect new deaths. patent, that’s all. Wow, can’t wait see studies find. use CBD anxiety. effects Pfizer too. 

Also effects innate immune response don’t correlate vaccine efficacy/uptake. 

3x “stuff” innate immune system respond to, whether develops antibodies stronger/more memory cells entirely debate. Oh, I've already heard excuses.

""If safe, FDA would given full approval first place.""

""If fully approved before, what's actual reason approving *now*?! There's something Big Pharma telling us.""

""Pretty convenient timing would approve public knows much worse shedding originally thought.""

""The politicians behind FDA must paid Pfizer. There's way suddenly safe enough full approval."" “I’m one people doesn’t believe China’s case numbers…” translated normal English: “I’m one people hard time reconciling facts evidence preexisting beliefs biases China…” system track might take third dose yet, case need proof officially line. agree! 

They need learn say “no entry” unvaccinated restaurants, gyms, bars, indoor venues :) Masks school work aren’t big deal imo. They’re big deal restaurants, bars, concerts, gyms, etc. bet PE terrible kids though right now. I’m trouble understanding various reports coming haven’t following things closely. protected either mRNA vaccines? finished moderna shot may. still ok? Seems like reports saying vaccines slightly effective now? Thanks!  That’s true. Population density poverty increased risk infection. everyone risk. Rand Paul testing limits far fingers placed ears right now. pandemic run Greek letters.  coming first world perspective. Many countries still need vaccines. Lots them. Time close boarders! California creasing Texas Biden needs stop letting people country 100,000 day. would've less thing president politicize it. No, r/fessus_intellectiva ...nice meet you. either forced pay surcharge Medicaid coworkers though covid joke showed camera footage first Italy surge. Anti-vaxxers thinking great many things... mean theoretically true. 

Protection wane still remain strong, especially depending define protection. Protection kind symptoms/infection, protection severe cases/hospitalization? 

I wouldn’t worry much. vaccinated, good protection. Booster shots could necessary, could overkill unless you’re part vulnerable group people. 

A lot people panic stuff, it’s good idea take step back realize you’re already protected protection good, studies boosters still preliminary best. Maybe shut boarders! keep getting exposed every day life body keep making anitbodies. highly contagious delta variant, chances vaccinated people going run body act, act quickly. hand vaccination pass doctor they'll tell need. plan fall I'm anyway flu vaccine. think need refreshers never know. wish federally elected politicians would hafta use local VA healthcare provider. think things would get better view this: business asks mask up, I'll mask up. need mask hop plane go somewhere, I'll it. I'm not, however, going live fear constantly mask to. understand risks, understand may see ""selfish"" keep worrying waiting cases go way down, life gonna pass us vaccinated folks up. 

My mom's getting younger. There's lot places seen. south safest place go right now? Absolutely not. wants see places south we're gonna go. We'll take right cautionary measures and, required mandated not, we're crowded indoor space we'll mask feel comfortable. holy hell, people shaming others returning life need get grip. reason Thailand reported cases fewer deaths? SMART! It’s nature viruses. always another variant. many experts weighed in, variant totally evade vaccine also unlikely able infect humans. I'm pro-pot good remember people authors (MRR, GR, LCN, DY JMM) filed provisional patent entitled “Method use Cannabidiol antiviral agent”. Receipt provisional patient *(sic)* acknowledged USPTO November 30, 2020. S.A.O. cofounder consultant OptiKira., L.L.C. (Cleveland, OH). I've heard mothers also pumping putting milk children's food (who breastfeeding age) Moderna much smaller company. might 18 months ago quickly gaining ground Pfizer.

Market cap moderna 165.63 billion, pfizer 251.42 billion. huge companies difference market cap free cash flow really justify little moderna supporting hard science around vaccine. somone moderna vaccnated I'm pretty disappointed rely pfizer studies make health decisions hope end close enough studies one apply both. Let’s let Darwin work Well shoot unvaccinated. Get going.  headache 50 days. I’m fine now, take indomethacin go steroids. scary stuff. wrong many words know. I’ll smile nod.

YMMV. Vaccination rates little measures necessary, comparing 70% 35%. measures would necessary anywhere there's lot cases, least unless vaccination rates 95% (which simply impossible vaccine children).

I’m random person online. Michaeljacksonpopcorngif see rich tourists them, defining characteristic extreme income inequality.

But rich folks able get vaccinated boutique clinics even population whole can't. fair course, reality. 

And tourism luxury.

Most people money spend tourists get vaccine access next months, already.

But access potential tourists remotely legitimate whine general population access still year whole quarter world. original variants vaccines close sterilizing immunity. Doctors literally articulated time, pretending like 95% wasn’t efficacy one time?

There’s first! “93% isn’t enough protection you! extra shot benefit”- Moderna results Florida Hospital Association member poll painted

Monday, poll showed 60 percent facilities expected  
“critical staffing shortage” next seven days. association’s

I'm quite bit concerned year. live NJ folks taking pretyy seriously around us least. y'all seriously allow post turn Trump comments. Please.   damage covid-19 seems immune system's inflammation response, rather virus itself. symptoms, implies inflammation, therefore probably suffering damage would went control.

What know, think still unclear general, mechanisms ""long covid"" could still happen asymptomatic infection without inflammation. Like, maybe virus gets lodged places release low level antigens time, one hypotheses kinds long covid. maybe get sort autoimmune disorder triggered immune response real virus even immune response quick effective never got inflammation? seen anything suggest either likely, doubt anyone knows real yet. response yesterday locally explained it. person young already statistically good chance fine. entire time they’ve gone eat, taken trips, stores, lived life unvaccinated unmasked yet get sick. view shot &amp; side effects worth they’re fine without it. Leads complete apathy people. Get annual semi-annual vaccines, updated Covid mutates.

We run serious risk Covid becoming persistent, annual disease - like flu. Except infectious dangerous. people ""choose"" get vaccine hospitals ""choose"" admit them. Same- covid, heart failure 2019. He's big old dude who's totally cavalier health, shocked made physical issues.

However, vent *fucked up* mentally. Totally traumatized him, says there's nothing avoid it. He's Florida, got vaccinated February. shocked- proactive health completely off-brand guy. 

If survival rate ventilation low, information much fuckin sucks might widespread persuasive.  vaccinated reason, welcomed here.

Not everyone get, even authorized get, current vaccines... pissed misinformation ignorance Right start this: yes, individual may healthy likely die Covid, easily spread healthcare system simply cannot accommodate everyone need medical attention virus left unchecked, obviously extending anyone needs go hospital reasons Covid well. Pay wall I’m saying is, would possible walk in, say it’s first shot, get another. aren’t keeping track centralized database. going it… yet, know people have. concerns. study seen far Argentina, around 250 people 65 older. Many extremely mild symptoms, loss smell, still suffered brain damage measured decreased cognitive function. Step 1: refuse vaccination

Step 2: refuse stop gap measures like sheltering masking

Step 3: get serious Covid

Step 4: bump someone’s scheduled nonurgent heart surgery can’t breathe

Step 5: someone’s heart surgery rescheduled months later complicated 

Step 6: survive permanent damage

Millions families facing potential eviction, unemployment / underemployment, Covid related deaths, fortunes medical expenses, inflation rise, describe economic fallout word “mild”? Im sure word means think means. 


I guess you’re part upper class society, hasn’t bad guess, stock markets still rallying despite above. vaccine free widely available implemented 2022, they’d year comply. Uber literally give free ride vaccine. Almost every pharmacy Walmart America shot. easy get vaccine now. 

My point even poor, getting shot 2022 issue. They’d one blame.  want personal responsibility health, get personal responsibly avoidable medial bills. waiting happen her. half population cares issue happens them. Doesn’t matter many suffer then.  “Haha, actively misleading situation!” gotcha think is. Anyone link recent data much vaccinated people shed infective viral particles versus non-vaccinated? “Australia alone banning citizens, temporary visa holders, permanent residents dual citizens leaving country international travel ban brought March 2020.

It also country temporarily threatened citizens threat jail massive fines tried return home India height recent COVID wave. Several Australians trying get home died India.” vaccinated? Congress enough covid deniers happen. Yep, definitely effect healthcare levels. wife severe chronic health issues, doctor always used make time see anytime called appointment, even meant stayed late day. Since COVID, capacity... working practice putting shifts small regional hospitals outlying rural areas understaffed. know Delta spread among vaccinated selective pressure towards vaccine resistance. 

You can't doomsday messages. ;)

If virus spreads among vaccinated, much selective pressure resist it. Yeah would like think delta changing discussion think last meeting back June knows point resources get strained, priority given patients likely survive.

Since covid low death rate proper treatment, patients going given priority. Thankfully, means vaccinated individuals get priority event crunch, also means people lethal conditions may triaged. Anecdotally know 5+ people (close friends + family) town vaccinated got covid still.  effective ""they us believe""; delta mutation happened variant became dominant. 

[And said    rate delta spread, strongly suspect everyone going get vaccinated not. Vaccinated much likely mild asymptomatic case though wont reported. ask id reject one. say insurance well. think important information needs known. Additional production capacity added year long. Absolutely everything done make much possible. Problem availability raw material, production equipment manpower anywhere. Also takes 2-3 months product vaccine line. terms saving lives keeping people hospitals it’s better give available doses first doses unvaccinated populations.

*The New York Times* cited numbers, although noted experts cautioned results fickle subject chance, assume clinical trials small (I think around 40k Pfizer, 30k Moderna). week, Pfizer BioNTech released detailed report mRNA vaccine’s durability six months. companies estimated vaccine’s efficacy started 96.2 percent first two months second dose. declined that, 83.7 percent six months.  experts cautioned calculated decline Pfizer-BioNTech study could statistical artifact. Chance alone could lead different efficacy estimate different times. “I would assume waning immunity based study alone,” said Maria Deloria Knoll, epidemiologist Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School Public Health.

I think I'm skeptical Moderna's claims, methodology data final six month analysis published far. think they'd outright lie investor briefing, there's room ambiguity given informality statements. also seems like potential ""statistical artifact"" experts warned *Times*' article could work either direction, either manufacturer...if they're saying Pfizer's results relied upon one study, seems likely Moderna's.

That’s cool, it’s fine disagree this. see differently. No, unfortunately little scientific literature comparing mRNA vaccines.

Additionally, CDF sense, ethically irreproachable Covid-19 vaccines available... morally acceptable receive Covid-19 vaccines used cell lines aborted fetuses research production process.

So Catholics certainly able receive vaccines. fifth point document go say time, practical reason makes evident vaccination isnot, rule, moral obligation that, therefore, must bevoluntary.

So yes, one forced get vaccine. ALSO goes say who, however, reasons conscience, refuse vaccines producedwith cell lines aborted fetuses, **must utmost avoid, byother prophylactic means appropriate behavior, becoming vehicles transmission infectious agent.** particular, mustavoid risk health cannot vaccinated formedical reasons, vulnerable.

In words, going get vaccinated, **must** avoid large public gatherings, wear mask appropriate times, avoid proximity people particularly vulnerable disease, etc. many anti-vaccine people hear see daily like ""I want get vaccinated I'm best protect others staying away wearing mask""? Basically none. line always like ""I'm going live life."" direct contradiction principles laid CDF document.

In words, going get vaccine obligation impose restrictions protect lives around you. ""vaccines mandatory:"" moral obligation protect health well around remains becomes significantly burdensome event choose to. think that's bit people forget ignore. I'm thinking mostly ignore, hear people talk, prideful self-centered language: ""**I'm** going live **my** life."" They're elevating selfish desires moral obligations neighbors.

Anyway, TED talk over. wanted provide additional clarification. consequences line developing countries prolong pandemic. one reason recommended.  ok go. Thank you. agree thats weird unnecessary abbreviation Canada surpassed us think I'm sure point trying make. article super vague exactly students provide get religious exemption, many places sign form saying opposition due religious beliefs. see anything article saying students prove reason exemption conforms particular definition ""religious belief"" anything like that, know argument want here. I'm pointing depending strict exemption, students may wiggle room think. No, called someone anti-vaxxer saying vaccines effective ""they"" say. anti-vaxxers say discourage vaccinations undermine effort. effective. Period. End discussion. Boo fucking hoo plenty people can't get vaccine. [That list questions answer getting help identify people may reaction FYI, antibodies covid may *present* human breast milk likelihood conferring protection infant unlikely due gut barrier.

Conferring immunity fetus different thing.  I'm left party exists country, dingus. reality stated. again, might not. Wish media would stop fear-mongering. bad enough worrying is, adding might be. thought idea many areas potential impact (physical, legal, medical, criminal etc.).
I keep hoping kind policy regarding either third shots boosters. Yeah, think I'm actually going two kids coming school year. Thankfully job still cautious still work home majority time, difficult manage two pre-teens. think happening Texas? lies spread vaccines COVID GOP? don’t understand medical professionals quitting like hell. government administration especially don’t care. fuck point living terrible asshole states? hope true! Moderna (getting second shot next week) makes feel much less stressed. Yeah, I'm definitely group boosters become necessary. Protection virus would drop pretty close zero I'd get another shot, I'd definitely get nasal booster whatever interval recommended. work lot better enough people actually take them. Based comment, I’m assuming you’re US? scientific point view sterilizing immunity wasn’t ever menu unfortunately. really feel bad media told otherwise… rejoice fact vaccines indeed effective protecting us illness death :) CenturyLink enters conversation… every Dollar Store. Problem solved! We’re still behind, hopefully get better. Instead rationing, address shortages additional manufacturing capacity. It’s going easy, probably better approach. Exactly. testing insane part. province ok vaccinations, areas province not. rural areas teens low twenty percent area fully vaccinated people. 

We lots lots people infect.

And government picking fight nurses. thank hard work past 2 years wage cut. reason support government free fall. (gasp) actually pay people living wage, something important, like taking care parents grandparents? we’re definitely going needing boosters soon. Again, staff start burnout breakdown . . . think peers Spectrum already disappeared, based terrible internet service 😄 move unvaccinated people eligible back list. Someone broken ankle deserves care people refuse help themselves. Plenty people little reaction. experience side effects either shot Moderna.  six months second dose getting little concerned. Especially traveling long distances. mean basic math. Even vaccine 85% efficiency, still 15% chance get it. Also vaccinated person enter many indoor places every time he/she encounter virus time, 15% possibility occur, that's herd immunity. transmission become slower, virus can't much even indoor places. hit herd immunity, case increases normal Today learned...

Vaccinee word.  P sure lambda got totally eradicated delta California bit ago.  What's secret? America. Unless America plans ban international travel, statement applies world. worries! Sorry triple post noticed. tried posting comment app first two times said 'something went wrong'. I'll delete extras. heard fish piss ocean   don’t understand everyone pushing vaccine. people don’t want it, shouldn’t forced take it. Let die eventually catch it. form. 

98% hospitalization. 

100% death. Yes, unfortunately. I’ve read aerosols stay air minutes 16 hours. look like CBD:THC 1:1 serum provided amount protection, significantly lower CBD alone. Would certainly need study. understand huge numbers unvaccinated, latest data Catalonia 63% unvaccinated hospitalizations, 73% unvaccinated ICU.

&amp;#x200B;

In fact count ICUs 70 older, there's vaccinated (67%) unvaccinated (33%) , makes sense since 6% 70 older unvaccinated.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess vaccination rate old people good? says Barbie natural? back hospital soon enough. needed break, medicine way requiring stay it. spent youth pursuing medicine, massive loans real marketable skills. working medicine foreseeable future, though saved enough go back school may switch careers.

Just throwing anyone may history eye inflammation wondering would greater risk vaccination. 

Does article actually claim real link vaccine? Eye inflammation happens many people daily. Lol already happening

They’re saying FDA review rushed political reasons Also declared ""much less issue"" delta long time too. ""Nothing worry about"" definitely doomsday. Tate Reeves, Mississippi governor, said ""No mask mandate Mississippi."" yesterday.  
Pro life ass.  don’t disagree you, say personal experience I’ve seen pretty egregious errors misleading contexts earnings release materials particular caught auditors. press release yes, number would feel pretty comfortable accuracy it. goes fairly extensive reviews checks internally externally, worst case context could misleading/is definitely meant emphasize company strength could glossing qualifying factors. ER performance snapshot anyway, it’s context required would still jump conclusions seeing actual study data. it’s slide deck no, I’ve seen sloppy mistakes made one client (fortune 50 size reputable accounting department) check curtesy, clients auditors check all. one client particular started curtesy check got called times analysts incorrect numbers ER decks. I’m saying that’s case number wouldn’t trust ER slide deck give full picture numbers far could throw tbh. Manufacturing capacity still extremely limited. AstraZeneca still struggling deliver many markets don’t get started J&amp;J. 

Novavax delayed many months due access raw materials production equipment. hope Hurricane season stays quiet. think memory cell response fine, antibodies mRNA vaccines evolve much newer SARS-COV2 variants seem produce 1200x virions almost half time. potentially overwhelming attack body needs time respond neutralizing antibodies memory.

Consequently, think we'll eventually face variant escapes vaccinated immunity. Sure sure. ""Reddit"" tongue cheek part. I've seen Facebook Instagram too. almost always white folk. 

""think it’s progressives providing “understandable excuse” vaccine hesitancy doesn’t make black antivaxxer seem crazy white antivaxxers.""

Exact this, yeah. can't consistebtly make argument policies disproportionally affect minorities, even indirectly, bad think good idea. totally inconsistent. one main arguments voter ID years. pointing glaringly obvious Protection fade 6 months. That's means. Dallas County already Red. puts two largest cities Texas highest threat levels. 

The governor supposedly believes freedom won’t give counties freedom make rules.

Mask mandates forbidden. Required vaccines forbidden entities receive state funding. Schools open next week vaccines 12, masks, distancing.

It’s scary right now, state led heavily comprised luddites everything power prevent safety measures put place. Check figure 2 study. found in-vivo studies CBD produced significant antiviral effects, cannabinoids produced even remotely similar effect, 1:1 mixture THC:CBD reduced efficacy CBD serum substantially (though still serums include CBD). sounds like husband wants excuse stay beach he’s listening them. want extra safe, could get second test comes home. likely home since unvaccinated, though, don’t see logic. r/relationship_advice anything, husband man child. last minute parents decided test results acceptable, ""asked"" remain next Monday, full 10 days post ""possible exposure"" believe test results still think transmit it.

His parents get dictate movements anymore. they're worried getting (which said super unlikely) see 10-day period. sure why/how/where husband comes this. J&amp;J here. Cheering y’all sidelines guess. antibodies entire story. much going body antiviral response. body builds proteins actually directly respond destroy coronavirus particles enter you, amount antibodies nearly bearing that. news done extremely terrible job reporting explaining surprise considering Moderna majority US

Is it? think so. ""go get another dose""? check? Honestly demonization people ""different"" fit typical societal ""norms"" nothing new. Whether introversion, anti vax , LGBTQ etc. society always find way attack understand. shut-down again? It’s almost time go back office I’d rather lounge home. sums we’re mental gymnastics really dig find compassion right now. hospitals apart GPOs, unlike media conglomerates. Even better, lots foreign money US healthcare.

Good, cull ignorant try sides corona virus response? specify died. possible unlucky group young relatively young people died vaccines available. 0% chance NC  yeah vaccinated issues like heart, cancer, liver, kidneys etc. people deprioritized unvaccinated COVID patients. suspect lying save embarrassment. Nothing letter says it’s religious requirement. It’s personal belief allowing co-signed religious belief  FDA seems position whatsoever children. stated concerns existing studies want kids added last minute dragging things out. suspect not. 6 months real world pfizer began lose efficacy. Pfizer vaccine large pool real world data (israel) gives pretty much instant feedback. Moderna going end pretty much pfizer.   biggest stuff date UK points a50% reduction among vaccinated individuals, I’d assume mostly symptomatic cases. know vaccinated likely asymptotic. 

But yeah, data needed. far, good, though surprise considering Moderna majority US. Pfizer dominant EU. Iowan here, sure attending year despite asked work concessions. doesn’t seem worth even getting paid little handle all.  Thanks. Darn area. tend agree sentiment.
 
For part politicians opportunists salespeople. find angle work pander gains power. Pandering 'sickening, hideous part us seeks selfish inconsiderate anyone’s well own' seems solid play world today... saying antibodies wane 6 months. 6 months would course winter. track? Yes people don’t understand. cousin 29 years old got covid back Feb/March hospitalized. recovered antibody infusion less 4 months later found dead apartment. died sleep. 29. doubt Covid weakened organs. firmly believe would still alive hadn’t severe case covid. know it’s pure speculation makes sense me. sucks since toddler little wear mask (he keep on) 2 years old understand concept. Except turn people away, go back population others exposed them. could still get Covid, legitimate question, ""Can vaccinated person could next variant, maybe one makes vaccines null void?""

I mean I'm planning living life, I'll still taking precautions anyone outside small bubble.

Still masking distancing gathering indoors. important part businesses playing ""required"" card, FDA approval helps make decision easier them. Even hardened anti-vaxxers begrudgingly get poked gonna cost job to.  don’t get vaccinated. thing people doing? figured boosters might thing honestly hadn’t heard anything specific people going back second doses yet (assuming might change given news). Try participate fewer personal attacks next time. Anecdotes science either. company said 100% effective breakthroughs happen. That's need mask populated indoor areas variant thing. thankful deal thanks vaccine. could much worse. many places without pharmacies. live now, it’s 45 minute drive walgreens, cvs, similar chain. didn’t car, wouldn’t able get there- bus routes leave town. 

When lived Alaska, traveling pharmacy would involved 30 minute taxi 2 hour flight cost around 350$.  No, they'll invent additional conspiracy theories avoid reality. We've seen everything else harms children. isnt literally already existing data shows moderna performing better pfizer terms long term immunity? 

I know two vaxxed people caught covid recently, got Pfizer. Title misleading. Pretty much variants show level vaccine resistance. feel like somehow involves family members... comes antibodies illnesses contract lives get vaccinated for, many passed baby provide protection several months, even longer. Breastfeeding, breastfeeding longer period time, provides passive antibody protection many illnesses. appears antibodies COVID-19 also pass baby though passive immunity, whether vaccinated pregnancy, antibodies natural infection. would count antibodies natural infection alone, course.

They usually require ID bill insurance. They're supposed to, CVS Walgreens usually do.

Also, look placement CVS Walgreens locations, find generally poor neighborhoods.

Basically anywhere mid-winter early 2022.

    really, still preferable get sick first place need treated it.   joke, I'm telling state GA would nation's lowest positivity rate CFA this. 3 severe cases hundreds millions vaccinations seems fine me, especially since even worst outcomes easily treated. happens use vaccine many people diverse health profiles; eventually come across side effects. fact critical ones reported point speaks volumes safety shot. Even heart inflammation treatable.   neighbor like this. says make appointment, never seems get around it. believe polite way hide anti-vax views something. get either. gently push every again, else do? Fortunately, Malaysia fastest vaccination rate world. kinda expect number go soon, least less people severe complication. Unless..., current govt decide use daily cases ulterior motives since political crisis right now.  Yep, get saying! FYI, applying formula reverse Rt (same V) would equal P 60%, 85% Delta. 

Probably meaningless numbers due many factors could influencing it, interesting. sick. None got close dying. young heathy. Eat well exercise hour day. helps prime body. It’s overweight unhealthy getting destroyed this. Also older people I’ve heard pharmacies giving shots kids turning 12 year, 11 year olds. 200,000 seems like lot, individual pharmacists making judgement calls knows else deciding “basically same” 12 year old. Quickly perusing things, appears numerous ""studies"" serious methodological concerns. study mentioned article completed end January see similar articles dated far back February. Unfortunately, one still peer reviewed.  chest pains couple days second Moderna dose. worrisome. kids fall 5-11 group.

I wish could answer better, non-HFD people life denying reality Covid-19 gone silent and/or blocked social media. vaccine, hundreds HFD members getting infected it, turned huge staffing issue, meant lots overtime people like me. also killed 3 members. Unfortunately me, contracted first dose vaccine, awful. work month. wife two kids got well. kids handled fine. maybe 3 4 days dry cough fever. wife work 4 months recovering wound quitting job teacher. wife yet return energy pandemic. 

The thing bothers medical people denying it, promoting “dangers” vaccine. I’m talking 1 nurse 1 doctor. know other. That’s disturbing non-medical people buying crap. understand worked hard get education experience had. too. delusional part think makes expert *everything.*

The frustrating part suburban rural hospitals surrounding Houston overloaded now, too. get new patient needs hospitalized, think send them? guessed nearest big city, you’d 100% correct.

Fwiw opinion, makes sense boost, least certain segments population, going fall winter. time, antibodies wane eventually need fourth doses? Yearly boosters? Maybe. I’m yearly booster, become less necessity think (I know asking third doses, know people jump right well going every six 12 months thing?).  FDA Approved Covid-19. I've told that's matters.


It's even approved EUA Covid-19. They’re gonna run outta Greek letters.   real un from

Further, specifically discussing 24% respondents replied never planned get vaccine. survey didn’t give option answer “microchips.” group almost equally split “I don’t trust vaccine” “I don’t believe vaccine even necessary.” 

 good news people informed get vaccine, doesn’t magically mean aren’t afraid due antivax rhetoric propaganda.

So, period time, 97.5% COVID deaths unvaccinated individuals. would impressive itself, becomes even note old people vaccinated first. quite six-month period, ""vaccinated person"" meant exclusively someone 65. vaccine offered little protection serious COVID, death ratio high opposite direction — old people likely get vaccinated, vaccine work, therefore almost everyone dies vaccinated. fact opposite true real story, need fallaciously use total vaccinated population denominator tell it. come Sarah Gilbert said covid-19 variant entirely evade vaccine far serious disease goes fine.

Oh look, consequences inactions. Same. Probably would gotten covid. Would worked death bunch ungrateful conspiracy theorists. Sounds like CYA speak. knows failed getting vaccine want admit choices. True, government can't force receiving vaccine, constitutional state vaccine mandate penalty (fine and/or jail time) non-compliance. smallpox-era Supreme Court case *Jacobson v. Massachusetts* (and others) established this. (Note state demonstrate appropriate public health danger, can't willy-nilly decide require random injection. )

Any state could impose mandate wanted to. clear whether Federal government would authority though.  short sighted time. went data had. regret choice. Also, see edit made original comment. potentially good news bad news recently reported  Weird, late 20s neither Moderna shot hit hard, bit sore arm light headache, that's Elective surgery etc That's correct, one dose enough.

Anecdotally, know someone tested positive Monday, symptoms slight sniffles. spent entire weekend friends bachelorette, every single person tested negative. 

Eleven people, vaccinated, one tested positive minor symptoms, ten others tested negative five days later.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* You’re right. that’s I’m angry CDC well selfish idiots refuse part. 

And people don’t live think we’re bunch morons know big cities mask mandates hell lot people complied, everyone family sacrificed, also got vaccinated. 

It’s “well let Florida die then” hospitals fill. millions people horrified except live here. That's got term ""errybody"" from. It’s almost obese people higher risk poor health outcomes…

Weird. many ICU beds total? Talk pediatrician. Tell exactly said get advice. asking random strangers internet help make decision goes bad could cost kid life leave disabled. would probably fine, damn, I'd asking child's doctor experts advanced degrees relevant fields. Yeah still get covid even fully vaccinated, surprise. Especially wore masks outdoor picnic blanket spacing event seem unreasonable. sparse could drop masks.

It's crowd concern. Keep incidentals like restrooms everyone trying file walkway parking lot mind, definitely bring masks might caught that.

Also probably make 5-10x difference risk plus side, hospitals announced -- going refuse unvaccinated patients even hit capacity limits -- would probably motivate LOT people get vaccinated.  earth would vaccinated person “shed infective viral particles?” vaccines contain live viruses - there’s nothing shed.

[Viral Shedding COVID-19 — Can’t doubt sincere (because “shedding” 100% term used conspiracy theorists, people informed Covid) mean *infected* vaccinated person vs *infected* non-vaccinated person? do, [here’s references several published, peer-reviewed studies. Delta may bit different ([info Luckily vaccines drastically reduce severe symptoms hospitalization (and thus cost public health care system, even nut jobs among us want many people possible vaccinated.) course evidence suggests vaccines reduce chance someone infected first place (and thus chance would infect someone else.)

If trying make argument vaccines and/or vaccine passports (it’s clear point is) find different approach one nonsensical. There's little mechanism return doses back federal government distributed. choice throwing expiring doses third shot, donating option, go booster large chunk Canada mixed moderna + pfizer shots. problems there. includes myself. Shit, giant magnet flew face women. develop condition called pregnancy. month long shut buy us month come back shutdown? spread again? Lots intelligent well informed Floridians. trying survive here. Scotland vaccinated 91% aged 18 least one dose, England reached 89% Northern Ireland 84%.”

With Delta horizon US I’d feel much comfortable UK’s vaccination rates. No, article saying they’ll less effective preventing infection time we’ll need booster winter. Still helps preventing infection top hospitalization death, doesn’t prevent infection 100% time effectiveness may wane time.  That's true. correlation severity side effects efficacy vaccination. different part immune system, adaptive part, reacts vaccine. side effects people experience come part immune system born with. Every immune system reacts different. OK! Yes, can. extrapolate CDC data (their estimate 5% infections overall resulting hospitalization, ratio child hospitalizations per capita ages per capita), works 1 320 infected children hospitalized.

[There's UK NHS showing nearly quarter hospitalizations, though, people hospitalized something else happening covid positive (some amount inevitable much population infected), though article linked state previous one failed bookmark said number even higher (I think recall 1 3) among children.

Apply corrections, 1 every 425 480 infected children would end hospitalized. negligible amount, also *super* scary amount. Make will. bs. Now, people burying heads sand getting vaccinated, taking beds away patients need them. mention amount money spent many people get covid need hospitalized won’t get damn shot! I'm going back assumption tested. Nothing currently put forward, youre coming late slinging mud feel superior. Again, suck. got capacity many leave got biggest raise ive ever seen. keep people stay on, hiring mess due covid staff short something drastic. shocked tells going new norm while. enough staff, wayyyyy much work. one wants stay on, new hires ive talked miserable even higher pay. much work us balance, supposed way. Baloney. live here. big cities mask mandates recently. DeSantis removed local ability *enforce* mandates, make them. Despite local law teeth, vast majority people kept masking store policy follow local law CDC guidelines. CDC said vaccinated throw caution wind despite data delta looming horizon.

How could local counties mask mandate, even toothless one, CDC said fine? authority could back law? Listen science that, right?

Oh sure, went grocery store said unvaccinated still wear masks. Oh clever, CDC. amazing. 95% people inside maskless place 50% vaccinated. 

Fuck CDC. last bit authority standing us virus. virus actually spreading unchecked first time Florida, despite representations contrary. 73.5% fully vaccinated adults UK vs 60.8%, also vaccinating 12-17 year olds UK isn't, point still holds true.  Similar first second shot. Sore arm, tired… Also likely see varying regional peaks. Primarily due climate.

I mean, also get resistance restrictions damage mental health whole thing left us with. want normal back too. vaccine huge path towards getting it. Even believe social distancing, least heavily vaccinated young population likely still significantly reduce transmission risks. fully vaccinated nightclub still much better chance mass outbreak unvaccinated one. UK literally went “fully open” two days cases surprisingly peaked plummeted back Shocking. else expect happen?! strange thing that, locally Arkansas, years ago actual flu going around, quite high school students sick days, every days getting worse. Parents begging schools close couple weeks. let flu burn whoever give kids chance avoid it. belief many would days anyway, sick. last cold flu season obvious mask mandate would helped keep kids schools.


But several states able implement future. right answer. vaccine working!! :)

Definitely far cry better flu vaccine worked us early 2020. whole family gets flu shot every year Feb 2020 got flu (got checked COVID antibodies May 2020, nada). Knocked us asses week so. Unlikely reinfected, possible. Dude, early proponent masks distancing. believed strongly based data needed strong NPIs medical measures. pushed local government ramp policies early. Don’t tell I’m COVID denial. 

But we’re going say “trust science” “follow science” need whether it’s convenient views. 

I believe 100% number deaths accurate. believe 100% it’s severe dangerous illness (mostly adults.) we’re going start doubting literally every journal health authority reporting impact kids minimal we’re bad thinking Trumpists. 

So think UK, Canada, Australia also lying? I’m convinced third shot much. Pfizer trialed third shot phase 2 found significant change immune response beyond second shot. might provide temporary boost antibodies could bring absolute infections it’s long term solution. Nice. date sorry :D know vaccines already reached us Europe hope happen fast important! I'll take ""comments aged like milk come Halloween"" 500! doctor literally advised get vaccinated it’s without doubt rare case.

I also mindset literally anyone get vaccinated should. saying understand. anything perfect? No. 

Getting vaccine 💯 hell lot safer getting Covid. sooner get herd immunity, possible thru vaccination, sooner move lives.

I vaccinated, worn mask last 20 months, want everyone safe.

With rights come responsibilities seems forgotten.

We point don’t increase vaccination rates could see vaccine resistant variant appear start again.

Over next months going watch tens thousands hundreds thousands people die.

We need people vaccinated, need clarify messaging need reform healthcare system disaster. 

Our healthcare workers stressed af end sight. It’s ridiculous Slime Lord Kenney outsource rapid testing buds make money. 19,000 cases age group 135 hospital, means 99.992% hospitalized. 

To that's pretty important number especially Florida fuck show, masks, etc. 

Makes feel WAY better daughter starting kindergarten liberal bubble mask wearing. reactions? questions? get yet? DeSantis guilty. Office/tech Amazon reputation expecting answer email 3:30 within 5 minutes. say ""have asthma.""

But really true. Live low pollen, low ozone, non-polluted area going see much much lower effects asthma.

I see blaming one finding pristine area asthma much different blaming one over-prescribed opioids. zero input zero patient doctor control 

I think diseases really truly fit category relatively small. diseases still struggle costs Healthcare system go inputs. Take cancer. We've got lists known carcinogens. 

Heart disease? know plenty saturated fats fats help it.

This far spectrum black white think really drawing lines probably based prejudice. ""People drugs smoke weak character.""

Like, really, want bust someone taking drugs 14 year old abused father devastating car crash resulted months surgeries pain? I'm least trying discourse. Coming ""an educated person"" back handed cheap. adding discourse, dissonance.  Masks politicized. 
Neither vaccines. 

Seriously talk doctor. Ask questions. Make decision. Keep move on.  35,000,000 * (0.05%/100) = 17,500.
If death rate 2%, it’s:
35,000,000 * (2%/100) = 700,000. let get straight - polio Vaccine required one jab. Chicken POx - ONE JAB.

Covid? Requires THREE, last SIX MONTHS.

Yeah vunts lying something forget hospital bill. survive still screwed good insurance.. takeaway reading this: Myocarditis, 6x common getting covid getting vaccinated, still vanishingly rare cases really symptom major concern. 

The fact easily concerning vaccine side effect, yet still roughly ""die drinking tapwater""-tier rare big red arrow pointing ""GET VACCINATED"" sign though.

Get vaccinated! Oh, know :) Yeah we're pretty darn vaccinated, herd immunity vaccinated everything open. Nowhere suggest such. “Research suggests.” Based username Good thought, probably agree people stay safe (masks, social distancing) higher chance getting COVID people do. one family either COVID antibodies time took vaccine.

Regardless, 1% probably unrealistic, even per year. Note per year enough (as opposed lifetime probability) every year would getting booster, odds *should* cancel lifetime unless either COVID vaccines got much worse (or better) giving people myocarditis.

The point 1% OP used example, using extreme numbers. 0.1% (vaccine) vs 10% (COVID) absolutely unrealistic anyway given article linked guesses 6x higher, 100x higher. risk COVID per year **16.6%**, based articles assumptions, better getting vaccine. Gives income they're unable work elementary age kids stay home. got voted mentioning 16% number:

Data released Health Ministry Thursday suggested people vaccinated January said 16% protection infection now, vaccinated April effectiveness 75% Right, two Morderna shots like 1 mont apart. Got first dose back April 3 second one first May.

Not sure would need another one soon two last good time. boom is. places fine high vaccination rates. low vax masking rates states, model us peaking next month Oct.

How long Florida bands practice? Yes softens impact virus, doesnt stop getting it.
Anyone actually read vaccine guess? It’s also wide variety people, lot diverse backgrounds. media, people general like portray terms politics. People left pro vax, people right anti vax. couldn’t truth. lot hard left people I’ve encountered adamant getting vaxxed. There’s million reasons people wanting get shot. It’s intellectually dishonest paint left vs right issue. prioritize times like these. Folks get vaccinated instead coming manner stupid hypotheticals. mean I've wearing KN95 common areas, gym NOBODY wearing masks since June 15th I'm seeing anyone mask inside gym. medium sized gym they've got fans blowing stuff, open 24/7. I've going time either empty, there's maybe 2-4 people even near me...

Based reply, I'm getting sense ALWAYS masked KN95, skip others wearing one, fact complex made clear definitely concerning.

Hoping they're going require proof vaccination, appointment temperature checks, weird hours, etc. vaccine injected muscle. Pretty hard miss, impossible. Look hospital figures. I'm one advocate illicit drug use, anecdotal reports people restoring lost sense taste smell single dose LSD. Florida gov saying withhold funding school makes kids wear masks. want blaze through. care. specifically want spread. address first point, easy look medical record. “friend” doesn’t get vaccine rare medical condition, would reflect chart. 

I agree second point, lot medical distrust particularly minorities well mass disinformation campaigns affecting primarily republicans. time, feel time patient over. It’s starting affect healthcare workers. Without healthcare professional intimate, none matters. Explain anti-vaccination, causing person likely hospitalized due covid, illegal insurance.  Absolutely, already seen many studies damage lungs/heart brain. hoping everyone's sake stuff exclusive severe cases, vaccine definitely amazing job preventing. One person traveled foot grave already due smoking/age, somehow survived case thankfully.

But one situations would much liked ever gotten it, chance damaging body turned damage mild cases.  results mixed P&amp;M shots? news, next Covid-19 variant around corner. Well understand Israel bringing back restrictions, it’s disheartening see many vaccinated people hospitalized.

Guys, based this, even everyone vaxxed don’t think it’ll possible live Covid without restrictions. passed times get blood drawn get drawn regularly. Getting IVs put makes incredibly nauseous. get incredibly anxious sweaty shots.

I one first people get vaccine even comfort knowing hundreds millions people already significant side effects.

Suck up. Look away person giving shot hardly even notice happened.

My phobia long COVID. almost like want Federal mandate U.S. Tax funded schools masked.  know angry but... no. Healthcare workers assess treat medical issues, morality patients. Whatever they/you/anyone thinks patient deserves deserve, belong medicine. They'll prioritized based urgency care required chance survival without it.

I know why.

But correct, often make seem like mostly elderly c0nservativƐs refusing vaccines numbers show largely young adults supposedly left leaning, diverse educated generation. think way ensure uptake group require vaccines schools, including colleges universities. That's young people are. one, big one. saw 3-4%, that's would ""well, small things"". 10+%? major thing, republican leaders COULD throw weight behind getting vaccine, allowing mask mandates needed etc. help. don't, really idea why.

Dying concern. wonder registering? read it. Anything want point out?

People claiming Delta leaves quickly arrives. stall 30k shows that's wrong.

What changed school ended year.  Dude, seriously. PLEASE stop commenting ln promoting ideas things seem clue on. 

Most (almost all) seriously ill people age 60. let’s crude maths. 90% 60 vaccinated. use figures *60% seriously ill vaccinated* *90% vaccinated overall*, have:

”Rate” serious illness:

Vaccinated: 0.6/0.9=0.667

Unvaccinated: 0.4/0.1=4

Vaccine efficiency: 1-0.667/4=0.833=83.3%

So implies vaccine efficiency ~85% serious illness. Now, number vaccinated (90%) probably higher, consider even older people likely vaccinated *and* likely fall seriously ill, vaccine efficiency goes even higher. 

Now know math crude entirely correct, shows general idea. numbers they’re reporting headline says *absolutely nothing* without proper context. media chooses report things, it’s shameful. I’m sorry come across harsh, people swallow fearmongering idiots. Good luck (and mean it)  Well states trying really really hard help kids catch it. reads like apology: ""DO's *are simply forced* learn mystic claptrap mean practice it. go motions learn way get MD difficult world. slim majority even use they're school. probably okay seeing DO, least 57% time.""

I dispute facts yet think point stands firmly unassailed apology.

Your fighter pilot analogy notwithstanding: someone holding had, one point lives training, earnestly pursued OMT, calls judgement question. view justifies bias them. Fighter pilots forced wave crystals airplanes appease Navigation Gods -- I'm sure would question getting aircrafts.

Well UK stats 4th &amp; 5th August show new rise numbers. pull New Zealand little victory jig yet began clinical trials 2020. case I'm fucked 😑 cancer wind turbines, millions dead birds everywhere?

The list goes agree reasonable well defined penalties... ""Do smoke?"" literally got away preexisting conditions costing people more. example, pregnancy preexisting condition.

Ultimately, certain vaccines mandatory participation society healthcare universal contributed via taxes. This! country started rolling third doses. England, Germany, Israel. drop 0% 7 months. one cares us anymore man

Throughout pandemic, cared kids admitted covid-19 children’s hospital Houston pediatrician. children included newborns fevers require sepsis evaluation, school-age kids whose bodies ravaged inflammation associated covid-19 children, tweens adolescents covid pneumonia need oxygen respiratory support. I’ve cared children whose entire families devastated covid — sometimes child sick enough admitted parent bedside parents critically ill adult hospital street or, worse, recently died covid.
 
All while, doctor mother, I’ve wrestled certain dissonance: popular notion covid doesn’t affect children — public health epidemiologic training reminds population level, it’s true. majority children contract covid-19 asymptomatic mild disease. contrast reality clinician bedside children critically ill covid covid-related illnesses. two perspectives battle brain make risk assessments school-age child. One thing terrifies parent can’t predict children get incredibly sick covid others mild disease; don’t know go lingering debilitation symptoms months, others make quick recoveries.
 
What know moment, highly contagious delta variant becomes predominant strain circulating enter another covid surge, worried children ever been.

First foremost, high transmissibility delta variant translate greater number children exposed before, lead greater number children infected. Even delta variant virulent children original virus was, sheer numbers translate children admitted hospital covid covid-related illnesses. school reopenings coincide growth delta variant, worry see large outbreaks school settings didn’t see less-contagious versions virus.

I wonder, people saw see patients’ bedsides, would protect children? talked one mother wondered whether could done something prevent child ending sick hospital covid. recall providing emotional support — addition oxygen, steroids remdesivir — teenager admitted covid pneumonia grappling recent deaths multiple family members covid. life turned upside short weeks.

Over course pandemic, hospital system diagnosed 15,000 children adolescents covid — number trending up. 10 percent required hospital admission. one-third children admitted hospital required critical care — including oxygen delivered high-flow nasal cannula, noninvasive ventilation, intubation mechanical ventilation. discharge children hospital, know many long road recovery, many require follow-up cardiac clearance long-term care hospital’s long-covid clinic. 300 children across United States died covid since beginning pandemic, according Centers Disease Control Prevention. children covid make complete recovery, 10 percent, including mild illness requiring hospital admission, go develop months-long symptoms long covid.

During previous covid surges, children’s hospitals United States experienced low patient volumes compared prior years people seeking routine medical care elective procedures. could easily handle influx children covid also seeing much common viruses childhood, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) influenza, typically keep children’s hospitals busy winter. previous surges, children’s hospitals across country able serve pop-off valves adult hospitals overwhelmed covid admissions, many instances stepping admit provide direct clinical care adult patients, lending equipment adult hospitals.

What’s different time children’s hospitals also dealing unusual summertime surge respiratory viruses, including RSV, causes acute illness infants toddlers. hospitals seeing huge, sustained influx patients RSV — often need oxygen respiratory support — busier baseline times pandemic. worry children’s hospitals handle covid surge top RSV surge, stress hospital systems staff.

Adding concerns pediatrician society dealing covid fatigue. Children younger 12 remain ineligible vaccination, people tired following mitigation measures eager get back normal life. many eligible adults adolescents 12 years age remain unvaccinated. One important step families take protect children ages ensure eligible household members age 12 vaccinated; heartbreaking care children hospitalized covid know could prevented.

I often approached friends, family members neighbors facing difficult decisions also face pandemic parent: keep children safe? like remind past 18 months, we’ve gained experience knowledge developed tools recommendations help limit spread covid — based scientific evidence. Masking (including universal masking schools), physical distancing, testing, contact tracing, quarantining vaccinating help. abandon crucial tools now, putting children harm’s way. Arkansas Alabama , else needs said Austin announced Travis County, includes Austin, highest level. furious people endangered… vaxxed getting pissed. gonna make hissy fits anti-Vaxxers look like small potatoes. yet, taking prednisone antibiotics, im hoping vaccines help fight thing three kinds men. ones learn readin’. learn observation. rest pee electric fence themselves.

What make sense 2020 many would expected die (from cause) many did. Then, say confidently X (likely ballpark 500k) died US causes related COVID-19. 
 
Anyway, case, maybe best % hospitalized vaccinated vs area population vaccinated % fatalities vaccinated vs area population vaccinated. judgement. think feel great one done prior trip. Plenty places vaccine available United States. need help finding place get vaccinated?  seem completely fabricated, definitely proof much increased Hospital traffic Wuhan prior 2020. realize doctors hospital got sick Institute Virology tested found new covid genome, scientists found covid genome compared sick doctors hospital. little distinction order means virus originated near hospital, scientists sequenced genome first, original Well, obviously doesn’t answer question. Get one MRNA cancel Vegas trip. Honestly rudimentary math february last year come situation going see fewer 200,000 deaths, thought something horribly wrong going insane. 

No. right. lied half country everything possible make things worse.

I even got dogpiled times forum dozen deaths saying ""even I'm half crazy, we're still going see 100,000 people die"". Nobody wanted hear it. want hear it. us little voice telling us fuck neighbor, selfish, get someone beats us it…

I... Really though. I'm trying ""oh look me, I'm good person"" I'm not. 

But use casual version ""better get mine someone beats it"", I'm type pass items everyone else get mine run do, I'm happy one take hit getting whatever order make sure everyone else get theirs. 

Most people know same. Maybe hang ""right"" crowd, would say among people know, mindset general rule, exception. even little kid.

I think ""human"" selfish. think people learn take, learn step others learn put first way learn racist. may learn behavior early life, still learned behavior. Seven days ago reported 17,000 new cases, expect go coming days. sympathy goes health care workers dealing certain governor continues stand way. gotta get attention somehow... stupid facial hair ain't enough.  It’s common point confusion, Texas “County Judge” elected non-judicial position—basically they’re chief executive officer county. yeah either, shit toxic af Source? There's fucking playbook virus. learning fly. Since March 2020 always one possible outcome. I'm saying 100% going happen, even 1%. possible. scientist BELIEVE able create vaccines mutations? Sure. KNOW? No. one knows. That's point. know. important knock fucker out. reading post, anger particular woman slightly cooled. anti-vaxx, procrastinated. 

I still real sympathy - every pharmacy walk vaccinations available, doctor's office asked vaccinated last time went something unrelated, Google Maps recommends vaccine sites every time open something else, Alexa recommended last time used one, I'm getting cards mail... freakin everywhere wants give vaccine. I'm angry.

But tired kind story. tired hearing people got COVID wish done something different. **Of course** wish done something different. spent last year living fear position - laying hospital bed watching funeral loved one died brought COVID life. took fear turned action - worked home, chased medical grade masks (KN95's available), shopped hours, limited social activities, built home gym... anything everything could protect others. miracle protection, vaccine that's effective right be... people turning deciding safe go back old routines without taking precautions.

Sometimes think virus winning. I'm pretty sure right win given *fucking moronic* we're being. course. things going look 2 weeks, month kids take virus others? kids can’t get vaccinated spreads others unvaccinated. experiment makes sense.  get long term side effects drugg take twice. never happened never will.
You get long term side effects take drug long time.
Sleeping pills example. cannot sleep without them.

That's case vaccine. I'm sure boosters coming enough applications long term side effects. sure getting breakthrough rate .004% even studies led approval higher rate that's also considering delta variant. put context, US 10,000 new daily cases late June Arkansas Midwest here. 2 nurses walk job last night. Several putting notices soon. I’m dip. I’m 2020 again.  Pfizer study found 84%? could probably find again. confirm that’s you’re go looking seems like promising news! Well personally think not. get sicker vs vaccinated cause worse mutations though. 

And think matter dying living anyway. problem people get sick longer longer work it. thousands people working already months probably longcovid get tried two steps. become bigger problem future. dead people can't work, sick people can't either. unvaccinated individual. want alter life all.

“In 2020, covid vaccines, major private insurers waived patient payments — coinsurance deductibles — covid treatment. many allowed policy lapse. Aetna, example, ended policy Feb. 28; UnitedHealthcare began rolling back waivers late last year ended end March.

For reason, there’s logic behind insurers’ waiver rollback: patients kept financially unharmed preventable hospitalization, thanks vaccine government paid made available free charge? many drugstores, it’s popping highway rest stops bus stops, delivered administered home parts country.” would argue it’s framing issue say vaccines 95% effective (90% claimed delta iirc) protecting infected covid you’re taking total number people vaccinated 5% get it

i believe number changes quite bit someone exposed

So long &lt;100% world vaccinated long evolution thing, never zero COVID cases always another variant. look forward 2-3 month mask-free windows downslope every surge, followed another seasonal uptick mask mandates come back panic.

Doesn't take much 2038 whole generation grown normal. We're already like 8% way there.

Since people getting seriously sick selected sub group, different stats may apply. top that, big feature Delta variant high R0 number... people getting sick faster means pressure health care services, reach breaking point could also increase number deaths involved.

That's mine is, can't taste anything taste feels, weird. prompted even post originally i'd finished Chinese takeaway taste right someone else taste said lovely. Speaking US, 58% total population 70% adult population least one vaccine dose makes HUGE difference ultimate course pandemic compared world without vaccines. Actually fatality rate covid US around 1.7 %

This happens people politicize public health, children, immunocompromised, elderly end paying price. :/ think criteria changed much. still three categories, roughly defined presence/absence symptoms presence/absence diagnostic test.

I know reading document correctly. concern epidemiological component ""suspected case"" definition, might carry ""confirmed case"" definition? know that's correct reading, epidemic longer centered Wuhan, certain epidemiological link Wuhan required. might still epidemiological criterion ""suspected cases,"" certain requirement carry ""confirmed cases."" saw general guideline one two weeks spike positive cases spike hospital admissions. Mid-August going rough, happens, positive cases still upswing. Same. sister bad reaction J&amp;J, says wouldn’t get booster. know others said taking J&amp;J. reaction either shot Pfizer, even sore arm I’d get booster yesterday could. I’m hoping I’ll able convince take boosters become available. models suggest “as many 35 million Americans may get infected next couple months, next months,” according pandemic expert.

Some models suggest this, however, IMO models realistic. key issue one estimate many unvaccinated already caught covid therefore natural immunity. one thinks number low, say 5%, 35 million becomes reasonable number. However, one assumes number much higher, say 50%, 35 million realistic all.

To sure, nobody really knows, everybody guessing, intuition tells 18 months pandemic number likely closer 50% 5%. Exactly. Delta top dog moment. Nothing else kicking around currently looks like outcompete Delta.

Will see next months holds, comes swamps Florida.  wasn’t talking journalistic stylings. pulled excerpt quote doctor. well examples quotes.

Yeah sure that’s part too. stuff dealing breakthrough hospitalizations I’ve seen CDC put number around 25% hospitalized cases another reason happened test positive. that’s ages. feel little crappy / get cough, maybe sniffles days, get better. case vast majority 'breakthrough' infections. someone ended Covid last year even social distancing etc (and got vaxxed April Pfizer): congrats getting vaxxed! ways might feel “safer” nothing/not get vaxxed, Delta running around want end Covid. someone Covid- wish able access vaccine back 2020.

The CDC's goals primarily aligned public health interests always lead great advise preserving personal health. 

IMHO get vaccinated, wear mask, keep eye booster shot efficacy. wait CDC say good idea. Look data see makes sense circumstance. Talk doctor hold account answer. TBF, side argument, immunocompromised likely hosts generate new variants.

However ate right hospital antivaxxers. 

But blame motivation antivaxxers slightly governments indeed stated young people risk. attitude vaccinating fed little atleast. obvious people give shit people.. talking retrospect wanting sound dumb imo. guess got sick, saying thing friends. family too. mom thought cold lost taste smell. tested positive, wife also tested positive week later. days later baby (he's fine now) me. dad probably it, thought cold week before, get tested mom did. 

We congested sinuses days, bad. us vaccinated (I think Moderna, parents might Pfizer) except baby. ""imagine bad..."" , scary think about

It's game situation wife China &amp; January/February 2020. (Perfect timing get married eh?) 


She's lot traveling several months ago almost 0 restrictions. known areas mostly along border avoided struggling cases. past week 1 person tested positive city coming back trip locked city million people. Everyone getting tested, new cases currently, expecting things calm days. 


I think antidote. Aside small handful people everyone like mindedness willing make personal sacrifice time spread. 


Are numbers dishonest? know. handling different, yes. cultural differences Eastern Western countries making difference outcome far. USA handling things work China vice versa. 


They've outbreaks reaction always lock track everyone. stays relatively contained smaller areas instead spreading outside. 


Last year apartment inroads shut one entrance. sign in/out. wanted go farther away local inform community large would know came back supposed quarantine contact neighborhood. Small things like probably fly Western Countries. would like get Novavax vaccine third dose think made available anytime soon.  Many vaccines eventually lose efficacy require boosters. all! also depend person. 

You blood tested antibodies see still immunity stuff got vaccines kid. vaccine could last lifetime one person someone else wears 10 years. Ironically people like makes people like people like you.

I would literally stay house solid month everyone else would could kick thing.

But everyone will.

So there's point to.

And I'm part everyone crowd hoping well. people try dehumanize unvaccinated, good people paying giant consequences making good choice. Please urge loved ones (or strangers) protect themselves. That’s lot oh man shivered thinking wiener hole either idiot liar probably given benefit doubt. sister lupus. get third shot **right now**? lose what? Please develop

Hospitals currently favoring COVID patients patients. unfair needs stop.

It made sense getting COVID fatality. it’s people getting decisions. Major difference. Everyone I've talked gotten vaccine past week got Delta.

Or, well, case 15-year-old step-nephew dad made him, Delta. Everyone else family already vaccinated. reason repeat massive hospital surges last summer, fall winter, vaccines. Imagine bad would without them. Least It’s 2020 also referring panic buying. least toilet paper.  Time mask Exactly, explanation pinned every article children young people. tried explain people see children hospitalizations 450%! Well yeah went 2 11. top idea difference vs WITH. community spread increases folks go hospital things test positive, get counted covid hospitalized. North Dakota one places make distinction number people covid double number covid essentially halving true covid patient count. Long-term, we're probably looking COVID-19 endemic, we'll likely annual boosters like flu shot. fact, probably get time flu shot. Vaccine uptake lags black brown minority communities, it’s white privilege thing. Doctors group done via AMA failure certify medical schools. benefits established doctors scarcity drives income. insight upset? Yes, since received vaccine, I've noticed I'm less susceptible bad outcome COVID. since polio…   ... like what? Anything resembling classic superpowers?

I want Wolverine claws. Yes. wait, he’s “protecting parental rights” think alot depend state someone lives. Florida vs Vermont parents probably different view points.

But countries soon learned places eventually reinfect One reasons felt better kids back School last year, alternatives mentioned better choice. last year, wore masks, socially distanced much possible. Hospitals supposed built stronger current building laws backup generators.  Whether they’ll work good question.  ""passport"" access non-essential businesses (restaurants, theaters, sports/concert venues, etc.), travel. Every single alternative medicine testimonial works way. like going doctor give series antibiotics - “notice” problem magically instantly cure issue. Always anecdote types. It’s hardly ever “I worked 6 months seen relief”, it’s always “presto spine-o! channeled energy immediately ran 10k”.

And low enough IQ laugh Snake oil salesmen backs horse drawn wagons late 19th century. Pope says it’s ok Exactly. 15 month old daughter. I'd like know risk passing virus her, god forbid. Ssshhhh  Like fully vaccinated partially I'm going every day giving new name. think pharmacist knows he's weirded say anything  lost weight, pretty sure that's need lose lot started eating healthier. I'm sure is, mean would *actually* go way. probably end every 12 months right winter season give strongest protection risk. stock ticker symbol MRNA. mean good sandwich... Right? large number people whose biggest concern last year+wasn’t hospitalization (you never know, statistically, I’m already low risk that) things like long covid, passing virus vulnerable family members, missing work, etc. old?

However, I'm concerned many may wearing masks, low vaccination rates area.

Logistically speaking, much developing world may able adequately store distribute them. almost telling everyone take masks half country unvaccinated young children unvaccinated (and maskless anti-vax boneheads face) stupid idea, Mr. ""Expert"" Fauci. pretty much zero symptoms moderna shots. Got lucky, guess.  India didn’t access vaccine us maybe masks social distancing Perhaps, trying explain lingo journalist you. post based article CNN. statement talking “possibilities” connected fact CNN required write way. research suggest connection, means connection needs study confirm it. Anyway, cheers Yes, also dont feel sympathy people. Sorry correct UK. Didn’t mean offense there. testing appointment finder well? here, first shot problem. 2nd put 2.5 days read book. revelant scene intense. Hospitals set COVID capacity something less actual capacity leave space patients (or fully vaxxed COVID patients).

For example, 60% (making number) hospital's capacity used COVID patients. number reached, ""sorry, we're full"" even empty beds. Would blame BJP came India  wife taken weekend second shot. Luckily us week ahead getting able take care other. Yup. Still waiting second dose week so. biggest danger see vaccinate people catch covid mild symptoms blame unvaccinated people everything spread them. enough people breakthrough cases start living lives like unvaccinated people, hospitals fucked. hospital choose caring MIL caring someone else vaccinated—if enough resources both—they pick someone else.

Your MIL well could person put others hospital first place!

Hopefully, don’t run resources, though.  starting places/countries. need number syllables side comma

Perfectly balanced sentence Sure, there’s reason assume someone vaccine robust immune response keeping infection asymptomatic level, also acting significant vector infecting others. vaccines given fact. top head, rabies one. think tetanus chicken pox occasionally also given exposure reduce symptoms. need given tight window time though. 

But there's nothing suggest covid covid vaccine works like prevention obviously best thing.   much unvaccinated vs vaccinated? hit 200K daily majority unvaccinated, basically means COVID every square inch space existence?

I'm boat. Thank you! look pretty epic too. I’ll look it. Yeah vaccinated polio smallpox kid. 9/11 received smallpox vac #2 Bush 43 administration feared biological agents would used anthrax mailings. Everyone quarantine zoom, guess So, question you. stay home month, right. happens? COVID disappear? Take look what’s going Australia right get back Mask mandates schools stop quarantines. like kids going stop hanging socializing outside school hours, family members skip vaccinations. me, pretty much. got first dose mid March didn’t get second day job requiring it. worried side effects nervous system issues, including tremors well history seizures body overheats. intentionally giving fever second dose wasn’t risk willing take, first dose still provided good amount protection comfortable with. 

And get downvoted, waiver sign get vaccine clause nervous system issues like described. I’m anti vaxxer, personally hesitant. Thank you! I’ve googled searched asking helpful. news reinfections? past infection protects delta? 🥱 boring. Important note COVID associated decently high rate myocarditis Really stupid question time. Thinking buying used car. worry covid car? so, what's best way disinfect? let car sit outside 48 hrs sun? unvaccinated nutcases paying medical bills think irresponsible breakthrough cases covered. Even antivax people Facebook share headlines, without reading token ""vaccines still far better"" paragraph bottom throw justify alarmist, attention-generating headline. definitely idiot, even understand read chart sent thought smoking gun.

Your TOP TAX RATE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE.

If want learn taxes actually work, i'll happy explain you. UK US approach towards vaccines, masks, mandates? 3rd? us plebs gotten 1 hardly fucking information it? Thank much this! Knowing made day. I’ll keep wearing one continue working fit. infect, though? they’re sick enough need go hospital really going going going laying beds suffering consequences stupidity? They’re going infecting others household. others household also unvaccinated...oh well! Nearly every side effect vaccine happens actual Covid … except far worse I'd rather kid get covid suffer two years disrupted schooling. happens people ventilators hurricane hits Houston? 

Dead people. happens people need shelter place like super dome?

More dead people. Especially poor uneducated Ain’t modern science hoot? Good job Moderna! I'm assuming RNA content vaccine? know compare terms number nano particles per dose? bet this? current rate we'll 200k cases per day less two weeks.  Omg love New Zeeland's covid response Better children old people - unnecessary alarm kids getting covid getting really tiresome. It’s everywhere. ask vaccine hospital. father one coworkers died Covid weekend. wasn’t vaccinated either. Late 50s. Also BFF mom friend mine, 53, hadn’t vaccinated wanted make trip planned going US get vaccine daughters (they Mexican), well also died Saturday ventilator 2 weeks. comorbidities either them. perceive antigen one cells, keep producing antibodies?

That issue COVID antibodies telling SF allowing J&amp;J people get mRNA shot now:  Damn … Texas hit 19k yesterday Florida back lead! Go Florida! Scam report Harder everyday empathy this. wish people would get damn shots. Shoot virus. got laid bad fever 4 days second Moderna. feel good week. main concern list carrier transmitting A) strangers/friends/acquaintances, B) children, C) pregnant (but vaccinated) wife. learning basic hygiene would start can't get vaccinated yet, I'm guessing gonna second. already are. governors blaming border crossings surge. definitely fact none Southern states (besides Virginia) top 20 vaccinated states anything. makes sense. Thanks! Disney World already owns city. conduct hostile takeover rest Florida. get tattooed arm like.......nevermind looked Johns Hopkins States feature see ton bright red… actually happened. Delta plus variant B. 1.617.2.1

Not much data yet, US India least, appears infect younger people higher rate. detected back June. anyone know seems lack urgency?

People lazy. Many people lazy *and* think special, ie immune common diseases. Well, straight take thier funding says. Fucking dystopian. Well yeah... older people Vaccinated. course lower vaccinated segment population going higher amount people hospital keeping eye this, guessing 3 4 months excellent protection far stretch. It’s impossible, don’t political drive figure out. often takes something like pandemic becomes apparent. insisting he's right I'm wrong listen ""idiots"".

Ah, classic projection. 

Heres hoping husband doesnt end killing son bullshit. New Zealand also island, orders magnitude easier one hard lockdown, open country locals keeping borders closed.

The discussion Australia, also island, comparison fair. last line makes sound like Delta 50%+ death rate.

You can't live Delta without high vaccinations hopitalises high number people overwhelms medical system. deaths matter. way figure one better terms strength vs delta? sounds unlikely vaccine 2 yos October. sound like older kids vaccine available then, would help unvaccinated 2 yo. Delta might run it’s course too. 

I’d say hold long canceling. Man nobody wants enforce. People getting shot masks think bartender wants get unvaxxed asshole needs drink? go. Just... Don't. matter where, whole idea squeezing plane pandemic stupid begin with.  working well contagious variant. thought would contained it’s spreading. mods hide behind AutoMod much? mod thinks something removed guts put name action. Stop dramatic. know anything hospital? ICU special unit hospital. know 600 bed hospital 20 ICU rooms. people ICU stoke, heart attack massive injury. require 24/7 care. let’s say corona typical use 10 rooms. it’s half full. takes 5 people 50% increase!!!!! Oh god! 

At point didn’t get vaccine that’s problem. free. everywhere.  even everyone wear masks anyway? Dying Covid way worse getting vaccine. people ""choose poorly"". Jokes suckers, Oklahoma we've ICU beds two days now! Slackers!

Dark jokes aside, desperate here. upsets much see people getting killed something that's preventable death! 

I always joked 'How people get point outbreaking zombie movies point return?' know. northeast probably highest vaccinated % western world. Kenny gaping asshole. toxic don’t even know base left cater to. Subzero cognitive skills It’s hard force compliance China. That’s difference. 

Nothing revolutionary.

I thought would contain delta now, haven’t. Cases keep appearing. think keep happening borders nothing else. say ""does allow"". Rather, groups like Mennonites, Mormons, Orthodox Jews scoff whole thing.  pledged donate 160 million vaccines, donated 4 million 1-2 weeks can’t rest country smart like them? hit approximately 3.5 times harder (by infection rate) rest USA. response that. 
As 7/6/21, American Indians (the article’s term) Alaska natives highest vaccination rate racial groups 47%. Hispanics/Latinos Black people know Black people Latinos hit hard too, sure what’s holding back. assume government distrust, understand degree. However feel requires latent assumption harmful shots specially reserved Black person walks door. find unrealistic. I’m sure religion playing huge part 2 groups well. Yeah got second shot Feb I’m honestly wondering need get booster what? India's 2nd wave, requiring BiPAP &amp; requiring Ventilator. could watch Travelling get vaccinated fundamentally quite stupid dangerous something happening.

It would safer everyone say offer shots embassy property fee applying actual visa. need happen, effective people squeeze metal tube.

The real answer course take doses people volume.

You move doses, people.

Moving people doses dangerous practice highlights problem, sort ""solution"" facilitated. Alabama trucking along completely oblivious “hoax.” relatives badly needing O2 I’d start hydrolysing water, taking care evacuate H2 safely.

Of course shouldn’t need brain got vaccine 

My point generate O2 simply cheaply, really desperate   upvote accuracy ur statement. Media scaring us rating/profit.

Super vaxxed thanks efficiency Army lose paperwork post deployment scramble readying unit relocate one state another. What’s endgame though? time high, think.  annoying people abbreviate things business abbreviated. Part reason they’re situation miserably botched vaccine distribution, things right. variants may originated US, spread like crazy people refuse get vaccinated wear masks. rate it’s matter time see US variant pop up.  Sure they’re *causing them* they’re allowing variants stronghold isn’t vaccine hesitancy analogous educational hesitancy black community? 

The whole point even though laws may equal now, unequally negative outcomes due historical mistreatment. Exact thing. people ask ""What side effects?"" respond with, ""I took nap."" much want bet people still get vaccinated? make sense?  ever something turn dick measuring competition ""teams"", vaccination rates. hand, hospital needs treat dying people COVID. unvaccinated people ICU insurance, hospital prices skyrocket.

Bottom line, unvaccinated people undoubtedly costing us money. People sub still make feel like I’m practically unvaccinated vaccine available time J&amp;J. Wait make boyfriend wear mask hangout ?

I’m trying sound condescending, don’t understand  got J&amp;J shot first week March, felt fucking *terrible*. High fever, chills, muscle aches, it.

It gone *day*. cannot fathom people thinking they're better catching disease. could.. know, give countries need instead throwing away. yeah I'd booster got cleared also Interesting one ones got Moderna second shot Canada since Pfizer time hopefully good news us got Pfizer Moderna mix u/popopotatoes160 \- central AR. see everything talking about. think going?

Same! already serious severe asthma seeing tubes enough help/rooms scared daylights me. agree adults, especially prescribe extreme self-reliance, need held accountable actions. said malicious lied manipulated politicians political commentators call “journalists” believing covid fake vaccine equivalent experimented James Bond esque villain.

It’s sad situation say suppose.  sure post this, found insightful understanding relationship delta variant vaccination rates. enjoy numbers, (simplified) golden formula scientific leaders make decisions epidemic precautions: 


R = N \*(1-P\*V)

 
R reproduction rate  
\- Less 1.0 rate eventually diminish own.  
\- Greater 1.0 virus multiples exponentially it’s current environment. 
 
N natural reproductive rate virus 
 
V efficacy vaccine 
 
P percentage population vaccinated and/or immune 
 
 
Chickenpox R 10-12 
COVID Delta R 5 8 
Polio R 5-7 
Smallpox R 3-6 
COVID R 2.9 
SARS R 2-4 
Annual Flu 1.3 
 
So currently 50% population vaccinated, say generous 95% efficacy: 
 
R = 2.9\*(1-.50\*.95) = **1.5225**; virus still growing.  would need get 69% vaccinated 1.0 
 
With delta variant: 
 
R = 6.5\*(1-.50\*.95) = **3.0875**  would need get 89% vaccinated 1.0. 
 
However, factors like masks, social distancing, natural antibodies, etc would also lower R rating (and complicate formula).  **This preventable actions recommended since vaccination rates high enough current time push R 1.0.** 


Looking back historically outbreaks, took several years get control. current vaccination rate, needing 80%+ population vaccinated Delta variant, likely taking 2-3 years total.  :-( thought crazy heard Austin 6 ICU beds available.

This morning heard Covid patients occupying 25% ICU beds Houston, though keep mind Texas Medical Center lot ICU beds here, plus know hospitals ability convert regular beds ICU beds. googling ""hospital ATH"" brings air transportable hospital... Im going assume thats mean. ATH mean please? Shocker don't. 

I keep shouting rooftops, *but people need keep antibody levels high taking additional shots*. elderly otherwise compromised can't risk breakthrough infection. harm actually oath.

Common misconception.

It's sad truth people, including grandfather. comes soaking information hear, able separate truth lies. I'm curious people refused vaccination get priority care ?

Surely stick room somewhere get get second, waste time resources people others right thing need care. Looking like Delta Plus gonna falter lieu Delta - might speaking soon that, think sometimes fall narrative 'well next variant *definitely* worse', works ways. 

Not I'm concerned, course, wish media hyperbole problem - would probably easier get people healthy respect virus time. enough research yet signs may common. understanding presymptomatic spread common asymptomatic. said science could changed now. cost, though? said Australia. seems like covid really effects fat people severely. Everytime one articles gets posted always obese person ventilator. Logical fallacy. ton factors go someone's body composition, beyond control. Also fact bmi terrible indicator health. fucking silly comparison. Yes, event include thousands antivax people US. It’s news worthy could super spreader event. Thanks this! agree force shutdown school. Let's see long lasts. guarantee amount sane people country number loudmouths. Considering many doctors anti-vaxxers… maybe?

Or straight made up. Either way, Dexter knows shit trust assessment. wasn’t actually orgy it? mean, statement spans across world. yes, disappointing. Question asked explain position it’s person said winter ugly, would expect able answer first said disagree first person? 

They could agreeing want hear why. 

They infer context whole thread whatever answer related covid winter actually ugly 

Remindme! four months “is ugly?” Studies UK found vaccinated 50% less likely catch kind delta infection. studied population mostly using less effective vaccine commonly used US. Sp base assumption incorrect. Vaccination lessen infection thus lower chances variants. 

Further one pays cash ICU. COVID cheap way die. absolutely significant societal economic cost letting people die peace. social safety net. employers, families, economy general. 

Finally kids immunocompromised share planet rest us. Making people like cancer patients live final days (in cases) effectively bubble people can’t bothered take safe effective medication sadistic. Except lot us take year science courses, mathematics minimum requirement, absolutely part curricula. Hell, college calculus required majors including art history.  Hiw many dead kids take 2014-2015 give shit flu?  False positive! Whew! Dude work real estate industry? idea statistics work, needed r/math tech basic algebra, you’re running around acting like jury member Nature.

Sucky thing is, stuck job I'd gotten $60k pay raise. New management got everybody paid lol. P sure means they’ve peaked flu never killed me. problem. know anybody else kids cautious COVID are? remember reading lot last year homeschool “pods” unified effort small pod kids Flu kills less per year covid. US, flu kills tens thousands per year. Covid kills hundreds thousands. dont think check IDs 12 year olds anyway right? Since people 15 dont ID. didnt show mine. either keeping number infections low hat number variants. vaccines could … still win soon delta-specific third shot successfully waited Omega variant. 2014/2015 lockdowns, mask mandates, social distancing, virtual school, etc? 416 number 2020/2021 would much much worse employed precautions 2014/2015. talking DeSantfranchised everyone is?  need nurses attend patients,

I'm sorry, completely understand means. suggest current rise cases we're experiencing blip rather sign continued trends foreseeable future? trying invalidate never seen graphs type want understand what's going on. President can't really anything matter. Maybe could try executive action mandate things like masks GOP Florida would take court second signs it. Wow, that's crazy! Hunter, Obama company reenacted mask mandate today announcement actually said masks would go back optional local case rate drops 50/100k. That's based directly new CDC guidance. Look virtual public schools like K12, states tuition free. see one Florida called connections academy Lol, source data providing [warns key statistic used formulate ""active cases"" ""highly yet accusing others cherry picking data. Active Cases = (total cases) - (total deaths) - Recoveries = statistic highly imperfect, reporting missing, incomplete, incorrect, based different definitions, dated (or combination these) many governments, local national level, sometimes differences states within country counties within state. fired treated like Democrat rest party. Get live life already, quit hiding Except didn't, hahaha, piles bodies streets overrun hospitals? Oooopsie Angeles County already reimposed mask mandate indoor public settings, applies regardless vaccine status. new ordinance, adopted, would require patrons least one vaccine dose order enter “restaurants, bars, retail establishments, fitness centers, spas, entertainment centers stadiums, concert venues, movie theaters.”



Good. Thoughts lambda? I'm messing dum dums

...no...you're asshole. Mine easier. happened yet...so proof needed back statement besides ""I'm guessing"", fear mongering alarmist. But, could look differences last winter now:

1. vaccines
2. far higher community immunity (rhyming up. vaccine naturally induced)
3. 4 months improve things
4. Children also start vaccinated then

These variables make different last winter, common sense based. studies show fact help future, sort known thing. 

So, like painting, pose ""whore"" painting, weird things paint? (username) Talk pediatrician! asking strangers reddit do? place fear machine. Kids are, least vast majority, risk severe cases death COVID. Yes, happens. flu also kills kids, way covid, yet still send children school every year. 

Talk pediatrician. did, put mind right ease. Doctor TX. know where. Basically: 

Writer 57 history bad respiratory infections different varieties. Didn’t want chance waning efficacy walked get third dose six months second Pfizer shot. Family made snide comments. Weighed opinion decided getting third shot better going trash. Funny seeing things side, fled Fort Worth things started getting bad west, came back months ago it’s looking like might go back Texas Oh definitely, think Doctors bear burden deciding worthy treatment. see point there. Must hard even feel hint resentment towards patients.

And actually advocate system people sorted care according worthiness. It'd end causing strife get politicized stuff. Better focus healthy citizenry education opportunities. seems looking data one dose

I wasn't, explained Vaccinated people need understand still risk Delta variant. Wear mask stay away large crowds. We're still operating old narrative derived Alpha data said vaccinated people move pandemic. 
Delta dragged us back in. 
 
The good news vaccine still helpful, brings Rt number low enough probably mitigate spread light social distancing like wearing mask reduced capacity. see severe lockdowns near horizon. point vaccinated people need quit acting like they've moved pandemic. 18 months covid? Surely kids died 18 mo flu season don’t expect eradicated. want get point threat masks, shutdowns, etc doesn’t ever come again. Good.. I've already assimilated system fear-mongering Twitter accounts gotten common recently? bios always like “Mom. Daughter. Progressive AF. *Insert occupation*. Nerd. Anti-DNC.

That's fair  found difficult read, tables graphs unfriendly eyes.

I applied best copy&amp;paste abilities compiled Jack&amp;Jill bit comparison official Covid deaths total excess deaths.

I think unfortunate time frames vary much, still gives clear picture countries serial underreporters Covid deaths. keep things bit shorter, omitted micronations (as much statistical coincidence) several countries basically suffered Covid (at least reported time-frame), nothing see (e. g. Australia, NZL, Taiwan, Uruguay).

When Milwaukee Bucks secured first NBA championship win 50 years two weeks ago, sea 100,000 fans roared outside stadium city’s Deer District. largely unmasked crowd jumped held phones, snapping pictures recording victory.

Now, Milwaukee health commissioner says event may common factor surge covid-19 cases. Tuesday, Wisconsin Department Health Services identified almost 500 attendees later contracted covid.

“We encourage anyone attended large gathering, watch party Deer District, get tested covid-19 due increased risk transmission,” Milwaukee Health Commissioner Kirsten Johnson said briefing Tuesday.

The news, first reported Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, latest report possible outdoor superspreader event highly contagious delta variant spreads rapidly throughout country. outbreak Provincetown, Mass., probably began packed events July Fourth holiday weekend, resulted almost 900 cases Friday, Washington Post reported.

Public health experts also expressed concern Lollapalooza, outdoor music festival Chicago took place last weekend. Despite outside, packed crowds 100,000 concertgoers per day could lead surge amid contagious delta variant growing rate breakthrough cases among vaccinated.

Many states, including Wisconsin, seeing stark uptick coronavirus cases. past week, daily reported cases rose 85 percent, hospitalizations 84 percent, according Post’s covid tracker.

With 56 percent received least one vaccine dose Wisconsin, number daily administered doses slowed. past week, average inoculations per day dropped 12 percent, according Post’s vaccine tracker.

To date, Wisconsin Department Health Services identified 491 cases statewide person infected attended championship event Deer District, health commissioner said Tuesday. results led state boost contact tracing; Johnson noted number cases probably far higher recorded.

“We anticipated increase positive cases due delta variant, \[a\] 155 percent increase one week distressing,” Johnson said.

As Milwaukee Bucks made way closer championship season, Wisconsin health experts community leaders warned large watch parties celebrations could lead covid cases surge.

“In terms Bucks event, lot people sometimes celebratory events, sometimes let guard down,” Ruben Anthony, president chief executive Urban League Greater Madison, told WKOW last month.

Representatives Milwaukee Bucks immediately respond Post’s request comment late Wednesday.

Johnson noted uptick cases across state solely connected packed July 20 event outside stadium could still traced back Bucks watch parties.

“People weren’t attending events Deer District,” Johnson said. “They also going bars parties friends’ houses family events.”

“I think important recognize time large gathering people, going see virus spread,” added.    Especially media running daily hourly articles ""divided"" ""angry"" are. do; best way keep sane maintain perspective. control much. frequent sub taken effective action available them, take comfort seeing data shows *how* effective choice is. Seems fair. you’re one “vaccines violate freedoms” moron, get sick, admitted rack astronomical medical bills…that mistake financial responsibility…not everyone else’s. mention vaccinating negatively affects everyone else around you. appalled much misinformation idiocy world today, enough patience, find factual information anything wish. late Florida. teacher mandated wear masks kids. Go figure. Significantly lower testing well tho. Much lower proportion vaccination proportion UK.

So absolutely pass 300k real world cases (maybe already have), testing could bottleneck getting confirmed cases, making situation seem better is. put name hat kidcovestudy.

They also mentioned going recruit pediatric doctors, called make sure going one Dr's study.

The study people called us earlier week, affirmed desire (only took two kids though, them), scheduled us shots couple weeks.

Includes weekly blood draws, symptom logging, stuff. Regardless, anyone 7 months post-second dose frontline worker. question. Vaccines otherwise available early January. good ""Delta lasts two weeks"" crowd Read stats man find doctor stressing covid kids.

Its barelly affecting children.

I say again.

Flu dangerous school attending children covid.Flu hits almost age group similary hard.

Covid hits elderly hardest, younger infected easier them.

Not sure babies, dont much data yet age group found study going details babies preschool kids. studies backing up? refuting it, need something throw dad's face buddy heart attack keeps blaming vaccine suspect residual effects caught covid previously. Lots Vitamin &amp; C dad. 
That helped recover 2 days. Sure do. CNN lot staff need work field share vans cars together. Also organization believes protecting community impose certain requirements. vaccine requirement found lawful. read dramatic increase cases, Laham pediatric infectious disease experts nationwide tell NBC News hard evidence yet delta variant transformed virus something dangerous early tell,"" said Dr. Bernhard Wiedermann, infectious diseases specialist Children's National Hospital Washington, D.C. ""It's going take time collection data multiple sites know"" whether delta variant is, fact, virulent kids previous versions virus.  *Hope Scholarship vouchers would made available parents don’t want children wearing masks school districts require them, proposed policy set review Friday state Board Education.* Agreed. Vaping thing worked get cigarettes. Two years vaping lead able quit cold turkey now, almost year nicotine free. hate every minute probably need anti-depressant, six months started vaping could breathe again. well yeah, nearly irrelevant. least alpha whatever og was. blm protests, nobody got ill(basically). Wow. Look graph. see people Florida way casual masking. i'd find new relatives love Australia takes every single case seriously tries get bottom it. said important remind people payments $450 $1,500 available support miss work get tested isolate 14-day period.

Obviously, big problem low vaccination rates, hopefully get handle on.  get trial? happened kids?

How many died?

How many long covid?

How long want schools closed?

Is damage lost socialisation schooling smaller health benefits closed schools? think even felt shot. even look even notice. Yes, correct. even question means we've already made wrong decision. correct decision would ramp production capacity adequate level months ago. What? jews particularly rabbis would argue preserving life obligation, kosher alternative a, non kosher medicine justified.

And there's bunch legalistic hair splitting animal parts considered ""food"" begin with, things transformed longer food, etc... actually look raw medical data statistics then- instagram stories. they'll bear exactly we've saying months- shots extremely effective, even delta. 

and FDA organization beholden corporate lobbying interests other. going find reassurance infallible expert authority looking look history long hard enough. wait rubber stamp it. yeah might go get shot, ""FDA approval"" great basis decision. get soon possible. Thanks part science that's saving us all! They'd rather go barely tested monoclonal antiobody treatment because...well really know why. Obama started covid though Yup, lol. know ton people last school shutdown rotated shoving kids different people's houses based upon work schedule. Plus kids socializing playing order stay healthy. day programs essential workers kids...

Not mention people paycheck moving family/friends houses. 20 people single family home near us one point, kids day, etc. think asymptomatic people spreading high amount? Humans animals.
We admittedly animals perceive high level intelligence.. animals non less.

As result, self preservation driver always be.

The people avoid vaccination lied end belief vaccination would detrimental self preservation.

People generally forget care we're inherently selfish people realise They're selfish. “It can’t happen here” last thing people say does. “Blocking” won’t change that, you. 🤷‍♀️ Yes, laid 24 hours second shot, totally fine next morning. time start feeling cavalier Covid remember awful felt shot makes careful again. easy become doctor now. log onto Facebook free training.  boggles mind people pretend kids can’t get really sick covid. 

And adding confusion mindset, fact even kids (hypothetically) never seriously ill, spread one another providing chances mutation/variants. 

Pretty sure don’t want large percentage kids catch this. Apparently me, might fourth wave course company made product would report this? independent numbers?

The headline even misleading, OP's title. necessary?
Contrarian POV: Absolutely, yes.

There (seemingly increasing) segment society completely incapable learning something hazardous without first experienced negative - possibly fatal - consequences firsthand.

Is advisable put bullet cylinder revolver, put barrel one's temple pull trigger? people would say, ""no"" without giving much thought. However, (correctly) point majority people trying perfectly fine. Besides, far fewer deaths people playing Russian roulette killed flu typical year ... 6 days notes Austin region, 6 days ago, 13 ICU beds free all. surge going get much worse gets better, think OP probably telling truth.

More recent, Dallas beds available. I'm sure places converting non ICU space ICU space surges, total bed number may moving around bit, causing % utilization changes. current cases US among unvaccinated people.

I'm really starting wonder that's true, places like county (Los Angeles) reporting 25% cases vaccinated people.  October thing believed complete sham. Logically, there's mechanic would made October surge subside instead continuing grow. I've collecting articles people breakthrough infections (anecdotal evidence) wondering exact question: vaccine effective?

At first, Moderna seemed slightly protective, based statistical data studies really bummed got Pfizer (I able choose two).

But articles I've read far, there's cases breakthrough infections Moderna Pfizer. couple Moderna cases ended hospital well, seem like Moderna protective (at least absolute terms).

There's also cases Johnson &amp; Johnson one Novavax. happen link data? curious confidence intervals around numbers. possible statistically depends sample sizes. Please include Abbott Longer explanation - antibodies immune cells body creates response vaccine target various ranges surfaces spike - antibody lock onto ""enough"" surface disable it. such, mutation changes expression protein surface, antibodies code changed section longer effective, antibodies code sections still are. 
The end result mutation, number antibodies fight new strain goes down, incremental - virus common surfaces alpha's spike simply Covid-19 anymore. won’t find much disagreement rant American education system it’s flaws. want improve schools society? I’m right you. 

My concern children’s well being. Another year virtual school could negative effects long term. me, children sacrificed group pandemic. able see friends, family, go school, go trips, etc. adds up. things life effects children’s health right besides COVID. 

Let’s also calm fear mongering here. I’m sure know chances children getting COVID severely enough DIE almost non existent. Less flu things never even think closing school for. I’m sure percentage teachers fully vaccinated high again, school year filled death over, unlikely. heart disease, cancer

OMG, wish two shot vaccine prevent these. would happy take 6 shots feel like crap couple weeks significantly lower chance dying these. people say unvaccinated start dying truly think gonna happen? 2020 vaccine deaths leaning towards upper age echelon sat 2% mortality, delta mortality 50% higher im clearly missing something or? There’s agreed definition ‘true’ deaths. Countries count deaths attributable Covid differently.

Even country (UK) frequently two numbers reported, deaths people confirmed Covid, mention Covid death certificate.

Please judge me. posting background either why. I'm going vegas 3 weeks. get one done JJ pfizer/moderna even though 2nd dose trip? Canceling trip option.  It’s free Walgreens shouldn’t know it, thing medical insurance card would probably go super stealth grab  According UK's ""technical briefing"" data, mRNA vaccines reduce infection 88% (this probably overestimate; US data like 80%) severe outcomes something like 3.5x breakthrough cases. level protection high, perfect.

In particular, means old people still *far* risk under-25s. kids IFR seems somewhere 1/10,000 1/100,000 (comparable bit worse chickenpox). Whereas UK over-50 fully-vaccinated CFR 1.3%; vaccinated CFR people ~30-50 0.036%. Remember CFR 80% protection infection fails - risk low definitely still worth reducing. various places talking boosters elderly (and probably regular boosters, getting flu). sad hear.

But allowed choose patients. Plenty doctors it! “We don’t take new patients” example.

If you’re tires covidiots, go treat victims agression, people diseases control upon.

The society needs you, reckless people need face consequences actions endanger you.

Heck could even decide treat people covid negative. not? choose put bodies, also get choose want exposed deadly virus!!! spending last several months, next, world wide coordinated effort get vaccines arms variants much fresh meat? bother CDC stopped collecting breakthrough data people contract covid aren’t hospitalized?

It totally bother me. That's data interested in, honestly. First off, one study two studies doesn’t answer anything especially it’s pushed certain tribe. guess don’t realize easy manipulate statistics. 

You aware many Covid variance correct? earth legitimate studies point terms many people virus actually still spread it? can’t one study act like answers questions there’s much going that. 

Let’s say Covid stops spread 50% although idea true there’s reason believe lot people it’s not. help us get herd immunity. lot people would like know specifics getting vaccine especially variables going like Delta variants not. doesn’t surprise me; Florida, all. first shot count. 2nd shot, fine sore arm, body aches slight temp. Yes think non vaccinated people risk vaccinated people since ones making virus mutate. Yep. 

But NC much higher population Mississippi. 11 million versus 3 million. 

I’m hating we’re hospitalizing 100 additional people day NC. might find interesting. discernible changes whatsoever. Fully vaccinated Pfizer May 6. many days/weeks in? People dont get vaccinated point countries vaccines available playing luck. got second shot Yesterday feel horrible today much prefer getting Covid. Oh yeah forgot corona desantis made rule like masks aren’t allowed schools anymore? hospitals capacity, right. don't. means make decisions gets treated doesn't. Someone *has* lose situation problem! pretty big news firms strong influence overall corporate risk decisions, ideally “encourage” large financial firms follow suit encourage large service companies outside finance also follow suit.

If position done home, seems like common sense right keep employees home try prevent spread much possible. get saying... vaccine providing sterilizing immunity. therefore who're un-vaxxed readily get infected. Definitely there's truth that, there's huge concern among parents send kids back school next 3 weeks. terms tragedy that's unfolding hospitals hot zones, mainly unvaxxed adults who're hit. rolled dice &amp; refused shot believing everyone else around would get vaxxed insulate infection. wrongly believed getting covid would worse mild pneumonia. Thanks clarifying. I’m clearly layman it’s getting harder understand state things. Thanks detailed post well. Yeah I’ve NYC Seattle places asked vaccine card.  Well guess specialists tell us Jojo effect ongoing time. lockdowns , openings. dragged long time. minister president said this: ""if locked everything would get rid covid withing month, however that's possible that."" 

I say make happen. Rather full lockdown total isolation month stead dragging try save economy. That’s life. 


Hard understand wretches.

Nobody asked born particular ‘colour’ ‘sex’, stuck dirtball. hopeful sure. Although variety vaccines flu one time went away thought weren’t effective.

However still use veterinary medicine Bordetella/Parainfluenza vaccines Better buy Pfizer / moderna stock Ya there's way happening. 

So options endanger low wage workers zero representation endanger teachers?

Obviously low wage workers going lose every time. Again, real solution problem, least acknowledge cost workers. That’s point though. large portion population never going get vaccinated.   True could next John Q 😂 need booster every 6 months? Exactly! free(ze) market work. pregnant women? second shot February, I'm feeling kinda nervous now.... Okay, that’s different statement. That’s saying *one* piece data Delta, true. majority data go explicitly Delta variant.

She’s referring federal tracking data that’s presented early presentation, primarily pre-Delta. actual studies looking outcomes Delta. 0.05% death rate treatment.

Orders magnitude higher death rate treatment unavailable due filled ICUs. That's NY, NJ, New England many deaths first months Spreading incorrect information like quite bad outright lies perpetuated elsewhere. Lulling people false sense security idea vaccines *remain* infallible extremely irresponsible. 

Stop. It. Please. 

Covid-19 achieving vaccine escape reported *yet*. idea can't happen exceptionally unlikely *wrong*. [active preliminary data shows likely [already particular mutant go wide. Further, [vaccine continues, apply additional selective pressure spike protein mutants. Stupid stupid does. subscription Moderna vaccine run out, please subscribe continue protection don’t like experiment. Since experiment kids? anyone claiming Lollapalooza good idea?  think it’s obvious lot antivaxxers didn’t study biology school. I’m referring CDC’s earlier guidance told vaccinated ok go without mask inside even data whether vaccinated infected spread virus. Yes, delta 1% cases America time, saw India. thinking? Note two career CDC scientists quit CDC guidance came out, it’s reasonable suspect decision contentious. 

Here Florida, almost everyone took mask (regardless vaccination status), local mask mandates allowed expire, can’t get anyone wear mask again. It’s free all. 

So respect, don’t warm fuzzies CDC anymore. I’m scared frustrated Floridian. young otherwise healthy? Probably panic attack. happens. buddy bad one years ago rushed hospital— panic attacks feel like heart attack sure. 

Vaccines without risk, risk waaaaaay lower getting Covid sure. 

The world isn’t that, though. Dude, Western governments barely maintain roads let alone lists undesirables. Lambda, Epsilon, Delta Plus around unable compete Delta circulating, immediately suggests Delta fitter variant. Nobody suggesting new variants can’t emerge, unlikely Lambda, Epsilon, Delta Plus Uninsured 65 largest subgroup unvaccinated. anecdotal evidence backed statistical 2 young children. There’s big ones Brazil, or. 100% correct even US vaccinated last person delta would still come in. knows wants say current hit US could prevented heavy vaccination numbers hospital overloads happening now.

However, he's playing audience believes crazy things take statements stay headline fashion. Essentially, right arms around buzzwords lack ability understand deeper statistical trends played to.  calculated statements made POTUS probably frustrating say way us hear.  Want. Now. epsilon variant originated California January, far know. I'm sure minor variants throughout country never gained traction.

Unvaccinated countries continue big risk factor, US capable generating variants well. said way it?
Seriously.

Maybe it’s time revisit little bit. Even doctors nurses sick this.

It’s like it’s law physics can’t change Hey Sturgis attendees: stay fuck Minnesota leave rally. nice little spike cases shortly rally last summer I’ll take butt wiener hole don’t care reference, support point view line thinking: don’t trust you, is, quoting hospitalizations deaths reflect delta variant, cdc director says” Wuhan Institute Virology discover sars-cov-2, wuhan hospital system people kept showing ""sars-like pneumonia"". case hospital surge Wuhan months happened anywhere else assume virus either emerged mutated near by. already original covid?

OK, tell words that's *medically* significant study cognitive decline. What's mechanism matter vaccinated cohort exhibits symptoms. symptoms.

What proposed mechanism? US? 
You could ask here, search think states like Bihar restrictions really enforced . suggest visit once. People forgotten COVID one wears mask. Stop blaming issue one event mayor may cause. Maybe testing thoroughly.  agree classroom huge space potential spread. student? child? online environment extremely taxing kids. 

Highschoolers started 2018 graduate next year places got see classroom one semester highschool. 

Some children start kindergarten/first grade without even knowing real school functions kids gonna 3rd 4th graders within next year.

College students may different story since option stay home live campus. However, several students either come US school go different state school knowing ONE gone half college career without knowing anyone.

Traditional school one greatest blessings good chunk kids. Social queues, social experience, friendships (some lifelong) formed environments. Elementary junior high, highschool, college stories born parents, grandparents, aunts uncles tell us. Children, pre-teens, teens, young adults living weird limbo life nothing seems moving forward education.

If sit take exam computer, unproctored open book/note, learning? I'm utilizing note taking skills.

Whats ""phucked"" individuals reenter true educational environment, knowing nothing works.

The push close schools, rather find safer ways run push vaccine younger individuals. 

These children suffering lack true education whether like hear not.

Children getting covid cool either, children inherently less likely pass away disease regardless. Literally zero changes.

The effective means convince someone mindset see Covid personal threat family. White House essentially control media. would tell media shut mention vaccine mandates, passports, fines, etc. (no stories punitive measures) focus footage stories people dying hospitals. way convince hold outs change position. usually mental health issues precipitate obesity. smokers? would add mix. It’s shitstorm, Rand Free whom? support businesses require proof vaccination. view on-going choices current state being. drug addict actively trying recover, society help you. obese actively taking steps improve health, society help you.

If drug addict taking steps try get clean, society burdened poor on-going choices. healthy individual making on-going choice refuse vaccines freely available you, society burdened get extremely sick.

Im like deathly ill, preconceptions productive today window sure. I'm 7% right report inaccurate. can't imagine many health care professionals going need sort therapy, career changes whole thing. Maybe that's it, there's really end. waves. we're sorta left ride drown conceptualization divide beds vaccinated vaccinated covid wards loosely according percentage population area serve vaccinated unvaccinated. 60% unvaccinated beds unvaccinated population beds occupied, capacity unvaccinated patients. probably lying. 

Something important (getting vaccinated), make time it. takes 1 hour day depending live jab. 

I bet spent *2,000* hours fooling around Facebook Netflix, oh no, time vaccine. variant Covid19 least. understand, thing lets virus infect us spike protein, spike protein also thing vaccines teach bodies recognize attack. virus completely evade vaccines would lose spike protein so, would also mean would lose mechanism infect us. Boy, really tell kids doesn't... Wishing well homie. You’ll beat it. free access free vaccine probably since March April? Thank @ Ron dickhead DeSantis. 

Your policies crippling Healthcare infrastructure!  clear, I'm asking specifics gory details. read, sure understood situation. Obesity typically pathology. 99% people, given simple option like vaccine would instantly turn obese, would choose option. people obese way due underlying disease, physical psychological (food addiction, binge eating disorder). Since obesity symptom disease (and arguably disease itself), would unfair treat different potential disease someone may have.

Anti-vaxxers hand usually contrarian dickwads.  what?  think important go places world even first doses. Humoral immunity may well wear off, cellular immunity generally expected lifelong. need get used covid mild disease still spread kill us large numbers anymore, doses get really need be. stimulus checks vaccinated people! flu shot never comes close effectiveness - yet millions us get one every year, rightfully believing worth reduction chances symptomatic illness severity catch flu.  

I understand covid vaccines held unrealistic standard.  They're already way effective expected time year ago suddenly chunk population, that's good enough. reasonable expect one ever upper respiratory symptoms ever again... prefer dead children apparently. clarity coming regarding vaccine’s impacts transmission? 

I see lots tweets blaming unvaccinated folks variants “the possibility COVID-19 become seasonal like flu”

But instead, news like coming Israel (a vaccine success story yet midst new COVID-19 wave) point premature lockdown endings poor masking causing possibility? Should? I've seen data suggests yes, definitely kind thing ask doctor recommendation doing, least there's official guidance. 

Can? could literally walk CVS country say ""I want covid shot."" could get 30 per day felt like it. know several immunocompromised people gotten third way. tracking pretty, well, absent. Get proper PCR wait anyways. Rapid crap  ignores fact Texas nearly vaxxed northeast. Houston may be, plenty non-Houston residents going Houston often. Yeah, issue walking around spewing virus show symptoms. Sooo get it? Everyone keeps talking third shots one lets get ""That's 24 plagues! outta ammo mister!' got J&amp;J vaccine couple months ago concerned efficacy. worth also get double dose Moderna Pfizer right now? Yeah, I'm realizing low-wage essential health workers suffer though also contribute spread coronavirus, time, capacity, resources simultaneously advocate patients workers better healthcare system.. Front line workers exhausted.  person responding originally saying one prevented getting vaccine. table linked dealt allergic reactions, also certain cancers prevent people getting vaccines, even recovery. 

But yes, overall number people can't get vaccine relatively rare, way 1% population. already covid good news vaccine works sort like booster, youll pretty good protection aslong get 2+ weeks masks ran body bags first surge. first Pfizer dose wasn’t bad, got 2nd dose January knocked ass 2 days. Chills hot flashes, muscle aches, could barely stay awake. rough. 

And *two days* life. That’s nothing. got feel rough home bed, hospital necessary. risk long-term cognitive side effects, lung damage, cardiac damage. crippling medical bills. 


Even mild case COVID sounds WAY worse vaccine. I’ll take 3rd dose tomorrow tell us need that. I’ll get booster every month. *2000  Plus weed sold dispensary like 10 20 1 ratio THC CND. got this, random person internet believes you! :) fully vaccinated, favour restrictions? safe blood clots pericarditis. Get vaccine! So...what next week look like region hospitals already overwhelmed new staffing shortage? outcomes going keep getting worse? Where's anti-vax Barbie? Well, care last year would year? also furious many people probably spread to?! ""This awful, regrets."" Yeah well.... animals equal. equal others. early data delta far infectious regular COVID. Keep wearing mask stay away unvaccinated people. v1.5, let's see patch notes called triage way system set manage mass casualty incidents. I'm parent send kid school kids parents. They're real they're idiots  Los Angeles Mississippi still suffering hook worm epidemic? weakens immune system people become mentally slow Exactly! Man don’t get it. Much like elderly. fixed index cases double deaths also double? factors affect numbers move other? also power standing, says matter binding effect. like COVID? Willing bet lot students needing get university starts mandates employers. see data all? Also I'm sure black white cognitive impacts rather spectrum impact agree slippery slope especially since food system screwed six ways Sunday. Sugary, fat-filled foods cheaper making minimum wage. diet nothing Ramen (which really high salt unless eat without flavor packet) show weight gain nutritious diet encourage healthy diet thus adding weight increasing risk disease elephant room people talking exercise 100% make healthy, eat right, good mix macro Protein, Carbs, Fat, one category exercise. Exercise actually give healthy issues ingest right amount protein allow body recover muscle stress able exercise long without right amount carbs quick starting energy. Fats help blood stay fluid well finding helps nerve impulses. brain uses fatty acids fuels protein (though long needed compared muscle tissue). need adjust food system make raw unprocessed foods cheaper ding people insurance obesity. keep processed foods need levels sodium fat them, even flavor. try challenge people fight reduced fat salt flavor reason (it BS know, porn ""story""), challengeing try different herbs spices. accpeted nautrally reduced thier sodium fat intake get flavor [spices. spices makes food interesting fun. Wear well-fitting cloth mask it; seal gaps add couple layers. sure would try hardest mom teach child importance it, like washing hands is. retired infection control nurse, virus airborne mask best defense. week 72,000 children hospitalized COVID variant. important, raised 4 children knowing wash hands, stay 3 feet away coughing, cough elbow germs transmitted. made fun learned. doesn’t bad safe life. Make fun! time teach!! Yeah I'd imagine plenty on-the-fence people saw cases collapsing late spring figured need now. reality happened. couple % likely side effects moderna compared pfizer. Major extinction event 🤣 Simple minds deliberately obtuse? hard tell sometimes. Yeah second Moderna shot like getting hit semi truck repeatedly run back forth 12 hours. 

Then magically instantly felt better 12 hours up. 12 hours joke. amount work takes setup kind network misinformation, employee people facilitate it, manage track data beyond probably imagine goes something like this. probably also shock knew much money something like makes. We're talking millions, sometimes double triple digit millions. 

This guy troll online, criminal enterprise.  Mortality rate every medical emergency skyrocketed. Fuck antivaxers boosters simply 3rd shot? Meaning 1st 2nd shot? really tough job, one society really needs. Total respect. I'm buying it. UK fizzled down. US weeks behind. know I've read multiple papers immunocompromised people virus months multiple mutations. 

Here's example showing mutations one patient time: article links explains  specifically ask smoker not? Jesus. :( I've following r/FloridaCoronavirus recognize name - awesome job keeping everyone updated. everything crossed guys. like thrown wolves.

I hope Nikki Fried wins primary efforts help. know get elected, seems like great hands, see efforts around virus. I'm sorry, totally sympathize. friend could accompany appointment? J&amp;J shot really nice since needed one time. assume point recommend mRNA shot however. keep best :) Florida's gonna hitting time highs while. bright side cases go among vaccinated mean they're going hospitalized overwhelm health system. Yes! STAT please! Moderna+, competing Pfizelix True. sound bad. hope help hang on. oximeter? least let know blood oxygen falling much. least know head hospital. attack rate teenagers already high?  liked old version better.  strong side effects 2nd dose Moderna. First dose pretty normal okayish, second one mild fever 2 days; arm hurt 5 days so, red super warm rest body.

 
Had visit doctor 5th day everything turned okay later.          Let’s see next week’s OBon brings… 
Just glad elderly laws fully vaccinated now. bit malicious play here. Conservative chambers definitely downplayed virus made appear like nonissue exaggerated “liberal” news media.

So even antivax, even strongly political, that’s community treating virus, yeah would appear like big deal something could put off. Confusing risk low risk again. Most, all, experience severe symptoms. That's definition low risk. 

But hey right, let's ignore since 3rd deadliest outbreak last 200 years #1.  selfish thought.  strong side effects 2nd dose Moderna. First dose pretty normal okayish, second one mild fever 2 days; arm hurt 5 days so, red super warm rest body.

I’d say weathers nice but… well you’re finding totally get gotta ask source. supply isnt issue, fact isnt enough people legally transport DOT limitations long driver road day causes shortages. 

None changed unless state emergency declared govenor. governor literally killing people refusing so. 

The feds wont step mask mandate place. 

Surprise, surprise. agree Na-na get jab access Google search engine. Reddit, etc. understand many sources information, access sources information. people choosing ignore follow information reinforces biases. sick husband get? cloned vs ""actual"" DNA reasoning used Catholic moralists determine whether vaccine morally licit, know.  happens ease mask mandates whatnot. 

Can stop masks push vaccination instead? get us this. huge animal reservoir… it’s going away, vaccine best way make Covid less deadly. never ever get rid Covid… forget Home Depot Bass Pro Shop  dashed line 1 2 (vertical axis) designate? viral load quantified? similar? I'm Houston I've seen toll taken doctors medical staff interacted with. grieved feeling bad. understand family angry, truly understand gravity situation. can't say either, fully trust words. doctor cares, works hard, wants what's best patients staff. know I'm stranger internet, want tell matter happens, *never* blame medical community this.

My mom hospice rebreather plus nasal cannula (she dying cancer), much respect concerns sourcing O2. hope hefty shipment arrives sooner later.

If Houston, let know. least send staff bunch donuts snack spent better part 2 days home bed massive headache. second shot. side effect first shot sore arm. Thank level headed response. tiring watching folks assume virus super villain always plotting deadlier assault humanity. variants inherently ""worse"" us.  triage situation. Prioritize got vaccinated immunocompromised

What's fucking obscene classic triage situation, healthy unvaccinated ahead immunocompromised chances better. love Nepal! reflect state dept Heath website buyer seller negotiated price sale. LITERALLY free market. Governments dictate price going pay even multiple buyers competing product.  ""need"" travel *more*? already communicate share life friends literally world moment every day magic Internet. isolation, seem reached rather odd conclusion would share *our culture* one another, fact done this, *assure* *parochial* conclusions *far* universal. SF Bay Area used first wave, we’re mostly vaccinated shouldn’t another big wave here. masking indoors again, though, emergency notices. right. pull ten random dudes street ask describe Tuskegee experiments idea talking about. They'll probably say something airmen.

It's dumb excuse even know anything it. really think covid patients vaxxed turned away ICU full, ICU vaxxed discharged home. think rest us sick this. seems like think lot poor lazy and/or stupid.

I think lot rich lazy and/or stupid. would poor different?

Walgreens/CVS distribution important factor making vaccines accessible. I'm US centralized vaccine locations could 90+ minutes public transport people county, 20-minute drive.

I know nothing Afghan media, certainly issues around people consuming media countries.

It takes minutes get vaccine without appointment - take days recover side effects. 

I agree people competency issues *not* majority poor - competency issues tend make poor, mean overrepresented disadvantaged."
