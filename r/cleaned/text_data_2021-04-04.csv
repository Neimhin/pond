Was gonna say that. Malls PACKED. Miss third year? suggesting kids missed two years school? that‚Äôs wrong. Last spring, yes, plenty schools didn‚Äôt shit together (including mine) think could fairly argue kids missed last quarter last year; fortunately year 3/4 five whole mess started. year places opened remotely much robust program, many schools opened time short delay. Even longer delay pretty much open now. even think remote wasn‚Äôt good person (I‚Äôd agree), it‚Äôs absolutely nothing. say missed two years school exaggeration. Really want know info coming from. mention northeast believe variant referencing NJ - 200 cases total since January? hyped it‚Äôs false. vaccination isn‚Äôt key idk hell mean country probably doesn‚Äôt go dentist year anyway. It‚Äôs exactly extreme. risk reasonably small aren‚Äôt running rampant. like covid longer running rampant. aren‚Äôt yet.  Yeah also can't really directly compare current vaccines tested different times places. Johnson Johnson tested cases higher, Moderna Pfizer tested cases lower. Also tested different places, exposed different variant strains. wish would get mine prior 2022... oh well Faster, cheaper, reliable. Pick two. Nah, that's libertarian lol would stop masking COVID subsides kids still die flu, pneumonia infectious diseases? took one buddy okay feel bad CDC recommend kids 2 wear mask due safety concerns.  Like not, may incentivize getting vaccine least encourage people don‚Äôt care/think it‚Äôs imaginary. It‚Äôll tough enough hit herd immunity people straight anti-vax/ignorant No, that‚Äôs i‚Äôm saying. year vaccinated. it‚Äôll like flu. Laminating dumb, may record boosters there. put plastic sleeve like 4th grade book reports guy got kicked Disney world refusing temperature check. refuse it? literally never seen anyone fail temperature checks ever. know ever caught anyone actually covid amazon.com e-commerce website allowed posts comments. 

If believe made mistake, please let us know.

Also I‚Äôm curious completely non judgmental way: pandemic make want stop strongly smokers affected got it? mean, guess quitting doesn‚Äôt huge benefit it‚Äôs stressful time, former smoker three years part says may quit year still smoked. I‚Äôm hookah fan month, haven‚Äôt smoked hookah since pandemic began bc want lungs healthy possible.

Just curious, good luck friend! wife talking summer going look like, specifically kids since can't get vaccinated.

I'm hoping somebody comes something seems reasonable makes sense, 'cause going another year hard lockdown. quivering wreck became empty tube 

‡≤†·¥ó‡≤† Hell I've paying dental decades good excuse. Teeth need care *Sarcastic sceptic response* One time, Dr Fauci AKA DR GROUCHY knocked pregnant panda patented special move SUPER GROUCHY UPPERCUT crowd gathered, looked said ""*Coronavirus fatigue* - poor thing!"" crowd clapped gave Fauci (GROUCHY) medal. Wow. wow. Yes... that‚Äôs vaccine needles are. pinch it‚Äôs over.

It‚Äôs mostly aches pains suck This.

Its amazing adult friend wont go near sick kid, understand plague-spreading kids be.

Here comes Covid! Whats that? Oh, doesnt spread kids, dont worry it?

Seriously, wtf? Im thinking get Cold mutations kids - breeding grounds viruses, it'd far easier two different viruses share RNA kid, vs healthy adult (antigenic shift). kids ignored, get infected multiple strains Covid, new mutation. virus works. Oh I‚Äôve giving fucks credit Thanks that‚Äôs reassuring lol. say much much quicker first sounds pretty amazing Oh please. I‚Äôm college student - we‚Äôve made sacrifices. case haven‚Äôt noticed there‚Äôs global pandemic happening killed half million people country. make sacrifices protect people save lives. sucks situation throw hands pretend virus doesn‚Äôt exist- many many people going die. case don‚Äôt know, dying Covid painful scary way die. age, surely choice, yours?  They're going need lot help. academically, psychologically. comparing two COV seasons one flu link states 100 child Covid deaths September 2020.

Additionally, COV deaths children probably little overstated and/or understated flu extensive testing resources flu.

I able open link Yahoo article. I'm curious see age using children compared CDC uses. Yes. didn‚Äôt feel mine wouldn‚Äôt known vaccinated wasn‚Äôt watching arm. Keep mind people different perceptions ‚Äúinstant‚Äù - likely meant quickly. i‚Äôm sick hearing coronavirus fatigue.... UK, school authorities getting kids self-test. course, zero percent positive tests. I've realized that, someone also introverted mild social anxiety, required go somewhere else interact people actually beneficial. forced find ways successfully manage issues.

There lot great things working home, actually looking forward returning office flex schedule 2 days office, 2 3 days home. rules broken allowed Pfizer Moderna vaccine come about?

It seems AstraZenica decided bend rules stage three trials, definitely resulted failing proceed past trial phase (in US). A. generalise whole country based odd comment online.

B. data downplayed also overstated. clear association it‚Äôs anything like affluent town. Parents whined day one children suicidal. depressed. Suicidal. school remote two days week half school two days week half everyone virtual Friday. 

So schools went back full time. even two days parents flooding school social media. it‚Äôs safe open schools don‚Äôt need masks children suicidal wear mask!

They pushing mental-health agenda get way it‚Äôs asinine disservice children actually issues. 

I don‚Äôt think kids entitled don‚Äôt know parents complain extremely entitled.

We want schools open back *normal* group parents working outdoor prom senior class. can‚Äôt happen overnight like squeaky wheels demand. Russian vaccine...... idea lectures get consumed home homework gets completed class teachers helping needed. lots [data pilot integrating KA show significant improvement test scores. Without doubt, one dose Pfizer/Moderna better one dose JnJ

Aw well first half post scientifically accurate regards efficacy rates went thew window would bash someone something actually agree with? utterly asinine. oppose someone matter even matter whether like biggest fucking moron planet. 

If think vaccine passports bad bash DeSantis opposing him, exactly wrong political system. what's good bad ""team"" doing. encourage caution. referencing father would also like call resignation. There's serious entitlement comment sure fuck coming kids. üòÇ OK bub. Usa wrong nomatter what. Like I'm personally one said send vaccines out.

Once US taken care of, I'm sure ship vaccines out. need correct first. USA listen mask rule well, countries do, fine, right? Wait thought conservatives pro business small government? well said. Academy‚Äôs mobile learning app developed specifically health workers designed enable expand life-saving skills battle COVID-19. delivers mobile access wealth COVID-19 knowledge resources developed WHO, including up-to-the-minute guidance, tools, training, virtual workshops support health workers caring patients infected COVID-19 protecting critical work. neighbor 20 college athlete. developed Covid related asthma lifelong pre-existing condition. Don‚Äôt arrogant. sure hope approve vaccine children, whole year wash students.  wish. students virtual since last March continued test positive. admitted attending parties, family gatherings, working, living family members working. 

That biggest fear returning person. city school located students live one biggest hotspots one worst counties state. 

I‚Äôll fully vaccinated return, tired seeing kids getting sick. Although students eligible vaccine (as 17-18 years old), I‚Äôm sure going go they‚Äôll fully protected return. 

LUCKILY, starting opt-in basis. fear schools neighborhood aren‚Äôt lenient. this. vaccine proof safety guest workers.

If workers vaccinated, go though theater?   trolling idiot? Yah, young kids elementary school regularly give away information shouldn‚Äôt, like uncle got Imprisoned again, family illegally. Minnesotan checking in. Wisco testing lot less us good long while, according link, they‚Äôre half million tests lower us despite people. person responded to‚Äôs last point might stand due WI undercounting significant margin. MN‚Äôs testing program robust, easy, free, we‚Äôve pretty great participation. Looks like MI run gazillion tests well. brand skepticism seems like excuse lazy research required answer ones questions.

Is data long term effects vaccine that's around ~3 months research? ‚Äú...proven effectively useless variant.‚Äù

18-25 age group filling hospital beds nonexistent one made based assumptions.

If mean correlation general, could true. Biden president 4 months now. He‚Äôs plenty time get things control. aren‚Äôt going able blame everything Trump administration forever. Yeah agree, except expat used even living permanently. Mexico huge community US retirees immigrants, many undocumented, yet US media still calls expats. something proven little higher mortality flu. everyone wear masks go lives. nonsense. don‚Äôt shut economy every year influenza. commute stopped working. I‚Äôd happy time back.

(Am lawyer; miserable WFH) parents got second phizer vaccine today pharmacist. said woman administering shots barely pricked them, like instant didn‚Äôt feel anything. know nothing works enough time vaccinate someone? case surges recently. High case counts low risk population. mostly sarcastic, would imagine medically/scientifically literate average person. find hilarious people thread passionate subject don‚Äôt know shit it.  Yes. BREAKING NEWS:

&amp;#x200B;

the people vaccinate breakthrough cases we'll get. hard understand. I‚Äôd mask don‚Äôt want risk person still gets mild case despite vaccinated passes child. everyone, including kids, get vaccine, stop wearing mask get incidence low enough would far less likely happen.

My numbers also CDC well AAP, idea point trying make there.

I still want know it‚Äôs huge deal people go normal business one small extra item clothing. big thing ask? Wife work DoE. elementary, long they've re-opened in-person learning weekly randomized testing 20% school population (depending size school). They're available almost every Walmart, Walgreens, cvs. mention small minute clinics.  vaccines protect strain, full stop. if, then, but. cool. use display? Yeah luckily small group 3-4 friends hang cook weekends. definitely helped eased stress past year. businesses good reason require vaccine passport.

lol vaccine passport, colleges strict mandates vaccines forever. 2008 got hold put enrollment since primary care went business vaccination records lost completely. go back get menacta, mmr, tdap would let enroll live campus.  Ah, OK :) Last week one covid positive patients told discovered wife ill failed temperature check vaccine appointment. turned away symptoms soon began worsen tested positive. patient, although eventually covid positive, able receive vaccine day prior wife‚Äôs appointment. didn‚Äôt get chance receive hers. point spoke currently hospital several days stable. Last summer whole Europe acted like covid allowed everyone fly place holidays.

It downhill You‚Äôre right that‚Äôs literally said comment. even read it? whole point substitutes meantime.  Fancy way saying none ever end. got taste power 2020 dont wanna lose it. anything said? literally said it‚Äôs person 1-on-1 help, whether ability exists teacher utilize opportunities irrelevant opinion matter. opportunities exist, it‚Äôs easy meet people 1-on-1 virtually. kids‚Äô teachers aren‚Äôt that, that‚Äôs fault. Good everyone. arms race get behind. found stuff Astrazeneca related blood clots. found people severe allergic reaction it. Yes, short term side, specifically allergic reaction. know long term effects, vaccine studied less year. 

Again, concern long term effects. Idk, could be, need long term studies vaccines/medicines. What's likelihood chance bad? agree you, low, since thing lets produce covid-like proteins body identify easier (i.e. fuck DNA conspiracy theorist spout). risk/benefit. instance, go visit grandparent month, would certainly take keep safe, (benefits outweigh risk). though, need it.

Your point nearly 2000 dead 18-29 yo age group fair point. likely people high risk and/or comorbidities. IMO, vaccine available, doctor would recommend them. majority population, it'll fine (but people talk doctor make sure). 

Listen, I'm taking vaccine. I'm making mandatory take vaccine. People able make fully informed choice help doctor. me, I'm rush would rather wait bit case find something wrong (which again, low chance). I'd rather that, instead vaccine mandatory low risk group, ship internationally high risk groups elderly. Ex.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  Glad worked guys. Next time, try HCQ skip vaccine lines. Yeah, literally said comment wasn‚Äôt same, assume downvotes coming people pissed option right now. *screams unvaccinated teacher* I‚Äôm already vaccinated, particularly worried COVID.

The statement HCQ clears COVID hour. inaccurate. 10th amendment. Big assumption ever made though high school. don‚Äôt think Diploma requirement reddit account. pretend issue isn‚Äôt there? ""What?""
What part struggling with? I‚Äôm literally vaccinated too? I‚Äôm considerate people myself. Begone peasant ~ lot different ‚Äòeffectively useless‚Äô. suspect still provide protection severe disease death. Oh boy. go. effective treating quite things. Suddenly, last year, decided unpopular. open mind give try, stopped worrying CV within hour. Yes. ""Religious"" beliefs caused measles vaccination rates dip threshold herd immunity around country led large outbreaks. pedantic- there's clear regional skew case trends increases northern states east Mississippi epicenter NYC region.  decreases southwest. real standout bucking trend FL clever deduce based beliefs teacher would better wait next year resume in-person classes? stock piling vaccines apporoving even remotely related said? Yeah went Fluffopotamus88 social media? Name Ratliff Ratcliff. went pretty much every AU game season. practically became mascot team. passed away covid complications weekend. Kudos Google providing vaccine messaging CDC ...because another respiratory illness caused numerous serious pandemics past even less severe seasonal form array serious rare long-term effects thus best point comparison discussing frequency severity long-term effects COVID? mean time work yours. time breaks lunch yours.

It totally work like that, plan appropriately. guess quarantining jail. always heard someone got Covid, changing vaccinated people. Great news Negative money economy ocean full needles. Well, going gamble year isolation vs. lifelong debilitation age 8, parent that's pretty easy one make.

Reminder we're 3/4 way year now. hell another quarter going make different? got second dose Moderna vaccine yesterday. woke feeling great, hour later hit hard. feels flu chills, sore muscles, fever. I've resetting day, starting feel little better. Yes. That's exactly why. goes college education? Y'all can't string though Rona together without including flu. What's that? Lol, tell plexiglass. work, decided install plexiglass every desk. several problems this: 

1. spend half shift desks (which aren‚Äôt actually assigned anyone). spend rest shift mingling rest building. 
2. We‚Äôre touching common things going folks‚Äô desks anyway. 
3. plexiglass thick/big enough make impossible hear anyone, long enough fully stretch two desks. order communicate person next you, walk around plexiglass get two feet away instead six.

But hey, guess it‚Äôs good image project... [From Nature. lone specific study variant showed like 10% efficacy mild moderate illness. small study, you‚Äôd expect somewhat protective. useful severe disease death, small size study isn‚Äôt guarantee effectiveness there. solving COVID? Considering COVID hasn‚Äôt existed 50 years, no, HCQ effective 50 I'm fully vaccinated. Take anti vax fear mongering elsewhere. friends live New Zealand, Taiwan, South Korea, China, Vietnam. Life normal places long time. watched Super Bowl COVID pod. friend Shanghai watched packed bar people wearing masks. friend Vietnam worried sick elderly mother lives area US never able get spread control. Americans selfish entitled sacrifice collective good. need vaccine order return new normal? Yes. vaccine absolutely necessary prevent 500K people dying. No. America surrendered virus. sure lines - Michigan 50% higher death rate per capita Wisconsin Minnesota implying ~50% cases.

Some start pandemic care worse...but *that* much worse. need full lock since Americans fucking dumb selfish right first time. yeah that's good point Yeah feel like Indy breeding ground COVID. half capacity, that's still 125,000 fans sitting barely foot next person. it'll likely hot balls it'll basically impossible get people wear masks. add bar hopping tailgating shenanigans going weekend. add drivers driver's families crew employees. people might fine assume they'd get vaccine, feeling average race fan want get it

Hopefully find way make things safe I'd like go year sure going I'm fully vaxxed heard this?  Calling St Clair county suburb Detroit REALLY stretch. Old people country vaccinated yet Worth read: Whaaaat? Politicians (from country, I‚Äôm picking French specifically) ignoring rules whatever hell want? don‚Äôt believe it. google long-term symptom people worried COVID, add ""influenza"" end search string ""before:2020-01-01"" start search string. Pretty much thing people concerned COVID symptom coronaviruses influenza - lots people getting seeing higher incidents rates would influenza. 

Novel means new strain, completely new mutant disease. Coronaviruses around forever. Yeah right,. Except say 'cases rise', gave number timeline order magnitude. completely wrong. No. append ""in children adolescents"" end last sentence, otherwise open interpretation saying covid bad flu general. bash someone agree them? That's utterly asinine. I‚Äôll take mask allowed nbc literally referring ""indian coronavirus variant""

what news source would trust cases usual, read typically seen looking across multiple countries. care discediting him. hate people say ' always right'. CANCELLED 2019.

Which means prepared. We've playing ""pandemic war games"" 20 years, chuck plans bin. prepared regardless Trump, weren't. exacerbated everything mentioned, course. saying CDC mandate masks redneck people want wear masks?

No, I'm saying necessary. 

I'm also saying want people wear masks, mandating make people distrustful resist. least make likely vocally emphatically resist, bring supporters cause. Lmao folks Thank you, really appreciated! Thousands die blood clots every year 2,300 deaths condition 2012


This anti-vax nonsense.

UK becoming Covid free hospitalisations deaths plumetting European countries seeing hundreds covid related deaths **per day**

Yeah, 7 deaths three months vaccinations... shit, different post. Got it

Thanks private schools could largely make decisions. Many remained open throughout fall spring.  don't. find annoying he's hailed prophet, saying 'always right'. blatantly not. Fear porn. guys petty.

Fair enough. crashed car ditch he‚Äôd find way blame Trudeau it

Is taking lessons Pallister? wouldn‚Äôt trust BBC local Indian news, significantly biased reporting hope makes top didn't. transported trucks owned companies prepared moving vaccines years, mostly Andreani. Please share source thing sharing, vaccines problems handling (mostly vaccination sites) used people. delete/edit og comment. saying mean, make mistakes! there‚Äôs much misinformation everything already. Canadian, possible/ethical would drive days get vaccinated. Wow!! heard things quite relaxed Florida. never knew extent it. 

This year, I‚Äôve noticed people don‚Äôt give shit much last year covid precautions. family many others know always strict. 

For South African variant, knew people apartment building got city. wouldn‚Äôt surprised it‚Äôs circulating around. worry parents it. first offered, wanted take protection. don‚Äôt want vulnerable end. congested living threat before?? really gonna hurt cruises reelection I‚Äôd go bar still contract virus first. Yes. meant people knew two performers going Broadway, would crowd even waiting outside. CDC's vaccine card includes sorts PHI

Isn't literally name DOB beyond vaccine info? PHI referring to? double mutant variant reported bbc Surely people vaccines

Yes, happens. sometime September.

Presumably, open places earlier then. recall correctly, covid also present blood clots, even mild cases. odds probably worse 1 2 million think likely future masking making acceptable wear public sick. How? you‚Äôre already vaccinated, doesn‚Äôt affect anymore. GSK partnered Sanofi vaccine initially reason, IIRC GSK element said vaccine adjuvant sell open market anyway. obvious largest western producer vaccines either develop partner early academic biotech company one.

However chief science officer UK government former GSK employee (ex head R&amp;D), might political element Oxford developed candidate commercialised GSK. played well domestic press seeing government advisers former employer getting promising vaccine candidate lot government funding. date boob jobs Ireland Dubai get much closer home? heavily depends province(s) you‚Äôre talking many active cases re: much contact tracing be/has done America always right thing. tried everything else. Master chief??? need financially compensate people self-isolate would impact income.

Do well great news.

Otherwise, meh, we've testing 1 million per day ages UK really helped since track trace system (costing billions) considered rubbish (maybe unfairly) many people work (which probably rubbish, media partly blame here) Covi killed first lol u mean 6'2""?  another less risky one later.

And mumbai 50% patients 40(check mumbai sub posted 2 days ago). apparently bangalore 2 weeks away healthcare system shutting down(not sure data though, something read online doctor guy).I genuinely thought miracle things control. I'm scared really really tired staying inside home. casual 

Hmm... worse asked prove age. safety, someone knowing I'm vaccinated affect way. Lmao really think dose comes needle?

Yes, reuse needles sanitary reasons. Thanks, looks like b117 Michigan exclusive variant. I'm sure showing. ends clip saying people wearing masks lead shortage people need them. That's misleading. true. says people wearing masks time need be, followed saying people wearing improperly, touching faces not. That's also true.

This would put 335-1005 occurrences year. 5 percent would 16.75 50.25 deaths per year. 7 higher side expected. typical death rate UK know though. 

What clear reporting many cases occurring general would expect investigating know. certainly make clear outside things worse ever seen before.

For women child baring age reported much higher incidences cvst likely due contraceptive pill. reports women prone correlate expected clear reporting going people affected.

People also behaving differently, quite possible people died left late seek treatment would otherwise 'normal' times.

But clots effect everyone equally, chance dying covid gets progressively lower age essentially zero babies, age risk individual vaccine outweigh risks illness. jurisdictions restricting thus vaccine amongst young.

I responded post stating *""mRNA vaccines studied **decade** try again""* allowed quote studies 3 years old? seems disingenuous 2. Specifically, claiming causality sources dare claim association. 

I think am. whole bullet point section starts word identification individuals increased risk autoimmune reactions mRNA vaccination may allow reasonable precautions taken. --LIKE NOW??? THAT'S WE'RE PEOPLE SEVERE ALLERGIES - REALLY, EVERYONE!

So, sensitive detection precise quantitation anti-PEG Ab levels made **everybody** taking mRNA vaccines? Show fucking assuming correlation = causation study -

I assumed nothing. quoted peer reviewed studies rather old 

Yet still even assert association. 

Neither science works, incredibly dishonest. 

Quoting peer reviewed papers exactly science works. problem paper, publish new one response. Anyone else feeling like many Americans saying f*** moving lives COVID still around?

Theres literally data hate like pull shit ass lol yes, brain critically think say let see understand correctly. one big 3 vaccines probably die regardless variant, serious chance deadly variants could passed vaccinated unvaccinated, anti vaxxers could get completely destroyed say P1 starts spreading vaccinated population?

Depression depression, matter spin it, technology substitute socializing.

I already front computer 24 hours week school. I'm sick tired front laptop want see friends again. brainwashed ‚Äúhopefully Pfizer gets approved adolescents soon‚Äù must‚Äôve hit rock bottom anybody comments without reading article, ""expert"" Osterholm. safely ignore. India, confirm. cell scientist here. Basically threat variants much none vaccines work we'll see massive surge like March last year. threat variants drag long time reducing vaccine efficacy/sterilizing immunity. Meanwhile Texas heard people reactions Pfizer vaccine low antibodies count get tested. Many get infected after. Nobody verifying this? trial done this... test antibody levels vaccines much affects vaccine efficiency? believe determined longer require super cold temperatures. able stored refrigerators time. They've shipping Moderna Pfizer rural sites super cold capabilities heard issues asking see sound logic behind it. course understand assume paranoid concern founded statistics research exposed thus far.

It's also concern without evidence drives people skeptical vaccine too, know. cell scientist. I've downvoted many times year saying similar things. data always pointed people retaining least partial immunity basically variant COVID muster.

Variants certainly pose threat prolonging pandemic, creating virulent contagious strains, decreasing vaccine efficacy. However, idea COVID out-evolve vaccination efforts looks incredibly unlikely. would take another big, big mutation event (i.e., fortuitous recombination event) COVID outmaneuver us. types events create century pandemics. Probability overwhelmingly side. open. need stop pretending 'safe' open, instead inform public risks cost-benefits keeping open: better education kids risk/cost covid infections. Don‚Äôt let kids schools fall w/o it.
Anti-vax &amp; Anti-mask BS must crushed overwhelming science. read suggestion get little ID sleeves come attached little lanyard. way it‚Äôs protected remove need too. Yeah damned auto correct! left cause funny :P valid concern. conflicting evidence ability virus enter brain great degree, paper published January suggests virus remain dormant protected within brain. so, people could recurrent mental issues. clear, unlikely virus directly attacks neurons lack ACE receptor cause small blood clots inflammation (cytokines) area around neurons. autopsies confirming this, might explain temporary brain fog symptoms.  Best bet keep covid vaccine boosters immune system rapidly knock reactivated virus localized infections really start. *Boom.* Vermont under-15 suicides past year under-40 COVID deaths. Tiny relative production capability population size, I'd imagine. also makes sense - control internally, focusing exporting vaccine (increase goodwill &amp; ties China, well help 'expedite' return normality) seems reasonable. Speaking today first day individuals 16 older eligible vaccine state (florida) sister appointments, things going good direction terms vaccine distribution although supply would nice folks tech savvy. Indeed. 

The last part mention cannot believe cavalier attitude people have. COVID (the disease resulting SARS-COV2) circulatory disease (where respiratory primary spread mechanism): damage lungs, heart, kidneys, brain, etc. 

In way still think /u/implicitumbrella's concern valid: damage like (especially many organ systems) lead significant problems road, terrifying.

It's worth noting America future health problems going financially destroy people. best vaccines ~90% effective. bar 100 people one covid, means tjst potentially 10 vaccinated people could catch it, one might even die. Curative runs site: mention infrastructure, although, building mRNA vaccine distribution infrastructure worth ends obvious, likely know. don‚Äôt want kids get Covid-19. current vaccines keep getting covid living normal life, relief. don‚Äôt worry ‚Äúa new development terms effects covid‚Äù don‚Äôt get it. truly can‚Äôt understand would relieved vaccinated along rest us, can‚Äôt anything help understand. guess understand fine. kids. There's hesitancy there's dogmatic refusal. Vast majority spread happens within homes. wearing N95 sleep? curd immunity here. kids money tight, nice fly somewhere resort vacation 16+ years, politicians go ONE YEAR without one, smh. Worth noting 30min home lateral flow test kits super accurate tend miss asymptomatic carriers thing took Osterholm said today worry what's going school-aged children. That, appears backed apocalyptic projections fourth wave worse X-Mas. 

I think opening economy really major impact school-aged children. Schools, yes. rest economy, much. Wait. Where? I'm 20min Tulare. I‚Äôll part reason goes 2021 üëå  Talcum powder :-/ must say, fun watch people could deal would consider normality.

Oh, saw friends pub twice year? Welcome 3 kids mortgage. Remember beginning pandemic people said gonna push covid passports everyone called crazy conspiracy theorists. happening one batting eye  Yes, are. late teens early 20s already puts one lowest risk groups. Combined vaccinated, chances dying practically 0. solution, asshole, get vaccinated build herd immunity continue lockdown living fear. It‚Äôs year, fucking get yourself.  Curious hear experience European Medicines Agency currently investigation specialists different countries get bottom rare serious answer decision end week, hopefully. FTFY: want shitty minimum wage Walmart Amazon job putting years earn education skilled trade government decided ""essential"" enough. good idea get everybody vaccinated vaccinated order reduce, much possible, chance people CAN'T get vaccine contracting virus.   1. article 2018, really working 2017 data, reflect information &amp; data collected past publication.

2. disingenuous make assertions. 

Specifically, claiming causality sources dare claim association. specifically went Nature article, went ""Safety"" section, converted bullet points. left lot wording section - wording well important.

[Table article showing vaccines development time Local systemic biodistribution persistence expressed Stimulation auto-reactive Potential toxic effects non-native nucleotides delivery system components (particularly disclosed manufacturers).

 However, recent [note: 2018 prior] human trials demonstrated moderate rare cases severe injection site systemic reactions different mRNA platforms22,91. **Potential** safety concerns **likely evaluated future preclinical clinical studies** include local systemic inflammation, biodistribution persistence expressed immunogen, stimulation auto-reactive antibodies potential toxic effects non-native nucleotides delivery system components. 

On last point, here's ingredients. here's Induction potent type 1 interferon response, associated inflammation potential autoimmunity. Thus, identification individuals increased risk autoimmune reactions mRNA vaccination undertaken.

A **possible** concern could mRNA-based vaccine platforms54,166 induce potent type interferon responses, associated inflammation also **potentially** autoimmunity

Thus, identification individuals increased risk autoimmune reactions mRNA vaccination may allow reasonable precautions taken. --LIKE Presence extracellular RNA, may contribute edema pathogenic thrombus formation (blood clots). Extracellular naked RNA shown increase permeability tightly packed endothelial cells may thus contribute edema. Another study showed extracellular RNA promoted blood coagulation pathological thrombus formation.

first, 2007 studies 'newest' info topic. LOL

Another **potential** safety issue **could derive** presence extracellular RNA mRNA vaccination. Extracellular naked RNA shown increase permeability tightly packed endothelial cells **may** thus contribute oedema

Stop fucking assuming correlation = causation study - especially, including, studies rather old - even assert association. science works, incredibly dishonest. Go look data releases EUA, fucking research gone since 2018, want better understanding. Please use word surge, triggering me... get super rare think acceptable wait another vaccine may affected rush.

I, personally, 29 year old male took AZ mess began I'd still it, even now. think there's propaganda something stop average person American, thinking food comes from.

If masses knew.... would take one informative documentary shown kids, fruits, veggies, fuck show animal farms too, okay maybe suffering part. *Welcome everyone one-year anniversary 15-day lockdown* think lot people came close. certainly did. However, think it, close. voice back head going, ""things change over."" think lot people voice right now. 

I never worried suicides year. people I'm worried still shit position everyone else moved on.  Crazy downvoted stating personal experience polite way. weren‚Äôt making false claims, rude, pushing views others etc. makes sense lol like you‚Äôre getting upset losing fake internet points.

No. FDA 343 drug recalls listed website right drugs passed trials. 

To clear, I'm antivax all, fact got first shot last week. say issue turn drugs already tested approved silly. Shingles result virus stays dormant inside infected cell. complicated process old well adapted viruses pull off. Coronavirus even necessary tool this. Long covid continuing presence virus result damage illness would could, dude. bad argument. always skeptical restrictions, nonsensically, death count really shows true.

However, could never real discussion lockdown skeptics arguments so, bad. wealth real, widespread societal issues considered creating COVID restrictions. chose latch suicides, missed cancer screenings, drug overdoses, nonsensical puritanical arguments sanctity freedom. unbearable.

We definitely fucked response. definitely moved mountains COVID. definitely overreact. reacted horribly, consider real negative effects lockdowns. Then, even lockdown correctly all, wound almost worst worlds.

We forced everyone adopt sedentary lifestyle without putting anything place prevent weight gain. cause massive number early cardiac deaths exacerbating obesity epidemic.

We took kids school year basically let poor kids bad internet connections support home fall year behind peers. exacerbate problems intergenerational success socioeconomic mobility.

We crushed mental health pretty much anyone 30, married, massive introvert. probably worth it, tbh, say someone lived crippling depression year.

We widened wealth gap incredible extent probably fully recover generations.

There many good arguments things considered carefully choosing lockdown. one considered them, people critical restrictions clearly political scientific (and thus largely ineffective, leading deaths) idiots shut suicides drug overdoses.

Try arguing point. remember saying wouldn't, might wrong.  It‚Äôs year they‚Äôve kept daily cases single double digits. isn‚Äôt like US UK get everyone vaccinated get back normal. 21st amendment repeals ban, offers protection. try actually reading instead assuming says. cardiac cases young, active, healthy people especially disturbing read about. top CFR need factor risk infection specific countries, it‚Äôs low north Europe. apply ¬£500 grant told self isolate.

I covid super new. get vaccinated time age range, accept risk. That's enough. Period. None tenable people legit going bust gasket. Depression go away, mental illness pretending woopsie doopsie wish away helping anybody. It‚Äôs like affronts privacy liberties post-9/11 haven‚Äôt taught us anything. Damn, that‚Äôs disappointing.

There‚Äôs period couple weeks body building immunity antibodies still get spread virus. also percentage people don‚Äôt respond vaccine. much restrictions much general experience going once-in-a-century pandemic? Restrictions not, it‚Äôs going traumatic. Exactly. Chile using mostly Chinese vaccines despite extremely high vaccination rate, cases surging again. 

These vaccines simply don‚Äôt seen effective real live trials fishy begin with. Nope, interested. Low false positives (which good) many false negatives? controlling that? really want one. 
They right scientific experience anecdotal evidence

Sorry put bluntly. county everyone bitching non stop caring wave overdoses suicides coming.

And things opening you‚Äôll never hear people worry mental health again. They‚Äôre using mentally ill pawns justify able go Applebee‚Äôs without wear mask.  Funny user name, Venezuela living en Chile? countries use metric reporting methodology?  believe false positives require PCR confirmation

Doesn't help false negatives though pretty porous border, plenty illegal crossing trading various items time. Oh god back ‚ÄúI‚Äôm walking guys slipstream bad‚Äù level thinking now. may true comparing one population other, wasn‚Äôt intent comment. mortality rate meaningless considering single population. Deaths per capita fails take account availability quality care, amongst key factors. relevant stat hardly empirical panacea. Businesses cannot discriminate serve, serve (that crux Masterpiece Cakeshop v. CCRC decision). can't read article someone explain exception people unable take vaccine medical reasons e.g. allergies vaccine components? thromboembolic events one million narrow fx 50.... clearcut indicate. 

Good point. guilty looking total number vaccinations. That's pretty stupid error.

But crunched numbers, think actually changes conclusion, it? 

In UK vaccinated 6.5 million people 50; would clinically vulnerable individuals health care workers prioritised amongst early vaccine cohorts. can't find breakdown Pfizer AZ; overall 60% vaccinations AZ, early cohorts would predominantly Pfizer came steam faster. probably unreasonable guesstimate 2:1 Pfizer:AZ cohort, probably around 2 million under-50s AZ vaccines UK. let's ultra conservative say 1 million. 7 fatal thromboembolic events, that's ~ 1 per 140k.

But half vaccinations men, whereas thromboembolic events seem occur almost exclusively women. that's ~ 1 per 70k women. data Norway suggest 1 per 35k women, twice high guess get variations like dealing small numbers.

But even so, 1 per 35k 0.003%, still fair bit higher Covid IFR young adults. Admittedly order magnitude higher, think helps show regulators still saying benefits vaccine weight risks.

(Having said that, absolutely need investigating whether subgroups population risk higher.) childish vaccine nationalism unwanted. adults talking happened Chile? Regarding Sinopharm. people feared damaging thing you. Turns people pretty low antibody response it. sure... decrease.. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è moment, yes. we'll soon Moderna (this month think), Novavax (about approved manufacturing/distribution already set UK) probably J&amp;J Summer.

It'd make sense keep AZ supplies people already need second dose. use rest vaccine portfolio younger population. UK plenty available open 40 catagory. you‚Äôre not. Numerous patients fully vaccinated getting severe disease would huge news. It‚Äôs not. goverment not, never friend. Covid new war terrorism/drugs. That's rich. part laughing view upset? Lol NY Times usually biased trash, good Navajo managed keep virus Make sense filled COVID death, doesnt make sense all. apparently never read 21st amendment.

You tried driving. That‚Äôs less constitutionally protected alcohol is.  would sceptical sinopharm reported efficacy. wouldn‚Äôt take Chinese vaccines even offered right now, especially happened Chile. EU get 2 weeks. ‚ò∫Ô∏è 55 Millionen doses Q2 alone. Yeah. buy it. 2020 depressive year all. apperently realize alcohol Constitutional right. maybe there's agenda behind one claims. hell knows, right? guys take everything face value? week isn‚Äôt gonna make dent. Guess can't hear Category V hurricane we're in. True still somewhat expected doctors always ready treat it. sh\*t. Kids even need wear masks I'm from. stupid, considering huge superspreaders kids are. infect families, go schools/kindergartens infect kids, turn return families infect too, chain continues.

Little snotty ba\*\*ards plague incarnated. One biggest sources spread, matter disease. get overlooked. Canada üá®üá¶ FDA test available public get blood taken send away test like antibodies now. I‚Äôm done worrying authoritarian power creep health passports etc. obviously going implemented; color surprised turns next year discriminates underserved communities various minorities. Close vaccinating population Ireland day. average age Mumbai 40... Look denominator population size. China population 1.4 billion people. end March they've vaccinated [about 5% Keep mind Chinese COVID-19 vaccine two dose vaccine looking doses given. 5% vaccinated give meaningful amount immunity context nation prevented widespread infection early essentially zero natural immunity. going spread like wildfire. I‚Äôve told asking ID criminal suppression, I‚Äôm minority therefore stupid know get it. kind mental deficiency? made one original point, chose ignore, rather attack things I've talked about. disagree you, answer comment. vaccines necessarily prevent infection re-infection, provide immunity reduce severe disease upon infection. Don‚Äôt worry, plenty future generations pay back debt. made clear last year, nobody gives shit young.  Nobody knows you‚Äôre talking about. ‚ÄúMortality rate‚Äù meaningless countries aren‚Äôt testing equally. Deaths per total population tell much realistic story. 

Do truly believe ‚ÄúMexico Covid‚Äù 200x deadlier forms Covid, anywhere else world? Mexico obviously lying infection rates? asinine comment. vaccines really 90% effective we're using widely dealing variants, variants particular even lower likely see number continue drop.

So no, vaccinated mean safe sick people, means chance safe sick people.  understand virus exponential increase works mother finished round therapy CLL received vaccine two months ago. went blood test see immune response Covid. result good - less 1, means hardly immune response Covid. vaccine didn‚Äôt work her. She‚Äôll tested three months see immune response be. Overall, immune system garbage right need rebuilt. wanna protest bad stand science. think company shipping product country isn‚Äôt paying product somehow evidence nationalization solution problem? nationalized think would keep shipping vaccines countries aren‚Äôt paying? admittedly small anecdotal sample set, every affluent republican know got vaccine soon eligible \~ 15 people Northeast Ohio area. I'd say 12 15 old school fiscal conservative types, 2 15 hard core trumpies.

Of course democrat/independent/libertarian etc acquaintances also gotten vaccine. really know religious zealots, luckily really seems like least amongst folks know personally, seems hesitancy regardless political affiliation.

Hopefully outlier. Cool, please sell Canada live easy get tested especially symptoms really pointing somewhere else COVID.

So questions like harm get vaccinated? exporting half production population interested taking vaccines virus practically doesnt exist China maybe like ""that shit might work Banana Republic, Phizer!""  'vaccine' historical sense, hell then? ""The whingeing loners easy. home learning 3 primary school aged kids working home full time.""

If want accuse someone saying others allowed complain look reply. tx per capita. said ""rising"". Op needs understand facts mean. even wait hospitals flooded dying corona victims! point vaccines could used instead younger demographics severe side effects reported thus far, sign Australian government trying get them. Prime Minister Scott Morrison publicly injected Pfizer vaccine population get one. well know Astrazeneca vaccine used majority population cheaper. price list list EU paying:

Oxford/AstraZeneca: ‚Ç¨1.78 (¬£1.61).
Johnson &amp; Johnson: $8.50 (¬£6.30).
Sanofi/GSK: ‚Ç¨7.56.
Pfizer/BioNTech: ‚Ç¨12.
CureVac: ‚Ç¨10.
Moderna: $18.""

So someone's life worth $10 it? least reported outcomes studies Pfizer vaccine effective, people would preferred even low possible risk fatal blood clots known. true short term cost saving negated longer term cost Coronavirus anyway also Astrazeneca supposedly little effect SA variant, happens outbreak reaches Australia? less ""See? lockdown bad!"" ""See? need flexible work/school system handle thrive home vs in-person"". technological framework there's excuse companies still function like 1974.

That said, find report ironic since DD absolutely rife folks utterly convinced entire society obliterated mentally big meanies like Fauci said folks stay home. Even mask wearing hair war crime ""we need see smiles public"" whatever. Pennsylvania vaccinations per capita texas. ‚ÄúYou guys passing budgets?‚Äù think care even much goyim country. cell, you‚Äôd invincible reminds charlton heston said. honestly like like 10% country scapegoat everything happens ever Israeli, they‚Äôre right thread DeSantis surprised 60 minutes job asking hard questions.

Is counter argument that, people *also* shit job responding COVID, one ask leaders hard questions? Right you‚Äôre buying enough two-shot doses hundreds millions people, buying enough vaccinate two times over, price adds lol. pretty cringe anti-bobism people disagreeing frankly shocking, even care downvotes people legitimately think poor people deserve die said ‚Äústruggling countries‚Äù. Israel one maybe 20 countries aren‚Äôt struggling.

You also said pay later. Literally every business transaction happens pay later mode. Companies almost invariably give 30 90 days buyers settle payments. cascading across layers. way stop supplies buyer misses payment due credit period. Even then, reminders, negotiations on.

Hope understand things work now. hardly correlation average age, since we're comparing relative 1st wave fewer cases younger population. Every state expanding vaccine access last 6 weeks. really news. never leadership prior 2021 plan distribute vaccines (would rather spend time politicizing virus) happen fly. combination accessible 40% trumpets refusing vaccine made easier us IQ population get hold it. pandemic ended whole countries reach herd immunity. hope covax speed vaccine adminstration. 

Btw, many web sites update vaccine administration daily, similiar web site updates vaccine production world? Also, major TX cities still mask mandates place. nothing story committing insurance fraud employees. news story, skipping temperature check. issue they‚Äôve unable form government elections budgets tied up. It‚Äôs like they‚Äôre overall money. good look regardless. That's title article! Hi, I'm straw man made bag dicks! Please light fire! made statement personal beliefs, seems ridiculous blame religion many churches, especially disadvantaged communities, working bring vaccines people.

And yes, Google it, see vaccine hesitancy all-out avoidance highest among Republicans. That‚Äôs trying divisive. need acknowledge situation want improve it. example, I‚Äôve suggested Biden needs give credit Trump Operation Warp Speed.

If cared dividing nation, wouldn‚Äôt make blanket insults towards religion, American belong form. Yes comment makes sense appreciate exchange - completely agree data changes things. Instead people jumping initial thread comment vilify &amp; act like words never existed type response/exchange think would actually make others think. It‚Äôs gene therapy. agree everyone feel right,i responding claim anyone thinks differently unempathetic monster.Have good day :-) role created part failed coalition government Netanyahu Gantz. It‚Äôs stupid saying masks distancing still place know won‚Äôt be. 

But sure...virtue signal. get it;) Peopling exhausting guys like people lot. call know nothing -- problem, I'm help avoid moment introspection.

But hate you. hate way are. don‚Äôt take approach vaccine safety? go quickly easily 2 reasons:

* CSU essentially ""local"" university, drawing students Greater Cleveland area. area lots vaccine appointment availability currently, everyone state 16 eligible. point college students wants vaccine get easily. 
* largest mass vax site Cleveland already @ CSU Wolstein center \~6k vaccinations per day. 75% dumbasses named Bob started Cult Bob convinced hitting head mallet way go, would absolutely appropriate complain number people named Bob hitting head mallet.

Maybe focus changing minds cult? Presumably short-hand microbiologist related subfield specialist focuses T-cells. Scientists tend fairly specialized days. ‚ÄúSocial distancing‚Äù easy people years March 2020. change could claim making ‚Äúsacrifices‚Äù things weren‚Äôt anyways carried in-depth analysis reported comment found suitably rated.

Thank diligent service. New Jersey reporting here... past week I've seen 3 people stores masks all. seen since started, I'd say yes, lot people starting say F it. What? No.

I'm saying know AZ prevents hospitalizations death *in vaccinated* area SA variant prevalent. Cases mostly everywhere. vaccines working without doubt. number around holidays high vaccine wasn‚Äôt rolled everyone decided gatherings around holidays. rocket science. US yesterday lowest ""daily death"" count since March 23rd, 2020. I'm sure there's reporting delays causing it, still great see! We're going beat thing! 


Between new cases deaths, I'm seeing national ""surge"", pockets around country. Serious price nothing given damage pandemic wrecks That‚Äôs all? expected another zero USA price, especially since government paying. Health Ministry putting pressure government approve purchase additional NIS 3.5 billion - 30 million vaccines - even Passover government set convene last Monday. However, meeting postponed indefinitely due conflict Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Alternate Prime Minister Benny Gantz. Hey personally extremely positive worst behind us summer USA going fairly normal right current fear United States (among doom gloomers) roughly 30% adults least one shot around 17% two consider vaccine 90% efficient 10% vaccinated people virus get past combined unvaccinated population allow variants mutate create another ""wave"" help virus mutate new strands evade vaccine even more? It‚Äôs encouraging! study article doesn‚Äôt mention anything long antibodies last. would still absolutely get vaccine even I‚Äôd previously diagnosed. That‚Äôs also recommendation seems like existing antibodies might act similarly first dose vaccine, possibly one dose needed. Looks like France heading direction. 

This make think previous diagnosis moved back vaccine line still short supply. said pay later, free. Also multibillion dollar pharmaceutical company corruption gotten yet would. They're profit company. This! Way introvert stuff comments. 60 minutes heavily edited segment fit narrative. Desantis actually gave good explanation Publix chosen. Actually cases similar. 5000new cases Texas around 4000 cases Pennsylvania Ahh, got it. Thanks Good question. google Depends Canada really. seems provinces pretty well others could much better. Ontario somewhere around 0.5% per day 3.5% per week. may well voting map. know surprised. Well data directly shows significant increase drug overdose deaths, larger decrease suicides. Paywall. anyone get past please kindly post. mean? 1/3 Americans vaccinated, whole lot Americans putting lives hold protect vulnerable...who 3/4 vaccinated.

What expected do? Oh darn. teacher, looking forward people's new-found interest students IEPS and/or student mental health leading sweeping, meaningful changes (/s days) There's ton shit consider though, including (but limited to):
Risks complications someone catching covid besides fatality
Fatality rate CVST blood clots (quick google told fatality rate CVST 8ÔºÖ) risk associated complications.
Can specific causal link properly identify risk factor found (e.g. specific combination factors look for)
Risks members society delaying vaccination rollout, also basdled country's current infection levels like.

All really complicated judgement call make. Way complex than, suspect, anyone commenting reddit capable making judgement call over. get saying, much smaller country better logistics capacity always much easier time reaching critical mass. 

A rollout 4.3 million doses/day fantastic India, massive population land area mean even rapid pace, take while.  Reddit pretty US-centric general. think many countries coronavirus subs. wot Yeah, time-limited post-9/11 security theater lol what's mass downvoting many vaccinations? Israelis probably claim Pfizer blocking access vaccines Palestinians? Nope. I‚Äôm consistency, regardless what‚Äôs selected. fact aren‚Äôt telling part. mobile app Well, upside, CT residents driving buy legal weed state probably least first shot already everything cost personally feel like world maybe little bit lenient getting pandemic control instead demanding financial gain right live. 

Please consider running pharma company giving away free vaccine doses. experiences pharmacies pretty lax comes checking documentation. Wal-Greens received vaccination (Maryland) check ID, confirmation email really anything else. wanted PDF filled medical insurance it. really call exclusively considering Publix place get it. Every county specific cities got allotments distribute. Publix actually hard appointment get better luck signing people elsewhere 

Don't forget Publix also Florida company give business ""local"" chain versus CVS/Walgreens, etc? Tl;dr: America pays $39 per two dose shot Pfizer Israel pays $56 per two dose shot Pfizer. lol. serious note though reason nationalise big pharma think vaccinating 0.4% population played major role getting daily covid numbers 19 000 1 000 now? reason say skin colour (in case could said evangelicals), feel need label race title, probably put lot weight skin colour characteristics, making racist  Connecticut second holocaust worth it? No, BandNamebot. now. probably waiting daddy goyim USA foot bill usual.

FYI, shit like reason one criticize Israeli government without called anti-semitic. Basically everyone still wearing masks (at least area) know rural areas that's definitely case. restaurants also supposed like 50% capacity something they're 1000000% running full capacity. 

St patrick's day definitely added rise here, schools/ youth sports teams. 

I think things gunna get worse next weeks spring breakers coming back FL wherever else. good. I'm gonna put there, go local pharmacy, there's decent chance they'll vaccinate without parent present. already dispense birth control teenagers who's parents might board, personally know single pharmacist would refuse vaccine teenager said ""my parents anti-vax I'm not"". going use approach rent month. Wish luck! stupid statement ABSOLUTELY same. Hense word emergency lol mean, prevents denial coverage based pre-existing conditions. read exact clause law can't imagine they'd allowed deny coverage vaccinated. they‚Äôre miserable enjoy seeing people miserable. truly content alone isolated time, wouldn‚Äôt internet dunking people going rough time right T-cells magic panacea subreddit makes be. time getting T-cell related immunity already fighting active infection damage done. didn‚Äôt know given attack *religion*.... attack *freedom*, too. I've two Pfizer, side effects. Maybe get lucky. [Emergency Use Authorization basic self test kit. $180 way much.

You want get weeds address medical professionals anti-vax emboldening movements proxy legitimacy via cults personality sufficient delivery system therapies researched could target cancer cells etc. got mRNA delivery system deliver tailored cancer therapies.

As vaccine technology, also allows creation vaccines require growth given medium (like animal cells, human cells, eggs). helpful growth step sometimes influences efficacy vaccine. Better conservatives qultists refuse get outright prolonging everyone‚Äôs suffering. 77% people taking vaccine would actually good number. 77% actually gets means 23% would get theyd see friends family getting feel dumb getting it. (not some, enough get us 80% likely) [It fyi. tell doctor. studies that. true all. partner example ""self employed"", industry shit workers get rights. got ¬£0 sick pay employer, ineligible ¬£500, got fired well day supposed resume work. kept work meant additionally ineligible UC assistance.

The people need self-isolation money able access it.  allowed that? neighbors may also awaiting results. stick anything kids fully approved, kids fully vaccinated.

People reddit love stuff black white pick side fight. country paid development doses? federal law, everyone (including covid proselytizers) protected discrimination **on basis race**, yes. means race protected class comment Asian Hispanic people incorrect. 

People still legally discriminated based characteristics linked race, color, national origin, things easily googled. refused service drunk, violent, improperly dressed (unless it‚Äôs necessary adherence religion). covid stuff. rough estimate, assumption (based life insurance survey found 3√ó antibody prevalence vs. known conditions):

28.3% average + 25% Gen Z/millennials mobile, likely working customer service jobs, least likely shielding Many years research gone RNA vaccines, one reason scientists able start testing vaccines Covid-19 quickly. viral sequences revealed January, took days pharmaceutical companies Moderna Pfizer, along German partner BioNTech, generate mRNA vaccine welcome :) completely disagree. Right wrong, ship sailed many years ago.

I disagree premise saying, saying ""It's cool rights violated lost long time ago!"" false choice.

It's similar claiming TSA groping people OK always done way. No, OK never OK. invasion bodily autonomy human rights. people around us voted garbage mean consent need let continue. Ah, evidence severe outbreaks covid China now, even slightest hint it, sources all. hospitalized day game. way infected game. you‚Äôre saying Covid vaccines synonymous obesity treatment. Thank you. ability handle rigor. Pacing slowed crawl. I'm history I'll lucky hit even half curriculum.

Also, given year push academic writing. ELA counterparts busy teaching tests luxury whatever fuck want. Last year time we'd written probably 6-8 essays. Varying length increasing scope year progresses. advanced classes touched essay writing all. I'm near skills set time last year. I've done maybe 3. I've completely abandoned there's way spend time curriculum point. 

My low EC kids also usually write. I'm lucky even simple things point. completely disengage remote. Others parents complete assignments school. year that, they've fallen. Hard. 

So even cutting curriculum shit privilege most, kids simple can't keep up. Assignments would take class 25 minutes last year easily run 50+ year. simply work slower lack rigor. August planned keeping pacing. advanced kids floundered home unable handle time management perfectionist nature, average kids nothing, EC clustered kids either nothing parents flipped kids work them. 

We've tested year. Obviously. I'm tested subject anyway. kids cannot perform level could point last year. I'd put par with, best, kids November last year. think colleges requiring proof various vaccinations campus residents pretty well established medically sound. Nah, news definitely reported much dramatic way necessary generated views/clicks.

The fear-porn insane help all, quite contrary fact. Show us math! Thank you! LOL DAE LE US LE BAD?! xD sister got Pfizer Vaccine first dose Moderna second. ok?? Vaccinate moron. fine attacks religious *FREEDOM* moron. GOT IT. [You‚Äôd think dictators would avoid elections. Here‚Äôs don‚Äôt. [Washington never pay ;)

(I know nothing headline, refuse read unless it‚Äôs form series Reddit comments) may also long fight fully approved FDA. forget people waiting higher approval emergency use. Yeah we‚Äôll hit 50%+ one dose couple weeks. That‚Äôs big. Despite harsh unpopular restrictions imposed Whitmer, state much higher deaths per capita similar Wisconsin Minnesota - almost 50% nothing, instead, flurry heavy handed poorly backed science restrictions alienated community made mistrust leadership. Unknown much responsible surge, banned things like buying garden plants getting boat even fishing yourself, think irrevocably broke trust lot citizens her. gets effective time.

There's infamous ""Johnson graph"" might interest you. don‚Äôt think succeeded. That‚Äôs exactly disagree reported figures lol produce, notion ""vaccine nationalism"" probably alien them.

Sorry, seem know word means. may google it. God wish could get shot. None really address issue currently supply give 2 doses everyone world 

Add international borders even problematic Thank you. don‚Äôt really understand whole downvoting asking questions phenomena. Canada take surplus! Yes please!! got J&amp;J, can't wait feel *fucking invincible* 2 weeks! glad asked lol ""What I‚Äôm talking posts saying effect ‚Äúdon‚Äôt get vaccinated it‚Äôs beginning losing privacy.‚Äù""

I'm sure mods come across posts say that, they'll gladly remove them. think *can* seen anything legit saying otherwise. Yes, you? According attempted hide things failed, would think could succeed hiding severe outbreak? zero logic taken comment. They're also made every EU country. Still ship chief. Agreed ‚Äî initial phrasing come across way, reason, probably half asleep. course need plenty support decision-making, tho. Plantain facts. I'll show out... Sorry toot horn, think prediction vaccine availability turned right.

It essentially ""Remember hard find test spring? People saying 'Nobody find test, family needs tests! could test people needed it, we'd better place pandemic!' suddenly became 'My whole family got tested twice yesterday wait another hours results.' *really* sudden! We'll see transition vaccination. need get two shots, done! shots, testing!""

We're getting inflection point really quickly! provide link unedited segment? jeez, tough crowd. well-cited perspective article Science, written well-respected infectious disease experts. definitely fear mongering. would love see documentation legal colleges legally allowed make emergency vaccine mandatory. afford it, take Uber... wear mask keep windows open.

Or could always try posting local Facebook group Reddit sub; someone might willing drive nice maybe could barter payment.  Christians best ones attack cuz turn cheek... others... much. people need second round immunizations protection fades first round, major manufacturers producing version updated combat whichever strains prevalent point. vaccines likely date.

A better analogy would stockpiling cassette tapes there's huge demand CDs. getting 35% from? Yeah, may 2 months varying location US unfortunately longer outside US. Can't keep mitigation stuff going indefinitely people refuse get vaccine. hopefully convince get reduce opportunities spread mutate. evidence would be? went variants South Africa clinical trials.

So far AZ failing due variants.  worst-hit countries death toll atm relatively wealthy Western countries, probably not. We've got old people % population reap really historically shit governments power hobble responses. buying enough vaccinate two times over, ~~that price adds lol.~~ amount money speed process

They produce ship many vaccines per day. 

Sure, US could offered $100 per dose received first 600 million doses, 

 1. would outlandishly ass-holish country size
 2. would run limitation physicians available administer vaccines, still would taken while. country heading reopening least half population aren‚Äôt vaccinated. Right it‚Äôs younger people 0-50 years old getting sick, also population that‚Äôs least vaccinated. That‚Äôs better 50~90 year olds getting sick, there‚Äôs price paid younger poorer segment society. Actually, PA administers vaccines both, situation different. It‚Äôs excuses Israel apologists avoid responsibility international law pretending Palestinian bantustan created legitimacy. Hmmm think distinction vaccine passports intended employed people whenever enter building, students. Can't say whether distinction meaningful though I'm not. I'm saying dictators tend hold elections. think it‚Äôs huge set back idea we‚Äôre able go back normal now. NCAA tried hard everything right make things safe, legacy now... generation long stain. said everything done right would safe, something like happens. 

Probability complicated, crazy see someone actually write passages April 2021. absolutely obvious anyone following media masks social distancing reduce transmission, stop completely. idea somehow revealed one case sports team could position promise 100% safety mental. 

Try get terms fact covid cases even deaths going forward. True zero covid, eradication, cards. balance safe enough. sad case, sucks them. will, we'll need able deal idea less perfect safety. 7 day average deaths 9 they've several rclecent days 0. new cases 177 yesterday still dropping. pandemic Israel barring new variant escaping protection vaccines. suggest covering it? wanna go nuts tinfoil theories fully lol obviously pay full price anything There's - beyond immunocompromised people mentioned /u/worstpossibleworld19, there's also potential need boosters. 

Let's assume vaccine efficacy declines time boosters needed (which, yes, know sure yet). perfect world, 99%+ people got vaccinated, need boosters would minimal least could likely go longer them. Instead, 75% vaccinated, likely need boosters much frequently overall ""herd efficacy"" (essentially percentage resistant overall) starts lower quarter people refusing vaccines.

A high proportion unvaccinated people also cause random spikes, increasing chances regional lockdown affect vaccinated. *with vaccines They‚Äôve testing university since august. Completely accurate numbers? sure, literally country does. example, US 150,000 deaths reported January 1st. 

Cases China original wave year ago vastly misrepresented that's secret. real number would've like 10 fold reported one(mainly bc testing capacities)

But implying China hiding cases acting like nothing much more, well, that's happening basically impossible Imagine thinking good argument somewhere point history Humanity worse you, really feel bad"".

That's dumb sound. First said majority disagree say divided. Citation needed. Another great point. Tensions Finance Health Ministries issue growing recent weeks. Finance Ministry substantially opposed Health Ministry‚Äôs demand state purchase large number doses, limited shelf life, views request associated costs high ‚Äî far reasonable safety margin state mean I'm jewish lazy joke, tell something good I'm happy live eu. Half bought vaccines go countries can't afford it, unlike selfish America UK. care people makes sense let selfish countries pay premium. need reopen. New variants continue pop decades. probably escape vaccine, leading influx cases get boosters. can‚Äôt shut schools cases low possible future threats variants. Wow! Really? Profiteering middle pandemic? low corps sink? Can't Israel owe one something? People dying! Biden help plz know control Palestinian Authority, Hamas. situation different. received Saturday. made feel fatigued 4 hours later 14 hours later felt like bad cold carried Easter Sunday today I'm feeling fairly good. gotten much sleep since getting shot I'm assuming side effects keeping up. noted surgery week prior cleared doctor get vaccine did. may contributed side effects. Germans fucking stupid.

As German, deeply offended. right. Vermonter, no, Bernie impact state's attitude towards pandemic. That's criticism. really role senator. 

Most agree Vermont Governor Rick Scott's leadership amazing. Obviously, critics complicated situation, overall view leadership pandemic positive. strange see statistic. 

For last 6-12 months dialogue flooded people pointing badly extroverts suffered lockdowns. 

Turns truth far nuanced. one know fact folks suffered, feel them. also know many others found freedom office retail work fairly liberating.

Hope learn adopt large-scale telework hybrids varied personality types Thank sharing. work home, I'm concerned feel well day two. ton sick time really feel well, wanted get general idea expect since I've heard Pfizer Moderna. Gotta use foot getting information social media still? actually uncommon events cause *societal-level* stress see people exhibit resilience, though looked research enough see they've ever pinpointed reason.

I suspect that, like comments suggested, seeing lots people going thing makes easier deal with. problem widespread affects everyone, people willing talk openly difficulties.

A lot suicides probably result stigmatization factors (mental health, poverty, etc) usually correlated with. I'm sure big impact, overall shitty make executive decision ""customer's"" behalf instead following FDA approved guidance. 

Also - GO Pack! Mine today 4 weeks. big deal life goes on. Thank love someone makes crackpot statement goes reality evidence rationale, another commenter posts actual expert field providing actual realistic insight matter, original crackpot poster comes back talking unicorns absolutely source.

You've really swayed going reality unicorn talk. Bravo. heard side effects usually develop within 12-24 hours getting shot. mom developed side effects around 12 hours second shot. Smokers tested positive COVID-19, deal smoking? People deserve right cause harm others believe pseudoscience vaccines. *earth* people okay bodily autonomy comes this? 20% population bunch plague rats blindly believe vaccines going control microchips nonsense.

Their bodily autonomy jeopardizes themselves. kind passive pseudoscience support would‚Äôve stopped us wiping Polio Smallpox. forget there's legitimate reasons vaccinated too. guess important call people stupid think Working certain job qualifies here, majority service working friends fully vaccinated minute. job reopened sadly qualified. Early 40s, overweight, generally healthy got JNJ last Monday afternoon. Headache sunset Monday night, woke Tuesday morning duller headache previous night, body aches increased day, accompanied jelly legs lots fatigue. Woke Wednesday hint headache body aches gone mid-day.

DOESNT MAKE SENSE THOUGH! vaccines 100% efficacious! good friend caught roommate fully vaccinated month ago. happens, long vaccinated people think they‚Äôre 100% immune cannot spread (therefore don‚Äôt wear masks/are lax rules) woods. Herd immunity way masks. There's difference anti-lockdown refusing sort measures put place. I‚Äôm higher education employee Illinois, able get in. Russian numbers always suspect. Please stop fear-mongering. teachers at-risk populations vaccinated. findings merely underscore kids eventually vaccinated, too, especially since variants inevitable. remember used important us lead. guess middle pack OK days. :-( encourage mask wearing? Maybe missed one many handshaking tours without one. Makes sense. I'm surprised high makes zero sense guess 23% millennials don‚Äôt want travel internationally then. It‚Äôs priority that‚Äôs problem. Europe supplying world alone. China, Russia (until recently) India also export lot vaccines. know someone get vaccine looooves rave/festival scene even think this. probably put way worse shit body.

Even younger 16, 12-16 year olds probably eligible 2-3 months Pfizer least. trial data solid. - know whether actually need boosters, 6 months high number. would probably like year two, already flu.

- Even happen, humanity build collective resistance virus time effects gradually lessen. Almost nobody dying 50 years, would true even vaccinate all. theorized common cold coronaviruses circulating mostly harmlessly today started hard-hitting pandemics like one past.

I referring mRNA vaccines, vaccines EUA using SARS-CoV-2 vrus.

The mRNA gone days. spike proteins made cells gone weeks. There's nothing left effect weeks, know side effects vaccines already. remarkably safe effective.

Infections linger, cause hidden damage vaccines can't do.

More way you‚Äôre snarkily replying makes think coming place ‚ÄúI deserve more, I‚Äôm good noodle, I‚Äôve done everything right, x person didn‚Äôt EARN vaccine.‚Äù  chose imbue things importance.

I've five-year-old student wearing one perfectly every single day far year. (He virtual class daycare.) mom started year telling gets frustrated, sit still, throws tantrums. seen since first week, he's kept mask 100% perfectly great surprise.

Kids follow safety rules. ones given parental support need so. got 103+ fever - even 4 ibuprofen, worse chills life, speeding heart rate, pounding headache, lost ability pee 12 hours (which painful)...

it may J&amp;J thing, friends covid also much worse side effects not. It‚Äôs not. feel like train wreck hit full force. don‚Äôt understand tbh. Sure thing, champ. State death certificates mean nothing little world, guess. states, overly broad vague counted medical condition. example, MO, used umbrella term developmental disabilities specify vulnerable group phase 1B. intent people Syndrome states done, exclusive people conditions like ADHD, dyslexia, etc., qualified technicality / loophole, especially willing drive hours away rural areas vaccines were.

Some states also loopholes like that. people JNJ vaccine regarding side effects? 

I'm getting tomorrow part general population NH confirmed I'm getting one. I'm healthy late 20s. 

My wife got Moderna first day available state perfectly fine. Bad (or maybe good?) attempt trolling 2nd yet got really tired sleepy, midday first shot Saturday morning . shot location pretty sore. similar effects first? risk already chance get vaccine every state. clearly don‚Äôt understand roll working. Honestly I‚Äôve read email like 10 times last 3 days excitement. missing it? don‚Äôt see anywhere says vaccine used. people already received it, hence states opening every single person. Multi-year contract maybe? Without sources, someone reading conversation, doesn't

Simple that. strong relationship question could end it? Lol. People plenty extremely valid reasons trust another word governments ever again. mean believe opposite, many people become matter ""show, tell"". explain you‚Äôre naive reasons refusal boil misinformation Facebook

Yep, big issue here. friends legitimately believe MRNA vaccines particular ""alter dna also make sterile."" US seems pretty middle pack countries outside east Asia Oceania tbh. 16 yrs older ,or fall? so, yes, definitely agree able vaccinated fall. FYI, currently Pfizer vaccine USA approved use individuals 16 17 yrs old Something close injection almost certainly unrelated. early side effects present several hours, least. 

More likely pollen season result going somewhere get vaccine. introvert, safely say around shitty people far stressful sitting book.

A good chunk coworkers lost minds last year. They‚Äôve become horrible can‚Äôt talk anymore. 23% Republicans said would ‚Äúdefinitely‚Äù get vaccinated, another 21% said ‚Äúprobably‚Äù won‚Äôt get Covid-19 vaccine made available Republicans white evangelical Christians likely say get vaccinated, almost 30% group saying ‚Äúdefinitely not‚Äù get shot.

Stop apologist. Whenever stories reinfection, many comments effect of, ""it's probably reinfection, worry, likely recovered tested negative several months relapsing."" I'd much concerned illness lies dormant reactivate time virus catch (and fully clear) once, maybe I'm unusual. dipped 20% 20% span basically right, referring significant amount people gone ""maybe/somewhat likely"" ""yes/extremely likely"" span. get 80% country wanting vaccine, would huge Schools open haven‚Äôt vaccinated, isn‚Äôt surprise. Yeah, that's rough. best service friend may talk vaccines while. Craziness Covid vaccines frayed ended friendships. Fingers crossed happen friend comes around. No. 30 BMI 43% Americans. 75% Americans overweight/obese rn. Used 72% quarantine weight gain I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs 75% rn. Slightly muscular without extraneous fat make anyone overweight much less obese. say overweight shouldn‚Äôt really shameful since it‚Äôs pretty easy slip pounds. say someone never overweight. obese different matter. takes overweight first deciding doesn‚Äôt matter continuing gain weight excess consumption. doesn‚Äôt matter it‚Äôs junk food healthy food. eat less it. meanwhile obesity harbor higher viral concentration, breathe heavier also releasing viral bodies air around (there studies posted Reddit) due gluttony bother stay healthy wait vaccine doses. There's really nothing do. people choose ignore objective reality there's absolutely winning people. think best option say going respect anti-science stance, recognize amount data information change minds. Mine hit like brick 12 hours later. miserable day done. Interesting. I've known people killed year rest life combined guess I'm outlier. less 10% population. per capita standpoint, yes they‚Äôre poorly. I'm personally okay sporting events concerts. non-essential activities significant risk outbreak. 

Pubs feels little much, given typically much smaller worst case horrible. Cold/flu season saw worst wave pandemic like everyone predicted would. summer months represented lowest rates spread thus far. can't predict exactly ""4th wave"" look like over, certainly going far smaller fall/winter.

As far Southern Hemisphere, bit specific. Countries like Brazil equator see much temperature change season season. large Southern Hemisphere countries like New Zealand Australia practically eliminated virus borders. look Chile though, one southern countries, [biggest wave thus far last fall they're heading larger one. 

Plus studied systematically already. 

[The role seasonality spread COVID-19 find COVID-19 infectivity mortality SARS-CoV-2 stronger colder climates, COVID-19 seasonality pronounced higher latitudes. Honestly idk state california yes, store, also pharmacy, get doses, tell I‚Äôm protected, well HR, use turn tool don‚Äôt see grocery store food worker, closest thing see commercial agriculture. back list one misses appointments, store require us vaccinated go work, optional. people work complain wear mask getting actual vaccine. first lock downs last year considered essential business pretty much store open shopping center. gave us 2$ emergency worker per hour pay bump, took away July 4th last year. counties close know tried 5$ pay bump doubt would happen us. Still trying hardest get vaccinated every day though it‚Äôs tough try middle shift though  I‚Äôd imagine would either month-later basis, or, like AZ‚Äôs, closer three months. trick getting efficacy adenovirus vector vaccines (as understand; I‚Äôm expert take grain salt) space doses longer period time, prevent immune system recognizing vector generating lesser immune response result. 

(Note: don‚Äôt think applies Sputnik V, since use two different adenoviruses‚Äîhence 92% efficacy given doses month [or two weeks, can‚Äôt remember top head] apart) can't keep two populations residents separate COVID purposes. We've tried failed. long-term problem, could move people new vaccinated-only facility different rules. long-term problem, wait little solves entire resident population either fully vaccinated declined (which likely imminent). Meh 1k I'd think right. wanna waste time get shot could make feel like shit day two. Assuming covid already. gotten yet, apparently I've damn good catching it. Masking stuff.  
Basically yes call lazy risky that's fine.

In case, it‚Äôs multiple good reasons. mean ‚Äúyounger‚Äù ...?

This would bad AZ, disastrous COVAX, cataclysmic UK. 

Not gonna happen. Except, virus originated China. good locking it, escaped.

There's scenario incompetence cause worldwide problem. Countries like New Zealand Singapore locked well, SOURCE much greater responsibility. arguing brick wall. Facts matter people, heard truth fox that's believe in. technically also applies J&amp;J one stretch bit. Fake news! political game EU smear AstraZeneca! /s mean report says production begins Wednesday new sites, noting would destined EU, I'm guessing additional Q2 increase (unless already factored in). Hopefully clarity updates provided coming days/weeks. Also, agree phase AZ EU better end. delivery fuckups + media coverage they've gotten made LOT people extremely reluctant get it. looks like it‚Äôs good thing terms variants. Pfizer, Moderna, Johnson &amp; Johnson use prefusion spike appear well South African variant. AstraZeneca uses postfusion appears poorly.  dont vaccinate kids open schools expect? ...most people died vaccine even available People aren‚Äôt going live restrictions much longer. think will, wrong. believe society declare pandemic long scientists already commented another post citations. I'm research takes 5 seconds find peer reviewed paper.

Stop using excuse please start listening local health officials. Well interesting. UK loudest voice claiming claims Norway Germany BS. denial you? work relevant field - believe number something saw study months back. ongoing research topic, new findings may accurate comprehensive. Looking around newer data, see still [general agreement elevated risk need 

There number surprising trends we've seen suggesting post-acute COVID risk long term systemic. real world testing saw 80% efficacy 1 dose 90% 2 doses. may seem like lot difference 1/5 people 1/10 people catching it. left, guidance strongly advise Canadians cancel postpone non-essential travel plans outside Canada. time travel.

The feds telling people travel year.

If left November, knowingly took risk.  Wow. That's something heard happen while. Anyways, vaccines work people. Go get them. could agree more! wealthy Canadian could afford go US get vaccinated, would never, ever complain 3-night hotel stay return. I‚Äôd super exited sure!

If want go see family Norway quarantine week hotel, vaccinated not. think it‚Äôs fair one rule everyone travel discouraged point. 

By summer things changed anyway. know number people personally vaccinated. soon Florida strain think natural seasonality patterns (having due weather seasonality social activity) may bigger factor. upper midwest northeast looking worst US - time last year. Geography consistently much consistent correlating factor state governmental interventions. Hey look AZ haters, working :) mean, don‚Äôt know anything stuff worked hotel point prices supposed low there‚Äôs one. like 100$ less, 600$ per night, doesn‚Äôt make sense pay much demand really. plan change US things. Companies want people receiving 4 vaccine doses, effect Canada planning permanently ban travel US US citizens residents Canadian citizens vaccinated US. source indicating exists central database Names/Social security numbers vaccination status? I've never seen claim.

Nor think possible given current system. Even glean every piece PII vaccine card, hardly identifies unique individual. grandparents last people I‚Äôd expect take vaccine, took soon able to. point Canada worry much almost entirely unvaccinated population within borders opposed vaccinated population outside borders. 

After fully vaccinated pose almost zero threat. really insist going overkill safety aspect require proof full vaccination + negative test. quarantine needed. US CDC updated accordingly. Yeah... maybe diminished immune response first dose give second dose potential response trigger... I'm totally making think I'll tell myself!  numbers across much world suspicious. cases fallacious due low testing ability. believe India less cases US, example, good luck getting Russia China report things bad are. First off, can‚Äôt many people affecting. don‚Äôt want believe vaccine cards, calling pharmacy/state get proof? got vaccinated retail pharmacy, that‚Äôs like 5 minute phone call.

Second, instead making laws say quarantine pay money, make laws say it‚Äôs illegal provide false records. providing false vaccination records results jail time, won‚Äôt issue. Great new! I‚Äôm vaccinated tested positive antibodies. right, measures place went cases 300s consistently back 1000s, silly dumb ass hoosier brain assume mass gathering people cause rise cases. states enough willing people take opened restrictions everyone.

Ok Trumpy yeah it'll low I'm sure things crank hard week make up. saying require passengers crew vaccinated trip (and vaccine administered least two weeks prior) don‚Äôt see big problem this. would hope government would come something let companies verify vaccination status little harder fake current paper cards though. take guess. Vaccines preventing likely hospitalized hospitalized since first ones receive them. mask mandate political gesture governor cant force people wear masks force private business allow mask less people in.

Schools England open since 8th March cases still declining. 23yo, don‚Äôt see importance vaccinated COVID, chances dying low might stop using car I‚Äôm going cautious life. spend days outside, immune system beastin‚Äô respect get vaccinated, don‚Äôt see point I‚Äôm anti-vax. got vaccinated bunch things keep Covid Sure thing Mussolini There's evidence Indiana ""spiked hosting it."" entire region plateaued late February seeing increases now, Indiana looking Ohio, little better Illinois, MUCH better Michigan. there's reason say NCAAs cause Indiana's slight increases. J&amp;J different technology. Viral vector piggybacks different virus. thought less effective body might naturally fight delivery virus. Doesn‚Äôt make sense you, aren‚Äôt Canadian.

It makes sense Canada can‚Äôt guarantee vaccines put arms US. fact many people lie, suddenly sounds like reasonable policy.

Especially since put place specifically discourage travel. Hey, can't imagine government exporting vaccines they've highest number cases start pandemic. country due receive vaccine covax facility emphathise hope advanced economies contribute facility too.  Well listen rhetoric folks using:

* afford it
* jumped line
* Wait turn

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* good side this; 77% vaccine hesitant generations around said no, that's probably enough. fly, already need provide \*actual\* passport. fly certain countries, already need provide vaccination records certain diseases. Let guess, never complained things one year ago? That's true, every government fucks try opposition, fucks again

Rinse repeat ü§£ Honestly, identify anymore either thought anymore. tied ideologies. Seems good Canada risk seniors get vaccinated abroad since supply limited.  Let's get one thing straight. Myanmar people innocent this. bad military. karma coming back home biting butt. 

You‚Äôre really going give crap saying stupid comment is? condemned entire population Myanmar basically said deserve die. Republicans also less likely educated vs Democrats. 9 10 poorest states Republican states. somehow even states without income taxes, public healthcare, etc ... still poor af. Maybe cuz they're dumber? What's wrong bro? facts think trying say good weather helps...people outdoors more.  Yeah... seems like might make sense providers say something setting vaccine appointments, know anyone would know without following vaccine news pretty closely. *had* following news, still forgot. snowbirds already proven follow rules guidelines. would blindly believe actually received vaccine? Probably have, quarantining two weeks small price snowbird pay society safe. US gong show helped create variants locking following mask wearing. Selfish people alone track produce 750m BioNTech/Pfizer vaccines Marburg plant every year.

While there's reason believe *won't* happen, sort misleading say Marburg plant *on track* delivering vaccines second half April. saw say another comment human behavior important seasonality. That's something pretty much everyone agrees with. Seasonality mean magically disappears summer, means infection slightly tougher else equal good thing heading better weather people spending time outside rather inside. 

Sometimes make assumption incomplete information right every reason believe warm weather helps reduce rate infection. one saying cases can't spike warm weather. one factor though, fact vast majority adults vaccinated US months much important factor 4th wave resemble awful winter deaths likely keep falling, worse stagnate falling again. 

We reason doom gloom 6 months, situation dramatically different silly pretend facing situation. Countries lagging behind US vaccinations certainly proceed little caution warm weather going magically save gathering mass. even millions doses right minute, would months could administer enough make difference.

Not true. actually pretty great vaccination infrastructure, nearly enough doses right now. Florida, Canadian snow birds getting COVID shots, vaccine passport. Agreed. know whose idea give similar names. Proud Gen-Z pro-vaxxer Almost feels? Add nice ‚Äúpolitical contributions‚Äù winner. folks go Palm Springs winter live community mostly mobile homes. also communities park models super small even cheaper. It‚Äôs good option people without lot money know lot Canadians drive months year find cheap places. So, yeah every snowbird super ultra wealthy. harder people without cars without abundant time/flexibility schedule vaccine

I know live, area they're literally driving around poor/minority neighborhoods cities pop-up vaccination tents churches, schools, community centers. states/areas shame them.

Edit: also volunteers giving rides without licenses vaccination centers. able link articles studies regarding 3 month interval BioNTech Moderna vaccines? tried find could find stuff AstraZeneca. **BRAVO JOINT, BRAVO! MEASSURE (NO PARANOIA, THINK IT) ASSHOLES TRYING KILL US WEARING MASKS, CONGRAGATING GREAT NUMBERS, OPENING THINGS FAST (YEA CAPITALISMO!) FACE YET ANOTHER SPIKEROO!

I could give fuck die Covid they‚Äôre dumb get vaccinated. die, friend family member dies heart attack stroke couldn‚Äôt get medical care, morons clogging hospital, wasting resources that‚Äôs something problem with. Even it‚Äôs pay higher taxes insurance premiums direct result peoples stupidity, that‚Äôs something problem with. Better hurry vaccinate then. reopening continues states regardless. 8th January 300,000 cases day

Oh, made mistake. You‚Äôre stupid, you‚Äôre propaganda bot. chose date reason - cases began falling day later. 

I hope money worth it. Selling integrity. maybe never Bill Gates‚Äô 5G death rays?

So proud bosses finally taught beat conspiracy theorists. It‚Äôs one yourself. Yea resonates couple replies. definitely societal pressures lifted made introvert easier, still miss people society. 

Ultimately even wanted isolated forever, don‚Äôt want clear, wishing others it‚Äôs clearly distressing awful.

I may leapt defend introverts really people taking issue anti-social people, thats bit theme replies.

Thanks feedback, agree. great day! Great work! Thank creating  group probably see heavily impacted even shot, continue social distancing wearing mask states. surprised. Hoping works , need eradicate much spread pain ass virus possible. What‚Äôs even weirder China actually better vaccines Sinovac. It‚Äôs Chinese vaccine lowest efficacy inconsistent results sure originally read that, decided see find specific number verify confidently stating false information. good interpreting studies directly finding references miles minutes.

(i think agree long distances non-commuter busses stressful cars, heh)

so gives examples things roughly line 30-40 minute claim, seems like there's room different interpretations, addition individual people years living America (I grew country really quite good public transit networks), look back -- worst times life mentally strongly correlated times drive most.

i def think something underestimate damage on. like option able save enough money retirement commuting 45 minutes twice day 15 years, would would pick first one literally sacrificing physical mental health put money bank, one things people see normal expect deal with. Yes got it- they‚Äôre vaccinating giving antibodies, they‚Äôre both. understand downvoted. least, paedophil /s  Oh boosters coming... suggest sitting next bar. new formulation entering clinical trials Brazil, Mexico, Thailand Vietnam could change world fights pandemic.

A new vaccine Covid-19 entering clinical trials Brazil, Mexico, Thailand Vietnam could change world fights pandemic. vaccine, called NVD-HXP-S, first clinical trials use new molecular design widely expected create potent antibodies current generation vaccines. new vaccine could far easier make.

Existing vaccines companies like Pfizer Johnson &amp; Johnson must produced specialized factories using hard-to-acquire ingredients. contrast, new vaccine mass-produced chicken eggs ‚Äî eggs produce billions influenza vaccines every year factories around world.

If NVD-HXP-S proves safe effective, flu vaccine manufacturers could potentially produce well billion doses year. Low- middle-income countries currently struggling obtain vaccines wealthier countries may able make NVD-HXP-S acquire low cost neighbors.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs staggering ‚Äî would game-changer,‚Äù said Andrea Taylor, assistant director Duke Global Health Innovation Center.

First, however, clinical trials must establish NVD-HXP-S actually works people. first phase clinical trials conclude July, final phase take several months more. experiments vaccinated animals raised hopes vaccine‚Äôs prospects.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs home run protection,‚Äù said Dr. Bruce Innis PATH Center Vaccine Innovation Access, coordinated development NVD-HXP-S. ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs world-class vaccine.‚Äù problem monoclonals, you‚Äôre specifically targeting one epitope. they‚Äôre highly specific. unvaccinated rude people population continues host new variants, new monoclonals keep making eventually able keep up. 

Also cool data that‚Äôs supposed come (pre print now) vaccines seem strong cell (like, CD8+ particular IIRC) response. people might suppressed antibody responses (read: B cell) HIV etc, might still protection. think combination vaccine monoclonal cocktails interesting, worry population lot. Also fact space monoclonals vaccination makes tricky. Would cool could make vaccine focused targeting cell relative epitopes too! think rhetoric dangerous. referring people want COVID vaccine anti-vaxxers. That's fair, accurate assessment. doctor gives vaccines living nervous fact would one first get thing. wanting vaccine whipped together months time lightning fast testing phase completely different weirdo wanting polio vaccine measles vaccine around years. 

For record, already gotten doses Pfizer vaccine, got trepidation. never seen article providing little information. know Sanofi factory Frankfurt, Germany, used fill finish Biontech. evidence voter fraud. 550,000 dead Americans covid, lol.

what clear potential abuse? specific. think anyone surprised point lot fearful, paranoid people there. think much less likely people spend much time bars (or socializing all), doubt catch on.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* think countries lessons learn this.

Sadly lesson never depend US mutual cooperation. crisis force local companies choose national partners even could get better ones internationally fuck everyone else.

The US far ahead without getting Pfizer Biontech UK pushing UK based producer AZ. Honestly haven‚Äôt building since March 2020. church friends keep vaccinated, obviously liked minded friends. announcements one way far church stance. believe nearly hospitalizations Chile unvaccinated people. they‚Äôre using lower efficacy vaccine meaning vaccinated larger amounts population see effect population level. I'm really sure data statement coming from, certainly examples vaccinated people carrying virus. Transmitting another question, statement mentioned. 

I interpret mask wearing theater general public safety anything, large number people still unvaccinated. say vaccinated people stop wearing masks, people claim vaccinated order wear mask. Lockdowns prevent hospitals overwhelmed help buy time restock PPE, allow healthcare professionals rest recover, implement contact tracing, vaccinate people.

The time bought previous lockdowns squandered result lockdowns. CCP would never let us down! I'm sorry really missed opportunity ""they took jabs!""

It's OK, I'll let warning time. Cool seems like agreement then, offense taken.

People taking joy others suffering messed up, one introvert represent, I‚Äôll stand it.

Thanks respectful dialog, rate day, great day! believe common variant Chile B.117 (same variant dominant Israel). B.117 greatly susceptible currently approved vaccines confirm, fortunately planned ahead time Friday. Worked really well. - much larger percent Texas Covid lax measures. Nice weather closer herd immunity infections vaccines reason. likely spike though week two.  people stop Well even 15% fatality rate 80+ yrs still means 85% survive seeing high risk people who've gotten problem uncommon. That's I'm glad places like Texas opened everyone. Zero stigma. people getting vaccinated. Read article - good doctor‚Äôs statements full ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt know‚Äù. 

The bottom line one questions 2 better 1. question getting 1 person 2 shots right better getting 2 people 1 shot second shot little later. UK studies support 1 second line. starters didn‚Äôt downvote alts. I‚Äôm guessing downvoted could pretend upset?

Why virus continue surge numbers?on 23rd October 85,000 cases day US. 8th January 300,000 cases day

How explain this?

Is Bill Gates‚Äô 5G death rays? people admit that, would also acknowledge risks they‚Äôve forced students teachers take year. Sorry, intend way could see read way. mean set debate word ""meaningless"" lol. 



To clarify, meant like playoff game hugely significant game since many season. also get many fans value home opener, I'm guilty shortsighted there. bad! Definitely condemning anyone though. think interesting event historic year.  can't overstate enough important is, even wait weeks worth get people vaccinated.

California's agriculture industry absolutely huge west coast, national goods, food supply. often fill declaration forms international borders kinds things. stiff penalties lying, especially bringing goods Canada looking tax dollars. vaccine declaration anyone lies, get fined $20k something. Canada customs diligent inspecting proof vaccines looking goods charge GST/HST/PST/Duties. Yeah still spread immunocompromised people children can't get vaccine yet. 

Better implement vaccine passport keep anti vaxxers traveling entering crowded areas without social distancing. cases enough safely reopen everyone. I'm selfish then. see friends, throw parties, break curfew law visit mum dad regularly like normal human being. Life stopped COVID. thing changed wear mask inside keep distance towards vulnerable people(old ppl). favor look pure datas, overall deaths per year changed get 2-10 deaths daily 9 000 000 people live i'm chosen one it. want know selfish? Patents. want know owns them??? company sells vaccines give break bossman  I'm buying it. company definitely financial interest pricing worst case scenario, I'll take wild claims like ""covid causes alzheimer's"" barely around year gigantic truck load salt.

I would almost guarantee significant confounding variables here, glaring people 65 assisted living homes would almost definitely likely develop dementia related illness. know quickly covid moved homes. Make sure hydrated far possible able get good nights rest. take OTC painkillers getting vaccinated symptoms; recommended shot. Plus lot took advantage economic downturn 2008 bought cheap condos, mobile homes even houses Florida, Arizona Southern Texas. drive motor homes trailers park communities places like Yuma super cheap. hit like TRAIN think could Chinese vaccine garbage? would crazy. Also, variant less susceptible vaccines Fans actually required mask per WWE‚Äôs policy.

Only 1/3 vaccinated Super Bowl? That‚Äôs enough prevent spread meaningful way. guess what? SPIKE CASES.

Seriously people, don‚Äôt want go, don‚Äôt go. it‚Äôs goddamn YEAR. Let people choose risks want take! also probably contributes spread variants. Update: Six hours right second shot. weird leg thing, napped. wanted nap in... even sure long. Still fully awake, could sleep more, wanted watch Mets Opening Day 7 TV soooo haha. Still convinced it. Let's see hour 12 24 talk haha. Anecdotally, seen lot people behaving BETTER, strangely enough. lot less chin diapers noses out. Seems like people fence wearing either a.) went totally maskless b.) don‚Äôt feel like rebel badly wearing correctly Even so, unless business public traded stock market, whateverthefuck want service policies Actually read another thread thatit even production like assembling guy gets fear mongering. actual data back he's saying. Hell, even Fauci said probably last uptick we'll have.  talking adult population. Also Covid continues low risk 16. general cruise ships way less safe airplanes hotels HVAC system works, long periods close quarters.

Cruise ships fine, fine get people vaccinated.

I didn‚Äôt say otherwise, I. Well no, that‚Äôs true all. 

Think it. you‚Äôre exposed virus, it‚Äôs going coming mucosal surfaces nose mouth. What‚Äôs stop don‚Äôt circulating antibodies? Certainly memory B cell...those waiting lymph nodes spleen. Sure *can* make antibodies again, aren‚Äôt even going know need you‚Äôre well truly infected. Yup. 

Basically every western country failed contain variety half measures. way beat thing totalitarian lockdowns, respected contact tracing, hard border closure one two. 

Consider fact Germany lot closer America New Zealand numbers proof above. Yes adult Europeans. *Checks case/death numbers* Hmmm....looks like pretty line US Exactly.

And people forget general population leave house work.

Mechanics, hospital workers, warehouse workers, line cooks, retail, etc. Heck, Walmart employees 1.5 million people alone US.

Fed state governments setting restrictions, millions people moving ecosystem everyday lot 3 shift around clock work. blaming them, everybody right work need work. 

Restrictions probably little. Walgreens. appointments Pfizer vaccine ThriftyWhite pharmacy 4 weeks apart.  long decrease efficacy bug me, come - modern programming languages native date calculation support. \`if\` statement somewhere probably one source file

Same. called see could bump said would fine. That's I'm saying. enough natural immunity even herd immunity. People incorrectly assumed would based faulty seroprevalence studies since basically discredited. Without vaccines, doubt Texas would seeing similar surge. Texas almost 20% population fully vaccinated though. Brazil probably around 40% infected, means needs another 20% really chance reaching herd immunity. understand. say need forever change lives covid...so obviously he's right wing, duh /s Exactly. 

My friend kidney transplant wore masks transplant, matter course. cousin aftermarket liver? Ditto. Nephew heart transplant? ""I shank next asshole tries preach 'faith fear' me. could wear mask heart destroyed viral infection, wear one buy groceries.""

But give right spread springtime allergy snot across public spaces.

(I'm vaccinated now, high-risk category, might wear mask public rest life. Cuts waaaaay number people recognize want conversations I'm trying buy bread milk.) anti-VAXxers getting hostile learn vastly outnumbered oooe want jab? Bible doctor taking over-the-counter medicine, ibuprofen, acetaminophen, aspirin, antihistamines, pain discomfort may experience getting vaccinated. take medications relieve post-vaccination side effects medical reasons prevent taking medications recommended take medicines vaccination purpose trying prevent side Wonder means starting cruises since many crew come developing countries vaccines readily available US already necessary aspects life, clearly supported original comment, need place enter store?

The crowd opposes needing ID voting clear discriminatory potential requiring people present documents spot supports give every random movie theater owner medical information walk inside?

I'm vaccinated. I'll tell employer let store along confidential medical information. Everyone eligible less month. get vaccine protect themselves. need introduce new mechanism clear potential abuse minimal (if any) upside? Yeah son born month COVID hit US gone 3 places parents doctors. sucks can‚Äôt take anywhere morons won‚Äôt get vaccine don‚Äôt believe science. think allow folks service industries, likely younger, catch get shots vaccines opening everyone.. unsafe fully vaccinated full blown travel mind end causing surges workers industries. Get people vaccinated question anymore. 


I live casino tourist town. We're trying get working folk vaccinated fast can. could use HCQ avoid shit show altogether. state could always choose protect people walk around barefoot shirtless, and, state so, businesses wouldn‚Äôt able bar service people would full protection state law. manner, state could choose pass law makes unvaccinated people protected class. country cant medical secret. Even nurses decline vaccin not? Thank conversion see much moving goalposts new issues continuing pop needed solutions. Really still steps 2 3 vaccine start lower numbers. None goals outcome ""complete everything goes back normal"".

Ultimately think goal deaths cases, end day that's really boils to. feel like MN decent job communicating ""dials"" cases deaths went restrictions vice versa. Though get yo-yoing restrictions also frustrate people rather sticking it. could use HCQ deal antiquated website hurts eyes, homie. don‚Äôt. Hey genius, age private part damn medical records! ROCKET SCIENCE! don‚Äôt know category 5 even helps. means evacuate? Gee, wonder why. 8 year old one unvaccinated Easter gathering today. 

(Which held outside 1. still safe eat inside maskless since us month shot #1 2. gorgeous day, thankfully.) Fauchi wrong since day 1 unfortunately overly optimistic. hope since found pregnant child older, would know would always answer call regardless time day. I'm glad close relationship mom.   Glad good experience! Sounds like dentist things right way! Great counter-argument. Love proof. moron, get shot give card literally designed show people vaccinated. 

some people literally know stfu, even utterly wrong proven so. me? write this? Ugh, feel you. Teachers retiring COVID, teachers retiring public suddenly interested education past 25 years could give two shits it. complete utter dishonesty. think HCQ much easier actually, problems booking appointments, HCQ always on-hand. Dropping mandate probably net zero effect, already wearing masks keep wearing them, weren‚Äôt never before. 14 mlns end april? Yuck, we‚Äôre 11 aa right now... 3 mlns month doesn‚Äôt sound much reassuring target office uses sporicidal disinfectant glasses patients. You‚Äôre always welcome bring eyewear too, you‚Äôre worried. I'm deeply introverted. I'm also prone anxiety. know rises level disorder, hate it. exhausting around people be, think interacting people real life helps feel less anxious. alone means obsessive thoughts keep company. 

So I'm looking forward everything going back normal, know benefit return normalcy. see, yeah believe get feeling. like said, think opinions changing fairly quickly weather getting nice, people getting vaccinated, hospitalizations/deaths declining. least Spring weather able outside, even restrictions place couple months yet. think read end May early June everybody wants vaccine US able get one well (my state already anybody 18+ wants schedule appt), basically moving exponentially right direction, think summer everything basically back normal besides maybe pockets smaller outbreaks.

I think Fauci CDC want people overly careful little yet get deaths even dropping restrictions. going hell party haha! Um, aren‚Äôt borders closed? Unvaccinated people legal protections one passed law giving protections. nothing right stopping state adding protected class. would change federal government passed law mandating COVID vaccines vaccine passport, since state law overrule federal law. Lol yes nice go out. doot doot do! Mask mandates never proven marginal effect. Lol India really well considering massive population poverty tho. 1 Lakh 100,000 thought so, bit worried last time went dentist. provided ""sunglasses"" looks like tight fitting safety goggles wear dental cleaning. AFAIK, catch COVID via eyes. I'm wondering disinfecting sunglasses patients safe disinfectant used cleaning glasses? touch eye lashes time time bit concerned. that, I'd say I'm feeling pretty comfortable visiting dentist COVID. Yeah, don‚Äôt hang internet psychos. Better luck next time. Omg, what? vaccine doesn‚Äôt make bulletproof incapable getting sick spreading.... surprising! /s usually chosen students working need flexibility though. still little bit stigma. Ok show us law says can‚Äôt this. CDC guidelines that...guidelines. take leave them. I'm fully immunized. Today went store Coke. Coke. week's shopping, rushing store minding distances. medication. one Coke. Definitely different. whole point can't voluntarily isolate 100% safe people reckless ones get virus. people reckless likely it'll slip past random guy's isolation infect even though everything avoid it. guys like act like personal responsibility situation, really opposite - lot time irresponsible people basically consequences, ones suffer results actions involved all.

They ask observe restrictions protect bunch old people, people observe society gets screwed, takes small number disproportionately ruin everyone else. vaccination medical status, numbnuts. many times people spell you, dingus? absolutely within business' right ask whatever damn well please entering establishment.

you're welcome pass stance completley daft bereft logic, reasoning sound mindedness. Category 5, Ef-5, 7.9 magnitude, 9th inning, 5 yard line, it‚Äôs final countdown...do doooo Aw, guess dont want grab pint. Oh well, loss. could compared lies homeless real stories same, proof. would even paid booze. CDC recommends eating medium-rare steak.

Feel free begin living life *now*, regardless overly cautious recommendations. talking though computer screen. TLDR. Anal swabs, hope. article 3 weeks old, go: Agreed, it'll fall kids get it. Maybe open 2022?

Hopefully enough adults get kill thing enough need wait till then..... Nope! Easy tell sentiment sub Okay, yes protects unvaccinated degree, still nearly safe someone vaccinated. **Goes profile comments old posts** ‚Äúomg, youre obsessed‚Äù hilarious ""grown-up's"" like listen CDC stay inside weeks old man diapers says knows medical expert world despite medical background. sure you‚Äôre downvoted this! Sounds pretty reasonable hope people got placebo get shirt says something like ""I volunteered covid vaccine study got lousy t-shirt."" fine hospitals region overloaded. time tell people hold back hospitals fine, vaccinations US going pace matter fast things reopen there's almost never going hospital overload more. I‚Äôm fully vaccinated face shield stay. see what‚Äôs thing end day, thinking used face, can‚Äôt go back. Teacher unions opposition F2F science pretty much rigged favor government officials fully opening schools matter what. point, likely fine there's low community spread people getting vaccinated, prior point pretty much entire public flipped coin teachers acted like teachers suck up. 

You can't act surprised teacher unions going oppose F2F science actually ass backwards designed crafted way spread cannot deemed happen school. 37% pop given least one shot, NC 31% three year old showing signs depression. asked wanted Christmas, said ‚Äúfriends.‚Äù

But fuck wanting kid get education social interaction, right? best way raise kids keep locked house parents years time. I‚Äôll never forget commenter told selfish unable peace bc seeing friends distance outside last summer... hope person okay. Yeah right, like hundred million people North America. biggie. think get rid quarantine requirements international travel? Want go home visit fully vaccinated parents Ireland mine also! 1984 agreed upon Silicon Valley least decade ago.

Vaccine passports drop ocean digital totalitarianism.
When apps record state mind - soon physical parameters - 24/7 let data processing companies build employability insurability profiles every move, that's bit worrying. Well yeah, country 1.3 billion people seeing large rise cases. That‚Äôs big deal, keeps rising, lot people impacted. Yeah that‚Äôs higher would guessed. quarter mortality hospital load results something similarly H1N1 virus, say perfectly manageable

Also incorrect. Age also significant factor hospitalizations. 

Just another poorly constructed comment sub Reddit. would call what‚Äôs going ‚Äúsurge‚Äù Well cant vaccinate kids yet, do? protect unvaccinated

It large does. Vaccinated people incredibly unlikely catch spread COVID, studies coming every day confirming first time think year, Indiana reported COVID deaths 

I can't help think back 80s height AIDS. newspaper San Francisco published every week list names died. made announcement deaths week. end . Heaven knows AIDS still us start. I‚Äôm convinced list piece nothing dick measuring contest ivies days. money spend masks example? Donate amount research heart disease diabetes etc.

That point before. choice ""invest"" masks. easy. really understand mean? ""We seen before""? 

Seriously looked charts infection age. Children leading spikes now. teachers choice choice parents little resources skills find resources. mean get point wouldn‚Äôt call GVK mediocre lol ask me. agree continued restrictions make absolutely sense vaccines mandated. according article they're still going require masks social distancing anyway. That‚Äôs exactly feels! teacher? gonna incredibly difficult. I'm rooting you. found sugar free hard candy helped curb cravings first tried quit. quit I'm weak went vaping. 7 years cigarette free. it. Productivity measured dollars. companies spending less money per employee working remotely compared office seeing similar (to pre pandemic) profit return. end day, companies measure much spend per employee vs much profit employees produce company. Productivity profit. 73 year old mother zero side effects either dose. done homeschooling. Nice try though.

The teachers still work. Covid could disappear entirely tomorrow way people lived cautiously last 13 months would completely valid majority vaccinated mean COVID still issue. long COVID cases, restrictions. Vaccine ticket back old lives. Downvote want, hope wrong. We'll see we're get there. hope future anymore.

And happens cases start creeping next winter? Shut again? Nope, 14 flu-pneumonia still bigger risk. that's cherry-picking single high bad season: relatively low-risk big picture perspective. *Looks Michigan*

Yeah theres nooooo way thats going happen Rip lungs. spent much teenage years bongs blunts. smoked since covid started taking off. though? Yes country would sorry shape without ag workers. think percentage goes include 55+. people majority covid victims. say, enough vaccine, lets vaccinate whoever wants it. quickly want it. then, vulnerable first. Unlikely means unlikely... still 80-95% getting sick nearly 100% chance dying.

There countless viruses around country... flu, chicken pox, measles, etc. vaccine 100% effective them. Yet still leave houses go public places. We'll see, criminal liar. cannot *give* heart disease diabetes etc.

How complicated *this* sub? Lol. Love misinformation 

Israel allowing indoor dining number weeks now. Weddings allowed hundreds guests, night clubs also open weeks. stuff widely reported.

Please stay date information you‚Äôre gonna try contest killed least 151k people South Africa something It‚Äôs hilarious still hold opinion year later Well keep mind vaxed yet either. Parents that. Nobody stopping home school get flu shot every year virus mutate new forms fully protected antibodies previous versions. same. results vaccines showing thus far protected new strains. don‚Äôt know non-vaccine antibodies protect those.  Ohhh ok. what????? Discredit? Oh wouldn‚Äôt dream it. Merely pointing correlation. trying imply variant problem, might want look many people died second wave, caused variant, compared first wave. would vaccinated workers get sick? people allow mutations propagate

These mutant mo%$erfu%$ers mutinying maintain massive melee mutations milieu! Affecting* sorry. can‚Äôt help it. 

Also, yes. option stay virtual next year arguably job would way easier home; miss casual interactions humans going anywhere isn‚Äôt house, I‚Äôm going back. God dammit ""Mass scale"" 

Mass scale would mean LARGE portion student population, 10 kids 100 school. got weird definition mass scale surveillance testing is.  it, appointment 8th... I'll come back comment let know let shot disagree Khan here. Learning lectures reading. creating. teach full class lecture maybe every week. Every class involves creating something (writing, labs, presenting, drawing diagrams, research, etc.). That's real learning occurs. Per article stats , abnormal amount would percentage considered high? childhood cases increasing US well? 25% people receiving modern Pfizer vaccines died literally millions people would dead. Please engage critical thinking part brain. sarcastic? However.... would believe serious. factor increasing rate vaccinations?  It‚Äôs semantics. It‚Äôs literally counter example false claim. said one mass scale surveillance testing schools.. showed example did. need work logical reasoning. I‚Äôm sure. partner got sick traveling internationally January 2020, got sick got back. doctor said didn‚Äôt flu, viral. like flu hell me.

I like late February/early March things bad US. 

It‚Äôs possible, would one first thousand people US covid so, seems unlikely me? definitely possible.  school decided virtual literacy two days school started picked teachers randomized picked. little training platforms decent portion tech savvy. 

I‚Äôve got teacher still doesn‚Äôt know use half programs students use take photos email her. 

We 7 weeks left school still issue?

I like virtual school. part district okay job little time, money, effort put it. Since I‚Äôm good, might take ‚ÄúLate April‚Äù ‚ÄúEarly May‚Äù. wrong this, lot. would take predictions many pinches salt. concur. protocol heavily employed gin tonics extra lime. quinine vitamin C miracle concoction kept safe. district went hybrid rest year, absolutely right. Kids seemed fine zoom can't hold together classroom, vice versa! many days total person, gives us whole picture, helps us figure need, better prepared next year. rise cases alone bad.. long link hospitalizations/deaths breaks, we're fine... there's vaccines protecting younger also up, particularly among young adults. March 1 March 23, hospitalizations increased 633% adults ages 30 39 800% adults ages 40 49, according association. Varies based contracts. much compared vaccines.  Yes Michigan pretty much half rise think friends mom trial group polio also trial group Pfizer. She‚Äôs complete badass. Go it!! third-world countries? think need redefine herd immunity is. arbitrary percentage doesn‚Äôt makes sense. Probably population density people don‚Äôt type protection. 

I‚Äôd imagine public health scientists trying nail exact formula herd immunity, given pandemic excellent experiment. I'm goal post moving all.

Most kids school. surveillance testing vast majority students actually home? cannot use valid data justify opening schools. entirely missed point trying argue semantics point sole reason trying prove right internet, honestly suggests alot personality. S/b

What reading preprint this, think might got data. cannot remember called saw though. Ill try find post link little later.

I THINK number mathematical model using certain decay antibodies looking half life 10 years something? really understand it. thought Brazil made post burning pain chest body second dose. Relieved im one! thought crazy. really need put /s end? I've mine cleaned twice since start this. dentist taking extra precautions also. Reminds actually, need book another appointment lol. excess death curves South Africa consistent natural herd immunity established (they're nearly symmetrical).

I really hope happened, second wave (as shown killed twice many people first, would suggest immunity original variant useless B.1.351 variant came along. kids. high schooler best grades ever even close. went getting concerned emails calls teacher reaching us brag tell us amazing is. fortunate us. Got second dose Pfizer Friday afternoon. Friday evening Saturday afternoon, felt totally normal aside arm pain. Woke 5:30 Sunday morning BURNING, mean BURNING chest pain, nausea, burning over, really, worst chest. ended couch fetal position, hurt bad. actually scary. I've never heart issues I'm 24 yo female heart attack highly unlikely. Also, vaccination site arm hurting burning well matter position put in.

So, chest pain side effect vaccine, concerned something else going on??? know reddit place find doctors, I'm curious anyone similar reaction.

To clear, feel much better definitely would gotten vaccine regardless. people celebrating covid yet, everyone email writers editors feature Michael Osterholm email caps simply says ""FUCK FEAR MONGERING LUNATIC FEATURE CREDIBLE EXPERTS UNDERSTAND BALANCE SAFETY OPTIMISM""

I'm getting really tired bullshit claims, none even come close past year. really, likely get next 4-6 weeks latest went school south conservative area. people would probably say fans school (well, football). get meningitis hepatitis vaccines. assumed colleges this.  I‚Äôm selective numbers. Literally set numbers could choose, you‚Äôre wrong. made Kid stats always inaccurate since one mass scale surveillance testing schools least Western world knowledge.

I countered saying, no, New York City mass scale surveillance testing schools. argued weren‚Äôt school were. argued didn‚Äôt testing. wrong. you‚Äôre saying doesn‚Äôt count middle high schoolers weren‚Äôt kids virtual? GTFOH goal post moving. wrong.

And I‚Äôm missing point. said exact point one comments said it. Granted, part reason NYC successful strict protocols. Surveillance testing, mask mandates, automatic school shutdowns 10 days 2 untraceable cases, travel restrictions teachers staff. doubt schools probably spread result.


Also, zero 2. November surge NYC happen post Thanksgiving. Testing Nov 1-18 worthless, surge happened yet.

NYC schools person conducting surveillance testing January cases positivity rate higher point November January. Still low case counts surveillance testing despite high community spread city. That‚Äôs pretty serious claim. evidence back statement up? expect find antivaxxers r/Coronavirus places.. Hi aapmonqoMo I‚Äôm. like qql say was.

I know, conversation Fauci's recommendations. Influenza twice deadly covid 18, covid 10x deadly 18. Weird human body works. Especially consider giving 4 million doses day, probably increase 5 million week so. That‚Äôs another 100 million doses next 20-25 days Right, bar filtered limit to, yes? No, need worry it. 1km way way beyond practically possible. Outside even meter two dramatically reduces risk.  wish depression worked like that. certainly impossible turn things around, extremely difficult. great, September üòì
I'm hoping America ends large excess vaccines coming way sooner be. Florida. Governor signed order banning businesses require vaccine passports. Sounds like great opportunity bars across street. Businesses, especially bars enact measures going find hard way people spend money elsewhere. Probably rapid tests widely unavailable. side effects second dose Pfizer didn‚Äôt care all. What‚Äôs hours body aches low fever compared covid? Totally worth it. First make show ID buy drinks, want prove make workers sick, ridiculous! variant what? Literally one companies producing COVID-19 vaccine pay $100M settlement selling baby powder caised cancer. guess say thar science figured eventually, lot us okay maintaining safety protocols waiting additional research longer allowed mask less parties fully vaccinated. pace first week May idea you‚Äôre downvoted. You‚Äôre spot on. data seems clearly show we‚Äôre heading 4th wave. Everyone pretending it‚Äôs over. don‚Äôt get it. I've lot success making new things previously. 

For example, got group dads kids' school together twice month big parking lot cooler beer. Everybody knows drill hangs apart, eventually got bored started putting together projects school like rebuilding planters kindergarten yard.

I think 3-4 examples like this, stuff that's taken place things used do. made whole thing *so much easier*. B117 already dominant Europe vaccines seem work well. Literally one companies producing COVID-19 vaccine pay $100M settlement selling baby powder caised cancer. guess say thar science figured eventually, lot us okay maintaining safety protocols waiting additional research longer true uphill battle getting people believe this. many seem stuck believing first ""data"" heard validates opinions. death rate low live fear, kids get covid-19, masks work, .... Several, yes. 

And taken kids infants say 2 years old quarantine everyone immediate family year even 2 sure would grown well adjusted adults now.

It‚Äôs big ask. cannot wear mask whatever reason, old, young, medical condition, plain stupid stay fuck home.

It‚Äôs sucks. It‚Äôs president Ed. bad. Stay home. oooh, sounds promising :D thank you! Say goodbye 10% tenured professors.  thanks! Good. kid likely die car accident soccer practice covid. S/b since beginning pandemic hear you. hate current job want find new one, I'm already mentally exhausted can't fathom learn new job took words right mouth! getting bad man first trying stay strong personal problems started piling adding stress see everyone else getting stressed out. see people give f\*\*\* spreading without care even though get GPA drop even debt go upppp able work. even fear death feel bad immunocomp go work scraps deal inconsiderate beings. saying doesn't. I'm really sorry still suffering morbidity. Thrombosis cause certain tissues parts organs die - permanently there's nothing done. 

The long-covids benefit vaccine dose seem tissues affected yet experienced necrosis rather chronic inflammation. estimate 50-70% long-covids improve. However, that's say getting vaccinated still prevent thrombosis damage otherwise end getting 2nd, 3rd 4th time.  People big fan facts site. bet small ‚Äúwave‚Äù northern states peak 7-14 days. like last year. Covid seasonal like corona viruses. March-April areas 40*N experience higher prevalence. Cold Weather equal seasonality. Plus waves much smaller now, people without antibodies/protection shrinking drastically day. guess reasonable, lot early on, many immune (same situation california winter) couple cases spread exponentially. victim success suppose care all, long everyone wants vaccine gotten one. point muh go Spring Break crowd gonna seed many infections next wave. Older people won‚Äôt die younger people allows virus spread mutate Well course passports expire, talking entire passport program expiring. I'm skeptical that. next year? 

And next?

And next?

Covid going away, likely become seasonal. vaccines last forever, going require song dance every Covid season? got twice year apart. Positive tests everything. get brain lung damage covid first, almost non existent kids. much likely die car accident way school. False. long term effects lotta people even it‚Äôs rarely deadly. back February mild still can‚Äôt smell let tell sucks. Like it‚Äôs loss something fundamental took granted.
Also it‚Äôs protection everyone students interact with.  would make jealous? That's anything works. Laws get struck they're involving constitutionally protected group. feel bad y‚Äôall don‚Äôt in-person learning. can‚Äôt even imagine. hope happens soon ‚ù§Ô∏è One persons fearmongering another person voicing legitimate cause concern, know really difficult peoples actions decisions could impact personally find hugely beneficial take breath remember probably think best. usually dependent whether let alcohol skin fully dry. Anytime I've received shot disinfect immediately inject, stings. Give 30s dry there's nothing. tests aren‚Äôt perfect, testing negative doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre infected


Also, could cold, flu, allergy. knows. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know even need schools. information available books.‚Äù one CNN talking carrot stick approach states removing mask mandates opening 100% keep people line get vaccine numbers states declining. he's not, understand fundamental difference. Future leaders? Calm mama. Okay claim surge would next six weeks.

Michigan surge **now**. certainly deciding people! People need personal risk-benefit analysis.

There certainly long term effect body people severe cases covid. However, I've seen, younger people get severe cases. comes case case basis. People need talk doctor see what's right them. 
If they're risk group covid, probably take it. they're risk covid, I'd wait. Personally, doctor indifferent, take leave it. now, I'm leaving it. It‚Äôs foreign interest. disagree entirely true. Got first shot Saturday, second scheduled July. Nothing conclusive come yet. things reopening younger people ones vaccinated yet. way, it‚Äôs showing vaccine works real world, vaccinated ending hospitals. retirees, older people spared. Exactly this, new change watch happen overseas year later still like nah happen here. 

And concern specifically mentioned end post comes kids. funding residual damage, permanent? knows...to people kids. Even sometimes especially mild symptoms. Kids even sniffles persistent lung damage. setting entire generation children long term health issues appears effect much? much unknown little known kids immediately emergent. don‚Äôt kids. you? Murphy even say things. said order drop mask mandate need wear masks now. So...it caused government incompetence saying, right?

If even remotely prepared even masks necessary. Government healthcare entities caught wholly unprepared never bothered prepare first place. 

This virus might novel, like redefining definition viruses anything. Airborne viruses new, find odd handling changed suddenly one. 

Perhaps really *is* different somehow *just* found masks work prevent spread airborne illness degree, would've irrelevant charge even remotely competent. 

Should've, would've, could've, suppose. Canucks hockey team. ""experts"" never wanted admit wrong this. quietly mentioned need wipe groceries quickly moved on. paying close attention, would easy miss Hope get back school soon ‚ù§Ô∏è picture phone accepted reasons listed exist states right now, seemed determined prove decrease cases mask related. that‚Äôs case, wearing them.

Doesn‚Äôt seem thats sentiment second comment though. good, frustrated media narratives. US never going avoid pandemic, affected virtually every country except isolated island nations. agree things could handled better, let‚Äôs pretend ‚Äúshutting down‚Äù borders 15 months remotely feasible. India new double mutation variant affecting younger people more. confers immunity escape previous infection antibodies well greater transmissibility.

Yes, according that‚Äôs really heard Cornell said won‚Äôt that.

Cornell said depends situation like semester approaches. think they're currently planning restrictions, also plan removing restrictions herd immunity reached then. problem far there's clear indication exactly meant herd immunity. general consensus seems 70% population vaccinated, I've also seen people say 85 90%. guess we'll wait see. need video this. mean, go Big 5 HEXACO extraversion trait arises.  agree, binary silly, spectrum people less introverted extroverted, vary situation, environment, etc. might premature claim US vaccination rate hitting refused.

I mean, glad got taken care still fair left go. didn‚Äôt get arrested simply refusing temp check. asked leave Disney Springs, part 4 parks. literally could complied, apologized, stayed Disney World. weird hill die on. He‚Äôs also quite dirty businessman, took health employees paycheck didn‚Äôt actually give healthcare. one owes 500k medical bill. Also owes almost 900k state police refuses pay. believe science, don‚Äôt also believe science behind extra testing normally required vaccine get approved?

I got shots already, science says isn‚Äôt safe timeline manufacture distribute drug like this. science also says says sons risks involving corona virus. 

This one isn‚Äôt simple ‚Äúbelieve science‚Äù Yep, that‚Äôs me. Somehow. BMI 25.8. Guess I‚Äôll look vaccines dad People really pretending kids don‚Äôt pick spread germs. go pharmacy recently kids maskless running free. One set parents (masked) brought five kids (not masked) store three ground screaming temper tantrums whole time (while parents walked around store nonchalantly). say that? Makes sense vaccine working now, guess you‚Äôre thinking pandemic never end! A. feel better.

B. Nobody knows. problem may disagree matter policy, objectively wrong saying business right ask private medical information. certainly do. assure students enjoying plenty normal human interactions masks. aren‚Äôt silence lambs style locks. also plenty unmasked time family. It‚Äôs ridiculous suggest 5th graders harmed fabric mask worn big group distancing isn‚Äôt possible. talking babies never saw anyone including family members without mask, would point. Ugh They're also operating loss would likely vaccine choice impoverished countries. yes fucked unlike companies good humanity good humanity fair bit profit too. deserve stick incompetencies also deserve praise receive minimal. shut international borders February 2020, yes could avoided pandemic. Nice Shame took long remove this. Lotta people saw posts right, go narrative too. motha fuckas gonna milk Yeah, take actually start need it, get headache fever shot, preemptively shot. Yes consistent data far. virus changed adapt children serious problem. Likely effect would decades pandemic instead 1-2 years. good news schools could make vaccine requirement attend, past emergency use authorization. 

But yes data i've seen kids get it, typically adults bring homes, spread kids. LIkewise schools typically adults bring schools, masking, little spread among kids. flip-flop pubs. First yes, no, maybe depending waves.

You can't trust word. trust authoritarian tendencies, full display entire year [Dallas coach pulled 3rd (I Canes fan watching reportedly fully vaccinated. countries u.s. americans aversion id cards similar things Unexplained chest pain always reason see doctor. probably nothing serious, something like panic attack bad acid reflux cause pretty scary chest pains want rule heart issues physician able that. nuance include difference trials challenges variants though, which, see thread every day, lacking.

And logic, private business require employees wear suit tie work either. employees discretion want wear, yes? glad following strategy also, better give people first dose first. USA followed strategy probably would close done covid now. better one kids teenager could watch damn kids home no, bring whole fucking squad. woke feeling great, hour later hit hard. feels flu chills, sore muscles, fever.

That‚Äôs point, get mask protection another couple months case rates down. Unfortunately, observation spot on. Thank this. Keep up! need people like you. Living Florida hard answer question things talking already happening entire time. Everyone school, people know work full time person one pods bubbles kind please. People wear masks stores see us wearing masks store past June. think main difference summer things like large weddings socially acceptable. 

Re: AZ vaccine. effective SA variant AFAIK widely circulating North America moment. actually like mask public outings. feel like helps getting sick. Usually end sinus infection, bronchitis pneumonia 1-2 times year. past year. since pandemic started try sleep better, wash sanitize hands groceries, nephew niece schooling home didn‚Äôt get sick either. weirdest thing me, seeing parents wearing masks (either properly nose), kids whatever age not. Like also let kids wear seatbelts something, idk hit nail head. subreddit full people think road are. getting closer, aren‚Äôt yet. Hopefully it‚Äôll stop seems guaranteed. lessons rest world falling deaf ears here. true. plateaus come rise seeing rise.

Of course, plateaus worrying enough sign we‚Äôre worked, stopped progress.

We level last June. cases rising over. course, give youngsters depression give therapy later! I'm guessing kids. There‚Äôs numerous articles sub quotes doctors state officials implying/saying vaccine is/is likely cause deaths.

This isn‚Äôt normal blood clot issues, it‚Äôs incredibly rare disorder blood clots low platelets time -severe enough lead death. 

Sweeping problems rug make people distrust vaccine. admit it‚Äôs perfect, particularly AZ, still solid argument rewards outweigh risk. never said Antivax.

Want try understand someone else would be? Nope. 

Just yell alternate opinion rules. I‚Äôm vaccinated, bare minimum required law public. Masks going garbage day mandate ends.

Hoping I‚Äôll still able work home. Cats bag done, regardless pandemic. Moderna area none family felt all. several family members live elsewhere we've said same.  bled tad know something happened arm super sore times too. Oh wow, didn‚Äôt know that. saw states made high priority vaccination assumed. Thanks info. lot people subreddit desperately want Covid lost plot. 

I want over, too. know point hasn‚Äôt come yet. pretend has, longer take get there. Plz update convos :) There‚Äôs conclusive proof presence new variant India far know. I'm glad Canada following UK strategy. takes time ramp production vaccine alot back end loaded. another variant rear ugly head months down. go. Antivax bullshit like rules. you‚Äôre vaccinated matter? whole world. According Bloomberg data there‚Äôs Special Olympics people conditions could put higher risk Benefits outweigh risks 7 people.

That's politicians seem understand.

Yes, everyone taking vaccine order us return 2019 Normal best interest country job. MAY outweigh individual taking vaccine.

If reason catch covid, could die. work as, take vaccine, could die. 

Mostly purposely injecting something. 

With covid, catch first, might die it. 

What covid know, took vaccine killed you. took unnecessary risk died greater good?

So, gone taken vaccine, survived vaccine. take mask? stop socially distancing? No? take risk? rig exhaust filter

Or could simply remove inhale valves seal exhale valve shut, voila... inhale exhale filtered.

This exactly MSA [Advantage think around ~13M Sinovac ~1.5M Pfizer far (arrivals, given doses). everyone keeps talking end pandemic coming everyone vaccinated. I‚Äôm Canada, it‚Äôll probably end summer see this. 

But like? Like exactly like pandemic? Everyone back school? ppl back office? masks anywhere? masks, situations would need wear them?

Can hang many people want? need create ‚Äúbubbles‚Äù see one household family? safe enough? 

Do vaccines work VOC‚Äôs? parents got AstraZeneca worry stands South African variant.   Well, look way- many young people died Covid? Nearly 2000 US 18-29yo age group. many people died covid vaccine? Probably none tens hundreds millions doses.

Long covid thing- harm covid vaccine happens right dose lasts months thing found? No.

So would assume there's good chance problem longer vaccine even higher chance problem long infected? logical. It‚Äôs extreme sounds like something person normally regular keep healthy. Putting health appointments general bad idea. Ounce prevention, pound cure that. Same. daughter jumped multiple grade levels reading. went never wanting read trying trick us thinking went bed could stay finish Harry Potter series 1AM. variants spread easily said would submitting ""within matter weeks"" happened yet. agree premise adults need done first. town outbreak high school resulted several older people landing hospital caught kids started sleepover ""back school"" party finally went back in-person. lasted 3 weeks outbreak closed schools again, prematurely ended winter sports seasons, closed restaurants, many things. small town, spread like fire schools community.  know MN driven B117 variant. infectious deadly original strain. race vaccinate here. 


At least medical staff taken surge virus. mental strain still though. virus changed since then? good news, finally catching breaking rules even catching politicians. [Does ease worked South African public health system. literally worst (or second worst) TB crisis Earth. two-fold, I'm denying Covid led increase deaths. quite clear did. personal level, lost close friend Covid, diwd along mother father. national level:
- conditions needed cause Covid spike conditions needed cause TB spike same. 
- Even best times, 77% TB cases SA successfully treated. 
- number even worse Multi drug resistant TB. 

Are spike likely caused Covid? Yes. However, pandemic (TB) allocate half resources pandemic stop another global health crisis, going excess deaths either way. That's diminishing minimizing impact Covid, saying excess deaths South Africa, existing respiratory infection pandemic can't taken ""1 extra death = 1 untracked Covid death"". put another way, imagine Covid exist, government essentially cut TB services half, would expect jump excess deaths? experts? True, although that‚Äôs likely social aspect less education. Quit pretending like type actually prefers home anyway. want things closed show face society, get it, going wreck society. Man hope that‚Äôs really true. lot riding damn vaccines!!! Bullshit Yes 100% effective kids wow! Saw lot gatherings today. rise occur Michigan Northeast? Fauci co enjoying limelight hard let go optimistic even faced facts. Daminit, knew children trying kill us all. Deadly little f\*ckers. thanks! that‚Äôs helpful right! There's easy solutions get vaccinated.  Colleges flip-flop much COVID guidelines put much thought it. places start getting rid mask mandates universities probably will. going go like this: 

2-3 days pass one actually check pain ass. Half people lose bar first 30 minutes. Actually kind do. day age, we've seen many kids grown less isolated homeschool online programs. end stupid, end brilliant, end weird, end normal. We've seen kids turn often pretty dependent specific program, kid, home environment. Whereas long term COVID effects, know much anything. ‚ÄúWe‚Äù who? Tampa Bay Area, Orlando, Miami-Dade Metro, Jacksonville - areas make half Florida‚Äôs population together guidelines line rest country. yes - didn‚Äôt matter much rural areas lower population density didn‚Äôt give shot followed Governor. Florida isn‚Äôt swamp outside major cities, rural. It‚Äôs really hard understand. doesn‚Äôt mean don‚Äôt need protect thinking restaurants/grocery stores/etc. there‚Äôs really choice employees want get paid. mean there‚Äôs easy solution :( pfizer, moderna, J&amp;J produce spike protein end. works one work California... hope eventually something like US. $25 VISA card every shot. would close vaccine gaps real quick. private businesses can't please country. I'm sure got from. I'm saying couple gets pregnant says ""ok one us stay home"", hard arrange. full-time jobs *can* support small family. Obviously that's cases single parents because, well, duh. problem arises parents already working suddenly one stay home. think that's ""indictment"" economic system. full-force? even see people full-force measures first two months. ""just deal it"" attitude definitely contributed lot anti-mask sentiment, think high ground here. sure coming from, university student tell distanced masked learning pretty rough. Zoom learning well. things now, herd immunity reason so, would extremely foolish educational detriment every student universities paying way much this. Covid transmits air, HIV not. comparison absurd. Holy shit, that‚Äôs crazy. we‚Äôre even close 1 million doses applied. I'd also recommend tetanus shot. ways effectively fight covid are:

-wear masks limit aerosols

-ventilate indoor spaces dilute aerosols

-avoid close contact

-limit crowds

-get shot

everything else theater effective. data sunlight help indoors. sooooo yeah. ""deep cleaning"" plexiglass pretty much fuckall way people describing measures like great travesty. They're keep people alive health. mild inconvenience probably gone Xmas. deal it. lebron said famously, 1, 2, 3, 4. Wake 5th wave. favor Covid transfered animals first place whatever, keep wearing mask maybe dick incredibly rude start traveling STILL locking up

You act elderly person literally preventing traveling... that‚Äôs case slightest Fuck man. thing already killing us left right, there's new strain??? teachers community die COVID, made impact. Lol didn‚Äôt happen would happen now? spreads students parents en masse suffering far worse simply missing school year... really difficult one parent stay home. 

That's pretty privileged thing say. kids 1 parent? parents low income earners can't afford one parent work? 

You'd surprised incredibly common scenarios are. parties agree though. Republicans Democrats disagree you. believe idea %tested get meaningful sample size; schools 2k kids/staff need test many say school 200. random percentage, sorry clear. I'm sorry infected. I‚Äôm getting mine Monday question, vaccine stops virus, wearing mask slow spread?

YMMV, programs difficult, impossible without in-person education. Engineering, nursing, hard sciences - list significant. Pfizer laughs Countrys can't keep shit control travel trade blocked get shit together.

So...The entirety Europe North South Americas? suspect double mutant thing esecape mutations e484q L452R articles explaining unfortunatly. Same. entire dosing section card entirely covered 2 separate stickers place got mine done. boosters, I'll new card issued 100%. businesses good reason require vaccine passport. 

Passport? I'm sure attended college US, vaccination records required always been. World's worst guy

World's worst? Really? governor Florida? Ranking generally considered ""the world's worst"" like Bashar al-Assad, Jair Bolsanaro, Rodrigo Duterte, Xi Jiping, Kim Jong-un? That's argument gonna go with? got 2nd Pfizer dose today :D ...where say anything minimizing death toll COVID?

 simply saying respiratory viruses cause many long-term effects people erroneously think ""novel"" COVID.

COVID cause due higher severity fact many people caught COVID catch flu typical seasonal influenza season, mechanisms action going similar respiratory illnesses, coronaviruses various influenza strains. HIV Ebola. shit. either. hell is? Mine getting vaccine soon find it. Sure, talking variant discovered dec/jan right? 90% deaths work morning didn‚Äôt really need reminder. Thanks anyway. There‚Äôs lot that. Fucking biochemists.

If antibodies bind new variant full ten-fold worse, sounds scary probably isn‚Äôt problem. ever voted state didnt ridiculous restrictions? thats exactly do. say name, live, vote. believe not, people caught corona voting 2020 people committed fraud year That‚Äôs cool thought whole problem kids bring home families, 100% get infected whatever have, turn take work, grocery store, wherever go. Seems like one fastest ways could increase spread lol. complicated that. example, CA, technically eligible yet due age group. registered state vaccine site HMO. whim last weekend, logged HMO site saw link vaccine appointments signed up, got shot Tuesday morning.

If people sitting around waiting contacted obeying advertised tiers, throws everything demand appear lower. site got vaccine busy lines, couple dozen stations.

It's complicated scenario read demand falling off. Cuomo? Totally agree foolish. entire risk population vaccinated entire adult population taken care soon. 2022? I'm nursing homes across region. laminating mine suspect boosters needed variants running around. recommend ibuprofen anything help symptoms? like him. amazing Joe Rogan early pandemic got Republican dad take virus seriously‚Äî even couldn‚Äôt. 

With said, recently quite bit regarding variant. Could right time? Maybe. think Leonard Cohen sang us years ago:

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs coming America first/Cradle best worst/It‚Äôs they‚Äôve got range, machinery change/And it‚Äôs they‚Äôve got spiritual thirst.‚Äù rollout, supply. come philly PA supply per capita states? (Looking Michigan 6x increase cases 1.5 months here.) say tried trick lie me, understand situation changed rapidly, lot chaos spurred everyday people let fear virus control every thought. think that's going away time soon. needs happen everybody get vaccine we‚Äôre good.

We'll see. 

I can't tell many times I've heard people say ""trust scientists,"" call far stricter restrictions even said scientists they've allowed media terrify them. Getting doses states per capita. west coastal states barely school. lowest rates country pacific northwest schools closed recently. Many districts refuse open school year. lot respect teachers know they're working hard. least here, lot kids behind. Especially urban schools parents strong voice. son fine, also homeschooled different curriculum taught read. way ahead rest kids class came back. They're masked he's class 7 kids. They're beyond cautious here. cases ebb flow. We've surges like everyone else. sure seems like hell lot better COVID. freaking love Canadian accent!!! smoke weed getting vaccine? got vaccine friday know painkillers interfere vaccine working. may dumb question want make sure would say get back work teacher so.. 1. Philly gets vaccines directly federal government.

2. rest PA, although rough start, one fastest rollouts whole country. data doesn‚Äôt seem jive conclusions. Unless think 20-29 year olds children. It‚Äôs teachers knowing utilize breakout rooms. It‚Äôs teacher‚Äôs ability hold child‚Äôs attention better standing next them. It‚Äôs child student better able read body language facial expressions person.

And simply comparison comes play socialization. It‚Äôs even planet. know, I'm voicing opinion, that's literally said.  confirm. wife felt we‚Äôve got first shot waiting next one. That's incubus means. think mean incubator. mask mandate struck like week ago, HIGHLY unlikely explanation. definitely epicenter pandemic month fall/winter, people antibodies, pretty consistently #1 country administering doses received. Thank posting this, nice knowing someone else feels same.

Had really rough year. Well said. opportunity change times get stuck past. definitely new normal folks fighting new normal able adjust. 2021. new world there. somehow Biden gets credit?  anyone link like plastic sleeve thing put card in? Instead laminating it. real problem kids keep hands washed masks on, thousands kids intermingling ages, whether sharing game consol, sharing food, cigs you, older ones still carry it, likely start finding Brazil SA variants midst let wild. Americans absolutely terrible understanding exponents.

The real danger comes communal enclaves refuse vaccine (or think INS honeypot) ... virus place mutate comes back general society.

As society America can't beat this, foreign government watching weakness societal architype COVID, would short order think gives American individualism's ""we number one"" whole new meaning. assuming authorities wanted less people get first place..... ... sounds like simple fever me. stay hydrated, get plenty rest &amp; take Tylenol needed  O:-) absolutely both. No, fits personal narrative, roll it. Ah yes, music theory, like call it, ""[the musical style 18th century see campaign?

Can y'all quit basic science denial shit? extras state trouble getting people take it. much bad information there. people really think vaccines bad help eradicate worse diseases history. wish grandparents could talk terrible diseases life changes vaccines. Getting vaccine soon don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll eating indoors... still pass virus unvaccinated waitstaff customers isn‚Äôt bad others unvaccinated ? DeSantis went CDC focused seniors. states started follow suit even CDC changed guidance.
This Publix thing laughable explained length press conference. shocked 60 Minutes even ran piece. embarrassing. wouldn‚Äôt vaccine distributed massive supermarket chain? deliberately contains zero per capita numbers, making extremely misleading. feel like lot people beginning saying want front line wanted see went taking turn. Yes, there's evidence long term illness kids we've shit year. 

A year.

Once again, 3/4 way year point, wait next year starts? talked signing up. She‚Äôs 100% board. She‚Äôs bit nervous blood draws going do, it‚Äôs something wants do. say private businesses allowed things, said private businesses allowed whatever want. people government decide businesses can't ask vaccination status customers, can't that. He's murderer.   mention immunity escape, antibodies less effective. already see Soutth African variant - mean vaccines wont work. Thank you! run decent sized SRE team stay lockstep dev. isn‚Äôt mentioned article new variants appear much highly contagious children. 
 Get f‚Äôd. Him: Let‚Äôs talk new hospitalization death numbers. continue go down, objective, measurable numbers look at.

You: DON‚ÄôT NEED NUMBERS FACTS. FACTS PEOPLE FEELINGS. SCARED, BETTER ACTUAL NUMBERS.  I‚Äôm guessing don‚Äôt work education understand reality system.  Well shit. 

Yes death sickness awful, deal anyone roads barren. Omg, fucking bliss. Thank mama high risk 4 year old! Let daughter know helping many kids like son. Cheese curds known antidote. ... nah kid teens got sick time. lots issues model schooling. Kids locked away home staring laptops better alternative. Nope, false hope. Soon there's gonna ""variant evades vaccine"" excuse everyone feel bamboozled. I'm gonna wait hilarious moment think way legitimate debate taking health danger seriously.

The problem people disagree negative dffect shutdowns society; problem many people reductive attitude comes pandemic.

The people arguing shutdowns end academic, social emotional challenges children face acknowledging pursuing solution alternatives. always comes ending shutdown measures rarely, ever, acknowledgment real danger poses children, families collective communities.

If we're worried children struggling academically, let's talk education system's inability function properly digital age. Let's talk rampant digital illiteracy children *and* adults. We're richest country world height modern technology, yet schools struggle handle online schooling. Social media plugged fabric society, yet can't organize healthy social opportunities kids. top that, mental health always low priority society hurting kids generations. pandemic highlighting problems weaknesses already continue there... Unless something it.

So really care problems, address directly. Let's get loud stuff. downplaying ignoring dangers pandemic fix problems practically assures deadly consequences. Shots arms everywhere!  far covid neither significant risk.  Giving vaccine risk seems unethical me. opinion. guess I'm late finding guy. definitely check podcast AMA. Thanks letting know! Every time see article variants says vaccine fine it. worried second. long protein shape similar enough seems like Mr. cells pity fool. Wide reaching health scares like pandemic cause people develop anxieties around things like viruses contamination before. I'm saying that's dad could suffering from, know course, relative issues like past trauma. continues anxiety coronavirus, counselling might help. Honestly, surprised past year triggered lot almost PTSD like conditions people, shame. China real natural immunity cities clamped relatively early vaccination program tiny, actually pretty big problem. grandma getting second dose Moderna tomorrow. don‚Äôt read. listen podcast. bullshit. fact.  Vincent Racaniello AMA subreddit April 8th 1pm.

He Week Virology (TWiV ) podcasts others post times every week. county everyone bitching non stop caring wave overdoses suicides coming. 

The preliminary coroner‚Äôs report:
2019- 2900 deaths (previous record)
2020- 3600 deaths (new record)
(Suicides 2 = statistically insignificant)
(Drug overdoses 11 = number 2016)
Covid deaths = neighborhood 550 almost like big pharma allowed write headlines increase profits. roll. Look WWII. First ignore problem say it‚Äôs something happening somewhere else. engage hits shores, unprepared arsenal depleted previous decades. Next proceed make series deadly blunders enough victories keep everything completely unraveling. then, US actually come effective response. exactly government needs mandate businesses. Otherwise antivaxxers ruin everyone bring us right back square one. Capitalism proves tools deal pandemic people selfish zero empathy. Ok, really difficult write. 
One children one flag. eleven. gained weight far less motivated anything virtual. like pulling teeth get anything requires next every second it. slipped far peers math science, though least performs much higher average english social studies. 

I ache get back classroom.

However, condition makes extremely risky contract covid. finally got first vaccine days ago (I could gotten earlier, supply low county kept running out!), although two-day week plan in-person schooling starts tomorrow, get second vaccine three weeks. 

So ask hard questions. Yes, would absolutely red flag her, think would absolutely better general return school. hand, socializing skills actually GREATLY improved, we've already modified diet upping physical activity day, extremely close. case, reading read...is worth risk life mother instead holding little longer I'm fully vaccinated?

I'm choosing wait send back. wanted share experience I'm reading many comments either black white, personally think predominant shade gray af. clear cut. Imagine reading article reacting like major concern 5-10 years bunch cases something awful came infected covid.  Like shingles coming chickenpox... definitely don‚Äôt kids  Well dad fully vaccinated yet still acting like worst yet come. went last night friend outdoor bar fine. Correct. AZ vaccine contain aluminum salts adjuvant. would perfectly fine used. it‚Äôs physically possible get metal particle counts absolute zero. necessary. tiny amount detectable meaningless terms lifetime health outcomes. able tell grandkids mom experimented new vaccines technology her! many relatives never expected get vaccinated got first doses. Really proud folks elementary aged kids. get trial? spending eight hours day, homeschool instead crappy online? one pushed us open schools face consequences whatsoever. think wanted less people get it. Keeping everyone work economy moving prioritized everything else places. BC could limit deaths sure fuck willing keep infection rates low outside nursing homes.  second nursing homes mostly vaccinated started removing restrictions huge spikes positive tests.  Lately proven they're either lying variant numbers horribly incompetent tracking them. offer little insight one reason diabetic, often times I‚Äôd goto grocery store multiple times week fresh meat low carb things. pandemic, wanted avoid public places I‚Äôd go month. Generally shelf stable food carbs... Powerpoint shoddy for-profit two-bit program cases aren‚Äôt rising Texas. They‚Äôre lowest point since June. People naive enough think humans going outsmart virus vaccine? Get real. It‚Äôs going away, keep morphing soon enough evading vaccines. Keep mask keep distance. Almost every person know age (21) gotten vaccine lied get it. one cares, one asks proof. feel like sucker trying actually wait I'm eligible (which 19 minutes ago am). Wait, socialization aspects school fundamentally based factory model work. Yes, kids need socialize, bell-scheduling forced-compliance culture best way socialize children? come better way get social benefits come massive pathologies current schooling models? Jesus tap dancing Christ, finish said? Fauci said that, saying hoard masks frontline workers need. someone college campus that‚Äôs taking seriously right yeah, probably. They‚Äôre making reasonable calculation saying they‚Äôre planning restrictions taking back things clear much, much better plan reverse. Thank I'll check Texas barely testing reporting anymore. far Texas concerned covid over. know, live here. keep vaccines super cold temps? Yes vaccinations children priority life household. don‚Äôt feel totally comfortable normal things vaccinated adults don‚Äôt want children get us spread school on. wow.  must Best Parents ever. Best Luck. honestly think issue Publix thing timing donation made look sketchy. Publix pretty much everywhere Florida actually think good idea use distribution. sure CVS/Walgreens LTC narrative DeSantis pushing really makes sense might true? large amount farm workers Latino, risk population pandemic. got political people listening Biden gave platform marketed expert. Feels damn good shut people I'd shocked populous state country people vaccinated. California also beating Florida vaccinations per 100 whopping 2 commenting deleting? two notifications almost four hours ago showing up? Maybe glitch I'll address much able view.

You claimed ""so incorrect astounding"" claim followed science start. assume referring rebuttal way ""vast"" majority country vaccinated ""1 2 months"". 

There two main reasons wrong. 

First, Moderna began manufacturing vaccine early July Pfizer began manufacturing vaccine October. first doses began distribution mid December. today, 162 million doses given, 59.9 million people fully vaccinated, amounts 18.2% U.S. population. order us reach would vaccinate 2.8 times many people next two months last four. say majority, said ""vast"" majority arbitrary, let's assign value 50% 100%, let's say 75%. 75% country vaccinated would need deliver four times many vaccines half time. Also please forget, three weeks doses (except Johnson &amp; Johnson), need get roughly half country first dose next five weeks make 2 month cutoff vaccination. 

Second, right even 75% country wants take vaccine. polls 62% either willing take vaccine, huge improvement last four months. add number people might willing, least indifferent, resources, access, accessibility can't bothered actually show get vaccine, percentage drops further. getting vaccine requires positive action, however slight, getting vaccine requires nothing. evidence might recent election saw record turnout, still six ten eligible voters actually voted. 

Your second comment simple, stated vaccine gets FDA approval remember conversation something sounding like ""pathetic clown"". get impression think I'm anti-vax, I'm not. I'm personally invested much hope vaccine gets full approval I'm already fully vaccinated. support making vaccine, especially one first kind, mandatory requirement participate society anyone finished fully testing it. know several people choosing wait vaccine receives approval respect position. close minded asshole referring anyone chooses wait ""stupid"" ""fools"" Ultimately, everyone's going different attitudes disposition pandemic. take adult case obviously want. long keeping dad safe there's much else asked you. Hope well. Absolutely. need keep hearing though everyone know terrified ""variants"". I'm honest sometimes too. reading virologist body work say really calms down.  Honestly, fact might already it. say ""might,"" whole house tested positive, except me. Also, half workplace got it, except me. complete speculation, think I've already gotten back developed immune response (or double masks I've wearing since last February/March really effective). doctor agrees speculation says likely I've already it. long term effects, I'll probably get either way. kids 11 under? go school too. Makes sense, would love see age distribution though, suspicion uniform throughout ages mental health declines seen younger generations younger generations ones impacted pandemic restrictions, like yea sucks 40-year-old work home already built career good amount savings, compare 20 something year old got college, massive debt, can't find job, able really fun student still going debt lackluster education. counter argument one handled covid well singling DeSantis according political affilations? Wow lol. somehow always anti-masker's fault hey. Michigan state non-compliant people. Texas &amp; Florida renowned populace mask &amp; restriction abiding citizens. Ok ur US though I‚Äôm glad something good came :) 
And agree partly, it‚Äôs nice spending time family *Boom*. shit antimask talking point dead. states prioritized seniors healthcare workers. people frontlines Florida should‚Äôve able get vaccine start. That‚Äôs slap face thousands Florida healthcare workers gone much. Feel like T-Cells underrated component throughout whole pandemic He's murderer regardless transcript correct. Single anecdotal data point here. Working home (and working less), getting spend time family, forced spend time outside fucking wonders mental health.

Again, everyone's situation different. mine. Yes, also far stores they're going stop maskless people check vax card. easier everyone mask herd immunity vax achieved. 37.3 ¬∞C (99.1¬∞F) headache even count syntomatic case vaccine phase 3 trials. get worse looks like vaccine worked exactly advertised.   well, backed data japan: guess people assumed would translate countries, maybe Cool. drink there. Maybe spend minute research. hit 8000 cases day Michigan, highest months. already well next wave. AZ vaccine contain aluminum.

There vaccines using one option becomes clear problem. That's think caution currently. There's good indications vaccine least curbs transmission degree, guess particular variants flying around globe right now, want see much vaccines bring transmission down. Hopefully greatly. hard comprehend virus exponentially grows? OK, I'm looking chart, 12 days serious sharp change slope. Here's question - rate positive tests, correct? usually test positive 5 days infection give take. indicates really immune system actually primed week out.

Not I'm gonna act that. couple low risk activities may start two week mark. Like riding small groups friends. Especially since like half people team long-vaccinated health care workers. like said earlier, voting person caused lots cases corona, far actual fraud cases. support id laws, dont support vax vote laws, must support universal mail voting laws. otherwise, arguments simply impede legal right vote millions people good reason You‚Äôre gonna fine chill buddy course normal -- wake year-long coma? part ""global pandemic killed millions, still yet"" seems normal you?

and nobody saying forever, except you. Like mask mandates, like vaccine rollout, temporary measure intended address unique challenge handled well? shit situation all. longer let run control area likely mutations occur make infectious. That's evolution works, viruses infect people ones survive live spread another day. Ineffective tests.   No, post comes across essentially making teacher‚Äôs fault virtual learning isn‚Äôt aside it‚Äôs aspects. opinion, it‚Äôs even remotely except basic ways, ways make sustainable real length time. Maybe misread misinterpreted meaning, seems lot people misinterpreting meaning, maybe it‚Äôs it‚Äôs conveyed? intending last question snarky. I‚Äôm simply disagreeing believed comment about. I‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôm incorrect. sure live Detroit area, mass vaccinations Ford Field. Got first one today there.

Finally good reason outlaw children spoken family that‚Äôs staying China, lock 5 last yr . case reported. lock city n rest China moves . N yes nothing abt vaccine spoken abt . would relief?

If risk people get vaccinated, seems odd eager get kids vaccinated even considerations around giving vectors virus mutate. educational perspective American children already developmentally screwed. It‚Äôs odd fast go poo poo‚Äôing educational system adequately preparing kids attend college become independent adults, suddenly worrying lack schooling going stunt developmental. 

We progress along pretty standard developmental continuum. plenty important skills taught home interim may actually close gaps children normally experience (like learning manage money, make friends outside school, manage time, complete chores, explore new hobbies, etc). Congratulations! Big agree. many virus deniers sub? would wonderful lifetime vaccination since can't know sure yet i'm glad testing boosters &amp; vaccine specific variants prepared needed.  vaccine makers taking chances. trial Haydon taking part testing third dose Moderna vaccine tweaked protect specifically B.1.351 -- that's got -- third dose original vaccine volunteers, too, see boosted immune response safe provides report last month Pfizer suggests people get doses keep strong immunity least six months. Experts pains point mean immunity stops six months. means that's longest volunteers trials followed see immunity is. likely last much longer, Hensley would surprised learned year vaccines still producing strong immune response,"" Hensley told would surprised vaccine get once.""
 would make vaccine akin vaccines measles flu vaccines. Vaccination measles protects infection life 96% people get gist argument. AZ trial South Africa showed really poor efficacy (11%) South African variant. Granted #'s small large CI, still quite bad 95% CI (\~-70% \~49%). concerning implies AZ vaccine might effective preventing transmission South African variant possibly even poor efficacy preventing severe disease. see pick choose read study people informed topic you.

Keep you‚Äôre doing. thank later. Trump refused authorize defense production act force companies make n95 masks. US supply gone China beginning pandemic, going shortages matter what. Kushner friends started playing games scant supply masks exist, pitting state state. 

Of course Fauci tell people buy medical-grade masks. weren‚Äôt enough healthcare workers, falls solely feet leadership group Whitehouse. basing standardized test scores? standardized tests little correlation future outcomes. amount time spend teaching test, doesn‚Äôt surprise stop kids start poorly tests. 

American education notoriously mile wide inch deep. Covid, 12th grade NAEP scores indicated majority students fell ‚Äúbelow expectations‚Äù category reading math. It‚Äôs also pretty well known average American reads 6th grade level. online learning. 

So, take grain salt. mapped curriculum across 2nd-12th grade plenty ways remap curriculum adjust meet students they‚Äôre get least 6th grade level graduation. Honestly, middle high school curriculum boring results high levels disengagement anyways. seems like huge opportunity make real changes, versus rushing back model wasn‚Äôt serving Americans. It‚Äôs really hard we‚Äôre willing flexible. mentions one strain. I'd defer experts virus taxonomy. think semantical clarifications perhaps one could argue ""variant"" becomes strain if:

1. allowed larger amount immune escape previous infections, Brazilian variant &amp; South African variant shown propensity for, and/or
2. showed significantly different virulence tropism, B.1.1.7 variant seemingly showing greater efficiency zeroing ACE2 cells often 0.7log increase viral load. cares interviewed him? credentials checked out. changed rules ACA people pre-existing conditions get healthcare

By ""just changed"" mean decade difference denying service/employment health history

There's actually huge difference. Public accommodations employment discrimination law completely different insurance law. might leniency vaccine checks service/employment **right now**...

Well, right now, decades many companies required flu shots employees, also decades many universities required vaccinations. mean, think everyone immediate family already required get vaccinated prior 2020 service way stand court long term

On basis would challenged? anyone curious likes look graphs. one saying anything ""for sure"" evolving situation even smartest people still learning. stopping people taking precautions! amazed vaccine made available short amount time, way trust way impressed science technology. 

No one forcing anyone anything, want travel, recreational things, etc. time pandemic zero problems showing proof vaccine. recommend taking precautions conclusive data comes majority people vaccinated. government absolutely corrupt many ways people claiming Covid19 vaccines control are, opinion, taking way far.  #1 people legitimate reasons cannot vaccinated. need protect them.

#2 Vaccines 100% pass. much less likely 2 vaccinated people would fall innefective range yourself. taking medical advice Jim Cramer now? Yes stupid study bunch data backing increase anxiety/depression substance abuse. interesting findings are, important forget associated factors still significant paper bit head, think that‚Äôs they‚Äôre here: shit kids aren‚Äôt vaccinated yet Variants wound infected anyways. ones dead they. Stop doom gloom Whoever fuck decided kids need wear masks fucking idiot know HIPAA is. therapy great treatment depression, various antidepressants psychiatrist may prescribe. whats helpful depressed money. hopefully somebody whispers bidens ear team ""looks into"" canceling student debt yet, children can't vaccinated time. means spread mutation continue among age group. Children currently vaccinated means continues spread mutate among them. need careful reinfection means. Technically get Covid exposed second time absolutely fine. immune system working job. technically speaking reinfected. think sub uses term like exposed go symptoms bad worse. besides outliers, that‚Äôs happening. teacher hybrid year we‚Äôve outbreaks none traced classroom. Students kept 6ft apart masked, honestly seems key everything. Even lunch pods didn‚Äôt get sick. outbreaks traced parties, carpools, spread athletics... although unclear that‚Äôs practice practice.

I say we‚Äôve seen much communal spread recent parties point fall. example Halloween party attended 50ish seniors 5 got sick rest obviously quarantined. Two weeks ago party similar size produced 15 cases. idea tests typed strains definitely seems contagious students even reckless job thing suspect though. Walmart Amazon hiring entire time, seemingly couldn‚Äôt find enough people work. healthcare. didn‚Äôt job pandemic, probably didn‚Äôt really want one. ""hmmm...ill get back that"" I've AZ vaccine, wife too, felt pretty bad like flu vaccines past (which avoid years).

But UK deaths hospitalisations falling dramatically clearly good thing.

AZ vaccine traditional viral vector type, unlikely see anything else unexpected medically population, new mRNA vaccines astonishing untested large scale - really hope nothing unexpected discovered line months years come... confusing. claiming Fauci, cdc, everyone else ringing alarms bells risk variants evading vaccines somehow massive blind spot cells? nations top doctor arguing whether vaccinated people still transmit virus guy heard entire pandemic matter fact vaccines basically invincible. comments frankly sound good true vs many peers saying red flag me, sure hope right wrong Fuck Oprah bringing Playboy bimbo Jenny McCarthy show instead doctor talk autism. Yeah fucking stupid solution meantime kids sized N95s. continue baffled situation mostly agree wear masks, mostly wear masks work well.

There hundreds thousands-millions doctors HCWs treating COVID patients year gotten COVID. possible? N95 masks. stay safe year seeing multiple infected patients per day, kids might see one two classmates get COVID whole year extremely low risk catching it. Lollll tho? play video games day, watch YouTube, Netflix day. looked thru cdcs mortality dashboard. drop almost age groups, significant change oldest age groups. also drops sexes, states saw drops well. interestingly, arkansas actually saw big increase suicides reason repeated chastised refuting claim suicides would higher. sounds like you‚Äôre struggling hold original argument acknowledge doesn‚Äôt actually work case parent.

There‚Äôs correct answer isn‚Äôt actually way implement one solution fix problems. It‚Äôs grey. It‚Äôs complex. it‚Äôs complex every family dozen plus variables they‚Äôre working with... compounded hundreds families within school. One biggest problems states continue try solve problems district, state, national solutions. doesn‚Äôt work every community needs challenges. Individual schools really charge creating plans meet needs students families. Federal government really needs help provide resources that. rest us stop commenting peanut gallery, odds don‚Äôt enough information adequately address issue.

Could people fleeing Myanmar due ongoing protest military coup. feeling takes root center chest. Nope, like assholes sunglasses coats appropriate baby suffers. sad. Two son's serious mental health issues this. looking forward summer.  I'm sincere ask this...do sources show masks effective? Lonely people socialize enough comforted many others same. lean little way myself. Point well taken. probably really good news US, UK countries good vaccination supply/plans. it‚Äôs also good news even takes get countries vaccinated, variants hopefully still succumb vaccines start whole thing over. five month old feel way  St. Clair Lapeer counties Metro Detroit area. 

They're generally Republican counties lot hoax. Whitmer nazi. Masks anything.

The top 3 worst counties among reddest counties state.  mean... don‚Äôt really want kids sitting bar whether they‚Äôre vaccinated really appreciate response, thank never put restrictions allowing kids certain age wear mask. One many problems led spread. wonder many kids showed symptoms ended killing someone without knowing. Many read, including people fit, skinny also passed away. Yeah still got shit wage hey, least got vaccine shot!  Remember could gone people would locked month properly traced infected. Shameful. wonder prevented that. kids thinking they'd actually take care them.

I've heard line thinking times pandemic, I'd like take time call complete nonsense is. I'll also preemptively apologize forthcoming rant feels disproportionate intent comment.

My wife worked way povery/near poverty high stress, high responsibility careers pay well. promised many years ago kids would never listen parents screaming one another extra dollars electric bill. don't. even know much fucking electric bill is. 

Nights weekends I'm outside playing video games teaching play drums sports whatever. week we're working make sure college fund growing, go vacations, get swimming lessons, send killer summer camp, whatever. possible work full time raise kids full time. ""not thinking we'd actually take care them"", leveraging appropriate resources (i.e. schools teachers) take care planned expectation comes fundamentals, school going better job would anyway.

/rant That's exactly we've entire time? suggesting anything novel   colleges probably fall. Sure, would take anaphylaxis saggital sinus thrombosis day. Much lower mortality morbidity.

But right that's exactly sort informed consent need. blind faith gonna ok.

For record already Astrazeneca shot. agree risk low thought I'd get way chance. Oh hey Itz Dare Ape R. Must feel amazing daring ape named R.

Also answer yes. Vast majority vulnerable covid vaccinated turn reduces hospitalisations/deaths.

Way intentionally miss point. would categorize type belief conspiratorial anti-vax nonsense (suggesting vaccines deadly life insurance companies cover you), rather general ""hesitancy."" think important distinction. data cdc find Apparently it‚Äôs much easier test antibodies antibody neutralization test cells. Presumably cell analysis requires specialized knowledge equipment.   think dude making commentary cases lol  headline misleading. implies variants problem *in absence vaccine*. That's patently false.

Many Americans want vaccine cannot get it. That's especially true people live cities.

Around world, vaccine shortage much acute. variants ""hype"". places already back normal. Europe might take little longer eventually end. People 65+ 5-6 percent likely develop Alzheimer's, certainly explains that. 

As accidental injuries, think much paramedic response time, increased rate overdose generally they're safe they'll force take 'em! surprised 60 minutes absolute dog shit. register vote vote, thats typically prevents fraudsters voting think they‚Äôre really conservative general minute tell people vaccinated don‚Äôt need wear mask, it‚Äôll give everyone excuse doesn‚Äôt want wear mask wear one think private business stop requiring them. want go test positivity % nah That‚Äôs really bad idea. one years ago helped. guess could handy times gets tough. One big talking points opening early would sharp increase suicides. happen. Open movement take responsible extra Covid deaths? Michigan increase ruse drive Vernors Ginger ale sales Ain't shit getting N95. 

Every new case failure precaution. Either individual around them. Anything else fatalist nonsense. Many already show id. J&amp;J vaccine seem large drop efficacy. AZ truly ineffective vaccines, would likely due use wild type spike protein rather stabilized one Pfizer, Moderna, J&amp;J use. tell people google stuff sufficient answer.

Pretty sure could safer population terms effects. discussion long-term damage kids?

Nothing obvious light contradictory evidence.

Also, argument children getting vaccinated (at least thread) risk, allow virus mutate, creating new variants.

That risk current vaccines protect variants, right? can't both.

Either vaccines protect variants future proofing kids 'unknown' risks, don't, kids vaccinated risks variants threaten vulnerable currently vaccinated.

Can't both. ‚ÄúWe entering darkest weeks pandemic‚Äù cases dropped cliff Yup, one vaccined coronavac ! Yup. Never understood argument. Anyone who's sad last 13 months said themselves, ""this get better COVID's over."" one kills middle acute situation. suicidal person planet still going run danger.

People kill dust settles nothing better, everyone else recovered they're still struggling.

Plenty real arguments lockdowns/restrictions negatively impacted society, one (and nearly ""classics"" anti-lockdown redditors) dud.

The real arguments restrictions targeted arguments particular restriction. real large-scale societal negatives weight gain (future cardiac deaths), missed education, increased domestic violence, massive mental health declines, decreased productivity (e.g. major setbacks academic research), widening wealth gap.

Suicides never factored real arguments happening academic circles. ‚ÄúWe entering darkest weeks pandemic‚Äù right cases dropped cliff Seriously people dying en masse China would way hide it.

Thus event 10 people unvaxed roughly 4.5x dangerous event 5 people vaxed 5 unvaxed. 

It gets really complicated big crowds, imagine packed bar 50 people 50% vaxed vs 80% vaxed. 25\*24 vs 10\*9 6.7x risky. Perhaps we're 30% vaxed now, that's 2x risky 50% vaxed (US end month?). 

This patient wait. vax coverage increase seems like linear factor, spreading risk crowds square vax coverage. vax coverage accelerating month. week wait mingle, buys us big difference risk reduction. read particular article, virologists' presentations I've seen optimistic vaccine effectiveness say cautious obvs variants still arise. think communicated public well news articles tend panicky nuanced. 
Fighting transmission partly wanting wrong waiting evidence, vs going biological plausibility fewer infections means less transmission. third consecutive year decline.

'Double mutant' COVID variant emerges U.S. Here's means
Variant two notable mutations key investigating coronavirus variant India they‚Äôve dubbed ‚Äúdouble mutant‚Äù whose emergence coincided rapid spike cases.

In case, phrase ‚Äúdouble mutant‚Äù nothing total number mutations variant carries. Instead, Indian health officials gave variant nickname carries two important mutations critical part virus: part virus attaches cells, officially called ‚Äúreceptor-binding domain.‚Äù

That part virus also best target antibodies. antibodies block receptor-binding domain, viral particle incapacitated.

‚ÄúWhy that's concerning get vaccinated start developing antibodies, perhaps mutations make likely us get infected even vaccine,‚Äù Dr. Smith said. ‚ÄúNone that‚Äôs really borne real life, speak, scientists looking it.‚Äù

These two important mutations called L452R E484Q. letters numbers scientific shorthand express changes viral code. E484Q means 484th position sequence, E (glutamic acid) replaced Q (glutamine). lean way. Either I‚Äôm naturally introverted. Regardless, pandemic really took pressure came socializing. people do!

We don‚Äôt talk kind.  sure uncivil. mod please review restore comment? Amen professional teams vaccinating staff players now.

Although heavily advertised mentioned  
Exactly. Norway 4 fatalities 140K AZ vaccination total. vaccine used mainly health care workers Norway, usually young female. 

You need calculate vaccination mortality subgroup compare covid mortality group. still mental health crisis hands restrictions, we'll pay later. complex rate suicides. Addiction, substance abuse, depression, anxiety, stress, etc. part mental health. going magically disappear life returns normal. I'd rather covid mental health issues (mainly depression addiction) developed last year. 

Teenage mental health claims went roof 2020 someone already cited. [Depression increased Yeah, restrictions totally caused mental health crisis /s that, massive outbreak october-february, fact MN MI outbreaks weaker east west side states respectively probably contributed low case numbers WI good LEAST six months six months worth data far. vaccine around long enough study long term effectiveness. article correct. wear mask go swim, obvious reasons. Also regional governments adapt rule, regions already put rule place since last summer. example Canary islands need wear mask moving around beach, crossing people, going beach bar etc sitting towel go water.  thromboembolic events one million narrow fx 50. vaccine might risky young people areas low corona infections vaccines available - even delays vaccinations weeks (in Denmark overall effort delayed ca 2 weeks AZ removed program).

What saying - clearcut indicate. Thanks - reassuring. also depends risk actually getting covid - everyone going get vaccine - subject one risk, everyone going get covid. individual may pretty confident ability avoid risk infection (depending circumstances) whereas way avoid risk vaccination it.

 also wonder whether higher fatality rate clots subgroups - example young health women. Surely European Canadian regulators must good reason actions? 
Anyway, think room bit detailed information detailing risks ( done) rather ""its good"" getting authorities.
Not anti vaxer - AZ vaccine myself.
 
Just wonder needs targeted particular age groups preference others. Reddit rly doesnt like extroverts huh? That's great point. I'd also wonder much Astra Zeneca messing trials affected well.

Wasn't one concerns Astra Zeneca trials effed dosage (I think less intended) continued testing effed-up dosage amount consistency.

At point wonder reliable data could missed learning study? Maybe clotting condition might've come more, knows? good ""at least"" 6 months long (since trials started) assumed last longer thought mass shootings went 2020. mass shootings incident 4 people shot? always make national news. know that, saying Myanmar news little light bulb lit head.  said, notorious scandal fraud.
 Reading articles indicate atrocities taking insurance money employees paychecks paying premiums, meaning employees really insurance. notable incident, one employees suffered motorcycle accident, lost leg, slipped coma, woke nearly 500k debt due insurance paid into. 
There read about, man stranger scandal, police, news. really call average person point. 
But knowledge power, maybe sources read things skewed.  got 2nd Pfizer dose Late February. I'm hearing good SIX MONTHS???

That makes little timid. I'm technically staying locked another 2 months least. What's going happen 4 months? people even less right?

Am perpetual lockdown? personally mourn loss antivaxxers. like old joke: call 1000 lawyers buried necks concrete? good start. alternative answer I've heard ""somebody ran concrete."" Yeah, sure, inferred context fine. lot people either can't won't, though, using imprecise language gives ammunition argue with. AZ vaccine traditional viral vector type, unlikely see anything else unexpected medically population, new mRNA vaccines like Pfizer astonishing untested large scale

The viral vector DNA vaccines new mRNA vaccines. difference mRNA disappears rapidly enter cell core, human DNA present. Thus, side-effects mRNA soon vaccination, nobody knows long-term effects DNA vaccines. I'll everything avoid DNA vaccines. Yeah Italy here, az young people elder:.. get right?! ‚ÄòNo one kills middle...‚Äô


How say people kill themselves? don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going peoples lives can‚Äôt make blanket statements like that


Just made doesn‚Äôt mean people do


Stop making bullshit absolute statements long stays america, that's okay. feel like people 50/45 vaccinated, young adults / teens (16-25) next get shot, suffering worst non-medical consequences pandemic + probably group infections due going college, busy social life, etc, etc assuming everyone take 2 tests week? might order test ever show symptoms time lockdown hopefully people vaccinated need them.  Varies vaccine variant question, they're generally showing less effective.

*But* well protect strains. people get vaccine passports?

The vaccine passport photo name attached, must validable time, forgery prevented. 

That would mean illegal immigrants would accounted state database. Sputnik V good mRNA vaccines. Evil where?

Sinopharm also effective, Sputnik V mRNA vaccines. *if* variants virus problem, vaccinating individual countries first everyone rate death sentence us all.

Beware! new covid! locked again! Clamor fear! Clutch pearls!! I'm sorry hear that, corrupt government Australia well well practised cover tracks pretty well, corruption problem almost everywhere.
We lot Covid conspiracy nutters really, confined fringes, powerful business interests pushing agendas main we've resisted them. 
The state government live caved last May led extended lockdown they've since chastened strictly adhere scientific advice.
Once bitten twice shy could say.
Good luck it, hope get vaccine program order sooner rather later. Unforetunately care homes like movies. lot patients malnourished, dehydrated, get care require require much care enough staff people care. I'm certain US much better care homes Romania people still people. I'm Neurologist almost every time get patient nursing home neurological decompensation stroke dehydrated kinda skinny. I've also seen pretty terrible shit. lady looked almost like guy Se7en (the one bed). Unless family pay good money elders taken care usualle end ""you get pay for"" situation. worse variants now. use correct terminology, sensitive (relative PCRs). certainly catch asymptomatic cases, viral load. Fuuuuuckkk fear mongering website covid eat dick You‚Äôre trying dig. opinion seemed obvious first comment. Covid killed kids don‚Äôt know long term effects. parents would concerned that. think it‚Äôs paranoid getting vaccinated would relief, instead saying initially, patronized. okay? order magnitude. Per Johns Hopkins, 1.8% US. Good luck, man. share birthday, apparently, bad habits. quit smoking October go see girlfriend, sort fallen wagon bit. I‚Äôll quitting fully date. Taurus strength stubbornness carry us through! must rich friends considering China vaccinated like 2% pop UK using AstraZeneca main tool coronavirus. stop halt vaccination safe efficient vaccine, would delay effort months. increase immunity population personal level outweighs risk far. UK no-brainer. 

For countries like Canada, Norway, Germany Netherlands however, strategy slightly different. countries mainly rely Pfizer + second vaccine (J&amp;J EU). may suggest looking risks subgroups beneficial, still vaccinate subgroups different vaccine without really delaying effort decreasing immunity population. becomes ethical question chance death covid compared chance death vaccine particular groups. Personally think health authorities countries go on; risk still really small - understand looked into. mean, check phylogeny maps, 6000 variants listed Sputnik V (russia) Sinopharm (china), think lesser two evils? (assuming, course, choose one). recollection study last year showed cells COVID infects initially primarily develop puberty, meaning kids biologically resistant it. Perhaps strain different testing lot kids. way? Totally willing listen good argument correct.  way? Totally willing listen good argument correct. don‚Äôt really understand 18s treated considered differently comes COVID. Even personal responses different (due to, assume, age) they‚Äôre still amongst general population therefore pass like anything else. cost-cutting distinction kind? population whole benefits outweigh risks. clots effect everyone equally, chance dying covid gets progressively lower age essentially zero babies, age risk individual vaccine outweigh risks illness.

I think overlooking fact risk clots ""essentially zero"".

I found meta-analysis age-specific infection fatality rates Covid , published December. estimated age-specific IFR low children younger adults (e.g., 0.002% age 10 0.01% age 25) increases progressively 0.4% age 55, 1.4% age 65, 4.6% age 75, 15% age 85. Moreover, results indicate 90.

Meanwhile risk clots taking AZ vaccine seems order 0.0001% 0.001% (1 per million 1 per 100,000). still seems clear daylight vaccine risks Covid risk age groups eligible vaccine. want company pumped millions dollars expedited development novel vaccine millions set factories produce vaccines keep demand give vaccine free developed nation ample means pay it? They'll continue prolong it, like celestial idol prolong another appearance next several thousand years. Novavax likely next vaccine UK approve, they've gone third phase trials started local production. /r/nothingeverhappens :( Saying ""re-openers"" kind slur straight Orwellian. see lot talk vaccine passports think lot people talking past definition varies much. 

I've heard people say vaccine passports needed anything, go grocery store, jobs etc. opposite end i've seen people mean literally international travel certain occupations like working nursing home. 

I think much people would okay latter former. 

What mean vaccine passport? 

Without clear definition impossible comment support all.  Seems root problem in:

Unless there's handy app company like say IBM making 100% handing companies time got there, long stayed, places scanned in, (if part digital wallet) things purchased.

Yeah they'll keep around that.

That said, yeah probably right. business owner wants deal shit longer necessary it'll slow business down, US businesses ditch soon can. community mass surveillance testing schools staff. students required tested, ""feel sick"" ""told stay home"" ""we ruin sports everyone.""

In words, there's contagion deliberate non-reporting. Thank seems like understand vaccines work. getting one risking life. risking lives people can't get one, people got one might still get sick. extending pandemic even longer. 

Imagine thinking vaccine passport burden 550,000 Americans died senseless deaths people even handle two weeks lockdown . something like post-polio hypothesized caused damage motorneurons CNS (brain stem + spinal cord). 

The CNS happens whack ACE2 receptors, that's COVID uses replicate. loss smell people experience result damage around ACE2 receptors result virus‚Äîit knocks sense smell damage olfactory support cells, damage happening wherever ACE2 receptors high proportion e.g. around pancreas organs, intestines (hence GI distress people) CNS. wanting busy social life, facts data.  sub US-centric. coronavirus exists here. There's evidence yet That's messed up, sounds like show watched called ""You cat pay take away"" Yes. wanted make sure healthcare workers; would guaranteed exposure; would protection. Folks like commenter think kind ""gotcha"" instead necessary planning telling us they're stupid without telling us they're stupid. Seriously. like medical sanitation 101.....01. really thought common knowledge. America? Exactly. Museums, science centers, even non-socially distance kids. kids learn much social interaction, socially distanced hard, also harmful developmental ways. ID ap phone scanner stealing data from.

Seriously, OK showing vaccine card? Want put ID? fucking go ahead.

But giving free info establishment telling exactly time came in, places been, long stayed (your phone likely able recognized establishment) free data establishment that's requiring it.

Worse ones put mobile wallet? fucking stupid someone believe stealing purchase data that?

Always assume ap tech service feasting data. like really need vaccines tho...send Spain even pfizer JJ? particular reason why? instead saying initially, patronized. 

Actually, asked questions see reasoning behind it. ended conversation opinion position asking questions elaborate it, trying re-interpret whole thread tone, inaccurate.  Israel even need vaccines? 30% population 18 can't receive vaccine. far around 60% vaccinated, leaves 10% people never get take it. ...we‚Äôve looped back around still missed irony.

There nothing, anywhere, constitution, protects voting without ID.  wait double mutant murder hornets. Twice size, twice stingy. Yeah, risky going long drive. ""Affraid"" Look, want flash copy vaccine card, yeah ill understand.

They want app phone use another way steal user data? Yeah can't see problem there?

ANYONE believes sort passport ap handing data scanning naive actually impressive. course, world median age 30, Africa 20 even.

The risk younger people dying, damage kidneys, pancreas, lungs probably brain.
Unfortunately, robust numbers yet, I'd prefer based reports younger infected health care providers. It‚Äôs probably stop health system collapsing. Papers, please. Maybe said something like would except something like banana republic, organized country? Still sounds weird. Let's hope Johnson &amp; Johnson actually deliver amount timely manner. first delivery 19 April indication wait till get C, D, E, F. people making mistake lumping every branch gov't one, singular entity saying, 'BAD!,'. everyone get y'all. nuance all, sides. Lockdown poorly implemented lot places  prediction: Europe US fully open mutual international travel July, want cross continents need show proof full vaccination. also going include countries good vaccination pace, Israel, Emirates, Morocco Chile. Unless country abnormally high case rates (such Brazil) also able travel may need test upon returning. we've seen UK Israel, transmission collapses hit 50% vaccinated. October probably restricted countries going let in, Australia China example see open mid 2022. great move. 100%

It'll unwieldy massive distrust phone aps this.

I work bar industry bay area, zero ways majority owners take policy on, many pay lip service legally required to.

Plus, effective window pretty small, months mass vaccination finished. Like everything else, people hearing people hospitalized covid left right they'll ask carry proof around heads covid over. chase dollar guarantee bars like would abandon requirement.


What think people sides issue need realize temporary. hate idea it, I'm willing bet September nearly establishment unless they're virtue signaling, like policy surprised favorite places either bother employees lax time. going rules vaccines require live campus.

Well 1) deadly age group 2) No? inconvenience I'm referring passport. Palestine would've able get since israelis already vaccinated

What terrible timing math explain cautious. 100% right math. even math see scenario vaccination ongoing hospitals get overloaded point triage becomes thing. group vaccinated far vulnerable. point long medical system handle need allow people freely things get sick deal we've always done. math show point now. 

I get quote article problem is, lapses don‚Äôt slow us down. set us back, way repeatedly opening oven door prolong time takes bake cake (and, worst, make delicious dessert collapse). made much progress, risk lot impatience. right now, we‚Äôre serious danger botching grand pandemic finale.

How? seems people getting sick adding number people immunity. IMO it‚Äôs time start diverting doses away states low demand giving states high demand. states allocate doses away low-demand sites towards high demand sites. Go vaccine spotter website look Pennsylvania. There‚Äôs little available Eastern PA, especially greater Philadelphia area. Western PA swimming vaccines. Yes... lets forget race instead focus blaming political party! Another great way divide nation! Yeah nah fuck that, see results UK strain country. hype, real people dying.

Not everyone concerned new strains saying vaccines work them. agree you. Yea... I'm gonna say no. Depression much worse, even though I'm introvert cases pennsylvania rising? Remember kids adults told us get vaccine unless least 5 years old? Yeah....good times.  understand, efficacy vaccines massively undersold national medical community, Fauci et al communicating like lawyers. mean is, whatever reason, maybe liability, whenever uncertainty outcome, emphasizing hell it, even probably sure pretty good idea likely happen.

""We strong evidence yet masks protect you"" gets heard ""don't wear masks""

""We know yet vaccines protect asymptomatic transmission"" one hears 'yet' even You, loving supporting family easy. Maybe appreciate them, definitely easier people live forced isolation. mean look conspiracies, happened Jan 6. aren‚Äôt magically okay suicides down. There‚Äôs doubt still going mental health crisis. Well, it‚Äôs difference block vaccines paid vaccines fully paid. Also epidemic situation Israel better countries, 3 fully vaccinated people, don‚Äôt see issues blocking vaccines pay. course Israel poor country verge breaking due covid, would different situation. I'd surprised true. California people people wearing masks ever Getting vaccinated deadly disease inconvenience? ‚ÄúThese kids selfish. Don‚Äôt know there‚Äôs literal global pandemic? Kids resilient, they‚Äôll get it.‚Äù - sub, March 2020 - March 2021

Seriously, concerns hand-waved away first year, anyone could‚Äôve seen problems shutting kids flushing education, activities, socialization toilet endless months year plus. 

If kids ‚Äúresilient‚Äù, wouldn‚Äôt whole industry therapists help people get things happened kids. 

The way kids, teens, young adults lives cast aside name preventing one specific virus - completely without regard secondary effects - terrible, we‚Äôll dealing fallout years years. Cutting vaccine shipments might sound evil Israel way ahead everyone else vaccinations. company likely redirecting shipments rather holding waiting payment. would frustrating company one country getting many vaccines others dire need country even pay bills. Redirecting vaccines probably saves lives going places need more. It‚Äôs also good business decision bills get paid faster too. Pfizer might sound powerful also operating whims government. countries factories decide block exports trouble. countries providing needed supplies cut exports trouble. can‚Äôt seen profiteering also need spend lots ramp production. would tough CEO right now. said, far vaccine rollout speeds, think raw number doses far important. Ultimately, getting millions doses huge country enormous population harder shows much ""achievement"" seen Germany.

As Indian, personally care reaching herd immunity vaccines faster. per capita matters reaching herd immunity. 

The second wave frightening people exhausted stopped following guidelines. Vaccines way out. made false equivalence. Local lawmakers ban alcohol sales want, whereas voting restrictions must justified reason exist.

That means constitutionality requiring id vote debatable. Judges disagreed addressed, existence dry counties explicitly protected section 2 21st amendment. Possibly coz everyone boring routine!
And ppl go insta Facebook etc see others awesome things wondering life dump üòë hype Regarding 2 3, early statements ""middle"" pandemic. early on, know expect aerosol transmission possible, asymptomatic infections definite. yeah, data changed things little. 

I agree would nice come say, ""hey, I/we know much early on, here's need know more."" Legitimately good luck lol. It‚Äôs nice here. means add 6% week # Canadians 1 dose received likely happen. even administered every dose distributed provinces second doses delayed 4 months still imposing super stringent criteria get dose instead opening broadly? EU look like bad guy again, rich countries really think deciding optimistic based possibility people make bad choices hear good news. 

I say anything suggest that. I'm saying worry people, already reckless, hear tiny bit positive news think everything back normal. low-information types proven time willing ignore basic safety measures even tiniest excuse.

Also, talking people surround toxic positivity... article. Alternative? Heck. No. got vaccine already I'm going okay people wait get $100 giftcards Alright well put way makes sense lol. Oh please, stop playing victim here. likely change title prove stupid beliefs. actually read article, didn‚Äôt mention it‚Äôs related mask mandate lifted. fair percentage state vaccinated caused this, article mentioned.

Yet post title tries make seem correlation two. Moron. Here's random unrelated question. Keep hearing surge next month. Everyone urging people get vaccinated, soon people actually get protection shots since take month month half fully vaccinated? hear mrna 80% 2 weeks? 1 week? protection build? someone get vaccinated protection next day? think read way either...but tainted read story multiple sources previously. 3 kids effect one's life global pandemic? Hmm...good know Well then, RIP right wing narrative shutting would costly life virus itself. I'm sooooo surprised angle load shit. 65 million full vaccinated people.

It's less 5%. likely group refuse vaccine Republicans, white evangelicals tend fall group. bet looks non-religious Republicans, trend would hold. (Google take many sources Republicans‚Äîthis isn‚Äôt partisan.)

Meanwhile, religious groups providing transportation vaccine sites hosting vaccine events. It‚Äôs really fair lump anti-vaxxer crowd. Many churches great asset community. 500,000 people dead... ‚Äútheater‚Äù  important question one asking much Publix, CVS, Walmart paid administer shots. get vaccine free receive fee give shots. really important number know. Sorry ridiculous banana measuring contest.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* really depends level risk willing take on. scenario groups *fully* vaccinated like proposed, probability vaccinated person transmitting virus another vaccinated person low. Additionally, fully vaccinated people tend less severe reactions COVID likelihood becoming sick and/or hospitalized exposure greatly reduced well. 

In short, long virus still circulating always *some* risk associated interacting people. said, risk fully vaccinated low continue become lower population vaccinates. No. However can't anything work already forgone conclusion integrating society require one soon things open up. virus country(UK) contained. vulnerable vaccinated experimental gene therapy tune 60 percent adult popualtion, way necessary save NHS, 99 percent people end hospital safe, presumably. 


If vulerable vaccinated NHS safe overun, need take gene therapy vaccine nonsense zero risk dying would need prove vaccination status beer people vulnerable it, protected? control mechanism everyone thinks otherwise follow logic all. Good luck new normal. thought narrative lockdowns bad caused increase suicides?  Get tested then. lot less people checking older folks kinds health issues (or catching time, diagnosed) they're trying avoid elderly loved ones accidentally infect/kill them. That's think see idiot antivaxxers protests. protected infectious diseases thanks parents seeing impact diseases vaccinated first hand. poor kids agency getting short end stick. chuckle Covishield AstraZeneca vaccine produced Serum Institute India. 

Basically, vaccine AZ, batches manufactured SII branded Covishield. EU country tho. guys ID, means voter suppression, need public safety, it‚Äôs government overreach. Got it. According company, 91.15% patients treated Pegylated Interferon Alpha 2b, PegiHepTM reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) negative day seven, compared 78.90% standard care arm phase 3 trials. Also, drug reduced duration supplemental oxygen 56 hours 84 hours moderate Covid-19 patients. guess depends country. Finland expected late June/early July everyone 16 would've received least one dose. I'm saying everyone difficulties pandemic, stupid say someone's allowed complain difficult choice made 5 years ago ended putting hem particularly hard pandemic situation. It'd stupid said someone struggling loneliness, ""well choice kids deal consequences quiet house pandemic comes up."" people got shots farms. Others signed alone website various languages know done exactly US UK 4 measures I've copied below.

-The coronavirus vaccine programme continues go plan

-Vaccines sufficiently reducing number people dying needing hospital treatment

-Infection rates risk surge hospital admissions

-New coronavirus variants fundamentally change risk lifting restrictions

Are US following similar guidelines? haven‚Äôt touched cable media almost decade. things media try push little scientific effort mostly bullshit bullshit stars Free vaccine end user yes, everyone involved producing distributing still getting paid government it. Yes, recommended wait feel better immune system dealing something aside vaccine. probably ask questions symptoms getting vaccine ask come back later. Seriously Pfizer vaccine worth weight *gold* right now.

Some countries frothing mouths get ahold shipment lol. Better watch out, someone might call antisemetic criticizing Israel want miss vaccine bit. like feel bad around 90% instead 100%. Um article didn‚Äôt answer headline remotely. didn‚Äôt even give year expected delivered in. could 2025 reader would know. made false equivalence. Local lawmakers ban alcohol want, whereas voting restrictions must justified reason reason exist. 

That means constitutionality requiring id vote debatable. jump overdoses unexpected compared trends seeing opioid epidemic overall? Like expect increase much? Would take account ????

Many countries west rely vaccine. 

China many asian countries already safe. dont time stress vaccinate everyone. take time. 

Which also china send 100s millions vaccines doses countries. donation cheap deals. 


Especially countries dont buy power get vaccine, Europe north america buying doses. 
And also EU western countries one voting let countries produce vaccine common good, small countries buy want it. cases could well explained social distancing one, says, one known strain novel coronavirus -- original one, SARS-CoV-2, first discovered Wuhan. And, two, there's evidence far variant meaningfully evade vaccines, though several variants there. 

Which it? even bother reading article? data shows least 6 months, almost certainly much longer that. Reported - allowed report facts disagree POV /s really, shocking two men arguing preventing vaccines paid for. top argument preventing people vaccinated, causing deaths meantime. Again, two men arguing.

I‚Äôd say quite country‚Äôs leaders could calling out. Yes that's believe daddy dictator tells you. source. AZ fine.  annoying entire family took precautions wearing masks, sanitizing hands, social distancing, yet entire family got sick. Let's see whether corona dad's test comes couple minutes great actually this, im sure lot countries cities push testing want play numbers game. (Less testing means less positive cases right?) CDC guidelines say wait two weeks second shot, people gathering, except people one household. Israel pretty much right wait FDA approve vaccine 12+ edited part comment. late think, apologies. Except chose three kids mortgage. didn‚Äôt choose coronavirus.

Also nice I‚Äôd compare family plague Sure. 

But 70k+ new infections daily really can‚Äôt expect put mask much.

Thus - current state affairs.

Stay safe. Let‚Äôs hope USA vaccinate way mess. point bias starting shine through. pay Everest climbers pay.for vaccine even eligible. making false equivalence. Local lawmakers ban alcohol want, whereas voting laws must meet certain standards regard undue burden. 

That means constitutionality requiring id vote debatable. one asking to. know anything them, get vibe 100% effective. guess type people fighting free healthcare üò¨ activities within country? 

If i'm visiting cancer ward hospital full people able get vaccine work well think reasonable demand show proof vaccination can't visit. OP looking nothing reddit gotcha moment. OP anti masker looking articles push narrative. reality, article OP posted clearly states reason decline hospitalizations due people vaccinated OP continues ""but mask mandates gone cases going down"" gotcha moment. OP getting downvoted. That's how. smart strategy small country.

Well, decide screw vaccine manufacturer paying. Heh, use RTX 3080 bot well Yeah, perhaps. kid went pharmacy every shot, would records multiple dose shots could ensure administered correct times.

Maybe activity needs proof vaccination, could visit pharmacy get vaccination card made, store pharmacy? Dr. Fauci ""tinfoil hat wearing moron""? There‚Äôs link Pew survey data breaking religious affiliation race. 

Consistent text article White evangelical segment highest percentage saying wouldn‚Äôt get vaccine February. segments aren‚Äôt far behind terms percentage would guess White Evangelical larger population segments. reopeners delusional people going crazy sub. knew it. Y‚Äôall 4th wave. realize 64th fortune 500 considered 'relatively small' temp workers essential farming industry.

Ok, necessitate quarantining? saying important exploit workers' cheap labor worry pesky little COVID thing? What‚Äôs option? Tell us Good job geocide enabler. Looking forward big vaccination numbers week. 

Also, Dr. Gottlieb good news CNBC today. Talked aren‚Äôt seeing decline protection variants real world personal insults. Yeah mean within country - international travel big deal certainly can. Universities already anyone entering campus fall semester person classes. prefer fear mongering inoculated. Send Palestine instead. rest worst meanwhile still little vaccines, deep lockdowns crowded hospitals... hid massacre 3,000 protestors hiding ongoing genocide. makes think can't hide this, especially virtually foreign verification Case point, Xiaomi latest product launch event full capacity China. indirectly shows Chinese need social distancing measures anymore because... feel real threat covid.

Miami beach full capacity. indirectly shows Americans need social distancing measures anymore because... feel real threat covid. 

Hopefully see bad argument is. another example Netanyahu step down. makes sense. read one said study 6 months, likely keeps safe much longer.

Either way, I'm eligible yet since I'm still somewhat young, another reason I'm rush. still think vaccine voluntary people make choice help doctor. agree safe tested, I'd personally still like see long term study. 

Thanks helping explore topic! I'll definitely consider severity reinfection next time talk doctor.  banana day keeps republic away. Interesting! wondering got everyone vaccinated quickly. diverted shipment Palestine. hid massacre 3,000 protestors hiding ongoing genocide. makes think can't hide this, especially virtually foreign verification data? think can‚Äôt mandate vaccine isn‚Äôt fully approved FDA. Army mandatory vaccines currently recommending Covid shot due EUA currently. it‚Äôs fully approved sometime summer schools make mandatory cute he's like little mini putin clinging power avoid corruption charges. Charming really sure issue headline, complaint got read article here's current headline appears app: Climbers Return Everest, Already Dangerous Ascent Becomes Extra Perilous it‚Äôs right world hasn‚Äôt got chance even first vaccine series finished Ok, laughed!  Damn that's really unfortunate feel like group people holding things back kinds folks. Oh no, wealthy. can't possibly allowed live. Straight-up racism, cool. Yeah, that‚Äôs saying comment receive compensation distributing shot? doesn‚Äôt say article didn‚Äôt catch segment last night. TIL enough people refuse

As time goes vaccines show safer safer, people becoming accepting them. always loony morons won't, relatively small number.

We fine. vaccines proven resilient new variants, booster shots become thing needed.

In near future, Covid nothing flu, least America.  Zillions! Hahaha, what? OK. think everyone wants vaccine get it, longer worry restrictions protect unvaccinated. They've accepted risk. There‚Äôs proof this, anywhere. Chilean living turning-into-Venezuela Chile Whenever read someone willing live restrictions wonder think restrictions first place really demanding here. That's honestly pretty good idea comment chain worldly discussions only. Make thread want get political it. said they're redirecting vaccines go countries need more. see someone make bad argument like that, weakness argument pointed them, wonder. aware argument poor hoping nobody would notice? Otherwise it‚Äôs evidence good constructing sound arguments.

The end result data point supporting statement, ‚Äúpeople prefer nationalize companies disingenuous poor thinkers.‚Äù makes little sad, would much rather debate issues.

This aside. Apologies ramble. selectively using facts got 4 atrocious years trump.

Its vaccine related dunderhead possibility less Evangelicals... Oh... like Marek's Disease leaky vaccines? That's majority upvoted opinion UKs main coronavirus sub. They'll refuse use vaccine passport tests 'shouldn't prove they're healthy' participate social events, they'll 'drive cases up' 'theyre inflate case numbers extend lockdown'.

That's genuinely overwhelmingly popular opinions main covid sub.

Not saying majority opinion everywhere there's certainly large, vocal minority going encourage non compliance. sorted controversial find exact comment correct. enough people refuse, disease find areas mutate find way infect vaccinated people, causing pandemic start again. 

It's problem seeing antibiotics, people finish whole prescription surviving bacteria stronger resistant another dose antibiotics. Old people real slow... hard tracking em down.  think distrust vaccine related fact certain groups see increasingly outside mainstream detest that. also trust government much used government moved outside consider mainstream. 

Hence, hear directives rest society asking take vaccine, immediately skeptical, mainstream society become much less religious are. tides turning. MSNBC's Morning Joe criticizing Boston open enough. can‚Äôt stop thinking ‚ÄúSuper Fan‚Äù Alabama Crimson Tide, died past Friday covid complications. 23 years old. brother parents. really beloved AU, team memorial him. become defacto mascot team practically, attended pretty much every single AU game past season.

I think it‚Äôs huge set back idea we‚Äôre able go back normal now. NCAA tried hard everything right make things safe, happens?

This legacy now... generation long stain. said everything done right would safe, something like happens. 

We honestly people back stadiums yet! aren‚Äôt past yet. Coronavirus yet.

This totally depressing.  question one answered me. also thymectomy wondering vaccine got pointless. plan get antibody test find want go around thinking immunity don't. Versace band-aid, Gucci Pen write vaccination card ^ This. vaccine available demand anyone wants it, account lag time necessary last categories people available get full efficacy, USA. 

At point religious loonies own. I've set sneaker/ps5 bots book vaccine appointments they'll going eBay soon.

/s right, we're trying much safer before. Let's go 90% efficacy round number. vaccinated meet fully vaccinated group someone group unknowingly exposed COVID 5 days beforehand (not got it, least exposed), risk 1% would without vaccine. person 10% likely gotten 10% likely give you. 10% 10% 1%.

From there, odds getting hospitalized worse seem less 1% based well vaccines prevent severe cases. What? Pfizer‚Äôs first dose provides 82% efficacy higher AZ‚Äôs total efficacy two doses Vaccines go brrrrr take shower get work? question can't seem get answer to--what thymectomy? cell scientist know thymectomized person would capable producing novel cell antibodies? trial currently, take months best, probably years. Stupid people stupid. vaccinate people instead?

Yes, make sure vaccine 100% effective 100% take-up groups.

(Or focus do, reduce transmission younger, healthier people currently zero vaccination). Sure. understanding though herd immunity isn‚Äôt obtained enough us getting vax, nasty variants worried about. Something resistant we‚Äôve achieved far. vaccines going stored warehouse. They'll shipped countries need. Israel already enough every citizen, hasnt paid future supply, think reasonable company ship instead distribute countries need Yeah stupid, (as people age getting it) say shit like ""I trust something getting inside body"" yet party travel without mask COVID something bad getting body. 

Anyways I'm millennial getting mine hour fuggoff young anti-vaxxers really though? few, sure, really signifigant enough? Every game fails catch predator... herd immunity tinfoil hat wearing morons looking reason get vaccinated.  Well article vaccine hesitancy USA, I‚Äôm talking USA. highly recommend run Chrome install RPT. And, no, build stats time post history, that. plugin browser identifies people certain traits. 

And nothing ""sub troll,"" pretending people imagine complex system involving lot different variables two. common thing there's really merit argument.

Good luck search truth.  35% Covid, anyway, means 77% covered vaccines (whether previously infected), plus additional 8% natural immunity, giving 83% (or enough herd immunity 100% efficacy R0 &lt;6, 75% efficacy R0 &lt; 2.64).

They're also least vulnerable group eligible vaccine, children likely vaccinated greater numbers eligible. 

If older, vulnerable groups higher take-up (i.e., achieve herd immunity across entire population complete, vaccination complete R0 less 4), Covid's final wave likely smaller largely confined young healthy.  UK people

- refusing get free vaccine

- refusing take free twice weekly tests incase means self isolate

- refusing use covid passport (ie proof vaccinated recent negative test).

It's like want locked overwhelmed hospitals forever. I've conversations similar people before. unfortunately waste time. People set ways confirmation biases. place none :( - changing but... UK began beginning December. first one use Pfizer vaccine. sound bad bc fuck Netanyahu.. Pfizer also playing monkey middle Latin America vaccine requesting military bases return sending vaccine \*\*So far, Israel spent NIS 2.6 billion coronavirus vaccines, revealed last month meeting Knesset Finance Committee

\*\*It understood Israel paid much per vaccine country.

\*\*Pfizer halted shipments coronavirus vaccines Israel outrage country failing approve transfer payment last 2.5 million vaccines supplied country, *The Jerusalem Post* learned. understand fast. overbid fuck pay. 4d chess Oil, bananas - potato, pa-tah-to would make sense aerosolize vaccine air burst cities method. Insurance companies (and can't probably shouldn't) this, businesses alter much contribute towards healthcare. least Ohio, many friends companies contribute towards coverage meet certain metrics (get yearly physical, non-smoker, exercise, etc.). know companies given yearly bonuses getting flu shot. If/when things set employer, bet see people getting vaccinated. Calm jigsaw. see. Well, math, seems around mid June reach percentage people second doses Israel right now. However, pace definitely going increase many people needing second doses, honestly expect things start pretty much normal around late may/early June. Could wishful thinking, math checks out.  Walmart give fuck. 

I got shots there. *was* eligible. ask insurance gave paper check box eligibility. could‚Äôve marked whatever wanted lol person behind counter didn‚Äôt even look it. Good hear! Meanwhile Denmark still wait around 4 months vaccine we‚Äôve also hit hard guys get people saying stuff like this, ""lol progressive HYPOCRITES!"" zero proof left leaning people want better healthcare common anti-vaxers, pretty sure opposite right now, concerning part upvoted comment here. Combination lot right aligned people past months others seeing top comment whatever says must good deserves upvoted. want elaborate think obvious seasonal? Ah, thank clarifying. Fair points, all, speaking worldwide impact. is, eat less calories shot makes lot sense anti-lockdown views became overwhelmingly popular opinion overnight, lets hope sorts it. enough entire country yet 58% vaccinated also concerning... Scaring punishment ""the stick"" ""carrot stick"" analogy. would propose motivate people? Bro one cares relative suffering thing. Telling someone suffering someone else suffered worse magically stop former's suffering. Ugh send Taiwan! take them!!!  there‚Äôs available, gets sooner. isn‚Äôt hard understand, make Reddit argument it. IMO public confused b/c really confusing. Science infectious disease control forest probabilities, confounding variables constantly shifting on-the-street reality (which quantified retrospectively) 

The public binary appreciation stuff, either ""back normal"" ARMAGEDDON policy makers really play extreme notes hope averages sort reasonably effective change behavior. understand difference attempt success? cant hide hospitlizations Sounds like foresight. Nobody wanted stockpile n95 masks hospitals yet are. Attack religious freedom clearly underway. They've blamed ""surges"" religious gatherings. they're blaming freedom choose. *fukcing predictable* Again, think perception reporting might problem, reporting actually shows. don‚Äôt know. It‚Äôll reduced sure, much, scientific evidence hasn‚Äôt presented yet. Ah, Israel pulled ol' Donald Trump. Steal goods services simply refuse pay. wonder Bibi likes Trump much. Antivax also want socialized medicine type person made get mad at. Like 99 percent types weirdo liberals Conservatives living alabama saw meme Bill Gates using vaccine make people gay Meh. dad worked government supplier/producer small business owner wouldn‚Äôt get paid sometimes year year half. time get paid efficiently ordered more. don‚Äôt give crap business goes since they‚Äôll pay pennies dollar bankruptcy court. I‚Äôd imagine much money thats changing hands governments would behind payment. really expect company spend billions developing, manufacturing, shipping drug happily pay full cost, you? Governments be, ones paying. deny anything, pointing stupid comment capable hiding severe outbreak. say they've hidden things, I'm saying clearly well everyone knows them. everyone would know masses covid cases. False, you‚Äôre trying spin every argument thread favor Israel. 

Does everyone know Israeli government actually pays people go social media defend Israel? It‚Äôs known Hasbara Project. indistinguishable that. comment history shows that‚Äôs does. Yes I‚Äôm waiting year so, got shingles vaccine I‚Äôm anti vaccine, I‚Äôm anti brand new vaccine. don‚Äôt even download new iPhone update similar reasons They've made announcement think brigading encouraged anti lockdown subs sort issues. Gaza part Palestine Oh got it. It‚Äôs amazing judge separate groups out. attitude groups become alienated act out. could see businesses change cost health coverage get vaccine though. know there's businesses would contribute employees healthcare we're non-smoker, would exercise, etc. health Minister politician Netanyahu's party. said, civil servants within ministry divided issue. It‚Äôs cured single free shot called ‚Äúwill-power‚Äù finished Cheerios anyways, feel free piss them.  Yep, idea wtf New Jersey doing. rollout lot slower NY &amp; seems like Covid Relief Bill fast-track anything around here. still 55+ vaccine, include many medical conditions 16+. Everyone state pretty much lying registration, friends vaxx lines filled young people. I'm getting first dose today, thankfully. I'll add this, exhausting single people constantly told way free time lives way easier people relationships and/or kids. lot thinking leads single people overloaded responsibilities work viewed excusable parent take time pick kid school single person take time find good partner. care people say, dating fun like cracked be. sucks people tend empathy people partners kids people themselves. terrible stigma. Everyone rough time, stop trying ""one up"" people. pandemic competition. religious freedom attack 

Now know fact original thoughts valid.

Have great day. obesity caused addiction; namely carbohydrates. saying addictions lifestyle choices? Lol proposing permanent ban international travel? you‚Äôre US be! unleashed June gather trial. also helpful note media pinning success vaccine white evangelicals shaming them...and kind gracious addressing concerns vaccine way done populations. guess what...alienating group never makes eager fall line. billions humans live Sub-Saharan Africa, India, China, literally never get vaccine still working running water finding next meal? ""pushed polite society"" since continue vectors diseases foreseeable future? confirmed cases reinfection, decent percentage people similar worse symptoms second time.  cute glib, making sure demographic fully vaccinated hard logistics especially challenging geriatric population. homebound, dementia, many weaker immune system may lower efficacy already imperfect vaccine. Furthermore, death less zero young, still concern long term side effects end organ damage. get vaccinated too. Yep - used bike work day old job, new job 2 years pre-COVID taking train. work remote full-time, almost certainly going WFH 3ish days per week office re-opened. bike train much better rare time would use car go work, definitely like extra time bike want (e.g. mornings summer, evenings spring/fall, skip cold winter days). True. Part Operation Warp Speed giving vaccine manufacturers money ramp production vaccines approved would able start producing vaccines quickly. wonder investments calculated part price US paid sunk cost. incredibly rare. Come back black ones try overthrow government. then, no. agree. course, shitty situation people can't get vaccine due medical issues small percentage people got vaccines get sick anyway (vaccines 100% effective). it‚Äôs probably one guy caught hot mic happy able - hope little step helps us all. ü•∞ try get vaccines own, Zionist entity does....so spare BS Palestinians fully independent country full control Maybe Israelis thought electing rightwing terrorists Knesset? Shouldn‚Äôt Israel face consequences want Palestinians? know rare is, testing large scale, sequence strain confirm reinfection, rarely gets done. Seriously, this. Cali entered chat taking page trumps play book? Thank - look forward families peace comes vaccination. üíâüí™ VACCINE HOLOCAUST TOLERATED! I‚ÄôM CALLING LAWYER, ME. hid massacre 3,000 protestors hiding ongoing genocide

not hiding much know fam article even mention T-cells once, best highly misleading fear mongering. BenNe(ta)Nya(hoo) republic Mental health issues compare death. bad, sure, bad dying, least public health perspective. Mental health issues treated. Death cannot. option kills lots people limits mental health problems, option B leads lots mental health problems actually kills people, clearly option B better choice. think missed part hated since country's establishment. countries disagreement policy Good point. ‚ÄúRe-openers‚Äù genuine term? isn‚Äôt sport lol safety country really money reluctance fade naturally people get clearly suffer adverse consequences. caution warranted, AZ shows. know anything 'there' not, apparently enough concern EU regulators pull vaccine entirely. 

But lots companies vaccines potential issues, people see friends families neighbors getting shots moving lives showing adverse effects months later, everyone else start wanting get go back normal. 

About way sabotage process would rushed/authoritarian campaign force people take vaccine punish taking it. convince people there's problem covered up. US wealthy country vaccine distribution much complicated here. easier smaller country less divided value vaccines roll out. think safe say vaccine tested black people

OC wasn‚Äôt saying been. Point being, [it‚Äôs helpful understand root vaccine hesitancy multiple demographics messaging education efforts Pretty sure? Meanwhile, real world... Vods would way many times ??? supposed spend millions developing producing vaccines, get cost back? Fucking hell redditors naive article points cost question negotiated government infighting means can‚Äôt get purchase approved. would part health record. makes even important get vaccine so. get vaccine decline reason object it, might find claim denied get sick. People think shown proof entry everywhere. Like showing ID bar. shit sherlock. vaccine appointments limited. Fewer people asking vaccine appointments means easer people get them. Simple reality. ""Thanks reporting news NYT"". FTFY

Just news make happy, mean true. germans enemy feared. Kids going external threat dangerous it‚Äôs harder rationalize sacrifice making. going isolation downward trajectory it‚Äôs easy start mental death spiral. Okay, question ‚Äúwhich one suggest use?‚Äù Zionists thought what? Nazis?

Your comment makes absolutely sense. *wreaks.

Really cool word fits! honestly thinking world wide ya see point. thanks reply. sounds like you‚Äôve made mind already trying find someone confirm decision.... would nationalizing work? country nationalizes then? Israel? nationalize corporation even based there? not, country nationalizes them, gets decide send vaccines? almost like idea really thought through. Israel pay, apparently opt-out.

China reporting similar numbers Taiwan despite significantly people added protection island nation.

As someone friends extremely extroverted, promise care spare time. miss able live type life enjoy living. idea introverts day sun pandemic add up. Reddit likes conflate introverted hating people completely antisocial, they're thing. I'm happy able cope pandemic, see pandemic made easier anyway. introverts pandemic, seemed difficult wrap heads around heck difficult extroverts. asked stay home, watch Netflix, read book, get hobby, etc. Things introverts generally find pleasant somehow tortuous extroverted friends.

It's difficult all. Extroverts enjoy things too. like *only* things able see friends family. Again, read watch Netflix day normal times fine, understand pandemic makes easier it. pandemic removed option to. many states, vaccine open everyone 18 (or 16 idk) up.

Within next 2-3 weeks, many restrictions. agree. entire goal get Covid insignificant, need create much vaccine demand humanly possible. another thing also need return complete normal life soon possible, drag feet want slow means careful ruining even random people‚Äôs lives. messaging ‚Äúget vaccine, you‚Äôre fully vaccinated whatever want.‚Äù really want say ‚Äúrespect businesses mask rules bit longer they‚Äôre available everyone,‚Äù Even isn‚Äôt much practical reason it. lot stuff they‚Äôre saying vaccinated stuff I‚Äôve able long unvaccinated. Give real benefits people.

And someone says demand already there, don‚Äôt trust polls enough show many people truly want vaccine don‚Äôt trust tje idea lot people want getting soon can. They‚Äôll try get convenient possible. put obnoxious dumb advertisements vaccines everywhere, would really annoying would create demand always good thing. I've read link, literally says ""tougher national coronavirus restrictions"", lockdown. also listened President Macron's speech live happened Wednesday night, never said lockdown, isn't. also live downtown Paris able see what's happening firsthand. addition curfew established early January, they're closing schools 3 weeks (1 Spring break anyways). Aside schools, nothing else changed France. Teleworking mandatory, shops open, people go long want without paperwork. Yes curfew, yes restaurants entertainment establishments closed. sucks, especially people work sectors. lockdown. ‚ÄòDrag thing out‚Äô mean still covid cases pop there, kids end hospital, handful die ... yes, could ‚Äòdragged out‚Äô sometime 2022.

If ‚Äòdrag thing out‚Äô mean mask mandates, distancing mandates gathering limits, working home mandates stay home orders ... couldn‚Äôt wrong. 

Remember - hospital capacity. Based data now, likely covid spread among children put strain healthcare systems. 

Trying keep public health restrictions place order 0 covid risk among children would way harm society whole good. Even risk averse leaders would see negative cost-benefit situation. 

Flatten curve. Reduce stress healthcare system. Get back normal. everyone 35 vaccinated pretty much achieved goal. Where's source that, like said, first examples coming Europe *literally* include face yesterday lot pressure send kids back. People treat like I'm mentally ill I'm keeping kids home. (My parents' medical neglect left lifelong health issues; careful kids result.) Employers supporting choice all. think parents care, plenty given option.

Not all. I'm married idea making costly (for people get vaccinated)is way go. posed alternative. people cannot motivated care fellow human, maybe there's way motivate using cost. car insurance.

 Thanks! 21-42 days Pfizer told got shot. 

That would consistent maximum period 6 weeks report. NJ? Americans happily going around despite high deaths cases India hard lockdown. 

Just saying ""things different"" pretentious. "" lot need one come need one go there? ""

Laughs superpower  ^^^ this. I‚Äôm Texas too... part, many people still taking precautions mask mandate lifted. want to, someone told too. Subtle monumental difference. Pfizer actually test single-dose phase II publication Nature. sure Moderna. 60 microgram dose produced RBD-specific IgG antibody levels 1-2x convalescent serum, whereas giving two doses 30 micrograms gives levels 20x convalescent serum. 

In virus neutralization assay, 1 x 60 ug actually worse convalescent, worse lowest two-dose regimen 2 x 1 ug. 

Doesn't necessarily translate real-world protection, based data, second dose big effect. Except know covid spread vaccinated populations. think we'll need passports early want safe reopening occur quickly, think would long-lived requirement. night clubs/large bars city nearest would welcome passport sorts meant getting rid reduced occupancy rules.

I could see passport rule effect mid-fall vaccine available 0-12 year old crowd. young ones get I'd fully support shutting program moving life.

So far gone plan people getting vaccine, I'm envious reading US letting people shots basically return 'normal' life, everyone scenario told follow restrictions.  things life potential create negative outcomes. use anecdotal evidence risk calculation. plenty data suggests virus spreads, affects most, activities risky. say don‚Äôt know lot virus far ridiculous. know enough, use know make decisions live life. also know enough know vaccine works, made choice get it. UK, too. vaccination effect fighting increased social contact bound result bumpy line variables keep changing. 60% 80% population vaccinated, public health measures including lockdowns needed prevent another wave.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* sure there‚Äôs post link question I‚Äôm planning going back gym 3 weeks. Everyone family fully vaccinated waited wait time effective. question being, ‚Äúsafe‚Äù go again? family cautious, overwhelmingly times, want make sure everything maintain that. However weight I‚Äôve put depressing need get back shape. It‚Äôs fine go we‚Äôre vaccinated correct? yeah looked numbers today shocked cases yet they're still strict. although would surprised stay long, pretty much promised drop restrictions June 21? think coincidence areas restrictions early seeing low cases. North Dakota example, Sweden, though Sweden seeing lot cases virtually deaths interesting.

Remember whole point lockdowns masks ""flatten curve"". curve flattened equally everywhere. Let's say 40% population destined get virus. State lockdowns 40% gets spread 18 months. State B lockdowns 40% gets spread 9 months. ultimately end level, cases front loaded State B.

I think lot less correlation masks cases people think. Slightly less USA. 90,741 per million vs 94,659 per million.  Huh.

I realise sensible middle ground focused protection vulnerable Covid, whilst completely destroying everyone's mental health livelihoods decade come, partisan talking point.

This brain Reddit, guess. we've socialized risk. I'm particularly keen footing medical bills antivaxxers. Vaccination modify viruses making less servere. put selective pressure viruses, variants vaccine less effective selected - spread easily. Whether variants less deadly can't predicted.

Which goal greatly reducing spread. eradication. yeah non-American that's kind impression get. can't really comment whether he's done good job Reddit seem worship political reasons first foremost ""survived"" Trump administration occasionally hints useless Trump was. virus care consider tough restriction, influenced tons things controllable public policy. 

If simplify criminal extent:

**CA restriction measures + voluntary measures**

Public perception restriction intensity: 8/10

Virus perception restriction intensity: 6/10

**TX restriction measures + voluntary measures**

Public perception restriction intensity: 3/10

Virus perception restriction intensity: 5.5/10

Beyond general social distancing, point diminishing returns restrictions. hit another truly beneficial level restriction unless took much, much harder approach lockdown. I'm even going touch topic whether measures would worthwhile. making point TX CA wasteland restrictions fairly minimal effects. good progress going make powdered Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. might taken vaccine developing countries. J&amp;J also good option. US retooling AZ lines J&amp;J speak possible places world too. obviously directly correlated restrictions lack thereof.

Nearly major cities TX still mask mandate, MI huge population political reasons still believe COVID real. They're far apart there. 

Also, article states cases TX still high rising:

""even state health official reported 1,600 new cases disease caused novel coronavirus Sunday.""

Fortunately, majority vulnerable elderly vaccinated, effect reducing hospitalizations (vs last year) US.

What may different MI struggling get seniors vaccinated major cities. Poor transit/mass transit options, limited vaccination sites areas, strong distrust govt. - certainly hindering efforts, along strong prevalence B.1.1.7 variant. They're unfortunately seeing hospitalizations rise now. sucks.

TX may end trouble growing variant prevalence. Even low hospitalizations, prevalence B.1.1.7 P1 continues increase, may end similar problems MI. (high B.1.1.7, rising hospitalizations among younger people - effect b.1.1.7).

We're glad TX better ""Mobile FEMA Morgue"" phase, TX's 1600 new cases / day indicative way over. that's we've proven studies, that's we're willing bet lives on. know protection happens sooner, know much sooner. Israel‚Äôs experience - plateaus small rises, downtrend resumed. think surprised popular vaccine passports are.

There's lot people that'd prefer establishment without rabble would avoid check like that. This. Looking like early next year kids I've heard it,.first dose worse, second dose better.  states already letting baseball fans stadiums would shutdown football games way September Uh, source back claim? administration sites getting headcount there's absolutely evidence disclosure identifying information reported government entity Same.

Sorry, whole thing bullshit security theater. nowhere near sort herd immunity. still something like 20M Americans 65 without one single dose vaccine. age groups starting get vaccinated. huge number Gen Z won‚Äôt get one 16 vaccinated time soon. wave already upon us. 

I live MN seeing case numbers approaching saw October November. also seeing significant rise hospitalizations. Many younger, &lt;45. Us Michigan newly leading country vaccinations yet highest infection rates country. 

Vaccinations going massive impact don‚Äôt see mid-summer. shot arm starts significant protection 4 weeks first dose. majority doses given day actually second doses. order curb wave would‚Äôve need 4-6 weeks ago. wave hit bad. There‚Äôs experts predicting worst based reasoning, one agrees. Italy still is. stop.  /r/lockdownskeptic bullshit fly. Lmao like today. Tightness chest! it!! Oh it‚Äôs actually crippling anxiety making breath weird.

Thanks super nice comments guys. Sometimes reading positive words people really helps. shit.

Didn't already know this? plan entire time? news Fauci says it? Meh science advisor move start. main beef data controlled studies demonstrate prolonged protection.  Data UK though shown good protection, even among seniors, especially hospitalization death, overall numbers seemed show 3 month interval working.

There study certain cancer patients though look like second dose delayed may leave vulnerable extended time period first second dose may make strategy less ideal them. broken clocks, credit due go Michigan that, though. [On see 7-day average new cases US slowly increasing past weeks, looks like plateaued heading back (this could also due new cases past days reported yet). meanwhile, deaths dropping like rock, expect continue since vulnerable populations largely vaccinated  Exactly. end June, Germany administered minimum 70 vaccines per 100 people, probably much this. means 3 months Germany much vaccination process UK today. UK already showing great numbers! year though. month. depression everywhere would suicides down? Like minimum maintain right?

Separately depression people seeing loved ones they're asked wear mask mall grocery store Uh, pharmacies clinics registering people get shot.

Your state knows. new variant seems resist natural immunity? still younger people priority groups (police, soldiers, etc.) younger 60 receiving now. example, published today 50K soldiers vaccinated number reach 70K end week. Anyway coment, ""younger"" meant younger current age limit (65). suppose plenty people aged 60-65 receiving well.

In case, currently official policy reserve Pfizer, Moderna J&amp;J 65s next age groups general population (e.g. 56 59, 45 55 on) would also receive AZ. Although obviously policy need change turn groups actually arrives, otherwise would actually excess Pfizer enough AZ groups. longer dosing gap used Pfizer UK well though. UK using 50/50 AZ vs Pfizer, supplies skewed towards Pfizer first months. Oh, okay then. I‚Äôm cool. assuming goal open up.

It‚Äôs not, right now. Yup, grandpa diagnosed cancer told year live blood treatment he‚Äôd die weeks. order get treatment would facility visiting hours. decided didn‚Äôt want spend last year life alone hospital. Instead got die home surrounded family (luckily one got covid).  Fascinating insight, newsday.com . really know that! I'm boat, got Moderna 3 weeks ago, went casino ate dinner indoors, got migraine day later (which get every often) I'm going grab test tomorrow case. feel totally fine now, can't hurt take 10 minutes sure am. Outside high school (for obvious reasons) we've 1 kid per class transmissions classes. really well schools following protocols. yep. united states commuting worst form transportation, psychologically speaking, relatively short commute (30-40 minutes ) enough cause issues. 

i think major part many people always pissed hurry, spending significant portion life car commute. Got second dose Saturday. side effects sore arm either dose. Definitely grateful minimal side effect possible. even think stay bars long most. 

Where used cruises/resorts. cruises tend take older people vaccines might work well elderly, helps it. Also cruise want risk dock somewhere someone needs get ventilated. Flu 10 times less deadly 

Is 10 times less deadly immunocompromised people though? least NY baseball, Mets Yankees attendance capped 20% allowing fans in. people get vaccinated cases continue decline it‚Äôs likely capacity rates will
Increase Yeah. That's kid needs hear. Fauci says this, Fauci says that, Fauci knew much would blown whistle early last year say pointless wear masks. two masks soon 3 doses,then booster shots every 6 months new variant protection lockdowns Yeah, I'm sure factors lead surplus. Makes sense. seems like many pushing agendas instead giving information like people make informed decisions. fact print something trusty HP all-in-one, prove widespread fraud claiming. Covid prior vaccine? wonder body‚Äôs reaction vaccine window reaction actually Covid would be. 

I say moderna shots symptom sore arm. actually less tender second vaccine first. would asymptotic I‚Äôd Covid? Hey I‚Äôm boat you. It‚Äôs worth remembering regardless outcome regulators, still extremely rare.

It‚Äôs stressful situation, I‚Äôm sure end ok. you‚Äôre struggling feel free drop message - plenty us situation Contrary narrative British media, one ‚Äúwants‚Äù UK fail.

The consequences would far wide:
- Africa‚Äôs population 30. would render AZ useless Africa
- then, there‚Äôs topic risk coming from? spike ? vector? Several vaccines commonalities AZ‚Äôs means vaccines may share risk.
- finally, there‚Äôs confidence issue. Even it‚Äôs restricted 30, people 40 start distrust it. Never mind whole confidence British scientific community literally lined vaccine. *experts* claiming vaccine efficacy results useless compared.

Maine finds funny Day three won‚Äôt catch much all. even half cases. day 7 test catch 90-95% actual cases. Day 10 closer 99%.

Because everyone actually infected, odds specifically positive missed day 7 test isn‚Äôt 1/20.  It‚Äôd like 1/200 1/500 (because you‚Äôd 5% chance infected first place.)

Don‚Äôt trust day 3 test.  Best quarantine least 7 days. 10 would better.  highly contagious day two symptoms show, feeling okay doesn‚Äôt mean can‚Äôt spread people.  better waiting four weeks risk losing spot altogether...

The biggest factor queastion ""bacteria virus?"". Bacteria geneticaly rather stable, immunity bacterial infections lasts longer, mostly forever. Viruses little complicated. 

Viruses usually mutate, meaning change appearence and/or behavior induced genetic mutations (random changes). viruses mutate more, leading shorter immunity timeframes, less leading longer immunity. Flu common cold mutate regularly common. often infect people, leads reproduction, leads mutations. Pox measels almost eradicated, dont reproduce often, fewer chances mutate.

COVID-19 common now, mutations likely, leading shorter immunity. nothing really wrong rollout aside fact enough vaccine yet (and something crossed point return months ago could changed). whining bitching, 90% delivered doses administrated.

Does mean dose wasted? course not. like wastage missmanagement made significant difference. Double mutant E484K L452R mutation (from India said) helps aid immune evasion we‚Äôll see much aids seeing mutations aid evasion keep mind risk individual take vaccine remains extremely low.

I‚Äôve seen anything says can, Reddit talk, I‚Äôve seen anything says can‚Äôt either.   Well, well see true say Darwin can't understand that. Kids far adaptable adults, thought. classes went boring hell (except teachers, including one collapsed dead putting much energy courses) ; dreaming drawing day long got fluid mechanics engineering degree, so, prevent personal work ! kids india book pen would dream situation whining first world kids right computers tablets right contract reached Matt Hancock's desk, former adviser said, health secretary refused approve it, include provisions specifically committing supply UK first.  fear export controls - EU, US. Mr Hancock worried president Trump would stop vaccines Merck leaving country.  university Merck ""as close signing dotted line could be"", stopped going ahead, want risk intellectual property rights Oxford vaccine ending hands single American company.  meant confirm happy, would happened immediately,"" said former adviser. ""But wasn't, overruled officials block deal.""  seems like right J&amp;J vaccine given emergency authorization, lower efficacy rates. Yet experience couple months later, seems like one people leaning towards given option. opinion this?

I'm unsure changed. would go imagine impressive rates produced, one shot obviously bonus, logistics refrigeration, concerns mRNA technology, high protective rate severe Covid illness. I'm asking subreddit J&amp;J vaccine knowledge used US currently. know countries authorization doses, seem compare. 

If given option, would select? understand one offered obvious answer. surplus, would select? surge way back fall? argument made, bet emotional health suffer lot parents friends die. too. phrase got fucking old quickly. Argentina president got covid vaccinated doses got second dose‚Äîfelt amazing it, like drank 3 cups coffee, I‚Äôm starting feel bit crappy. super nervous too, it‚Äôs bad expected! parents fully vaccinated, fine live life more. Go see friends, go spend time loved ones seen regularly. would think nobody left standing line it, would everyone concerned getting it. Hopefully soon. trying argue. You‚Äôre babbling. 1 2 months unvaccinated population minority. Vast minority. Bunch loud mouthed anti vaccine fools left dust. feel way. drink more, that, that's exactly feel! masks accounted control group also wear masks.

It's measuring masked vaccine masked without vaccine, gives efficacy vaccine.

If control group unmasked unvaccinated, correct call masks confounding factor. School needs return full time, another year hybrid, online. comes teacher, potentially putting risk too. 

I bet district still require masks, fine that. also going need forceful sending symptomatic kids adults home, something along. family leaving New York vacation hitting hometown. hour hour updates situation terrifying even threatened us felt like experiencing apocalypse. favorite answer. I'm guessing they're either idiot referring data whether vaccinated individuals still transmit disease. Exactly, first year college (which pretty close glorified high school lot time) saw tons kids would basically skip lectures learn entire course powerpoints Khan Academy. large numbers people comfortable choice, I'm pretty sure students high school level least could easily achieve desired outcomes nearly online material needed. scenario try. responsible option go ""pretty much"" normal normal.

It never ""cool"". always depressing, dehumanizing thing thought necessary evil. Tolerating, let alone encouraging people bringing flu office incredibly dumb hopefully stays dead. No, shut schools community spread **in city** high. spread schools. policy 7 day rolling average positivity passed 3%, schools shut did. nothing results surveillance testing schools. still positive cases schools even positivity around city spiked. schools went back January cases still high still surveillance testing still significant community spread schools. talk confidently something aren‚Äôt well versed on?

I get it, every bit logic points kids nasty super spreaders. evidence doesn‚Äôt point that, least young kids proper protocols place. like too, fully expecting school reopenings would drive cases evidence isn‚Äôt there. changed stance saw science pointed. Granted, part reason NYC successful strict protocols. Surveillance testing, mask mandates, automatic school shutdowns 10 days 2 untraceable cases, travel restrictions teachers staff. doubt schools probably spread result. you‚Äôre saying factually incorrect. NYC operated person school comprehensive surveillance testing community spread high. Getting second Moderna shot tomorrow. tend get pretty high fevers get sick, preparing worst. 

I keep seeing mixed information taking fever-reducing meds shot, consensus using Tylenol reduce fever caused vaccine? school Notably, link *doesn't* say infants wear masks unsafe (which original claim.) find ‚Äúcompletely put life hold‚Äù comments bit much. means something different depending are. people pulled back various things materially change life, may feel life‚Äôs hold. Alternatively may feel, put life hold, necessary. 

That believe none friends got virus great. never put much people touting never got virus despite behavior. things going contribute spread even don‚Äôt think got sick personally. definitely think people friends take proper precaution sort bubbles knowing safe hangout within group. That‚Äôs going option everyone though. haven‚Äôt restaurant all. seems utterly safe don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôve missed anything major giving year. idea going restaurants unimaginable sacrifice beyond ridiculous. It‚Äôs enough friends whatever amount time. Haircuts, too, seem like something many easily managed getting great loss especially going less. numbers fit. know someone going blind, signed still get shot age group. Look CT. talking vaccinating 16 years up. NJ lagging. wonder vaccine effectiveness per person per year be.

Right know effectiveness values Biontech, measured weeks vaccination, nearly single-encounter risk reduction values only, 90%+x asymptomatic, symptomatic deadly cases. Rest educated guesses wide confidence intervals.

It looks bit like could increased effectiveness severe disease vaccines lower effectiveness symptomatic disease, Biontech, values seem almost identical - evasion strains, high effectiveness, could narrow outcomes vaccination respondents/non-respondents. That‚Äôs thought. spread bullshit around ‚Äúpapers, please‚Äù narrative confronted, hide. think we're still point rising numbers cases young people bleed vulnerable groups vaccinated yet. Unless Florida  Sure. I‚Äôve got anecdotes you‚Äôve got yours. experts still lean one direction other. could wrong, much likely right? Suburbs teacher here. Tomorrow get full classrooms, social distancing ignored, masks 5 days week courses end 8 weeks. They're prom. They're outdoor graduation. us least second shot vaccine none us fully vaccinated. parents nightmare too. keeping happy. keeping entitled kids happy. Age private information reveal prove you‚Äôre medically safe participate. dont happen you. madness? Everything pretty much back normal midwest USA I'm at. people wear masks yet think that's still good usage taper summer bet. 

Granted YMMV, live somewhat rural area havent covid case county two months. yeah pretty much everything open like normal lot restrictions dropped already.

And half people area still going life usual last year too, nothing shut since last March unless specifically Covid outbreak place business.

I guess countries vaccinated fast still going moving goal posts still need careful.

I must missed memo saying masks, distancing, careful near end cool position site anymore. take much salt want. know friends experienced, experienced. never claimed vaccine hesitant fact received doses Moderna. also encourage patients get vaccinated. go ahead make false assumptions. 

Given interest good faith conversation want attack me, I'll go ahead block you. I‚Äôm confused. experts saying even you‚Äôre full vaccinated, can‚Äôt things like travel, etc... fuck live life? What‚Äôs end game here? mean Fauci saying masks next year. CDC saying don‚Äôt travel even fully vaccinated. category 5 guy Osterholm talks like world going collapse. 

Do know something don‚Äôt? vaccines effective told? refuse believe experts saying stuff without sort basis. dedicated life exact scenario. task force dissolved Biden took office. 21 dramatic increases, rising. ain‚Äôt handful.

The concerning thing trend cases dropping stopped states.

It‚Äôs mess. get better right still serious problem.  data? I‚Äôm 17 know 18 year olds school who‚Äôve gotten vaccine. also plan jump vaccine signups. Bye. understand coming really appreciate taking time sources. 

Alas, agree disagree.  Oh hurt feelings. stop spouting fucking nonsense. super spreader concept still exists. majority people catch covid actually spread it. 10 percent people spread everyone encounter spread reason goalposts moved kept doubling non pharmaceutical measures never going control virus contagious. airborne respiratory virus isn‚Äôt practically containable measures required simultaneously put large amount strain populous also require unrealistically high cooperation. put together, doesn‚Äôt work. plan needs people cooperate perfectly long isn‚Äôt practical plan. 80 dollars two shots going prevent lot people preexisting conditions getting vaccine. I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs free elderly Pakistan likely won‚Äôt able cut deaths quickly countries selling instead allocating free need. respectful get thread. India 1.3 billion people 100k new cases isnt much. would like US less 25k cases scaled it. That's extremely low Last one kinda specific lol wrong.

No, wrong. 

They supposed partner Merck KGaA, **German** company connection Merck Co, US company. 

Facts matter. Fears export ban US relevant decision partner Merck **Merck German company**.

I mean, little confusing, *that* confusing. seeing spike Texas all. seeing agree, people soft now. locked 13 months finally got shot. Im trying snarky all. I'm telling truth, ""expat"" largely anglo-influenced. mexican went work states, expat? no. Again, none data stated false.

Be well. Peace out. No, haven‚Äôt strict. bbq‚Äôs camp outs friends family summer. started getting colder rates went way fall, hunkered down. husband 40‚Äôs health issues, we‚Äôve far conservative you. Also, beyond looking health, would devastated get someone else sick, especially someone higher risk. that‚Äôs enough motivation avoid lot indoor activities risk aerosol transmission. stop already. You‚Äôre entrenched idea we‚Äôll living ‚Äúpapers, please‚Äù authoritarian country, that‚Äôs case. Schools require students vaccinated show proof vaccine records, going decades haven‚Äôt lost freedom that. Get already. argument 100% agree it. Unfortunately, aren‚Äôt providing mental health support , opening schools ... 

If it‚Äôs mental health, provide mental health support get back academic stuff later. schools. opened back fully assumed everything good, true. Kids ages unsanitary hell, expecting diseases spread utterly moronic best. lot kids learn watching lecture. learn interaction teacher peers teach concept work problems. Khan academy great concept taught, great stand alone.

I taught algebra intervention classes attempted use khanacademy platform. Lessons tasks assigned kids worked pace. finished 40% end year successful core algebra class.

And im picking khanacademy, true aleks computer based program. took trig online college, professor berger online lectures. class learned least took. I'm sick too, I'm devising plan nuke destroy China never happens again. Paywall 7.7% Michigan tested positive, versus 10.0% Wisconsin. Michigan also larger surge testing.  card gave you. real, honestly, buck up. get vaccinated. think hard really make definitive statements effective virtual we've centuries experience developing in-person school, system completely based around assumption in-person way done. We've basically done virtual one year brought short notice poor preparation, used people ever used things one way.

A lot virtual seems worse results probably fact used using hundreds years expertise telling us doing. would bet kind emergency forced virtual learning entire generation, would see gaps results diminish greatly everyone began learn adjust using effectively. anything all? mean never mind Twitter, Reddit calling Texas ‚Äúdeath cult‚Äù lifted lol.  wouldn‚Äôt surprise me. need Bishop healthy right answer. Stephanie Silvera, epidemiologist public health professor Montclair State University, said continues hear discussions getting back normal. She, too, cautions talk.  said campus, ‚ÄòWe would like fall 2021 look like fall 2019. make happen?‚Äô‚Äù Silvera said. ‚ÄúOne colleagues said, ‚ÄúWell, short time machine, don‚Äôt. We‚Äôre never going back.‚Äô **It different learned something. Otherwise, lot people died good reason.**‚Äù

This kind thinking going keep us returning life knew it. tragic people lost lives understand want make lives mean something. However permanently imposing draconian near draconian measures accomplish that. Trying force people wear masks forever permanently enforcing capacity cuts restaurants concert venues sporting events make deaths mean something. get trying high minded trying feel like helping go far. 

To important things need learn are: 

1. caught flat footed? deficiencies system got us point?
2. fix deficiencies? parts system strengthened? Changed? Done away replaced?

Spend time resources finding answers questions accomplish hell lot forcing people wear masks mall rest time. particular news ignored D614G mutation already observed China immediately January 2020, within month ""wild-type"", within months became dominant strain first Europe wave first NYC wave. wave ended, media completely ignored mutation existed. prioritized teachers getting vaccinated. Source? much happen year. hopeful next year completely behind us, almost global scale. I‚Äôm vaccinated there‚Äôs fucking reason wear mask grocery store wanting get kicked out. practical Covid prevention reason, vaccine already brings transmission chances large amount. Yeah get that, still think would need say vaccine + measures lead level effectiveness. can't take variable. That's like saying pulling condom 90% feel free pull good! least northeast increase cases largely due variants. Massachusetts brazilian variant spreading rapidly cape cod area. also need look percentage positive tests well. getting 2 3 percent tests positive testing enough college moved home live parents pandemic. I'm moving back May.

I've cutting hair. last movie saw theatre Cats. Upward trend =/= surge. Cooties Disgusting attitude. eventually work out. variable many people get sick die due acting like it‚Äôs over.

Hell, can‚Äôt even agree switch plant-based plastic solutions... all. want make sure dumbasses don‚Äôt mingle. goes way back even. Fauci also bungled aids epidemic 80s way.

Oh, bet reddit even know that, guy ANCIENT, he's always incompetent joke ([Kary Mullis, Chemistry Nobel Prize winner inventor PCR test said even worse Fauci back Nice misinformation.

Chinese Sinopharm also pretty good, least amount sides pretty mild. 75% efficacy so. elderly using it‚Äôs antibody response doesn‚Äôt flare often. think trials 'disaster' 

No, *were* disaster, AZ investor. thought could cut corner stage three trial (probably due lack experience vaccine managerial development US FDA standards) bit ass. eventually get right, soon enough factor US market (and EU market jeopardized). *preliminary* study true relative ineffectiveness South Africa strain, bad luck, incompetence.

They probably release relevant information public domain. matter jacksquat, 3rd world market swill purchase sketchy vaccine doses startup 3rd world companies, AZ gotten vaccine production hiccups smoothed out. AZ eventually make profit vaccine, going jackpot. People seem realize Pfizer Moderna viable 3rd world; they're expensive produce &amp; store, compared J&amp;J AZ. Bring AZ doses Mexico! Yeah supposed locked two weeks, yet are. I'll believe see it. Said masks sick people, guess forgot simple mind article says owner glad put employees danger, probably vaccinated yet. know details, pretty short article meant make reactionaries mad. goddammit downvote, disagree you. really ""appropriate precautions"" protect oneself this. got sick despite following rules wearing properly fitted n95 grocery store. I'm 35, BMI 20, pre-existing health conditions would considered high risk COVID complications: heart problems. 35. people giving fuck, worse rest us suffer it.


Sorry, government failed us things properly. held accountable. Also, I'm personally fine people coughing public transit -- think standard procedure wear mask protect others need go public cold. felt way long COVID thing.   live Michigan got scheduled get first vaccine shot. thing health insurance kicked yet since started new job. place I'm getting shot, branch University Michigan, says charge fee administering I've read CDC site says can't. missing something? think means I'm fatigued dumbass talking every three seconds.  sign it? expect provide exact predictions?

Anyway, ""cat 5 hurricane"" analogy rest world. concern US could soon follow, extent.

Just read article. don‚Äôt see anywhere article says unions trying delay reopening. please point right direction? Cool.

Won't see there. Fake data   CDC's pandemic guidelines 2019 recommended lockdowns used...

The UK strictest COVID polices planet. one worst deaths per capita.

Peru also one strictest lockdowns. one hardest hit countries South America.

Germany much strict lockdown measures US yet they're deaths per capita second wave close US's. They're case curve per capita almost perfectly correlates US.

California one strictest lockdowns US. deaths per capita Florida Texas. Florida almost completely open since August. also fared much better California winter season.

There little correlation NPIs deaths per capita cases per capita.

It's like people anchored news coming March April 2020. thought talking fall 3 lockdowns wearing 5 masks till 2033 üò≠ ""this somehow bad""

-this sub join reddit talk Covid something? post history is.. sus.   Yeah, young people high risk. I'm definitely going get vaccine May earliest, think June reasonable expectation. want life happen again, last year counting.

We've got Doug Ford sitting million vaccine doses refusing hand helps re-election year say Federal Government given enough vaccine. wrong. know much cases rise, rising. odds he's predicted all. Hopefully eligibility expands 20yos, surge plateau soon decline quickly Monday, Johnson reassure people passports used public transport essential shops.  lot ""children spread virus much"" theories revolved around idea children's bodies might react differently virus.


I thought also much fact children known pretty dirty (like putting everything mouth, playing dirt, washing hands, touching sneezing coughing everywhere. figured age start considering ""kids"" instead ""children"" (super subjective, imaginary, know, lol) roughly age start making active effort towards cleanliness... make case 50 states areas citizens saying ""fuck it"".

I can't speak privacy laws Colorado specifically, know nothing federally would come anywhere near close prohibiting this. 

I'm saying challenge, perhaps ADA, call gray area. Many businesses already require flu vaccines employees contractors, already case law legitimizing mandatory vaccination. Bruh what? vaccines aren‚Äôt sterilizing people they‚Äôre safe would happy know sitting next movie theatre going breathe Covid face.

COVID-19 actually fairly mild compared past pandemics. Stop dense.

You're arguing people FLED California? delusional? People fleeing poorly run state since start. Colorado flooded them. actually gives CA advantage...

Explain correlation strict NPIs deaths per capita, data suggests. Explain per capita case curves look nearly identical comparing US Germany different regions US. Explain TX FL actually fared much better CA heavy lockdown states. Explain UK Peru bad yet strictest NPIs. Peru actually head start southern hemisphere cases start exploding winter.

Australia NZ sparsely populated islands. APAC countries actually fared extremely well regardless NPIs. Seems like pre existing immunity SARS1 similar coronavirus. Probably partially genetic well (can see US data too).

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* 100% agreed lecture format. said that, think must outlier here. son full distance learning decided pull daughter elementary school home school year auditing distance class last spring (it pretty awful). perfect, really well. daughter gets lessons 5-6 hours time simply read pleasure. first year really enjoyed reading become ravenous books (She finished Harry Potter series reading Hobbit moving Frank Herbert Neil Stephenson). reading level improved much vs previous years we're frankly little worried sending back. son tougher time missing friends, academically he's actually improved vs previous years. sit use resources like Khan Academy supplement (sometimes insufficient) school resources reteach things he's picking lecture format.

I think distance learning really highlighted chasm training organization different teachers (and age necessarily correlate). figured ways work kids, keep engaged small groups actively participate class.  know exactly expect every week post assignments grades promptly using school's preferred online tools. Others completely disorganized, idea use school's electronic resources, lack even basic communication skills. spend entire hour talking kids, use bizarre non-deterministic folder organization scheme posting assignments (that course can't properly tracked using school's online tools), seemingly randomly change rules week week hoping something gets kids start paying attention them.

I wish would willing adopt techniques Finnish use schools. anything, past year really made question whether whole system education needs complete overhaul. say NYC schools, private schools too? NYC public schools? getting from? I'm aware major concern pretty much anyone. virus always ""affected"" younger population, need change all. Young people hugely fueled every single surge virus far. They're dying much, they've getting infected massive rate along. genuine say weeks though. 10 weeks this. Everyone free see best kids. Nobody forced keep kids home however teachers vaccinated case here. Umm, young people never resistant infected. You‚Äôre absolutely right. experience comes wife middle school teacher. parents asking they‚Äôre kids could improve grades get help - specific times set communicated kids work 1 1. 9 times 10, none showed up. many kids treated remote days (they 2 days person, 3 remote week) days didn‚Äôt work. many kids flat didn‚Äôt turn work. Well hopefully vaccine rollout changes! understand point union best interest teachers.. hope interest kids accounted well. mean aren‚Äôt many articles like evidence super dangerous teachers open. lived large ISD well hasn‚Äôt come fruition here. I‚Äôm getting vaccine still incredibly uncomfortable prospect needing show medical history get beer see movie. That‚Äôs normal can‚Äôt believe goal posts moved far even debate. sounds like miserable existence. Get help dude. quite, mostly. 

I think wearing masks significant effect majority people outside healthcare get good masks even lab (read: perfect) conditions masks around 50-70% effective, seen many people wear improperly-fitted masks wear improperly general? know many forget wash hands touch eyes, nose, ears? Even biggest germaphobe know taking dead serious trouble remembering adjust mask touch face even year restrictions. They're generally useful, think masks helped general populace much. 

This could've handled, lockdowns mask mandates, prepared. simply weren't. Plenty countries handled quickly efficiently without mask mandates prepared it. People still wore masks, encouraged, mandated (which probably people listened, that's speculation). Thanks sharing info!

‚ÄúUp 20%‚Äù seems way low. thoughts number?  Ive heard before. Didnt happen. Why? I'm gonna ask 7 million get shots.  number deaths, pattern: excess deaths highly concentrated specific times.

As see graphs, brief periods number excess deaths went like crazy, correspond exactly periods high numbers people testing positive virus. rest year deaths higher usual.

I'm expert workings South African healthcare system, massively higher number TB deaths due coronavirus testing taking away resources TB testing, expect deaths least little bit spread out? would still significant amount testing even cases lower.

Did people die TB year? Maybe. looks lot like covid main cause excess death.  downvoted? right. entire educational system broken tax collection scheme education incentivized splitting wealthy impoverished other. school shouldn‚Äôt funded hyper local taxes.  Actually, might help get vaccines religious fanatics. okay Depends look it, happy get vaccine control all. 

It would control refuse / can't vaccinate Cope american heres actual proposal: id laws, universal mail-in voting forever, vax stations polling stations mandatory. solves everything imo idea many tens billions spent research areas?

Or money spent vaccine research (specifically mRNA) moved space 10 years earlier already working HIV, cancer, using said mRNA technology?

COVID-19 research akin space race - moved many parts medical reserach forward.

I never understood people understanding something works always strong opinions.  Damn George Soros! Mere months ago claiming wouldn‚Äôt period. 

But I‚Äôm sure goal posts wouldn‚Äôt moved yet again. I'm Easter Sunday. interns write articles. casual link deserves investigated recipients make informed decision. That's incredibly terrible idea multiple reasons. much better solution would keep early mail-in voting least years minimize lines polling places. Control. ones city fighting person.  teachers get vaccine, think backed down.  hybrid public schools, 100% person. true *HIPAA* speak this, business demanding protected health information pre-requisite business pretty big grey area significant privacy concern. attempt verify person's vaccine status, say, suspected 'vaccine passport' faked, 100% illegal.

Moreover, things like CDC's vaccine card includes sorts PHI completely unnecessary give place buisness. feel charge? ‚ÄúGosh can‚Äôt believe people care _freedumbs_ much don‚Äôt want upload entire medical history equifax granted access chipotle. Americans selfish hate grandma.‚Äù lol seem pretty related me. like said im advocating it, would good way convince people throw away stupid id laws funny first vaccine got moderna guy practically jammed arm.

They've also stayed around 2-5% New York % people vaccinated, 1st 2nd doses.

This receiving around distribution per capita New York. They're well supply vaccines have. Yes. can't answer course. hope got needed clarity least catharsis typing out.

This extremely gray. think wrong answer here. weeks make break daughter's future. weeks second vaccine also probably make break yours, know condition. FWIW, single dose vaccine provides 80% efficacy, again, know holds condition. cancer take serious immunosuppressants, definitely wait weeks get second dose.

I think already taken important step daughter, recognizing slipped areas. I'm worried kids like daughter, kids like daughter concerned parents get active get caught summer things start go back normal. tons kids parents can't help kids recognize need help. kids really need school open now.

Like said, think there's wrong answer. long keep following social distancing guidelines next weeks, *definitely* see side this, long stay concerned active parent (which I'm sure will), daughter make fine.

Good luck. I'm sure look back year even months much better place. anyone country vote? 32*

As politics, we've clear difference political parties response historic health crisis. Desantis subtle approach prefers. US: open schools leggo kids cant get it

Me: thats works

US: good chilll ^(its spiking varient lol jk) 100%. European governments atrocious job pulling vaccine bet anti vaxxers waiting caves spread ton crap it.

No way FDA gives EUA News reports requiring vaccination public gatherings etc. suggest framed requiring vaccination, small print ""vaccination proof natural immunity test showing covid"". going anything fig leaf, people need practical way take test.

NOW many last year's users left sub behind. either due pandemic fatigue, they've gotten vaxxed &amp; think over, maybe little both. 

so rather fewer people around downvote talk skeptics. straight attrition Oh. Wow. really stings. ever recover something damaging talking ‚Äòadult‚Äô? Well, guess internet me.  like def exercise changed rules ADA people pre-existing conditions get healthcare.  difference denying service/employment health history. might leniency vaccine checks service/employment right now, way stand court long term, unless government provides exception it. Based what, pseudo-type virus applications computer modeling? Need let real world 'wild type' challenges play out. data far suggests vaccines still prevent hospitalizations deaths almost 100%. that's matters. headlines maddening.... Vaccine bottle half empty Fauci: 4th wave     
Media: 4th wave severe symptoms right? point stage brother dropped dead 28 five years ago. I‚Äôm aware death happen anyone. takes one person. Bummed cautious folks Michigan (and elsewhere) may contract anyway others celebrating rounding third ball still play. That's ridiculous. emergency authorization. test safe effective. polio Vax emergency vaccinations go. want wait three years approving it? thanks. Vaccine science come incredibly far.

I'm guessing front line next year gets official fda super approval. hope stick. asthma got really bad hit puberty, combined kids class also hitting puberty discovering wonders Axe, missed days 6th grade attended. Virtual school would left whole lot healthier better educated, even went virtually bad asthma days. wasn‚Äôt possible days dial up, infrastructure place kids person online. can‚Äôt continue use kids sick (seriously ill, like cold three days)? There's still least 100M US vaccinated. What's funny again? amount fear mongering title ridiculous. Man imagine even asking 7 year old, much less trying convince them. World's worst guy.....yet people like worst worst scary. literally millions us *able* vaccinated aren‚Äôt eligible yet.  require vaccine passports flu enter movie theatre travel?

if flu killed half million Americans last year, might realize adolescents mean kids 12 up. Almost everyone started puberty 12. 12 study lot longer. Everyone still human. much variation immune systems 6 months.  that? difference 20 21 days meaningless.

The reason schedule things ‚Äúweeks‚Äù presumably match periodicity individual schedules lifestyles. seem unaware there's different kinds blood clots first place. caused these. seem uninformed. Yet seem hinder ascertaining everyone disagrees anti-vax basically stupid.

 small amount people truly gonna make ton people die that. personally think idea forcing people show vaccinated anything honestly horrible idea. Maybe short term also guys let's Remember also say things short term never stop. 2 weeks turned year still know things normal. still saying need social distance mask fully vaccinated even telling us change. Instead talking vaccine passports. dont understand one else getting wierded this. getting idea things return normal experts said much. uncomfortable prospect needing show medical history

It's medical history; ""did get vaxxed nah"". which, getting vaxxed, going pass anyway Sounds like won‚Äôt happy everyone dies. course benefits far outweigh risk UK went 1200~ deaths per day 3 months ago day, today 40~ deaths per day would criminal stop vaccinating point 7 blood clot deaths there's still concrete proof 37 million doses administered What's anti-vaxx this? consider governments Norway, Germany, France, Netherlands, Denmark etc anti-vaxxers, too? Let's prohibit them?

You can't shout ""the benefits outweigh risks"" clear certain age group. Specifically Norway cluster showed young healthy women, case. deaths due reaction that's likely explained taking vaccine Covid itself. 

That risk-benefit analysis makes suitable for, data rn, younger women. 

Is anti-vaxx? Go on, tell me. 

Or stance individual risk-benefit analysis moot spirit solidarity older groups? I'd posit least warrants discussion ethics. Wtf B117? can‚Äôt keep anymore. common sense outlook situation. got second shot past Thursday. way masking permanent United States. remember Fauci saying would get rid handshake makes sense spreading germs also absurd notion well.

That's even addressing low platelet levels clotting problems happening alongside this. exact numbers rarity happening time, I'm guessing exactly common. 

As three day ago, roughly [31 million people received least one dose vaccine. Statistically, 1 2 people died randomly CVST based numbers alone. instead 1 2 people, 7 died total [22 identified cases received AZ vaccine. 

I'm saying AZ vaccine definitely causing it. I'm saying numbers high far norm, certainly worth looking deeply into. say pure chance related going create mistrust...Similar CDC said masks help mast March.

My numbers could off. I'm going news sources say. I'm anti_vaxxer. fully believe vaccines Im fully vaccinated Covid-19 (Pfizer.) believe anti-vaxxers idiots causing WAY much harm society.

You‚Äôre stinking cute. thanks. There's also sizable portion natural immunity already it.  3 week quarantine. Everyone stays home. Virus gone. Many countries eradicated thru good quarantine practices. Countrys can't keep shit control travel trade blocked get shit together.  Someone infected months year ago would 0.8 antibodies. 22 antibodies. big number! got second shot yesterday, far nothing except sore shoulder also thought heard ducks coming bathroom sink realized that's everyday occurrence waited line went vote. voting center large building surrounded dozens people. wouldn‚Äôt call largely individual you‚Äôre going person. Funny used North America Canada. nothing new article that's point exactly. lean company AZ Duh Every study we've done shows increase severity across ages vaccinated. None studies consistent affect IFR younger people?

B.1.1.7 countries dealing number something like +50%. still really small (but negligible compared normal death rate) number. Agreed. think vaccine passports bad idea everyday things like bars, stores, events, etc... fantastic idea things already use vaccination status (e.g. employment, school, travel, etc...). give everyone chance get vaxxed gotta move on. It'll enough slow spread trickle (and areas high anti-vaxxer populations high immunity anyway). could convinced otherwise great argument. heard one yet.

We another 2 months everyone access COVID vaccines. Maybe 3 months think exceptional circumstances.

We're introducing new precedent discrimination (and disclosure medical information) venues never 2 months relative safety small portion people areas. juice worth squeeze.

People say slippery slope argument, even immediate ramifications. also *is* also slippery slope. first health issue break almost entirely along income, educational, racial lines.

I think lot people think anti-vaxxers universally 55 year old Karens drive Range Rovers spend much time Facebook, likely poor black people uneducated white people who, everything unchanged, would probably get vaccinated heartbeat different upbringing better schooling.

Now, let's real acknowledge vaccine requirements play huge part getting general compliance, use them, let's also recognize requirements schools, workplaces, travel good enough, already decent oversight/infrastructure comes privacy preventing discrimination. *need* drag every aspect lives, shouldn't. offer real, tangible payoff already get means, creates environment widespread ostracization certain groups people extremely easy.

2. Booger Wipers. name it, I‚Äôve seen kid wipe booger it. Rug? Yes. Neighbor‚Äôs shoe? Yup. Desk? Easy. smartboard? Unfortunately, yes. ZERO shame.

3. Number times kid sneezed eyeball mid-sentence: Somewhere 6 8. 

4. Percent sneezes ATTEMPTED covered: 17.4

5. Percent kids never saw anything disgusting year: 0

Yes. kids awesome/cute, etc. they‚Äôre gross. It‚Äôs fault, it‚Äôs way small humans are. 

And did‚Äôt sign mediocre pay life die it. Yes, they‚Äôre suffering socially. It‚Äôs PANDEMIC. Stop pressuring teachers risk lives this. It‚Äôs responsibility. became minute signed parenthood, parents! it‚Äôs ok bear guilt! It‚Äôs PANDEMIC. Shit happens, move on. kids fine, ALIVE. Go lawyer/notary (or professional law allows it) get ‚Äúcertified true copies‚Äù. 

Never lose original copy used legally. Idk you‚Äôre downvoted, variants proven significantly infectious Awesome! I'm going enjoy watching redditors explain he's wrong know better. I'm sorry, that's happening. British variant spread easily, kids risk were. Herd immunity Fall, even kids spread it, much spread.

Flu mutates way worse often. We've never kept kids home prevent that.

Mutations often make disease mild. keep kids home they're super safe bad stuff there, unless something unforeseeable happens, we're going fine. exactly backwards. 

Because groups *aren't* constitutionally protected, state pass statute regulating them

""Constitutionally protected"" means protected constitution. protects state laws. 

People prefer walk barefoot shirtless constitutionally protected, legal states prohibit restaurants serving people wearing shirts shoes.

Race constitutionally protected class, legal state pass law prohibiting serving Asians, Whites, Blacks. 

Being unvaccinated like barefoot. like Black. God forbid parents want protect kids potential lifelong consequences Covid guilt spreading someone vulnerable. even catch vaccinated, outcome lot less severe. think many studies done pharma companies also Israel actually showed 100% reduction death, i.e. deaths virus among vaccinated.

So virus can't kill you. still going remain locked down, avoid travel, wear mask, socially distance keep kids schools? People lost minds. *seen* Michigan's numbers?  Oh god stop responding, liar. obsessed. think theres medication that. monologues always amazing. downvote man making simple mistake, correct him. dental office I‚Äôve seen taking lots extra precautions transmission within dental offices extremely low.

Yeah went dentist first time weeks ago honestly excellent experience terms pandemic safety.

* obviously everyone wearing masks
* much ensure good ventilation
* bunch air purifiers everywhere
* people wait/fill forms cars
* least dentist/his assistant vaccinated (didn't talk anyone else)

I'm glad it. Dental health vastly underrated/overlooked component overall health. People like lead shut-in lifestyles... would guessed?? better harder lockdowns contact tracing shorter time effective suppression rather unnecessarily extending pandemic going lockdowns every months. Better keep schools shut. Probably safe open fall 2022, but, course, depends. Yeah effect protected class. different said? big problem see virtual learning expensive. tech, personnel.

Young children learn lectures. learn doing. do, need monitoring constant feedback. One teacher classroom engage kids teacher zoom. get enough feedback little rectangle. relying kids raising hands/giving feedback, puts ones introverted, less vocal, etc. huge disadvantage.

When developing virtual classes back day, discovered needed roughly 2x many instructors. One lecture, another watch students make sure understood going on. Moreover, cap size online classes 15 so, whereas person version 25. graduate school motivated students. kid's elementary school private school; online classes got broken groups small 4-5 depending what's covered. Instead 2 teachers per classroom, school 3. fine shot according CDC understand offended though?

I not. problem comparing ateocities Soviet Union government trying protect us deadly dangerous pandemic. two things extremely different comparing makes seem like Soviet Union nothing big.

No, vaccination passports principle becoming similar Soviet Union did. Get idiotic conspiracies head say was. claimed vaccinated people allowed stop distancing pointed that's necessarily true. There's certain category people that, long, want hear optimism, literally addicted type reporting. justifies approach surviving pandemic, listen take gospel anything validates lived lives past 13 months. That's 75% adults vaccinated mRNA, without new strains, first weeks vaccination.

To 2019 back, neutralization titers must kept high level, leaders need push people get vaccinated like Israel.

A country lacking social unity weak leaders, lots antivaxers Querdenker, low-effectiveness vaccines, non-mandatory rapid testing failed update campaign new normal. Yesterday states third highest amount new daily cases ever 9200. responsible nearly one-seventh country's new daily cases. How's actual numbers? Look Google covid case chart. Texas, like states, goes midweek back weekend. Last week midweek rise noticeable. bar. They're already *legally required law* make show government issued ID purchase goods. think bar choosing documentation vaccination start papers please? I‚Äôm still amazed mom didn‚Äôt make get vaccine summer freshman year. retrospect, unlike her. can‚Äôt see facts quoted post. Well he's exactly wrong Non-vaccinated people protected. 

Which show proof measles vaccine play sports go school. 

It‚Äôs settled law, change would mean deal outbreaks closing economies. Oh no, screenshot. guy nothing grossly overpaid government turd. He's much doctor Jill Biden. Like Howie Carrs says: ""He's like Marcus Welby MD. He's real doctor plays one TV"". brought sponsors Shit risk factors family, though we're quite ""medically fragile"" category. article address OP posted: drastically increased child infectivity double risk severe disease. That, along fact every infection opportunity mutation means would selfish irresponsible allow children put lives others risk well. ones actually stopping spread Covid.

If asymptomatic spreader, rolling around mask won‚Äôt prevent spread. Oh no, screenshot. really nothing better do. Guess report harassment stalking.  got shot everyone know got one, asked government ID confirm appointment. Nobody know asked questions citizenships, residency, etc. ID. tourist probably foreign passport sure would work not. could call around places find out. Oh no, screenshot. really nothing better do. Guess report harassment stalking. Looks like you‚Äôll abandon 30 day account create new one. Israel let people travel kilometer residence months, allowed dine-in eating all, still really opened schools gonna try apply data U.S.

lol lmao thought meant post-covid fatigue. excited vent mine, oh well. Either way let tell contracted covid: never fatigued mentally unwell life. Sure sickness sucked, part worst. contracted almost month ago. Please continue stay safe avoid illness. truly awful. Nope. clear Feb masks critical thought nuts anyone argue otherwise. needed supply non-medical masks instructions make cloth masks. Wow, sub basically useless now. teeth cleaning Thursday say bit ‚Äúrelaxed‚Äù, actually kind nice. hygienist usual PPE (gown, surgical mask, gloves) face shield goggles gone. asked she‚Äôs fully vaccinated said ‚Äúabsolutely!‚Äù. 

For minutes, life felt normal....even something routine teeth cleaning.  taken seriously practically every single person part stop every single day. Young lives matter, too. Everyone owes youth large debt. understand offended though? Surely, anything, see slow encroachment human rights we're witnessing worldwide, equally concerned, knowing people capable of. may yet, principles becoming similar day. realize thing maims lot people die it, right? focusing deaths accepting 60-70k cases day insane know damage caused people part statistic like deaths. I'm hopeful like everyone else vaccination program really well done let's forget deaths. wonder information this. researching kids got infected first wave perform today? know vaguely long covid looks adults, could investigate well kids past infections performing right now. There's little detail example reported months ago DPA used Corning could produce glass vials contain vaccine - may remember reports early shortage vials. 

ISTR something like $300 million involved, likely major undertaking. surprising can‚Äôt give 50 people HIV once. It‚Äôs airborne.

It‚Äôs silly argument. compare apples apples ‚Äî- like airborne disease killed half million people. examples that? 2020 life expectancy dropped year. vaccines protective everyone 12 choose vaccinated September. point, enough virus around children younger asymptomaticly spread.

There may masks school closed week there, US winning war. think still ramping up. Production Pfizer Moderna reportedly doubled couple weeks ago J&amp;J still trying ramp up. not. surveillance test November January **no one school.**  go another university probably end thing yeah, kind impact get anyway.
Stop projecting. Wisconsin, one normal states, least normal county.

There's almost nothing DO. many people still afraid human contact closeness, something inside mask actually depressing nothing all. reason believe fake actually, quite bad.

They huge underestimates though. Russia‚Äôs excess deaths year among worst world yet per capita civic deaths quite low. He‚Äôll healthy game two, get broken likely retire, suspect. Dobby going get snagged utter bullshit expansion lottery ticket. We‚Äôll end starting next season Otter one kids AHL team. 

Unless start playing well enough make last playoff spot soon, they‚Äôd smart let Bish, Seguin, Rads, Roope rest walking wounded take rest season get back 100% rather rush back. know ins outs, daughter's daycare, 5 teachers, 5 kids, 3 parents kids got it. one (health dept included) could determine came from. One kids included that. still said spread within daycare cause. dunno none people involved trace cases besides daycare, yet ""it daycare"". employed Mexican Fortune 500 1 year stint absolutely expat. Texas opened 3 weeks ago mask mandate. lowest weekly average cases since last June.

People really starting get sick fear mongering. is? Actually, preventing spread certain degree could almost important vaccination. 

Lowering number person person transmissions reduces number chances mutations.

The mutations, higher risk mutation lowers effective vaccines. mean risk stating obvious, masks cases directly correlated people want think. Increasing mask wearing always reduce cases, decreasing mask wearing always increase cases. simple. California implemented restrictions many considered draconian late late year cases skyrocketed. Meanwhile see opposite Texas. studies shown thing -- relationship states / localities / countries imposing restrictions actual outcomes simple cause effect. Pandemics like boat, holes third world countries sink everyone. Even rich. States protect classes people aren‚Äôt federally protected time. example, Michigan added protected class status height weight, neither federally protected. Even municipalities create protected classes. can‚Äôt override federal government remove protected classes, always add. intrastate commerce, would absolutely nothing constitutionally preventing adding vaccination status protected class everybody wants vaccine gets one, I'll happy let people rely faith. EsCaPe MuTaNtS! I‚Äôve never masked flu. It‚Äôs also less dangerous covid, even children. According CDC, 2019-2020 flu season set record flu deaths children U.S. 188 children died. recent numbers could find covid February. then, 241 children US died covid. that‚Äôs even distancing masks place. no, flu dangerous children. I‚Äôm advocating school closures long term distancing anything. masks go normal activity, seems like really small thing ask exchange protecting kids. apply here. Nothing wrong noting important national issue, even better alternative. ridiculous. need update scientific understanding. Antibodies last least year. vaccine induced antibodies last least 6 months. Antibodies also part immune system fights virus. Partial herd immunity already happened parts world like Israel. Scarred limited access mental health care. future grim ever. Sounds like can‚Äôt read. one ever stopped traveling even height pandemic. However director CDC says even fully vaccinated says ‚Äúimpending doom‚Äùyou wonder why? tend rely posts kind reliable source linked. show school data tracking hard numbers want. Benchmark schools? School grades? hard data 650 kids would like? Beyond ""my kid level imo"" need policy general explain vaccinated life return back go normal let get straight, President United States, took production facility PRIVATE company called ""Emergent"" mistake, gave responsibility factory J&amp;J completely sidelined production another vaccine producer (AZ).

Not exactly. 

By regulation, facilities like usually permitted produce two vaccines one facility. HHS - relevant agency - discretion waive regulation. 

After provisionally allowing joint production, decided waive regulation.

The Emergent facility yet approved produce vaccine. Due Emergent's repeated poor performance, government decided approve Emergent-run facility. 

It's really simple that. Emergent owns facility (I'm sure do; may staff), either continue occupy nothing, lease J&amp;J least make money. 

But one **taking** anything anyone. guys still way behind us deaths per capita something pround of.

It's drawn war, single battle. Right US winning battle rapid vaccine rollout already taken massive losses half million deaths. Nah millions people likely immune exposed virus. estimated 30% end January, 40% end February. probably slowing cases slowed add vaccinated percentage. true. According CDC, 2019-2020 flu season set record flu deaths children U.S. 188 children died. recent numbers could find covid February. then, 241 children US died covid. that‚Äôs even distancing masks place. no, flu dangerous children. fact covid less dangerous children elderly mean it‚Äôs worth considering. think continuing close schools, see friends, etc next school year probably far - costs would outweigh benefits. considering wearing mask going normal activity really small burden, seems well worth protect children. Seems like you‚Äôre concern trolling. one stopping traveling within US. Practically every state relaxed restrictions. CDC clear past weeks vaccinated people meet without masks distancing. plethora causes death far exceed COVID deaths never taken seriously this

Uhh maybe 3, 4 max, taken *very* seriously. we've somewhat blessed insanely effective mRNA vaccines (and even viral vector-based vaccines pretty effective too), concerning line thinking I'm seeing around more.

Vaccines definitely personally protective, require herd immunity fully protective. Despite headlines rushing say vaccines fully protective hospitalization death, reality not. Small sample sizes at-risk groups trials led low hospitalizations even placebo groups (most trials well 10 hospitalizations) confidence intervals hospitalization wide. Moderna even two hospitalizations trial group (but reason believe Moderna less effective Pfizer - bad luck). Real world protection hospitalization death mRNA vaccines range somewhere 87% 98% depending studies looking 

Any place COVID spreading endemically, I'd rather go somewhere know everyone vaccinated. furthers personal protection vaccine community protection. Plus, anything encourages anti-vaxxers stop selfish right thing win book. takes end endemic spread deadly virus US take simple shot they're unwilling weird combination ignorance self-righteous selfishness. 


\* 97% data actually example community protection. hard read underlying study Hewbrew (which linked news article), issue study vaccinated population seeing higher effectiveness community protection. got vaccine likely hang around vaccinated individuals, whereas unvaccinated individuals likely hang around unvaccinated ones (e.g., ultra-orthodox populations). artificially increases apparent effectiveness vaccinated unvaccinated groups major risk exposure differences cannot easily controlled for. vaccine protects you, protect unvaccinated. virus (clothes, body, face, etc) traveling still spread Covid others. 

But part protected. That's safe travel, recommended safety others. Thats take it. dont mind asking? I'm wayy careful probably need whole thing (especially I've vaccinated), yeah like said, people back normal since November last year, last time severe outbreak. Besides limiting attendance big sporting events businesses still asking people wear mask, majority people around going life normal, months. people around dont even talk Covid much anymore unless vaccine.

Are still forced stay home are? feel like cant leave house?

And get depression, I've definitely felt like I've losing mind times, point sitting damn house time world passing by. yeah, news come recently pretty positive that's think we're pretty close end. dont think people going stay cooped summer all. long hospitalizations deaths going everything changing, like said, I'm people barely pay attention Covid anymore.

Anyway, hard feelings anything wish well, think everything lot better lot sooner people think, especially since many places they've essentially back normal awhile. Ooooooo I'm soooooo scaaaaaared definitely is. people close social circle steadily getting first second doses Pfizer last month place. 

My pretty much zero side effects both. One friend brain frog bad fatigue couple days first, another horrible flu like symptoms day second dose, another stomach issues diarrhea day first; headache mild fatigue maybe 12 hours first another totally fine first.

Only thing common sore stiff arm.  Video chats make infinitely socially anxious seeing people real life. don‚Äôt Category 5 hurricane Canada? submitted data fda. Since adolescents similar adults, approved next weeks. reason can't promise let adolescents get vaccinated adults want vaccine almost gotten it. That's That's fuzzy metric, flood vaccines coming in, long. current vaccines like Pfizer moderna good enough keep B117 away? parents constantly exposed grandkids around 2-6 years old. parents vaccinated. still worry? happened baseball game analogy? What? said still get infected start. surprise  experts saying studies specifically studied whether someone vaccinated still spread virus. studied whether people get sick vaccinated slightly different question.

I one ""experts"" really agree mounting evidence, example [Israeli studies find Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine reduces [Can vaccinated person still spread coronavirus? HEALTH AFFAIRS: Several Israeli research teams getting ‚Äòvery promising‚Äô results answer half dozen articles studies Google up.

But whatever unknown reason studies satisfying Fauci, CDC talking heads say anything basically remain masked, lockdown, avoid travel, etc. basically indefinitely. guess see studies whatever find convincing.

I personally think BS friends family agree. people vaccinated going back normal life. vaccinated 80-somethig in-laws came visit, another couple coming couple weeks. Another couple friends NYC (both vaccinated) coming between.

I understand ""experts"" ""abundance caution"" think rapidly losing credibility nobody wants deal lockdowns more. Man, houston here, got email Sat eligible dentist sign up, appt. tuesday, day eligible. 

I thought would june time got mine. I've like 10 dentist appointments since pandemic began. Mostly follow ups invisalign, two cleanings, one root canal. adverse affects. Good hear scheduling tomorrow. First dose done, second dose scheduled I‚Äôm waiting baseball tickets go sale middle May finally catch game. might lick doorknob I‚Äôm ballpark drinking overpriced beer eating enough shitty $1 hot dogs make sick Got second dose Pfizer yesterday, last night hit like mac truck, arm hurt like hell, pain spread back 12 hours, nothing, feeling fine. wife hand reaction. totally worth happy. Still masking feeling much better future. anyone help make sense antibody test took? took beckman's IgG antibody test spike protein COVID19. upper limit normal test 0.79, anything considered positive. tested 22. 35 days second dose pfizer vaccine. good response? ask got second pfizer dose 20th day first, instead 21, I've nervous correctly. significant OCD anxiety, I've trying gain mental benefits vaccine. first dose second (Moderna) cause someone test negative despite symptoms continual close exposure positive-testing individuals? know far transmissibility? Newish sub, voted saying fuck rona? rona sympathisers missing subtext. Sorry üò¨

Face shields scrub caps permanent staple dental attire. I‚Äôm honestly pretty grossed didn‚Äôt wear beforehand. vaccines going fairly quickly memorial day looking good. everyone wants open today everyone chance food vaccination going extra cases hopefully less severe older shots. say, CDC.

I point make here, I'm anti-mask weirdo, strong feelings whether infants wear masks, reasons shouldn't. I'm simply fact-checking specific claim made getting upvoted. claim was, AFAICT, false. It‚Äôs also country restrictions Told y‚Äôall *that* good logistic  Casually sexist, nice bud Remember next time get rid Trudeau. Spineless wimp worried globalist looking woke screwed playing stupid games 

""Canada believes strong coordinated response across world across sectors essential,"" said. ""This pandemic provided opportunity reset. chance accelerate pre-pandemic efforts reimagine economic systems actually address global challenges like extreme poverty, inequality climate change.‚Äù No. population vaccinated won‚Äôt matter virus spreading. Yes, notoriously selective...Cleveland State University. Lol  seem thinking part huge group people massive inconveniences masks. not. 

How know special? Perhaps, you? Metabolic rates different.
Also, enjoyment/education: lookup amounts moisture humans exhale: enormous, I'm seeing estimates 20-40g/hour REST, e.g rising even moderate levels activity. moisture end up? (this breathing moisture counting sweat)



 greatest mask world, fitted properly it'll worse normal store bought mask well fitted.

Better fit almost certainly make moisture issues worse. fact, perhaps vast majority ""have problems"" wearing masks wear masks without problem.

How know know problems? opposed complaining them?
Everyone talked even moderate exercise mask says thing: get wet.

And clearly, common issue, sudden urges worship devil purchase large sums microsoft products? radiating 5g waves? I'd assume meant 4 million per day average. average 3.08M per day past week. Wrong exactly? GLOBAL it‚Äôs going take time vaccinate ENTIRE WORLD Silver lining goatfuck hopefully least kind reduction working sick. I‚Äôm naive enough think it‚Äôll go away completely industries I‚Äôll happy becomes less normal. losing fucking mind kid nonsense ever since whole shitshow started. Kids nothing running petri dishes screaming, spitting, touching licking everything. Make wear fucking mask. give shit want to. force wear pair fucking pants, force wear mask. ask anyone parent, going one, fucking parenting job includes masking crotch goblin, period. game changer need test every wedding attend work wedding industry.. Honestly? Fauci idiots pushing extremely inconsistent messaging go fuck themselves.

After I'm fully vaccinated + two weeks. I'm completely done giving shit virus I'm going resume living life normally. 

If rest want keep watching variant fear porn want keep living like this, go ahead, without me.

I'll Dallas, Austin, Nashville whatever fucking city fully open point. Many states Vaccines open general public States. Canada isn‚Äôt quite yet. believe Vegas‚Äôs team almost completed vaccinated. make difference Also Canucks got nasty strain mess. Anal swabs OLD normal Jersey understand ;) We're 90% category that's tax payers operate. work 90% waste time. Except South High School football. tax payers cough money new stadium. Otherwise, good luck raising taxes order figure create virtual school would require fundamental redesign curriculum retraining staff. Without masks social distancing, Rt Covid-19 varies 2,5 4 estimates. 

That means 25% 40% susceptible individuals population avoid exponential growth. 

Since large part population cannot get vaccinated right (those 16yo make 20% population), would need vaccines 75% 90% adults able offset exponential growth ability. 

So, best hopes time being, especially variant spreads 1,5 times easily, open economy still require social distancing masks pray enough. 

You check, Israel 90% non arab non orthodox vaccinated large proportions arabs orthodox already vaccinated... yet thinking requiring masks outside...

Have fun! really want hear ""it's kids problems"", right? Many states getting good declines right now. We‚Äôll see rest follow suit next weeks. May 1 we‚Äôll seeing solid declines nationwide. worry much, usually achey arm, low energy possibly muscle aches like 2 days tops. people administering give needed info put ease :) Holy shit, world get high school? seem nice. problems getting appointment, forget HCQ option. would expect institutions similar mandates. would hilarious also made get vaccinated get vote, im advocating would make people reconsider passing laws restricting voting rights Incivility tolerated. Bye.

The card reminder second dose. ike oil change sticker window. Ooooooooo sounds good right now. didn‚Äôt even realize open Easter... üòùmight dinner dessert thank you!  Go kick rocks Fauci. temp workers essential farming industry. food bigger issue little bit covid. get groceries. thoughts Les Wexner distribution network? daughter 13 says wants get it, certainly old enough involved decisions. However, hope studies address overall health vaccination bigger question parent. would think would obvious vaccine prevents covid kids. cause side effects issues kids? Since it‚Äôs low risk getting actual covid tend think cases going drop super low come end summer, I‚Äôm struggling comparative risks. not. go. CDC, Nationwide Children‚Äôs Hospital. going today, i'd assume bring card every time, literally held card i'd asked gave goods. write anything down. took less minute noticed standing line, pulled classic glazed right rollers still nice warm bit it! I‚Äôm tired old man loves cameras contradicts every time speaks. direct HCQ option vaccine only? way ‚Äúvast‚Äù majority vaccinated two months. live diluted reality. frankly still shouldn‚Äôt matter majority vaccine shouldn‚Äôt required anything it‚Äôs actually approved. People side argument love claim ones value science call everyone else ‚Äúfools‚Äù science FDA approval process? scientist developed process? Either believe science, case able respect anyone waiting approval hypocritical virtue signaling asshole Probably around 50% population see it. women Michigan doesn‚Äôt president scapegoat failures anymore Dunno make race. It‚Äôs basic human nature prominent thing (less rare), less esteemed seems. Nope, didnt show ID shot Russia using domestically, aren‚Äôt allowing individuals antibodies receive vaccine time due already antibodies. Babies doesn‚Äôt need socializing. There‚Äôs place bring babies apart doctors. 

So you‚Äôre right, doesn‚Äôt matter babies can‚Äôt wear masks, babies shouldn‚Äôt anywhere needs one. takes lot dedication mental focus sit recorded lecture knowing always watch later. also countless distractions get way. Speaking experience, sitting 2 3 hour online lectures last spring felt way mentally draining full day person classes lasting 6 hours.   relevant comment, thanks teaching nidus. like ""oh must mean nydus, like Starcraft"", find that's nydus comes from. 50 years, worked? toss terms like ""most"" implies numbers / engenders ideas people things like ""90% more"".

That's really accurate.

Regardless, entire point black white. really moving forward understanding different environments work better different kids different scenarios.

Teachers underpaid, class sizes large, kids struggle comingled educational setting. education system restructured play towards strengths various students achieve success possible. would mean ""one size fits approach"" anymore.

Your response couched though saying kids stay remote learning said nothing sort. Rapid test vaccine options. 10 year old. issue virtual learning kids particularly self-directed. takes lot parents monitor help. Unless every family kids someone home, going work. Well passports time limited. anything like regular ones, time expire longer relevant. Italy stopped AZ vaccine going Australia. France particular keeps threatening UK's second doses somewhat undiplomatically. UK usually reply. hi! question might sound pessimistic first promise it‚Äôs meant be, i‚Äôd like genuine answer. pretty wide rollout vaccine US right now, cases declining soon? basically expect noticeable difference then? shit. even testing kids. letting go school wondering parents grandparents ending hospital close contact anyone tested positive traveled. 

As much love science. consensus within community children risk stupid line put there. 

They major spreades beginning. covid someone else covid, coming contact worsen symptoms go it?  

""For example, vaccine starting initial efficacy 95% would expected maintain 

58% efficacy 250 days.""

Except - Pfizer data show 91% 180 days?   Well b assume massively populated country poor infrastructure keeping accurate count. UK US counted significantly first wave due poor testing left house year? Haven‚Äôt seen titanic? rich get life boats really good moving goal posts.

Teachers already underpaid normal school. class sizes large. 

That nothing discussion, clear zero intentions engaging genuinely.

Goodbye. use HCQ deal maddening scheduling. 6 months ago, suggested Govt. wanted introduce vaccine passports, invariably labelled ""CoNsPiRaCy ThEoRiSt"".

I'm certainly thrilled we're seeing uptick cases, macro scale still pretty limited. 25 times people received first dose vaccine last week tested positive. We're certainly woods yet, window sort rampant spread closing fast. ignored points post completely. Dodging question usually sign know wrong yet reluctant admit it. C'mon, join rest world better, democratic elections. We'd happy see it. Blaze bro would suggest all. Different people (for part) got two different variants.  full transcript available too. feel like people Paris couldn‚Äôt care less lockdown going business seeing friends congregating apartments I've done lot contracting work federal government, well state local government. I've gotten lot insight ""government level least"" answer definitely lack infrastructure. Sure infrastructure issue, capabilities, skill set, accountability, drive. massive red tape every decision, near impossible government something like this.

First, would it? CDC? Department Health Human Services? FDA? Could three, none. Neither really budget something like this. Even did, would put together? Anyone talent like working Google, Microsoft, start-up.

I guarantee nobody government gotten level shit putting something like out. Besides, someone it, great. OK, ... kind went away. really weird right? no, go away South Africa ""locked down."" lock down. see CBS doctored interview. Read full want prove fraud, it. otherwise proving anything No, doesn't. asking socialist Republicans believe something exactly prove anything.

You want get answer? There's subreddits that. full transcript also available.  Interesting see spike diabetes Alzheimer's deaths, wonder much explained COVID ravaging care homes. perfectly proves point Republicans nothing hypocrites. sure downvoted. 

Very stake virtual learning really liking it. think understand necessity right now, desire long-term. justifiably so. committing what's known roundtrip fallacy: confusing lack evidence evidence against. Fundamentally, way know much successful fraud been, definition successful fraud get caught / noticed. Personally, doubt super widespread, given elections (especially local/statewide) often decided double even single digits, still issue.

Even never substantial fraud thousands U.S. elections occurred country's history (which doubt), goal laws preventing fraud, accidents, disasters, etc. law place *before* issue happens. example, know hacking attempts 2016 election. someone said 2015 ""There's reason try make election system less vulnerable hacking never hacked,"" would agreed them? ü§£ü§™ü§† messing ya. Look forward transcript. CBS omitted bunch make look way. J&amp;J different type vaccine, important assume they'll effects. Plus, J&amp;J one shot, Pfizer Moderna two.

Right now, there's reason believe notable differences Pfizer Moderna vaccines. think got really lucky kindergartener. awesome minimal help us. Heh. mean really get science hard. vaccine 90% (NOT 100%) effective hard? Well know answer that. reread arguments lol. many states dont ridiculous id laws, yet next fraud cases. saying actual fraud cases reported? logic thats whats already happening Hawaii country. kinda thought Michael C. Hall _Dexter_ got little concerned. Let‚Äôs say AZ vaccination 1 2 million chance causing (yes causing) blood clots. People need grow stop pretending anything perfectly safe zero possible risk cost. vaccines metal particles them. what? amounts small carry known lifetime risk. What?

I'm saying absurd try claim Ron DeSantis ""the worst worst"". That's absolute Redditor-brain-worms level moment. I'm talking herd immunity here. talking beginning pandemic? much fraud system yielded? next none Well.

Depends location, really. ""better"" mean ""been sides issues point he's right,"" then, sure. country Hawaii? never said extremely rare youre putting words mouth. said care discuss rare irrelevant. dumb argument bleet ""there's much voter fraud anyways might well make super easy happen."" Whitmer already said going heighten restrictions again. plan ride out. 

They really need develop better process getting vaccinated Michigan. I've eligible months still can't secure appointment. far time consuming morning time break work, appointments booked. Thanks best luck kids. Millions people use Reddit, single hive mind. people feel strongly one topic, comment one, care, different group commenting. problem! honestly expect find it. many people private business requiring masks?

Well depends. talking herd immunity reached? case, see required. vast majority vaccinated, there's need them, require them? Genuinely curious here; way could set vaccine deliveries way census taken? would complications something like that? remember said this. Anyone called media?

No? Shocking. afaik. UK variant deadly preliminary data Brazil SA implies variants cause severe illness younger people too.

I'm sure variant they're struggling assume UK one UK India visa versa pretty common route due shared history/immigration. Kids spreading since day one refused acknowledge political pressure. good. üëç sounds pretty good evidenced by...?

(Are going cite HIPAA? Don‚Äôt cite HIPAA) I‚Äôd mask don‚Äôt want risk person still gets mild case despite vaccinated passes child.

Flu-pneumonia still kills kids covid despite existence vaccine it. chances you, vaccinated covid, passing virus small, still less lethal flu kids. also way less lethal kids normal amount riding car. Life numbers also CDC well AAP, idea point trying make there.

Your numbers normalized. comparing apples sort fruit, I'm going waste time figuring fruit is. know comparison apples still want know it‚Äôs huge deal people go normal business one small extra item clothing. big thing ask?

Why huge deal see people's faces, better understand speech, engage normal human interactions? teacher?

I can't speak Michigan seems like Gov Whitmer strict midwest states they've testing too.  

tldr: different stages Covid waves, slightly different vaccine rollouts, varying stages ""opening up"" plans, etc. Salty got rejected take approval ratings vaccines instead? think researchers scientist deserve credit anything else.

But country?

When stop contracting spreading it?

The UK centralised medical records - 233~ NHS trusts, messed track trace 30B behind - trust run bath, would trust vaccine passport system? Studies I've seen show evade pfizer (which likely means Moderna good well) Dead people always dead. Transportation made walking. Ban cars! feels like we're good last one get vaccine (or last one reach herd immunity). appreciate aware others despite vaccinated. I'd worry ticking strangers I'm fully vaccinated skipping wearing mask public places (they know I'm vaccinated I'm anti-masker).  

We're going months awkwardness us shots don't. Go things. go big-box store restaurant, might play optics game mask stay inside anymore driving crazy. mean, kids really bars? know parents habit bringing siblings bars young (at one point handing infant sister girl working coat-check, something joke day), really smartest idea? not. school goes back students, full-time tomorrow. b117 UK one?

Say hypothetical

1. Vaccine w/ mask vs. Unvaccinated w/mask = 90%
2. Vaccine w/o mask vs Unvaccinated w/o mask = 60%

Then 90% =/ 60%

Or say included white males:

1. White males w/ vaccine vs white males w/o vaccine = 90%. since controlled white male group 90% applies Hispanic women well since learning vaccine efficacy. 

But know control things gender, occupation, ethnicity study selecting one ethnicity multiples. maybe 50% wear mask vs 50% wear mask vaccinated unvaccinated groups ideal study design? Last Easter area super cautious. one traveled (that knew), everything quiet, etc. never seen many state rental cars today.

2. November surge NYC happen post Thanksgiving. Testing Nov 1-18 worthless, surge happened yet.

PSA don‚Äôt need wear mask public anymore. vaccine want it. statistics used cherry-picked. suggests covid smaller threat flu children treated less equal risk. masking flu, would mask disease lower risk That‚Äôs number kids died covid year higher number normally die flu.

The stats image normalized deaths CDC. I'm jump non-normalized deaths vs deaths figure they're wrong. Death natural part life. brand new cause death consists 3rd biggest killer country continuing take precautions larger portion ENTIRE population vaccinated ridiculous? Seriously, can‚Äôt wait til August? Source? Straw man argument. 

No one says kids ‚Äúimmune‚Äù, serious outcomes incredibly rare it‚Äôs non issues.

Currently covid killed 250 people aged 0-17 America 

Influenza kills average 400-500 people age 17 year 

Influenza far deadlier covid Welcome apartheid. probably surprised, go ahead make unfounded assumptions people know attempt discredit opinions beliefs via ad homenim rather actual coherent thought argument! go active it‚Äôs hard. live nobody EVER goes store without mask on. would probably get kicked out, get treated horrible looks rude whispers.

I think that‚Äôs real reason health officials want vaccinated keep wearing masks: maintain social pressure unvaccinated (like now) keep wearing gotten really annoying year. Okay, reason believe hidden long term effects covid, especially since barely get sick. Source? CDC says kids low risk covid vaccinated people without covid safety measures daily average number seems low since giving limited vaccinations since mid December.  4.5 million received least one dose. That‚Äôs close 12% within last month. Yeah why? mean it‚Äôs standard colleges require vaccinations bunch diseases already obviously covid Yes no. always certain part population genetic immunity one reason another. mean even AIDS small number people whose bodies kill virus causes major damage keep hearing things new variants hitting younger people harder, seeing news ton. actual studies/evidence younger people hospitalized/intubation/dying more, apart hearsay anecdotes? affect IFR younger people? enforced yes pretty much anyone go anywhere printing stupid paper saying going Oh wonder voted for?

&lt;sad, tune Trumpet music wafting didn‚Äôt say fuck old people I? 8,000 people die US every day. It‚Äôs part life.

Eh, nah. didn‚Äôt fail she‚Äôs woman, failed she‚Äôs bad governor. zero, means least someone voted him. curious missing something. 17 year old getting vaccinated tomorrow, I‚Äôve spent last two days refuting every stupid vaccine myth there. literally takes thirty second google search show meme saw internet wrong, exhausting. people honestly surprised kids spreading it? get go one taking kid covid serious early speculations didn‚Äôt effect them, they‚Äôve always able spread it. 

And anyone kid knows kids together room extended periods wipe village couple hundred years ago quickly collect spread bugs. 

Enter daycares... Many open months already limited full capacity parents need work keep economy alive. Long live economy! /s

It‚Äôs almost like government done more, earlier, could‚Äôve prepared more. Chicagoland? kids performed higher standardized testing? amazing job, rough get people arnt interested engaged online. know think statement obvious I‚Äôm Trump shell shocked still welcome statement. literally crave normal adult statements experts comment thread specifically addresses idea strain may present children, chain even specifically discussing idea *maybe children low-risk all.* 

If strain contagious infect vaccinated, back square one. took lots refreshing, wife manage get 2 weeks ago. Still, lot sooner expecting. Exposure kind lead mutations could hurt vaccines effectivity especially immunocompromised individuals who've walled inside homes year. fact remains multiple legitimate sources medical information US (not CDC), National Children‚Äôs Hospital specifically says use mask child 2 years old. goes beyond CDC‚Äôs guideline ‚Äî CDC pretty vague says adjust according child‚Äôs comfort level. 

So although claim person made wrong details, spirit claim completely accurate. confused CDC another legitimate, respected medical authority US. Meh, people dying old anyway. Fuck em, right? 

Seriously, 8 weeks left school year, fuck need rush it? can‚Äôt wait til next school year general public vaccinated? whole point can't voluntarily isolate 100% safe

You could. accent, do. Yah, didn‚Äôt many close friends high school dozens people loved talking everyday even didn‚Äôt really interact outside school, would pretty depressed without them. Surfaces barely spread virus, can't believe people still think significantly point. Fauci CDC told Americans get first one they‚Äôre 100% effective preventing hospitalization death. obvious hindsight. People 1920s still think women workforce great idea. WWII Rosie Riveter women finally taken seriously. People definitely thought women men's jobs inferior year WWI.

Same things said co-ed education, desegregation, letting students use calculators, computers electronic devices classrooms, etc. said things distracting promote quality education first came know wrong.

We come back realize years virtual/hybrid learning fine. reading right getting 2nd shot makes sad Let ask this: job? I'm assuming get time job, right? job set number responsibilities, right? stop job day, stop thinking job, right? 

Now imagine changed, blink eye, required job seven days week, fifteen hours day, added responsibilities trained for, entire year plus clear end sight, non-stop, also absolutely zero time off. past year plus like. 

Now, unless put someone else's shoes show little understanding compassion, suggest STFU. Woah, grandmas second dose June? Wow idea like there, I'm really sorry hear way things hope guys get vaccinated asap. Let's hope goes business then.  Okay what's point? rest us inconvenienced wanna punish antivaxxers? Depends country talking about. America many states going open regardless happens. Yeah, kids parents siblings older aunts uncles grandparents interact adults *except* vaccinated teachers. both!!!!! around NYC it‚Äôs difficult get appointment without lot hassle time, many people know waiting gets easier. Right numbers, especially Michigan, support claim... That‚Äôs point vaccine choose get it. 55% 65+ fully vaccinated 75% one dose. 60-90 age groups make 80% covid deaths. It‚Äôs time open god. isn‚Äôt downvoted. ""believe missing going bar seeing friends wanting life back""?

Nothing wrong wanting things go back normal. Kinda. goes ~80% 2 weeks shot 1 ~90% 2 week shot 2. 

That may seem like small bump, it‚Äôs different 1 5 people would gotten covid still getting Covid 1 10. Percentages crazy like that.  Like, amazing easy refute not. surveillance test November January one school person.

Do favor. Go [NYC Dept Education COVID testing website go page 297. page 297 pages 342 find school school level surveillance testing results November 1st 18th. Kids school in-person half November testing. favor got page 250 look forward page 175. Look surveillance testing results in-person students staff January. Also, look site, see there's also data December. How's possible? wrong yet again. [PK-5 reopened schools December kids in-person school December winter break. That's because[ ditched 3% rule moved state level 9% Wrong again.


And check confirm NYC positivity rate higher January December means **community spread worse January December yet NYC schools continued host in-person schooling surveillance testing. surveillance test 10%+

Wrong again. NYC never hit 7 day rolling average 10%+ positivity November days hit 10% plus like January 12th hit 12.3%. guess what, kids schools surveillance testing happening day. look results [on page 221 short, literally wrong everything said. covid, feel like wanna sleep? I've sick assume cold...and I've wanted sleep.. 50% could still months away though... ugh means UK variant contagious us seen. it‚Äôs becoming dominant variant.

Shouldn't vaccinate people instead? guys trying bibi fur corruption  laugh US record COVID vaccination piece card stock. one idea ever need show anything people concerned protect piece card stock. Wrong. Pfizer vaccines arrived Israel December. started vaccinating mid December. only, paid much per vaccine provided data unparalleled vaccine company given done millions people 30,000 I'm pretending anything. one created persona me. wish! are, that's really world works. Perhaps trump promised BiBi free vaccine US Dime.

Please knock personal attacks. understand feel need get personal positive article covid. they're literally banana republic! TIL :) F realize Pfizer US company, right? Yer data skewed towards USA. need look big picture. Maybe open 2022?

No. Per Bloomberg, 75% population fully vaccinated within 3 months. enough drastically lower rate transmission. able reopen around July 4th 2021. Stupid stupid does. ... bet *will* want free health care acute hospitalization social benefits Long COVID Lol ok. Left pocket right pocket, it‚Äôs pair pants. Every dollar Israel gets US one dollars doesn‚Äôt spend, accounting irrelevant. boots taste? contributing factor, that's likely enough herd immunity. I've read reinfection rare, see sources support statement. know though. thought opposite; body would used handling virus second time easier time fighting off.

How vaccine work? know mRNA produces covid-like proteins help produce antibodies. antibodies go away too? body continuously produce proteins forever long period time? Pfizer throwing doses away. still get used stop worldwide pandemic Ah crap. mistake. vaccines surplus case country needs vaccinate people future.

So really problem solving immediate crisis Fuck don‚Äôt think people pointing different demographics different reasons skepticism ones creating racial divisions. Tuskegee experiment happened living memory. far grounded reality, would terrible idea whole. 

The nation state could leverage vaccines whole new way. specified... religious people... white?!?!

Then okay blame religion cuz we're drilling little. Realistically, nothing getting prolonged. enough rest vaccinated, pandemic over, even disease lingers.

Yes Ok boils blindly following CDC without understanding why, can't really get mad trying dig logic &amp; concluding something offer none.

This conversation clearly over.  Sort of, really. vaccine, almost definitely die COVID, even get sick variant. variants might make vaccines less effective, mean vaccinated people could potentially (big emphasis potentially, talking theoretical here) infect unvaccinated readily. However, vaccinated population still protecting unvaccinated decreased community spread. Remember, less effective vaccines still effective vaccines.

The anti-vaxxers get ""completely destroyed"". They'll increased chance getting COVID (but probably still much lower chance someone living US year). would create ""long tail"" pandemic, instead dropping near negligible levels, low-level community spread long time. COVID variants would become nuisance public health officials years, deadliness COVID would slowly drop everyone picked cell immunity (one way another) rather dropping cliff like would everyone got vaccine. infectious - think infecting younger people still debate. younger people infected, clear that's environmental / behavioural factors variant better infecting younger people. That‚Äôs exactly true...

Obviously rare side effects could missed clinical trial pop one vaccinated deeds millions people. Ron DeSantis ever handled anything well? know I'm going get flamed saying but, time remind teens get hard things. things get rough get better remember throughout lives. Depression come go too. 

Don't repeat narrative something wrong intense feelings something awful happened. like rest lives. Remind feelings happen, normal, got this, get anything else comes up. 

Remind them, stronger it. victory, grow future problems seem smaller comparison. 

It hard, hard things grow people. *And things getting better*. 

Actually, *tell adults too*. hide agree can‚Äôt hide control clearly isn‚Äôt (in China) moment. Yeah you‚Äôre probably fine. system probably date. agree lot explanations. However, certain amount randomness this....

For example, one gym single handily responsible 15% Covid infection city last week... It‚Äôs probably even that, that‚Äôs could directly prove.

Depending size business, fine. went college early, young (if coronavirus happened year) gotten vaccine. hope exceptions granted non-eligible vaccination. watch half people wear masks put properly. tired this. politicians nothing, scientists disappointed, people don‚Äôt care restrictions anymore. Also changes Astra didn‚Äôt help either... CDC doesn‚Äôt want kids vaccinated, you‚Äôre right.

FL today 16+ vaccines Walmart (the place could schedule vaccine appointment week) still said 40+ went ahead scheduled 40+. still allow get shot morning (when supposed arrive)? 


I getting Moderna shot scheduled Friday- I'm getting hell sub forever. Floridian idea Desantis getting shit this. practically live Publix, better alternative distributing vaccines there? can‚Äôt throw rock without hitting side Publix. main concern 1) accurate PCR tests 2) we're going paying debt back many years.

It's stretch say lot COVID-related social media behavior virtue signaling without backing up. lot posting IG masks distancing followed friends over. 

The constant shaming idiots throwing parties help either. I've met friends three times year every single time someone goes rant people breaking COVID restrictions. Like... think we're right now? People impression spread people throw large parties wear masks grocery stores. man, spread people spend 90% time following restrictions 10% time breaking them, way, that's 90% people.

The future vaccination might mRNA vaccines multiple viral proteins... Exciting stuff. know getting better hang on. British person whole idea seems totally bizarre. Could someone explain? something vaccine passports? That‚Äôs incredibly short sighted. confidence interval large meaningless though... I'm asbsolutely certain lockdowns restrictions online school much this. 

But anyone agree political conflict total uncertainty terrible leadership also contributed? 

I friend family members might speak this. people supposed going support something like, fighting with, getting disrespected disturbed by. really big problem located single city, they'll test lockdown millions virus escape Exactly.

Testing cell responses means get cells patient lab (alive), expose antigen vaguely physiologic way, test response somehow. It‚Äôs labour intensive.... That's we're talking obvious reader. People voting spite. Lucky us virus known quickly spread states /s agree that, dont get variant supposed infected whole South Africa contagious hasnt. Numbers way since December. course could summer waves, compare countries similar situations like Brazil strange country South Africa well. (biased scientific) gut feel SA variant contagious less severe. didnt get point, dont trust governement institut, dont even bother listen CDC studies. believe hype covid idiots, 0.15% die pussys? Yeah first reaction pretty fast back march 2020 positively susprised. Since summer things gone downward group covid deniers is, least perception, bigger countries. Pair incompetent corrupt government gets caught red handed least weekly (german quality newspaper ""S√ºddeutsche"" article last week corruption Austria called ""this.is.not.normal"", basically stating western country politicians would step back level corruption incompetence) completely fucked vaccine-procurement national level, also EU-wide level appointing guy responsible national procurement process lead negotiator EU procurement team. laughing stock EU moment.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Nope. I‚Äôm vaccinated. Everyone know vaccinated. I‚Äôm flying around country locking doorknobs making everyone. many people get measles vaccine later contract measles? Chicken pox? Polio? Multiple neighbors vaccinating kids. 
This going long fight schools mandate it, take governments instead school boards boards proven backbone. unlikely. Total vaccines reached 260 000 60 mil people would make big impact. everyone holy fuck 2020 blast me. finish school work 2-3 hours kick rest day smoking weed gaming w da bois UK kids schools tested twice week covid

No they‚Äôre - it‚Äôs children secondary school (basically 11/12 up). absolutely NOT. Let distance learning next several years. long majority get vaccinated I'm good. vaccines becoming available I'm far less concerned refuse get shot(s) since they'll longer major public safety risk. wanna remain high risk good luck them. concerns dogs new super spreader? drove past slate park / basketball court yesterday. must 50 60 young kids, none wearing masks, close proximity. Parents need keep tight leash children, especially teenagers. There's reason kids socializing right now, new variant, that's especially critical. soon get near end mess, sure enough someone fuck up. think herd immunity previous strain might achieved. virus evolves faster response time found way. pointing result study still recommendation wear mask now, regardless likely people vaccination spread covid.

Critically thinking obviously strong suit others latching onto: ""But study said unlikely! actually know 4000 clinically statistically significant, new variants emerging act differently, critical thinking better people study actually wrote recommendation"".

I love redditors imply critical thinking skills. long vaccines job making virus non lethal everyone, even matter spreads, it'll another seasonal flu. Hope shit gets soon. cant make delusional people self aware zero critical thinking capability.

Being anti-CCP free ride spout retardation.

No one hide virus grows exponentially. Again, it‚Äôs still inaccurate term 

B.1.135, P.1, multiple mutations RBD. affect antibody binding. dont. Even case B.1.135, E484K K417N RBD mediate antibody escape. zero justifiable, scientific reason calling ‚Äúdouble mutant‚Äù boomers sad told they'd higher ever before! It‚Äôs unlikely single dose work ever. 
Measles highly human-adapted virus many conserved domains, one doesn‚Äôt undergo genetic shifts coronaviruses deploy. 
There virtually immunologists think single vaccine suffice, booster vaccine research proceeding apace. Republicans Democrats anything deaths. Yer getting lost political weeds... partisanship rot yer mind almost quickly religion. ""Hundreds cases per day"" cause concern people getting sick. Israel pay vaccines received, pay future vaccines. NYT shouldn‚Äôt editorialize ‚Äúdespite‚Äù phrasing, even climbers showing early (and probably are). worries, US pay bill apologize istrael another 500 billion dolars agree bargain! Far cheaper would thought. ‚ÄúClinicians still suspicion SARS-CoV-2 infections patients acute respiratory infections, even patient previously infected,‚Äù Josh G. Petrie, PhD, research assistant professor department epidemiology University Michigan School Public Health, told Healio. ‚ÄúGiven behavior seasonal coronaviruses fact past pandemic influenza viruses become endemic, likely continue SARS-CoV-2 transmission.‚Äù admit, I'm wuss effects I've heard, especially since age group tends worse. know I'll get someday soon. vaccination rate across every non-maritime province less same, single exception Manitoba. Data back available know what's going Manitoba. massive outlier.  Exactly. US taxpayers paying vaccines anyway saying allow black people group

I say that. oh ok house arrest people forcibly vaccinated unapproved vaccine First, hospitalizations =/= cases.

Second, I'm homework you. state cases deaths decreased they've plateaued. Based stupid everyone acted Easter, I'd suspect cases go two weeks. However, time vaccinations going state changed anyone 16 get vaccination starting today.

There two variables closed system. pretending usually done someone seeking truth. sub crazy, OP gets downvoted asking fair simple question. Y‚Äôall way trigger happy.  EU doesn‚Äôt need get involved. Pfizer choose vaccines destined country isn‚Äôt paying them. Moderna‚Äôs around $65/two doses. ""discussion"" thread think reasonable people differing points view part discussion. Imagine thinking essential services used profit mongering extremely left almost like job travels lot something idky maybe pfizer jannies live siting data way Facebook conspiracy theorist does.  Mask mandates lifted case increase Texas Pennsylvania negligible. rest us, appear grasping straws make argument less clear.

&amp;#x200B;

Again, narrative trying push? PR Netanyahu. trying portray political opponents irresponsible making Israel look bad.

The reason opponent Gantz refused agree government meeting decision would made, unless Netanyahu also agrees nominate justice minister meeting. Israel currently justice minister since previous minister split Gantz's party, Supreme Court said Gantz can't defense minister justice minister.

So Gantz wants appoint new justice minister, Netanyahu want justice minister influence Netanyahu's corruption trial. welcome. UK started Israel, Israel got doses return health data. 

It never implied Israel pay. little hard identify exactly people afraid of. idea variants emerge contagious evade vaccine delicious sinister plot twist people can't let idea go, even ample evidence show happening.

It also worth noting 80-90% efficacy vaccine often cited types illness including moderate. vaccines actually effective severe outcomes i.e. almost zero deaths virus vaccinated people.

So soon virus spreads widely can't make sick kill you. point, threat exactly? talking vaccine passports international travel, could see happening. talking vaccine passports everyday things, see lasting long contact tracing US.

REMEMBER THAT!!? Got first Pfizer jab Saturday...few side effects...my dongs 3""s bigger constantly smell roses.  BIG THANKS GIRLS BOYS PFIZER.... AMAZING... ordered stuff budget? even legal? know long term effects covid mild severe. studies showing damage kid's vascular system covid mild systems. thanks, kid die heart attack 40 wanted sent daycare.

We also know covid like something like chicken pox mild children, re-emerge years later terrible effect. Alright admit mistake, said. Please explain mask mandate caused hospitalization decrease. explain even mentioned title article never said anything it? true. might true; could briefed media one two sides dispute inside Israeli government, rather directly company. fact, that's likely, I'd say. Israel first mass vaccination return provide data Pfizer side effects. like large lab experiment millions people. learn data collected there. especially important get data groups like pregnant women, transplant patients chronic diseases vaccine wasn‚Äôt tested. risk population. experiment.

It‚Äôll save everyone tons time. r/politics extremist left ideas LOL. Still obsessed reinfection, see . . . PA easy state prove everything said wrong. Thats nice. could actually get vaccinations thr 55+ crowd great. 80yr old grandmother got vaccine last week. parents (mid 60s) still can't appointments. Meanwhile, 30yr old cousins vaccinated month ago. wouldn‚Äôt expect country commits crimes humanity pay bills‚Ä¶ give data back claims, I'm research you. know there‚Äôs sub unexpected Night Vale, one *unnecessary* Night Vale? Thank Google it, won‚Äôt sound ignorant, you‚Äôll find relationship strong GOP identification refusing vaccine. one source. White evangelicals highly likely GOP, religious groups not.

I deny religion used‚Äîand still used‚Äîas justification motivation horrible things. Reddit atheist ‚Äúit comes back religion‚Äù crowd embarrassing. genocides Maoist China, Khmer Rouge, Soviet Union motivated perpetrators‚Äô religion? course not, occurred regimes heavily restricted religion. Well leader get caught taking bribes, got caught started bribes sent wife, also go caught.

The country still seems happy leadership.

Brother, sure sounds like banana republic ya got there. expect fair number people get new cards boosters get rolled reason. HMOs negotiating price it‚Äôs cost thousands Well, yeah, people know vaccinated promptly resumed lives. Travel, friends, family, restaurants, bars, etc.

Covid ""still around"" vaccinated immune. Measles, chicken pox, meningitis, etc. ""still around"" people living lives decades. part it. Another part vaccines question needed right now. already enough vaccines vaccinate entire population. vaccines meant used half year now, case current vaccine provide long term immunity.

There huge debate Israel whether worth spending money currently future vaccines might even needed. think ultimately going matter. They're highly effective hospitalization death. know of. really complicated judgement call make. Way complex than, suspect, anyone commenting reddit capable making judgement call over.

Yeah, envy responsibility making decisions literal life death millions people. false true? plenty people reddit said removing mask mandate would cause cases increase. Yes, that‚Äôs new buzzword support anti-science pro voter suppression stance. yes. really care parasitic corporations want, important things money, namely ending pandemic. Pfizer US company, would lol /sad Ffff. I'll pay twice that, pocket, get vaccine. bananas grow Israel? official line CDC Individuals fully vaccinated COVID-19 able meet small, private gatherings vaccinated individuals low-risk individuals unvaccinated without masking social distancing, according far ""dude got COVID"", details matter... sure covid something else i.e. test positive? long vaccination get it? severe symptoms? Studies show vaccine effective (starting 14 days first dose) unlikely get even unlikely severe illness. idea read I'm citing data, I'm pushing conspiracy theory. headline cnn scientific evidence lasts six months. mean last longer. means reasonably proven lasts 6 months.  time yet. new virus. Reinfection happen without vaccine. However get mild symptoms all. Vaccines good efficacy **severe** illness. understand difference correlation causation? {that's 90% efficacy Thanks link, realize started yet.

Ship EU.  looking okay, damn close getting shot. (It would taken 10-14? days immunity build, still.) stigma people isnt easy?  problem approach don‚Äôt know long term effects COVID kids. COVID something similar shingles rear head future? saying petrified kids getting it. saying don‚Äôt know consequences getting would be. Curious think evangelicals racial supremacists. I've never single church banned people particular race. Churches segregated race tend way choice that's congregants choose attend. Black people choose attend black churches. White people choose attend white churches. already it, worse unvaccinated lot people caught covid second time (because antibodies first last forever) much worse illness. 1.	The ‚Äòdouble mutant‚Äô nomenclature pure fearmongering bullshit. EVERY variant multiple mutations.
2.	it‚Äôs going soread like fire us us significantly better vaccinated places signed ask covid symptoms give appointment.

This ensure country close normal without lockdown everyone vaccinated. forget black evangelicals... brown muslims... orthodox jews... combination skin color religion... actually ignore skin color... cuz fault religion. know area, recommendation CDC kids 2 older need wear masks. know places 5 older instead agree big problem. discussing start mask training toddler turns 2 big shock... using Astra Zeneca vaccine

Asking know dude got COVID getting vaccine, kind freaked I‚Äôm asking see posts vaccine beginning erosion privacy rights anti-vaxx agenda. give vaccine doses us Canadians, right? lmao Wait feel better. ‚ÄúThose people selfish. Don‚Äôt know there‚Äôs *literal global pandemic‚Äù?!?!!?*
- sub, March 2020-March 2021 Okay, really think thats new though? time 13 18 - always picked kids, rumors thrown about, couldn‚Äôt trust many people. home life also really bad got picked stress manifests behavioral/physical problems. home, least could choose wanted time school constantly reminded much life sucked. idealizing feel school like remember opposed school life vast majority children suffer silently kids supposed ‚Äúhaving fun happy.‚Äù school system terrible, rewards torments many. Covid saved relationship way. felt lot pressure 'not boring' months started living together nearly led us breaking up. covid, first presumed 'boring' society became norm, lost pressure perfectly happy 'boring' together. (Putting boring ''s boring eyes status quo).  one decided pandemic hit raising chosen kids. little empathy. making false equivalence. Local lawmakers ban alcohol want, whereas voting must meet certain standards undue burden. 

That means voting without id legally debatable.  things open back tho becomes social time extreme, I‚Äôm gonna feel even isolated revieved EMA well, might approved. expert? hmm great title Yeah, don‚Äôt three kids come asking sympathy. one held gun head forced procreate like that. 

If want kids go right ahead them! good you! 

Just don‚Äôt expect care complaints life harder three kids worry about. shit, Sherlock. enough correct, masks magic. least (along social distancing) someone try protect others.

Unfortunately, people even that. Transmission stop till least 70% population vaccinated, point reach herd immunity.

I think US given 28% people first dose. They're way herd immunity. Lockdown 2: Electric Boogaloo What‚Äôs benefit exclusivity though? It‚Äôs free vaccine. Unless they‚Äôre getting benefit people come stores shop get shot don‚Äôt thing Publix needs help getting people come stores. sandwiches pretty much take care that. get dude, edgy cool. That's desperate hear right? Oof heard AZ vaccine 10% efficiency rate South African variant couldn‚Äôt believe it, hope get vaccinated asap something works them. Who's decision kids? yours. hate people different easier lifes get vaccine sick moment? bit unclear whether harm get vaccinated actually infected? think COVID though, probably minor cold (no fever, small taste ok, sore throat sneezing every 2 hours). Thank responsible parent. kids 5 2 gonna people vaccinated protect even can't. UK expecting J&amp;J July. Moderna expected slow deliveries. Next UK home grown Novavax sometime second half May huge amount doses. time start vaccinating Palestinians something lol Speaking 10%, that‚Äôs percent small study concluded studied AZ‚Äôs efficiency South African variant.  last post got removed like source, despite data same. Let's see happens time. even post hell, subreddit gunna spew bullshit like that?  Leftists really trying pick fight infrastructure bill üôÑ I've seen little lasts long, Mods pretty good IMO removing anti-vax misinformation.  Unlike EU UK country queue jumpers.
If late queue wait turn UK fatality rate fell least partly due quite extreme lockdown. know that... Doubt it, don‚Äôt even bother asking questions check ID I‚Äôm guessing haven‚Äôt kid covid guys attacking OP? Holy crap people sub get wagging finger. much anti-vaxx rhetoric sub going allow? It‚Äôs ignorant fear-mongering. poor kids won‚Äôt getting vaccines cause dumbass parents :( Yes no. areas are, aren't. think mostly coming schools/sports teams/spring breakers/st patrick's day. everyone Freshman high school here. Worst year life.

If math right, I‚Äôve spent 6.7% life lockdown. That‚Äôs fun. 

There‚Äôs Pfizer trial opening area think I‚Äôm going sign up. It‚Äôs chance early shot. imagine meant soften blow vaccine passports young people vaccinated yet. Instead able get free test, give certificate get pub days.

Whether young people go it, know. sounds like quite imposition me, twice week. I've test pleasant experience. sort thing might put greater good crisis, frankly crisis seems passing. We've vaccinated population contribute 99% hospitalisations. Fatalities 10 day (admittedly bank holiday weekend, still). Overall excess deaths negative. Fewer people died week March 2021 corresponding week March 2019. I'm young person sounds like hard sell me. Wasnt easter couples houres ago??? still remember start pandemic media outlets running constant propaganda israel developing new covid vaccine every week....all bs. lo behold vaccine discovered germans, israel gets Gods' chosen tribe privilege vaccinates first anyway tells german company f pay. 

They're probably waiting daddy goyim USA foot bill usual. Hahaha, time decided, put together committee decide implement it, put bids government contract, test validate vendor go with, implement across 50 states, fight legal challenges court. well 2022 nobody care. kindergarten kid can't get though he's got bad asthma. back normal fall since turn filled antivaxers antimaskers. Covid passport now?

You might learn floodgates argument logical fallacy.

You‚Äôre sowing fear vaccine need contain virus. It‚Äôs anti-vaccine rhetoric based fact. guess Pfizer demand prepayment full payment ever received now. simply give doses countries larger need. 

They can‚Äôt serious, get vaccines country world, don‚Äôt pay still expect vaccines? Hope EU block shipment. Lock Ron Up! parts Canada B117 amounted 90% recent cases P1 variant (Brazil variant) spreading places well. It‚Äôs bringing lot younger people ICU original covid-19 it‚Äôs spreading well.

The people get vaccinated better, we‚Äôre close finish line variants picking think we‚Äôll good worst it. Really hoping export doses neighbors north asap well. find funny lots people super obese unhealthy they‚Äôre telling people. ‚ÄúYou putting poison body, millions going die‚Äù eating super unhealthy food that‚Äôs actually poison lots actually dying unhealthy lifestyle. think reason lots people weird they‚Äôre familiar mRNA technology. It‚Äôs something new, different way deal virus. Gime time they‚Äôll come around see helping. wonder face covered helped also? interesting stuff. Same. wife entire family vaccinating it‚Äôs exhausting constantly checking science. hate Facebook. ""Why happy life? got shallow dopamine quick-fixes available"" No.

The UK considers died less 28 days testing positive. excludes spending 28 days ICU. Lol us live control idiots state doing. business would halt shipment pay.. That's rather silly statement.

It's bit complicated that.  heard lot variance this. wife got J&amp;J shot arm sore could lift head 2-3 days. got first Pfizer shot barely felt thing either time later. lot muscle shoulders though (seriously).

Part shot literally injecting nontrivial amount liquid muscle. Shoulder muscles relatively complex shot goes probably matters. different vaccines different quantities liquid.

And, Palestinian living Israel controlled territories.

They human too. Yeah report feels lot like misleading propaganda people question restrictions. 

Anecdotally, sister medicaid/medicare therapist practice open slot months. 3x patients normal. 

Another anecdote, friend mine looking get therapy similar type service told 2 month wait. unheard of. hid massacre 3,000 protestors hiding ongoing genocide.

Clearly well know it. That's solid joke I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre right. However, groups usually fringes extremists‚Äîmainstream religion used facilitate vaccination, especially hard-to-reach communities. lot comments purely political nature, thought wasnt allowed sub Exactly ^^ Israel need stockpile vaccines already supplied enough entire population rest world struggling get enough supply. I'd say there's less defense Pfizer ship vaccine ship elsewhere needed. anyone explain cases going expect finally go stay down. tanking morale. Seriously, can‚Äôt wait til August?

Some people waiting year. Stop moving goal posts. Yeah, wouldn‚Äôt private company love banana republic? don‚Äôt enough every country costs money make. See problem? me. early discussion side effects really scared me, knowing multiple people got vaccine either mild reactions I‚Äôm less afraid that. There‚Äôs something comforting knowing people issues, even it‚Äôs anecdotal evidence. hid massacre 3,000 protestors

I guess everyone knows massacre happen. widely reported news reporters world despite CCPs repeated denial. successfully getting hidden? people world actually know hiding ongoing genocide

I problem believing genocide happening Xinjiang. Yes believe communist party totally capable leaving borders remote province (that history wanting secede China) closed outside world. page there. But... Beijing? Shanghai? major cities China international news agencies presence? people dying China covid, think news would start leaking covid killing people China alleged genocide. no, single credible report past year except original outbreak city Wuhan entire province getting sealed off. Wuhan bustling like major Chinese cities btw.

Your Miami analogy: think Chinese even know first amendment is? risk dying covid, think Chinese people say ""my life, freedom"" wear masks, let alone partying inside conference hall?

Sorry man, see bad argument still. vaccinated near future, natural immunity already. Question, let's say 80% population gets vaccine (or more) say well fear. leaves small percentage people vaccine. 
So would small percent people cause pandemic last longer? either build immunity naturally die, problem solved right? One companies invented fentanyl I'm really appalled people sub celebrate things. there's daily caloric limit people allowed otherwise insurance stops covering stuff?

Free someone pay make, transport store falls government  Israel already enough vaccine citizens, shipment surplus storage, stocking fall next year case immunity last long. asking deeper question that's problematic answer. There's evidence carbohydrate addiction (which leads obesity)is real thing like addiction nicotine, alcohol heroin. 

Is lifestyle choice one addicted? think so.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Well like antibody test priced way first came out, also go price Hell yeah would, I'm fully vaccinated I'd 100% go places fully vaccinated people.

Imagine people 1 year+ avoided covid whole time, finally full vaccination state, going somewhere fully-vaccinated people sounds like fantastic idea finally get feel sort normalcy, worrying dying lol. It‚Äôs kinda messed Israel already enough vaccines entire country. According comments apparently payment extra vaccine, may may need. Meanwhile countries don‚Äôt even supply vaxx entire population yet. Actually rather infuriating... per international law. occupying power controls borders access medication infrastructure around required law support occupied population times natural crises. thing would apply massive earthquake relief needed.  must.

And countries must vaccinate citizens quickly possible permit this, even widespread community transmission (e.g. Australia, NZ). Currently families separated across international borders. Healthy millennials get hospitalized suffer long COVID. ones risk poor health probably already vaccinated. ""..the vaccine beginning erosion privacy rights anti-vaxx agenda.""

Please, stop trying attribute different opinions big bad boogie man anti-vax.  perfectly acceptable concerned erosion privacy rights still favor vaccines. Hell, despise current state privacy (or lack thereof) I'm favor sticking vax every arm wants it. sure many intend buy think get kind bulk discount whole nation states able get. think BMJ indicated 0.5% false positives, 23% false negatives. need encourage people symptoms act cautiously negative test perhaps test day later. everyone bar indeed fully vaccinated, yes maskless. get serious global vaccination.

and love holy, **get vaccinated** available you! stop spreading shitty misinformation encourages vaccine hesitancy. SUPER easy get vaccinated wild number people declining :| Netanyahu crook Israel would well finally get rid him. assume contracted stadium? Yeah, that's probably enough people keep churning newer dangerous mutations original strain. Vaccines far 100% preventing hospitalization. also proof vaccines stop spread COVID. feel like directly impacts (because they're SUPER low risk). However, want travel somewhere, go concert, live student housing, etc. requires proof vaccination, bet go get vaccine. suddenly get vaccines others refuse it.. That's counter productive. may well supply, personally receive need. Well they've spaffed ¬£34bn wall test trace suppose they've got justify somehow.

 Interesting Hancock saying getting back normal hinges people getting tested regularly day vaccine getting back normal depended Health Ministry putting pressure government approve purchase additional NIS 3.5 billion - 30 million vaccines - even Passover government set convene last Monday. However, meeting postponed indefinitely due conflict Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Alternate Prime Minister Benny Gantz.

I trust civil servants political appointee day. People got get jabs live lives. Can‚Äôt fearful anxious forever  Well history Israels success story bit complex paid early high prices. 
Netanyahu needed success story political reason . wanted early comes vaccinations. Since China Russia Allies Israels enemies two countries weren`t option small rich countries where. US said early one would us surply people first. mean would India left exports strict controlled India doesn`t produce big masses MNRA vaccines. 
So Netanyahu tried ally EU-Staates ( without vaccine production) declined would make seperate deals . 
So Netanyahu basically bet Pfizer/Biontech since old Friend C.O. Pfizer bet vaccine early on. since Pfizer fabric EU didn`t need weary exports bans. 
But important thing money paid, something way valuable. lot data healthcare system infrastructure provide it. Israel could case become kinda Phase 4 study entire world. 
And Israel became bad situation world champion vaccination. 
The narrative Israel ""where smart paid others, thats ahead anybody else "" really accurate ( narritive english media, especially ones close econmy , likes push). always kinda ""betting contest"" vaccines, prices would WAY HIGHER , considering overall cost pandemic. barely banana, let alone republic. yeah, got meaning. theory, sure. reality, completely powerless anything like implement vaccine rollout without Israeli government's full cooperation. like saying First Nation tribes US handling covid independently. Hm bigger country can't throw money manufacturer buy vaccine. give manufacturer money support expand production facilities like US. JJ vaccine (66% effective symptoms ~85% effective severe symptoms) effective still stopping community spreading since it‚Äôs 66%? Like still get COVID transmittable, won‚Äôt severe? Right ship gov‚Äôt mess make up? Supreme Court ruled business didn‚Äôt sell cake gay people. That‚Äôs made up. think read tone comment wrong though, genuinely asking, cause us discriminate gay person surely merit virus could actually kill (which someone gay not) Wait - CA, grocery workers DEFINITELY protected class. considered food service. go federal pharmacy get vaccine (CVS, Rite-Aid, Wal-greens, Wal-Mart).  Let know need help. you, I'd schedule one right opens 16+ next week gets harder get appointment bit. What? Suicides metric harm mental health? mental health issues rise. Ask mental health professional tell you. Access treatment people schizophrenia, bipolar, desperation etc. severely limited, leading increase imprisonment homeless, well general exacerbation symptoms many. 

I‚Äôm far ‚Äúright-wing‚Äù please don‚Äôt try put Gaza talking about, talking PA, west Bank, gaza confirm I‚Äôm one adults. anxiety pandemic would appear super stressed. find general anxiety shut whole day sometimes. requested vaccine Isreal strictly controls ability get Isreal said, ""no"". Isreal blocked transfers vaccines West Bank Gaza ongoing genocide Palestinian people. rest world refused pay inflated price Israel agreed to, apparantely Israel willing keep paying either, especially reserve batch. pay journalism. boat trump... know corruption prove it. people could make happen probably bring paid off. talking Palestinians animals lack agency. Palestinians government manage affairs government. capable organizing things, exactly here. happen years. Remember, health insurance cover unapproved experimental treatments. vaccine reached FDA approval yet, still trials. 

That's insurance charged vaccine...possibly ""consultation/visit"" depending go(like walk clinic government drive thru type facility) vaccine. government footing bill shot itself. Lol, money health dumb idea Israel produce, notion ""vaccine nationalism"" probably alien them.

It wirth see vaccines scarce. worth paying way buyers greatly supplied. Also, given relatively small size, lack local production, payed much, would experiencing supply problems.

And, finally, although agree together, support region (EU) one important vaccine exporters, understand actions ISR. 18 can't receive vaccine. 

why that? Fantastic see Canada moving on. Favorite country never been! It‚Äôs never gonna over. We‚Äôve got take jab live lives there‚Äôs always gonna risk I'm big believer kids making lot decisions themselves. Certainly medical decisions. think understood said.

I said people motivated right thing relatively mechanisms. One personal cost (which withholding claims payments would imply). 

I'm asking you: mechanism would use? told one would use. needs small too, US EU counties would problems paying $56 per citizen. Pfizer able squeeze extra 660 million doses US like could squeeze 18 million doses Israel. Paying really increase speed US, big. Considering kids don‚Äôt approved vaccine that‚Äôs still ways off. Zillenial got it. Almost everyone talk around age wants already gotten it. Must regional thing. minister health appointed Netanyahu. reports majority ministry disagree buying vaccines. Mental health issues increased dramatically result lockdowns. Also, access treatment people bipolar, schizophrenia anxiety severely limited, leading increased imprisonment homeless populations. It‚Äôs unfortunate Yes understand you‚Äôre saying. I‚Äôm talking posts saying effect ‚Äúdon‚Äôt get vaccinated it‚Äôs beginning losing privacy.‚Äù averaging 1.7 million first doses day, roughly 0.5% total population per day. Yeahhh I‚Äôm tbh, neighbors north could really use help. heard they‚Äôre one dose approach well, commenter mentioned 85 year old grandmother got vaccinated week ago second dose isn‚Äôt scheduled **June.**

Europe especially well tbh. often hold elections. They're rigged. (Ron Howard) *He understand things work* get deleted ""bad quality science"" science gods? vaccinate kids lot things keep discomfort keep spreading disease vulnerable. vaccinate chickenpox flu I'm worried either. Still notice mental health still big issue especially younger people can't get socialize Trudeau tabled budget 2 years problem spending money countries willing pay inflated price Israel paid, apparantely Israel willing keep paying either.  black evangelicals don‚Äôt want vaccine...for reason white evangelicals...is okay? Yes is. strong evidence obesity correlates much severe cases COVID, means hospitalizations/etc, higher burden strained public health resources pandemic. 

I find downright hilarious reddit encouraging us empower health insurance companies deny treatment coverage Americans. Yes, truly pressing issue day. Health insurance companies \*too\* generous. one's defending him, important accurate criticism. Netanyahu corrupt racist, dictator. Remember infections reported today infections happened 1-3 weeks ago vaccinations take 2-3 weeks impact.

This really good point. lag time. Looking forward numbers coming weeks. NY State hit 1 5 people fully vaccinated weekend 1 3 people least one shot. So, fingers crossed. 3 month old vaccine. *shutters* Israel blocked importing vaccines Gaza, relented international bad press. Yeah despite positive surge, one top states administering vaccines we've received far. Opened general public March 30th hitting around 46,625/day last week. Thank you, sometimes really need positive energy go fear. hopeful next 3 months least 60+ vaccinated take burden hospitals deaths, year pandemic controlled things looking little better streets. Like, probably still use mask, wash hands avoid large crowds people quite time, i'd love feel safe go street, meet friends family regularly travel again. lockdown paired zero covid strategy universal vaccination policy. Dictators tend hold corrupt elections. Supply demand work?  believe US broken, insane, driven corporate interests actually things, absolutely needed slow pace mutation selective pressure variants escape vaccine. So, failure prolong pandemic guarantee ongoing death toll eventually hideously normalized ""cost business.""

1,000 times ‚òùÔ∏è know people don‚Äôt like ones lump everyone group together same. It‚Äôs come many issues country. feel black evangelicals? okay skin color?  Imagine pet complete control could leave, go out, kind interaction could pets, could go walk,
etc.

Would expect pet unilaterally go vet get treatment felt ill? 

Israel occupying power must held accountable. Israeli. Yes happens time. Mental health issues climbing. Suicides lagging indicator. Also issue. There‚Äôs doubt lockdowns put wrench mental health relate. feel riddled guilt too, end, health compromised 13 year old really really wants school. much back forth (and many stressful/sleepless nights), sent back hybrid mental health really good n95. Two weeks later - school going open FULL time week based dumb 3ft CDC change. really limit feel comfortable with, worked district past 9 months, feel like rug pulled us. going pull her, envision lots sleepless upset nights everyone. need support group us parents! I'm willing get vaccinated. Coronaviruses seem long term effects. definitely think cautious kids mask cases high. Vaccinating willing 12 cases really low. Israel massive success 50% adults it.

We know long term effects keeping kids developmentally inappropriate environments isolation devastating effects psychologically. known quantity. kind hyperbole works point want make people attitude people arguing based things say read original comment closely enough. Yeah, annoying multiple people comment things like ""You kids go this, eh?"" making valid point. fine guys, U.S. cover cost. That's works. variants. Slacking suppression mitigation measures going allow variants spread form. matter time, pretty short amount time, variant vaccines far less effective emerges. basically repeat late 2020, again. someone else said, week wait mingle, risk reduces further. need stick use proven protection measures us get vaccinated chance controlling virus. Otherwise forever seeing outbreaks new variants. Possibly bbooster later year, winter, depending variants expanding widespread time. already get flu jab anyway autumn. ministry health agree practically begging government get shipped immediately. Cuomo great leader handled pandemic perfectly. brother said TV Cuomo wrote book it. must true. Win win Israel clear yet.LMAO Vaccines ALWAYS go trial runs lasts least year longer. *WE STILL TRIAL PERIOD.* moral obligation moron. leave name calling it.. article screams discrimination evangelicals guess expect see often. attack religious freedom attack I'm surprised people like calling others morons right choose whether wish part *HUMAN TRIAL* really strong stance accurate one. majority risk population vaccinated US. We‚Äôre gonna fine matter numbers next couple weeks make something nonsensical try attribute rational argument?

Yes. That's called strawman. Yes book rule. reality, Palestinian Authority longstanding rule never accepting Israeli aid. That's got vaccine Russia. Fauci et al communicating like lawyers.

More like scientists. like make statements stronger available evidence supports.

Communicating science general public incredibly difficult. Conveying right message without making unfounded claims (even though evidence pointing way already) skill own. amplified media ever hungry dramatic headline.

There many brilliant scientists rather poor science-communicators. get impression Fauci &amp; co OK communicators, certainly great. finding someone top field (like Fauci field infectious diseases) excels communicating general public like winning lottery. frustrating often portrayed black white issue. vaccines provide protection variants? Almost certainly. work well B.1.351 original Wuhan virus? Probably not, vaccines might greater fall-off others. simply give doses countries larger need

Bye-bye vaccines western countries. recall correctly, way prevent deaths world wide would've send vaccines poorer countries. successfully getting hidden?

Whether hiding something successful inconsequential fact attempt hide it. native Chinese people idea happened believe did, CCP really cares about. But... Beijing? Shanghai? major cities China international news agencies presence?

Members international press recalled lockdowns began. little coverage requests get Chinese government difficult granted pre-pandemic. no, single credible report past year except original outbreak city Wuhan entire province getting sealed off. Wuhan bustling like major Chinese cities btw.

Millions people traveling Wuhan period time know COVID actively spreading. know infected travelers cause thousands infections people within weeks arrival. Yet China's daily infection rates fared better New Zealand Australia - two far isolated countries universally accepted best containment response. sound you? even little bit? think Chinese even know first amendment is? risk dying covid, think Chinese people say ""my life, freedom"" wear masks, let alone partying inside conference hall?

The answer pretty simple. Chinese citizens discouraged talking pandemic regime currently fabricating stories push blame Wuhan global spread onto another country. Standard authoritarian behavior. Tbf can‚Äôt even begin imagine negotiations would look like something like this, I‚Äôd imagine it‚Äôs pretty difficult haha. get trying help kid ""see bright side,"" comments like actually helpful time. make people feel guilty feeling perfectly naturally feelings.

This person wants heard listened to. Hey OP, really sucks. Hopefully get early shot. I'm glad you! dream hope live reality soon enough, although things looking become better 3 months, ""resolved"" (meaning get vaccine) 1 year maybe. hell nationalize multi-national? Pfizer even office Israel? point people stop believing virus seasonal? Osterholm says Category 5 hurricane numbers higher winter surge!!! Even though 20+ percent Americans vaccinated Price, Netanyahu bombarding Pfizer phone calls, Pfizer CEO son holocaust survivors might helped skipping line. palestinian government Healthcare ministry tho, said deal providing vaccines Luckily world, far know actually pretty close. mostly seem related contamination labeling, serious side effect shown testing. labeled edible alcohol.

Not sure testing would change recall. talking motivating people essentially scaring punishments. said ""protected class"".

If saying ""race"" protected class, means everyone protected class.

Which means ""covid proselytizers"" protected class, destroyed argument. Worst year life *so far* [sometimes it‚Äôs Probably time they‚Äôll recognize Palestinian statehood. know many people becoming fully vaccinated day roughly US? Like percent doses given second doses day? well fitting quality mask better two crappy ones. would focus getting good KN95 comfortable rather wear two cloth surgical masks. would rather lived pandemic Florida places listed. infection risk, death? I'm trying understand vaccine actually starts fighting covid opposed cutting risk infection makes sense. tons vaccinations buy also lot infection, definitely overlap. curious safe severe outcomes recently vaccinated are. vaxx 1 week allow infection, help fighting infected 10 day, basically 0 protection illness(not infection)?

Understand may know answers, curious opinions. assume certain things known life long issues without lived whole life. losing arm. idea specifics referring though. 70% Americans vaccinated want get vaccinated according Pew polling, vaccine hesitancy consistently dropping time.

Just looking stats people *are* vaccine hesitant, seem like kind people who'd swayed MSNBC talking head Biden Administration ad campaign. There's going half million suicides year due anxiety covid precautions. feels hurt disapprove *perceived tone* article. **An article refuse read, btw.** gatekeeping actually kinda hilarious, underscores validity actually reported. 

Thank you. I'm millennial already got vaccine. Props you, fellow pro-vaxxer! Shit man, neglecting sorts things 80s taught me. think that's point. Like many states, Utah‚Äôs decline cases slowed. Utah hasn‚Äôt plateaued yet, seems headed there. Hopefully, enough citizens remain masked distanced get state vaccination period without sending case rates back up. Time tell. good lesson statistics, great example cant extrapolate unrepresentative friendship circle. 

People tend hang people similar socio-economically geographically.

Assuming college, probably mostly associate college educated peers, assume 95%+ favor vaccine. 

70% country go college, 20-30% even graduate high school. people different cultural values, probably associate almost none them. also make point trying make point. think understand strawman is.  Roaming drones detect vaccination status play least favourite music book one many people who've decided quit patronizing businesses operated unsafe manner become loyal businesses have. want get every year twice year knows. virus comes around got another shot gotta take twice year. strengthen natural immunity become dependent 50 injections year. Yes, think hesitating take vaccine. follow Jesus Bible. longer call evangelical Christian, politicized majority people calling become.  
The current vaccines went exact studies approved vaccines went through. every reason think current vaccines granted full approval. science behind vaccines work clear, mRNA vaccines used animals since 1990.  
Any theoretical risk vaccine extremely miniscule, compared real risk COVID. Aaaand doubled down. Good luck indeed. variants continue spread mutate, potentially vaccinated people, potentially posing danger everyone refuse vaccine. smart reopen schools sports population can‚Äôt vaccinated  Oh wow. Thanks explanation. I‚Äôm sure that, teens approved vaccine, US need millions more. 

In theory Germany enough doses vaccinate 60% whole population early July, large chunk population. depends J&amp;J deliveries moment. earth would think country world's draconian response measures trying hide virus?
Sure, they're lying positivity numbers optics locking city 11m people entirely worse optics. anybody know many masks wear? I‚Äôm currently sticking one might switch two think it‚Äôs better protection. wanted second opinion matter. ...and they‚Äôve *still* done alcohol. Yeah everyone knows numbers beginning wrong, completely understandable expected, also irrelevant discussion.

It's absolutely relevant. know virus spreads. 200,000 case month means completely uncontained freely spreading outbreak hands. China numbers now, would subject *entire country* Wuhan-style lockdown people bolted apartments. economic output reflect that. 

And there's common sense element. accept lied beginning, can't accept still lying now? think suddenly learned error ways never lie again? last link exactly covered it, fact quite opposite. outbreaks act hard fast rest country carries like normal.

Lol that's quite mental gymnastic performance going on. 

""China completely normal past pandemic except places experiencing pandemic."" 

 could say literally anywhere world.  right, everyone freaking slow back January we've really hit stride. seemed like people forgot production going constant, ever We're getting inflection point really quickly!

In rural areas already passed supply/demand inflection point. Big cities still tons demand crossing point weeks. think we'll hit around 5 million doses day peak towards end April fairly steady decline doses day throughout May.  Again, literally nothing says Emergency USA Authorization synonymous medical trials. Thank you. lmfao Yes. It‚Äôs one areas I‚Äôd support proof vaccination. empirical evidence trials. Vaccinated eople seem get COVID similar rates first 7-10 days post-vaccination. dramatic drop case rates occurs ~10 days onward mRNA vaccines. Prior then, effect small. seen data deaths infections time frame, safest assumption next day vulnerable someone unvaccinated. science? complete proponent vaccine. saying. got minute became available me. made sure parents vaccinated.... drove 5 hours round trip get day 1. made husband come work car day. science wrong??? excellent; read title again. tough conceptualize. Like someone got first shot, 1 week later get exposed, say take week effects virus, 2 weeks sick, vaxx starts working ok? many people getting vaccinated also many getting infected overlap, wondering people actually safe bad effects covid(not safe infection). think forgetting calories like, really tasty Education encouragement acceptance everyone convinced. punishment approach going harden resistance among anti vax. counter productive eventually end place either increase punishments (which leads dark place) accept everyone going get vaccine. anyone 65 Bay Area hasn‚Äôt got vaccine that‚Äôs haven‚Äôt signed don‚Äôt want to.

Help sign then. I‚Äôve signed 20 people Bay Area. Tons appts. Hmmmm anxiety disorder leads suicidal ideation even potential death... won‚Äôt pretend understand lot stuff it‚Äôs becoming increasingly obvious pessimistic us also understand either.  Every governor done things make us scratch heads. One problem everyone opinion can‚Äôt open, usually that‚Äôs based financial interest political bent (which truly f‚Äôd up).

The worthy lockdown one keeps many people home/isolated possible. that‚Äôs done longer spell start. 

But ship sailed.

Add nutjob militias would-be Whitmer assassins MI, quite brew. extremely minuscule cases clotting AZN vaccine caused EU put temporary ban them, putting ban Pfizer &amp; Moderna linked issues?

Truth is, none ‚Äúissues‚Äù genuinely even CLOSE eye raising. incredibly obvious playing politics vaccines, people believing it. **From another article**: two ways get vaccine greenlighted FDA: Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) applying license Biologics License Application (BLA).

‚ÄúThe difference really emergency use licensure volunteers observed longer period time see duration protection, might rare adverse events occurred road,"" Dr. Schaffner said.¬†

In layman's terms, Dr. Monto said, follow-up period complete vaccination typically longer considering full 23%? That‚Äôs better would expected! don‚Äôt believe accurate. Cant find link currently saw clotting naturally occurring 5 per million per year normally much higher represented vaccinated group. something would outweigh benefit population level also reasonable vaccinate elderly higher risk. don‚Äôt everyone gets vaccinated ant antivaxxers get themselves. saying dumb people like BA History would basically different virus that's part family evade cells vaccines? going tinfoil hat, pointing China ever honest something? Good, don‚Äôt need it. Haven‚Äôt flu shot years too. Good diet exercise enough medicine irrelevant me

No, belligerent refusal understand actual science absolutely relevant. fact think it‚Äôs irrelevant *because doesn‚Äôt fit worldview* problem. That‚Äôs straight-up cognitive dissonance.  jealous hearing Americans talk vaccinations restrictions dropping. Ontario hope ""very good summer"" officials vaguely hinting weeks ago quickly fading soaring case counts... point I'm totally depressed burnt out, surprised ""summer 2020"" closest normal we're going get least next year. Uh. work 16 hours day sleep? Or, maybe, maybe, anti lockdown sensible course action, utter codswallop. 

We've finished vaccinating groups 1-9 (well, likely tomorrow have). 22 days first dose, [AZ vaccine 100% effective preventing Groups 1-9 make 98-99% mortality risk.

 We've 127,000 deaths 1/5 population covid. translates 508k deaths everyone caught covid without vaccination. 508,000 - 99% = 5080 deaths, less flu season, absolutely everyone caught covid, obviously happen due herd immunity we're close to.

If anti lockdown now, understand statistics. turning r/coronavirusuk echo chamber stupid realise truth. brigading, people's minds change. Refrigeration There's lot reason doubt. German government EU large completely messed vaccine rollout busy trying blame someone else fix it. 

But America well ahead schedule exports Europe going ramp soon. Yeah everyone knows numbers beginning wrong, completely understandable expected, also irrelevant discussion.

And last link exactly covered it, fact quite opposite. outbreaks act hard fast rest country carries like normal.

So guess that's evidence severe outbreaks hidden now. playing side majority countries average age death 80+ lot deaths occurred people locked long term care homes nearly 0 quality life kept alive modern medicine. 

After seeing facilities people inside heart breaks. don‚Äôt allow animals suffer state people. I‚Äôve made intentions clear family time comes me, need make difficult decision give peace that‚Äôs point. see relative reduction cases seasonality. currently entering 4th wave around world simply link seasonality 4th wave. fact, it‚Äôs defying seasonality. 

Just 3rd wave pandemic loosely coincided beginning typical flu season North America absolutely nothing explain surge occurred Southern Hemisphere exact time. ignoring Southern Hemisphere? see alot news dramatically small amount people.

..and think that's case America?

Pretty sure fact roughly amount people died UK America shows situation pretty comparable amongst two nations. examples we've seen offered Europe literally include photo name

I'm sure effective would otherwise. could give boy Joey Doughnut vaccine record input vaccine passport. CDC card day dosage along lot number vaccine given.  speak young people daily. 

You‚Äôre correct. want adults give space process this. friends. Aka mental health support. Maybe think mean therapy. assure , mental health support vast array. take two weeks get adaptive immune system (T-cells B-cells) running particular antigen. probably non-specific innate immune activation next day, hence sore arm nauseous feelings people report. probably nothing active key virus specifically. Yeah, think we're past point *most* people trying hard find first dose found one. Especially they're willing able drive hours. rather selfless COVID, right? comes flu, people generally care taking precautions bare minimum getting vaccinated. can't stop trying. 

You build hospitals thousands patients 5 days numbers China reports. Yeah definitely swing positive way. fall age group. first Pfizer, 2 weeks go back second. circles I‚Äôve heard many people going ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt take it‚Äù ‚ÄúI will‚Äù I‚Äôve never heard opposite. don‚Äôt know anyone going take since changed mind. It‚Äôs encouraging could happy 70% population going get vaccinated. done continue focus education hopefully get 20 25% want vaccine take it. going force people dead set vaccine get it. Denying health insurance 10 20 percent population going make things better. accurate say 'most folk UK wear one get it'. Seems like people whining freedom masks number countries, including England. always single digit % folk want vaccine, whatever reason. Realistically, we're going get come around shot, matter what.

Where need focus time: rest people ""mildly reluctant"". 

Who ""mildly reluctant""? Individuals want make appointments, want come back second, generally want much bothered change schedule(s) around getting shot. We're quickly approaching general availability: shoppers location longer requires appointment, form reward (coupon, gift cert), we'll see bit reluctance disappear. alluded discussion before, think disappointing thing last month failure CDC mainstream media pivot focus ‚Äúmasking, distancing, variant concern‚Äù ‚Äúget motherfucking vaccine , work variants literally matter big picture (from data far)‚Äù. Recent headlines along Dr. Osterholms recent comments literally made pissed. 

i get it, PR person able recognize huge portion country exhausted masks distancing stuff would way unifying productive plaster pro vaccine messages every billboard, every headline, every fucking word CDC officials say next months. 

I think saw comment days ago saying ‚Äúno one believes people want go forever , building straw man arguing it‚Äù. hope agree yes. , Dr Fuck Ever signaling doom national television still see people actively worrying states like Michigan, would truly believed vaccines would work? actively ignore fact majority country downtrend vaccinating millions people per day something almost 100 percent (!!!) guaranteed prevent serious illness?

I guess I‚Äôm failing understand perspective people. keep eye Michigan? Yes. things going good could get US considering 6 months ago, yet people want cling tiny details big picture flies right heads. Take deep breathe relax, almost there. He‚Äôs always catastrophist, seems like he‚Äôs recently totally lost it. get people different opinions it‚Äôs yet means, predictions seem totally touch reality point. Nope. Paywall. irrelevant me. don‚Äôt display flawed logic. I‚Äôm side people choosing get vaccine. I‚Äôm saying way media spins different groups isn‚Äôt helping. opinions run deep... appalled many politicians like Newsom Cuomo acting like vaccine wasn‚Äôt necessarily going safe fed government. Harris also injected doubt initially/. Trump always favor vaccine.  vaccine politicized beginning. dems lot culpability that. Pfizer requesting EUA 12-15 year gave 600 kids, serious side die &amp; variants continue mutate outwit vaccine wait another year full approval. We‚Äôre getting EUA‚Äôs only.

Guess you‚Äôve chosen keep kids home; prerogative. experts created equal. I'll listen expert literally wrote textbook worried virus going out-evolve vaccines. People looking wrong way. People looking antibodies. People say, ‚Äúah, variants less susceptible antibodies. But, know what? ignoring cells. turns out, none variants changes would impact ability cells kill infected cell. Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) - Get Report vaccine turns 100% effective preventing hospitalizations deaths South Africa‚Ä¶. saw article today showed U.K. variant ... made difference outbreak U.K. made difference. people know, worrying vaccines going compromised variant. That‚Äôs say totally fine, really similar. Please stop spreading disinformation, dude. Literally nothing substantiates anything you‚Äôre claiming, regardless opinion matter. Oh, link? I'd like include big comment thing. order farmers pay wages US labor table, food prices would probably quadruple.

People vastly underestimate labor intensive farming is. Exactly. can‚Äôt hide virus I've heard sub, sounds like US past point outside urban areas? that, there's perhaps near majority regulars daily threads anti-mitigation want everything back pre-pandemic *immediately* really going way back started. Obviously next couple months we'll back pre-pandemic we're still transition phase. negative news, concerns anything welcome. ""I got shot last week now, open everything back up, want hear anything else I'll keep coming sub multiple times day make sure people say want hear."" don‚Äòt think decision much impact US could help accelerate rollout elsewhere J&amp;J takes one shot distributed less effort. There's REASON APPLY EMERGENCY USE APPROVAL. I've got news you.... **You trial.** actually deluded lmao see lot banned ages ago, sensible you. really can't see ***huge*** impingement civil liberties precedent sets need get Specsavers. 

Not mention, vaccine passports make sense they're truly going used everyone's offered vaccine, herd immunity then.  [They're still building massive emergency sure, nothing see here. Wouldn‚Äôt logical provide evidence hat seasonal? 

It‚Äôs pretty easy look around see case, hospitalizations deaths around world past year able draw conclusion seasonal. one four waves (currently wave #4) pandemic loosely coincided typical flu cold season. Even wave occurred would summer months Southern Hemisphere. 

The studies concluded sort seasonality cherry-picking. screw around - pay get shot! Wait vaccines supply excess, offer another round stimulus payments unvaccinated people get immunized, plus extra $ kid.  Tonsils nostril, normal tests. That's I'm getting at, indeed. vaccines, everywhere term ""evangelical"" used pejoratively refer nebulous group people tend differing opinions various topics (not think particular matter opinion, digress). like boogeyman Reddit, like see certain circles mention lest automod haunts dreams. would figure Ford would good getting drugs people. idea people bike commuting. show work hot sweaty change clothes shower work actually get desk. sounds horrible me. isn't, full shit. I'm millennial (mid late 20s) maybe region friends' general political affiliation think know anyone age want get vaccine; may already have. experience, boomer age around boomer generation skeptical vaccine. know anecdotal experience political divide vaccines, sadly surprising, probably even age divide. young healthy, there‚Äôs reason get J&amp;J one, unless work healthcare elderly care something june, half master education half arsed zoom bullshit absolutely real lectures, labs contacts academics class mates apparently deadly. 

I also lost ridiculous amount income even want start calculating pointless see much fucked can't anything it.

It also happy summer social paranoia boomers vaccine passports roam around world.

Very comfortable say ""it fine, June two months away"". like ""two weeks flatten curve"" one year ago. drowning wine. Well, Jens Spahn! said 20% early May, really blame people even lower expectations? people 20s even getting it? Like know leftovers, otherwise perspective like trying poke brick wall ten feet thick knocking it. Like underhanded jerk questionable things get one earlier most, hear many people early age groups casually throwing around got like nothing I'm sitting like.... *how*... \^ folks echo chamber mods views (he's mod there)

Much reasons typical anti-vaccine reasons: metals it, know happen 5 years, ""I'm 'organic non pharma' person"". reasoning hold scrutiny ultimately lands fallback position ""It's choice respect that"". 

I know get stubborn ignorant attitude. Even presented facts, often responds ""well, that's opinion"". like trying reason brick. 

What do? Worry lasting forever US 65-75% fully vaccinated. 

Right now, less 30% adults fully vaccinated. USA case count going due laxing rules complacency. way college going allow people show without masks social distancing even allow vaccinated people back. optics + tiny chance people still getting crowded room vaccine 90% effective.

I find extremely hard believe, given quickly US vaccinating thus far. I'd imagine supply outpace demand country May, anyone wants vaccine able get least one dose May.

Yeah, admitted nothing happen June. ""Very tough months"" rising infections, hospitalizations, social apartheid vaccine passports. allowed criticize EU need wait becomes North Korea? people CDC lose jobs handled poorly. What's point getting vaccinated can't normal things? need talk normal things getting vaccinated people motivated get shot. got second shot husband first.

B.1.351 [isn't scary thought robust Seem Reduce Spread**

Vaccination previous infection[ reduce viral load, reduces article good job explaining likelihood vaccines *at least* reducing spread. [This may help too. Data [Scotland looks 

[""Moderna vaccine blocks (87-93%) infections &amp; 91% (89-94%) cases, especially asymptomatic cases [are worse 

Looks like amount virus people who've gotten one dose Pfizer vaccine infected [greatly reduced compared great reduction ability spread virus. [Maybe even one [get doses rare, studies show [less 1 (maybe 1 10,000 range, read study, awesome). Reinfections tend much milder previous infections, even new variants. Check [comments really interesting discussion regarding reinfection. Especially top comment thread. **Can vaccinated people spread virus?**

Any answer get either ""yes"" ""no"" 100% correct, (though may changing soon!). now, ""probably not, looks like vaccinated people transmit virus, can't ever transmit it"". best [""it's really *really* Getting less likely day.

Can vaccinated people get infected? Yes, sometimes, lot less likely unvaccinated people. 

Is big deal do? No. Cases people vaccinated much milder.

Even variants? point, breakthrough infection one variant vaccinated people.

Also, notice reputable person talking subject always says ""may able spread"", ""maybe"", ""we know if"". that's small chance vaccinated people able spread virus. big chance. Doctors, scientists, regulators careful language subject, would argue they're careful. said, say ""vaccinated people cannot spread virus"", find situations vaccinated people spread virus, [that would end worse experts hedge least me, way experts framing seems pretty reasonable, put shoes.

That said, seem [saying I've 

Stay, strong, get lazy staying safe, [you'll regret Thoughts/Cool Stuff**

Even shittiest masks seem work, [but Positivity Rate: said lot subs positivity rate go time people vaccinated require testing. Last year, *the* metric watch, likely wane quickly importance overall testing drops. necessarily worry sudden high positivity rates, mass testing likely drop pretty quickly, particularly testing sites converted vaccination sites. 

We may want use newly found testing sequencing capacity test sequence higher proportion flu samples. might give us head start flu genetics circulating, help eliminate flu two. We're single digits flu cases places, awesome! likely cheaper vaccine made redditor.

[Delayed second doses might least though evidence mRNA vaccine trials suggest 6 weeks better least acceptable. problem wait longer second dose, therefore, full protection. says maximum interval doses, [Pfizer says 6 

[A happy may prevent severe [mRNA vaccines 100% SA variant, *doesn't* [mean we'll definitely need like [thegracefuldork's prediction vaccine previous prediction. ""rosier"", better.

When someone asks favorite beer is, answer always same.

It's one front me.

So get first vaccine can, differences pretty vaccines reduce infections, someone gets infection getting vaccinated, fewer reduced symptoms. currently seems also true post vaccination infection known variants. pretty sure reduction indication they'll reduce spread. Why? We're pretty sure reduce spread people truly asymptomatic barely spread virus, people mild symptoms spread slightly more, people go develop severe symptoms spread virus really well. 

In words: reduction symptoms least correlated reduction ability spread virus. Vaccines reduce symptomatic infections symptoms get infected. Therefore, vaccines reduce spread.


Tips clarifying terms/language/understanding appreciated. miss something could help people? Please let know!

NYT [some good fact, [they *

More [good news goodness. like read comments something... side effects vaccine:

Nobody saying side effects. clearly side effects. I'm even saying side effects vaccine could last years. effects infection may show while, [and know last long notably loss sense smell.

I'm saying we'd find side effects within months. side effects suddenly show six months vaccination already shown people.

If example side effect vaccine side effects seen within first four months suddenly found four months post-vaccination, I'd change wording post.

I'll tell though, I've still gotten example vaccine side effect show least people way vaccine administered.

I get plenty ""look, vaccine used decades ago tiny country rarely causes one long-term side effect, wrong"", address point I'm making. Ty sharing, great news! New goalposts: end lockdown everyone earth vaccinated simultaneously That's what's going Ukraine. half population going refuse vaccination, citing religious beliefs conspiracy-laden BS found internet.

Hell, GF caught Covid (luckily, complications), mother adamant simple viral bronchitis, refused get mask came visit her, tried ""cure"" mixture lemon, garlic honey. Germans fucking stupid. believe pace won‚Äôt change all. ramp all. vaccine amount people everyday. lol

They don‚Äôt get Germany gets April alone amount vaccines whole year far. people stupid af. introvert think something else play. once-in-a-lifetime pandemic change rules suddenly life got much easier introverts much harder extroverts. getting end societal change introverts deal lives get harder again.

Imagine inverted pandemic, disease forced people stay home scientists invented medicine could let everyone go would work 1-2 years. Suddenly, extrovert, go town, fun, things love do, find life much better. would feel medication starts wear world returns everyone staying home, probably great.

I think best outcome wouldn‚Äôt us devolve normal tribalism argue better, introverted extroverted, dunk other. Instead, could recognize constitutes fulfilling, happy life different different people strive build society people happy.

For introverts pandemic, seemed difficult wrap heads around heck difficult extroverts. asked stay home, watch Netflix, read book, get hobby, etc. Things introverts generally find pleasant somehow tortuous extroverted friends.

As head back extroverted society, extroverts scratching heads introverted friends unhappy. come drink, go club dance, night bowling alley (I‚Äôm reaching here, reminder, I‚Äôm introvert, I‚Äôm sorta imaging extroverts miss doing).  shoe foot, extroverts may feel inclined dunk introverts things return normal. recall pre-pandemic plenty times forced situations didn‚Äôt like ‚Äúnormal‚Äù go super loud bar declined dunked on, nicely, extroverted peers.

So let‚Äôs take moment differences display, instead meeting derision hatred, reach compassion understanding. Realize introverts, society returning difficult year you‚Äôve spent. Let‚Äôs work together extroverts fulfilling life things love introverts too. world recognize, celebrate, support other‚Äôs differences beautiful vibrant world, one want live in. saves -one- life justified surely. impact people, care. means weaker herd immunity importantly short term, still get sick require hospitalisation. happened Chile. 40% partially vaccinated, ICU capacity reached 95% filling young middle-aged people.

So affected sure. much wider impact. ever seen statistics people losing substantial amount weight keeping off? 95% fail that.

Seems willpower shot snake oil sold quacks. developed anxiety disorder beginning this. pandemic cause it? No....it brewing years. pandemic concentrated everything together tidy way. say cause many others though. times extraordinary. 


I'm glad I'd gotten help needed fairly quickly. I'm well. Facing fears balancing practical. feeding disorder. Eating well, sleeping well. probably streamline vaccines system 4 weeks. It‚Äôs really big deal FDA approved Pfizer one 3 weeks yeah..... hand, lost 20+ lbs last year eating shelf stable goods making meals instead eating fast food daily lunch work, lazy dine-out dinners nights.

My movement level probably dropped 20%, exercise, I'm certain salt fat intake plummeted probably shaved least half daily calories average, cooking home... Though time baking ü•≤ surprises me, friend mine Dallas said waiting too. heard lot side effects want shot one done. know are, know blocked I'll never see comments ever again. Country country data hard get apples apples. know USA dropped ball, don‚Äôt know many worse.

I interested state state comparisons study. data points break conventional thinking.  caused acute short-term stress, really disorder?

I call running life grizzly bear ""panic attack"". apparently college considering making vaccine mandatory. Good. Glad hear that. Here‚Äôs kicker... even mandatory vaccination status campus likely social distancing masking requirements. Reduced classroom sizes again, distancing high traffic buildings, testing every two weeks masks anywhere inside. Basically business usual, even vaccine. end? going enough people? Every human campus vaccinated still want enforce restrictions? 

I know might optics thing right now, can‚Äôt help wonder institutions dragging feet next 2-3 years. I‚Äôm anxious places sacrifice mental health thousands save fluke mild cases Covid fall. many people beating drum type approach almost makes wonder I‚Äôm crazy thinking it‚Äôs insanity.

Greece. booking appointments, gap anywhere 20 30 days. virologist, basically flu mutates much rapidly COVID, susceptible antigenic shift. also sort of... that, least probably sense thinking. Chances everytime flu since childhood body idea fight it. H1N1 popped 2009 older people relatively immune previous flu shots illness similar influenza strains. Obviously prevent older people getting it, enough immunity huge deal.

Same COVID/variants. might still get COVID point, might variants vaccines prevent all. However, chances actual infection blunted compared getting COVID year completely naive.

It's also good reason get flu shot every year. Think building immunity building repertoire tools similar infections, 1 1 correlation exact bug. Getting flu shot consistently build diverse set cell responses common influenza antigens. flu shot last year probably prevent getting flu year, misjudge strain current year, previous injection might blunt worst effects illness. things get sick deal we've always done

""the way we've always done"" really great begin with. America unhealthy society, health care gobbling 17% GDP even pandemic, access healthcare inequitable, easy anyone externalize cost bad health decisions.

A COVID hospitalization costs average $70,000. That's 5 years pay federal minimum wage job. person long-term lung heart damage, much cost? factor lost productivity, etc. ""we society"" pay this? There's great economic case trying keep COVID infections low possible reach herd immunity, decide play (make someone else) pay later.

As aside, first year got flu. That's week year miserably sick, miss several days work. Also, 50,000 people die flu weeks hospitalization, many need intensive care recover, I'm going pay health insurance premiums taxes Medicare. change ""normal"" lives justifies keeping things way?

You might complain ""moving goalposts"" actually goalposts, there's consequences actions. able offload consequences actions onto enough people, enough time, looks consequences all. Yes definitely. mask gives sense anonymity really enjoy. Also, someone enjoys weed get little paranoid overly self-conscious, mask made much easier go public high. made feel invisible liked that. don't.

Probably cos 1 vaccine used other. ‚Äú said work cafeteria worker location one technically business ‚Äú authoritarian regimes come power. make sure infect people...? efficacy numbers comparable different timing different cohorts. know lot 20 30-something want J&amp;J one dose done. 25 35 chances remote hospitalized covid. convenience. 20-somethings convenience &amp; availability paramount.  still see comment. experience exactly same. mobile. switch location services off. use public WiFi. use variety VPNs.

But phones good argument. think person conflating adenovirus-vectored vaccines, might valid concern (though nobody certain yet). that's issue though, rumors began spreading ""but actually"" people since mutates time, people supposedly unreasonable think mutations could lead variants concern. wholly inappropriate. imo whole messaging ""don't panic"" *comparatively* low-risk contexts time short-sighted people really needed rank risks, dismiss them. Even worthy panic, still needed acknowledged people wonder later know it. Helps stop conspiracy theorists pretend confused ""changing"" facts. argumentative, really. honestly asking ""kind"" tone (hard text)

School spread went fast Meanwhile Canada government decided would 16 weeks doses.  clots stay body understood month's vaccine could simply reveal problems rather causing them, seriously look past medicine use health vaccinating avoid risk checkup vaccinating people may problems vaccine, altho probably simple right now.  It‚Äôs possible that‚Äôs played role, community insular risk outside. Look image entitled 'Mutations deletions spike protein' already date week give idea.. vaccine hub I, 2 friends received Pfizer doses automatically scheduled us 4 weeks well. I‚Äôm waitlist earlier booster sweating difference 3 4 weeks doesn‚Äôt seem problem I‚Äôve read Recently LFT tests free unlimited (and specifically asymptomatic, say symptomatic went PCR) go test center, order tests home I‚Äôm downvoting it‚Äôs anti America little rant zero relevance topic hand Same, I've shots coming weekend, hit window considered fully vaccinated. still mask asked still keep hands washed (because kind thing pre-pandemic anyway). However, go back seeing friends regular basis, going concerts, eating out, etc. problem analogy bunch kids taking classes taught years hand. kid 1.9, currently ~3 class, basically every student sitting 0.0, like: ""you dumbass, get 4.0?"" would like ""what hell wrong school?""

Rolling vaccine speed never, ever done before. polio vaccine rollout took years. GUYS booked vacation! I'm going Colorado August visit family members seen good year. absolutely hate flying I'm excited go somewhere! completely healthy/asymptomatic testing positive would cause family put house arrest 2 weeks, incentive anyone that? US could go get tested every day free sure would want known exposure feel sick. Oh absolutely mean goalpost moving. much easier sell restrictions grounds ""but children!!"" making heads explode Reddit today. love end May every adult wanted 2nd dose deaths time low awhile. really see going make people wait another month. Masks businesses probably continue bit. Thanks! see logic. Yeah total agreement good distinction part. Yeah what‚Äôs problem stigmatized people ?  I've getting messaging like neck woods I'm going lie briefly made want vaccine all. Why? eligible yet, despite desperately wanting it, told something greater good made angry.

That said, I'm getting first round mRNA 23 hours 30 minutes believe I'm team Push Face. I'm game messaging place moment anyone walk pharmacy vaccination site freely get dose. know, either. feel them, definitely, considering small percentage people be, think need adjust lifestyle answers. makes sense instead everyone adjusting lifestyle (which never happen anyway). vary region region. control Spring Surge get case levels UK, easily see states safely re-opening June. dense populous states tons tourists &amp; travelers going super hard stomp virus since there's much mixing ppl coming across country around world. Real normalcy come late fall kids vaccinated. course areas restrictions loosened feel secure enough socialize (bar-hopping, clubbing, dining, karaoke whatever). Random news events stress much used to. Everything feels much like end world used to.  yeah makes wonder different special J&amp;J vaccine means one dose. Cause moment, seems like normal vaccine except bother testing 2 doses sake speed giving USP. 
 
There's currently trials ongoing test 2 doses J&amp;J, suspect find effective, like every vaccine, become new norm it. Thanks! Yes, temporary thing injury, really long-term. I'll certainly skip second shot. Isnt ESTA essentially VISA waiver? someone case covid would go ""mild"" official records, holy shit world difference ""not real danger dying"" ""just rub dirt it."" Weeks extreme fatigue, months mild brain fog, months reduced physical capabilities. still mild never got pneumonia never reduced respiratory function, easily sickest I've ever life, fucking never ends. may also referring anti-PEG antibodies, though I'm far knowledgeable enough know whether there's notable difference PEG formulations used two mRNA vaccines. 

In either case, obviously know mRNA vaccines working well two doses. I've read seems indicate anti-PEG antibodies may become issue long-term use therapeutics. Considering PEG vaccines help get mRNA past cell walls intermuscular injection site goal circulating body, likelihood antibodies PEG large impact mRNA uptake seems unlikely, someone knowledgeable could definitely chime in. Also mention according dutch news 5 cases thromboses thrombocytopenia (all women), 2 5 patients antibodies found ‚Äúmatch HIT-like picture‚Äù. (Ie anti-PF4) clear yet three (in dutch)

 German Griefswald study 9 patients found couple prior autoimmune coagulation disorders, autoimmune conditions like SLE APS high incidence thrombocyteopenia *and* give false positive HIT. would really helpful know specific information patients, whether taking specific medication, like aspirin, birth control etc, covid status 

Hopefully EMA review due conclude several days shed light. US maybe week behind rapidly catching up! Nearly every state country 16 completely open vaccinating 3-4 million per day. I'm well aware that. approved fall least.  isn‚Äôt early though. great resource Everest use Alan Annette [Alan Annette blog oops. thought meant early season early pandemic. CDC updated estimate, think, end 2020 estimated 25% US population already infected. 35% pretty safe assumption now. bad news. Therefore, ignored. otherwise immune system may get fixated delivery system rather spike


What mean? mRNA vaccines, issue protecting/getting mRNA cell replication occur. delivery mechanism, either vaccine, compromised degree 1st shot? get this? actually pretty high, terms % total population eventually vaccinated. least 25% adult population refuse vaccine (we're seeing 65+ numbers level sharply right now, think they'll get 80% vaccinated). add &lt;16 crowd might even authorized vaccines year, might see &lt; 60% total population vaccinated dust finally settles.

I think that's totally fine, mean we'll likely always widespread community transmission (though low severity), even say anything transmission visitors country, COVID-19 likely rampant nuisance years.

I say need set realistic expectations build plans accordingly. COVID-19 perpetual nuisance (and be), role govt want going forward? desperately need conversations future realistically looks like. comment linking thesun.co.uk automatically removed source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

People love leave part out. one questioning efficacy masks. Otherwise would say medical professionals need them? 

They said largely aren‚Äôt necessary isn‚Äôt widespread community spread. Probably within another 24-48 hours. longest heard 3 days. *Phil Scott

Rick Scott another beast entirely. mean terms vaccine side effects? understand, mostly depends immune system. Healthy younger people good immune systems will, average, experience stronger side effects. Getting side effects actually good sign, means body responding building appropriate resistance.  Great news That's absolutely messaged bud. *know* that's meant, many people not. like *know* we'll likely get back normal long herd immunity. Pretty sure also know though.. confirm true. Florida wear mask airplanes grocery store. imagine grocery stores drop mandates May. Kids still wearing masks school (with vaccines kids support this!). Life back normal feels great! think people unreasonable? past six months, one promise that‚Äôs kept hair salons able open March. Everything else lot talk zero action follow through. perhaps data declared public? Even beyond people need told selfish people r/collapse disappointed People need learn can‚Äôt compare efficacy rates didn‚Äôt use baseline. J&amp;J vaccine trial occurred later last year biggest case surge happening whereas vaccine trials earlier year chances participants interacting infected people many times lower. Also elder millennial - social circle already least first shot. soon ""group 1C"" including adults medical conditions work essential jobs opened vaccines nearly anyone (seriously, adds like 70% adult population falling one conditions/jobs) signed up, many us driving 1-2 hours rural areas they're available. plenty teacher/health care worker friends who'd already too. 21st June everything UK back fairly normal. Well normal things going be.

Pretty sure July people able travel places fairly well. can't see reason people able travel Gibraltar, Seychelles, Falkland Islands, Israel, Bhutan, Saint Helena, Cayman Islands, Isle Man, Jersey, Guernsey, Chile, Bermuda, United Arab Emirates United States restrictions. Well apart maybe needing visa's.

Hey US might good time lift VISAs UK residences. lot need one come need one go there? I'm grading curve. There's zero reason US comparing countries like Brazil Peru domestic pharma capacity.

If kid comes home college 1.9 GPA, pretend resounding success 40% Americans (and even higher percentage human beings general) attend college all. People definitely depressed pandemic r/rimjob_steve downvote people. Sure, protect kids see fit, statement still holds true facts: Scary think people take care us kids grandkids getting old. want dumb people run show!! asked whether people okay discrimination someone responded implying felt current discrimination law sufficient. Since seem know much discrimination law, contributed know.

As argument, point customer vaccinated customer wearing campaign t-shirt. discrimination someone based ideology members ideology vaccinated unvaccinated. Plus, whether businesses able ""do whatever want"" certain customers. opposite, whether businesses able refuse certain would-be customers, choosing nothing them.

But get point questions you. 

* think businesses ever able refuse customers able pay goods/services available? 

* yes, circumstances refused (eg think people pets, lit cigarettes, shirt prohibited, makes prohibitable)?

* business' rights change interaction customers takes place on/in property owned business (ie different business homeowner defining trespassers)?

* business allowed discriminate customers way (eg offering discounts members loyalty program)? vaccines like condoms masks like pull method, got  Makes really hard implement vaccine passports. agree, communications oriented towards people getting vaccinated staying safe rather informing actual science. never say anything anyone interpret letting guard down.  Difference group would banned entry month vaccine. Would ok businesses lock people yet eligible get vaccinated? Opening one hour early trying make silly comparison won‚Äôt stay home three days concern. saying won‚Äôt follow rules plenty people failed quarantine. Also certificate piece heavy paper. It‚Äôs easy forge. Lockdowns prevent health systems overwhelmed reduce chance emergence spread new variants.

In countries without strict border control, lockdowns always buying time vaccines. Europe hit highly contagious B117 variant found UK caused UK's near disaster January (after circulating months moderate social distancing restrictions) UK still high level restrictions introduced early January. Bobby boy: A: you‚Äôre lying B: don‚Äôt care tell people job is, earlier statement still wrong. There's essentially correlation government restrictions case curves, scale (city, state, country, region). Never been. correlated actual behavior case curves. What's going here, suspect, mask mandate Texas (and Florida matter) never really complied extensively, mandate reversed change lot terms people's behavior. hand, people start throw caution wind NY, NJ, MI, elsewhere, behavior changing dramatically. course not!

These rules place them. Silly. US absurdly lopsided Covid response. Socially, it‚Äôs disaster. Americans couldn‚Äôt even agree masks lots people died. worst social cohesion major nation. Yet, able develop, manufacture, give vaccines record pace. Potentially dangerous variants arise vacuum. think removing restrictions vaccines available means variants, potentially threat vaccine effectiveness, disappear mutations end transmissions actually still rising? scientist right mind would ever agree that. mean goal posts keep moving?

The way goal posts moving recently things getting back normal sooner rather later. pretty rough Houston well. Dallas bad bad border cities. really hit Hispanic population hard overall I've seen people sub asserting reason two doses regimen simply big pharma cash money. Unfortunately kidding. TBH mask use seems remained unchanged around I‚Äôm TX. 

Most people still masked. Selfish holes still flout signs businesses requiring mask. 

Basically business usual it‚Äôs since forever. 

Which I‚Äôm pleasantly surprised at. didn‚Äôt expect massive surge, also thought things wouldn‚Äôt continue correct direction either. say fully vaccinated implication waited vaccine full effect, get point. follow cdc guidelines things eventually get better. Appointment Wednesday. know multiple people got Covid week shot. course girlfriend ‚Äúwould really like I‚Äôd come shopping family.‚Äù don‚Äôt wanna get damn virus last moment.  would nice see government leaders work together GOP leadership encourage everyone get vaccinated, including republicans.

I seen government make good targeted efforts go minority neighborhoods bring vaccination clinics trusted members communities involved messaging encourage people communities get vaccinated. includes african American Hispanic neighborhoods.

It would good see type government outreach happening Republican areas well. benefit people vaccinated. Yeah, coming end June 21st never ever think on. /s [CDC Science contains references multiple studies showing ~90% effectiveness infection including asymptomatic, illness death.

You've made common error - science medicine absolute statements like ""this vaccine prevents transmission"" made published work public health recommendations solid empirical evidence show true. say ""we know"" mean ""we proven it."" took ""I know"" erroneously made conclusive statement opposite direction said ""The vaccine still helps YOU. one else."" know prevents transmission, mean DOESN'T. also mean equally likely doesn't. always reason expect vaccines would level effectiveness transmission, question strong protection would be. That's starting answered - strong. We're yet. Vaccine demand continues exceed supply country. get same-day appointment every city country walk in, that's campaign start. mean that's kinda true though, it?

Do create two-tiered society based vaccine access, especially since breaks along income, educational, racial lines. everyone vaccine... what's point? Instead setting precedent handing health information random pub owner standard, keep we're require vaccines employment school travel?

It works fine less blatantly invasive. want get locked society phone died one night. Thank much!! % population needs vaccinated hit herd immunity? fact vaccines highly effective something grateful for, even huge swath idiots refusing - 75%-80% population vaccinated might enough. U.K. showing major evidence among school aged children point? bizarre U.K. variant gets press fear mongering coverage U.S. seems U.K. itself. Currently, continued doomsday reporting U.S. seems disproven U.K. Israel. U.S. media acts countries exist unless need example fit specific narrative (eyeballss/clicks=$$$). sometimes feel like I'm living Twilight Zone I've become extremely exhausted news almost source. like Guardian. Atlantic. others, part, feels like everything geared towards search journalistic truth, towards pushing buttons make $. course true... mean still depressing. can‚Äôt post link bots remove LOT stuff google ‚Äúdevil‚Äù ‚Äúvariant‚Äù you‚Äôll see it‚Äôs California one. turned nothing. Ahh gotcha. Yeah, mean I'm saying mentally fucked people--it's catastrophe course did. musing reasons might people therapy. pandemic, insurance cover telehealth therapy, does--but maybe that's relevant examples either. banned discord months ago saying bad flu season. One ""doctors"" saying going worst ever, lmao probably discriminatory decide is. Though vaccinated young people, Healthcare workers vaccination program volunteers. like saying supermarkets opening one hour early elderly/at risk customers discriminatory. Well, unfortunately fellow Canadian‚Äôs - long continue leaders blindly listen experts, get used face coverings start shopping real estate US.

Any Texans looking roommate ? health unit pretty proactive actually know qualified since push messaging 80y/o conditions like Syndrome Cancer within past years, among conditions. sign guess. Glad lose weight since I'm barely 40BMI limit losing 70lb last year.

If get it'll big weight off, especially student. I'd wait Wednesday Thursday. Didn‚Äôt realize guys needed anything come US. That‚Äôs bs. funny sad way people acting like missing week makes big difference. 

Mine Walgreens is/was 4 weeks apart (second dose later 2 day). reason ever wear mask store ‚Äúmasks required‚Äù sign. Even then, get fast can.

Otherwise I‚Äôm really anywhere requires them. (Except work... 100% vaccinated.) sigh NEJM study? flawed last heard. know, that's part I'm asking. It'll 3 days minimal exposure. informed Sunday individual tested positive assume Friday risk factor, even minimal. That‚Äôs good news, least monster doom!!


(Ok I‚Äôm old enough remember unreal tournament) thing, one would tell anything wrong based appearance. least, would notice anything cannot blame bit tired/sleeping bad last night, symptoms ""minor"", probably one overdoing saying sick. really sick, feeling 100%, feel mood bit head bit full. nothing big, functioning normal person, feel normal. know difference thanks ü•∞ , studies refer CFR assuming covid ran rampant enough possibly caught everyone eg flu cold. hope felt superior hot sec tho you, negative result carry normally. Well normal masked stuff. doubt it. would much possibility people skipping second shots get personal benefits one.

I think we'll see things expand direction, reduced restrictions fully vaccinated beyond personal gatherings. I‚Äôm vaccinating 5 year old ASAP. I‚Äôve worked daycares elementary schools long enough know covid positive students sent school parents caregivers. ""In Minnesota, Osterholm said 740 schools reported cases variant. Michigan young people ended hospitals fighting serious symptoms previously seen children COVID-19.""

From article.  also focused data found lot said media popular reddit wrong exaggerated. reason go Walgreens anymore doctor gave prescription son fill doctor's order. medication.  lol. thanks contribution science Totally anecdotal, sore arm started 3 hours shot got worse day night. Hurt next day well bad. side effect shot 1. source lower efficacy Sinofarm. don‚Äôt remember numbers.

I thought issue Chile younger people getting sick?

This article say mass vaccination began high level contagion, consequence increasingly lax containment measures. worrying upward trend led World Health Organization (WHO) warn vaccination substitute infection prevention distribution vaccines, fail comply measures physical distancing, hand hygiene, ventilation avoidance crowded places, must continue along vaccination,"" said Maria Van Kerkhove, WHO‚Äôs COVID-19 technical lead. show statistics people getting sick (not testing positive) vaccination, means nothing. 40% first jab, 5% population tested positive pandemic. That's enough herd immunity yet. fine within month keep vaccinating pace.

South America gets lot doom stories written it, truth number positive tests considerably lower Europe U.S. farther go vaccination programme places. one though. E.g, used 2nd dose 6-9 months think great news. Last time saw comment it, rolling average 1.7M. Glad see things getting better. politicians using hotel quarantine too? HA. yes. Shit, really reason? thought blunting immune response. hold tearjerker headlines little longer?

No, individuals confined within single room longer 365 days reasonable precautions available (such masks eye protection) protect patients staff patients transported outdoors. feels like failure education. Wow!! CLUE this.. got first shot yesterday morning totally took 800mg ibuprofen HAND pain arm symptoms weren‚Äôt pronounced. Oops! two, also costs money. $14. can‚Äôt wait statewide mask mandates go away. office 100% vaccinated (and 3 months) mask cal osha requirements. 

‚ÄúBuT ProTeCtInG YoU!!‚Äù point aren‚Äôt, statewide mask mandate stand behind levying fines businesses. remember Texas spike cases last summer, IIRC mostly around border counties Mexico. lot American citizens residents coming Texas cases. lot folks Covid already, much big problem now. don't, though, literally don't. I'm sorry one generation repeat grade, either actual, real shut month get control this, spend rest lives dealing this. fucking bullshit. people Canadian citizens basically zero threat.

My parents group. got thier second (Pfizer) shot last month. reason allowed go home. hope feel better soon! risk/reward ratio benefit society. Like, hey get vaccine, feel shitty day, risk someone long term effects spreading someone might well you. 

The risks low. Truthfully, bunch young people get vaccinated get COVID, I'm losing sleep it. Might well fret people ride bikes without helmets. vaccines holding variants. public A-okay getting vaccinated. Jab many move on. also find ever strong bout pneumonia exercise routine survive. Regardless pathogen causing it.  Eventually, will.

B.1.1.7. slowing things down, intense public health measures they've put place addition progress rollout, surprised things started going better month. 

I remember faintly thing happening Israel brief moment, progress resumed. Okay thanks wondering would good take 2nd dose couple days Covid test required flight know don‚Äôt feel shots get holy crap anxiety roof second alcohol wipe comes out. 

Actually brand hand sanitizer work smells exactly like alcohol wipes use shots heart rate accelerated bit first smelled still takes time get accepted costs $14. People US need nothing come UK apart passport stay 6Months. Perhaps three groups people here:

* Extroverts
* Social Introverts
* Anti-Social People (whether caused social anxiety, general dickishness, etc)

I'm definitely Social Introverts category, missed activities found pandemic relatively bearable. pandemic itself, like disease, something find good in. response pandemic though lots terrible aspects, good things.

We found many jobs ""had done office"" could actually done remotely negative impact productivity. means work home avoid commuting, time family, etc. others means work companies without move physically located, companies means expanding talent pool anyone internet connection. pandemic positive terms doesn‚Äôt make sense me

The pandemic positive, forcing function. Forcing functions, whether deadlines, personal goals, pandemics, often unearth positive negative things. went college imagined learning cool stuff learned mathematics, get degree wanted, forced take bunch classes learned things I'm awful at, looking differential equations, things every considered studying deeply fascinating rewarding, looking abstract algebra. 

I think trying find good bad situations normal part human life. divorce terrible, led soul mate. never would learned much love punk rock flat tire. Third example. socially anxious isn‚Äôt thing introverted, think people social anxiety take steps cure anxiety.

I completely agree this, feeling drained social experiences needing recharge super different wanting avoid altogether anxiety suffering social anxiety seek treatment, isolation.

In event, thank reasonable discussion, know always seeing eye-to-eye, respectful discourse rare thank it. people admit kids spreading school?
Why adamant deny this? enough time test positive, right? think need shut economy flu, looking hard low-hanging fruit, like masking sick Plexiglas barriers winter. also desperately need paid sick leave expectation taking US. 1/3rd states already allow illegal immigrants get drivers license. already vaccination requirements schools somehow managed. Interesting. Yeah, Missouri like 90% Moderna seems. realize took 48 hours develop BioNTech vaccine, right? Maybe let's get world supplied what's needed hoard what-ifs maybes. Good start, bother going unmasked full capacity. preference, I'm fine waiting couple extra months get there. Pfizer sending data 12-15 hope approved end May latest. pfizer moderna also trails 6m-12 too. Think J&amp;J started too. 


Should well fall. Good probably alone rolling eyes every time hear ‚Äúbut variants..‚Äù 

The constant negative messaging turned much Needles freak too. look way I'm good. usually painless takes second. That's fact. aluminum adjuvants, Thimerosal preservatives, vaccines. antivaxxers lie what's even vaccines, believe ingredients secretly making people sick? credibility. proof. lies bad Facebook memes. It‚Äôll quick. You‚Äôll great. guys think they'll adjust CDC recommendations next month say people get together 2 weeks first shot?

From I've seen, looks like 1 dose Pfizer/Moderna gives coverage J&amp;J 2 week mark, considered ""fully vaccinated"" J&amp;J lasts 4 months. First world leader reinfected girl works Biocontainment lab says bosses already get revaccinated. uncorrelated. kill 1 month depression, probably takes years. Yes, administered page, chart, first anterolateral thigh used. 1.5-inch needle may used administering vaccine site. stop contracting spreading it?

That's thing, proof Pfizer Moderna prevent spread great deal, excuse can't used anymore.  I'm 50 hours 2nd pfizer. 1st day feel anything late night gone bed. low grade fever, headache, light nausea. Really fatigued. Today ghost headache also slight nausea energy returning. done feels good done Non-news IMO. Sure get 21 day mark will. Final Boss time far, hospitalisations cases going steeply vaccinated population one dose. course, big gamble taking. Sadly, supply issues, really choice take hope best.

In context lots supplies, like US, agree two dose regimen preferable. need take risk. Yet another rash response logical measure encourages people get vaccinated stop spread. go get vaccinated end sooner ""I'm right-wing dumb, swear it, swear it""

...uses word ""projection"" unironically. One alt-rights favorite terms, besides ""Virtue signal.""

Speech = 1 hiccups along way, rollout bad: Currently [90% delivered used. Rather problem lies procurement supply. exactly surprising, provinces counting confirmed positive cases COVID-related death; exception Quebec. starting make sense province many reported deaths, honest counting situation somehow exponentially worse. side effects started couple hours 2nd shot Pfizer. Headache, feeling sleepy/low energy sore arm. headache went away first though. I've read chance spread fully vaccinated essentially zero, necessarily apply new variants. also could wrong caught from. Personally, would still want people gathering wear masks gathering herd immunity reached. agree there‚Äôs reason fret ‚Äúgoalpost shift‚Äù ‚Äúrhetoric shift.‚Äù know goalposts haven‚Äôt moved. Wolfpack! one suggesting covid passports either, everyone thought idea ludicrous never thought there‚Äôd serious chance actually implemented. Though, it‚Äôs (an implant) seriously discussed yet doesn‚Äôt mean won‚Äôt ,nor mean will. That‚Äôs point. pointing meant comment.   honestly valid concerns. I'm huge fan weather, arctic tundra like people overhype be. weather pretty much exact rest northeast (maybe 5 degrees colder).

As location, Ithaca actually really nice college town. enough bars, restaurants, culture stuff. Plus, Cornell pretty big school (15k undergrads), imo nice social life centered around campus city. However, really like big city ideal college experience going dinner every night, nightclubs instead frat parties, shopping sprees, yeah probably Ithaca. 

Another thing note ask people go schools outside big cities, them, go city way less thought would. 

Hope helpful :) Neither. Neither good viable options current US healthcare system. experience area, random ideas came with? dont mean snarky way. get vaccine realized cant ho backpacking without vaccine passport. they've counted 10,530 suicides drug overdoses ""COVID"" deaths... ah OK, realize one best vaccine rollouts harshest restrictions

And feel UK's outcomes? see Worldometers nation's death rate somewhat higher U.S.'s, 1.86 deaths per 1000 residents vs 1.7 deaths per 1000 residents U.S. 

but case rate quite bit better U.S.'s, 64 cases per 1000 residents, vs 94 cases per 1000 U.S. leads think guys took bigger brunt bad fatal cases upfront, similar Italy NYC U.S. Hey bot, broken. contraindication getting vaccine previous anaphylaxis COVID vaccine components. 


That small number people. 3 weeks minimum. bet people complaining wait longer want go things (who doesn‚Äôt!). doesn‚Äôt make less effective.

However, anyone know effect second dose *prior* recommended interval?

My 2nd Moderna shot scheduled 24 days first, opposed 28 day minimum Moderna. 

Does matter all? isn‚Äôt running grizzly bear though.  Good. message needs ""The vaccination effort means returning true normalcy."" Anything contrary discourages vaccinations. Seeing restrictions mask mandates lifted places high vaccination rates good news mind. Again, like know details, restaurant workers tend younger later line vaccines. Doom gloomers tested patience limit. Okay, gave suggestion based experience. public health official specific answer seek. invalidate said based **my** experience though. 

what **do** know, health insurance system US limits people accessing care is, already mess need limits. really. There's reason basically public health bodies recommended delaying vaccine PCR/antigen positive covid tests. vaccine pretty good giving immunity variants too. natural immunity (and places like Brazil hell time right now). maybe argument waiting getting vaccine ""easy"" area it, live alone, see lot people day job, people get ASAP. J&amp;J 100% effective preventing hospitalizations deaths, really matters. live LA want kill every time i'm inching towards freeway onramp literally ppl jogging sidewalk passing by! know ppl literally waste 3 hours+ day stupid cars going &amp; office. Well I'll presume calling vitriolic antisocial nutter, since would vitriolic antisocial thing someone commenting good faith.

This true, lot introverts do, decline invitations stay home. erase social expectations obligations, many events situations declining invitation frowned upon. often social obligations can't declined, can't well decline going office, mean can, boss decline paying me, require money food shelter medicine, know, luxuries.

I think wide swath introverts pleased see rules change way need feel ashamed judged preferences still care extroverted friends family feel bad suffered much pandemic.

I'm arguing sort permanent lockdown even looking extroverts struggling time.

In another reply /u/tythousand rightly pointed introverts enjoy social activities, agree that, proportion. find society placed ""normal"" amount socializing higher prefer, whether that's professional obligations, family obligations, friendly invites etc. decline these, cost associated, stigma attached never socializing liking socialize, weighs people. weight removed, forced gun point go loud party care BBQ interest at, declined go would hurt someone's feelings caring human want that.

""Set damn boundaries"" sounds like really reasonable thing long place want set place society agrees with. want place closer society comfortable with, pay social penalty. people fine that, creepy hermits one end spectrum set boundary way high Logan Pauls world happy shove camera face, throw arm around you, shout opinions loudly set boundaries far low, everything between.

The point original post society could expand range acceptable boundaries bit introverts seeing many found time positive aspects introverts also want extroverts world happy understand time difficult them.

And think everyone, introverts extroverts, feel happy dunking people want others miserable. Walgreens. appointments Pfizer vaccine ThriftyWhite pharmacy 4 weeks apart. 

As long decrease efficacy bug me, come - modern programming languages native date calculation support. \`if\` statement somewhere probably one source file. wanted reserve supply government didn‚Äôt prepare adequately. CYA move COVID-19 prevalent say don‚Äôt wear mask public.  elderly pre existing conditions eligible many weeks months. demand groups obviously gone since states opening appointments everyone now. made post three months ago people probably would side then.

And CDC defined elderly risk don‚Äôt use argument that‚Äôs you‚Äôre talking use false information large percentage states right vaccine open everyone ""Favors covid deaths"" matter scale. would different thing wiping 10% population.  tried maintain relationship mom calling every week made cry every single conversation stopped calling told ""maybe go therapy"" realized therapist worth salt would say ""Stop calling mom"". passive aggressively talking think idea much better mental health is. used invite stuff regularly occurred always made cry response would ""If like responses, stop talking stuff."" think may choose ask stuff much vax complete. Narc parents tough deal with.  I'm reading first statement contradicting virologist rolls eyes at. Remember [said variants continue spread mutate, potentially vaccinated people, potentially posing danger everyone refuse vaccine. Trump right still shortage vaccines people may actually prefer J&amp;J vaccine. better offer option risk people getting vaccine waiting longer get vaccine. think anyone arguing that, though could wrong..  Lesser evil? prevent complications death. Get first one available you. falsifying information okay? Seriously cares lied? bunch people country likely. January vaccines hard find that‚Äôs one thing literally doesn‚Äôt matter anymore. You‚Äôre using make seem like great person. question general boredom/curiosity:

What‚Äôs popular vaccine area? Seems like *everyone* know getting Moderna. Good stuff thanks. always get flu year missed year, get sick day two, I'm still ahead. Incentives like actually impact. get board with. Pretty sure shutdown 12, another handful replace I'm sorry. Lockdown + seasonal depression joke. survivor proud you. Sending love. Efficacy may there, 100% effective preventing hospitalizations death. whole point avoid collapsing health systems.

Tl;dr: use J&amp;J catch COVID die and/or end crowded ICU. Yeah no. advisable. ever vaccine get first dose also needs second. 

This frat party try different pain killer cocktails. it‚Äôs lost confused thinking im shaming im cheering people stay calm closing end

you shadow box like im keeping everyone motivated People get vaccinated potential incubators new variations disease. need enough people get vaccinated unvaccinated cannot even get it, get deadly mutations end able re-infect vaccinated that's get Pandemic Part II. say causing make accusation? Two doses recommended regiment. would extremely confused case. im talking elderly talking about? Manitobans know what's going Manitoba either. think people motivated enough without criticizing people. vaccinate fast Serbia, Morocco, Turkey, Uruguay, Chile... several poor countries fact started vaccinations well EU.

Like totally buy science / mask / it, messaging pure shit, could 5 bullet point public service add shows 5 times hour effective:

1. Wear mask, reduces spread severely
2. try stay spaced strangers
3. Vaccines work
4. 100% protection 3 weeks completing vaccines dosing 
5. dont freaking stupid ignorant terrible boorish humans. Antibody tests still super accurate higher rate false positives Jesus, absolutely heartbreaking. I've mentioning friends bmi requirement stupid low (30 bmi). like 70% population qualifies.

It stigma, looking Hey thanks that: found good stuff including reporting give hope possible vaccine passport app travel. Children, currently. Tried Ivermectin? weird, maybe different triggers. see feel way, would like respond here. First, ""media"" made countless news outlets, including television news shows, startup websites traditional ones, bloggers, old journalists go new media, fading newspapers, on. level quality varies reporters working various outlets. young learn, older make mistakes, sloppy always care, think hope latter minority.

Second, journalists scientists doctors (why would be? make much scientist doctor). So, they, legitimate media outlets, report told, much back forth refer exists.

Third, information pandemic, one epidemiologist told early on, constantly changing. finally, there's unfortunate trend media, journalists follow degree another, that's writing hits. worst part means simply rewriting another story that's ""trending"" news outlet it. quick dirty work getting original commentary rewarded, many places expected. see problem original story, could magnified voices, or, reporter hurry full plate, might insert error. Making matters worse editors copy editors fewer fewer days, deadlines minutes full days, one really luxury looking back.

Fortunately, web print -- errors could remedied letters editor day-late correction -- readers ability contact writer publication point error, perceived real, story could updated modified. Loll worry waiting, guys rough enough lmao. plan ofr boosters. Every year two boosters. fully eradicate covid. Glad things improving. hit freaking bad made many sacrifices.  use simile, geez Yes, risk death much higher.

The problem allowing schools continue even every thing else locked down.

There good approach schooling understand decisions made nearly places. agree sentiment except it‚Äôs still tough children maybe people can‚Äôt take vaccine reason.

Ah, I‚Äôm allowed call anyone political, yet gets say ‚Äúthey get facts Fox.‚Äù Got it. way ""prove"" level immunity. antibody test. sister lives Dallas..
She basically said talked her.
The stores enforcing mask. Still are.

Biggest downside gives crazy room ""argue"". but, it'll happen, wait see. hate msm. Probably middle ground simple antibody test. 30 minute test tell covid antibodies. Even employees don‚Äôt wear years discrimination created countercultures systemically reject solutions offered rich/white society?  state? pollen really kicking central NC, wife felt gunky day, also 3 weeks post-first dose, we're sure allergies.

If losing sleep it, go ahead get tested cautious get results, would bet fine.

The typical advice wait get tested 6-7 days suspected exposure reduce false negatives, assuming showing symptoms, think risk false negative pretty low. CDC blanket statement [anyone symptoms get without caveats time since exposure. makes intuitive sense, since there's enough virus cause symptoms, there's probably enough detected. many people wanted schools open even things weren't. obviously safe public. words interchangeable, doesn‚Äôt matter. Good missing point. 99% population hasn't.

Anyone truly followed CDC's guidelines social interaction, left house without mask, done anything ""non-essential"" year. Dont agree that, rare sideeffekt might triggered certain genetics. 
Almost side effects vaccines come shortly given - minutes theese cases days. Don‚Äôt think long term effects thing. yeah dude hang there. I've extra vigilant spite first dose I'll DAMNED fuck close finish line see study proper evidence bother idiotic predictions. Let's focus getting populations vaccinated! Maybe CDC changed messaging ‚ÄúGet vaccine get back normal‚Äù wouldn‚Äôt problem. ask, first dose Saturday. Yes, vaccinated vaccinated. enough vaccinated central vaccine passport ship sailed. encourage unvaccinated Canadians enter country. 

We already get 100,000 unvaccinated people day entering southern border. Ha nice. grandma wants book staycation us we're vaccinated Yes definitely. new cases hospitalisations nearly among unvaccinated opened quickly rollout progressed enough. likely government recommendation little impact changing people's behavior, one way another.

Example, 40% masked up, 30% still masked lift restriction. Small change (10%) population behavior going impact virus spread significantly across others (90%). tread lightly -- Magic Sky Man punishes deny power. vaccine notably silent topic  O:-) Goes show really want vaccine, drive 2 hours way get it


Most people (don't time take can't drive much weekends). AC megasites much availability, I'd expect state distribution shift somewhere else  effective vaccine is, lower overall population needs receive acquire herd immunity. Every percentage point eke gives us better shot true herd immunity wiggle room comes anti-vaccination people. &amp;#x200B;

This happens usually go outside inside time get back place nos running Good. Can‚Äôt wait travel open waiting able plan trip marry wife London. Employees customers get vaccine. disease big deal anyone vaccine. Great point, we‚Äôre definitely trending positive direction across board Holy shit... really hope satire lesson learnt Chile vaccines working, opening quickly rollout ahead counterproductive end going back lockdown cases hospitalisations rocket up. Megasites NJ turning away anyone. Local newspapers publish daily, number state people vaccinated far: want make two trips easily it: potential control exponential growth greatly diminished vaccination we've already done rapidly continuing mention case numbers spiking ton less harmful majority vulnerable vaccinated. theory really hard take seriously. far know common variant Chile B.117, cause severe illness, was/is also common variant Israel well. I‚Äôm inclined think Chilean population specific problem (in sense perhaps neglect towards regulations lead huge surge cases) vaccine issue way title article seems imply  Cannae fucking wait Doom. real, real bad Rio Grande Valley. population centers often overlooked.  Citizen NYC ever tell me. Finally. lockdowns. masks! Hopefully everyone vaccinated. Makes sense. Since beginning aides come go wherever restrictions people‚Äôs family members restricted seeing YEAR. I‚Äôd livid I‚Äôm sorry hear. God first Moderna jab. Phew shit really happening.   That's really relevant though cases hospitalisations unvaccinated people. ""Itll eventually better"" lot easier recognize world crisis.

It's lot harder think way status quo Technically correct best kind correct, you, sir madam, best kind correct.  difference Chile translated much higher hospitalisations mainly young middle-aged people point 5% ICU capacity left. actually look process CDC website. raw data reported CDC depersonalized IZ data base. implies raw data CDC getting actually stored somewhere processed reporting IZ system. actually super common government systems. ...when there's 1 billion shots 7.3 billion people (who, total, need 14.6b shots. Plus go waste variety reasons), there's way equal access everyone. However access designed, ""medical priorities list"" ""first come, first serve"": enough everyone right now. need whine it... average share expressed little intention getting vaccinated dipped relatively modest 5 points,2

5 percentage point drop sound big, 23% before, that's 20% people said ""No/Not likely"" moved curve. That's pretty big number.

The middle group always expected disappear, concerns true anti-vax sentiments grown due misinformation, ""No/Not liekly"" group slowly surely declining, anti-vaxxers may gained much ground. Ha. One lying know talking about. month ago lot people central northern NJ going Atlantic City. took parents get vaccinated together drove little 1000 miles 4 appointments. vaccine rollout work US? Walgreens administers first dose, responsible administering second well? heard people states would drive 1-2 hours first dose. assume time goes by, supply increase get second dose closer location. anyone uses apps notify close contact ever notified? anyone ever heard someone notified?

I wonder apps helped Pretty certain see social end long kids vaccinated, imo. Germans stupid they're soulless automatons. think like robots human beings. updated understanding world must first plug new data code process. ""Skepticism"" keeping neutral viewpoint evidence following evidence it. longer ""skepticism."" straight denial. Pfizer also way chill side effects. young people know got Pfizer fine.  


Moderna tended give fever/headache second shot rarer moderate side effects. suprising 3x dose Pfizer. get Moderna hangover headache next day dose #2 it.  Kids rarely die it. Gonna channel mj say, ""fuck kids"" one. worth shut save small number kids lung problems tiny number kids death. even possible know early? barely year. Rationale AZ 55 years old (NACI Cases identified far primarily women age 55 years
  * Mostly occurred 4 16 days getting vaccine

Info Health Canada. true actually someone lives Texas. lot bars restaurants mask optional, even cities. (I‚Äôm Dallas also visited Fort Worth since mandate lifted). all, obviously. I‚Äôve weird seeing ‚ÄúMask encouraged‚Äù signs.

Would also add bartenders employees places also longer wear masks. inaccurate help anti-vaxers. Neither virus ""hijacks mRNA rewrites DNA"". two dose series delivered mRNA cellular machinery (ribosomes) injected cells ""reads"" mRNA translates protein immune system recognizes foreign mounts response. intend back normal vaccination available school aged children. infected receiving first dose less severe illness asymptomatic infection. first dose provide 80% immunity. first time history Slovenia, pedopsychiatric ward full. Adult psych ward admitting suicidal, anorexic, devastated kids. look back all, hope worth it, really really fucking do. cases vaccinated people adverse COVID outcomes (hospitalizations/ deaths)? people able get Pfizer Sinovac used higher numbers? young people able get vaccinated? people tiny minority can't restrict everyone's rights b/c them.

And staying semi-locked longer actually help them. Unless virus defeated heard immunity, always stick around unless totally defeat via social distancing lock borders forever. That's realistic. 

If get vaccine, I'd rather rip bandaid let natural immunity make difference. can't get vaccine quarantine months refuse give COVID enough gain natural immunity. I've careful person know pandemic (pre-vaccine is) even believe cruise ships full vaccinated people party starting summer. 

And honestly, know quite people far refuse get vaccine likely get find they'll need cruise. Bonus! though contacts mostly limited work heard outbreaks.  state pretty plainly I'm making criminally simplified metaphor.

Basically, virus see huge difference CA TX, that's plain see right numbers. act like took totally different response, probably we'd like China make big dent. also clear numbers. also still deal flu every year. brother got first dose today. /r/losangeles seemed go weekend.

My brother said big sign lit said 'walk-ins welcome 16+' Depemd take risk dying car one trip

Versus risk one vaccine evens out

Rmeebr ain't getting vaccine everyday driving work Google mobility data curves look much different florida michigan. really curious outbreaks. None reported far. sinovac ""good"" pfizer one, good prevent hospitalizations deaths enough. week people 50 52 get vaccinated. gap usually bigger think running low supply new shipment 2M+ sinovac doses arrives. Nothing young people far, going decreasing order. April probably end hopefully everyone 40 vaccinated.  Pandemic much country though. Live rest life inside want though. genius. Somebody call Fox news Austin liberal whole. I'm Dallas. Lots people still wearing masks (especially liberal neighborhoods) lot people thought flu/fake/made look Trump look bad did. big cities better rural areas, think anybody good Austin culture actually caring this. Looks like Covax going get many vaccines India foreseeable future. 70s meaning aged 18-70?  Sorry say people exist. literally someone running town‚Äôs school board platform opening schools matter kids don‚Äôt act spread vector. Yup. flu perfect metric help people visualize risk COVID post vaccine, mention flu people get irrationally angry. start talking edge cases conversation becomes impossible. gulf states running ""anything goes"" vaccine programs contracted buy american, european, chinese, russian vaccines. Right UAE choose one want get vaccinated. I‚Äôm still wearing mask. look like ""impending doom"" warned of.

You need better job picking credible sources news ever saw anyone talking ‚Äúimpending doom‚Äù Thats point natural immunity brazil? seems none. horrifying ridiculous.

I got mine today - took literally less 25 minutes includes 15 minute wait time 

GET VACCINATED PLEASE part? source findings? actually sure that‚Äôs works. example, choose oxygen important you? Water? think virus trends areas, slightly impacted lockdowns mask wearing really much. virus naturally spreads. look graphs infections previous breakouts look remarkably similar Covid, get curve 2-4 increasingly tall peaks, finally drops sharply end. example see exact pattern.

I expert (but would love be) virus comes increasing waves probably exponential nature spread. point, enough people exposed virus can't spread easily.

It take complete ""herd immunity"". virus probably spreads certain parts community lot human traffic like grocery stores stores restaurants. need herd immunity everywhere area slow spread, need choke points. entire state say 40-50% immunity choke points probably 60-70% enough slow spread.

Add vaccinations warm weather think basically virus largely run course lot areas. Actually looking study, Gen Z leads way respondents saying they'll never get shot (26%), followed Gen X (23%), Millennials (22%). course like articles they're interested painting Millennials bad light. pulling numbers? Stg made rule yesterday smh ID referred still name DOB, seemed big issue 2 posts Yeah, name DoB used determining identification individual company. get hacked least.

Still explained ""all sorts PHI"" CDC vax card. minor PHI vaccine date, sure, nothing like ""all sorts PHI"". UK reveal age groups people affected blood clots. 

I guess answers it. Trauma duration lead long term mental health issues. people stress year now. That's short term all. worth, doom gloom coming Thr White House(which did), probably hot air. Depression suicidal. make system, stay me, makes sure vaccine enter establishment. Maybe resemble passport, work vaccine requirements already place many, many aspects life. news sun hotter night time.    Extended monitoring time 30 minutes I've heard. Pfizer occasionally recommended moderna significant differences   Maryland April 6 now. reasoning give antibodies get covid- afterwards. virus doesn‚Äôt chance mutate antibodies already there. Well per article already accept arriving via land border reason quarantine, guess much difference. New York New Jersey got hit hard even *were* public health restrictions. They‚Äôd much natural immunity anywhere country, more. here, especially hear talk UK even every single person wants vaccine vaccinated, still insist keeping special measures we've long.

I'm staying safe literally whole country vaccinated, what's point still letting everyone return normal? Understood, sorry came hot, lol. mean comment sound short. question 100% valid def excellent question! 

I work tech field sometimes emails/posts/etc come across short I'm trying concise:/

The point 1. Herd immunity 2. disease gonna endemic anyway this, like person said, much better someone catch cold asymptomatic take resources hospital... Kinda like someone carrier TB actually show symptoms vaccinated relatively short commute (30-40 minutes ) enough cause issues.

I actually know extent, damn, makes sense -- souce? I'd love read it.

In years living America (I grew country really quite good public transit networks), look back -- worst times life mentally strongly correlated times drive most.

Honestly I've never gotten used driving even many many years living here, aspect pandemic alone (not driving/just working home) served amazing mental health counterbalance negatives past year. Texas headed impending doom. wait two weeks. Remember confidence interval 10% efficacy. enormous useless. 1600 cases daily Texas really good number honest. reference state, MA, recording 2200 day. Typically, pharmacy automatically schedule second dose, nothing stopping person canceling appointment scheduling second dose another site. Who? Ready what? Yeah, actually accepted ‚Äúpaperwork‚Äù reason quarantine, guess would. White evangelicals form *very* distinct demographic group many ways United States. article merely recognizing division, strong racial component. Back assertion 99% hasnt data please. suggest one. I‚Äòm vaccinations (I‚Äòm vaccinated myself) - question lack proper testing COVID-Vaccine though. Think 5 years now. Isn‚Äôt cost extra security staff make sure people stay rooms? Healthcare companies force ppl sign waiver stating hospitals reserve right deny treatment refuse vaccine still get sick. Obviously ideal world isn‚Äôt necessary hospitals overflowing idiots refused vaccine, thats run trouble. That's literally recipe generating antibody resistant variants:

* 2021-03-11: [‚ÄòAn accelerated cauldron evolution‚Äô: Covid-19 patients cancer, HIV, may play role emergence 2021-03-15: [Virus Variants Likely Evolved Inside People Weak Immune absolute minimum. got second dose Pfizer 17 days first. CDC guidelines state early window 4 days saw worth mentioning states like NY got hit hard early probably way worse published numbers. got hit virus relatively new US struggled early response. Testing easily accesible, PPE short supply lockdowns resisted heavily. good portion populations probably good portion people develop immunity infection. 

So likeliness, case numbers NY much higher, vaccine immunizations high amount people developed natural antibodies slowing virus down. means Muslins rich countries vaccinated populations able go Mecca? Since back Wuhan, laymen real problem seeing danger expecting look like something would see disaster movie. 

The variants concern dominant strains US ([keep mind data couple weeks date one actually knows anything viruses telling everyone doomed variants. it‚Äôs certainly causing significant surge states thrown wrench plans reopen. mods keep deleting posts tracking process going üôÉ Lol thank comforting thought! üòπ Within first 2 days I'd agree introverts constantly bitching others desire go back normal.

There's segment people who's lifestyle shut way covid started. likely many friends, many connections, likely introverted, anti-social.

Those ones want continue. allergic first dose might silver lining allow different second dose. Assuming I'm allergic which...I would assume since I've never rash ever. like 1/4 percent? random. issue elderly specifically elderly significant health issues. 15,000 houses Navajo Nation without electricity. 75% houses US without electricity. big logistical hurdles running lines. Masks small step make large difference spread virus. Americans seem bizarre obsession evil must ripped first available opportunity people tend adult Europe. Masks one last things go, removing simply pointless threat 100% over. got second shot Pfizer 17 days first. CDC guidelines stipulate there‚Äôs 4 day window early side too. I‚Äôm ass almost 48 hours later confirm fact providing strong immune response. Well looking numbers doses administered amount people died, million one odds. chance get mashed car makes feel better. high time 2021

One Right choice. Assuming immunisation also required Hajj, powerful incentive get ~100% vaccination among Muslims, Hajj mandatory religious duty (albeit lifetime, capable going). No, AZ rough even not... also them. I'm puzzled seeming absence morbidity personal risk calculations, though sole danger COVID winding morgue. 

What I've read year suggests even mild cases potential rather alarming long-term damage organs lasting effects, across age groups. I'd think would give anyone pause. 

I mean, *isn't* flu--neither great-grandfather's Spanish pandemic, less-legendary one caught spring break five years back. completely novel pathogen still know much about. 

So tendency make sweeping, casual mitigating assumptions based analogy flu acquaintances' anecdotal experiences bemuses me, especially contrasted often hyper-cautious approach ""new untested vaccine"". open everyone, makes official. weeks already anyone BMI 25% get vaccinated. 

That means 70% adult population NJ Pick poison guess? like guy tells someone smoke 2 fisted full whiskey drinks, acquaintance get vaccine cuz possible long term side effects sitting inside day playing World Warcraft hours days end lol can't good long term either. least months notice come back avoid this. knew coming decided stayü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è paranoia. ""One recent study released Ad Council found half white evangelicals said likely get vaccinated, compared 64% evangelicals color. groups well rate non-evangelicals, 77%.""

It explains right article. Same. Twice since infection back March 2020. June two weeks ago. many immunity due natural infection? Vitamin D! (Regarding Brazil, harder make vitamin there's lot air pollution.) all. People risk Covid need vaccine impacted rare clotting live Virginia got notification via mobile phone alert system vaccinations city open 16+. even though states officially making time, individual cities counties can. Many states BMI qualifying condition.

Basically every state BMI qualifying condition.

I'd question many truly healthy people know gotten vaccinated, people uncommon qualify pre-existing conditions rules. thing Brazil souther hemisphere assume thier cold flu season would June July. Bit right. Peak cold flu season Brazil April another peak late August September. learned anything COVID tracks nicely cold flu seasons different regions. would guess people work places, regulars, probably exposed long ago. funny seen criticism yet UK wished government took kind action much sooner did. Hotel quarantine quite common thing now. Maine April 7th facilities since 4/3 dipshits can‚Äôt put 1 1 together? It‚Äôs entire point. drive car yourself

Which like 76% America IIRC excited news. tell supply finally starting outpace demand. Starting see sites appointments open significantly longer periods time. rates change rapidly, staffing number beds account that. 

But people flouted COVID restrictions mask mandates got sick caused ICUs overcrowded across world. knows many people died able get adequate treatment non-COVID issues. doesn‚Äôt line reality ground, ok.

Vaccines working variants well. Same. Wonder what's going 16+ data? 30s huge part population. Given Covid predominately kills older people, vaccine still good age groups. would literally kill people worldwide ‚Äòcancelling‚Äô vaccine, seriously stupid thing say   Also focused Chinese vaccine good ones. mean, deliveries supposed shoot april - pfitzer alone deliver doses april Q1 together. 6-8 days post exposure best testing window 2-3 days symptoms. perfect world I'd probably same, thousands people dying every day getting vaxxed stop that. Seems like reasonable risk/reward case. true recently, always historically. supreme court rules government could make smallpox vaccine mandatory. think messaging, compelling case made people hesitant vaccines. People dislike masks, social distancing, group limitations mitigations might convinced, vaccine allowed away things dislike. Instead get messaging government, even vaccinated still keep already today. current messaging nothing day day life changes vaccine. gives people vaccine hesitant reason use question point getting vaccinated. Reduced risk serious illness, hospitalization, death come across tangible benefit.
Tell people start resume normal activities vaccinated people start think whether vaccine fears greater personal discomfort. Watching packed stadium Texas meaningless baseball game strange see past year. condemning anyone going interesting see exposures there. Fauci said adolescents fall, younger kids probably closer 2022 Q1. it‚Äôs worth  Suicides 3,000, overdoses 20,000. headline? Suicides down! normal year overdoses 20,000 count major headline. bury doesn‚Äôt fit narrative. Day lost respect kept insisting masks nothing prevent spread. know people twisted try say concerned personal protection equipment. truly case could‚Äôve simply advocated people using homemade masks. reason many people rally around politics. ""Because CDC said spread school also 3 ft OK compared 6 ft spread schools sure""

/s

I get virtual schooling sucks much teachers, kids parents, still needs nuance admitting spread occurring schools risks need evaluated whether easing school restrictions worth so, degree worth it. running manufactured narratives school spread occurring like many done so. believe it‚Äôs still optional. Get tested unless don‚Äôt health insurance. Don‚Äôt want risk exposing others site.  user verified author article. Merck failed project developed vaccine France. vaccine ineffective, gave up. Merck factories France instead produce somebody else's vaccines. want see grandkids maybe? given plenty time notice prior mandatory quarantine going effect. whining zero very, low. vaccination allow body produce robust antibody response natural infection.  Yeah reading Benzene hand sanitizer issue fun germaphobe. Maryland opening mass vaccination sites tomorrow anywhere next week. Same! I've great mood day since got it. Congrats! Austin isn‚Äôt representative sample Texas. all. good news I‚Äôm posting, complaint side affects second dose. first dose moderna breeze.
My second shot took ride life long double single dose vaccines. I‚Äôve rabies triple dose shingles double dose side affects. got sick two days 2nd moderna shot knowing good thing best part. 61 didn‚Äôt think immune system would launch response. never sick 30 years (vaccine vaccine). got flu like symptoms less runny nose cough, sleep difficult. walked little fast, Heart rate would go maximum. found breathing bed strange suffocating. started day 2 lasted three days. first time life happy feel sick. Maybe leave days responsibilities second dose? It‚Äôs getting lot easier get recently. go cvs midnight it‚Äôs pretty easy get. That's good news, seems much surplus distribute inventory demand higher like LA OC. first Pfizer dose. don‚Äôt get shot another 4 months. concerned P1 variant circulating BC. think that‚Äôs variant able evade vaccine? hope restrictions stricter get ahold prevalent variant. US seems verge potential B.1.1.7 spike. possible ""first dose surge"" could nip bud, especially send areas currently driving surge. hot weather? even Texas? It‚Äôs way easier get healthy get rich agree, I‚Äôm sure ones willing. Fever lasted longer first time. second time lost smell; back February it‚Äôs still completely back. throat also bugging / sore since then

And like losing smell sucks. It‚Äôs really something take granted. What? Also, say ""more Spring 2020"", shit? new virus last Spring. Please notice privilege statement. understand fear, I've face repeatedly continuing go work healthcare worker maskless people breathing shouting train every day go in. unbridled fear encountering unmasked strangers even vaccinated seems excessive. many choice without level protection recently. drink way usually weekend you‚Äôre probably right. might get tested tomorrow safe. would question testing facility. exposed refused test 4-5 day mark exposure. son exposed Saturday insisted testing following Monday. Different doctors, different testing locations. I'm scientist, seems randomness kills. Maybe simply made way population killed people would susceptible first place. could population thing kills longer around. Yes, confounding effect lockdown UK - exactly pointed decline deaths outpacing decline cases. compelling vaccination effect. Thanks! appreciate kind words support, I'm great. amazing wife awesome group close friends love me. think virus gonna virus along ride, maybe making minor changes end, conquered disease. people take weekly suggestion numbers vaccines seriously. reason time window that's time frame done trial confirmed. first sure effective one dose studied trial, effective. definitely need wait two weeks final dose ""fully"" protected. think that's exactly point articles: remind people vaccinated enough people still need non-pharmaceutical interventions.

But still, think vaccines allow us eventually normal life. Sure, silver bullet, still pretty strong bullet (when widespread).

On second point medical reason get vaccine. doctors council patients get vaccine help overcome anxiety around it. auto immune group constitute population can't get vaccine. funny...

I'm dark humor, pretty lame non-creative comment. right, speed quality vaccines created incredible. 

But couldnt sit hands months manufactured distributed forever.  today's presser, Sim√≥n said hoped age restriction could lifted soon. way phrased it, guess it'll probably EMA's final recommendation week.

However, say we're giving young people anymore. Mostly everywhere Spain group targeted AZ aged 60 65.

I read around 48% want asap, maybe things slow bit end April. balance probabilities UK regulator looking 30s - barely started vaccinate age group apart clinical vulnerabilities. likely point May. Also, might younger people (particularly women based European data) suffer brain blood clots AZ.

This might explain difference calculations far Germany Norway vaccinated younger cohorts AZ, UK mainly vaccinated older groups AZ.

Not many young people AZ - much issue revaccinate different vaccines. Additionally, Moderna Novavax coming soon May. last week already getting much easier get vaccine NJ. opened megasites well popup sites need appointment. 

Some Walmart stores person signup open getting shot done two weeks ago CVS pharmacist telling older people bring get vaccinated spot even appointment. 

All NJ administering 100,000 doses per day Governor said number grow upcoming weeks. seems like silly place draw line considering huge amount freedoms already give order get flight... concern less lethality, fact children - nature children - parents guardians often siblings family home. vector, really increase spread, nature many people interact day often less ideal hygiene.

Basically, problem kids going get sick, schools act breeding ground. Variants aside, population entirely immunized covid outside children, kids really spread virus, inevitable we'll see huge upticks numbers want keep clinical trial results debatable, data is. fact matter J&amp;J huge leg single dose, Novavax gives better coverage overall both.  headline efficacy claimed vaccine symptomatic covid. Sympotmatic covid, Hospitalised covid covid death separate efficacy numbers. vaccine studies also make efficacy claims asymptomatic covid.

As turns Moderna, Pfizer, AZ, J&amp;J, Novavax Sputnik study data calculated efficacies death 100%. approved autumn. Trials children much quicker previous trials, they're really checking adverse effects vaccine children, take long. Good man! Got first dose Moderna today too. I'm kinda scared side effects might get later, know it'll worth end. NY, CA, MA, CT spanked pretty hard early on. people ""densely"" populated areas know least 1 person either died became seriously ill long term side effects.

This EU pissed, saying agree actions threats blocking exports. EU good cause longer trusting AZ deliver. early Pfizer shortfalls clearly announced explained, AZ unfortunately kept cutting amounts would deliver throughout Q1. 
 
So yes, UK, AZ delivered. EU, AZ absolute disaster. US hate testing shows incompetence charge opening.

Atleast vaccinate people properly.

People like idea vaccine passports contact tracing surveillance gathering restrictions. Somehow, lockdowns business closures months end extremely preferable that. many Westerners want treat COVID mitigation like zero-sum game see well that's worked out. least without measures place 

Why making counter argument argument presented? Places like South Korea Singapore--countries took different paths towards COVID mitigation--are definitely completely open, implemented policies allow societies function somewhat without constantly COVID surges overwhelmed hospitals. South Korea currently dealing mini waves among unvaccinated that's 400-something cases whole country! cases spread worst thing happen SK vaccination rollout continues, hopefully cases continue decline.

What I'm saying alternatives US Europe dealing with, demonstrated countries, we've always got excuse want policies. So, we're stuck situation we're in.

We cynical. I‚Äôm *really* cynical. Yes, prevented schools 'huge role' spreading virus. Travis County (which includes Austin)issued public health ordinance asking businesses continue require masking. went route (rather Mayor issuing another order) public health ordinances supposed allowed outside state order. course, Paxon sued, far, judge ruled him. course, still people businesses whatever want, part, Austinites still masking businesses still requiring them....except apartment complex, since mgmt never said darn thing since Abbot's order. No, reply dumm. I‚Äôve worn masks social distance haven‚Äôt infecting people. vaccine won‚Äôt get lmfao. getting vaccine right actually unselfish thing. Still plenty people want haven‚Äôt gotten police state thing kind overblown. single example government trying take advantage covid restrictions attempt kind totalitarian power consolidation, like keeping emergency measures forever despite threat (which people repeatedly brought fears here). Look Australia New Zealand, tightest lockdowns Western countries - authoritarian bullshit happened lockdown-hating US last year two. 2nd dose effective don‚Äôt give 2nd dose 1st? ü§î Thrombocytopenia cvst exactly timeline predict happening well. Yep, 100 degree fever, fatigue, aches. gone within 24 hours onset. lol, actually went threw post history. 

Not incredibly creepy, also lost argument. want secure loss, though, made single grammatical error, would correct me, would clearly cement win. 

I wish opposite grandparents. hope live long cognitively healthy life continue disappointment eyes. Thanks! innocent Norwegian person like bound ask stupid questions. article Sinovac different vaccine Sinopharm. Sinovac one low efficacy rate. caught everyone eg flu cold

You still don‚Äôt know difference IFR CFR felt superior hot sec tho

I definitely did, since you‚Äôre pretty stupid. One things ask social media accounts history last 5 years

Pretty sure give anything sort! must new so. Lethality isn‚Äôt really goalpost, tho. It‚Äôs inevitable mutations come widespread transmission. ""Please understand, B.1.1.7 variant brand new ball game,"" Osterholm said NBC's Meet Press. ""It infects kids readily. Unlike previous strains virus, see children 8th grade get infected often frequently ill, transmit rest Older populations prioritized nationwide Covid-19 vaccinations. 54% Americans 65 older fully vaccinated, according CDC, 75% age group gotten least one Covid-19 vaccine age group relatively well protected, Wen said, younger groups still vulnerable B.1.1.7 variant circulates. variant contagious may cause severe disease, experts said. Research suggests may also ""We're seeing places like Michigan people getting hospitalized large numbers people 30s 40s,"" Wen said. ""And we're even seeing children getting infected larger numbers too."" read actual report can't find actual methodology. parents - 71 &amp; 65 - get 2nd dose covishield/astrazenaca next week india. assume chances hospitalization &amp; death 0 2 weeks second dose? You‚Äôre right. one winter. Wouldn‚Äôt want another winter compare determine wave affected seasonality?

Each every wave worse one due transmission setting new higher baseline wave. start higher baseline course larger wave. 

Wave #4 already eclipsing wave #3 countries around world. thought wave #3 worse #1 #2 proof seasonality seems pretty flawed. Fort Worth here. Anywhere doesn‚Äôt strictly require masks essentially maskless. Grocery stores seem places see enforced. Restaurants, bars, stores, hotels etc done it. Went concert billy bobs couple weeks ago don‚Äôt think saw single mask wasn‚Äôt worn employee. people stop bitching buck pay $2000 quarantine especially since government advised people travel unless it‚Äôs essential

Is government failed abysmally get age demographic vaccinated? high likelihood vaccines reduce viral load that‚Äôs proven yet

I'm fairly certain saw half-dozen posts CDC claiming otherwise. Judging multitude frantic, angry comments thread, u/lordhamster1977 desperately concerned rights rich Canadian snowbirds avoid *ardous* 3 day quarantine. Hero‚Äôs work. trials, one received vaccine died COVID hospitalized. Obviously, large population, rare exceptions, fully vaccinated individual, flu much dangerous COVID. Sinopharm Sinovac two different vaccines. 50% quoted appears Sinovac. 

Sinopharm appears around 79%. Herd immunity end goal, course, ultimately doesn‚Äôt really matter bunch people get mild cold don‚Äôt need hospitalized it. Comparing previous wave also apples oranges since testing LOT confusing mess people travelling beyond regions get things want. Got sources that? almost like everything came fucking trap lie.

hrm. *is* feasible US. incompetence laziness Walgreens. agree can't let uninformed people drive public policy. can't force people take vaccine, best educate move on.

We needed tell people honest truthful information since start would make informed decision now. Since that, good luck trying convince even listen point.

Young healthy people die, 1-3 percent athletes develop myocarditis. tell someone they've got 1 100 chance illness lasting longer months, people would change mind. Even aside people get sense smell back. really worth risking sense smell? Personally think so. Sure did. Yeah, thought first shot gave immunity second shot made last longer. issue people privileged enough get vaccine others 

I'm glad able admit core issue. Unlike posters, least intellectually honest. 

&amp;#x200B;

The rules apply reason, keep potentially infected people spreading disease. folks went way ensure infectious, getting vaccinated... exception rule. Following stupid rules make sense something aspire to. 

Perhaps trust US vaccination records, could require additional documentation? Perhaps paperwork pharmacy, antibody test etc. Issuing vaccinated individuals definition stupid. That‚Äôs always goalpost responsible parent anyone cares kids. shouldn‚Äôt anymore lockdowns would pretty selfish easy things like wearing masks either cases become negligible kids get vaccinated months now. Awesome news, 77% vaccinated enough. know whether vaccinated carriers, bringing virus back facility infect others earlier vaccination process.  staff leave go wherever want come back potentially infect seniors. Makes absolutely sense. ones confined ones coming going!!  Asymptomatic spread real. experts agree this

Yet citation. easy ""all"" experts agree.  Fuck this. pose danger. want punitive, ask government, private citizens. 4thewimsey11 minutes ago idiotic. Data data. Im aware US government based vaccine passports....I think alone kills idea. rule come since left? still pushed thread.

These people sad. Hmmm. nice way would say, ‚Äúmany people finding eligible read full list qualifying medical conditions, many seems people fall one category another. check out!‚Äù

PS - coworker saw BMI rule called out, ‚ÄúYAY FAT! finally came handy something!‚Äù people good sense humor it! might care, governments care much, going consent changes scientists tell could end disaster, even chance disaster small even zero reality.

Sure, day 41 someone basically immune day 42. governments, day 41 worth nothing day 42 everything. rules stupid. pose risk, punitivism public policy I‚Äôm happy everyone gets vaccinated. issue people privileged enough get vaccine others accept still middle pandemic rules still apply. 

Also, US system keep track vaccinations handwritten forms, everyone claim vaccinated.  couple months old mean outdated lol CDC outdated Mine started 4-5 hours post-shot completely gone 22 hours in. really like switch flipped‚Äîthe aches longest lasting side effect, suddenly stopped around noon day shot. last year none died wearing mask 35+ It‚Äôs even ‚Äúcare facilities‚Äù point. It‚Äôs ‚Äútorture facilities‚Äù. like winning Powerball. Sure could win odds won't.

Just like people never lose large amount weight keep life. OTOH great news diet book authors claim magic bullet year year gym/fitness industry always pushing exercise answer.

It's circle life diet industry lol. vaccinated doesn‚Äôt mean can‚Äôt get infected spread it. high likelihood vaccines reduce viral load that‚Äôs proven yet. people stop bitching buck pay $2000 quarantine especially since government advised people travel unless it‚Äôs essential It‚Äôs evil is, plain simple. Absolute evil. agree. super disheartening depressing. knew people crap, pandemic really shown selfish careless people are. know government mandate would never stick, others said. keep wishing possible :( Smaller countries done success, possible US. people talking about? seen this.

Are okay? 32 female good-to-excellent health. got shot around 2pm Friday developed aching pain \~12 hours dose (I woke middle night body aches). woke up, tired, mild fever (99.6, normally mid-97s), felt achy. ""feeling bad"" scale, 1 perfect 10 absolutely horrible, 5.5 like 4pm Saturday. time feeling bad, still able take dog walk, like debilitated stretch. 

tl;dr felt moderately crappy starting 12 hours dose, lasted 14 hours (many asleep anyway) Ahh, yes. That‚Äôs right. Makes sense. guess kills idea vaccine passport US then? Canada never trust US travelers given vaccine cards paper based? got J&amp;J also surprised quickly side effects started. fever within 5 hours. NCAA next superspreader event oh wait.. spikes Also kids can‚Äôt get vaccinated all. less risk isn‚Äôt zero. don‚Äôt know long term effects yet. top that, circulates likely new variants emerge evade vaccines. sounds like \_feel\_ higher even though reality differs. There's also hope people struggling could bit reset them. Selfish tell others safe encourages them. ridiculous article whole point experts, listen expert opinion Thank again. nice fact based conversation this. 

From article sent, guess key ""viral load"" vaccinated person would develop get Covid much lower may prevent transmission others. good tidbit. 

Cheers know UK, Pfizer AZ delivered. one else yet UK bought LOT vaccines. know Moderna delivered abroad. AZ delivered here.

I've tried really hard get data numbers delivered promised can't find anything anywhere. J&amp;J filed one dose ran trial one dose. That's it. could well Pfizer Moderna one doses better J&amp;J one dose. tested clinical trial. FDA rules adaptable pandemic. health agencies different countries spacing vaccines adapt reality ground. FDA good that! Canadian government way completely verify claims vaccination. print fake card home looks like one CVS gave me.

It doesn‚Äôt matter they‚Äôre vaccinated there‚Äôs way sure they‚Äôre vaccinated. Skinfold tests horrible. Get DEXA scan get back us. Social distancing forever lol. Anyone thinks insane. source outdated \- data tell different story brief instance isolation turns year solitary confinement, job losses permanent business closures.

How fucking sad cheerlead death tallies meet worldview? This. 


I would bike commute shower work. i'm sure TBH. many different dates. NOwe restrictions lifted Feb 16th, thought Brampton, Peel, North Bay March 8th, City proper may extended provincial restrictions.  21 days Pfizer. 28 days moderna Ignore tell piss off. people know science works, best interests pretend they're saying anything  'world' pretty crappy job look quantity discount low end vaccines Israel willing pay MSRP get want/need premium vaccines. confirm vaccine site though. prepared it‚Äôs nice give heads wanting given thigh. No. don't. thing see working incentives, goes far

People want motivation works point everyone. Pushing vaccine people opposite effect causes people choose get vaccinated. 

Whether like not, choice. People going choose want body. may agree, may agree, suggestions **encouragements** limiting options people either get vaccine dont health insurance/have pay higher rates, etc. force coercing, simply **not** sustainable long term. situation. 

You want know badly mechanism would use sure why. say matter end day. seems want give reason dismiss said, going work. 

So maybe since answered question, answer mine. you, real life experience working within US healthcare system US health insurance industry, particularly management administration? background medicine (I'm engineer working biomechanics, understanding process study publication read LOT this) know enough speak antibody levels. I've heard, protection least months person covid, vaccines offer better likely longer protection. Austin City Limits books mid-October. aren‚Äôt selling tickets yet, Texas least 1/3 16+ first shots. sure March 20? It‚Äôs far normal winter weather Texas. Speaking Dallas area, highs 50s 60s January it‚Äôs completely unheard see day 70s dead winter. state gave one company vaccines donated tons money campaigns. CVS Walgreens came weeks Publix given vaccine - likely pressure right. literally fired person charge gathering reporting numbers, came said fudging figures, raided home lmao. diagnosed panic disorder agoraphobia 15 (31 now) symptoms definitely gotten worse last year. 

My mental illness prevents driving, can't ""get nature."" made city life. before-time, used many things unofficial exposure therapy. Bars, coffee shops, libraries, pride events, church, sports games. even got airplane once. getting better. 2020/first half 2021, cancelled. least I'm still working forcing shopping person, else might really risk becoming housebound again. Ah yes, fictional two weeks could‚Äôve saved world! saw woman(hospital worker, keep mind) around 30 post Bumble ""she 'truther' match anyone vaccinated"" along political stuff can't post I'll marked ""political."" Maybe some, would argue lot people bubbles peers believe vaccination. it‚Äôs gonna mutate get rest us point keep alive adorable reading much question legitimacy financial hardship claim. Really, is. It'll superspreader event, like Super Bowl was!

......................oh wait important Fauci strong advocates vaccination strongly differ think proceed going forward. Fauci saying think we're going significant 4th wave continue current vaccination approach Osterholm extremely worried thinks need get everyone level protection soon possible. Regardless think Dr. Osterholm, much suspect Fauci's statement response Osterholm saying weekend. That's argument official ""vaccination passport"". Harder falsify, hooked CDC records. Canada country refuse vaccination card. continue problem. go back seeing friends regular basis, going concerts, eating out, etc. 

Won't awesome?! :) don‚Äôt think so. stressing two weeks second shot Pfizer moderna people skip getting second dose. really looking data honestly I‚Äôm seeing virus spreads waves. Behavior somewhat factor regulations seems big impact (short hard lockdowns countries). California‚Äôs wave like Arizona‚Äôs even though restrictions different. virus spikes hits peak recedes. It‚Äôs quite confusing. Vaccination mandatory. Well suppose that's much factor Ireland I'm really thinking it. unwillingness come lot different places. poor black people trust medical science right now, answer shut society. exacerbates issue.

I guess that's fair point. bill Medicare expert US social safety nets how, exactly? apparently drive car yourself, least average person. people commute train instance psychological issues, even commutes long interacting people directly.

it seems likely combination stress (road rage etc) fatigue driving paired isolation car long periods time. could make arguments bike commuting too, know exercise beneficial psychologically, that's probably net benefit. France last week numbers really staggering. 2,000 excess deaths day height second wave (the one caused variant).

Since 60 million people South Africa reddit likes compare everything America, that's equivalent almost 12,000 deaths day US. South Africa much younger population.

Total excess deaths across year would equivalent 850,000 US. effective first shot? remember reading 50% I‚Äôm honestly sure. Well you‚Äôre low income low EFC kids dangerous!!! I've saying YEARS!!! least since 3rd grade! You... asking medical advise Reddit. It‚Äôs neither reassuring reassuring. Speak doctor Nah since even start buying groceries till like August last year, ever worry that. basic hand washing hand sanitizer. 

But wife told gone groceries took clothes door stuff. assumed people got tired it, realize new guidance came out. related covid? grouping two unrelated things. Would rather hear ‚Äújust years?‚Äù There's difference motivated adult 12 lol Philippines one long continuous lockdown since march 2020. France alone, definitely worse places in, doesn‚Äôt mean aspire handle pandemic best can. Yes yes. would go three day road trip get tbh Moderna 2nd dose felt achy fatigued 48 hours, also really odd heart palpitations. Apparently that's known side effect, heart pumping like ran marathon, (hopefully) going pass soon. Agree + kids need social aspect!!! I‚Äôm god damn tired hearing supposed 4th wave.

You millions people per DAY getting shot arm, plus people who‚Äôve already covid immune right now.

There‚Äôs 4th wave. Enough fear-mongering. Wisconsin Minnesota consistently top 5 doses used, near bottom doses distributed per capita. Meanwhile, Georgia 2M excess doses used sitting 67% usage.

Idaho, New Jersey, Utah, Indiana four states huge discrepancy using large amount vaccines, still receiving below-average distribution.

Luckily, Massachusetts near top doses distributed per capita - based usage. school library week allowed kids check books again. We‚Äôve person since October. 

But also think it‚Äôs librarian lazy doesn‚Äôt want reshelve books. Fair enough  common thread reddit users bashing right wing politicians.

That's pretty standard behaviour site. can't completely open take masks kids get vaccinated. Attributing excess deaths Covid country worst TB load world government effectively test TB Covid testing taken laboratory inventory MIGHTY presumptive. 80 000 people die TB South Africa system works fine. Shudder imagine number would people even tested (and definition, even treated). Actually, reading papers r/COVID19, learning smoking appear scientists negative effect course disease. even least one pre-print theorized small protective effect. So, seemed counter-intuitive, no, really worry it.

Smoking coping mechanism, since gave drinking 7 May last year. I've anxious stressed knew I'd setting failure tried quit fully vaccinated. 30 April, though, longer rationalize horrible habit. truly *want* succeed, know I've gotta health. Thanks good wishes! hear ‚Äújust weeks!‚Äù one time feel like I‚Äôm going explode. google many many many bad products courts. J&amp;J made products sold knowing pain suffering would cause. medications bad even faced results horrible products blatantly unconcerned. products literally caused death many. still back products.  lot people downvote posts discernible reason. Damn, real? wiping groceries year now? sure, COVID reading hypoxia, easily imagine waiting days see shortness breath got better own. They‚Äôre saying Grand Rapids Ottawa county, like they‚Äôre saying Detroit St Clair county. They‚Äôre saying Ottawa county ‚ÄúGrand Rapids metro area‚Äù predicted U.S. could see 400,000 500,000 daily new cases 12 14 weeks, roughly 100 days -- five times higher election day.

‚ÄúWhen B.1.1.7 takes off, it‚Äôs going hell,‚Äù Osterholm said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs they‚Äôre walking right now. hope I‚Äôm wrong. God, hope I‚Äôm wrong.‚Äù Covid animals already transmission vector zero control over. You‚Äôre arguing never get rid masks case. like said, im making justification advocating one. think good way show people want id laws restricting persons right vote wrong, like wrong mandate vaccines voting saw news article trials happening city. time saw article called them, voicemail box full. Monday morning wife got car drove clinic running trial banged door talked her. highly effective according peer-reviewed data. be. ill tell bars open way schools thus last year. $$$$ expect find something hey go: ""With new variants, particularly B.1.1.7 UK variant...we could blow past 300,000 next six fourteen weeks"". I'm confused, seem side arguing masks enforced front nationwide unprepared (even though trump knew least February 2020 serious played flu). CDC downplayed masks around time last year bc idiots buying masks toilet paper sight, wanted make sure hospitals could actually get them. Trump forced states bid lifesaving PPE money-for-him? feel like side. handling weird PANDEMIC GUIDELINE PAID TAX MONEY SINCE 2005 TRUMP GOT RID 2019. Different nurses different levels quickness too! see pediatric nurses vaccinate kids! 3 shots blink eye! I've fully vaccinated 3 months get 3 covid tests since various reasons. 

First direct exposure office asymptomatic individual, first dose then. Negative. guy coming first time, vaccinated yet like almost coworkers. negative. 

 Second personal travel fully vaccinated month, also negative. 

Third today upcoming work travel, also negative. vaccines WORK. Keep us posted goes!  18,000,000 vaccinations. 7 deaths.

Correlation causation. Massachusetts consistently top 10 % doses used. need increase eligibility, demand still extremely high. would cause issues people trying get amount appointments. right.. kept kindergartener home first able &amp; wanted ‚Äúright thing‚Äù.. made decision send back could tell would better long-term in-person attention issues. She‚Äôs done amazing since switching in-person! think would huge mistake keeping home longer. cuz CDC dumb said kids need masks mood might changed Covids danger hasn‚Äôt Parents hate it, too. 

Virtual learning awful, hybrid even worse that. schedule erratic confusing, socialization time block eliminated virtual kids (no time it), tutoring blocks eliminated (no time it). 

My daughter hates it, daughter‚Äôs teacher hates it, hate it. thing though covid less serious kids many diseases we‚Äôve readily accepted facts life. Flu, one, dangerous children covid is. Long covid doesn‚Äôt hold candle mono, burns every high school somewhat often. 

The argument schools open isn‚Äôt protect kids. It‚Äôs protect adults work kids come contact with. adults vaccinated it‚Äôs much flimsier argument. Remember - goal positive covid tests it‚Äôs people getting severely ill. ""if following speed limit, care others don't?""

Vaccines good perfect protection. I'm sure places going go trouble places may gain customers providing margin safety. shit kids lol experts saying studies specifically studied whether someone vaccinated still spread virus.

Well, exactly.

The CDC director came days ago said vaccines massively stop spread virus. CDC came said misspoke.

Here's thing. *director* came said that. means strong belief vaccines stopped spread, otherwise, get director say that? ended wrong, reflects poorly.

The CDC absolutely told someone Health Human Services retract claim reasons know. think they‚Äôll drop foolish ideas semester approaches? idea fully vaccinated campus still requiring masks distancing seems like Black Mirror episode Colleges businesses good reason require vaccine passport. congregate settings easy virus spread. Voting largely individual activity. vote socially distanced largely go polling station. I'm sure medical justification require vaccine passport voting. Took 29 hours me. nothing serious, bit feverish feeling bit weak blah. hear frustration, that. friends school lot less damage kids mental state hearing parents complain much burden thought school system would take care big part time could stuff rest time.

Maybe something think about. anyone common sense could predicted (and did). Osterholm spent entire pandemic pretending like worst case scenario *is also* likely scenario. sure anyone would listening point. Cause still catch virus, mutate, square one üò§ mask less douchebag grocery store acting like that. True, implementation things like REAL ID getting us closer soon. time join rest world imo ‚ÄúSo similar adults‚Äù lmao you‚Äôre talking kids haven‚Äôt hit puberty. Either troll/spam/bot account need understanding you‚Äôre talking about. I'm familiar history J&amp;J, cause pain suffering? aren‚Äôt healthcare provider, likely aren‚Äôt ‚Äúcovered entity‚Äú therefore cannot violate HIPAA. Thank you! That's scary sad. I'm able watch currently assume like others necessarily spread vaccinated? maybe worry US (I'm UK.) Meanwhile Texas fully opened 3 weeks case going ü§∑ quote says simple fact alcohol, interpretation laughably moronic. Dude Look data making judgement, Chile vaccinate 60+ age group, recent rise case reported younger less 50 age group. Hospitalization death 60+ vaccinated age group declining rapidly showing vaccine indeed work!.

The US recently reported 70k new infection, European countries also report 4th wave, mean Pfizer/Moderna AZ vaccine work?? dont think headquarters Janssen vaccines (formerly Crucell) Leiden, Netherlands. It‚Äôs independent Janssen pharmaceutical Belgium. Ok doesn‚Äôt change lockdowns effective LAST resort mitigation tools overused Europe Don‚Äôt fucking care people say different kind blood clot, really matter since even cause pulmonary embolism often unknown. **It happen obvious reason.**

It even pulmonary embolism. Maybe shush clue all.  Glad hear it! government mandate would immediately get struck right now.

They'll issues emergency use authorization. time full authorization (likely late summer) kind mitigation necessary they'll abandon it. Good luck, us. 

We‚Äôre entering third wave vaccinations going really well. Apparently got 10% population one dose last week I‚Äôm optimistic week. 

I hope parents get first dose soon they‚Äôve opened age bracket. live France? No, strict measures since May 2020. idea coming information. point, excuse, 100 million people US received least one shot. people home consuming mainstream news. Thanks doom gloom NYT. don‚Äôt though, even they‚Äôre catching 50% cases still means thousands chains transmission broken otherwise wouldn‚Äôt, pushing R without need social restrictions everyone.

If cluster infections even 50% individual cases misses, lateral flow still catch cluster early.

Lateral flow testing indeed informative individual level, population level seems completely sound.

The government need provide proper financial support isolation though. False positivities also problematic, quick PCR testing release people false positives would help keep people onboard. apperently realize alcohol Constitutional right.

Besides embarrassing spelling skills, absolutely did. lot people vaccinated choose live fear. claim amendment that. Thanks proving point twisting words again. time absolutely naive believe policy months.

Cash king summer kicks sheer number people make hard justify keeping place it'll se direct loss profit.

Furthermore...whats plan then, forever taking precautions covid? vaccine 100% effective? Yeah know that's happening, 90% effective plus high rates = herd immunity...not ""only 90% mean safe"" lol yea civility allowed sub. sure guys. sort controversial.  mods jokes.  go wherever city (in Paris French cities) within 10km radius. go stay however long want. clothing shops closed, teleworking mandated; idea guys call lockdown even French President cabinet aren't. haven‚Äôt Given situation slow things going (which actually bad think considering Canada third comes vaccines, it‚Äôs compare US looks slow), guess makes sense. it‚Äôs hard get one dose *elderly* guess one dose approach makes sense.

I hope least get first dose, believe one dose Pfizer couple weeks gives like 80% protection, people get level protection great. vaccines administered Canada? One final factor consider using IFR assumes get infected first place (in time frame offered AZ vaccine able get vaccine). absolutely relevant *no population world exceeded it*. sure love twisting people's words, including writers 21st amendment. Thanks. Temporary? started 3 weeks flatten curve.

Unfortunately another summer Covid-19 Europe. I'm thinking simply saving vacation days autumn instead. everything closed/restricted might well work summer. I'm spouse teacher close friends teachers they're first admit much easier teach home. Everything relaxed. 

Tell believe average person want continue easier lifestyle pay? biased. would get super low temp everytime went eat NYC winter. would wait body warmed up. theory could fever cold enough outdoor temperatures trigger fever temperatures  good thing means body supposed 13 days join fully vaccinated crew. I'm sure presenting ID vote unconstitutional. Imagine much easier voter fraud would even prove real person. author apparently hasn‚Äôt parkway rush hour recently. It‚Äôs simple.

Carrying around vaccine passport pockets annoying. Like forget home lose them. deal rest lives would good Terrance. got lot work Needle sizes differ. watch shot felt nothing. Sorry bud, don‚Äôt get it. So, saying people make informed medical decision vaccines still pending final approval on... jealousy? basically push people otherwise get ""rewards""? 

Doesn't sound like ethical medicine me. even possible 30% + 0.75% per day population gotten first shot? vaccines unevenly distributed? 75% (ish) people still got first shot. fair point Oh god, sounds exhausting! Thankfully, end date near future, niece going day camp program summer ran preschool/kindergarten, one first early learning centers open area. know take care managing everything. 

The first day I'm free, I'm going hour bath, play uninterrupted video game two hours hour long bath. think pandemic going produce lot research material research handle future pandemics.

People tout lockdowns solution, yet lockdowns barely seem anything. immediate counter argument ""They're *real* lockdowns!"" point Japan South Korea close European level total lockdown yet.

In fact: Japan basically fuck stop virus they're much better successful countries Europe.

Australia shows lockdown works long proper border control (something Europe lacks internally). likely impossible Europe kind lockdown required handle virus gets Europe. way stop spread getting inside region first place. EU borders porous internally stop it.

The thing think learn border controls much important lockdowns. doesn‚Äôt sound good.. eek. mRNA vaccines work well J&amp;J Novavax okay. really (promising) data others. mRNA booster shots available point, presumably fall wave could happen.

The good vaccines like wearing numerous layers masks. way we'd wear another layer top need unvaccinated people. Science denier take kids car, that's much deadly gamble. What's harm walking miles everywhere go. part I, regular dude getting vaccinated would direct anyone anything.

Secondly, HCQ hydroxychloroquine, I'd direct anyone take drug shown real therapeutic prophylactic value, especially, dude.

It‚Äôs happened know lol said available July earliest. Seems like another cash grab contractors like track trace. 

Opening places people everyone offered harsh, punish people got it, haven't. definitely discussion.

I live Vietnam getting vaccine least October. We've closed tourism since March country suffered, interesting see countries open tourism covid passports play out. I'm still confused rush though. Let's focus long term impact. also least concerned long term impact covid infection? example, anything comes this: seem like potential unknowns long term issues covid likely worse long term issues vaccination?  Ok, that‚Äôs great, you‚Äôre one person anecdote, science doesn‚Äôt agree. means affected something called ‚Äúplacebo Thanks, I‚Äôve edited now. bangs wear glasses often makes forehead run hot, especially I‚Äôm masked. I‚Äôm always worried failing temp check public failed work one occasion. That‚Äôs check orally safe. ‚Äòjust untils‚Äô we‚Äôre pandemic.It wasn‚Äôt people trying trick lie you. pandemic unknown. 

But needs happen everybody get vaccine we‚Äôre good. There‚Äôs problem decide get vaccinated. Yes full-time job! also fully remote first grader, hybrid third grader 4 year old. much keep everyone track need do. I'm so, tired. 

The 4 year old starting pre-k fall, I'm really hoping everyone go person. I'm going go home driving youngest pre-k lie bed stare ceiling two hours time go back get her. doesn't? used worked. is, lot asinine people social media. Again, Florida didn‚Äôt ‚Äúreopen‚Äù it‚Äôs ‚Äúreopened‚Äù pretty much better part year. cases increasing (slightly might add) independent restrictions 

Again, stop spreading inaccurate information isn‚Äôt much got first shot vaccine week half ago went park shot basketball first time year yesterday. wasn‚Äôt much nice. Also ball rolled old guy park bench thought might annoyed ball, worried cuz covid, looked went ‚Äúcan dunk?‚Äù. Super small stuff felt so...normal. helped. I‚Äôd say try little stuff that‚Äôs still relatively safe bit, long vaccinations Indiana keeps good pace expect explode like Michigan. high level vaccination 60+ also expect number deaths return high levels. charts show vaccines work, need higher vaccination younger ages cases drop. took laxative proceeded destroy toilet next 12 hours leaving quivering wreck became empty tube. 

You sir true wordsmith. Incorrect. half states upward trend. They're still around, waiting murder least expect  yeah, comment got thinking, ""... person going nowhere?""

thank verifying could get grandma grandpa pickin , we'd put end covid shit! whether vaccine passports good thing not? bad one person proposes good another one does? kept abreast rules. think data points bit different. think Michigan data ""fully vaccinated"" opposed ""partially vaccinated"". would probably add 15-20 percentage points Michigan data. 

I know sure, 45% 80+ would basically dead last nation partial vaccinations. would put bit behind middle road we're talking fully vaccinated. Texas would disagree, looked numbers. Still steady decline, I‚Äôm happy see that. FL pop went spring break it‚Äôs bad people thought going be. 

Shockingly great news! Lol He's saying they'll stop using point, ""passport"" like, say 3-month validity need get booster new passport. basically saying Americans think vaccine passports great Brits think suck seems bizarre well. Americans generally favor government regulation lives. states opened soon criteria. handful seeing surge. Nothing said inaccurate. Texas case numbers started back rising March 25. Florida‚Äôs started rising March 22. school longer remote learning probably would epically fail. brain doesn‚Äôt function nearly well versus I‚Äôm classroom setting. go certification class field it‚Äôs night day difference I‚Äôm person interacting teacher rather watching webcam. remember Twitter mandate lifted people losing minds reason. guess way everything going makes sense. Wow thanks fauci using scientific knowledge educate country fact shit sucks people hate Must missed last two. ... possible workplace provided PPE PPE worked? experience Massachusetts. Vaccine appointments gone within minutes here. Took almost week searching midnight 6am find appointment opening soon. combined bad behaviors appear driving forces. middle aged anything like middle aged people know who've gotten vaccinated, side effects bad. Wow, that‚Äôs funny. USA going pay reparations countries staged coups in, indigenous Americans, descendants interned Japanese Americans, descendants former slaves. Yeah, ok. Here‚Äôs thought, doesn‚Äôt USA focus shutting hell investigating insidious, deeply embedded sinophobia. hate Alabama gets number doses per capita places like Massachusetts hardly anyone Alabama interested getting vaccinated. Doses flyover America expire due lack demand people fight fiercely appointments Northeast due almost everyone understanding viruses are, work, vaccines help prevent viral spread.

I wish doses given states people actually want vaccine.

For example, State people 30% likely want vaccination receive 1.3x amount doses compared population. State B people 30% less likely want vaccination receive 0.7x amount doses compared population. Exact  That's works.  Antivaxxers deserve anything. Georgia masks packed bars since last May.. going Michigan cares? People get sick time. die need hospitalization, matter. not. Yea we‚Äôre fatigued constantly changes says virus... crisis shown Europeans defensive resistant facts Americans. 

So guess common.  international travel, domestic. F that. pays fucking great it‚Äôs cake job. Lots bedside RNs leaving this. make double average bedside pay simply administer vaccines versus abused patients administration. age. Unfortunately Indiana cases rise. 1 1 Dentists Reddit recommends it. Vaccination status private medical information. pretty good shape like 3 weeks first dose. would think safe hang vaccinated friends week. Fauci needs give someone else airtime. ""It's unsafe travel, recommend it"" they're trying say. 

Why they're struggling much communication beyond me. wish doses given states people actually want vaccine.

For example, State people 30% likely want vaccination receive 1.3x amount doses compared population. State B people 30% less likely want vaccination receive 0.7x amount doses compared population. facts make change mind, believe first place? Yeah, never catch Harvard operating anywhere Cambridge MA. It'd ludicrous operating places like Paris, Mumbai, Tokyo, Johannesburg, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Mumbai again, Istanbul. would people know merely completed Harvard coursework, highly exclusive Harvard Square? like schlub bucks gas visit campus person. States far greater restrictions experiencing far steeper increase since cases relative lesser restrictions. always hasn‚Äôt case moment 

Stop spreading inaccurate information Israel clear early ""get vaccinated else."" Great argument! Crap. thought non-paywall version. It‚Äôs good article. School reopenings causing rise cases. wasn‚Äôt checked enter bars tho encourage everyone UK adopt ron swanson permits NJ. NY. NC. up.

None states stand open average state. keep thinking scene Two Towers Theoden freed Sauraman's spell, Gandalf says ""breathe free air again, friend."" People stupid. export ban US. see EU circumstances allow export anything US longer.

You understand Pfizer/BNT vaccine requires three-stage process. first stage involves molecular cloning DNA plasmids code spike protein infusing Escherichia coli bacteria. **For markets, stage conducted United States,** small Pfizer pilot plant Chesterfield, Missouri[ (near St. Louis). four days growth, bacteria killed broken open, contents cells purified week half recover desired DNA product. DNA stored tiny bottles frozen shipment. Safely quickly transporting DNA stage important Pfizer used company jet helicopter assist. saw declining rates end reopening. numbers flatlined heading back up. TX FL, too. Nice. home state Massachusetts pace hit goal 4.1 million total vaccinations 2nd week may. idea anyone even measuring productivity office jobs anyway. experience, goes jobs pretty pointless. harassing me. You‚Äôve reported don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs real first place, would think you‚Äôre risk?

That‚Äôs bottom line. doesn‚Äôt exist it‚Äôs bad science says worry it?

These sentiments, idiots believe. I‚Äôve spent maybe 2 hours shops last year. hair cuts, eating out, seeing friends extended family, appointments, nothing. get car delivered, haven‚Äôt done literally opinions, immutable facts. vaccination passports aligns lot right wing beliefs. Mean well? Spreading FUD (fear-uncertainty-doubt) artificially raise relevance issues work thus position going since born (e.g. see Cold War). that's generous struck well. lack age group 70% vaccination. look Indiana age based rollout 60+ much higher level vaccination. first time think year, Indiana reported COVID deaths would attribute age based vaccine rollout.   even understand ""new normal"" stuff idea current situation last another year two even go back normal. makes sense. adult population US least first shot end May shots then. herd immunity middle June YEAR. ""the children"" concern, 1) severe disease, hospitalization, death almost nil people 18, 2) Pfizer already approved 16-17 year olds, 3) 3 vaccines likely approved kids 12+ time school starts back September 5+ end year. ""vAriAnTs"" concern, real world data shows least Pfizer Moderna effective variants. else there? goal not, never been, never zero cases 100% vaccination rate. right now, even health experts aren‚Äôt sure. it‚Äôs likely combination transmissible variant plus reckless behaviour individual basis Osterholm, again, predicts severe surge next six weeks. shows keep on? it. price endocrine system sticking around worth it, would given cancer etc. Excited upcoming year unlike other. feel hurt people reaching absence invites stuff? Like enjoy go parties want to, ego misses invite. Post history suggests they're making backdoor voter id comment. literal concern stopping spread COVID. really area expertise, lens view life through. mean rest us same. vaccines incredibly effective really make sense average person fret could doing. It'd like revolving entire life around automotive safety; sure, could always drive five miles speed limit, never drive within 24 hours drinking alcohol, never music car, avoid ever driving busy times highways, etc. might ever slightly safer overall. ""wear seatbelt, obey traffic laws, observant, drive drunk"" enough keep almost safe, lot less stressful fretting every move make.

Also Osterholm loon predicts new surge every time sees shadow. sooner stop taking seriously, better. tropical storm Cat 5. great, batten hatches, weathered. apply me. Apparently pandemic living sweet spot. exact introverted lifestyle lived prior, people get mad wanting go out. Completely ignorant law. 

Non-vaccinated people constitutionally protected group.

Proof Measles vaccine required enroll school play baseball. 

Good thing too, you‚Äôre vaccination status implications someone else‚Äôs health, yours. know grandmas grandpas prioritized ag workers right? california particular 79% 65+ gotten least 1 shot APA endorsing person learning bc many risk children due circumstances homes. Many children meals school abusing unstable home life. IMO fueling majority ‚Äúkids safe school!‚Äù agenda. Kids flying radar unless symptoms bad enough tested. going test child minor cold symptoms. see numbers rise household members catch it. Unless kid unlucky one get MIS-C severe symptoms. B.1.1.7 common variant worldwide. contagious far know. place reported places poor surveillance like Saharan Subsaharan Africa Central America parts South America. That's great could've gone shot basketball outside park last summer amount covid risk, say next-to-none. 

I also got first shot week half ago nice sit inside restaurant day care people tables talking loud aerosolizing microdroplets. think high information commentators nuance efficacy rates lot people interested one shot. polite virus coworkers. We've access N95s, gloves, sanitation, coworkers sick virus practicing habits have. make sense news, water wet. Wow, creep. Nice job stalker. Lol. Looks like can‚Äôt read either comments up, literally said met qualification. Go troll elsewhere. said due number rising cases across country. MIGHT infect unvaccinated people. bar looks like sucks child medically fragile, worry much it. translation 1 year least plague. I'm sure square division German company Merck KGaA (MRK.Germany), said April 14 would work manufacturing vaccine Jenner. Oxford Biomedica (OXB) also working manufacturing vaccine. I'm middle aged. felt like mild flu me, starting 24 hours shot. Fever, headache, icky. 48 hours shot totally fine again. actually liked knowing something. Sounds like you‚Äôre spinning narrative fit world view. Maybe masks aren‚Äôt effective large groups people aren‚Äôt using n95s thrown away use. Couldn‚Äôt though, science settled right. one number paints much rosier picture. remember correctly target Speranza set 14 million doses administered end April definitely that. tracker says line stime del governo.

I think particular article bit 'glass half empty' outlook. love sole24ore sometimes could word things better IMHO. Maybe even earlier tbh, that's current rates hold Finally got appointment days days trying- Wednesday @. 10 am- J&amp;J Rite Aid- excited face. palm. saying. bad time go: uh told so?

Louisville situation already vaccinated teachers opening 16+ tomorrow. really depends demographics. I‚Äôm sure best possible, every area different. outrageous shit that‚Äôs coming pie hole gets clicks ratings anyone carries it. Dude shit confusing. I‚Äôm seeing posts talking 4th wave, I‚Äôm seeing CNN reporting Fauci saying remove masks Memorial Day. habitual fuck going on?! nah send back school say, development stunted say.......should keep going? shit sucks agree government hasn‚Äôt perfect vaccinations really bad. we‚Äôre basically month two behind us uk, pace per capita closing rates going go wonderful news!! assumed kids would follow distancing guidelines based personal experience kid, many years ago. I'm glad kids today like was. Oh- oh god. Ugh. just- mental image. Wow. HCQ works within hour. Interesting. really defense though. uninfected, encounter someone ""spreader"" droplets /aerosol get nose/mouth, got it. curve supposed look like hockey stick taken seriously? 

Not even Canada. awesome! See get HCQ, done great things India 50 years! teachers vaccinated county. unions voted go back happened. choice reopening schools racist duh Also, may mean much coming stranger internet lot frustrations voiced also felt lot last year. I'm sure there's millions millions others feeling way across world. think brings us together way since lot us felt feelings solitude, confusion, anxiety, anger.

So anyway, hugs internet stranger another, *hugs*, hopefully we'll laughing hugging spending lot time friends, family, loved ones soon! Good know. Thanks! Adults different though, entered work force job WFH, much intrinsically (and economically) motivated work. Plus probably either close, fully mentally developed (25 years).

One week. see boomers bars, restaurants shops buying it. flooded place things sort opened summer. order groceries stuff online vet people visit voluntary quarantine testing etc. 

What happened high risk people dumped risk onto people expected kinds freedom. That's obnoxious deserves respect. much would guys make HCQ sales? Man that‚Äôs good idea. takes back one first times quitting got addicted Mars ice cream babybels instead üòÇ really help something else around.

""Cautiously"" broad term. ""cautious"" level could far different yours, anyone else.

The level justifiable caution varies according individual. 90 year old respiratory issues, justifiable caution would high. healthy 35 year old real life, level justifiable caution relation covid extremely low, lifestyle since May 2020 reflected fact.

Most people need worried Covid. Unfortunately, thanks media, people impression covid far serious personal health actually is, fair number gone far shame others share level concern virus. That's people eating whatever questionable prophecies Osterholm serving here. Lol think assumption approved widely available time fall semester rolls around. It‚Äôs double work teachers. Can‚Äôt say sub wants triple masked inside till end guy speaking facts, FDA yet approve vaccine one week away first dose. kids day care. Fuuuuuuuuuuuuck. household covid, wearing masks around inside home? possibly lessen viral load time goes symptoms, any, develop? link CDC guideline something like this? Yep. got appointment booked Wednesday. I'm pumped. barely BMI 25 (6 foot 1/2 inch @ 188.5lbs 25.2 BMI), weight lifting lol. Really dumb reason technically qualify, make dumb rule, state did.

Now I‚Äôll agree Michigan surge. actually wonder they‚Äôre part largely spared much past year Bro masks till 2030 maybe go distanced bar beer ziplock pouches can. Woah woah woah. 

You go around throwing shade like that. jawless immunities, too. 

That jaw-droppingly inappropriate, sir. Poor Ron, sucks bad can't even make worst list. gifted natural Florida Ron needs work harder bad wants stand out. Florida done good job vaccinating seniors. Maybe NY NJ could take notes Florida. certainly hope so, given sensible option. things companies better at. Pushing purchase use product service definitely one things. vaccines aren‚Äôt good enough, taking them? state, exactly that: say name, name address. Absolutely checks otherwise. idea exactly many people take advantage system clearly easy system abuse. U.S. lot flaws comes election security general. partisan issue. Everybody favor election security laws. dunno I'm essential worker still travel daily every place I'm seems pretty busy... likely covid outbreak pandemic? makes ortolans taste much better Really? employees' discretion wear, general sense. allow businesses dress codes infringe people's personal freedoms extent. mandate wear suit tie.

Then many people private business requiring masks? could fall dress code too. private institution required opposite?  shapeshifted lizard sacrificed children dark ritual Hillary Clinton. Great job explaining Publix exclusively chosen CVS, Walgreens company. hear cvs? need pay Florida get noticed. Maybe Becky could explained 60 minutes data supported DeSantis choice Publix. Clearly high mortality rate Florida's wealthy elite compared healthy untouched poorer communities real concern. Ron let Becky prison yet? sure stats would clean misunderstanding. Where's done? We're open Oregon sort random testing. opt-in sort testing even kid directly exposed. There's way we're going understand extent spread happens K-12 Schools opening. Adults getting vaccines. awesome, thank you! Astra Zeneca sort counter argument though correct? clotting condition probably rare come trial seem common otherwise expected wider scale vaccination volume. well like agreed, fraud extremely rare dont see argument all. doesnt happen states without ridiculous id laws, would expect happen anywhere else? either way, id laws, also vax vote laws rock, thanks! Yeah, need better messaging metric-based guidelines public health officials public figures general. Saying things like ""masks distancing still required campus even herd immunity"" makes anti-mask people (as well sorts conspiracy nuts) go ""I right!"" one reason (of several) extremely foolish advocating policies continuing herd immunity. would utterly stunned case. many us predicted year ago, get less less compliance time lock down. point, I'd imagine get effectively none (""effectively"" meaning terms epidemiology; I'm sure Parisians good girls boys til end).  Oh we‚Äôre still talking laminating see? also said don‚Äôt wear masks flipt script Im either getting vaccine wearing masks. One both. Lol already posted Please refrain posting old articles future. Thanks! agree you. It‚Äôs like peoples inability 100% predict exactly pandemic play makes think it‚Äôs somehow pointless take measures all. Nope like idea either. mail ballots people want vote person argument dumb. see issue saying name proof address. restrictions obviously saying ways make easier can't vote person so. think restrictions ridiculous voting serious thing. want know vote counted mattered. Also like said gonna sit discuss voter fraud lack it. surely getting rid kind restrictions make easier. feel like thats common sense like bars longer required show ID underaged kids drinking bars. never fake back day would drank bars knew carded. like absolutely restrictions voting probably would inclined vote multiple times feeling particularly zealous candidate. Yeah, mean sense ""oppressive"" way, wearing masks distancing reason (note reason now, we're talking future be) seems like type odd / slightly society would show episode show. uncanny valley effect everything almost normal, quite. close losing grip also focused wealthy. probably opening they're concerned people's safety. different experience, community College professor amazingly adapted. feel classes better before. wish daughters school adopted well. painful watch zoom classes. don‚Äôt believe L452R considered escape mutation. far know that‚Äôs similar N501Y lineage B.117 means plays greater role infectivity. evidence this; California variants don‚Äôt really show major antibody evasion capabilities, it‚Äôs slightly greater B.117

E484K escape mutation, even B.1.135 K417N also likely aids antibody evasion. E484Q also isn‚Äôt exactly E484K similarities it. public infrastructure non existent America California leading way vaccinations like 1% positivity rate currrently lol [Read fucking dictionary go mouthing people wish would wound wrong side covid... mean, call Black Mirror episode Seems superior ""I'm getting vaccine matter what"" way thinking.

Don't bother replying. I'm blocking 'cause asshole quotient high me. Here's problem: next time humanity deals raging pandemic absolutely one's gonna listen experts anymore. They've really shit bed, honest. They're trying hard -- get it, really -- persuade people maintain distance wear masks little longer. end they're immense damage institution science Western society. logic, private business require employees wear suit tie work either.

Well leap logic. original two comments *can* do. ""Should"" suggestion. There's big difference ""can"" ""should"" do. keep mind that's significant here.

For example, people say Biden **should** institute nation-wide mask mandate. However, given laws constitution set up, **can** not. ""Can"" describes ability something, ""should"" describes whether thing good idea.

Now language lesson employees discretion want wear, yes?

No, employees' discretion wear, general sense. allow businesses dress codes infringe people's personal freedoms extent. **can** mandate wear suit tie.

Your claim weird. Private businesses **cannot** whatever please. variety rules regulations country imposes businesses. example, see dress codes. Alternatively, government mandates certain safety standards, overtime pay work 40 hours week, mandate breaks. mandate businesses comply variety things. I‚Äôve heard much effective theme parks amusement parks, still unsure since haven‚Äôt completed testing yet. Even though AstraZeneca become ""problem child"" vaccine, seriously save UK. data suggest kids 16 widely develop organ damage covid? You‚Äôre fine smoke weed put order magnitude money spent masks research heart disease would barely make difference, never mind cancer. DeSantis‚Äô incompetence cruelty doesn‚Äôt negate anyone else‚Äôs poor handling COVID-19. Kids redeployed physical schools plus fact go places see kids fucking masks  Sadly Americans (left right) convinced kids spread it, can't get reason distance, mask take precautions. 

This new going fought widely. Narrator: ‚ÄúIt won‚Äôt‚Äù are, DeSantis one who's effectively telling people go get COVID. that‚Äôs *with* quite serious worldwide effort curb it.

Had letting spread free would likely close half deaths last year (assuming 3% fatality hospitals overwhelmed, that‚Äôs probably conservative).

What‚Äôs tough it‚Äôs often mild, *isn‚Äôt* mild, shit seem fun all. could easy give entire bar pink eye. 

Maybe testing entry. 

How flu? Rhinovirus? Measles? Mumps? Meningitis? Whooping cough? TB? student rest us hope everything go perfectly return ""normal"" setting. I‚Äôm curious - basing on? Surely you‚Äôve seen stats thing hardly threat kids? proposing would constitutional 20 year olds die flu meningitis every year. Tragic every time. mean plan lives around it. know technically submitted yet, per companies plan submit data FDA EMA requested amendment Emergency Use Authorization BNT162b2 EU Conditional Marketing Authorization COMIRNATY¬Æ expand use adolescents 12-15 years age quickly possible. participants trial continue monitored long-term protection safety additional two years second dose. get vaccine, entered Federal data base? want buy plane ticket, would think need show something bit secure. would need something like ticket master ticketless entry. Call paranoid will, dozen ""just untils"" I'd call realistic. Obviously last forever, treated like flu I'll eat hat. 

Nobody ever given grief skipping flu shot, something tells choose forego covid vaccine given year given end grief decision coming years. part spinning? ending mask mandate didn‚Äôt change anyone‚Äôs previous behavior? ton people already Texas vaccines working? pretty measured response, don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anything wrong that. question lifting mask mandate. 

The thing is, I‚Äôve heavy skeptic lockdowns year now, don‚Äôt really know masks make much difference. Maybe do, maybe don‚Äôt. see day day Texas see. also went bars hung friends, within reason, wasn‚Äôt vacced. Don‚Äôt make assumptions. Absolutely. believe science though they're eager. mean, last surge never really receded. relative. still 60K+ new infections daily U.S. showed number half year ago would freaked out. completely one sided view issue hurting soul.Lots people know home educated fared absolutely fine life,a year 2 kids going damage say death family member would. I'm saying part third school year much, yes. mean, kid kindergarten last year. He'll second next Fall single normal year school. started one day week weeks ago. teacher told almost kids year behind reading can't form letters. dont know kids, that's way behind end first grade. There's lot things surprised us virus.

Some shit worth rolling dice for, much. gonna sound dumb but...did eat drink anything acidic/alcoholic day before? I‚Äôm female age you‚Äôre describing sounds lot like GERD me. I‚Äôve heartburn bad it‚Äôs sent ER fear. causes nausea, chest pain, shoulder pain, etc. 

My GERD often worse laying well, like described. Anyone else feel like it‚Äôs bit insidious use picture story? agreement person replied to. mean, literally know long term effects, any, kids right now.

Big period end sentence. six weeks late totally fine. day two early effectively nothing. fine.

So 28 fold higher limit. That's fine. Also, looks like T-cell immunity driving bus moreso antibodies, tests kinds immunity crazy difficult do. ""Science"" one sided. ""Science"" means lot things. ""Science"" means we're safer wear mask. ""Science"" also means 60+ crowd, ones ever danger begin with, get vaccinated, open things back up. ""Science"" means everyone wants get vaccinated get vaccinated, go back normal.

The problem ""science"" fear monger crowd hears science want - ""lock harder"" science. Try open rest science. We're likely take seriously. opposite fear-mongering. consistent throughout, since ~end~ beginning pandemic.

E.g. said schools open early. That's fear-mongering. That's recognition closed schools keep parents home thus threaten economy. Also children spread covid much less older people.

He also said many times must ""learn live with"" virus. also advocated closing borders.

Now, looking numbers. saying US look like Brazil, rather US experience surges different states different times, hitting people younger used expect.

Google ""Osterholm: Michigan serve COVID warning rest US"". good. 3 days 80% efficacy (or maybe already there?) 3.5 weeks full vaccine effectiveness. first week 1st dose probably needed vigilant virus behavior.   

You're epilogue ""Covid movie"" -- point checking time phone looking car keys leaving movie theater. 

Good take things seriously past year. feel like new person socialize ways describe first time since Covid hit. rest country far behind vaccine progress. Savor new freedom help friends/family scheduled yet get ""on books"" move shitty 12+ months. realize agreed mass scale mass surveillance testing low community spread general HIPAA better. It‚Äôs it‚Äôs everywhere. go coffee shop something? Yes. CNN article getting vaccinated choice

And choice unable take vaccine whatever reason.

Those people luxury choice do. right anybody take vaccine refuse vax passport put people risk?

If want take vaccine produce passport that's great you.

It's like anchored news 2019...

I friends die covid due negligence people like you, wearing cloth face big burden. seriously fuck off.  You‚Äôre bit paranoid. pandemic next year, anti vaxxers worry covid. rest us living normal, maybe wearing masks crowded places maybe yearly visit dr top vaccine that‚Äôs basically it. agree wearing mask isn‚Äôt hard, state absolutely trade-offs exist disingenuous inherently ableist. Many hard hearing individuals (one fairly close with), example, rely lip reading. way attempting argue mask usage, pointing comment reeks ableism ignoring mask usage, fact, resulted trade-offs several individuals myriad reasons.  sounds like problem type mask wearing - masks per se. Try cotton one made natural fibre. get wet sticky cause face rashes. Even we're vaccinated, still true strains Covid-19 used make *older* version vaccines made fight.

You you. people administering shots gotten *lot* practice lately! moved current city, know best doorknobs are. locals pointers? know 4th wave 60K+ new infections daily certainly suggests stuff still spreading relentlessly USA. need wait till then

people waiting till then. say utmost confidence indeed incredibly fatigued. Coward Re-read comment. lift restrictions vaccines distributed everyone wants one, sadly put side lot yahoos adamant whole thing control. months ago, suggested Govt. wanted introduce vaccine passports, invariably labelled ""CoNsPiRaCy ThEoRiSt"". 

Ok, going now? begginning pandemic barely knew anything future.

People reddit tell trustworthy they're reddit. doesn't. Unlikely cases still 60,000 day unlikely like 1000 week whatever different things. Vaccinations first part this. Getting cases go next. one asking 100 efficacy, considering 3 year old can't get vaccinated... I'd really like cases go down.

No aren‚Äôt. Sorry dude. Dentists experts vaccines? Gotta fake news guys, let's forget- we're following science now, CDC says we're fine:

Gotta feel bad fear mongers, day sun over. Wait wait wait. Hold Osterholm said. ""At point, see next two weeks highest number cases reported globally **since end pandemic.**

The pandemic ended? mean here, typo? idiot. Why? Huge agree. past winter ROUGH. Short dark days. weeks didn‚Äôt even time go outside daylight. spent winter sitting desk (online school), ended walking less workload/snow (avg 1-2k steps/day versus 12-15k steps/day summer). Gyms risky kept getting shut cases exploded. gained bit weight it‚Äôs slowly coming now. 

Thankfully, weather finally warming again, daily cases/variants averaging higher pandemic started, we‚Äôre back month long ‚Äúlockdown.‚Äù started opening vaccines 70 year olds here, friends states already fully vaccinated. It‚Äôs pretty dismal. I‚Äôm hoping get first jab July. 

Take care, keep holding on! I‚Äôm staying optimistic we‚Äôll get something break summer. Rona devilish variants downvoted me. ::angrily shakes fist:: Exactly propose vaccinate, then? What's specific vaccination plan? We're vaccinating 5000% people day getting infected day. 

So bet it. Nice see support lying get shot! Noted, reported. Honestly, stop worrying adults. It‚Äôs child‚Äôs job continue quarantine ‚Äúprotect‚Äù older people vaccines presumably going world ppl choose vaccinated. 

Flu still way bigger risk child age guarantee adult ever locked winter keep kid getting sick. 

I know lot brainwashing gone on, need what‚Äôs best child - world playing others experiencing things - enough insanity. Nice know support lying get shot. Noted, recorded, reported. Good luck! Cool, pay teachers double current salary maybe it‚Äôs worth work It‚Äôs ‚Äúcherry picking‚Äù argue flu lower risk kids choose bad year flu? Lol, ok. Actual cherry picking would chose year really low deaths, suggest flu isn‚Äôt dangerous. Regardless, chose year recent competed flu season.

Regardless, image posted suggest covid risk children. suggests 100 kids flu 100 kids covid, kids die flu. grant that. problem flu normal year spread like covid right now. Way, way people getting infected covid winter get infected flu normal year. That‚Äôs number kids died covid year higher number normally die flu. Hopefully vaccines give us herd immunity, won‚Äôt case. covid rates low, agree don‚Äôt need worry much kids. aren‚Äôt yet, don‚Äôt think kids vaccine. That‚Äôs think it‚Äôs reasonable ask adults go normal activity, wear mask kids get vaccine. It‚Äôs pretty small ask. Even only, say, 90% effective, given choice, would much prefer 90% protection covid 0% protection. so? think pretty hard think anyone know shot.

I don‚Äôt shot (I‚Äôm eligible tomorrow), could say know me, fellow Reddit user /u/lifeinaglasshouse. admit, vaccinated looking around vaccinated people, going bar vaccinated patrons sounds pretty nice right? happens dog gets covid loses sense smell? Terrible - read ""mutants behavior blame"", thinking conventional 'human' mutants running around India spreading disease. may off-the-cuff remark internal conversation got leaked somehow, e.g. someone forgot hang line end tense conference call. Would say accurate cost calculation? Sounds like change positive recommended move 2nd dose, fine push week after. I'm sure exactly Publix scheduling hard find another opening three weeks out. Hell people. Uh huh. Every vendor planet- defense contractors bridge builders- going demand upfront payment Israel Israel keeps up.

Not country honestly care, going problem. 

Also, Pfizer probably getting ready yo sue Israel speak UD courts seize foreign assets has. US corps like mafia- get money, one way another. Still UK started vaccinating Israel, matter impressive numbers are. 

The fact vaccinated per capita, mean first one start vaccinating using Pfizer. Okay admit, news articles like bring smile haha. 

Glad they're vaccinated! don‚Äôt care you‚Äôre Jewish, doesn‚Äôt make racism ok. opposition rooted mix religious faith longstanding wariness mainstream science, fueled broader cultural distrust institutions gravitation online conspiracy theories. sheer size community poses major problem country‚Äôs ability recover pandemic resulted deaths half million Americans. evangelical ideas instincts way spreading, even internationally.

That includes everything vaccines tied so-called ‚Äúaborted cell tissue‚Äù, illness/health ‚ÄúGod‚Äôs will,‚Äù distrust vaccine science works (experimental), generalized sense ‚Äúoppression‚Äù (including mask mandates), dichotic thinking (fear vs faith, good vs evil, right vs wrong, etc). really fail understand ""superpower"" dumb &amp; idiotic people. careful take Uber get ride someone else. Otherwise could simply move appointment days week two. Wait minute ? free save lives ? Covid would worse side effects. totally fine. Get shot! use waiting. Side effects nothing. Good news, surprisingly low.

Additionally, swing next months. false. Stop spreading bad move appointment, delaying would better moving up. 

Is Uber/Lyft option? FDA's official stance right vaccinate kids. mean FDA anti-vax? #propalestine  there's high rates vaccination risk congregating people even masks distancing. think would feasible completely closed nonessential activities past year, certain point people responsible risk taking. Plus even know contracted game. traveled ~500 miles attend there's photos huddling around people unmasked. think that's problem, government trouble making decisions moment.  read article paints good picture solid reasoning back up, time I'm listening Fauci saying genuine reasons least cautious variants, understandable.

I'd say think genuine doom heading way, simply continue wear masks socially distance necessary benefit worrying dying anymore wearing masks since we're vaccinated lol. get serious global vaccination. support vaccine manufacturers testing potential boosters contend variants aggressively evaluate breakthrough mechanisms vaccinated folks get infected. sequence virus infected folks proactively identify spread variants (we particularly crap job US, ignorance bliss).

and love holy, get vaccinated turn! stop spreading shitty misinformation that's making people vaccine hesitant. super easy get vaccinated wild number people declining üòí Proof pudding.

During global pandemic, vaccines free, period. AstraZeneca used year, though, making like compare numbers 1/4 yearly natural occurrence rate, otherwise get overblown numbers time frame due ""natural cases"". people time visit social media. must minority, either exceptionally good managing jobs, unemployed freaks. Considering sophisticated opinions, I'd tend latter two. Smart strategy rich country. Size really doesn‚Äôt matter. Wtf Oh you‚Äôre teacher... explains wanting go back job MANY HANY work country like UK free healthcare. consider right get shitfaced drunk pass streets overdose know NHS free take care liver failures. Walgreens told people state pick current eligibility categories regardless whether it‚Äôs accurate you. care you‚Äôre eligible day receive shot. past they‚Äôve updated day couple days after. Sorry can't see philanthropic argument shipments Israel. wealthy enough pay Pfizer. get paid countries actually money, going able afford charity ones don't?  see X-files tattoo haunted made man kill people. kids deserve school Lol seriously? store 16 billion? Hahaha, racism!

Hopefully one day realize personal nonchalance subjects might overall negative impact world whole. person fully vaccinated, literally logical reason resume normal life. think people honestly enjoyed pandemic much can‚Äôt stand see end, it‚Äôs really sad gross ask me. *If kids ‚Äúresilient‚Äù, wouldn‚Äôt whole industry therapists help people get things happened kids.* 

As someone lived physical emotional abuse kid, this. Public school districts feds tell maintain money flowing govt renovate schools &amp; keep educators safe.

Educators unionized selection variants start avoiding vaccines, (and will) demand OSHA they‚Äôll walk out/strike.

If business demand adults EUA, schools follow suit kids.

Yeah get that. look syringe second time make sure liquid lol. Shit, forgot Bob. I'd said ""Bill"" already Cult Bill Gravity Falls. Yup, that's true.

The best get vaccinated, simply get complacent get concrete direction. minor back forths going right know sure, long continue vigilant wear masks stuff we'll fine, might annoyed hey least I'm wearing mask additionally worrying dying that's huge plus time lol. obesity-related illnesses easily avoidable better life choices well? Well, Pfizer deadass collaborate nazis lol Ah yes ever-mysterious ‚Äúthey‚Äù. Ah, gotcha. makes sense. Almost every adult know vaccinated, got one route another. teachers health care workers food workers, health condition (which could simple overweight), security clearances, one food delivery person apparently qualifies, called around found ""extra"" shots late day, simply signed asked questions.

I know kids aged 16-18 shots, clinic area randomly started giving shots walk-ins, word spread people took everyone families eligible shot.

I think pretty hard think anyone know shot. agree supply really increasing. strong suspicion religious groups historically rejected previous vaccines also reject COVID vaccine. 3 weeks pfizer vaccine, could schedule come back school grounda used football games got kicked early for. me. bit pickle:

You right never explicitly said introduce passports, personally, thought would come everyone chance get vaccinated, point everything would open anyway would travel, basically.

Such obvious fear mongering quite frankly question want drag way longer needs  study indicates opposite, T-cells apparently able completely squash small amounts viral exposure. study shows people never tested positive, symptoms, close contacts SARS-CoV-2 specific T-cells, meaning infection T-cells able kill without causing made mind yet. facts, everyone knows hypochondriac, symptoms caused fearing side effects vaccine, wanting go hence producing symptoms makes avoid getting vaccine.

Of course factor everything said making decision, country system works like go anytime vaccine, doctor calls get specific slot. means big queues stuff, chance getting infected making others infected quite minimal, go, like go tomorrow, need wait turn again.

So tough thing say no, last time fever 1 year ago, 2 days ago big wind big temperature drop live walking hour without proper clothes, think feeling slightly (I energy, lift weights stuff, feel slightly off, cough, smell/taste, normal appetite) seem valid reason loosing chance get vaccine.

US summer wave like 1/3rd size fall/winter one despite less restrictions higher susceptibility. 

For virus like flu, enough take R0 1 fall/winter 1 spring/summer. could relative reduction goes spreading one person average less one person effect virus practically disappearing summer. 

As people exposed vaccinated likely COVID fall threshold there's little spread summer months. ~40% Republicans say get it: saliva swab nasal swab?

I‚Äôm scared won‚Äôt kids back full time 5 days week next August! no. come attempt misrepresent post framing way (what's agenda)? answer first question - yes. It‚Äôs much like pregnancy test, one line C negative. swab, stick solution drop onto test stick thing. easy. takes 3 minutes there‚Äôs 30 minute wait results (they show earlier apparently wait 30 mins full accuracy). 

Cannot answer reliability. It‚Äôs unbelievably depressing I‚Äôll still need keep tight little bubble I‚Äôm fully vaccinated. Predictive models give probabilities happen, depend people actually behaving way model assuming will. Policy makers want position held accountable inevitable divergence reality predict happen.

For instance, lot folks want say ""lockdowns work"" actually somewhat correct, question why? isolating people really stop transmission, enough isolation actually occurring, despite rules? People want ignore advice, enough do, there's bad outcome, people say ""see, told you, measure work control."" 

A pandemic ultimate game-theory trap society. Idunno general health anything it, I've quite amount unhealthy habits, eat like shit, never really exercise, really thin, wonder would anything probably can‚Äôt probably banking vaccine become fully approved sometime soon. believe Pfizer submitted data full approval. Respectfully, might help argument knew science behind vaccines instead repeating misinformation. explains they're full conservative memes, even far conservative politicians saying bad you. Put syringes bombs. Forced vaccinations. worth it

Sorry, sounds odd me. like vaccine nationalism?

You aware 7 billion people vaccinated, you? vector vaccines formal approval there. people think little less new guess makes less hesitant? 

I think messaging needs shift towards addressing concerns hesitant have. Educate people deaths metric severe Covid, conspiracy theories wrong. people. government needs foot check though, otherwise companies make things? Wait... could vaccinated already country given option pay equivalent one Uber Eats meal?  fuck em. got second shot last week. another week pandemic officially \*done\* me. people get COVID die care. guess we're gonna told Pfizer antisemitic lol. defending corrupt politician history racism trying hitch wagon donald Trump? sound like never spoken child, kids want ""mental health support"" want see friends. one saying Easter cause spike.  think testing changed enough explain change positives. think actual increase going on. massive large fraction people still vaccinated protected via natural immunity unexpected still pockets infection.

Your comment genuinely makes sense response mine. That's quite works, mutations happy anywhere world travel, nice read someone full hope. obviously going implemented

It might get implemented good chunk country ignore it.

FWIW, FDA awaiting test results 12-16 [This You‚Äôre miserable asshole enjoy watching people‚Äôs life‚Äôs get upended. people choose live life freedoms travel socialize rather kids buying home. hell would take joy watching able live life? **suggest** limiting access healthcare already is. main issue deal career daily basis. amount people cant even access basic care staggering need give insurance companies ammo so. 

You gave one suggestion motivation ""do right thing"" no, doesnt work 9 times 10. doesnt. healthcare! think limiting access healthcare based vaccine answer this? dont think understand healthcare system real exeprience besides patient. 

The problem suggestion arent thinking implications healthcare WHOLE. absolutely disastrous. US give money Israel, vouchers buy weapons US manufacturers. world's fucking patience. learned paper phase one. easy anyone get. Next I'm sure something electronic following science learning still stuck 2020 didn‚Äôt know anything virus threats poses? Well, issue health care costs. providing necessary motivation people right thing society's benefit. Getting vaccinated keep oneself healthy, contain prevent virus replicating mutating others.

People motivated lots things, money one them. ways think motivate people? Forgive stupid and/or incorrect I'm wondering reason seeing uptick cases among younger people USA significant % over-65's vaccinated (so getting negative test results), younger people getting tested regularly places like colleges/universities... basically bias based getting tested people vaccinated? Zipcar  idea exact terms deal Israel Pfizer. Israel already paid billions vaccines, discussion one specific batch. He's sort average. FL middle pack deaths per capita fairly old population minimal restrictions. anyone mentions ""hiding deaths"" something, excess deaths Florida remarkable *up to* 100 million white Christian evangelicals United States, total ~330 million population. fair, isn‚Äôt necessarily ‚Äúsmall percentage people.‚Äù China covering stuff up? Better question would China ever covered something up? honest 1 time? Bro everyone get vaccine health relate issues like allergies thought america export ban. need credit, money.

Someone tell US government. Holocaust hidden too. Gonna deny now? Same. remember reading top posts awful. anymore. needed one positive post, one positive piece news. grave. came back month ago bit uplifting honestly. hopefully lesson learn expand on. think safe say vaccine tested black people instance. apply one situation future situations doesn‚Äôt really make sense. pretty clear push everyone get vaccine. Latinx population also leery vaccine. blacks whites way framed group different. First stats clear yet.

They absolutely clear anyone chooses educate themselves. 

You know feel you. Nothing needs said. Yep. people can't seem grasp always trade-offs lose-lose situation like pandemic. Well banana part, seem like currently functioning republic. OY VEY ANTISEMITISM GODS CHOSEN DONT PAY. Ok, let turn ear, yeah sucks 20 something year know people think 40 year old got easier, job changed, things closed down, also lost life situations development. worst thing start saying one group better other, one group worse other. Everyone got shit stick except like 5 people top. honestly hope norm. get wealthy nation, shipping developing nations lack funds, companies face hell. think third jab? God piece shit.  mean great, people going fake vaccine cards.  going like people faked certificates dogs airlines.  shortage shitty people bend rules themself. goal posts (and always been) largely vaccinated population. 

This objectively false. goal posts originally lower curve, since changed constantly past 12 months. I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs shawarma republic understand US involved, always bananas us.  risky. procured one vendor. Israel 177 case entire country, 54% population fully vaccinated. US 18% fully vaccinated right now, vaccinations opening May sooner rather later. yeah idk guy conflating anti-vaxxers support M4A point, Israel's neighbors hated Jews since Israel even existed. Israel gave vaccines they'll probably accuse Israel poisoning them. europe, people previous generations (grandpas) 3 years wars military service (where 's either lot boredom risk life case conflict). Besides, world war 2 far. young people barely food bad ones, lots fears, traitors everywhere places (grand pas know horrible stories).

today, infinite funny instructive videos, video games, chats video mates, com'on ! immunocompromised people cannot get much benefit vaccine cannot get vaccine (I know someone like personally 30 see comment: quite true everyone risk accepted risk. course, much smaller class people huge cost continued restrictions restrictions lifted, class people able live normal lives achieve herd immunity people want get vaccinated consider part calculus decision -- one force based well others cost others. 2 hours partner drive weds get his. live large city doses closer. would I'm eligible 2 weeks Yes, specific case US offering one piece health care cost.

Europe‚Äôs economy shambles needs American Asian tourist dollars ASAP. Australia New Zealand probably still maintain stiff upper lip long possible, don‚Äôt see countries sustain without international tourism long duration without incurring massive levels debt. 

One positive impact overall halt international travel badly needed dollars start pouring US tourism market summer. Mexico also throw doors wide open. will. already first jab, late February, second jab due mid late May. dont think many countries welch them. see side it. People motivated right thing (in case, get vaccine) relatively mechanisms. one suggest use? think quite right. far observe, r/CoronavirusUK opposed keeping nuisance tests vaccine passports nigh everyone vaccinated pandemic country effectively over, going couple months.

The whole sub, however, **overwhelmingly** favour vaccinations, hands down, vaccines everyone _are_ possible endgame. reflects country-wide opinion polls well. UK one highest percentage people world stating get vaccine.  mean much. Colds caused hundreds viruses, coronaviruses ‚ÄúAnd things opening you‚Äôll never hear people worry mental health again.‚Äù

You‚Äôre right ready party put lessons might learned rearview. Fuck me! I'd pay 200‚Ç¨ per dose get first evening! huge number deaths, country relatively young population, suggests infected millions people went away running people infect.

I usually get heavily downvoted saying (there's subset r/coronavirus users convinced variants non-issue created media, despite overwhelming evidence contrary), yet hear anyone give better explanation would infect many people stop infecting people. agree part dynamic infectious disease experts ""their day"". part slow respond previous threats. Ebola good example, kept spreading becoming dangerous playing catch years. time finally stepped early enough feel charge.

My opinion led reaction virus experts somehow given unanimous decision making authority. Yes, dangerous infectious disease, also considerations somehow make forefront. think pretty vigorous debates response things settled. think quicker decisive responses kinds things future (and definitely more), can't lock entire world year ever again. US aid Israel spent weapons purchased US defense manufacturers. can't spend vaccines. No, Pfizer paid pocket. 

Incorrect. Berlin gave German company $445 million agreement September help accelerate vaccine building manufacturing development capacity home market. think you‚Äôre trouble following me. never said Republicans Democrats responsible atrocities listed above. last comment, pivoted UBL said religion motivator actions atrocities ‚Äúalways come back religion.‚Äù response, listed atrocities religious motivation.

Back topic hand‚ÄîI try balanced politically. look comment history, see don‚Äôt grudge GOP. repeatedly defended Ron DeSantis‚Äô handling COVID criticized Cuomo‚Äôs. said vaccine rollout credit Trump Biden administrations Biden give Trump credit motivate supporters get vaccinated.

The data indicates GOP affiliation strongly correlated vaccine hesitancy. need acknowledge want find solutions problem. data indicated religion strongly correlated vaccine hesitancy, would say thing religion. strikes strong possibility typical political leanings white evangelicals religion whole. No, interpretation right, I'm bad communicating. trying say one thing, came completely different. No, obviously see would assume that.
One communal control essential resources needed everyone survive society (you look insulin prices US see creating incentive private actors pursue profits health sector horrible idea).

People owning homes (for live in, is) problem. People leeching others funneling excessive margins essential products services pockets is. Gullible morons society! Ohhhh stuff believe ridiculous. believe anything except science. Jebus return take stupid people back Alpha Centauri? Kinda difficult costs money manufacture downvotes failure government issue order required ship medical supplies due internal politics good evidence medical supply companies nationalized. whole thing (publix vaccine fiasco) fell apart people caught wind it. Vaccines went pretty much everywhere. ultimately problem happen right still take major issue attempt. ""Exclusive"" word NEVER ANYWHERE NEAR nationwide health situation nature. undermines entire point healthcare system. no, it‚Äôs spelled ‚Äúpeople common sense.‚Äù 4th wave, like winter one wouldn‚Äôt read much doom gloom spread. Jewish them! that's case send somewhere else. Israel already lot vaccine coverage. future vaccines. elections happened. got second Pfizer vaccine. shot wasn‚Äôt nearly painful first. felt like needle going arm. plunge first shot lot painful. I‚Äôm paranoid didn‚Äôt actually get it. arm first little closer shoulder there‚Äôs less muscle. imagine. I've heard several friends someone they're close got COVID right around getting vaccine. One friend's FIL hospitalized 10 days getting first dose, means probably contracted COVID right around day got first shot. (I believe since released.)

It still takes least two weeks immunity build one-shot vaccine one two weeks second dose two shots (obviously protection weeks first). still stinks close. Lol... realize vaccines cost money produce, right? It‚Äôs neither greedy parasitic require payment services rendered. reason talk paying specifically 2.5 million vaccines. Instead seems insistence buying 30 million unneeded (Israel's population less 10 million vast majority already vaccinated) Health Ministry putting pressure government approve purchase additional NIS 3.5 billion - 30 million vaccines - even Passover government set convene last Monday.

I sure whether that's Israel's fault strange demand Pfizer buy huge amounts. people races skeptical. really hate constant need create racial division. Stating plain facts? time. Suicides also decreased 2019. Sometimes things fluctuate.

If anything impact though I'd bet stimulus payments enhanced unemployment. rollercoaster benefits multiple bills, provided people without jobs lot money would otherwise. convinced right I'm gonna argue lmao. change anything point whatsoever, makes feel better think superior position experience, go it. Well questionnaires ask symptoms say yes. could get tested show negative test result them. also mean viruses less lethal dangerous host bodies (i.e. humans)? Maybe send stuff us then? We'll probably miss payments well though. No, post comes across essentially making teacher‚Äôs fault virtual learning isn‚Äôt aside it‚Äôs aspects

You're pulling absolutely nowhere. point say teacher's fault same. Read comments actually replying to. person responded said: That's true, matter tech savvy teacher/student is, still can't provide aspects schooling. 1 1 help, 

It objectively wrong say teacher *can't provide* 1-on-1 help matter tech savvy are. factually incorrect. Whether teacher chooses take advantage multiple ways connect student individually online another issue entirely, functionality there, even though, *literally acknowledged comment*, course exact thing. way track vaccinations physical paper parent could find? could see dangerous situation kid parent found proof going behind back. article specifically referring ‚Äúhype‚Äù variants evading vaccines, it‚Äôs saying variants aren‚Äôt real transmissible/dangerous paid yet last 2.5 M, question affording something, can't form government pass budgets. Yikes.

I know one reason entire country prioritized value early scientific data whole population vaccinated; hope data badly compromised. Pfizer multinational company founded currently headquartered NYC Pro tip: copy paywall site article url paste archive  Israeli government failed approve document required ship vaccines due internal political struggle.

Pfizer nationalized might good thing, would prevent kind failure. people can't educate need school. You, one people. wrong. Basically December Pfizer-only UK. AstraZeneca overtaken Pfizer, 2-3 months majority vaccines given UK Pfizer. 

The EU-countries US also started vaccinating Pfizer only.  Depends country live Since OP read article: lower hospitalization count comes 15% Texans fully vaccinated, according Johns Hopkins University data. federal Centers Disease Control reports 27% state's population received least one dose. forget $400 cotton ball convinced Vincent while.

Everything pointing small cold nothing covid. felt like million times really want miss chance get shot unless could bad me. wear ffp2 mask time cough all. sneezed 2 times today 3 pm here. Jesus, dude. Read last two sentences re-think that. Correct I‚Äôm wrong, UK getting Astra Zeneca. rollout Israel unprecedented scale many vaccinated UK.
It‚Äôs paying. elections happened 10 days ago cause situation.
The prime minister campaign heavily using vaccination point country got votes. elections doesn‚Äôt care. results in. It‚Äôs asshat PM Hard claim Palestine‚Äôs issues due ‚Äúcorrupt politicians‚Äù it‚Äôs occupied state. Kind like blaming black politicians failure reconstruction slavery America. Palestinians could well vaccine, Israel chooses prevent that. whole can‚Äôt fight Covid care always worst smokescreen around. people displaying combination sociopathic tendencies covered feigned interest plight others without real interest layers necessary sacrifice.  

I remember asking one person going lines reasoning discussion hypothetically realized society close bars (while figuring way make whole) open schools would think trade off? said ‚Äúwhat bar owners? patrons? people need mental health?‚Äù

I get everything ripple effect can‚Äôt conversations actual ripples hypothetical weird can‚Äôt anything Covid running rampant won‚Äôt significant ripple either don‚Äôt know do. 

Most conversations disingenuous best. Yep guaranteed think point threat public leaders enjoyed much power anymore. clear data available vaccine hesitancy among evangelicals racial groups. Wait ! Netanyahu gonna call Anti-Semite specially German company involved production vaccines ! People still continue wear masks. everyone needs government dictate behavior. However, really starting think need law people use toilet paper wipe ass well wash hands afterward.  F**k insert header 

‚ÄúI support ant-science voter suppression, call ‚Äúconsistency‚Äù realize ridiculous sounds move onto new buzzword.‚Äù Yes no, two completely different. read article see regarding last 2.5M doses Israel received. pay vaccines received. legally classified ""white evangelicals""? identify paper? learned yesterday one else immediate family getting vaccine, (well I'm already fully vaccinated)

Strange world since complain able masks pandemic stuff time. 90% efficacy doesn‚Äôt mean 10% vaccinated people get covid. means encounter covid 90% less chance catching Thank this, best luck well!! I'm sure there's reporting delays causing it

It Easter Weekend. Pro tip: Shaming people one least effective persuasion tactics is. Yes, especially vaccinated. see lot ore people now. ""[Banana farming one stable profitable agricultural sectors Israel largest among country‚Äôs plantation-based Even clarifying, still failing understand argument.

Every country Earth get enough vaccine entire population, get free. course. Probably EU stop single shipment companies Pfizer, fulfilling delivery commitments EU. 

Anyway looks like Pfizer blocked shipment own. Oh okay, post said ""hospitalizations deaths South Africa"" assumed meant vaccines effectiveness South Africa. Who's complaining? argument deal it. everyone else can't take it. Oh scared regular covid anymore? SOUTH AFRICAN TURBOCOVID Don‚Äôt worry California schools opening back today government take companies built people dozens years hard work lot money invested? Would let government take house without giving anything meant would used essential service? Tell people looking express depression they're going they're selfish also makes ass. Yawn us actually reported cases deaths, countries chose didn‚Äôt resources properly track them. Guarantee country outside maybe New Zealand would switch places us response robust economic recovery individual? Possibly.

The income stress, lack socializing outside household, medical concerns, inability travel, constant healthcare concerns.

I'm parent, plan reasons... yeah. certainly within right make choice, I'm trying confrontational please consider following biological information.

Each virus body encounters requires novel response. exposed meningitis make body capable dealing annual flu. exposed HPV make resilient varicella.

Since virus body encounters requires novel response, cannot simply strengthen immunity electing expose variety different viruses.

Getting vaccinated trains immune system respond novel pathogen *before* encounters it. immune system still work, able controlled environment. encounter pathogen, immune system know exactly mount incredibly effective rapid response. 

Regarding annual vaccines, reason virus variants. Viruses constantly changing time successful versions much likely continue spread. course year, variant virus may biologically different enough form previous years version immune system know deal it. 

An annual vaccine basically updating immune system new response plan. 

An annual vaccine two may annoying, benefits provide body immune system far outweigh minor inconvenience book. happen flu variants? Genuine question read comments think actually far comes China covid.

Did fabricate numbers? Hell yeah did.

Have people dying en masse since initial Wuhan outbreak? I'd say no, maybe different views

Is pandemic control China now? think so.

I've vaccinated months i'm *still* trying get back normal amount hand washing/disinfecting. That's sad. year chasing skirts &amp; playing football, locked room.

I'm worried kids turn mentally. people taking care I'm nursing home... Thanks OP posting this, appreciate article easy read, videos lecture series watch list. Myocarditis unique covid. triggered many, many viruses Sure, places open 16 year olds, suppose most. doesn‚Äôt need vaccine shaming people ‚Äújumping line‚Äù. Many states scrambling find enough people every single day use doses up. congratulate helping solve problem instead belittling public forum can‚Äôt defend herself? Yeah peers vaccinated month feel fine feel like odd one out.

People naturally biased believe/understand experiences stuff they're taught. vaccines switch ""scientists say vaccine X, Y, ..."" ""my best friend got sister got grandpa got they're fine"" resisters change minds. True enough. point take kindly anything goes pre concieved views world. know done run outta hands already mechanisms already exist, called vice taxes (Tobacco, sugar, etc.) probably right. I'll watching year +. multiple lyme vaccines RSV well early SARS trials end well (ADE etc., researchers attempted avoid causing immune sensitization protein targeted aware risk). But, wild virus exposure next season test. everyone fine I'll consider it. never ever believe models science. Models projections speculative bullshit. Clinical evidence matters. long term safety data one approved emergency authorization use. Still is. data exists. I'm sidelines.

I covid people getting much stronger responses vaccination. immune sensitization. exposed wild virus could get cytokine storm die due this. I'm going watch. I'd volunteer that, anything help out. wish easier way get vaccine people quicker 1/2 people thread refuse believe data lol Vaccines aren‚Äôt perfect, people aren‚Äôt able vaccinated, continued existence virus gives opportunities evolve way evade existing vaccines. Non vaccinated people absolutely danger vaccinated people still.

Just look flu example. Annual deaths US tens thousands range, vaccines 40-60% effective, need annual booster shots continued evolution. people vaccinated putting even vaccinated danger. could eliminate flu it‚Äôd save countless lives, reduce sick days, save however many billions dollars. fuck coronavirus could see another permanently endemic virus top. 

Bodily autonomy touchy subject. reasons refusal boil misinformation Facebook, cost vaccinated essentially zero, global benefit enormous? Yeah, fuck that. I‚Äôm wholly board mandatory vaccinations point. Especially get kids, aren‚Äôt able make informed decision point ‚Äî parents idiots shouldn‚Äôt give right put kids risk. 12-16*. 16+ get Pfizer Awesome congrats family! :) great news! together - vaccinated people means less covid cases means life becomes normal faster. admit kind losing reports empty appointments Stockholm weekend, authorities acting like ""I guess priorities, computers hard.""

I also doubt distribution partner access them

An easier solution truck vaccinations rural locales push community effort essentially carpool/bus interested patients in. thing voting drives. That's unfortunately risk vaccines need enough people vaccinated protect can't. think beneficial though restrict everyone b/c minority stupid vaccines may one *strain* many, many *variants*.

If choice two otherwise equal bars, one required vaccines didn't, I'm going one vaccinated people it. I'll vote dollar. would everyone know. Thank you!!! Yes, speak generally, vaccine stuff example, said probably said said almost anywhere else. Stats like OP fine, specified speak random articles/forum posts online than, well, statistics. LOL! favorite thing living love $0.60 wing night Pfizer allows 42 days 6 weeks. CDC concurs: second dose Pfizer-BioNTech Moderna vaccines administered close recommended interval possible, earlier recommended (i.e., 3 weeks [Pfizer-BioNTech] 1 month [Moderna]). However, second doses administered within grace period 4 days earlier recommended date second dose still considered valid. feasible adhere recommended interval delay vaccination unavoidable, second dose Pfizer-BioNTech Moderna COVID-19 vaccines may administered 6 weeks (42 days) first dose. Currently, limited data available efficacy mRNA COVID-19 vaccines administered beyond everyone going completely ignore everything vaccine rollout give USA UK credit don‚Äôt deserve recency bias. guess fail see risk getting vaccine. would awful New Zealand, hard lockdown two months everyone essentially paid stay home, mask-free (except public transportation occasional targeted lockdown) lockdown free since June last year.

We could implemented far fewer measures similar results limited social distancing (e.g. Florida/Texas even South Dakota, really look numbers) moving mountains testing/contact tracing, using methods like pooled testing PCR developing antigen tests (hundreds designs proposed/demonstrated academic labs) get volume up. would gotten us fewer deaths cases costing far, far less.

## Highlights

* Pseudoviral SARS-CoV-2 induces acid sphingomyelinase/ceramide system
* Inhibition acid sphingomyelinase prevents cellular infection SARS-CoV-2
* Neutralization ceramide *in¬†vitro* blocks infection pseudoviral SARS-CoV-2

## Summary

The acid sphingomyelinase/ceramide system plays important role bacterial viral infections. Here, report either pharmacological inhibition acid sphingomyelinase amitriptyline, imipramine, fluoxetine, sertraline, escitalopram, maprotiline genetic downregulation enzyme prevents infection cultured cells freshy isolated human nasal epithelial cells severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) pseudoviral particles (pp-VSV) presenting SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (pp-VSV-SARS-CoV-2 spike), bona fide system mimicking SARS-CoV-2 infection. Infection activates acid sphingomyelinase triggers release ceramide cell surface. Neutralization consumption surface ceramide reduces infection pp-VSV-SARS-CoV-2 spike. Treating volunteers low dose amitriptyline prevents infection freshly isolated nasal epithelial cells pp-VSV-SARS-CoV-2 spike. data justify clinical studies investigating whether amitriptyline, safe drug used clinically almost 60 years, antidepressants functionally block acid sphingomyelinase prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection. Yeah, 6pm curfew tons restrictions meeting up, nothing anormal. I'm pretty sure literal full lockdown back guess also real one since every single person locked down. Damn, comment perfect example creeping normality sets Sorry man vaccinating bunch rich people essential workers grocery store employees bullshit matter look it. blame understanding, China initial outbreak, idea like deserted streets were. idea talking clearly want actually know, never convinced. happily made mind, without actually knowing anything.

Those outbreaks incredibly isolated happen dealt incredibly fast affect rest country. no, can't say almost anywhere, fact say small number countries.

It's got nothing mental gymnastics, course odd outbreaks, like one thread (not hidden though it) comes well respond. zero doubt small number cases contained rest country affected slightest. also incorrect. asking amount masks wear order safe.

If vaccinated, safe. Mask mask. vaccinated unmasked person far, far safer unvaccinated masked person. This, well parents expressed concerns distance learning, social isolation restrictions effecting kids lazy people want parent kids. Nice civilized discussions native Chinese people idea happened believe did

... scale. Covid impacts everyone, personal friends relatives start dying covid, enough people start working around online censorship Chinese social media talk it? Take look - Chinese citizens seem managed form movement voice concerns CCP downplaying heroism doctor broke news initial outbreak slicenced local authorities. much serious issue people mysteriously dying place, think none friends relatives would take platforms like weibo (the Chinese instagram) share what's happening (and messages subsequently getting picked BBC Members international press recalled lockdowns began. little coverage requests get Chinese government difficult granted pre-pandemic. 

... think true. Especially covid something happens ""out field"" press still strong presence major Chinese cities (honestly heard reporters / journalists leaving China, covid concerns anyway), seems absurd negative news Covid China reported like million times (I mean western media knowing full well reports people want read amid asian hate). take look BBC report above. sound you?

Actually no. Partially Chinese government. Love hate it, power order entire county / district / even city people totally isolate period time starve virus. addition Chinese people experience wear masks SARS pendemic decade ago. even little bit?

Really no. Many asian countries conspicuously lower numbers infections deaths. China one. Taiwan like close zero cases past 6 months example. People Asian countries focus wearing masks instead crying Chinese citizens discouraged talking pandemic 

Again take look BBC article. sure u find similar reports say CNN also. Suppression done certain extent... many people country friends family dying covid. 

I mean certainly 80,000 cases reported deaths China, nowhere like scale places like Brazil even US u ask me.

Again problem saying ""fuck CCP"", believe covid pretty much control, judging things mentioned plus lot objective factors economic figures (investors world stupid) No, that's anecdotal evidence thing. Garbage politicians obstacle Could specific?? groups haven‚Äôt learned adult? post fairly vague hence useless.  me, warm even summer morning shuck shirt. quick change clothes maximum do, that. also electric bike, always use avoid excessive heat. consider June soon. two months away. 

Of course, given disease kill people within two weeks infection, two months going long lot unlucky people. 

It's relative lot Europeans seem think get vaccinated Winter, well beyond June July.  best friend Nurse choosing get vaccine. means anti-vaxxer, least political person there, cannot help wonder apprehensive vaccine. that's irony That‚Äôs fine. point, however, bold say we‚Äôre going back normal. haven‚Äôt gotten vaccine, you‚Äôre risk. Offer vaccine year round obviously think many change mind see others know get  Numbers wise yes... white evangelicals larger number blacks percentages wise identify evangelical/born whites. saying I‚Äôll try another way. get better results honey..... maybe didn‚Äôt blame group instead tried reach address concrete would make progress. media hell bent make evangelicals look bad guilty. push away bigger wall defense. many times inject PEGylated vaccine antiPEG antibodies start neutralizing vector causing PEG allergies?

This unknown, wouldnt count unlimited Despite success, emerging body literature highlights presence antibodies produced immune system specifically recognize bind PEG (anti-PEG Abs), including pre-existing treatment-induced Abs. importantly, existence anti-PEG Abs correlated loss therapeutic efficacy increase adverse effects several clinical reports examining different PEGylated therapeutics. Ironically, incorrect answer Snow flakes never learned adult properly, that‚Äôs problem. comes much ramp vaccination. supply really longer hindrance, think we'll get North 5M/day administered month. Eventually we'll hit wall enough demand think still weeks that. risk immediate, means monitored medical professional tools hand treat anaphylaxis.

With rare blood clotting issue lookout less obvious/distinct symptoms several days shot.

With immediate reaction monitor people expected time frame. something takes days occur, patient would monitor themselves. lot people really suck may health issues similar symptoms, makes things extra challenging. vaccinated, correct answer zero. already responded bad argument. Opening social distancing evidence outbreak lack thereof. could easily point spring breakers Miami beach say ""See! Looks like COVID exist America anymore!"" 

If capable critical thinking start turning gears head. Americans Europeans capable pretending outbreak exist even media government transparently reporting it, Chinese people could easily media government hiding much can. CDC better start making Tik Toks then... saying months, great major players getting vaccines start really focusing global vaccinations gonna play wackamole forever variants. facts data teens generally die it. So, prioritized people likely die virus? [meanwhile   know happen? like testing people living slums. young populations die get hospitalised since death rate practically zero 60.

Yeah build healthy habits power Side Effects Question: anyone else experienced nasal dryness/burning side effect vaccine? started maybe 10-20 minutes second dose Pfizer, come back times days since then. also experienced fatigue headache. reading acute nasal dryness symptom covid, haven‚Äôt seen mentioned vaccine side effect. Yeah, understand that. people totally healthy age essential work background get. guess took advantage leftovers something. know yet vaccines protect asymptomatic transmission"" one hears 'yet' even though diseases transmissible vaccination them.

""We know vaccines continue effective variants"" pattern

All statements solved, people still holding onto old news? lot small poor towns Publix. That's problem it. Let's also remind teens young adults world screwed still expects stuff them. Yes depression something happen us. world straight screws every aspect, decent working life calling selfish cause went beer 5 friends bloody square, also adressed. get started 'better days coming' phrase, cause aint. better days coming. struggle coming. 'hey! stuff selfish prick!'. 

In sort, natural depression world constantly knocks over. also shame give people false hopes tell expected side effect. wanna make feel slightly better? Give whole piece story. fairytail, teen drama, nonsense. unlikely break short term may cause needless stress. people cannot logic-ed bad idea.

What may work time passing example almost everyone knows getting vaccinated OK. friend asks open ended question, engage without saying told so. People's egos get way changing mind.

Sorry jam in. That‚Äôs it‚Äôs going work. local health department allowed write people acting stupid would put business long time ago. Meh, time US starts ""helping"" others, Europe needing much help anymore. would nice Europe supply rest world alone, though. antivaxxer. kids vaccines. need covid vaccine though. kids 12 times higher chance dying car wreck covid. risk reward thing. risk vaccine, higher risk COVID. Sick American s*it. friends (I‚Äôm somewhere weird Millenial-Gen Z bubble, born 1996-2000) aren‚Äôt getting shot aren‚Äôt getting it, least moment, they‚Äôre convinced natural antibodies COVID two months ago fine. could also good amount going on. yes, totally agree many, many reasons people vaccinated good; trying respond specifically point unvaccinated people accepted risk quite true. current administration Congress likely pass stimulus time predecessors makes think Winter shutdown tri-state, possible second ‚ÄúDark Winter‚Äù inevitable. 

The lack stimulus last Winter main reason lot states stayed open December-February. Dr. Fauci cautious ""ringing alarm bells"" variant evasion, concerns seem variants circulating unvaccinated, valid.

There's big difference Dr. Fauci's stance people want pretend getting vaccinated nothing help lower risk variants. Right. Ridicule source, especially comes educated people. That‚Äôs American way. guess it‚Äôs better believe Sean Hannity actual experts? reflection best ~~Vermont~~. America.

FTFY right, I'll believe see it, empty promises! never manage vaccinate everyone year! German government EU colossal failures unable vaccinate fast US, UK Israel!""

Or vaccinate fast Serbia, Morocco, Turkey, Uruguay, Chile... several poor countries fact started vaccinations well EU. 
Too easy cop say UK, Israel US points curve here.

Had politicians done talking, babbling congratulating contracts nothing promise, perhaps someone would believe now.  feel changes wildly pretty much every day based random things. days I‚Äôm confident behind us July, days I‚Äôm convinced won‚Äôt see inside bar 2022.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Medical conditions definitely take vaccine put curiousity, makes long-term risks Covid different long-term vaccine risks scientifically? Like know vaccines long term side effects Covid will? Since they‚Äôre virus, shouldn‚Äôt chances relatively same? need 5-6 weeks Moderna/Pfizer ones. time? 

If medical conditions, young don‚Äôt work around people medical conditions, there‚Äôs zero reason get J&amp;J one.

Think like sunscreen. J&amp;J SPF 30, people use fine. need SPF50 (Moderna Pfizer) burn super easily walking Death Valley day. productive without coming firm 'yes'. Going get aunt involved ( nurse covid survivor ). think hold her. 

BTW want give impression he's super anti-vax - he's cautious person I've ever run life. don‚Äôt agree. entire pandemic ‚Äúevery man himself,‚Äù don‚Äôt blame anyone gaming system little bit. You‚Äôre literally ripping dose away someone need. 

So many people deemed ‚Äúessential‚Äù bar unemployment benefits, people getting turned away vaccines they‚Äôre suddenly essential anymore. getting less less problem supply explodes, don‚Äôt think need moralize this. would call someone favors covid deaths restrictions? pro-death? hadn‚Äôt made things like wearing mask taking threat seriously political issues maybe could done better. everything suit narrative rules eh? never said nothing happen June. fact, starting next week, EU countries see doubled deliveries Pfizer/BioNTech. situation vastly improve April sure - June/July-ish get supply vaccines outpace demand. Pfizer Moderna delivered promised J&amp;J commuted 55M Q2. Unfortunately AZ different story. deliveries going high level vaccinating large chunk population summer possible, providing administering vaccines effective. 

I apologize ever sounded patronizing - wanted explain ramp happening, currently going less according plan. places already that. spread rural places, small towns, local pharmacists making house calls individuals can't leave places, vaccinating front porch, window. 

It's widespread program, lot quick response type activities, people put charge sometimes figure get done. Yeah, sure. Masks, lockdowns vaccines help. vaccines necessarily prevent infection re-infection 

But extremely likely so! numerous compelling reasons get vaccinated can't take away body autonomy anyone reason. would set dangerous precedent.

One example could eugenics. Control people's bodies government something never occur. support governmental control people's bodies, however minute, today could victims tomorrow. 

Viruses evolve regardless preventative measures understanding work. know efficacy vaccine current new strains found seemingly every day. know long vaccination lasts. 

Threatening force others take vaccine could lead conspiracy theories, even greater push back, possibly yet vaccinated choosing get vaccine.

In case educating people giving time see ok get vaccine encourage many fence. Fighting refusing vaccinated never change minds lost battle may result becoming casualties pandemic. right take chance. Oh man I'm soooooooooo excited travel June. It'll mark 20 months since last vacation also considered people suffer Internet reading comprehension syndrome. fault.

Given first post added absolutely nothing conversation, pretty rich. Yes. flu shot. arm immediately becomes sore unstable.Sore arm probably common symptom. Yup, means hit nerve. happened mom. calm day two. good. Got first last week. 

It's relief way immunity, instead freeform waiting last year. got notification possible covid exposure I'm trying evaluate proceed. 

Exposure event last Friday according CDC guidelines meet 15+ minutes close contact covid positive individual come within 6' (probably closest 15'-20'). double masked surgical cloth mask. individual consistently wearing mask properly deliberately keeping distance. 

But large room extended period, probably 2.5 hours, though vast majority time far individual enter area spent majority time all.

Out caution, I've scheduled rapid response covid test later today. Assuming comes back negative taking steps continue life usual? may come place privilege think masks reason stressed limitations businesses. 

We're getting point probably near full businesses masks allow full businesses without masks spreads icus overrun need limit much people spread limitations businesses need pushed again.

Anyways hope get financially stable soon friend Yeah, I'm 33, everyone know younger plans get vaccine, already got mine care. crazy little want vaccine. US? Yes anyone even sometimes works public eligible every state. Understood, start sneezing coughing post-nasal drip store even mask people start giving dirty looks... fully vaccinated vaccine passports. way surrendering medical information anyone besides healthcare provider eat restaurant fly plane. Hard pass. younger patrons bar 20 30 years old can't get eligible vaccine? Seems discriminatory based age worth, work big state university system northeast told classes back full capacity fall, anything in-person fall 2019 in-person fall 2021. fact, told directly base fall schedule 2019 2020, 2020 place contingency. campuses ""full capacity enrollment"" means ""no social distancing"" default, literally enough classrooms big enough enough specialty classrooms like labs run courses full capacity distancing rules still place. 

No word yet masks, suspect state one last universally lift mask mandates Covid rules overall among strictest one states got hit worst. think, though, fall enough people vaccinated rates negligible required anymore.  gf's aunt takes ibuprofen/tylenol allergy-related migraines reading medical community really know much decreases immune response. suspect decrease enough blunt efficacy, they're concerned performance face new mutant strains. btw, doctor's care taking ibuprofen daily basis? cause kidney issues taken long-term without monitoring &amp; testing. Unfortunately anti scientists guidelines still enough. want everything open right even would late. empathy families lost people. Really hope doesn‚Äôt mean goalposts keep moving children aren‚Äôt vaccinated yet. clear far side effects go? got j&amp;j 22 hours ago. free unlimited previously supposed getting tested symptomatic come contact someone it. (In reality checks could get one saying symptomatic wanted)

They actively encouraging everyone take tests twice week even symptoms. True. draw state state comparisons study, global aspect. That's awesome! I'm happy too. :D trials 12-15 seem going well far. Bankruptcies due medical debt.

However, seem hospitals overrun Brazil. Note forum r/Coronavirus, r/CoronavirusUS. Glad hear it‚Äôs fun watch people suffer I'd heartbeat worked around prison kinds emergencies responding job? worry regarding one. trying argue genuinely curious. Seems like much worry variants getting less resistant matter time one comes along completely resistant works? genuinely curious trying fear monger either. one referring wrote ""the devil here""?  ‚ÄúVariants‚Äù actually ‚Äúvariants concern‚Äù. It‚Äôs mutating since day 1 probably 100‚Äôs variants really aren‚Äôt concern. It‚Äôs variants one (or more) 3 following criteria:

1. transmissible 
2. severe illness
3. Escape immune protection 

B.1.1.7 1 &amp; 2. part Texas pretty much there.  Life pretty much normal now.  Masks thing past.  Every restaurant bar jammed pack.  fully vaccinated loving it. smokers, don't? parents' generation eating processed garbage 50 years

Which dumb right. eating basically corn syrup that's one thing/some things work great applications due packaging ala pre shredded cheese, literally nothing wrong processed food. Processed oils let get oil plant. cake mixes buy store ""from scratch"" cake recipe find online effectively ingredients. MSG powder makes things taste better bad you. Preservatives preserve things. Sodium citrate makes cheese melt rather separating. wish would stop bleaching things there's really point besides flexing wealth harms environment, bleached foods bad you.

And general, ""natural"" stuff repackaged middle ages medical practice. Humors, leaky gut, chiropractic BS (okay, later), etc. Millennial here, got 2nd dose February. Good thing majority us. Florida bringing vaccines high schools starting today! I'm sure states similar things month. exciting think 16-18 year old wants get vaccinated soon!! That‚Äôs factually incorrect, people using term ‚Äúvirtually zero‚Äù idea they‚Äôre talking about. Say vaccine 95% efficacious, means 1/20 people fully vaccinated immune Covid-19 spread it. That‚Äôs best case scenario. It‚Äôs also timing, take 13 days vaccine shot body build enough antibodies. People often think they‚Äôre free clear within days getting work prison sometimes go inside. put emergency services reason get vaccine? UK US least weeks far ahead first dose %. Duh? news? dumb concern, data suggests J&amp;J's effectiveness continues increase beyond number 5-6 week point.

Researchers also trialing 2-dose regiment J&amp;J, boosters variants, vaccinations children, etc. account questions. first priority seems immediate protection, get granular that's achieved. Hayyy... sounds like sucked... know much thanks sharing. friend tells latin American countries tend cycle left right election cycle, that's true? ... people getting microplastics eating clothing? Either way industrialisation brought variety toxins humans regulated. Vaccines going highly regulated. bigger concerns terms health implications stuff consume. Whether anti-vaccine rhetoric drives fear hesitancy. morons played pendemic start saying ""Only hundered/thousands affected, even problem?"" Allergies contagious respiratory illness. first priority getting base. remember reading time something like 19 first 20 stores offered Republican areas. people don‚Äôt fortitude something hard doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs impossible. Ah yes, good old *iT's fLu* argument. Unfortunately, not. Like many things US, state setting guidelines, majority set anything yet restriction-dropping guidelines. Uh, ‚Äúback normal‚Äù isn‚Äôt ‚Äúflattening curve‚Äù means. It‚Äôs never meant that. You‚Äôre deflecting. 

But I‚Äôm almost positive already know that. covid gets worse, know blame. people really go ruin things everyone else. Selfish people like part covid got bad first place. argument J&amp;J? single dose mRNA (80% effective) protect variants, J&amp;J (66% effective) will? It‚Äôs mostly allergic reaction vaccine happens observation window. do. dad panics whenever news story prominent celebrity politician positive test says need hunker several months. Absolutely agree going since days Covid. One good things come last year light that's shone prisons masquerade care facilities don‚Äôt get Germany gets April alone amount vaccines whole year far. 

Wow wish could see future. well may happen there‚Äôs always going non-zero chance won‚Äôt. Plus getting vaccines half battle; also need level faith German government something behindert distributing vaccines something simply moment.  Great news. hot weather sure helps. Pfizer area mean? though can't actually mix vaccines. getting 2nd shot AZ? Hah, yeah that‚Äôs I‚Äôm little worried about, stronger reaction. Hopefully not! annoying thing website doesn‚Äôt let reschedule 3 weeks since first dose

This thing really gets nerves. state already set date I'm eligible. able schedule appointment right date. wait I'm eligible even schedule appointment. Yeah, mean plan get eventually. I‚Äôm saying wasn‚Äôt huge rush. lot people know didn‚Äôt get flu shot year, it‚Äôs kinda like that. Especially gave large campaign contributions prioritized supplying Republican areas. AZ vaccine needs open back males 55... clots nearly exclusively affected women. See, there's difference: timeline rules relaxed metrics adapting necessary. thing currently exists states U.S., definitely huge part many young people taking seriously anymore. young person see I've noticed lot others start totally disregarding it, usually comes idea ""it's never gonna end anyway."" Reminds Silver Fire Greg Egan Agreed 100%. hold true Israel‚Äôs results global norm. virus start disappearing quickly May US UK. Yes, this. know many people generation (gen-x) reject Western medicine. do, others alternative therapies still see medical doctors serious things. know several people younger generations get routine medical care self-diagnose health issues based internet searches guessing trendy maladies leaky gut food group intolerances, attempt treat food restriction, herbal remedies, essential oils, listening certain sound frequencies, ""cleanses"". go alternative health practicioners, naturopathic healers, nutritional wellness therapists. ones reject Western medicine consider healthcare internet guided DIY endeavor, mainly involving food restriction, herbs, yoga. wouldn‚Äôt shocked. two doses trials time essence. even one necessary, wasn‚Äôt tested thus wasn‚Äôt approved. 

That said, seems like 2 least marginally better 1. got first Moderna shot March 27th small village Romania. No, spacing recommended 24-28 days believe. window. Yeah, that‚Äôs article says. scheduling system limited one option able options Anyone know much NSAIDs, taken vaccination, expected diminish immune response? find is, ""Experts say it."" take ibuprofen every morning, realized forgot skip morning first vaccine dose. too. insane anxiety read 4 days still acceptable. Also got really really sick second thought maybe took early think body reacted.  seems rising cases hospitalizations common states strong public health measures restrictions throughout pandemic. they're lifted, people reduced risk likely get exposed. We're seeing decline states like Texas, rise states like Michigan. think that's coincidence. think related natural immunity.

I'm trying make claim strategy better I'm trying imagine might seeing disparity like this. Incarceration? Gun violence? Mass shootings? US, probably end June. Uneducated republicans believe god one ever seen vaccine that's proven time time saves lives. Maybe something doesn‚Äôt kill children even affect them... Florida: Still average new infections (and rising), still average vaccinations. Great job, Ron. That's great hear :) Two weeks flatten curve! (Yes, changed...a lot lol) answer herd immunity. hasn‚Äôt changed. It‚Äôs approved 16+ right now. rollout still among best world. 90 percent countries would get solid f's using logic. Location important here. places already require masks. I'm gonna beleaguer point.

Can talk think simple QR code sufficient enough ""passport""? mean, what's goal exactly? QR codes spoofed easily simply screenshotted passed around.

Or, example. Take dad. name, difference middle initial. He's Goodyear A. Melt I'm Goodyear B. Melt. purposes, Goodyear Melt. I'll get 2nd dose vaccine Wednesday reasons I'd rather discuss, he's vaccinated. stopping giving him, taking me, vaccine card register passport? even registering passport giving access? Even pressed identification, would able prove legally fact, Goodyear Melt, even he's one vaccinated. think black market super common names like John Brown Bob Smith? 

And that's even getting fact CDC cards themselves, presumably used link register passport, also easily faked. I'm telling look print online write whatever want them.

It's stupid ass idea around. think most, all, states end mask mandates summer. baseline efficacy vaccine approved around 60%. J&amp;J perfectly good vaccine, mRNA vaccines really amazing vaccines. That‚Äôs I‚Äôve started feel it. May 6 two weeks second shot day take mask off. What? says confinement, means lockdown. I'm saying that's rules right now, I'm saying happened October. means wrong said stict measures since March. super coherent right maybe I'm totally missing something argument guys lockdown since March fact rules right also strict, opinion Imo weird deny. Yup. Every expert I've spoken become steadily less concerned variants time goes on. immunologists, virologists, epidemiologists: think likely current crop vaccines, especially pfizer moderna vaccines (and especially pfizer one), capable handling current variants future variants well. (Reuters) - New cases COVID-19 United States rose 5% 450,000 last week, third week row infections increased, according Reuters analysis state county average number COVID-19 patients hospitals rose 4% 37,000 week ended April 4, breaking streak 11 weeks falling admissions. I'd love see source saying that. got ass kicked first Pfizer shot -- nausea, fever, chills, headache, body aches. people feel absolutely nothing first shot. meeting up? vote beach! hit nail head. referring drawbacks adenovirus vaccines (AZ J&amp;J). issue MRNA. Israel see's better on-hand freezer storage 6 month testing comes followed monthly interval testing done see booster shot needed. Add 16 age group vaccinated yet. Also let's forget waste they're shipped individual locations expiration countdown happens pretty quickly. let's forget non-citizens work Israel inoculated also. Less 5 Million people double shot inoculated far. give consideration getting vaccine benefit others around rather benefit?  Look they‚Äôve massacred poor boy üòî probably worth pointing millennial, peers engage kind alternative medicine really access traditional western medicine meaningful capacity. might go ER something severe relationships primary care docs insurance either lacking nonexistent can't afford it. Sure, oils cheap-- ""treatments"" dirt cheap. lot times, restrictive diets nearly free compared visiting PCP-- ironically end ""working"" people, though usually reasons different they're it. know people gone gluten-free lost weight felt better... stopped eating burgers started salads.

I'm bit oddball friend group cancer 20's good insurance even among friends mine generally ""believe"" western medicine seem confusingly close relationship doctors mind. understand like doctors really listen trust symptoms report make good effort diagnose issue, honestly damn shame. still needs nuance

Nuance thing public eye since beginning. black white get-go. People either feeding public hysteria completely ignoring since, point, people built narrative head panning go. Anything agree narrative disregarded. Analysis: vaccines scarce, seniors world's wealthiest countries got higher rates.

This life. doubt offering forgo vaccine help poorer nations get theirs. anybody know average 2nd dose Pfizer side effects start kicking in, get them? 

For example Covid infection, symptoms start anywhere 2-14 days, average start around day 5. Basically I'm looking ""around day 5"" equivalent Pfizer dose2 side effects. seen reports 4 hours, 15 hours, know generic advice ""up 3 days""

I'm 23 hours post cautiously optimistic I'm one lucky ones feel like got hit truck. know I'm woods yet, wondering what's typical. Brilliant - put another week half state seeing steady rise cases. yeah yeah know. point even asking anymore. Masks stop mandatory people take freedom back ever choose to. somebody lives Texas, he's wrong. lot dumbasses. poll released Kaiser Family Foundation Dec.15 revealed among racial ethnic groups, Black Americans hesitant get vaccine, continue remain skeptical. survey, 35% Black adults said definitely probably would get vaccinated,  can‚Äôt believe come daily thread hopium fix smh experts say J&amp;J better T-Cell response mRNA vaccines, could result better durability (which appears Fauci concerned mRNA vaccines give strong antibody response there's another part immune system, cells, generate quite good cell responses. contrast, J&amp;J gives really nicely balanced B cell immunity. lot benefits comes durability, well ability protect variants. don‚Äôt food allergies, coworker numerous. doctor telling take J&amp;J. .. he‚Äôs literally every governor doing. need conspiratorial thinking one. But, accessing medical information confirming one ticket fly 21 years old. 20-30% even graduate high school

That number 15%.

But add point, one also consider likely college aged kid lie ostracized. 80% peers going it, lot lie intent get vaccinated. M27 here, boat scared death got panic attacs lot stress becouse Vaccination absolutely mandatory participate aspects public life 

Don't get vaccines traveling like Africa places weaker less exposed populations? Covid effect anyone moves fast, seems like wanna kind international flying brainer require it. ""church leaders""? Even ""evangelical leaders""?

Why include race? Fellow food allergy sufferers...has anyone received advice local doctors Pfizer Moderna vaccines related this? 

Or get shot monitor 10-15 mins after? Would love hear anyone that's also already received shot. Thanks! many confounding variables

This top comment nearly every thread cases rising/falling right now. So...you're saying acting fully vaccinated got first shot 1 week ago? Israel clearly reached herd immunity 55% total population vaccinated. vaccinations accelerate, much doubling every month. 

And lockdown would ended weeks ago new variant.  Rangers‚Äô home opener... hardly meaningless game given past year. Hey there. wrong, Trump got vaccine!

And side effects vaccine minimal, much better getting infection!

And vaccines work great! Cool story, officially done anyone restrictions mask wearing lifted everywhere, that's going happen new cases lower. flipped Rangers game. Full stadium rare masks. Crazy.   last week already getting much easier get vaccine NJ.

Well, yeah...they haven‚Äôt opened everyone yet. probably initial period people scrabbling appointments. also compounded fact coronavirus prevalent among general public since public vaccinated. know meme honestly vaxxed flu bigger worry later year. CDC said 80% one 90% two. That's said marginal. hajj umrah ministry said statement three categories people would considered ""immunised"" -- received two doses vaccine, administered single dose least 14 days prior, people recovered infection. totally right ask want I'll keep living life normally. What‚Äôs sentiment church‚Äôs congregation? people planning get, no? Prob worth noting Oregon's eligibility absurdly broad point. health condition CDC's comorbidity list (including BMI 25 and/or smoking) qualifies you. anyone household working outside home qualifies whole household. people actually waiting May 1st skinny, healthy, non-smoking 16-64yr olds unemployed WFH. people though? keep seeing everywhere internet actually came across one real life. surprised hear friend (early 30s) said telling parents get not, he'll waiting see long term side effects. even get J&amp;J anything, really thought he'd concerned enough seems worried long term side effects rushed vaccines anything COVID related. Least wears mask. really.

That age group largely done vaccines anyway. Probably Moderna Novavax. 2million-odd doses per week AZ produce UK going mostly needed second doses next couple months least. would ship 3000 fully vaccinated people less safe airplane hotel group 50% vaccinated people ? That‚Äôs pretty stupid comment honestly. real idea following guidelines not. event taking place stadium roughly size crowd Super Bowl didn‚Äôt see massive surge. tell one getting people say ""processed garbage"" usually think vegetable oil cake mixes.

I think potato chips, frozen pizza, hot pockets, cookies shit like that. Maybe add lunch meat list.

I think anyone's going argue cake good you.

And, sure, word ""processed"" much buzzword anything else. cheese processed? Pasteurized Milk? think would ""process"" goes through.

But people say processed, think mean little bit processing.

As preservatives, well, depends think salt whether think much bad you. Kinda thinking right now. ETA go back office, live alone real need get right away waiting see happens. need get it, I'll get it. vaccines optional lack education might play role. Chilean government release info vaccinated ppl week (Pfizer sinovac) hate say nightclubs notorious discriminating anyway. American get taste visit Australia. needed one go $20 (Australian). believe something similar starting soon want visit EU. becoming common theme..

If happen get sick hospital nightmare right now, isolated one visit you. People taking calculated risk avoiding hospital treatment vs risking dying alone things happen turn worst. kind religion separates white non-white? plan along even news. I'm hoping they'll make change well get behind me. Well lot loud ‚Äúadults‚Äù telling virus problem half country trying make harder impossible afford healthcare probably best expected. Anyway, isn‚Äôt percentage needed herd immunity somewhere 70‚Äôs range? They‚Äôre interchangeable. I‚Äôm pretty sure point it‚Äôs one 162 games - win loss isn‚Äôt big deal.  Neither. lot easier operations point view. say reality nah I'm still wondering two worse:

Mr. Laschet aiming ""bridge lockdown"" 2-3 weeks right Easter (i.e. tomorrow) ""so vaccinate enough people make difference"" (yeah, vaccinations going speed much tomorrow). Remember, Mr. Laschet, October told us there's doubt November's ""Lockdown Light"" would lifted December latest Christmas? We're back needed proper lockdown six weeks ago.

or

Mr. Spahn, telling us vaccinations completely safe (which aren't. they're safer, them, catching Covid) pointing according animal trials problem mix Astrazeneca first shot Biontech/Moderna second shot get second shot Astrazeneca. Mr. Spahn, said October ""knowing know now, need another lockdown"".

Nope, faith members government screwing zero. summer's basically full immunity reached. Booster July 30, full immunity \~2wks later. f that. get J&amp;J? Current IND Prime Minister ""Bang utensils. Completely Eradicated"" Hand wave gesture care could spread virus someone else helping end worldwide problem, soon ask one idiots would ban airline travel unvaccinated people, they'll instantly tell ""oh would definitely get it"". Save world? thanks. Go vacation? Hell yeah.

You may think sociopaths rare thing, make 23% GenZ Millennial population. confirm, 5'9 200 pounds (I closer 230 start pandemic, lost enough weight pants fit anymore, scale), still fat. anyone info testing numbers since dropped restrictions? Im work didn‚Äôt time read article full disclosure. first dose Pfizer moderna shown provide 80% immunity infected reduced illness. Imagine double immune population right now. Countless lives would‚Äôve saved. Dr. Osterholm correct IMO, I‚Äôm biased.

Dr. Fauci probably agrees this, it‚Äôs supported science, strategically doesn‚Äôt think would good idea change tone. American public can‚Äôt handle anything complicated 1+1 doesn‚Äôt understand novel situations require constantly evolving strategies. 

Both valuable insights. many people played risks unhappy kids home. legitimate reasons not.

Emily Bazelon Slate Political Gabfest constantly brought safer kids go back making Republican vs. Democrat issue unnecessarily swaying opinions, especially inner city schools kids need intervention. Also areas suffer covid.

I tweeted several times local school system go back October lost 7 people two months. 4 week. closed immediately reopened staff vaccinated.

I even get response twitter let alone podcast. Also correct I‚Äôm wrong didn‚Äôt Chile pretty lax reopening around time vaccine rollout starting out? sense there‚Äôs exponential growth they‚Äôve basically playing catch-up vaccines understand deity status subreddit already screwed multiple occasions pandemic. shit Updated congrats! 

I also found dates Hawaii Virginia. 1 state left... No, reason virus get less deadly spreading fine better new mutations. Yeah idk OP called meaningless. season started. know, game referring could difference playoffs Outdoor venue, too. thing spreads like crazy indoors. well outside. sub also openly supported draconian ""measures"" covid major source anxiety many people. holy shit, i'm exhausted today. want over. believe we're getting there, one days i'm feeling burden past year. They're vaccinating rate. places like Texas, likely already around 1/3 state infected. combination natural immunity increasing vaccine-induced immunity. 

FYI, I'm saying that's done. States like Washington Oregon little natural immunity, get herd immunity vaccines, without sacrifice many lives.  Yeah meant thread general, specifically. many people happy watching others suffer. definitely agree societal expectations don‚Äôt meet everyone‚Äôs ideal lifestyle, people actively relishing others‚Äô torment fucked up.

Congrats! has. AstraZeneca's Ramasamy et al paper mentions negative correlation anti-vector anitbody levels anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels. examples AstraZeneca Sputnik V also prove it. even collaborating combining two shots precisely increase AZ's efficacy. Gamaleya Institute (the one developed Sputnik V) use two different vectors reason. 

The plan simply use different viral vector vaccine booster. actually they're citing additional reason collaboration well. 

Anti-vector immunity might subside longer period time, vector vaccine may used longer period time passes. ..... Current CDC guidance says reason get vaccine previous severe allergic reaction one vaccine ingredients.  ""all people"" everyone keeps referring can't get vaccine? People immune system conditions get vaccine.

Relative allergic reactions, current data shows anaphylactic reactions running 5 per million. would mean everyone US vaccinated would expect 1,600 anaphylactic reactions. Also note waiting period injection ability treat people. 1,600 people reaction going die. 

Again, people can't take vaccine? even exist beyond thousand people country 350 million? That‚Äôs decided bite bullet get vaccine...so safely enjoy concerts again! 60 minutes intentionally misled people editing video make look bad. thought infection causing tinnitus? you‚Äôre willing show documentation get plane maybe shouldn‚Äôt flying. There‚Äôs reason need provide ID passport ticket get plane. mRNA went overkill turned better anyone dared hope, single dose provides good, least short term protection. trialed intended use, real. 

The double mRNA shots effective pediatric vaccines, lot ""give"" variant shows reduced efficacy. First Vaccination Appt confirmed. 

Terrified needles (even little ones, like covid) obviously I‚Äôm nervous heck Oh dear. sounds like crazy idea state low vaccination rate high death rate. Yeah. I‚Äôve never heard people getting flu shot prevent others getting sick, really vaccine matter. It‚Äôs weird covid became protecting others instead yourself. don‚Äôt mean bad way, observation. Sam Francisco going lowest tier pretty soon though. It‚Äôs ahead lot counties.

San Joaquin county cries Three different schools thought area: 1) want Pfizer/Moderna mRNA effective, 2) want J&amp;J don‚Äôt want go twice and/or considered fully vaccinated quicker 3) take whatever get first.

Around 5hrs receiving vaccine, back started aching nothing severe. arm still sore 24+ hrs later, really extent experienced. hope second one doesn‚Äôt come worse symptoms. can‚Äôt figure either. look map NYT dark red stops right Indiana/Ohio/Michigan border.

People lose hope world governments businesses refuse ""go back old normal."" You‚Äôre implying masks vaccines make worse? How? ""But, muh fear mongerin."" highest risk factor age. vaccinating young people profession older people income level wrong unethical. good news. wonder much low incidence associated vaccine oppose social distancing mask wearing. weren‚Äôt NY CA hit extremely hard early too? don‚Äôt know enough VT studies mid 2020 suggesting almost 20% NYC contracted virus? It‚Äôs almost impossible reach herd immunity without vaccine kids. 24% population 0-18. true. messaging ‚Äúmask mask mask you‚Äôre selfish boor don‚Äôt‚Äù nothing ‚Äúwe made much progress.‚Äù

Then there's places refusal rate high appointments competitive. guess July/August states. Holdouts wait September/October/November. Vaccine mask requirements big unknown. gap infection vaccination? vaccine receive? Would interested know, thanks think might fall 3M tomorrow. Hopefully 24 hours. Geez, that‚Äôs awful you‚Äôve experience mother doubt. Oh proven? wonder plan case semi-regular boosters needed. Idk bro, experts saying worry variants reddit users saying should... betting man, would go people study stuff living. think may change notice vaccination rate high enough herd immunity supply exceeds demands areas. Right now, still opposite largest population areas spending money pressuring people get vaccinated hard time finding appointments probably good idea. States also may want spend money themselves, federal government could again, likely waiting described above. make mandatory school kids pay every adult gets vaccinated $100-$200 bucks. alone would probably get us 90% vaccinated range. would still cheaper safety measures we‚Äôre currently paying for. sad. That's 0.75% fatality rate population. point Navajo Nation people like say virus dangerous flu. places virus went rampant, killed 0.5% 1% infected. Also RSV Flu less contagious, lower death rates! Since mild case flu result serious health complications going months even years? problem scenario still poses huge risk public health. large swaths population refuse get vaccinated never reach herd immunity, communities country susceptible outbreaks overloading local healthcare systems. People got vaccinated could denied treatment (or go hours way get it) unrelated medical issues neighbors refused shots taking hospital beds. 

You can't force people get vaccinated, understand that. really make every effort possible convince folks sooner get shots, sooner nightmare ends. getting vaccinated massive ramifications whole community, individual. really change I'm saying. health system getting overwhelmed unvaccinated people really something shrug off. I'm Ireland much lower level natural immunity meaning lot unvaccinated young people caught it, could require hospitals could handle.  I've heard NYC. 

""Covid going anywhere, neither we.""

YES FUCKING MORONS. LITERALLY IS. Total guess - I‚Äôm immunologist epidemiologist - pulling theories ass usual. 

I think view immunity vaccination % leaving massive part immune population - caught disease recovered. 

Now, please correct I‚Äôm wrong - didn‚Äôt Michigan strict measures 2020 Texas, less, let things run rampant? true might suspect natural immunity + vaccinations might something decreased resurgence now. Yeah could see that. like telehealth unavailable this. 

Also examples used, people paying $0 pocket therapy money really variable. pandemic mentally destroyed millions people. hard ignore normal usually involves wearing mask cautious anyways immune compromised. hope right. I'm used disappointed I'm prepared wrong. last Canadian long-term care resident offered vaccine received offer February 14. vaccinations take two weeks final dose become officially effective. gap four weeks doses.

So earliest date everyone could declared officially fully vaccinated 6 weeks February 14, March 27, 9 days ago.

And assumes everyone got second dose first day eligible, almost certainly case.

Can hold tearjerker headlines little longer? flu endemic around hundreds years. Covid-19 novel. ""B-but opening make everything worse!!!""

Yeah, let's find another solution involve sweeping problems rug? get work school requires it, too. begrudgingly. rest get COVID immunity old-fashioned way.

This also need vaccine passports everyday life, things like bars, movies, sports games. enough compliance make COVID very, small issue. simply need bring medical records, especially medical records break along racial educational lines, public space. create division marginal benefit. thinking too. Athletes definitely influencers many people seeing going hopefully convinces skeptical ‚Äúon fence‚Äù types.

This good news! Right true things like Influenza forever I‚Äôm sure things need change now. guarantee I‚Äôve part influenza ‚Äúdeath chain‚Äù before. Hell, maybe even common cold ended killing someone daughter part transmission chain. 

I covid too. health changed examples sides. True unvaccinated people catching covid, faster mutate fuck rest us new variants. Texas' 7 day case average lowest since last June. Pretty wild. Antibody testing recommended assess immunity SARS-CoV-2 following COVID-19 vaccination according CDC. Additionally, Anderson Cancer Center states that...

Hilarious! case, ask proof. Again, spoke 3 doctors last week none said this. last doctor told ""we hope case know sure"". 

So scientific articles reference? would really like read them. Done. Thanks. ""We've watched 6 months still working long"" way evidence ""you'll need booster every 6 months."" zero reason believe immunity suddenly, sharply wane 6 months. Stop making reasons afraid. may be, would also postulate anecdotally partner started therapy pandemic really anxious (I mean *were* wanted start therapy even pandemic), felt finally time find therapist much easier teletherapy. Plus lot people would money therapy unemployment going much. Gathering private house without masks vs. Gathering restaurant wear mask half time damn Neanderthals ... *checks notes* .... declining hospitalizations. Even height pandemic, nothing wrong going outside long unmasked near other. nothing COVID-19 control. Imagine end life also fully vaccinated still told can't enjoy outdoors. 

That's awful. I'd sue care facilities. people probably already consider loss one final years worse kind disease risk. Much less another one near zero risk. Evil variants!!! Ontario highest number patients COVID ICUs ever had. viral vector vaccines well established phenomenon. see covid vaccines well examples AstraZeneca's Sputnik V vaccines. see using 2 different vectors improves efficacy significantly that, using vector both, second dose barely effect.

Before COVID, people got contagious diseases like flu every year, healthcare problems listed existed. decided we're going shutdown economy combat contagious disease spread, live that. Like I'm healthcare reform keeping everything shut really anything that. also leave economic case tons small businesses struggling, mental health deteriorated rapidly, plenty industries dealing economic fallout

The goal lockdowns shutdowns ensure enough medical care people dealing COVID, acknowledging eradicated probably decades, definitely point. crux argument, healthcare system perfect. people are, opinion, justifiably frustrated. They‚Äôll stay home wear mask socially distance forever. Otherwise RIP. mean, combining different vaccines would probably zero negative implications, enough doses vaccines that's tested. clear, immunological basis combining vaccines different manufacturers even different platforms could harmful would hurt protection. pessimistic German nature. companies keep promises, enough vaccines give every willing adult least first shot early July. 

Removing population age 18, pregnant women, people can't vaccinated 20% anti-vaxxers leaves us around 56 million people vaccinate. last week 10 million vaccinated 4.3 million second shot already.

Predicted vaccine deliveries million according German health ministry: - 15.4|
|Moderna|1.8|6.4|
|Johnson&amp;Johnson|\-|10.1|

This would 59-62 million double shot vaccines 10.1 million single shots J&amp;J Q2!

With 10m already first shot 10m J&amp;J could give rest 36m first shot still 23-26m vaccines second shots left.

Until bottleneck vaccine supply, getting shots arms.

side note: live Hamburg local vaccination centre announced today used AstraZeneca supply. moment fast enough: went different phramacy second shot explicitly mentioned registered w/ IDPH.

Sorry bro.  comments announcing end mandate, governor supported mask wearing, didn‚Äôt think people needed government holding hands.

For lower age studies : 

Pfizer said want 5 done end year, quick moved 12-15 could see faster.  


 Moderna released modernatx :

This Phase 2/3 two-part, open label, dose-escalation, age de-escalation (Part 1) randomized, observer-blind, placebo-controlled expansion study (Part 2) evaluate safety, tolerability, reactogenicity effectiveness two doses mRNA-1273 given 28 days apart. Company intends enroll approximately 6,750 pediatric participants U.S. Canada ages 6 months less 12 years.

In Part 1, participant ages two years less 12 years may receive one two dose levels (50 Œºg 100 Œºg). Also Part 1, participant ages six months less 2 years may receive one three dose levels (25 Œºg, 50 Œºg 100 Œºg). interim analysis conducted determine dose used Part 2, placebo-controlled expansion portion study.

Chilean here. people vaccinated Sinovac country, Sinopharm. another vaccine avaliable time Chile Pfizer's one. indeed, lower efficacy mRNA vaccines prevent new cases. business model news media get many people clicks possible. Sadly, balanced, thoughtful reporting issues generate kind interest, they've turned sensationalism, clickbait, scare items partisanship. 

I've felt like along media helped create Trump period, certainly helped embolden people stopped listening caring news say. 

It feels like boy cried wolf type scenario, media, especially 24/7 news media tries make every story major BREAKING NEWS item tune see eventually realize mountain actually ant hill lot times stop listening, even things really bad like COVID.

Like look CNN reporting stuff right - #1 article ""How Covid-19 spread beach"" trying use scare tactics prevent people going beach.. nauseating. point herd immunity stop community spread protect vulnerable people can't get vaxxed can't mount strong immune response vaccine.

So, yes, risk covid likely low, vaccine might individual benefit you. something benefit whole community, know part transmission chain kills vulnerable stranger never met. Nah. Nationally appointments point pretty much generally available outside heavily populated areas time. time NJ opens things up, guess start fairly easy get areas well. country like Japan 485,000 cases easily could mixture both.

It doesn‚Äôt really make sense though talking country like Vietnam less 3000 cases. lack cases easily important reason lack deaths. think there's many confounding variables compare 2 different states. also say Texas lifted restrictions mean cities individual shops lifted restrictions. Meanwhile, CA, maybe shops flouting restrictions. Hot Texas means 90 100+. August, 90s sounds like cool front. Even low number (above 1) fine. body sort level antibodies, get infected again, body know create antibodies quickly fight infection. amazing many people ok people dying vaccine. okay dying coronavirus.

Obviously, die vaccine, chances equal better virus. 

But people debate all, results post removed, called antivax person. heat kill virus. Also sunlight. things. think nuance glazed understand 40% population going choose get vaccinated.

If already polls showing 70%+ population going get vaccinated, discussion/answer might different. Cries Canadian pharmacist pulled information database...they absolutely register information state.

Unless getting vaccine administered directly health department state absolutely registering identifying information state database.

If bad lot would administrator contact you...state governments played small role vaccination exception reporting pure numbers. federal government administers distribution, local corporate partners administer injections...the states never touch vaccines  long something like Chile avoided cases became widespread hospitals began filling young middle-aged people point 95% ICU capacity. possibility, hopefully happen. 5 million get year.... UK vaccinated 30 million people far 20 million Astra reported 30 cases.  20 million people 100 would expect get year. giving vaccines quarter would 25 cases... expected.... missing?.. would appear numbers clotting issues nature still within normal range. NY football teams played past season. Bills fans playoff games too. case food poisoning lands hospital gets kidneys, serious car accident leaves lasting injuries, hospital infection surgery car accident kills them. Fortune cruel. glad pounced (yet). comments reddit twitter full people saying political decision EU countries save face Great news. got second shot 3 weeks, good go. Worthless, meaningless, interchangeable. Glad you‚Äôre focusing important stuff. :) 100 million least one dose doesn‚Äôt qualify ‚Äúa good chunk‚Äù book? Thank you, thinking 8 sounded low, told nurse called results said high (but maybe nurse seen many high numbers). confusing! country made real moves towards actual vaccine card forged Kinko's. such, there's basically chance could get set time move forward re-opening process.

We going wait 0-12 crowd get vaccines. likely even wait 12-15 vaccine get approved line adults hit readily available stage.

We're going accept risk long term side effects among children can't vaccinate (since know there's relatively low risk short term) vaccines readily available adults push forward could see passport rule effect mid-fall

The re-opening effort still occurring mid fall. going basically fully open July 4th. That‚Äôs kind you, thank you! feel little calmer now. guess wait see outcome. Prepare potential panicked message tomorrow though!!! Haha one calling worthless. OP called meaningless. TX, FL fine warm nice outside (but hot yet, forces everyone back inside share air conditioning).

That explains lot. I've often heard seasonality argument looking US' cases July big peak, whereas Europe barely time. both? source this? doubting I‚Äôve seen anything saying CDC resolve beyond aggregate vaccination numbers. one value trusts opinions conspiracy theories come nutter subreddits.

You probably make alt want people give ""ideas"" level thought. Right now, look like one thousands conspiracy nutters. It‚Äôs opening up.

No matter hard stamp feet. Even shake fists it. 7th grade daughter wants see counselor. can‚Äôt get anywhere 12 weeks. Every place booked. Thankfully school re-opened, talk guidance counselor. 

The isolation stress tough adults, well adolescents kids. I‚Äôm willing y‚Äôall overwhelming exception Uh, no. Less half US vaccinated even one dose lot reason east Asia Oceania well earliest days outbreak strict border control policies benefited either island badly infected land neighbors. That‚Äôs discredit countries, quickly implementing enforcing border control hard. Good compliance mask use policies, local lockdowns Vietnam Australia, likely also contributed many cases.

The global picture though really makes question much US failure really result politics bad leadership narrative often goes. course things contributed, honestly lot explanation high death count may lots international travelers, older unhealthy population, counting accurately. fact states performed relatively similarly despite dramatically different policy decisions supports idea. Oh, good know ones things backwards. 3.5 months cleared covid, 75. Friends symptoms something around 325. 

I assume lot symptoms, body able fend easily, create many antibodies. CDC keeping track end. card get actually decide whether want second dose AstraZeneca want mRNA. newer smaller company natural Israel partnership Pfizer PR team they've come press releases data. said mRNA used similar would shocking results different. newest CDC data came last week (and covered time variants circulating) representative Moderna Pfizer. data similar enough even make distinction. Yesterday pharmacist gave second shot pulled info first one registered additional data w/ state.

They're tracking name, lot numbers, immunization dates, etc.

Why would think track stuff?  there's defective lot think going contact people?  Also announced fully vaccinated people won‚Äôt quarantine afterwards won‚Äôt need get tested domestic travel. goalposts? reasonable person always known order truly move past this, need vaccinate many people willing get vaccinated, including kids. I'm Ohio. refuse go Michigan. :) Plus, like take trips Markham Dimsum older age groups, believe lucky live countries started vaccinating, loads countries won‚Äôt even made significant dent elderly population time UK vaccinating 30s. Texas barely tests anyone, would even know many cases have? booked next several months last time tried calling around area.  term seasonality stretched beyond practical meaning. I‚Äôm sure someone replied flu R0 drops 1 summer months rises slightly winter months. important. seasonality. impact goes growth cases almost undetectable. means infection slightly tougher

Yes, appropriately, insignificantly tougher. 4th wave believe worst. starting really high baseline B.1.17 infectious severe age groups, don‚Äôt think saying worst behind us. mention it‚Äôs circulating children far far we‚Äôve seen since beginning. improves immunity, comment people acting like week difference makes big deal. joke. 

69 = name sex position.

420 = Code relating marajuana. would cataclysmic UK since majority younger population still receive first dose. problem AstraZeneca. US shit show COVID, sure shit good idea. people keep faking crappy paper cards, it‚Äôs good idea.

Your acting like permanent, it‚Äôs not. kinda deflates worked about.

Canada reopen it‚Äôs time, that. 

Zero visitors next couple years, lol, hear yourself? it. Since way implement vaccine passport Florida would recipient paper card scan passport app. ""trust"" standpoint would give absolutely nothing feel-good technical theater. much something ask now. Since 2019 think. fill first page see 'Personal Information' section form, look screenshot export rest AZ COVAX.

How better alternative? vaccine actually safety problem, better give third world countries?  see 37 cases 6 times greater? 37 cases 18 million vaccinated Europe. March 18th 5 reported cases 11 million. There‚Äôs reason even remotely concerned blood clotting vaccines. literally playing politics medicine. hyperbolic. human rights essentially indefinitely detained. reason considering safe outside healthy. sure, feel free support human rights abuses. second dose real doozie. I‚Äôm Gen X younger brother millennial. told vaccine appointment booked booked his. hesitant hurry get told him. hope helped change mind. bad holiday!  69.420% 

Nice. mean clearly reasons statistics back up. 5-10% increase efficacy could totally see company pushing second shot double income. still actually big pharma, all. nice number haha, like. fuck? immigrants this? think trying label order claim moral superiority.

Here's answer: no. Super Bowl superspreader, even less people vaccinated back then. Also, Florida completely open 5 months point, changed.

If Super Bowl happen front limited crowd, WrestleMania. choice it‚Äôs taking forever become eligible? news? didnt vaccine work. much people want bad UK, it‚Äôs really not. younger age group Novavax able swoop save day here, young people aren‚Äôt even getting vaccinated Novavax going come online (hopefully). export rest AZ COVAX. right.

We decades, ever away effective vaccine! Wait, 5? coming?

Everyone immunized year? 

Sorry bud, things going get back normal. us listened science. mean based anecdotal musings sister, nurse, something like 80% patients ward either directly indirectly due obesity drugs.

So 80% beds doctor's time taken people consciously unhealthy due actions, think argument made pose risk getting prompt good healthcare service hospital. somebody show CDC says immunocompromised people can't get vaccine? see take serious reaction one vaccine ingredients. three vaccines available likely small group. (Note current rate anaphylaxis 5 per million). 

I keep hearing argument people medical conditions can't take vaccine yet see list CDC conditions (other allergic reaction) people vaccinated. know right? imagine people might qualified alive today

then girl saying building cafeteria say works kitchen ‚Äútechnically ‚Äú building/ company essentially ‚Äúcut line‚Äù exactly turn yet

‚Äú im relieved stretched truth position get vaccinated ‚Äú

meanwhile 550k lives lost often temporary programs give certain people power discriminate get shutdown spontaneously?

Even intent malicious, could create world certain venues leave passports place wealthier customer base prefers environment without riff-raff (low-education people/minorities). see benefits, implement something like it'll stay. That's saying even people disease still get vaccinated. Rent free verified proof vaccination, don‚Äôt, continue quarantine. That‚Äôs ‚Äúabuse‚Äù, it‚Äôs good policy. Let's hope so. I've got hankerin' Tim Hortons. There's really thing ""required,"" though. example, someone know get second shot health concerns. first shot nothing... though gold standard. kinda one kept going bud. 

You zero experience health care system clear. Fucking finally don‚Äôt think every snowbird wealthy. commented elsewhere folks live community mobile homes Palm Springs winter lot Canadians come months. rich people. Cases certainly spiking areas NY experience massive Spring 2020 wave. Take look Mid-Hudson Valley, Albany, Western NY areas. It‚Äôs realistic number we‚Äôll hit many people refusing vaccine. 80.08135% would fantastic it‚Äôs reach... Late party, y'all work rest us. Thank you! MSM loves pour misery. make sunny day dangerous worrisome.  Did....did complain listening experts?

Ignorance bliss guess. Uh extremely multi-faceted reasons open lockdown proponents boil chasing impossible dream zero Covid matter cost. Mental health one facet. Ah, sorry rizebof cases across US totally unrelated that.

Is immigrant's fault numbers going despite massive vaccination push Biden? Gonna real hard win elections significant portion voters ground COVID. arguing you. Canada right implement whatever ludicrous hoops want implement. ready accept policy kept place, zero foreign visitation Canada next 1-2 years.

Just country RIGHT implement law rule, mean good idea. hand foot now! Yeah think lot people hear accounts young people saying asymptomatic pretty much nothing, start believing cold, even less dangerous flu, young people. one wants pay attention examples so-called mild cases actually really nasty, they'd rather believe evidence points optimistic result. first dose mild sore arm, got full display side effects second. Never covid, dull headache, body aches, pretty substantial fatigue whole day second dose last week. said, Tylenol cleared right late night fine next day, all, bad 200% worthwhile. article says could 30's add age numbers wrong switch demographics trend view age lines flat since 3rd, data definitely propagating correctly. Got first dose today! Feels awesome, man. Canada shut US, almost year. it‚Äôs mind, it‚Äôs Health Canada, perfect, done decent job.

Just look COVID numbers compared US.

It likely open general population allowed shots. Likely July. companies happen referred similar names. Sinovac's Chinese name ""Sino"" (China) rather Beijing based Beijing; company's English name is, however, Sinovac Biotech, stock ticker SVA based name. Sinopharm SOE name China National Pharmaceutical Group Corporation, likely shortened colloquial use China Pharmaceutical - Sinopharm. Sinovac's vaccine actually called CoronaVac, easier everyone refer vaccines company produces distributes them. absolutely within Canada's rights mistreat vaccinated citizens. However, must realize stance essentially KILL hope travelers abroad least year? Come on, let's hyperbolic. sunlight; see windows picture.

Not suck suck hard. What‚Äôs significance 69.420%? No, that's says it, getting 1 shot first worked well countries. Well fuck, tinnitus idea. got J&amp;J today, would've asked thigh guess one group, probably would've guessed them. Private businesses setting rules? Good. rules beliefs? Nevermind, bad!

Yes, would okay allow people yet eligible vaccinated, choice. 
It's small business temporary rule, like they're permanently barring certain race class people establishment. Seasonality compliance restrictions. I‚Äôve heard places Texas enforcing restrictions kept place state loosened up. California demonstrated strict restrictions paper don‚Äôt matter big spike people realized little enforcement started ignoring them. Texas benefiting people voluntarily complying public health guidelines, vaccination, level immunity among careless. FaUCi sAYs!  let panic you. Fauci really saying this:

We trial way. know works. know use one dose vaccines two doses trial.


J&amp;J trialed one dose. done one dose. Pfizer Moderna trialed two dose, there's limited data one dose efficacy. Fauci uneasy taking limited data, making inferences, one dose two dose vaccines.

Except anorexics! Enjoy making Jeff Bezos look like poor man LOL state it‚Äôs open everyone that‚Äôs adult Indiana daily average cases risen 750 1000. Ohio's went 1500 1800. Illinois' went 1500 2700. Indiana results similar neighbors, reasonable conclude similar factors behind conclude Indiana's rise caused something present Ohio Illinois. Lmao imagine thinking Florida ever pandemic bubble Honestly whole pandemic way reported really makes dislike media more, flip flopping masks ""12 days flatten curve"" turning ""No normal cure"" 

People want admit it, mainstream media played role creating Covidiots, solely Trump (although played biggest role).

 can't scold, publicly shame, browbeat people living sequestered life (especially many people know making big vacation plans 2020) expect comply questions asked. need promise lived back covid said done. media failed miserably part. referring thread. Stop cherry picking evidence already agrees viewpoint. literally takes 5 seconds research yourself. Learn independent.

other wide-eyed clickbait stories fake cards ""available"" dark web, I've seen zero evidence widespread fraud. She‚Äôs less likely contagious infected. absolutes. Man makes feel good, Covid Christmas got first jab last week. 

I'm still obviously going get second couple weeks, great hear. doesn‚Äôt take lot impress European, apparently. üòú get vaccinated already proven body capable producing antibodies? vaccine free everyone, see would issue. business tailors types customers already things keep riff-faff... ‚ÄúJust use willpower‚Äù great public health strategy definitely solve problem

This like health version ‚Äúwhy don‚Äôt work hard get poverty‚Äù declines also happened period UK form ""lock down"" restrictions. US many states allowing people go bars restaurants travel period comparison. apples apples implying direct comparison made accurate. minorities 65% distrust rates historical government fucking around? bizarre U.K. variant gets press fear mongering coverage U.S. seems U.K. itself. 

The UK went extremely severe lockdown response new strain, British health leaders calling darkest day pandemic. Nearly 4 months lockdown that's really ending vaccination program, came time cases going nearly fast enough continued doomsday reporting U.S. seems disproven U.K. Israel

The reason creating much noise US US gotten grip it. like first wave, much worse, US vaccinations getting speed is, again, saving grace. Without vaccines, UK, US Israel would screwed. England vaccine coverage far people taken follows

80 plus: 95.2%

75-79: 100%

70-74: 96.8%

Just incase people think stock everything. uptake really region Yes, eventually - things become complicated rush things. Think way...


Hypothetically, knew sure keeping kids school one month, maybe two, could guarantee thousands lives saved, would pandemic FASTER less virus population, would think good idea? Obviously want delay max efficiency high risk populations.. Well could methods prove status simply ""card"" Actually, know poster disagreeing then. warned problems old normal, suspect really arguing going back better normal. That's want. also wonder allergies relate too. I'm Chicago, I've really bad allergies(i think) last 3 weeks. Coughing bunch due nasal drip, etc. 

I know much people affected differently across country due seasonal allergies local flora, think spring allergies could definitely boost transmission rates Covid. Buffalo Wild Wings shadow glory chain mid-90s. came India Sweden January. used think Indians taking virus seriously, lack seriousness towards pandemic Sweden another level. it? 
So happening? Got it. really need advice google cannot give clear answer situation. scheduled get Moderna vaccine Wednesday going see girlfriend tomorrow Tuesday day before. 

The problem found coworker best friend, worked recently, sick work likely exposed Covid. 

Now I‚Äôm worried covid couple months back, question exposed still contagious Covid before? safe see her? Especially appointment vaccine next day. Eh, I've seen, Americans Brits pretty honest countries handled pandemic abysmally excelled vaccine rollout. populations delaying second dose less ideal. According 2020 World Migration Report:

- top destination country international migrants 

- top remittance-sending country 

- 2nd refugee resettlements, Canada #1 (US led metric previous studies done 2005, 2010, 2015)

- largest foreign born population 

- largest recipient asylum claims 

I'm Canadian US silly place definitely leads world bad things friend able pressure another friend getting it. waffling sounded skeptical drug even though damn trials, got vaccine didn‚Äôt grow horns. 

Our approach less ‚Äúget get god damn drink indoors eat indoors weather isn‚Äôt patio friendly.‚Äù Knowing quite likes misses form hanging out, didn‚Äôt take long relent lmao

I don‚Äôt get people wusses it. Millions gotten vaccine point nobody‚Äôs dying it. You‚Äôd think afraid shadows. ignoring cells. turns out, none variants changes would impact ability cells kill infected cell.""

I've waiting months somebody call media bullshit; antibody aspect entire thing. There's reason real world data showing vaccines protecting people famous variants, total immune response still favourable providing high degree protection. ...what, u dont think pharma gets paid lol? mean come on... industry can't sue damages... make difference, last summer cases stagnant summer US. go summer way population immunity, cases fall vulnerable protected. 

Honestly hard know even find common ground think 4th wave worst seems like completely ignoring existence Vaccines. Hopefully lot ovens make pizzas NJ finally moved date everyone eligible vaccine 4/19. Hooray! #notlast mean country earned money war profiteering countries? various lockdowns *and* ample school testing/isolating done vaccinations ramp up. see overall cases might still dropping. What‚Äôs point? That‚Äôs weird. It‚Äôs pretty proven it‚Äôs efficient older groups real life results UK trial USA. 

Hopefully EMA MHRA come clear advise ensures safety trust vaccine product. 75% 65+, millions daily....eventually need move life 80% first dose? NY CA hit extremely hard early too? 

NY, CA. time CA seemed like great success beat virus. hit CA. 

This story virus. Politicians, health officials, reporters etc., would attribute success failure state country measures took. later found success failure probably little measures took. UK Israel ran observational studies vaccine efficacy. UK found 72% efficacy three weeks; Israel found 66%. would characterize second-dose improvement marginal.  said would happen many many months back.

This ""British"" variant, first exploded onto scene lockdown relaxed reopen British schools. 

This created perfect selective pressure virus, workplaces, pubs, restaurants, gyms, etc, etc remained shut, ""denying"" virus adult adult transmission creating new route spreading children.

The UK country this, course, going happen somewhere schools reopened rest population stayed locked down. always peculiarity original virus spread well amongst children, matter time adapted created fertile conditions it.

Doubt it. addition what‚Äôs said, want people come back second shot. tell people they‚Äôre ‚Äúprotected‚Äù first shot, come back second one? Got second yesterday, feel like train hit well worth it! Yeah mean started whole thread intention saying producing vaccine people's arms failing. terms production, they've failed. Sure. I'm totally fussed that. still one biggest vaccines world Pfizer many vaccines compete AZ. 

But I'm AZ fan. think generally negative vaccines profit responsible 2022 vaccinating world. Whereas Pfizer responsible vaccinating first world. (Also great, amazing. talk terms winning losing here. vaccines amazing) exact stadium Super Bowl, held front amount fans (roughly 25K).

The Super Bowl superspreader event, number vaccinated people exponentially less today. It'll fine. Exactly. Antibodies say nothing immunity, rather sickness. ability reproduce antibodies case Infection immunity is. www.reddit.com Right, prove health status live normal life means ""anti-vax"".

Again thankful outside weirdos sub, one would tolerate this. state Florida, I've seen anything related, like unemployment website. assured every one Texas doomed. brazil never really lock experiencing worse moment 4 thousands dead per day? knowledge, country still giving AstraZeneca *younger* people Spain.

It makes absolutely sense... could understand giving everyone assess risk clots low enough, one high enough, older people given seem clots much risk COVID.

As Spaniard hope EMA brings sanity either way country's position outright absurd.  currently aren't, point. Lots places kids school, without entirety rest population vaccinated difference is, using AZ data longer dosing. think Pfizer/Moderna trials longer time doses it? sure whose downvoting hilarious. Maybe sub lost sense humor back?! Even true change excess death numbers. vaccinated yet though. Romania part EU. Moldova isn't.

Romania larger richer part USSR (even though part Easter Block). Moldova was.

We trying help Moldovan brothers much can. Hunker you‚Äôve last 12 months lol. hard. seems like media wants thing is.

Lol Conservatives said Covid, racism, gun violence. Basically everything covered Conservative media. I'm glad could stand people want argue with. UK regulator literally talking restricting use large parts population, many jurisdictions. Calling moot point simply representative current situation. I'm sure go ask help this. hospital work telling staff come work even test positive ""because vaccine quarantine test positive."" also said positive test result (this week) vaccine (which got January). 

I've reported state health department, joint commission, corporate compliance, OSHA apparently reports made hospital multiple times throughout pandemic. is, far know, first time they're flat telling us come even test positive. else do? post ask help this? You‚Äôd thing private schools stayed open would data going CDC's vaccine tracker percentage adults? prediction: MLB series postponed already go rather smoothly since lot players said want take vaccine, NFL first sport whole season covid interruptions mostly full fans since August thats plenty time Yeah, honestly think it‚Äôll ok end. Best case, turns vaccine safe dose 2. Worst case, different one (would like chat doctor could cause complications tbh).

I‚Äôm fan uncertainty, guess least single dose protection now. trust MHRA make decent call  white people look you? What's next, gonna mistake Ryan Reynolds Ben Affleck? remember people said cases fine long hospilizations remain low. it‚Äôs deaths... even though lag. Goalposts keep moving here. due public health community calling one shot +delayed second shot regiment stop current wave wait. exposure day first dose got lucky still regret it. hunker two weeks. Ok pointed data. It‚Äôs moot point, good vaccines nonsense comments shutting one stupid According recent (march 12, month old already) news also miss second quarter deliveries EU 50%. 
At least time told us advance going fail. 
 
Meanwhile, Pfizer BioNTech way produce significantly vaccines originally planned. Actually CA hit hard last spring. sent medical ships NYC LA LA end needing it. time wondered locked early enough avoid worst. start see spike June even took winter see NY level surge. guess virus following pattern hitting northeast like last year. That's I'm worried surge CA coming moment. remember looking case numbers last March seeing michigan top five states wondering well. ok?  states countries flirting ideas giving everyone 1 dose first full series. got second dose yesterday around noon. Neither us issues first shot, 2nd one got immediate pain arm 12 hours later started getting aches, pains, chills, fever nausea. bed since. 

I get 2nd shot Wednesday despite watching go side effects, still excited ever Vax relax. customer base prefers environment without riff-raff (low-education people/minorities)

Please explain communities underserved least states bringing vaccine doorstep populations. don‚Äôt think so. adults get vaccinated shouldn‚Äôt matter kids get covid 99.9% children won‚Äôt die virus even get severely ill. trying keep deaths stop people catching it. know peeps sex questionable strangers festival portapotties refusing get vaccinated... like... dawg, know genitals been????? there's lot competition today.

These things enjoyable draining introverts, that's less key difference extroverts introverts. Broadly speaking, extroverts find social activities recharging restorative, introverts find draining, types people find enjoyable. 

By way analogy, like ice cream, society decided ""normal"" thing eat big bowl ice cream every day like even though like ice cream. prefer eat ice cream week even less often that. someone like bowl ice cream every day, power them, enjoy ice cream, quite good, that's much ice cream me. enjoy things, can't imagine would unhappy seeing people things.

I'm unhappy seeing people things, fact core thrust saying work towards society people pursue things make happy. 

This last bit possibly read watch Netflix day normal times fine, understand pandemic makes easier it. pandemic removed option to.

There social pressure placed introverts engage social activities even may feel drained, even find enjoyable. understand pandemic makes easier it.

And herein lies potential misunderstanding, pandemic made easier simultaneously removed social stigma around wanting go even made activity introvert might prefer (staying in) virtuous, introverts relished taking advantage of.

Overall, hate people, hate social activities, I'm hermit, enjoy taking dogs walks, going hikes, even getting together friends. also hate extroverts want see miserable, **I want everyone happy.**

And think anyone actually wrong, extroverted friends invite go things diabolical plan sap energy, want fun see need recharge. societal expectations pressure disappoint friends, decline invitations, worst cases seen someone like fun want stay recharge lifted made life bit easier.

I work healthcare it‚Äôs extra hard. People still avoiding us. always small percentage convinced anyone anything, peer pressure definitely close gap. Hear out, going easier heard immunities kids involved. 

While hard mandate vaccines adults, children easy soon drug approved via normal FDA approval method. primary schools /colleges mandate vaccines already. types care themselves. tf everyone bring fact knew literally almost nothing virus CDC Fauci advised PPE reserved healthcare front-line personnel data indicated general public needed use it? 


Obviously N95 mask would better us wearing, CDC advise general use reason: healthcare workers absolutely need general public sees marginal benefit. healthcare system adequate PPE would much higher impact non healthcare personnel used cloth masks. 


The CDC advising individual people, rather greatest benefit country overall, looking bigger picture perspective. No, want benefits fully open society without responsibility. Fuck people. Please red paper linked use it. 

The paper says number cases less non vaccinated population. ""Thus, incidence immune‚Äêmediated thrombocytopenia post SARS‚ÄêCoV‚Äê2 vaccination appears either less roughly comparable would seen cases coincidental following vaccination, perhaps enhanced somewhat heightened surveillance symptomatic patients.

They speculate possible causes data support correlation adn even say it.

With AZ number cases much greater (like 6x) non vaccinated population especially Germany, Denmark Norway. dude doesn‚Äôt seem concerned. points vaccines also train t-cell response rarely gets talked about.

Hiding forever something .001% chance happening someone age, happen. extroverts Reddit, everyone knows that! busy outside extrovert things! might get reserved second shot. least discussion Netherlands. send people back home states Well yes, support them. clearly handled correctly. different situation. There's still high levels virus opening completely least without measures place still lot unvaccinated people runs risk something like Chile happening. opened quickly hospital started filling young middle-aged people point 95% ICU capacity go lockdown again. Thank you. Looks like article updated April 1st. recall 50% minimum US FDA said would accept. Brazil downgraded efficacy Chinese coronavirus vaccine hailed major triumph last week, diminishing hopes shot could quickly produced easily distributed help developing Butantan Institute S√£o Paulo said Tuesday trial conducted Brazil showed CoronaVac vaccine, made Beijing-based company Sinovac, efficacy rate 50 percent. rate, slightly benchmark World Health Organization said would make vaccine effective general use, far 78 percent level announced last week. us got Johnson &amp; Johnson shot? Judging website alone, every one them. all. already paper cards getting sold online. official document would harder falsify 8 cases single K class one week school narrative still school spread happening. Sorry, ~~staring at~~ talking female aid. question again? course not. want government willing take responsibility outbreaks start new rules, do. People keep saying it‚Äôs true Dallas. I‚Äôve going bars past two weekends basically one wearing masks every place packed. Even Walmart mask usage unenforced compliance barely 50%. People returning normal cases haven‚Äôt gone matter excuses people try make. we're clear here: care much whether effective right thing much care punishing traveled? idiotic. Data also design/build them

So what's expertise, exactly?  No, masks condoms vaccines like birth control. Well help. I'll ask asking you: mechanism would use? told one would use.

Now told neither. mechanism believe would encourage people get vaccinated? house fire firehydrant nearby hose, someone finds hose hardware store seems like would work, common sense says would work, there's even fire chief hose engineer nearby look hose hook test say works, state regulatory body requires 3-years hose testing new hoses used, still want use hose? 

Just follow standard regulated procedure mean untested, mean unsafe. means got special exception due circumstances. exception requirements met. like needed hose ASAP wait three years put fire. still needed fire chief sign-off it, still needed hose engineer inspect it, still needed testing it. 

It's like IRB exemptions. Getting IRB exemption mean failed IRB. means review board chair reviewed application felt need full review. still form passing, even language used say ""passed.""

The SARS-COV-2 vaccines still reviewed tested passed testing. different way normal. I'm routinely checking planned deliveries numbers much higher weeks ago, I'm also much optimistic. Germans fucking stupid. believe pace won‚Äôt change all. ramp all. vaccine amount people everyday. lol

We've told pace accelerate next week next month 3 months . way we've told last three weeks lockdown. far nothing happened believe ? all. stronger immune response others. UK 3 month lockdown. I‚Äôd say taking pretty seriously! taking serious US. Florida cases variant US look happened Spring Break Miami. Maybe dire warnings news stories won‚Äôt lockdown ill equipped leaders politicized early on. 10x less lethal fact. agree insane. People can't let go. guess nobody wants public figure arguing something people believe may safe.

But anecdotally, friends family vaccinated, including many cautious sequestered houses year, immediately got back normal lives 2-4 weeks vaccines. 80-something in-laws, town friends, etc. went right back travel, friends, family, hugs, dinners, everything else. think reckless dangerous, believe fully vaccinated thus safe.

When people charge colleges public spaces finally come senses anyone's guess. think others could least make good faith argument 'best efforts' delivering amounts promised. 
 
It's entirely possible AZ made best efforts bad luck made fail massively delivering. so, combined terrible communication transparency.  I‚Äôm 4 days post-shot it‚Äôs like everyone around trying make get covid; everyday hear ‚Äúyou‚Äôre vaccinated‚Äù, ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt get vaccine?‚Äù. tell takes 14 days post shot kick roll eyes, it‚Äôs becoming annoying lmao ... directly addressed saying. skip **""That much vaccination coupled natural immunity people who've enough prevent ICU overflows.""** disagreeing 70% adults vaccinated, coupled high levels natural immunity, enough prevent overwhelming healthcare system? vaccine *truly* open everyone, we'll probably see this. Even states qualifications lax unofficially open everyone, appointments filling quick. enthusiastic people gotten shots, need get point literally walk pharmacy whim get vaccinated hour. think biggest potential hurdle anti-vaxxers, people want go whole rigmarole finding specific eligibility group they're in, refreshing multiple websites find open spots, scheduling appointment weeks out, etc. need advertising push coincide massive boost convenience isn‚Äôt surprising. 

The virus spreading always spread private gatherings. border doesn‚Äôt mean much, mean lot friendships. lot friendships made school neighborhood, places border means something. believe vaccines effective. also believe following quarantine rules set place. way verify travelers vaccinated paper easily forged database sharing I‚Äôm aware US Canada. Sorry vaccine passports aren‚Äôt place yet guess.

Canada might database check vaccination status. idea. Sinopharm

That‚Äôs excellent question. 

Chile contracts AstraZeneca-Oxford, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Pfizer-BioNTech, Sinovac, iirc. Chile started using BioNTech vaccine early December, also led major J&amp;J trials although approval widespread use slower, AZ Sinopharm approved January ... I‚Äôve unable find source breaks many vaccines used. google-fu must weak today. No, look Israel. cases plummeting see ignoring fact england pretty heavy lockdowns months, talking opening things up. (2nd shot moderna) first time ‚Äò sick‚Äô good me. didn‚Äôt get sick 2 phase vaccines. learned getting sick helps prepare real deal happens. feels like flu without runny nose cough.

Awesome. take look this. Thank you. 

I guess follow question would trying understand science antibody count someone Covid vaccine. know someone enough antibodies? good count? someone already antibodies, would vaccine help? antibodies better? vaccine already, know antibody count going get booster? Acting like variants doom us stupid, acting like variants inconsequential assessments ebb flow Covid stupid well. true vaccines, good enough. I'm ""anti-lockdown"" degree, especially ineffective ones like implemented UK, I'm highly supportive measures far less intrusive long term. Places like South Korea, post-lockdown Singapore Wuhan, Iceland Taiwan places policies support they're efficient interim raising vaccination levels. needs properly assessed rushed saying effect can't trust citizens forge paperwork?

 extension I'd assume indefinite border lockdown quarantine requirement?

Doesn't imposing $2000 mandatory quarantine people (after already left previous rules) provide incentive people would need WANT forge paperwork? mask use, social distancing permanent. Anti-vaxxers, children, immunocompromised, escape variants means fully vaccinated society never reached. dwi know multiple people lost jobs, homes, relationships hope future leaving education careers go live parents possibilities currently. Pretty sensational. 4 week spacing fine. 18-24 day spacing thing hard-set number zero reason waiting another week would change efficacy. No, it‚Äôs not. harm testing often! Get tested, there's plenty capacity people getting vaccinated. Look outcomes kids, it‚Äôs less lethal flu Yeah people kill whole idea. Sure won‚Äôt wear mask crowded places will. personally won‚Äôt wear one family friends public. Hopefully though it‚Äôs matter time say don‚Äôt wear one ok, clinical trials rolling 300 million people takes significantly longer 48 hours though. CA seems bucking trend. We've strong public health measures restrictions, yet we're rate 2.7k new cases (7 day average), lowest since May 2020 hasn‚Äôt hot state all. It‚Äôs mostly 70s highs Dallas cold front coming last week kept highs 60s. week first time year sustained temps 80. gonna lie, lost Dr Osterholm. SNL ran skit weekend host game show tried talk 4 relatives getting shot, using various arguments logic, also offering cash, starting $500 think going $20,000 like, well thank you.

It really logic reasoning facts, people get freaked whatever reason, make logical sense hard argue with. question info Red Cross gave conflicts above: ‚ÄúThe American Red Cross testing blood, platelet plasma donations COVID-19 antibodies. Results may indicate donor‚Äôs potential past exposure coronavirus ‚Äì regardless whether experienced symptoms. Testing may also identify presence antibodies developed receiving COVID-19 vaccine.‚Äù

(Source: donating blood next week, 3 weeks COVID vaccine, curious show not! restrictions still lifted March 8th Sorry mate. gotta wait another scandal that's allowed. believe vaccines effective then? gotten heavy piece easily forged paper Canada, would make feel better? Idk live Toronto strict. Ableist slur? even about? one saying people Myanmar deserve die? rather elderly means get vaccinated ASAP US wait Canada greater risk death serious illness? 

Seriously issue mostly elderly snowbirds got vaccinated abroad? theory reduce stress meager Canadian vaccine supply no?  start taking off. Happy cake day ! doubt guy gets invited house parties. actually need ""declared officially fully vaccinated"" safely go outside. Dr. Osterholm couple interviews last couple days reiterating felt gone initial single-shot approach get many people vaccinated possible. He's pretty pessimistic regarding spikes Michigan Minnesota seeing especially relates B.1.1.7 variant. think Fauci defending current approach saying single shot provides certain efficacy old strains, can't assume that's true variants. Perhaps additional information making favor existing approach. comfort, seriously smallest needle ever... Less painful flu shot like blaming black politicians failure reconstruction slavery America.


No, actually like all. never state majority black government. Palestinian authority government. Israel deserves lot blame setting PA failure. PA also done consistently piss poor job running sovereign territory. possible hold Israel Palestine responsible current situation. pretty bad look subreddit guys. Better delete move on. lmao course. impossible eat/drink mask, owner made bar 100% masks. more.

Still, owner clearly required follow local laws control. would great local laws updated new CDC recommendations vaccine verification becomes thing.  Plenty countries desperate vaccines. like they're throwing away. tend way choice

Right, historically, [it‚Äôs sorta comparable phenomenon white flight always, course, often. volunteering vaccination site, paper important keep order get second dose tell got vaccinated important keep, thr paper like little card could hide somewhere Amount unvaccinated people key though. It‚Äôs like we‚Äôre seeing people inculcated hospitalized seller's market created persona hate, look data I've posted. Whatever makes life easier. hardly ever see young children either wearing mask correctly entire public encounter idea long takes Walgreens Walmart update eligibility? Technically state opening everyone today still show old rules many no. know multiple people living unemployment playing warzone video games non stop. envy go work everyday magic milkbone trumpet located? CA probably easiest place get vaccine. maybe society get backs, wait supply longer issue, re-evaluate months. Coercion usually backfires. Okay, so... Stop ordering vaccine doses know can't pay for... kidding? movements comprised 19 year old married moms Facebook live parents use WIC get angry immigrants drain system repost conservative memes it. assumption silly reeks plain anti-israeli sentiment. Ship *to* EU? think doses made?

Hint: US. Weird. hospital US midwest vaccinating anyone comes in. charge. even get cookies bottle water snack wait.

Netanyahuuuu crackhead. segment said fee $40 per shot.  adds real money, mention additional revenue added foot traffic. They're waiting USAs subsidies Agreed. intentionally get vaccine, alone suffer consequences (and mean specifically OP, I'm saying general sense). 

And since looks like vaccine passports going thing, also suffer consequences able travel, allowed certain group settings like concerts festivals, may also face barred employment education. feel bad people, getting vaccinated quick simple way protect everyone around you. passed budget? much gentle way

I think might misperception. tens millions white Christian evangelicals (up 100 million) single race ethnicity, except whites ([250 It‚Äôs *huge* portion population. 

The US population ~330 million. khan academy! arent anarchist? Almost liked people spent hundreds/thousands years rigging game gains make grounds seem short lived. Israel wouldn‚Äôt getting extras turn around sell countries need, would they? read local paper part due b117 variant contagious. article says seeing younger people hospitalized. suppose getting down. thought getting dangerous. Black people medical experiments performed without consent since first came country. Even pain taken less seriously likely die childbirth. Articles written gently toward rationale hesitancy vastly different white Evangelicals. Isn‚Äôt literally Israel refusing do? Pandemic definitely brought authoritarian streak people. fascinating seeing quickly people leaned ""there two classes people"".  know nothing effectiveness rates though, want protection covid. people may wish remain exposed, thinking catch it, do. want protected, many others. Could worse. Could Canada, budget since 2019, vaccines scale Israel. Well tell drive past restaurants, literally every single parking spot taken. seems like conditions Saw comment B117 article today talking logistics spread.

Here's thing remember: 75% infectious mean ""if COVID 1% infectious, B117 75% infectious."" means 75% infection level covid taken added currently. (using made statistics) COVID 5% infectious B117 8.5% infectious. hypothesis' sake COVID merely 1% infectious would make B117 2% infectious.

Common sense? Maybe. Important note dissecting headlines? Very. I‚Äôm apart Gen Z I‚Äôm getting mine sooner later.  Pretty sure ACA prevents health insurance companies that. even freak recombination happened, groups like Moderna would start prototyping vaccine soon virus isolated. lol yeah I'm sure Israel would get right sister nurse general practioner‚Äôs office Chicago suburbs.

One coworkers got infected passed virus mother ended ICU. coworker finally gave got vaccinated...but wanted protect family virus. got vaccine heard would condition visit Mexico. sister disappointed hadn‚Äôt ‚Äúseen light‚Äù told whatever reason, matters she‚Äôs getting vaccinated.

Yeah, easy access middle class white neighborhoods.....that‚Äôs pretty much ‚Äúeverywhere‚Äù. 

No one even offered exclusive access, inherently denies easy vaccine access poor people. CVS Walgreens get vaccine first go care homes? Family socal bay area. issues getting vaccinated, especially older family members mobile tech savvy. tons issues distribution California...maybe pay attention news Except it‚Äôs free Americans Nah, he‚Äôs saying T-cell response vaccines really robust immunity antibodies, obviously specific particular epitope (that variants, change) 

Also... Dr. Racaniello literally wrote principles virology (the book many institutions use literally teach virology). teaches virology Columbia editor various academic virology journals. constructed infectious clone (while sequencing polio virus) basically changed study virology. never hearing probably there‚Äôs reason would needed to... sometimes people jobs well, you‚Äôll never hear them.

 Fauci incredible doctor vast amount experience etc., he‚Äôs also MD. capacity two people study infectious disease different, they‚Äôre going different opinions based relative perspectives. well. hes canada... slippery slope. arent allowes discriminate anymore charge based preexisting conditions, people already hard enough time accessing health care coverage clauses preventing care.

Full text: Navajo Nation, one worst coronavirus case United States, recently reached extraordinary milestone: [zero zero deaths 24-hour period.

The nation, 300,000 enrolled members, averaging 11 new cases day, far peak 250 late November, according [the latest Navajo Department Health.

And vaccinated population state, half 170,000 residents living tribal lands fully vaccinated.

But alarming signs. [infections rising dangerous circulating, U.S. health officials warning another surge. first confirmed case contagious possibly lethal [variant first found confirmed Navajo territory, stretches across Arizona, New Mexico Utah.

The Navajo, second-largest U.S. tribe, aren‚Äôt alone struggle virus. Indigenous Americans Covid-19 death nearly twice white populations United States, amid high rates comorbidities like diabetes obesity, according Centers Disease Control Prevention.

Jonathan Nez, president Navajo Nation, said tribe able tame virus members followed strict lockdown orders mask imposed nearly year ago.

‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt restricting people‚Äôs freedoms told people wear mask stay home. looking greater good,‚Äù Mr. Nez said CBS program ‚ÄúFace Nation‚Äù Sunday.

Vaccination efforts also big success, Mr. Nez said, [218,190 administered (nearly 90 percent doses allocated) 88,513 people fully vaccinated.

‚ÄúI think hard hit Navajo Nation was, we‚Äôve seen big increase participation taking vaccine,‚Äù Mr. Nez said, adding officials holding town hall meetings build trust answer questions virus.

Tribal health officials also credited nation‚Äôs decision coordinate closely federal Indian Health Service, oversees care 500 tribes throughout country, [Navajo health much streamlined operation patchwork approach across country.

Other tribes also successful pandemic responses. Reported cases Cherokee Nation, largest U.S. tribe, [dropped mid-March, Oklahoma stopped reporting daily virus data. tribe also quickly administered [thousands vaccine facing problem getting hesitant people vaccinated.

In pandemic‚Äôs early days, Navajo Nation [struggled contain Mr. Nez attributed difficulties resource inequities, underfunded health care system limited federal help.

The Indian Health Service ‚Äúhas underfunded since inception,‚Äù said. New York Times investigation last year found agency struggled respond pandemic long [plagued funding, supplies health care workers.

A recent [NPR however, found tribes decided receive vaccines Indian Health Service ‚Äî including White Mountain Apache Arizona Rosebud Sioux South Dakota ‚Äî far ahead went state systems.

[Tribal elders‚Äô devastated communities. lack local data complicated challenge controlling outbreaks.

President Biden‚Äôs $1.9 trillion [pandemic relief signed last month, provides $31 billion tribal nations Indigenous people address persistent problems like poor health care.

And Mr. Biden appointed former Representative Deb Haaland New Mexico secretary interior, making first Native American lead cabinet agency responsible well-being nation‚Äôs 1.9 million Native people.

‚ÄúWe finally seat table getting information advocacy addressed,‚Äù Mr. Nez said, referring collaboration White House acting director Indian Health Service. ‚ÄúWith funds coming citizens country terms recovery rescue, time around it‚Äôs finally helping nation grow.‚Äù Since beginning really. transition government failed pass budget vaccines paid for. even read article went straight comment? good, skipping phase 3 able say ""we race"" horrifying (and typical).

Russian scientists generally excellent, good anyone world. politics nightmarish. Dude, know you.

In fact, mean little blocked now. Sad true. Thanks really hope get in. weather location though seem like big downsides. yeah, draconian country that's almost entirely open social distancing months completely in-line covid numbers they've reported. People, large, read. watched, pass eyes block text, read. 

People suffer pain, perform drudgery, waste money, damage valued possessions reading.

(I used write specifications) likely nearly reached herd immunity due high total numbers infections + recent vaccinations. Downvoted you‚Äôre totally right. I'd disagree last point. certain level global danger risk virus becoming endemic, vaccination mandatory medically able take vaccine. tone black evangelicals putting vaccine rollout ending pandemic jeopardy... would okay that? would okay blame latinx population? think would encourage people get vaccine?? earth would think country world's draconian response measures trying hide virus? 

Because they're draconian country notorious lying everything lol.

I love questions answer them. Totally understand, American would trade last year heartbeat. many deaths per capita south border. last four years crazy! Trust me, living weird.

The difference Canada 4-6 weeks behind US vaccinations. That's it. Nobody remember year. They'll barely remember three months. bewilderment joy US come North couple weeks, almost guaranteed. looking south alternate reality, looking south slightly delayed positive future.

Also, Canada domestic vax manufacture. . . somehow managing swindle one higher vaccination rates world. know kind bribes gov't paid hookers embassies hired swing shit, that's pretty player move.

Here's open border--and soon. would terrified read sudden death illnesses cause well young, healthy people. It‚Äôs rabbit hole want go down. 

COVID terrible disease. death every young person tragic, isn‚Äôt makes terrible ‚Äî it‚Äôs don‚Äôt see news articles every time 17 year old died meningitis infection untreated strep throat. I‚Äôm trying spend less time sub realize I‚Äôve using venting space, similar sentiments live US.

I live NJ reason, can‚Äôt shake feeling dragged till Spring Summer 2022.  America track produce billion vaccines. 330 million people vaccinated third them. need 500 million vaccines, half people get Johnson &amp; Johnson. 

We're track produce 1 billion vaccines, least twice number need. help Euro friends soon. yes. significantly mortal diseases kids right? covid19 obviously not. vaccine vulnerable people around world instead vaccinating children developed countries would understand vaccine propaganda really commercial. I‚Äôm driving 2 hours way mine CA. Don‚Äôt brosef!!! cases point. I‚Äôm willing bet lot people cusp sides 30 aren‚Äôt caricature ‚Äúbig fat guy‚Äù you‚Äôre painting. 

Somebody 5‚Äô11 215 pounds fairly typical athletic build would qualify wouldn‚Äôt considered ‚Äúsuffering body.‚Äù None certain. likely enough people get current vaccines now, fast enough, covid longer threat.

A vaccine already gives ""natural immunity"", without making sick. I'll gladly waive right agree let live life without show papers get stores. Deal? bad piece paper, supposed something scans therefore used track you. I'm anything even theoretically used track me. hope correct purely fear mongering. I've seen sentiments shift pretty drastically last week feels like we're getting ready goalpost shift. matters Tennessee, already basically wide open, worry bit we'll start seeing rhetoric shift ""we must protect children!"" spending last year saying ""we must protect vulnerable!"" Absolutely. Hope learn adopt large-scale telework hybrids species' varied personality types. 

We evolve work 8-12 hour days crowded office. Introverts. Extroverts. Stability exploration. adapt institutions all. centuries millennia, people got solitary farmers hunters. advocating return that. 

But advocating broadening meaningful choice freedom. Hmm, it‚Äôs I‚Äôm email, guess mistaken. Try editing appointment see is. amazing. literally going check list. Again, quote Ah, variants.... people know, worrying vaccines going compromised variant. That‚Äôs say certainty. they‚Äôre older white women liberal.

Case point: Marin County, CA.  Well, technically they'd fine (at least while) - vaccines produce much stronger immune response still worth getting one.  see comment now, yes, correct. responded comment confirming this. qualms showing vaccination record do, going wear sort face covering. Nope. 

I also understand covid passport idea create lot inequity, especially elderly. crazy close center BMI ""normal"" 5'9, 140 lbs, yet get comments ""super skinny"" time. 

I could lose 15lbs still considered ""normal"".

The entire BMI scale thrown way outside perceived expectations ""normal"" US.

A BMI 30 would 200lbs 5'9 fat. way around it. another example everyone get vaccinated help people like mom. One thing may common sense greater infectiousness exponential effect potential spikes/surges. 

One person B117 infects \~75% people average. means time takes regular COVID double, B117 cases go \~3.3x. OG COVID cases increase 10x, B117 cases increase 56x. Reddit appears death overzealous bots claiming incivility low-effort. Calling DeSantis exactly is, without profanity insult, apparently offensive bot. all. People want know get back normal. herd immunity? adults want vaccine get one? kids access vaccine? vulnerable members society protected hospitalizations drop? daily cases hit X number? That's concern here. I'm 5 9 155 always need eat. I'm skinny fat I‚Äôm concerned different classes vaccinated people developing next months (May-October) full herd immunity achieved.

What J&amp;J shot reduces transmission 60% instead 92% like MRNA shots? going summer Moderna Pfizer people go life normally, J&amp;J people told keep masking limit interactions children non-vaccinated?

Maybe it‚Äôs dumb concern, IDK. it‚Äôs crossed mind. can't make system businesses know vaccinated #vaccinepassorts bad shit. terrible reactions AZ vaccine, makes wonder infected before. Experts say selfies encourage others overcome vaccine hesitancy, may also incite jealousy among eligible book appointments.

This bullshit, let people happy once. Getting tired useless virtue signaling., people access, pester government have, people happy alive. I've already accepted get vaccinated 2022 don‚Äôt want disappointed get July situation hasn‚Äôt improved all. It‚Äôs like lockdown; vaccine ‚Äúramp up‚Äù always going four weeks away actually happens. one see future one knows is. we‚Äôve seen AZ, contracts delivery promises don‚Äôt mean shit vaccines actually arrive. September still five months away; lot one million side effects either Pfizer/Moderna/J&amp;J banned time frame. I've never heard term ""casual link"", definitely causal link, confused. think return normal? normal, mean able go without wearing mask limited social distancing.

I hear we‚Äôll end stage pandemic half population vaccinated. think statement? Given covid testing USA free unlimited - different? UK access free unlimited testing now? confirm, J&amp;J side effects rough covid.  course Trump it, choose ignore that. I'm actually worried CDC going approve vaccine kids April make priority right things open phase 2, meaning never get fucking vaccine unless decide lie like literally half people know doing. Newer guidelines point towards 7 days symptoms negative test means clear mom teaches 3&amp;4yo kids person. 100% proper mask compliance. even warn ahead time need change masks it‚Äôs becoming untied. teaches downstate NY.  It‚Äôs attitude parents. shoes, test negative, I‚Äôd carry on! well masked close. It‚Äôs wonderful thoughtful concerned other‚Äôs health! \*space man meme\*

always been... us favor Mr. Expert new green logo. 

Read Autopsy report Geroge Floyd show died choked out..PLEASE! 

Cause appears though died sickle cell covid..according medical examiner. Epsitein issue; city medical examiner said killed himself, expert came showed false too...

Additionally cool title add anything opinion. might know microbiology conversation regard psychology amounts suicides actually going last year vs labeled something else make report appear better....Happens stats time. Might talk Engineer buds it. Remember Reddit proclaimed future collapse TX reopening ending mask mandates?

I guess really meant Michigan. You‚Äôre absolutely right thing. weeks you‚Äôve infinitely better risking mama‚Äôs life. bet would agree 100%. definitely think choosing lesser 2 evils right kid. US: ‚ÄúFirst time?‚Äù mention BMI 30 muscle, vaccine really targeted Yeah, free Krispy Kreme Donuts mine get messed pretty fast. Definitely need protect somehow. Yeah suppose low risk personally, makes sense rush demand general still much greater supply. Population density matter.  Makes sense. 

Just famous people, still GenPop, get vaccine it‚Äôs good. 

Glad see teams together highly doubt restrictions lifted booster shots variants FDA approved widely available, could take another good year-and-half least, probably less three years. Yes yes. Prednisone plasmapheresis. paused Plex get vaccine. may pointless even small immunitt better none guess. Pfizer seems widely available option CT people sub supported massive additional suppor

I no, didn't.

No one offering concrete solutions solve issues, plenty people pretending option reopening, that's sides argument. Even insurance money, good luck finding in-person therapist. think luck plays factor anybody wants admit.  Well understand France wanted produce vaccine unable make time. help vaccination efford decided use facilities produce vaccines. could say bonus original plan. vaccine access vary based income, education race? know willingness take does, see they'd factor able get it. I'm American, maybe I'm missing something.

And even vaccine passport, Covid one recovery negative test accepted. Denmark they're rapidly ramping testing capacity enable people get tested frequently UK giving people home tests.

So really see problem short term enough people vaccinated.   wait vaccine, others get theirs, sure.

I‚Äôm sick nonsense fully vaccinated society needs mask up. Important thing note article: applies Pfizer vaccine now. research needed determine effects one dose Moderna. Thank you, learn something every day reddit. know, last time checked mass gatherings small visits banned, point really mean anything. I'm interested seeing friends than, eloquently put it, ""suck fuck crowded Denny's."" Nobody sex Denny's. trying strawman sort crazed sex maniac, really working. Yeah pointed Walgreens like week ago everyone downvoted lmao look ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I'm confused. saying believe vaccines? people question fully vaccinated. feel-good security theater good ol' fashioned jealousy second home... possible reason forcing quarantine? Damn, one medical residents work going awful dual flu/COVID season going be. made simple case viral interference social distancing would crush flu year. sensible person, agreed felt relief. Others double make facts exaggerate phenomena relevant situation quantitatively irrelevant.

There's particular verified user toxic way. I've clashed times I've learned let spread whatever misinformation logical fallacies wants spread. Downhill ways *In snow* 3 days soon accurate test? already scheduled today I'm heading soon. schedule another later week wait self monitor symptoms? (I planning second) know explanation sure, I'm guessing happens line whatever wanted believe first place. got second dose Phizer morning, came home booked ""Vacci-cation"" Mexico Fall. About? seriously think virus ...stopped virus?
That preventative measures work? people warned leave country pandemic, yet anyway. don‚Äôt care used US address jump line get vaccinated, abide rules every one else thinks reasonable time international travel. kills rights talking point ‚Äúlockup‚Äôs causing depression suicides higher ever‚Äù mean people can‚Äôt get vaccinated real option going stay home wear mask socially distance forever unfortunately. wife like 36 hours button, like flipping switch. worth noting America future health problems going financially destroy people.

So many people facing high medical costs might finally brings public option single payer. costs next decade could enormous even small fraction people suffer long term issues. He's scared, totally understandable. Approaching logical arguments going work.

The best thing positive example: get vaccine, continue perfectly normal person grown extra appendages suffered ""metal"" poisoning. Oh, vaccine? Yeah, got it. feel fine, enjoy peace mind given you. Yep, feeling fine far maybe bit tired usual. apparent week now. Still look like ""impending doom"" warned of. Variants important discussion.

I think family.  process vaccinated. 47 us avoided Covid despite wide community spread respective regions. Ironically 4 extended family members got Covid, 2 congregate care died (one 83 one special needs 56). 

We whole mostly bubbled, worn n95 masks work public, congregate unmasked Indoors eachother sometimes allow 6 days playing extra safe someone‚Äôs job put risk usual. 

I think weren‚Äôt vaccinated UK variant got bubbles would move much efficiently fast previous iterations Covid. seems like normal vaccine except bother testing 2 doses sake speed giving USP. 

For study, (the name study VAC31518COV1001, ....which really easy say, forget abbreviated name), satisfied enough results 1 shot willing give next study , nicknamed ENSEMBLE 1, try 1 injection."
