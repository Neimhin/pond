Morons went crazy superbowl, always assholes. god miss traveling going movies (or new movies general) No. True Pfizer bank rolled Well that‚Äôs reassuring.

Right. pretty much anywhere want. think point almost risk people vaccinated, people feel at-risk least guilty hanging now.

Instead, think either option 100% moral, benefits getting vaccinated outweigh moral compromise justified. position pope. (Btw, similar logic FDA used grant vaccines EUA first place, immediate benefit outweighed risk-- ideally would go full FDA approval). additional context think getting missed lot commentary vaccinations equal eyes. believe nuance comes intent cell line. One used simply validate vaccine (mRNA), key ingredient (J&amp;J). presence multiple options, makes sense they'd advocate avoiding one (J&amp;J) go others (Moderna/Pfizer).

I'll ignore second paragraph clearly non sequitur topic hand (vaccinations vs rape/pedophilia). 

This article includes example summary relative ""ethical profile"" vaccine illustrates point vaccines equal Catholic morality perspective: I'm ready hot girl summer. immune system get strong? yeah we've known based moderna/pfizer/j&amp;j commitments... america known realized. great message get entire country Everyone seems sucking koolaid matches narrative.

It's kind like Henry Ford versus Karl Benz. Sure Benz came cool tech. Ford unlocked masses. aspects really important. Mine November! Hopefully things good then! According media possible spread one vaccinated person another spread further. there's really reason make distinction close vaccinated family supermarket. Either think vaccines work transmission think don't. too! Date twins :) picky, can‚Äôt picky also get one want want. Literally helping virus anymore took human form lead Texas itself.

I‚Äôm October 2021 bride (postponed October 2020) comment + thread makes feel sooo relieved haha People going die matter what. It‚Äôs Chinese vaccine died two days later. probably put things headline. anyone hasn‚Äôt vaccinated made choice. Eventually it‚Äôs like banning fast food - isn‚Äôt good you‚Äôre gonna eat that‚Äôs business. going concert without vaccinated. stay home i'll gladly take vaccine. Regardless whether choose get vaccine change fact we'll enough doses adults end May. want them, I'm sure neighbors north south gladly take extras. Yay, I'm happy you!  data analyst refusing cook numbers?  Funny got downvoted hell calling BS J&amp;J‚Äôs initial promise output. 

These companies need underpromise overdeliver, way around didnt seem help 1918, loss magnitude peolle per capita US pandemic originated Kansas. fine lol That's win expat, come back home get shot?  Ha ! Touch√©. Depending state. Bama football (hardly lockdown friendly institution America) announced going full 110k capacity opening day Sept. know mask requirement Bama football. So, depending state type event, late summer massive maskless gatherings  slowed first foremost many already vaccinated. Many left either hardcore anti vaxxers, care bothered.

72% Israeli population eligible vaccine (over 16 years olds, never diagnosed COVID). 51.7% population vaccinated. That's \~72% eligible population.

Vaccination program bound slow down. careless way think governance. pointless burden place people, _unnecessary_ lead illnesses personal societal costs. comparison, costs us _nothing_ continue mask-wearing public indoor settings we've already months now.  **Mar. 3, 00:00 (UTC+9)**

By next school year, COVID vaccine probably required school attendance. Seriously. sub full weirdos. first I've seen. front page news TLDR: 50-year-old patient preexisting conditions (heart problems, diabetes, stroke) died hours receiving AstraZeneca vaccine. Health officials yet determine whether side effects vaccine. Florida climate lot it. Either way, haven‚Äôt movies long while.

Teachers getting vaccinated doesn‚Äôt mean kids won‚Äôt get sick class won‚Äôt still need quarantine kinda point vaccine?... ""actual data"" South America. P.1's around 3 months still know almost nothing. weirdos sub. Vaccinating younger people much important herd immunity vaccinating old people. way social. Think air flow investments worth it.

Within decade, open-air school movement come end well.  can't wait feel need wash groceries anymore well, doubt prolonged.

The thing overlooked there's vaccine kids, need rely everyone around get vaccinated. kids generally die still causes weird symptoms. I'm going completely fill mouth cotton balls put mask on. Uh, go? don‚Äôt need wait. Ok? can't vaccinate kids yet. seems strange. know Miami I've gotten multiple emails hospitals Broward Palm Beach extra doses able offer 18-65 year olds medical conditions. Yep. there's another political consideration. Opening schools *requires* vaccinating teachers, opening, say, grocery stores delivery services require vaccinating anybody.

Teachers one last groups workers genuinely powerful union. Unlike groups people (other rich, course), stand say work without vaccine.

Knowing EU miss single chance turn everything politics, already see claim chinese russian vaccines count vaccine passports. I‚Äôm saying teachers shouldn‚Äôt get priority, I‚Äôm questioning logic prioritizing underlying conditions. Obviously nobody wants get sick covid, it‚Äôs better healthy 24 year old gets covid 40 year old diabetes may considered essential also can‚Äôt socially distance work. 

I wouldn‚Äôt even care teachers got put group underlying condition folks, I‚Äôm understanding logic putting ahead people likely die covid Sounds like failing society can't take care own. I'm sure another wasteful war probably needed cards then.  placebo-controlled trial 2000 people. Placebo group got sick SA virtually much AZ group.

I don‚Äôt article hand, find easily.

Even outcome people argue AZ prevents deaths SA variant. would first vaccine ever zero efficacy light disease 100% efficacy severe. may become like Apocalympics subreddit used discuss future pandemic disasters.

Or become sub dedicated Corona beer. Texas relatively well things considered

[ehhh, right TX 24th highest (or 27th worst, 51 including D.C.) state cases per 1MM residents. also 24th highest deaths per 1MM residents. compared best state Hawaii, Texas ~5x many deaths ~4.5 many cases, per capita terms. measures, virus. agree. We‚Äôve seen many different approaches masks shutdowns. ways worked better worse? Things might go horribly Texas, maybe not.

I‚Äôm Indiana. two oldest (middle school high school) finally went back school person weeks ago. youngest (5th grade) in-person learning since last August. Based experience, doesn‚Äôt appear reopening schools really driven spread degree would justify harm keeping kids virtual learning. told months middle high schools could reopen safely, apparently can. School Board make call finally sent older kids back in-person, I‚Äôm glad did. lot doomsday rhetoric would happen did, things didn‚Äôt really pan way.

Back Texas. Abbott live decision. might work out, maybe model states reopen. Indeed, interesting see. federalism. It‚Äôs honestly ridiculous. I‚Äôm Bucks know many people driven multiple hours central PA vaccine

Like hell one densely populated areas country getting vaccines? Yeah, could've happened America shown totally inept leadership. reason America still predicament world trying move forward due incompetence failings. Everything America done exacerbated extended virus. There's reason America sick dead.

Nobody either group died. this, argue, know AZ prevents death.

This wishful thinking.

If difference outcome milder cases, even lack deaths groups, would make sense believe deaths prevented. that‚Äôs case here. enjoy on-brand What's point hierarchy anybody chain command say ""yeah, know what? I'm going that"" think lot people actually missing basic logistical issue going back person: classrooms can‚Äôt socially distance properly confined hours time including lunch schools. former rooms didn‚Äôt windows example. Lots rooms windows don‚Äôt open must remain closed due school intruder protocols. schools already use classroom space max amount teachers budget wise. Majority classrooms would really need cut half thirds order properly socially distance safe. 

Also: schools plainly don‚Äôt subs. sub, made $60 taxes, per day. Nobody risking family‚Äôs life (plus subs don‚Äôt get healthcare.) schools need subs order function- swine flu school observation hours in, shut 15% staff ill way cover classes, plus building probably needed taken care of. 

An aside- years ago shut due measles exposure abrupt three day weekend due massive lice outbreak. (I 5 28 elementary students it.) 

In grocery store least people aren‚Äôt confined one small space couple dozen people 7 hours. people try give workers room stock, cross paths worker, I‚Äôll walk around walk quickly properly double masked. take J&amp;J vaccine then. Send Americans abroad you‚Äôre finished - country (Germany) resident piss poor rollout, refuses vaccinate pregnant/breastfeeding women - meaning wont vaccinated least year. Safe effective. working Corona virus vaccine 20 years fast tracked 9 months? Somethings amiss.. We're really much better, yesterday 1,989 deaths compared brazil's 1,726, we've got 50% people we're coming much worse peak seem bad compared 4,400 day were. flu february 2018 late 20s. trouble breathing least half year afterwards. really want come back country. Vancouver really enjoyed it. Hoping Victoria next time. laughs teenage angst  WANT variants render vaccines ineffective? happens. We‚Äôre almost there...keep restrictions place weeks vaccine production ramps up.  better right. Joe Biden cannot afford call shot miss. Democrats given room error honestly trip dicks often would give any?

We can't let right gain ground especially self-inflicted shit Biden. partially nudged fit Texas Independence Day.

most definitely. Somehow Abbott overlooked (or forgot) mention TID presser today. timing unmistakable

you need go checking Texas, Dallas, Houston etc subreddits. thread Tuesday morning talking ""happy Texas Independence Day, y'all"" X comments ... 

and thread afternoon ""Gov. Abbott end COVID restrictions"" like 20x 30x comments. 100% intentional kill lot faster Covid  state isn't, 65+ 4 million seniors plus direct health care workers. lot demand softening expand.  That's cuz population density low, large population often read Britian=Bad reddit. term used brexiters? think sentiment (the bad/sad thing Britians left EU).
There difference communication officials regarding vaccines (the health ministry publishes information influence media spreads comments information). think problem bad news good click bait spreads faster.

I know single person refusing AZ vaccines. many prefering BioNTech. long choice enough options, people take preference. parts Germany allowing next priority group take AZ think good idea works well.

One quarter sounds worser is, using one half ensure second jab. they've studied long enough surely side effects would've noticed. understand it, problem earlier mRNA vaccines proven effective? nothing directly. Abbott used press conference announce ending mask mandate, allowing businesses open 100% capacity, Wed. March 10th lockdown stop virus would have, bare minimum, needed impenetrable border. Without point lockdowns doomed fail. Uh that's cuz CA enforce lockdowns mean work Even morning woke chest pains! meditated went away, none telltale signs (sweating, shortness breath, radiating pain). anxiety. driving nuts. hope tools get beyond it! Fuck this. fucking hate this. FINALLY! IT‚ÄòS TIME!! Lets get back Business ffs! Thank you! replying you. lol companies able monitor employees spend alot ad marketing conferences Flattening curve literally means lasts longer X-axis happens lot thread I'm sure why. Oregon done great job lock-down. 4th least number cases per capita one strictest lockdowns nation that's cuz nobody ask went protest....  seem replying someone else. That, think Pollyanna really liked cover bases comes mask possibilities. Meanwhile Germany, we'll probably still sitting unvaccinated next year. downvoted although agree, solidarity. Wrong Merck. You‚Äôre thinking Merck KGaA (known US/Canada EMD Serono). US Merck (known ex-US/Canada MSD (Merck Sharp Dohme)). Cool wish could long covid fact people think need kids back school order get nutrition instead stopping think hoooooly shit kids fact, lots aren‚Äôt getting nutrition right live failed society core problem here.  someone lives Texas. honesty say rules since Biden won... everyone thinks Biden vaccines... restaurants, clubs, gyms, stores packed. mean packed, really mean packed. wont change damn thing tbh. restuarant rule covering face till seat down, taking eat dumb fuck anyways lol. Ya wish thought long covid mean might work like vaccines? -- touchdown! (al michaels voice) kind point?  That's happens people ignore health orders. Meanwhile Germany......

I feel like get vaccinated year. Everything going slow. also millions doses Astra zeneca sitting fridges can't used elderly people want it. take arm ffs!  According Japanese guy talked to, masks social distancing already widespread Japan long Covid. expect science magic get mad start blaming ""ivory tower elitists"" never said magic first place

I gifted comment. I'm ""free play"" Reddit gift coins others gifted ... Goddamn turn phrase perfect

EDIT ADD: longtime Texan, co-moderator CoronavirusTX sub nearly year lmao fortunately doom gloomers stay locked houses. cross fingers time line timeline stimulus checks come through. Glad bomb countries country starving lol telling us (indirectly perhaps), hence people it. Isn‚Äôt whole point vaccine guess assuming efficacy children, one dose J&amp;J become popular one. hard convincing children get single shot; two shots gonna difficult achieve especially parents hesitant well. said, Moderna Pfizer vaccines said 90% effecive severe illness 1 shot 2-4 weeks something might recommendation trying get authorization for. Dolly really absolute legend! high really what's causing long covid mild moderate symptoms, it‚Äôs still going good preventing death. Moderna need booster, Pfizer haven‚Äôt even published results. None proven safe.. lot mega sites don‚Äôt tell day show up. Ya anxiety say going back normal Exactly. organizations verify pharmaceuticals safe also balance risk.  pipe-bomb. things made (heavy)fireworks time. uncommon Netherlands. mostly see around New Years Eve. see every year... explosion outside centre, smash Windows. yeah.. think 'planned', surprised teens this. context: village live teens arrested every year blowing things heavy fireworks self-made 'bombs'. time young, like 15-19 years old. pretty toxic 'firework-culture'. heavy stuff bought internet countries like Italy, Belgium Poland. Sometimes go get stuff themself dad's. Father-son trip sort. like think worked little niece mom hard enough mask wearing, cuz everyone family caught COVID19, except me, mom, niece, girlfriend. Literally everyone else family friends families caught lingering effects, like loss taste, smell, pain breathe, and/or constant migraines, months tested negative.

I seen many kids stores take mask eat something picked racks checkout. Kids refusing put mask, parents taking babies stores, without protection babies!

Pretty fucking sad. I'm waiting vaccines open others mentioned caught it. cousin got Moderna shot like others said, second dose knocked ass couple days. Biggest issue pain arm full experience fever points. day 3 saying back normal minor arm pain faded soon after.

So yeah, beware likely need couple recovery days. must different childhoods... funny many wary giving people handouts, favor tax credits (which essentially thing). Yeah. 2022+ going big party. still going good preventing death

We know that. severe cases either group SA study. lock downs part least great news correlation lock downs reduced cases/deaths, longer economies closed people suffer die govts, though obviously poorer countries worst effected got eu vaccines sputnik, sinopharm Per Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) used collect reports adverse events vaccination general public. primarily used identify potential topics investigate regards vaccine reactions. However, event data VAERS often verified often self-reported, assumed adverse events VAERS actually associated cause vaccines, possible estimate frequency adverse events data.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* hundreds VAERS reports cardiac events post vaccination people terrorists. would u explode probably dumbass believes fake pointing fingers play blame game. attempting get Sputnik vaccine distribution whack anyway like Russians vaccines spare. Probably even so. Children easier convince things... freezers still commercially available US. know countries Theres effectiveness virus though. start giving one dose 70% less effectiveness entire US reopen well vaccines distributed enough even given two weeks needed injection work. Texas already announced they're reopening everything, lifting mask mandate. virus spread like crazy there. last state so. 

Everytime US manages improve numbers people rush reopen things get worse. People get hope we're past it, gets worse takes longer. another set back, take longer slower methodical approach. faster right, done anything right covid country. think would right? submission linking blogspot.com automatically removed source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

I feel like sound like broken record point, *exactly* happened Florida. Florida never state mask mandate, counties cities made own. Chains like Publix require masks even county (at least one point, sure now). 

I live one big Florida cities, life never changed lifting restrictions state. Masks still required indoors county. Schools still generally require masks (also county decision). Stores still enforce masks. lot businesses continued operating reduced capacities choosing.

I see people stores wearing masks DeSantis make individual can't fined, we're talking one two people I'm shopping. mask free all. obviously exceptions, particularly SW FL, clearly enough sway metrics.

I think we'll see thing Texas. Idk, im rural area (originally, live DC now) know little people getting anything trump. aware rushed vaccine long term effects tested much want wait least 6-18 months see long term effects pop up, unreasonable (for part).

Thats say people talking exist, course do, would acting like dumbasses matter trump already believed government get president anyway  Sweden compartively done worse countries surrounding admitted put mask mandate. one saying mask forever, least everyone chance get vaccine (since kids, COVID way less severe).

It low cost restriction. 100% reopening require masks, let people choose. hard. Removing mask mandates makes difficult businesses enforce policies.

When asked why, say ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt believe government it‚Äù, reasons.

Which absurd - vaccinating rocket science. pharmacies every street corner - really needed alone could trained week. No. didn‚Äôt. That‚Äôs lie. 

There science supporting mask use general public covid. science types cloth masks people wear stop virus. 

This reason every scientific board world time recommended masks. science anything, time, believed fomite transmission huge risk. meant mask wearing could potentially cause fomite transmission science suggesting anything stop droplet transmission.

And way, US one first countries western world change stance this, done fomite transmission proven main vector transmission, new science studies produced proving masks stop covid transmission. science came later. heard discussed isreali media. think idea invest existing pharmaceutical infrastructure based big data sets. Israel's Teva fairly large manufacturing capacity apparently matters diverse medical data. actual production easy problem cost effectivly existing infrastructure making correct data driven decisions. Me. American. Living Europe amazing little hear Brazil strain compared UK SA. Really hope vaccines work well it. hard give shots Hope so! especially best vacine! :D I‚Äôm waiting someone type funky capitals mocking sort concern made towards variants past months, nothing defeats COVID like mocking fellow concerned public citizens. 

This last years. Many us many countries feel way Except Disney World‚ÄîDisney World still requires masks distancing.

Which I'm going back that's gone. stuff fun. J&amp;J‚Äôs approval US, I‚Äôve wondering Vectored vaccines like AZ J&amp;J
What happens (AZ now) receive FDA approval time? 

Are contraindications time constraints clinical trial participants received shot want receive one approved effective?

Or trial participants take gamble lose while? Surely places start asking COVID vaccine cards ""No"" -the feds Internet access absolute shit rural TN. I'm one lucky ones least access DSL. Go miles past house even get that. son's teacher cant virtual classes home, go somewhere else dial-up.

I'm even rural. house 1/2 mile town 20 minute drive city. crying though. one jailed. like seeing upset. Paywall important part buried mid-article - unlike influenza, coronaviruses one strand RNA, 8. reassortment much difficult them, way less likely. anyone even know allergic vaccines? husband seizure Tdap booster. think diphtheria part shot aren‚Äôt sure. receiving vaccines. scariest thing ever happened fortunate sitting ER waiting get stitches. people, fear real. one person knows happened. one seizure life 53 years old fully vaccinated otherwise. Two weeks post first jab AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine, nasal congestion runny nose sneezing (because runny nose). mother exact symptoms last week (1 week post vaccine jab).

I wonder get RT-PCR testing done? could started drinking refrigerated water since yesterday, iced-beverage dinner last night? slightest sore throats morning went away cup tea. fatigue; 25,000 steps far day half gone. Im crying, im laughing covid freaks :D! definitely are. guess sooner rather later we'll see doses allocated states impossible get appointment appointments sit states unclaimed. happy since interstate travel thing, selfishly would nice get vaccine point NYS. position masks honest one - science doesn‚Äôt support mask use. correct time.

The science always supported mask use. know liked Fukushima disaster?

Old Japanese people volunteered clean up, old realized little left live contribute society, young people needed stay safe order change world (the old people) started.

But guess Americans selfish. May join people quickly change tune everyone gotten little group skeptics whole world moving without them. ‚ÄúWell guess gotta get stupid shot now, (insert dumb reasoning political commentary) ‚Äú federal distribution plan, it‚Äôs states farmed local hospitals pharmacies. partner‚Äôs grandparents doctor isn‚Äôt even getting vaccine can‚Äôt store it. They‚Äôre 90‚Äôs idea get vaccine. 

This going fantasy ending whole fucking thread‚Äôs replies thinks be. still need make vaccine states like Texas (49th vaccinations) saying fuck giving now. ‚ÄúbOys BoYS‚Äù totally normal! tell obese old stay home, everyone else goes business? Can‚Äôt wait Trump take credit this. Recombination comment really current situation. Every country vaccinate tiny percentage population every day. April-July likely exponential growth vaccine deliveries, Germany cope? suggested Germany able, Germans keep telling possible. end think European countries fine. adding context.. downplaying anything  Yeah, presumably long covid symptoms improve time. improvements coincide vaccination chsnce. can't really deterimine anything without controlled study least decent amount observational data objective measures symptoms. definitely protected people then. Without masks though nobody vaccinated, would likely spread. Mississippi never mask mandate begin with. Tactic shift: vaccine producers seek vaccine overdrive supply EU order catch up. People work nursing homes hospitals first group get it. personally think should‚Äôve gone healthcare workers people underlying conditions, essential workers without underlying conditions, everyone else. life important others, people likely die get first Yeah noticed thing. Im conspiracy theory though, I'm guessing found way onto main page drew Reddit general demo onto it. lot ""Texas going kill everyone"" type stuff there.  
Personally dont think state mask mandate really much, stores still require people wore probably continue to. Actual mask wearing going take months go away. talked Pfizer deal firstly. Hungary need Sinopharm EU would accepted deal Pfizer. Pfizer+Moderna+AZ+JJ would enough. deal accepted Orban one said that's pricy. value comments showing Sinopharm trustable vaccine. majority people Hungary Europe trust all. problem Pfizer 3 others mentioned. saying Orban messed usually everything. Hopefully Roaring 20's end way October 2029  Oh agree opening like mask mandate dropped dumbass decision. people making seem like going huge increase deaths, don‚Äôt see that. likely slight increase, it‚Äôs like Florida opened suddenly shot cases compared everyone else X doubt. something like flu, shut world that.

If something like ebola could understand. death risk low population‚Äîheck, COVID less dangerous flu children. virus? /s seem plausible me. antibodies thousands different antigens. would boost antibodies one antigen cause selective decrease others. lack demand, lack people able express demand?

As far things open 100%, we‚Äôre honest they‚Äôve running around 100% occupancy anyway entire time. many variations death stats every year; cherry picking stat necessarily mean policy worked saving lives not. classic statistical correlation mean causation. 

Plus, even hard logically figure masks necessarily get people killed, number affect coronavirus deaths, deaths say, car accidents.

Okay. /s country never locked many countries lockdown much worse here, like NY much worse Florida. 

Cases deaths gonna go every time open point even lockdown first place ruins people‚Äôs lives benefits reducing cases deaths. ""two weeks flatten curve"" common sense need, common sense deserve. Yes, indeed!! means it'll available general public sooner that! harsh restrictions. conveniently forgot read rest articles know several medical experts including indian medical association criticized vaccine approval. answer arguments well. people talking claimed ""vested interests"" criticizing lack data. provide data then? approve vaccine without even completing phase 3? let remind you, asking trial data defaming scientists. That's argument child would make. Seriously. flying fuck shutting travel brasil? learned nothing?  live free die That's reasonable concern. Dr. Gottlieb convinced April vaccine floodgates open.

This. makes sense, girlfriend np large hospital.. general consensus among coworkers would rather older people get vaccinated way easier hospitals general. peoples organs melting inside out, they'll comply. big problem one potential huge societal risk minimal individual risk.

I agree though. think people much faith public health officials this. compared one Trudeau made Canada

You mean last conservative Canadian government sold country's vaccine manufacturing assets? year, could care less doctor ‚Äúthinks.‚Äù respect all.  simulation results increased binding, lab tests tissue showing increased number infected neighbouring cells fixed time, epidemiological results showing increased transmission rate. faster increase daily cases attributed higher number infected people shorter serial interval. One ask people symptom onset contact dates. I'd guess robust data collected Brazil right now. guarantee, governor starts talking mask wearers grocery store majority couple months, that's foreshadowing.  What's better doctor interviewed flip either. 

We're point people going held predictions. probably way conservative need be. Thanks! Yeah. weird cognitive dissonance. you‚Äôre wrong nervous, obviously keep level precautions what‚Äôs happening brazil terrible here‚Äôs another preprint seeming show t-cell immunity significantly impacted strain, including p.1. natural immunity insufficient, evidence points vaccine immunity job. hoping get soon. Yup, especially happens next 5-10 years. People going fall ""two weeks flatten curve"" again. one thing I‚Äôve learned government failed limiting damage Covid. Less talk action need.

Well, hopefully works out.  good arguments it.

The biggest concerns protection given wanes 2nd 3rd months first dose, much protection first dose gives variants like SA variant (if any, given uch antibody response 2nd dose responsible for) there's effect overall efficacy 2nd dose given delayed schedule.

Overall, I'm favour change, would time would prefer fully vaccinate 70 due time.  I'm sure they've weighted issues themselves. info anywhere whether timeline predictions factor recent Health Canada news storing/shipping mRNA vaccines normal-cold (not ultra-cold) temperatures?

I'm living one. likely future least years: get ready annual booster shots least 2025 take edge emerging variants reduce available pool infect. vaccinated people still get virus.....so?

I mean, can't forever vaccine stops hospilizations death....but virus transmits.....what do? Lockdown hospitals empty one dying virus ever going stop? see ridiculous is?


This end vaccines available want them, else lot people stop listening entirely, possibly even worse kinds civil disobedience vaccines PROMISED way out. Lockdowns point ridiculous. I'm floored downvoted. really trouble mentality. tempted say April 1 afraid LA/CA add additional age brackets instead general public 50-64 type lottery system. Either way don‚Äôt see hold gen pop back April 15 Makes sense though course BMI horrible measure weight. I‚Äôd encourage people use BMI calculator even don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre obese‚Äîyou could probably qualify vaccine early you‚Äôre tall go gym lol Looking like next week. three vaccines keep dying. Full stop. 
Instead media wants think you‚Äôre getting shaft don‚Äôt get Pfizer timeline every adult wants vaccine equal access end May. Sadly, agree governors feel pressure fully open idiotic move. Texas 2 months go. point can't keep seeing shut downs social distancing answer here

Shut downs, no. Social distancing can't months end longer.

That's exactly people need maintain social distancing now. people try bend rules longer whole thing going last.

We might natural advantages somewhere like New Zealand small island nation cruel authoritarianism China basically contain virus without vaccine, vaccine get virus squared away handful months instead another year right thing now.

The end July maybe even July 4th could celebrating friends almost worries. right thing now. anti maskers probably believe Neanderthals. public official. board room. called insinuation corrupted direct financial conflict interest absurd benefit anyone reading wholly unsubstantiated. someone libels someone else need called every time shady. Words meaning. There's bit buried lede think important scientists, including Murray, acknowledge outlook could improve. new vaccines, developed record speed, still appear prevent hospitalizations death even new variants cause infection. Many vaccine developers working booster shots new inoculations could preserve high level efficacy variants. And, scientists say still much learned immune system‚Äôs ability combat virus.

This situation we're lockdown forever. Yes, virus likely (and almost guaranteed point) become endemic. OK. sucks. likely we'll boosters years come.

It mean living fear virus long though-- caution smart choices.

Odds this'll endemic years, forever. Long-run likely another endemic corona deal end days. That's bad. That's something looking for! Thanks lot! Thank thinking us. We‚Äôre hanging there.

The US whatever country you‚Äôre referencing Hey, least mask mandate.

NY might end restrictions sooner person controls currently embroiled multiple scandals might want distract public from. predict CA last state significant restrictions. Hmmm...seems viewpoint pandemics could larger viewpoint first global shuttering due climate change. Pandemics caused climate change warned years. coronavirus isn‚Äôt mammalian pandemic right now. don‚Äôt see prosperity without either 1) large societal changes reduce emissions 2) negative emission carbon capture invention today exist (or least meaningfully scaled). 

I know that‚Äôs pessimistic acting like everything fine coronavirus feels overly optimistic. still see would estimate 85 93% wearing masks part mississippi, got first pfizer shot krogers..next couple weeks now.

She got vaccine, contracted covid days later died, span two weeks.

What makes sad died covid getting vaccine 33. That‚Äôs tough. understand that, perhaps corners cut middle pandemic, millions high risk people waiting appointments. vaccine really better likely slight chance significant difference ethnic groups? 

I‚Äôm curious history looks like. ever vaccine whose effectiveness impacted substantially specific ethnicity? virus finished least couple years. already different variants already spread faster original virus.

The powers already said booster shots may needed back firsttime vaccines 8 months late. worry, real weak, Brazilians can't afford going US vacation right starters dont think really true. California pretty well relaxed everything. Florida one constant outbreak basically year.

But importantly, logical conclusion California Florid ""similar numbers"" would California didnt good job locking down. absolutely nothing (IE: Florida) locking down. team got second Pfizer dose last week. 8 us, one felt bad enough call day after. Everybody little something different-- Fatigue, fever, chills, headache-- sore arm day. Herpes still thing, dude. Well, fair immune, probably still point.

I mean, seriously, 60 days we'll probably 100 million people vaccinated 30 days probably 2/3's county. can't wait another 60 days? ton studies yet, two referenced show astoundingly high rates unfortunately. Florida open since last summer. two factors:

1. Kids
2. Arabs

Kids teens age 20 46.5% new cases see \- demographic vaccinated. Furthermore, another 32.4% 20-40 age bracket 32% 41% populations 2cond dose.

Arabs significantly lower vaccination rate general public 30% two weeks 1st dose recovered, compared ultraorthodox 39% (likely much higher due number undocumented recoverees) rest public 57%. currently 2.5-3 times new severe cases per million compared Ultraorthodox general pop see Good. Yassssssss!!!!!!!!!!!! Yes, pertaining 501Y.V2. know current mRNA vaccines ""two thirds reduction"" 501Y.V2. read current vaccines still help prevent death hospitalizations even 501Y.V2.

But want also know long term COVID syndrome 501Y.V2 vs current 2 dose Pfizer/Moderna vaccines. heard much that. someone young, never worry much hospitalization death. lot younger folks long term lingering effects.  Hey, remember time U.S. bombed Iranian-backed militias Syria last week?  Mines May 22, get feeling much. people angry scared. claim everyone Florida Iowa would dead? would Super Bowl Spreader? Newsom Cuomo good jobs? could turn drinking game, maybe. Abbott really hopes kill poor people get vaccinated. source potential negative long-term effects worse flu? flu also also long-term lasting effects similar ways Covid.  There's need worry. They're thinking variants, small chance there's dangerous one we'll get booster shot fast.

The absolute worst could happen recommendation wear mask public transport weeks. Nothing besides that. wrote quick program summation. reinfection random, we'd expect 4592 re-tests 3/2.

Sorry. Anti-maskers Q-anon invaded site. Go /r/collapse accepting minds.  see lots people thinking terrible idea. It‚Äôs limited supply vaccines used have. since getting 100 million+ vaccines shipped around country month alone, state governments able advance vaccine tiers faster, eventually away them. good news neighbors north south. easy keep excess production capacity online shipping Canada, Mexico beyond. 8 months late, better late never.

All interesting, hard say means information. true! swear mf goodness!!! friend went dentist teeth hurt three days vaccine first thing dentist asked was, ""did get vaccine?"" pull three teeth rotting out! He's seen multiple times recently leading visit. Maybe try ordering glasses online? couple years ago friend suggested it, worked great me. Even cheaper getting frames person.

The downside they'll old prescription, though.

Good luck. That's huge amount conjecture seemingly absolutely actual medical knowledge behind it, simply entirely based ""I've anxiety anything vague similarities anxiety well! one medical issue understand, must answer everything!"".  
 
Here's thoughts actual immunologist, note various hypothesis based actual physical issues relating virus. 
  
This sub always rather childlike view long-covid along lines ""no! want real not!"" hand-waving away anxiety, based zero actual knowledge, goes along that, helpful slightest. Just...no. Dare tho? May 28 me! Saying ""eh"" end senteblnces makes everything bettef actually know people don‚Äôt want vaccine do! think availability great attempt scare people safe backfired lmao I‚Äôm sure understood that, but

nice. May say vaccine isnt 100% effective. doesnt need herd immunity kick good portion populations vaccinated. still significant community spread, people dont get protected vaccine typically going vulnerable virus. Belgium's covid cases remained constant level since late December hospital admissions whereas UK whilst cases coming rate admissions/deaths plunging alot faster first wave

All saying evidence AZ working well 65s countries Europe need stop political tantrum start saving lives legitimately idiot. several trips booked fall cannot wait done this, including Vegas. think I‚Äôd going Vegas scared? Sure wouldn‚Äôt, scared idiots like messing everything up. hey, since naming viruses hypothetical country origin again? get feeling. talking wife speculating pandemic remembered media basically blurted ‚Äúwhen done never want talk, read, hear again.‚Äù suspect I‚Äôm far one. Obviously want lessons learned authorities remembered, beyond nothing. Kids usually stick pretty tight bubble though  there‚Äôs less chance picking Covid like adults can. Yes kids could get Covid chances you‚Äôll aware got trace that. vaccine nothing decrease hospitalizations death. Like chicken pox cold, Covid hope long term issues. Ok, food ready. heard me. need get high horse. 

""Don't take vaccine used cells manufacturing originally grown fetus decades ago, overlook decades long covering child sex abuse.""

Talk morally compromised. I'm assuming vaccine also stops new variants? I‚Äôve working industry sense 2005. People generally don‚Äôt concept works. kids greater risk flu, Im worried that. spread among worst case get basically cold Also good option reluctant citizens.

""I want vaccine freedoms Bill Gates gonna put microchip me..."" \*fwoomp\* JAB Ow! Problem solved. Like almost year. üòÇ

~~I hate here~~ governors resist opening *everyone* vaccinated. flaunt federal guidance help.

This fall we're going see interesting fight whether schools fully reopen certain districts fall. going major issues remedial education missed healthcare. absolutely massive issues related evictions bankruptcy looming. industries businesses year depending restrictions lifted, going another many years number industries even close normal again. Different governments going make worse multiple different ways.

But yes, people mostly go back life normal regardless happening. article talking reinfection natural infection. Since vaccines give robust immunity natural infection, math probably correct. probably expect vaccines reduce deaths hospitalisations even variants, need studies certain that. human lives important politics. claiming 100% vaccination. 
They claiming enough supply reach 100% vaccination. [YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE First dose sore arm fatigue. Second dose headache body aches. gone within 24 hours so. Exactly! get covid test quickly, easily, cheaply, put mind ease contagious act accordingly. aggregate, makes huge difference. Blanket lockdowns business closures much less targeted tool relied much lieu testing. east Asia great right Europe US struggle hard. link gives source rankings including cost. asking back claim America top 10 exclude cost okay openly lying us? MuH vArIaNtS.

No one cares dude. cold isnt scary matter many lies make up. Speaking variants... actual rigorous scientific data supports hypothesis variants even existing? Oh right... No, ignorant enjoy it. limit exist! miss something? airports say mandate masks? hope Astrazeneca also PEG-free?  

Both mRNA vaccines PEG-based sadly. Thank proving point! Yes, assume based uptake assumption &lt;70%. truly intend enough doses covered 220 million doses (whether take not) incredible ramp production relative today.

2nd ‚Äòsource‚Äô - saw clip clearly said REGISTER get online get line vaccination. critical thinking skills lead believe means it‚Äôs difficult people find register get appointment vaccine. clip posted say don‚Äôt know USE INTERNET.

‚ÄúAny level protection‚Äù 95% protection different things. Pzifer vaccine 95% effective within 2 weeks. Couple things. First keep mind it‚Äôs 66% reduction existing risk. 10 people worked place Covid positive people trying infect yes, 3 4 people would get it. base rate risk much lower.

Regardless rate, it‚Äôs 100% effective preventing hospitalization death caused Covid, that‚Äôs important metric one reasons everyone excited it. exactly‚Äî start opening one vial (10 doses). doses completed 6 hours, vaccine goes bad. vaccinating 10-4. week two, started vaccinating 20 people, second vial might opened noon could potentially last till 6. incredibly smart corporate providing extra hours help Covid vaccine process. get vaccines done timeframe prescriptions. doesn‚Äôt make much sense me. happening... even remotely.

People given year lives help prevent spread virus. asking people give another summer (AKA give many social events can't done Zoom call) make sure extra people vaccinated.

Not happening.. even remotely....

You thinking future. continue push shutdowns cause people completely reject reasonable measures next time pandemic. effects lockdown? Depression, addiction, job loss?

Thankfully plenty states know continued lockdowns good idea. people states locked fly states vacation. covid fizzles out. trump gone keep acting like real threat Yeah idiots make decisions worked much better ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è people get vaccine remember surge subscribers mid march early april. getting like 100k day news flooded 100k people times feed flooded covid news It‚Äôs 100% preventing hospitalizations death.

If effectiveness sole metric approve vaccines, wouldn‚Äôt thing flu vaccine. Canadian kicking rock lonely road....eh know we‚Äôll coming restrictions (presumably) instead apart celebrating mean baby boom Feb2022? Masks, proper social distancing quarantining would stopped spread ""almost immediately.""  book could get finish high school ""One day, like miracle, disappear."" Biden also said didn‚Äôt vaccine took office, so... Safeway.com week, get option select ‚Äú2 dose vaccine‚Äù ‚Äú1 dose‚Äù first time. I‚Äôm guessing easily solveable problem. Yup. I‚Äôve teachers class learning getting vaccinated. It‚Äôs worth quarantine issue brought alone. pointing majority teachers *have* classroom year, WFH. 

The districts home year seemingly dragged back classroom kicking screaming, even they‚Äôve gotten vaccinated. I‚Äôm trying figure unions districts actually representing, teachers know want classroom post vaccination. definitely aren‚Äôt representing kids. want stay home cower fear. Go it. want go fun. Go it. 

There‚Äôs plenty preventative measures people take they‚Äôre worried COVID. almost year, needs start personal choice. How‚Äôs orange mushroom taste George? sorry loss. Right?? kthaxBYE ü§ûüòÇ  Covid 19. risk spreading it. girlfriend educator traveled another state get hers. worth round trip. still can‚Äôt believe didn‚Äôt mind credentials state bosses said trip possible sure enough‚Äî 1/2 vaccinated.  listen go open mind? Stop brainwashed. second kid 2 weeks everything locked killed yet. We're good! Oh gave great idea! ought try something mom turns 65 july - hopefully get vaccinated then. It‚Äôs sad lazy puts BMI 35, I‚Äôm 1b get vaccine pushed - whereas autoimmune issues don‚Äôt qualify anything. 

My parents aren‚Äôt ‚Äúparty‚Äù people - could still scheme something nice dad. bad rate. comparison's sake, annual flu vaccine efficacy rates hover around 40%. 66% normal acceptable efficacy rate vaccine. Also, 66% number reference ""moderate severe"" disease. much effective (85%) severe disease, showed 100% efficacy hospitalizations deaths clinical trial. That's really matters. broad public health perspective, matter people get moderate severe COVID one hospitalized dies. really appreciate entire damn globe participating covid sham election. 

/s fuck virus still spreadable vaccine tho lmao easy money (printing) led party times. Mass vaccination sites generally drive thru. live Illinois. ‚Äúmass testing sites‚Äù drive thru. Good news: faster access vaccines people aren‚Äôt stupid. 

Bad news: lower chance herd immunity. Killing constituents Joe Biden awfully stupid ask lol Nope. Already year. states reopening fully. 2 - 3 months soon become 6 months 2022... So, one would completely vaccinate county four days. numbers gave Netherlands only. weekly deliveries April doubled Netherlands, EU countries. cracked up, thank üòÇüòÇ Seems like it, checked NC parents live stage 3 giving essential workers working person, basically covers everyone working office job hanging home. Aerosol transmission still air. 

Their position masks honest one - science doesn‚Äôt support mask use. correct time. 

They remain correct asymptomatic spread. It‚Äôs incredibly rare. Secondary attack rates home place 1 percent. studies put five percent transmissions. You‚Äôre likely confusing presymptomatic spread asymptomatic spread. so, may wish take step back ask you‚Äôre qualified come conclusions have. I‚Äôm ‚Äúessential worker‚Äù I‚Äôm hoping get one *sometime.*

Again, give examples here. Show evidence calling ‚Äúbullshit‚Äù. talk unemployment, poor GDP, terrible governance around along clear day divide rule policy.

I could give dozen examples crimes happening beyond sane human could do, point you‚Äôll ask go Pakistan you‚Äôll cry can‚Äôt say anything good India. 

The reality is, there‚Äôs little good left say country. many things wrong system today won‚Äôt face it, won‚Äôt counter facts, don‚Äôt evidence, lack logic. cannot counter GDP, unemployment, horrific policies government introducing every day. 

You aren‚Äôt blind follower, you‚Äôre uninformed, immature, unpractical person cannot face reality based evidence.

*administer* This.... 9/11 world-changing impact lasting impact always far anything covid could ever hope achieve. want cry tears joy right üò≠üò≠üò≠ lengthy well cited post didn‚Äôt refute said all. seasonal flu pretty nasty kids get. isn‚Äôt 0 concern, phrase ‚Äòjust flu‚Äô ignores flu pretty bad disease. So, Covid less dangerous seasonal flu still unpleasant, serious even kill kids. Lmao imagine stupid Well said. ADA piece legislation know could reasonably used way avoid private business requiring certain piece clothing, mask. However, ADA say let someone shop store able wear clothes ask to, says make reasonable accomodations. Reasonable accommodations could something like curbside pickup even delivery vast majority store texas thanks services like shipt.

As hypothetical, someone disability made someone looked nose person %1 chance dying can't breath face covered, requiring person shop without entering store shop would completely acceptable form accommodation. Honestly, hope get tourists NY Spring/Summer. city hurt economically pandemic shit gotten unsafe become emptier. never thought would say miss tourists.  still got 200,000 deaths till US surpasses deaths WW1 1918 flu pandemic combined faith US hit numbers. Add Newsom that! CA isn‚Äôt opening much anything many places. mask mandate made clear impact Texas though, mandate went place long noticeable drop cases. 

The mandate gives private businesses something point authority someone tries disrupt business. mandate makes much harder enforce around.

Last least, there's real concern Texas spawn new variant immune vaccine. social distance mask critical mass vaccinated, run real chance ruining whole vaccination effort. cruises interesting.
 
I'm curious whether pandemic helped teach people wash hands cough other,  kind doubt it. guess manifests psychological defense behavior certain uncomfortable things declared something else. Like long term damage caused covid declared anxiety. lack response? many places still seems bottleneck actually administering shots sites. open 65+ currently impossible get appointment despite supposedly enough supply. county numbers show 50% eligible population gotten least one shot. opens groups gonna even harder. Unless sites open up, seems like going take couple months get everybody even doses available. Bullshit  81 nursing homes deaths? legit? so, feel like idiot outraged her. 

How Cuomo kill tens thousands nursing home scandal Michigan didn‚Äôt even hit 100 using policy? sources government policy. Medical experts knew covid saying single lockdown would enough friends started traveling last September. Tourism booming everywhere still ""hard"" ""lockdown"". curbside thing corona, people utilize much.
 
I intention going back shopping store, since shop online week, order, pick groceries 15 minutes lunch.
 
it's convenient.

I done delivery, imagine would even better home. didn‚Äôt say ‚Äúthey won‚Äôt back normal summer won‚Äôt vaccine summer‚Äù?

I thought late-April 2020 proven right past 11 months. Sky blue feel elated right now, really starting hit light end tunnel.

I feel way too, information coming vaccine production ramping up. However, light *end* tunnel still it. continue wearing mask fucked don‚Äôt want j j vaccine would prefer moderna pfizer vaccine? don‚Äôt trust media clinical trials saying 100% vaccines prevented deaths Covid?

I mean know would say fucked up, definitely pretty bizarre think AZ J&amp;J straight fictionalized raw data COVID deaths clinical trials think also juice top line efficacy numbers look bit better. Assuming enough adults get vaccine. XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD Yup. live NYC walking way getting anywhere. I'd walk 5 miles day average get work run errands. sudden went absolute zero. fucked hard. think argument take batshit insane risks little gains risk creating new opportunities virus mutate.

Once adults vaccinated, put kids back school face face. know data right COVID less likely kill kids flu. That's acceptable risk would taking, even risk mutations.

Pre-maturely opening could potentially everyone vaccinated 2 months stupid. Masks near zero cost restriction. reason away Masks 2 months left. one claiming ‚Äòdid‚Äô everything, least I‚Äôm not. logic behind prioritization dosage goes. Several doctors reported surge younger patients Covid-19 wards, many 30s 40s underlying health problems. Peru, doctors said patients becoming seriously ill faster, three four days first symptoms emerged, compared average nine 14 days last year.

This extremely disconcerting true, shame article cites anecdotes hearsay instead actual data. Even data released single hospital single city. proportion 30s 40s hospitalizations total hospitalized? Proportion total deaths? NOPE, none Doctors also reported rise hospitalizations deaths younger patients, researchers concluded younger people getting seriously ill people infected overall. likelihood younger people dying increased, said, hospitals overwhelmed, variant deadly.

Well gosh, WSJ, case Brazil? Well, actual DATA article, perhaps would get better idea. parents -- even rich ones -- want kids back school they're tired childcare available. group influential people higher risk complications death. Tennessean here.....you guys state wide mask mandate? May won't. actual doses made end May. We've still got long ways go. good news fast progress, kind everyone thinks is. 

People disagree want, prepared May still wont vaccine. get hopes something Biden media said. never said Vaccinated end May. keep seeing thread asking evidence clinical trials long-term efficacy single dose vaccines evidence change course, concrete evidence long-term efficacy current Pfizer/Moderna 2 dose vaccines. There's also concrete evidence JJ vaccine 1 dose confers longer immunity single dose 2 dose vaccines. Phase III trials what, 4 months long? virus barely year old. ""Long-term efficacy"" vaccine point speculation.

Point is, there's lot know, lot time, lot hard decisions amount educated guesses made people smarter I. Really? CDC site says 102milliom distributed 78 million administered. That‚Äôs 76% math. Pfizer create fund vaccine. German company biontech created funded German government. Pfizer producing it. I‚Äôm downplaying importance production, simply responding someone claiming everything. According Worldometer, US actually came second place Brazil new cases today. We're longer number 1! different argument still vaccinating want 2022 spring winter. seems pretty unlikely. Judging speed vaccination current speed shaky logic regardless think majority willing people vaccinated. Thank OP putting critical word ‚Äúadult‚Äù headline. widely reported incorrectly.

There vaccines approved children yet.   Pope already tell guy fuck issue? feel like trying get defrocked. I'm focused twitter, topic thread moron.

Nothing post even hints referring people getting vaccinated again. Yeah, dude. *That's* problem. I'm underestimating Twitter's ability successfully act arbiter truth.

Imagine fucking stupid. Still salty? cute  really need better education system comments like spits out. really feel like mask mandates basically last measure go. unobtrusive relatively effective. would favor keeping least everyone priority group vaccinated. Yeah, fair point, guess main point first post people know well dont medical conditions anything make hesitant get vaccine. seems foolish irresponsible they're getting it.

I'm saying people medical issues want certain first, even then, way vaccine works likely cause long term side effects. people medical issues sure listen doctors. Repeating sorts lies real harm kids. Kids die fron social isolation, abuse neglect due disinformation.

Worst case scenario, staggers people get sick longer, someone dies, someone seriously injured illness remain sick even longer. pass others infect businesses... shitshow want avoid. least NY, already planning pilot options. J&amp;J doses mass vaccination sites given different appointment times announcing advance, would know vaccine signing for. said, many J&amp;J doses yet compared RNA ones, might take time see pans out. Well, that's good. Truly haha. many breakdowns course year happens first year college. Lonely, friends (online classes make virtually impossible create friendships), lack human connection mostly what‚Äôs making crack. typing realize basically described loneliness 3 different ways haha.

Naturally, feel bit sad. hey, least commute! wake roll bed class, don‚Äôt feel bad us. Considering US secured vaccines entire populatuon companies, awesome news rest world means would lift export ban :) Stop. get erect. Don‚Äôt forget evil maskless celebrations Bama too.

So many ‚Äúsuper spreaders‚Äù literally weren‚Äôt! Imagine that. truly felt different vibe past week two. Like light finally visible end tunnel. don‚Äôt want get overzealous get there. I'm point prefer wearing PAPR (respirator) Covid unit 12 hours wearing mask 12 hours working non Covid patients. least PAPRs airflow blowing head. forsee effectiveness J&amp;J vaccine. fact keeps well means doses shipped vaccines arms much favorable. parent wouldnt let house get vaccine. Also id wear two masks ever leave house think it‚Äôs important useful officials encouraging people take whatever vaccine available instead waiting though

Yeah definitely. reasons people might prefer one vaccine another time trying inform/correct people who, say, don‚Äôt think J&amp;J‚Äôs efficacy good enough I'm tired hearing stuff like ""we need part get vaccine"" news I'm even close able get it. get people saying God damnit can't anything! work healthcare moved back California (last year) Texas completely agree you.

Instead letting people outside risk almost none, state literally said goal keep everyone home. 

And cases continued skyrocket plummeting late summer levels. Despite restrictions...

Go figure. Place went 6 nurse one doctor sitting around waiting giving shot 2 min done. Sat waiting area 15 min. way home.  Maybe people need get act together. 7.7 percent Americans vaccinated. 3 months. really think we're going vaccinate 80 percent wants vaccine May? hundreds millions doses? 

The messaging President wonky. means we'll acquired doses we'll administer them. everyone wants dose vaccinated end May. Hard disagree. We're gonna get recession double digit inflation next couple years. economic leading indicators looks frightening. think rise level human intellect care blame self-preservation. climate scientist told likely, may enough mastery anything even wanted to. Yeah. ""May""
Anyone really looks safety efficacy numbers produced see parody. never read test papers says, listenin lies many ""may"" ""maybe"".

Test papers maybe complicated read. read news: case Pfizer, example, company recruited 43,661 volunteers waited 170 people come symptoms Covid-19 get positive test. 170, 162 received placebo shot, eight received real vaccine.

From numbers, Pfizer‚Äôs researchers calculated fraction volunteers group got sick. fractions small, fraction unvaccinated volunteers got sick much bigger fraction vaccinated ones. scientists determined relative difference two fractions. Scientists express difference value call efficacy. there‚Äôs difference vaccine placebo groups, efficacy zero. none sick people vaccinated, efficacy 100 percent. 

A 95 percent efficacy certainly compelling evidence vaccine works well. number doesn‚Äôt tell chances becoming sick get vaccinated. own, also doesn‚Äôt say well vaccine bring Covid-19 across United States.

What‚Äôs difference efficacy effectiveness?

Efficacy effectiveness related other, they‚Äôre thing. vaccine experts say it‚Äôs crucial mix up. Efficacy measurement made clinical trial. ‚ÄúEffectiveness well vaccine works real world,‚Äù said Naor Bar-Zeev, epidemiologist Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School Public Health."" Talk doc believe guidelines different different meds Pro musician here. Let gigs come! Florida literally fired epidemiologists tried accurately report Covid data there. numbers state likely bad worse TX. think pretty easy-to-solve problem - say J&amp;J vaccines pile people current tier want them, open distribution sites using J&amp;J next tier. think important useful officials encouraging people take whatever vaccine available instead waiting though, (accurately) explaining vaccines extraordinarily protective. I'm asking to, saying ""note absence stats"" frequency study makes sense. get erotic might catch virus  AIDS bad ... bad condemns.  


Hard argue Catholic logic. That‚Äôs real risk though, 80 I‚Äôm excited get second dose 3 weeks practically funded vaccine. named far modest Idk appointments fully booked. Can't even get callback fir info. Obesity least check on-site, conditions, Im assuming doctor's note something similar. May honor system reduce number hurdles, especially lower-income groups. see evidence covid causes heart damage actual human beings rate higher common viral diseases, see care all. hate concerts, might go one can. want Aladeen news Aladeen news? makes sense, many epidemiologists Michael Osterholm suggested current vaccination efforts significantly contributed huge case hospitalization drops - yet . 

I get point that‚Äôs think shouldn‚Äôt keen opening things reversing mask mandates. can‚Äôt give variants much opportunity spread. way significantly curtail vaccination efforts couple months public health measures. vaccines proven still effective variants. get people vaccinated potential surge , open later. personally can‚Äôt wait day masks social distancing thing past. seems like we‚Äôre getting closer that. need bit patient. Sounds like get offended people something hurts one. Sure, silly wear mask alone, cares. Dont say here, ""long covid"" part religious doctrine  Poor decision. Poor leadership.  vaccines designed protect people getting covid infected virus, stop spreading further. could still case, far understand it, yet conclusive data science undecided. That's see kind recommendations vaccinated persons (masks, distancing, throwing parties etc) depends guess.

This could change though, data comes studies held countries vaccination come long way, like Israel. never doubted science. optimistic logistics. Enough everyone June outstanding. thing doubt remains same. solid chunk country still thinks vaccine implant Bill Gates mind control device bodies. care enough get vaccine.

Stupidity biggest obstacle here. always been. mean? UK's 3 lockdowns numbers cases deaths cratered time. first one came first second one numbers grew exponentially. evidence work overwhelming. work somewhere else lockdown must applied differently adhered differently.  understand perspective, would frustrating watch people shop around long still tiers leave vaccines sitting around Please say aint so! wife living foreign country since began seen friends family since January 2020. eager get back US weeks soon safe.  Thank you! Whats guys process that? California starting March 15th, yet information. get doctors note take anywhere honor system strictly doctors' offices? Fuck would hope so! Railroad Earth Nope wait mine? Yay!! Kids vaccinated. People forget this. risk able go everywhere. heads - stands today, 15 states state mask mandate. rationale presented state obviously based different metrics respective Governors signed (usually including ‚Äúability hospitals adequately handle‚Äù Covid patient caseload). I‚Äôm claiming that‚Äôs best course action them, sharing reality.

Texas become 16th state statewide mask mandate. 3 10 states mandate. no, French medical rules here.

*angry hon hon hon* like Mexico... poor LA. People deserve better :( Lots first dose AZ US missing right now. FDA looking UK curves cursing themselves. open fully Olympics, can't keep economy service industry tanking anymore. answer

Loser loses bet. sometimes wonder ""Don't Tread Me"" contingent, say, served kind stoke stratification, encourages others get entrenched dogma ""other team"". so, suspect would smart sort spy ops move seeking muddy conversation sow social unrest. majority world sadly.

Just hope get US passport renewed soon, make quick quarantine trip US vaccine, enjoy summer EU much possible I'm assuming referring Rebekah Jones, data scientist fired raid home recently? [She's get that. messaging issue results lost translation effect scientists normally speak public hears. [This piece Atlantic put Thus, January 14, 2020, stated ‚Äúno clear evidence human-to-human transmission.‚Äù said, ‚ÄúThere increasing likelihood human-to-human transmission taking place, haven‚Äôt yet proven this, access Wuhan, China.‚Äù (Cases already popping around world point.) Acting human-to-human transmission early weeks pandemic would wise Later spring, officials stated ‚Äúcurrently evidence people recovered COVID-19 antibodies protected second infection,‚Äù producing many articles laden panic despair. Instead, said: ‚ÄúWe expect immune system function virus, provide immunity period time, still hard know specifics early.‚Äù  Anti scientific, religious. I've hearing year now. person asked -- Texas teacher unions. ""associations"" offer legal help pinch, collective bargaining here. even talk going strike, risk forfeiting job, certification money state retirement system. shit's fucked, yo Even though still cancelling concerts summer. stupid. Ugh totally bums out. Five years ago August husband spent Honeymoon Disney World promised we'd go back five years time. celebrate graduation one last hurray starting family. I'm sure there's thousands people plans. 

But I'm Canadian anyway, probably vaccinated ability travel 2022. There's probably going huge 'second wave' travellers Canadian Americans traveling months. think right COVID fatigue. seriously crushing CA while, took long.

Also huge disparities throughout state. People Bay Area still complying, case numbers reflect this.

We also ton people working food supply chain, always considered ‚Äúessential.‚Äù know lot going I'm surprised research conducted earlier. US fucked lot past couple years need logistics machine. It‚Äôs insane accomplished halfway competent leaders. No, that, strange care vaccine get. allowed choose, compared ""my body choice"" talking different. Sounds like last-mile problem. government secured supply, get states pharmacies, need get arms - limited number people would hold basic medical knowledge enough trusted administer them. time-gated observe people adverse reaction vaccine case. You‚Äôve contributed real content conversation. unverified news source snarky ‚ÄúLOL.‚Äù got pissy got called it. nice day What's point ending mask mandate? least keep that? Ugh. Ridiculous. Hope restore international friendships. would wager good money polls incredibly wrong. I'll say end summer (if supply truly problem) 10% population refuse. really many true antivax people there. Many skeptical, everyone see entire social circle got vaccinated fine.

A lot people want first line. know potential increased risk kids newer variants? old ""adult""? I'm eager vaccine, also fully prepared wait older risk get first! They‚Äôre *realistic* they‚Äôre scientists. soon scientists start pushing agenda numbers don‚Äôt support wary. Pharmacies county recently caught throwing away leftover vaccines end day instead distributing vaccines people waitlists. 

Also, currently 1,258 open appointments next three days second largest drive vaccination clinic county, they‚Äôre inexplicably restricted 65+. They‚Äôre literally defrosting vaccines every day distribute, throwing away there‚Äôs one left fill 65+ *and* essential category. Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha.

Okay, kid. know, right!? got taste independence straight back parents' house. Might miss remote learning, though. started argument saying something shitty got mad stood won‚Äôt take shit wrong on. 8? intelligent person? You‚Äôve proven aren‚Äôt result, Canada fucked okay. Biden real putting America first. job he's well. 'physical reality situation' sure getting Florida's way, Texas.

Try again.  Orgiastic? Like show years ago ""The Last Man Earth"" virus wipes humanity 2020... ""hates fucking tennessee"" list short? we're definitely going world's biggest party right? Like Woodstock steroids. US first order approve finance lot development, it‚Äôs fair get doses initially. EU ordered 300 millions vaccine J&amp;J confirmed delivered year. Yeah, happen read erratic place. Gotcha. Thanks. would think also lower risk developing life threatening symptoms, makes sense.

Have good night! buy argument. Grocery store workers essential workers. Without people would starve. They've going work whole pandemic, risking lives dying covid whole time. Meanwhile, teachers getting vaccinated them, they've collecting salary teaching remotely zero risk themselves. Teachers prioritized they're ""essential"" - they're prioiritized people sick kids home want state sponsored day care back.

Seriously tho it‚Äôs great news, wanna get back school September. Wishing best Canada! vaccine September *earliest* kind enclosed space. boat. born 2020 interesting time think  Family living Hawaii spent 8 yes there. Need tips ill happy answer questions! I'm visiting summer Bruh came first. can‚Äôt handle people giving back don‚Äôt go them. Yes work healthcare US. vaccine craziness. Half people don‚Äôt want half making appointments. people actually need vaccine vaccinated April. Can‚Äôt exactly vaccinate 330 million we? Especially two shot vaccine one month apart. Use little common sense‚úåüèΩ Really depends state - different tiers. plans better published, others kind playing ear. Yep, requires signed confirm eligibility schedule appointment.  caught covid recovered early December 2020. yesterday, fully vaccinated, double dosed everything. 

Why legally mandated wear mask? live California it‚Äôs literally illegal step outside apartment without mask. Why? Pick 1,000,000 people random. time tomorrow 20 died. America vaccinating 1,000,000 per day law averages says 20 die within 24 hours getting jab. vaccine dangerous, lack math skills driving public perceptions could though. Every trial runs different parameters cannot compare vaccines efficacy numbers. Real world data far allows compare single dose AZ Pfizer 70+ age. seems AZ works better. Rs Trump Don‚Äôt mess good circle jerk. ‚Äúno way goes past Memorial Day‚Äù

No way would go past Memorial day? virus going stop spreading people revolting, think implying people ok risking lives. substantial fraction Americans dumb, many. dad Silent generation get appointment always already full checking several times per day weeks. finally gave website phone number, called asked doctors office options. took info called back less 10 minutes date, time, location first shot. Got last week appointment second. literal first thing found. I'm pretty sure could find better sources. False narratives?

Who pissed god damn Cheerios?

Also, sense work healthcare too... Don‚Äôt worry it. Lots states basically already fully opened long time (ie last April) people silently hanging homes everywhere anyway won‚Äôt make much difference American Catholics don‚Äôt believe this, hard core crazies. Every religion crazies, welp one ours. hear you‚Äôre saying, yes, fantastic job working home. 

But go whatever percent closed 100% open? once? state believe second US cases? state already struggles actually wearing masks, keeping distance? done stages, sure. guy initially responded stated vaccines developed us going going, us. merely pointed out, one three vaccines available us created us. Apparantly gotten good amount peoples jimmies rustled. People dying? get vaccine I‚Äôm going buy candy give everyone. EVERYONE! accept HUG them. HUGGGGGGG. Goes login page. So, news Texas ‚Äú100% opened‚Äù every covid strain found Houston, going rest USA? 

I‚Äôm going keep masking, many people getting tired it. going cause massive rise cases? Trying understand impact going have. Thanks advance information get better understanding! source fired epidemiologists ""trying accurately report cases"". claim. source?
   
Also, claim manipulating death toll underreporting want look excess mortality average country, stat would able hide cover up. that's state emergency for. Closing bars early means average salaryman works long hours able get drink on.

The Japanese mostly wear masks cos following gov blindly like think. like cultural conformity. don't, seen odd one want that. young age, they've raised conform. pros cons this, obviously pro pandemic.

Where original spread from? like said - drinking. Japanese also fond going drinking work bosses colleagues. Long periods cooped tightly together without masks (cos can't really drink on) caused spread. Outside nightlife, community spread kinda non-existent. news always give clear picture, narrative sell.

Bond markets acting weird, Fed balance sheet increasing end sight, eviction moratorium paired significant percentage people behind rent mortgages, asset bubbles everywhere look (look @ lumber prices), outrageous P/E ratios stock market. Everything looks peachy now, lot red flags there. Texans know happy Sounds like Wisconsin , thing p facts *can* catch/spread viruses outdoors come contact someone (although rare indoors), touching mask unless able wash hands before/afterwards (kind hard wash hands car). 

It's ViRtuE SiGnAlInG Whoever hand this. THANK YOU! sub saying 2 months back October/November. It‚Äôs time. you‚Äôre worried make personal call keep masking and/or stay home. manufacturer currently met delivery contract terms. brand new; mRNA vaccines tested years. none proven effective before. much stress talking that's causing long covid, think that's case lol SA claimed effective mild symptoms. reality AZ still 100% effective death. ""The vaccine still appears fully effective preventing hospitalisation death caused variants coronavirus, according data studies."" Source: problem debate different people studies mean ""effectiveness"". think thing care effectiveness death caused Covid. criterium difference Pfizer, Moderna, AZ probably new vaccines too. appear 100% effective. attention people, media subreddit though switching effectiveness mild symptoms like coughing twice slightly raised temperature. I'm honestly mesmerized can't believe people seriously refusing take 100% effective vaccine might get slight fever. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs White Castle. dude/dudette. finished last night went youtube see pandemic table read video.... I'm still denial over. deaths day 2,000 deaths day two weeks, another two weeks 1,000 deaths

The math checks Ohh god still salty day finale able ramp significant amount J&amp;J distribute internationally (not nationally), lot government contracts especially since worldwide production difficulties. get approval children, meet demand first. Fast tracked brand new type vaccine mRNA.. dont think enough time tell damages. #dontmesswithmydna help people say we're going back normal vaccines herd immunity uh there's still alot sick people. 7% Texans fully vaccinated. That‚Äôs close total vaccination boomers. Add people immune respiratory disorders think prediction pollyannish. 

We‚Äôre get infection surge Texas ***AGAIN***. cloth curtain fall Vaccine production ramping up, feel like US going plateau daily rate Apr. may enough doses every adult May, seen report says 60% want get it. We're track shit ton unallocated doses, bet bunch end Canada!

TBH, I'm 40 great health think I'd get chance Apr (if lucky). sudden, unexpected opportunity get vaccinated work happened early Feb today got 2nd dose. Stay hopeful! IMHO there's plenty encouraging signs ahead.  never problems lmao anxiety before, different vaccination Trump? fascinating idea!

(Seems like there've enough doses already we're well past lab rats.) finally understand reference



I watched last month lmao put another couple months could really end thing.

Yeah we've hearing year üôÑ many people getting sick can't go hospital? go hospital, full wtf supposed do? Absolutely terrible. Bolsenaro jailed. really hope countries offer help Brazil, whatever form can. July 10th! I‚Äôm hopeful us! cuz keep saying like flu not. said symptomatic Covid, four weeks first dose, ranged 57% 61% Pfizer vaccine 60% 73% AstraZeneca inoculation.


Odd article excluded AZ headline outperformed Pfizer. unfortunately correct. people screaming lockdowns next decade think Italy beating us almost daily almost year ago beginning thing!

There little evidence it'll safer.. think good even know long effective second dose?

We donot even know long it'll 2nd dose! Trials 3 months data..

Also need skip 2nd dose, need space 3-4 months.. Meanwhile vaccinate everyone monitor situation/run trials/etc decide when/if 2nd dose needed.

Israel UK smashing it. like Merck making J&amp;J vaccine.   really considering US centric article AZ probably never used US (or rarely best) honestly ask- really think people want ""lock forever""? go use someone else's product. mob still comes highlights speech misinformation. go platform take away servers payment processing domain name. 

It seem end 'if like it, use product'. Especially there's competing product. agree kept mandate. They‚Äôve beaten California far per capita! Winning!    
Deaths/1M &amp; Tot Cases/1M.    reason stuff like masking reduced capacity hours grocery stores, full lockdowns. Florida fudging numbers start. Things literally one 3 of. 'This first time test centre target attack. Christmas, vandals set fire test centre former island Urk. Windows also smashed test centres Amsterdam Urmond Limburg December.' 

Thanks God nobody hurt, would something like this? heck wrong people?   Yeah, fuck buddy. realize enough countries can‚Äòt produce vaccine right? ignore und fix area first? 
I get it, still it‚Äòs something would never support. 

I wouldn‚Äòt really call penny pinching certain eu member states thought biontech vaccines prices way high them. 
In end countries must always pay least amount money effect possible. yes may held deals back long. 

Again countries agencies rules ways approaching stuff like this, ema takes longer approve vaccines still follow procedure uk us pre approve vaccines emergency usage. Thats way us uk went eu takes regular way. blaming comment, pointing reported incessantly resulted wrong perception British public big deal. Meanwhile, continental press barely report it, effect comment pretty low.

No need resort name calling, way. lot areas it‚Äôs completely different 7-10 days ago everything still disrupted due storm. Phase III like 20,000 participants. There‚Äôs mass rollout studies Public Health Scotland PHEngland millions participants showing it‚Äôs highly effective elderly. way Texas: hold beer don‚Äôt like idea Mississippi looking good remember medical community people sub downplaying long covid saying mainly anxiety causing symptoms. wonder gaslight children way I‚Äôm less sure recommendation itself, credit done exactly RemindMe! 1 year May 8 here. Either going spectacular. Good bot Japan South-Korea many approved it? 

For exactly reason. That's tragic... hundreds doctors scientists warned us plagues dangerous, could chance take seriously. Again, unnecessary deaths worth it. I‚Äôm starting think you‚Äôre troll nobody sociopathic enough actually think Thanks Cousin Vinny flashback. That‚Äôs way could fix things. look things countries saying EU rollout shambles it‚Äôs clearly lot issues blocking vaccine exports.

Also, countries holding vaccine supply yeah, maybe same. country starving countries blocked exports here, free trade goes window would pissed country‚Äôs government continued export. end day, fucked massively; enough production, signing deals late, penny pinching, still even looking Sputnik, Sinopharm NovaVax (they ‚Äúin exploratory talks‚Äù 3 months ago),EMA taking ridiculous amount time approving (everyone high seems 100% certain J&amp;J approved weeks ago wait? much longer US/UK?  Oh dear god please start telling us every single time celebrity gets vaccine. Yet another expert seems disappointed vaccinations going well Lets jail everyone another couple years, thats good leadership xD! also using 6 months example. Scale 3 adjust death thresholds necessary. preventable deaths worth it. instead thinking it‚Äôs ok people die long Timmy go school, get upset teachers refusing go back unless they‚Äôre educated? schools restart without unnecessary deaths  know. feel like lost year life.

You did. :( Every antivaxxer's logic unique fingerprint,

A unique patchwork concepts memes cobbled together fit preexisting worldview

Antivaxxer memes seem tip iceberg True, lets wait another year... three... five... :) I'm Mississippi. never really closed. insane. many lives? Good job Texas! Schools end may it‚Äôs 2 months, generously 3, sociopath would think even 6 months education worth losing lives  Politicians: ""We stop taking refugees illegals! homeless people right here!""

Those politicians: shit right here. Well eu would also ban vaccine exports would way faster too. 
Not sure that‚Äòs something want. genius. national treasure. Well...it depends much right?

100 deaths exchange schools country reopen 6 months earlier? Easy decision, make trade. 1 million deaths? many. would rather admit they've foolish That's thought. heard anything country media outlets. really good news!     I'm offended, think stupid fact people going way confront others crossing line ""doesn't effect anyone else.""

Forgive misremembered  People still saying ‚Äòkids can‚Äôt get covid.‚Äô need many boomer celebrities daytime TV hosts possible using platforms normalize endorse vaccination they're voices many stupid people trust take advice from. care, downvote move on. Wouldnt exactly say vaccine partnership moderna. owned shares moderna, early moderna consult merck. IP moderna's. use 300 million doses November. Need now, 6 months. want tax cuts rich, giving everyone except rich pisses off. really feel this. live Florida times absolutely felt like survival fittest here. family every idiot neighbor right thing. coworkers refused wear masks. sister furloughed hospital never able get unemployment. It‚Äôs def fight here. one helping us. get opportunity get vaccine, I‚Äôm taking it. I‚Äôve right thing since February 2020 watched Florida go path completely caring. prioritized vaccine. It‚Äôs disappointing year me. Seeing selfishness others. Oh look another variant buzzword. Literally less three months anyone adult age get vaccinated guy wants cut corners Frankly probably failed route administration wrong. chose viral vector infects cells respiratory system, administration route intramsucular injection.

If I'm wrong trying oral dosing may trick, point would far behind would pointless. Neither shot bad me. gave fever sore arm it, sore arm first shot lot worse. End Covid don‚Äôt overload hospitals 

Yep, that‚Äôs exactly it. beginning thing opportunity least make Covid manageable. lockdowns used really clamp Covid attempt get control. Instead, many states (looking us FL) locked weeks. nothing else. Saw Covid numbers drop declared Covid defeated immediately opened back up. 

It wasted, nearly useless lockdown. vaccine production complete different thing vaccine procurement though?

The way read it, probably want start building infrastructure vaccine production facilities, far know none atm. probably indeed good idea, production facilities organised EU? Sounds like someone trying make sound like conflict really one. moderna pfizer's vaccines require highly specialised tools handful factories around world have.

Both JnJ Merck make viral vector vaccines, knowledge transfer merck make JnJ vaccines would much easier do. Merck producing JnJ like GM making cars ford- easy do. Asking companies make mRNA vaccines like asking ford make boeing jet. Still waiting forms, think said protection mask?! I've seen coverings strollers. Sounds like case DeSantitis.  Cases also extremely useful leading indicator disease given time. 100% time (as far know) spike cases, subsequent spike far problematic metrics (hospitalizations, deaths) followed without fail, pretty proportionally. would almost foolish keep close eye cases, maybe closest eye all, know what‚Äôs coming act it‚Äôs late. You‚Äôre ignoring asymptomatic spread.
And data looks like length illness longer - like UK variant, mildly symptomatic people spread longer. much Spanish. vas decir tu m√≠ que somos un ejemplo de cultura buen hacer, en este tema del covid (8M, ya veremos si 8Mbis, el cachondeo de Madrid, aviones, hospitales, residencias...) en muchos otros temas. Los espa√±oles por desgracia se echan la calle en masa cuando el equipo de f√∫tbol de la ciudad est√° punto de desaparecer, pero si sale una ley para joder un subsector de la poblaci√≥n (a menudo todos, pero somos demasiado burros para darnos cuenta) se nos va la energ√≠a se√±alando con el dedo gritando t√∫ m√°s que hay de lo m√≠o.

Doooo literally said parents walk around protection babies lol. another form protection people used last year wasn‚Äôt mask please let know. haven‚Äôt seen any.  Cinephiles reasonable chill. TF said putting mask baby??? scandalous part, would go? wouldn‚Äôt speaking anyone involved shit much less waste precious vacation time money witness spectacle. Wooooo Texas I'm 65 health conditions

Its okay I'll use tears bath

Its pathetic cry logic 0 responses That‚Äôs wild You‚Äôd idiotic put mask baby. It‚Äôs dangerous. It‚Äôs harder breath can‚Äôt really say much take themselves. 

You clearly don‚Äôt know you‚Äôre talking every piece advice medical community says much. think noted majority states already opened vaccinations 1. vaccine rollout greatly accelerating month, 2. Much work already done, I'm wondering actually huge change would happening states shortly anyway?

All said, personal interest policy, also prefer uniform Federal rollout patchwork state priorities, general. Ohhhh shit go called resistance variant. someone immunocompromised put second dose, however make hesitant going community shielding ended. Hopefully we'll info England fully open again, still months away. great news face face school every single teacher gets vaccinated. think should. Certain celebrities could sway certain groups people get vaccine otherwise might not. Lol Yay novavax vaccine safer? AZ vaccine also needs refrigeration. I'd hesitant comparing efficacy different standards used. look data coming UK regarding AZ vaccine absolutely fantastic terms hospitalisations proving successful Pfizer vaccine (I aware confidence intervals challenging directly compare vaccines) surge younger patients Covid-19 wards, many 30s 40s underlying health problems. Peru, doctors said patients becoming seriously ill faster, three four days first symptoms emerged

It's progressing initial symptoms serious illness faster. younger age groups. Neither good thing. Contact tracing already slow keep ahead covid19. reduces available time. movements ""Traditional"" Catholics believe popes last couple hundred years liberal. vaccine nationalism US too. Nationalistic feeling towards Pfizer (even though developed Germany) Moderna vaccines lead unnecessary hate towards AZ vaccine, even initial data released. average person starting loose due covid fatigue, imagine someone already fringe society doing? I'm worried longer persists, nuts people go. Well, not? open terms, right? I'd likely go place that's taking precautions. Let‚Äôs damn well hope so. Sucks Canada getting shafted vaccine rollout hey... guess summer going pretty much back normal vaccine not. Hopefully large enough amount people vaccinated then. Obviously best case scenario would basically everyone one summer activities aren‚Äôt overshadowed concern catching virus. I‚Äôm cautiously optimistic. Funny get downvotes telling truth... also think new mutation south africa spread less protection it. AZ anything spreading variant. 
I would take AZ vaccine shitty government (Germany) would promise get RNA booster second dose opposite. count vaccinated therefore put end line.
So wait get RNA one vaccinated AZ huge disadvantage months new variants spread regarding getting RNA vaccination. also doubt third vaccination vector work well good functional immune system. infection window stays symptoms start, meaning contagious longer. Covid problem presymptomatic spread, window shortened virus still contagious amount time symptoms begin, overall time contagiousness smaller. level passive xenophobia Spanish culture matter well baffles me. guess even Spanish.

No Spanish ignorant stupid country. guess xenophobic bashing give upvotes. nice leader charge? Americans epitome selfish thinking. simply don‚Äôt care someone gets sick due selfishness long ‚Äòfreedom‚Äô. Things like courtesy concern fellow man alien concept us.

But say masks don‚Äôt work pure bs. No, course not. want things fine without worry anything. Yes, know theres always type threat, normal threats (cold, flu, etc) there‚Äôs this, entirely different story. yes, vaccinate population.

I'm gap two probably shrink, Pfizer probably coming ahead - Pfizer likely better seniors trials extended dosing regime might also improve result due viral vector. I'm confident enough say without lot data. No. 0.5% state tested positive July 1. Since October 1, 0.25% infections reinfections (approximate) period. would put 50%, probably far lower bound (using 3-month gap separate groups).

You still grasp rare we'd expect double-testing even reinfections common. Everything fine.Turn TV go outside. Yes, statewide mandate, plenty counties mandates, live one them. 

If mad state-enforced mandate, take DeSantis, me.

Thats 5% small example. remaining 95% well mannered gentlemen.
Just experiences bad mean say ""Indians"" perverts. mean indians least majority Indians are. seen much Indians ever see. assure kind people exist, minority. Wait, she‚Äôs 15? looks 4. Ok stock pushing moon again? year later started happening. going SUCK, scalpers hoard tickets passes. I'm looking forward next year states, bet housing market crash. bet investors going flee commercial real-estate (due many businesses companies walking away leases) move right residential real-estate. They'll buy properties rent back people priced houses. don‚Äôt get there‚Äôs also massive **massive** difference June.

Now isn‚Äôt time go back normal. 

But weeks everyone high risk chance vaccinated. That‚Äôs plenty reasonable time reopen. lost 2 members family, every doctor family sick quarantined 2 weeks. 

Definitely conspiracy theory. I‚Äôm NJ, boat you. think we‚Äôll okay. Vaccines ramping things getting worse hopefully vaccinations kick weeks speed decline again. I‚Äôve read didn‚Äôt large spike states winter we‚Äôre coming slowly Right. serious endogeneity states worse outbreaks likely implement mask mandates response. talkng mouthfull one Hexanitrohexaazaisowurtzitane. Cause nitro cages got RUNNIN! fill mask popcorn, like horse feed bag Agreed, good news around can't cake eat though. Many people want full face face classes. Fine, reasonable ask teachers get vaccinated then, especially 1/3 teacher population 50. Considering Canada struggling vaccinate anyone right now, limiting 65's plenty data worldwide showing safe extremely effective going cost lives. I'm sure 65's die covid feel safe knowing given AZ vaccine. US richest enjoys near total hegemony. single country could get done, besides US. Also, live US that's focus criticism. wealthy nations shit, too, wealth power they're favored US. Except course, China Russia, donated vaccines poorer countries. neat say majority wealthy nations support TRIPS, kind ignores make high percentage world's population 100 ""developing"" countries oppose it. Look, believe IP laws say that. Quit making excuses actions objectively bad vast majority humans. AstraZeneca expected approved well late March/April US? vaccine clinic worked problem wasn‚Äôt necessarily lack vaccines 65+ fact many people older age ranges quite literally can‚Äôt operate email online portals sign vaccine. crazy many old people came asking help sign email. opened later stages sooner I‚Äôm confident older crowd wouldn‚Äôt gotten shots people age would easily gotten appointments we‚Äôre technologically date. would surely help colds flus incubated schools daycares. love *catches* rye Close 1.3 Million Cases 1.1 Million Cured.

Not really screwed.  casually dismissing 1.4 billion people sex pests

Well, 700 million. Cases Poland rise too... unlucky reckless probably type immunity among group, elderly well along getting vaccinated, folks using precautions continue get shots.

The terrible loss life, many people gone be, forgotten. I've lost neighbors, friends lost family.

But looking like ultimately make through. Hope learn something nation world this. 

Bipartisan international effort made prevent something magnitude happening again. 

 can't ""go back sleep"". Oh, safe sure. think better understanding past ‚Äî help us navigate future. Like, 1920s, rise authoritarian movements need stomped ‚Äî turn authoritarian governments 1930s.  LMAO irony. Like said, best luck really wish well. maybe... hear out...they protected COVID-19!!! Yup. I‚Äôve said Fauci/Biden started talking hopefully normal Christmas masks 2022, going backfire spectacularly. stuck 100 day plan...100 days sort right ship...would brought us April 30th find indians creepy towards women? want point many teachers teaching person since August Different bishop. Clearly there's trend here... hope so! Sorry pessimism. want see family people gotten upset week getting vaccine since kinda snuck phase. shitty week. hope vaccine distribution process state gets together anyone wants actually get may. see posts basically prematurely celebrating like wonder get info getting vaccine eradicates COVID? 

Don‚Äôt get wrong I‚Äôm excited get vaccinated too, CDC pretty much dr worth weight already said mask wearing still need enforced large gatherings still unsafe.

The vaccine makes less likely get fatal case COVID, immune catching it. still variants hope aren‚Äôt worse.

This virus isn‚Äôt going away year stuck needles arms. People travel mean it‚Äôs even likely variants pop coming year.

I think see another big wave months. Cities like NYC opening even though it‚Äôs near safe fraction population getting vaccinated.

So many people full blown zero fucks since Thanksgiving see sign everything fine stop adhering sort safety. ones never going get vaccine ones never wear masks still biggest vectors.

As someone lives NYC, way you‚Äôre convincing summer ‚Äúnormal‚Äù everyone wants get back here. People fucking desperate forget COVID take vaccine kind miracle - it‚Äôs still mindful enough people going get spread still happen.

There way hell I‚Äôm going anywhere outside place without N95 mask foreseeable future even I‚Äôm vaccinated. think makes stores workplaces want hold line fight people employees receive abuse. here, there's enough room paths city running streets would dangerous. know bipartisan discourse? read sad story khamzat chimaev saying bad there. Stay Home can. Stay safe hope so. Since vaccination necessarily prevents catching virus itself, worried long covid might still problem getting vaccine. seems little awarness/ media coverage long covid. vaccine manufacturers approved publishing interim phase 3. Unless count russian Chinese vaccines. know why. blaming everything producers really fly anymore, son. problems fuck ups European governments well documented point. UK stats showed closed everything else kept schools open, schools began drive pandemic. pretty much directly contradicts theory. Well played, India! Get everyone vaccinated re-open world. Curve flattening, flattened. lost 500k lives US failed. However, states struggling give enough appointments AstraZeneca since one age 65

It kind stupid first place, blows mind restriction *still* lifted much real world data proves pointless good days now, that's problem that's undermining whole vaccine program. Ultimately, seems like there's zero sense urgency anything. study 15 people. even ‚ÄúHowever, follow-up visit individuals received second dose (given three weeks), able neutralise virus.‚Äù  honestly there's multiple sources schools high risk locations. see need teachers jumped front others clear they're higher risk anyone Massachusetts explicitly ID requirements reason. eligibility constraints enforced honour system.

I think makes lot sense given long term goals. Idiots upset though. Georgia supposed ‚Äúexperiment human sacrifice‚Äù last year. yet are, lol. It‚Äôs like people disappointed wasn‚Äôt big Hollywood doomsday promised.  There's South Africa vaccine trials results though. margin error, still pretty solid evidence B1351 strain. Mody evil evil change anything vaccine. Chinese vaccines Sputnik. last show went Black Label Society last NAMM show. Everyone keeps asking I'm careful. There's fucking way I'm getting sick dying Zach Wylde last dude saw stage. Fuck that. Positivity Rate: said lot subs positivity rate go time people vaccinated require testing.

Appreciate typing glad took time read morning. NY positivity gone smidge. realize, though, less tests happening. NY still testing TON people, days positivity rate jumps bit, there's less tests. 

My thought process majority people getting tested symptoms‚Äîespecially holidays, nowhere go right second. makes much sense. 2008 bad derivatives market. Housing likely correct, near 2008 levels likely offset somewhat inflation pressure ton new money economy. Asking phase 3 efficacy results != Modi evil  could've 2020 already. Trump president  Jesus, they're not. virus killed half million Americans left many long term damage. Masks worse death disease. bet one single study show masks harm kids psychologically interfere development can't see someone's mouth. I'm sure find pop-psy article says could happen, nothing outside editorials. 

And again, zero reason think vaccines unsafe. development seems rapid mRNA vaccines 30 years development now, able test easily since pandemic going easy run effective studies. scared want, stop putting misinformation supported anything baseless fear. every vaccines announced thier interim data like double standards? also shortage N95 respirators face masks among health care workers quickly overwhelmed Covid-19 patients. medical workers ended using plastic office report covers ordinary items makeshift, often substandard face masks working closely Covid-19 covid ‚Äúairborne‚Äù.

Alright, spread water droplets, linger air hours. Looks like Burnol stock empty :) death doesn‚Äôt matter. /s

But real, people seem worried COVID deaths deaths lockdowns lost businesses Lol stimmy? I‚Äôll take vaxxy tho couldn‚Äôt imagine go life much misery do.  University Michigan banning 375 students taken required COVID-19 tests entering non-residential buildings campus, school announced Wednesday morning. undergraduate students Mcards, scan enter buildings, deactivated received emails Tuesday telling move, university said multiple attempts reach means students can't go buildings housing classes, laboratories even social activities. vast majority classes offered semester virtual. known exactly many students actually campus using buildings. ‚ÄúThey got me,‚Äù Covid said American's vaccine effort. ""That fucking America boomed me.""

Covid added, ‚ÄúTheir good,‚Äù repeating four times.

Covid said wanted add America list countries it'll avoid summer. GTFO science-based logic!! point time probably best allow anyone Brasil. Yes know spread better contain slow version spreading even world wide. still think rest world shut travel Wuhan beginning could localized lot less severe was. Saw early reports long covid gotten vaccine seen effects start get better. seems helping people already long covid, greatly reduce right prevent it.  Considering death rate US much different European countries, also less damage economy, would give U.S. ""F"". point Covid, something else. Millions die flu year, appreciable number common cold. kept year round, worry sorts diseases.

I say, really nice get single cold past year. get really annoyed seeing people public coughing storm feel go work, class, etc. Austin. far we‚Äôre concerned nothing changed we‚Äôll keep going like following safety guidelines. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

""Just like Flu"" ass... Care explain better? It‚Äôs fact whole EU lagging behind basically scammed vaccine manufacturers refused give doses paid for. 
Or think ‚Äúsocialist-populist propaganda‚Äù? Lol. watched bunch virtual panels last year's SDCC, fun. Hours upon hours content. Nothing compare in-person experience, still something. 

Shit job marketing though. lot people seemed know offered all. hope way people tune year, welcome people back real 2022. I‚Äôm teacher apparently essential worker. I‚Äôve person teaching since October. work teens disabilities could harmed get Covid me- district prioritizing special education teachers, luckily. society wants continually shit online schooling micromanage every single thing teachers pandemic...give us vaccine. 

In opinion, it‚Äôs bad thing person gets vaccine, even deem ‚Äúless worthy.‚Äù It‚Äôs foolish. We‚Äôre hitting 2m doses day right now. People can‚Äôt fucking wait end month it‚Äôll 10x safer üôÑ get trying here, really need stop using ""being gay"" attempt character assassination. help anybody. definitely sucks (to put mildly) one folks kicked back line, especially can't work home, good sick leave health insurance (if any), etc. Honestly want someone settle strategy, strategy, stick it. feels like third major evolution vaccination guidelines three months. Johnson Johnson vaccine might effective two months. Amazing true. Cool, free like... wait, responding person responded you
I think may thought responding comment? get caught using Alt?  way knowing would apply? Welcome Texas rules made deaths don‚Äôt matter. gonna great summer typically get snow every 10 years

We get snow every 10 years Texas. part country gets snow couple/few times year. also freezing temps, record heat, etc. power grid crappy well decade haven‚Äôt done sh-t it. quickly vaccine absorb muscle someone gets shot? would think would pretty instantaneous, no? asking vaccine would immediately start working, would absorb process would start fairly quick? Yeah saw news right sadly enough. Plus there‚Äôs sketchy workplace culture don‚Äôt love including sexual harassment health code violations That‚Äôs lot confidence lot speculation. lift allow people choose, doesn‚Äôt say don‚Äôt Lol, you‚Äôre emotional, relax man. Italian issues EU based populist base, 35% vaccines fridge. AZ runs rougly 15% usage.

Italians really stop following socialist-populist propaganda anti-eu, luckily current government better seems like it. genuinely can't imagine anyone would feel nostalgic bittersweet, or, frankly, anything angry sad regards coming one year anniversary shutdown. hit 'certain' age, know someone negatively impacted vaccine medicine. Cipro, 6 months returned normal friends Achilles tendon snapped limps forever even surgery.

My sisters friend died Guillain-Barre syndrome, never issue flu shot prior. years flu shot completely ineffective well employer pumping like free chocolates everyone took them.

A healthy dose skepticism never bad thing. Blind faith is.  

I misdiagnosed 8 years 30 different things, given medicines etc turned thyroid related.  

People like ones watching listening vaccine see take it. I'm fence right whereas two months prior way how.  see doctors forced cattle people out. Ive antibiotics prescribed pharmacist caught something Im allergic to, one (Cipro) really number me.  

So Im hopeful herd immunity preclude getting vaccinated, hopeful due diligence various vaccines available pick right one eventually get it. Yes dropped ball failing force power plants winterize. said, nothing could reasonably done would fully prepared since nobody really expects something like happen last time happened 1949 capitalism kicked sold cost price?

It opened sourced fear second rate production methods used resulting supply untrustworthy vaccines would fuel anti vaxers.  wild me. makes sense kind ritual separate home work, actually going far go entire commute??? guess commute really short makes sense. Personally mine 45 minutes long means get hour half free time every day, spending time trying get motion sickness squeezed strangers crowded bus. They'll drag back office kicking screaming. course does. fact schools currently exist provide function. debate fix this, immediate fix/stop-gap get kids back school ASAP. can't get re-do years. Good them..Caring Texas Virginia must really reporting awhile, 383 deaths listed Worldometers today. Higher thread someone linked Standard Ebooks looks super cool bunch free literature download Good fucking lord fair, Texas various extreme weather events past years warned multiple times past decade power grid unstable needed something it. 3 failures usually efficacy vs placebo effect (source), safety issues correct misinformation.**

This.

God hate people learn one two facts think know everything become immune new knowledge. Feel free go Texas-based media's website. Certainly mask order today top story, look 2nd, 3rd, 4th. Nothing power outages. news released push story headlines, previous headlines anything power outages? biggest story Texas past couple days car crash killed dozen people. ridiculous is, likely Abbott ended mask mandate push story headlines. Exactly. need whatsoever approve covaxin prior phase 3 trials finishing. number approved vaccines manufacturing capacity bottleneck. idea India desperately get approved legitimate public health concerns hold. can't repeated often enough. likes Pfizer want cheap effective vaccine cornering market, try malign Sputnik AstraZeneca. worth, I'd willing take any, including Sputnik Sinovac, really give toss whether covid puts bed couple days strikes mild cold - long end hospital, that's good enough me. good enough society, well. Take sympathetic Floridian every day marvels idiots state: Thank sense compared everyone around leadership.  Texas‚Äôs power grid failed millions lost power water due it. would believe lot if, last time people told ""Hold two three weeks!"", stretched year far.

I every reason suspect people who're telling safe saying thing next month, month that. figure safety - lot safer last month, someone says thinks safe enough now, can't really object. work force difference right work states equal opportunity states.   Makes sense considering even whole state much population dense texas. find funny people compare states west south northeastern states people started populating 500 years ago.  people UK made sterner stuff mainland?

If British French probably know already, stereotype French nation hypochondriacs British like black knight Monty Python Holy Grail (saying ""it's scratch"" leg gets cut off).

imo there's little bit truth that, part, seeing side-effects Europe probably combination biased reporting nocebo effect (people perceiving side-effects they're told vaccine bad). No. Ding that. Stunned Topol did, Ding go there.

Guaranteed.

His 15 minutes depends that. June hits hard say ‚Äújust months‚Äù news? I‚Äôm sure lot places going still that. Except Sweden adding new restrictions constantly.

There's reason slip now. really loves scaring shit people reason.  Canadians could get vaccinated earlier planned National Advisory Committee Immunization (NACI) agrees adjust recommended interval first second vaccine doses ‚Äî change provinces, notably B.C.

This shipping Pfizer normal temperatures kicker. First-dose-first give ton protection, hopefully.

[Health Canada allows flexible storage transportation conditions Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 study finds 80 per cent efficacy one dose COVID-19 depends area, west hollywood enforcing outdoor mask mandate far remember knew true past *did* apply. 

Science, default, builds upon past discoveries. 

Caution warranted, many media fellow Redditors threw proverbial baby bath water. That's kind adorable. wait two weeks. see. same, I'm going keep wearing mask socially-distancing I'm idiot. problem UK atleast allow vaccinated people since everyone UK offered vaccine end July although may reach target even looking current rate vaccinations. Maybe im wrong comments seem like organized effort normalize reopening.

 Lots repeat comments people defending reopening. Attacking feel foolish. interesting see ever get data differences immune response variants people vaccinated whole, inactivated virus antigen compared vaccines target spike protein. understanding variant mutations focused around spike protein perhaps inactivated virus might lose less effectiveness mutations? Good see somewhere still enforcing rules. sayy Florida though? I'm confused. read article media saying ""T-cell responses vaccinated previously infected coronavirus largely unaffected key variants."" known media. seems widely reported. thinking September everyone wants vaccinated access. really want wrong. far region 1 month behind initial projections next estimate isn‚Äôt looking good either guy knows score lol, fuck yeah! actually fairly common practice many parts Asia they've deal various respiratory diseases. Many people either wear one winter months caution, especially sick. actually bad practice adopt, especially low cost. 

That said, mandated. something recommended. sit back watch spikes cases deaths. interesting see international community praising USA vaccine rollout last weeks, getting pretty much dumped year them. 

Just goes show whole thing nuanced people realize, anybody making bold/hard claims (we lock like New Zealand! etc.) baselessly running mouth.  Sorry dumb question, I'm trouble finding straight answer myself. 

Does anyone good sources effective Pfizer vaccine preventing person actually contracting virus? keep finding information effective preventing symptoms. possible conclusive data whether vaccine actually prevents infections? 'May'.

&amp;#x200B;

Fuck weasel-y, spineless bullshit speech. That's 'WILL' kind scenario. 65% still good (better flu vaccine) [100% effective hospitalizations one dose makes significantly easier get people immunized quickly well. completely get people might want opt Moderna Pfizer, I'm happy get J&amp;J vaccine (I'm low risk individual). expected.

Sadly scaremongering every new variant comes along easy way drive clicks. advising governors? giving info good idea? look mirror ok see? sleep night? look family members face think everything protect them? Governor Abbot governor Reeves must moral conscious. 
 
So many people died many will, stupid proud wear mask. It‚Äôs shame. educational system failed us, producing leaders intellectually unfit serve.  biggest clubs miami still closed though  Let people make decisions safety like since dawn time.

We ended wedding 30ish people immediate family friends. Ironically day heard 250+ people wedding happening far ours. Long story short original wedding going 300+ people huge hassle. much we'd rather pandemic happen all, us good excuse allowed us small wedding really wanted without anyone getting butthurt.

I'm super happy everyone finally getting weddings this, I'm sure next years plenty awesome weddings go to. neighbor exact thing. Never opportunity jumped it. way bet would, guarantee you‚Äôre wrong COVID‚Äôs impact able change world. 9/11 changing world. flights stressful? Ok‚Ä¶. change work? change socialize? change shop, shop apartments, schedule appointments, order food. you‚Ä¶.

Can see many things COVID affected? School, work, entertainment, time, exercise, every. Single.

We could never pull something like Korea, Japan New Zealand start pandemic whilst people follow rules significant enough amount follow them.

We're never going get rid covid globally manage vaccines instead praying; know coming. Lifting mask mandate stupid idea paid people's lives.  don‚Äôt go movies much even times go I‚Äôll happily pay overpriced buttery popcorn.

Until cases deaths surge again. exactly doing.

People age 85 525 times likely die covid-19 people 18-29. People 50-64 26 times likely die people age 18-29.

People 18-29 15 times likely die children 5-17. Age important risk factor disease, everything else pales British PM gambling without much evidence,

You mean MHRA providing regulatory approval considering evidence four clinical trials covering 24,000 people? understand that. point I'll certainly side ""open now"" don‚Äôt know anyone else I‚Äôm one shot one go weeks. Hopefully 4th July get fuckin fun celebrate!!! 

Getting married October hoping everything good go then. families deserve something look forward to.

I wish everyone happiness health! We‚Äôre almost  cannot think apples-to-oranges comparison comparing Texas Hawaii.

Man can't wait see band live again. Midwest cold really unable even sit outside anywhere, last time saw live music sort Sept/Oct wonderful thing know may soon possible again. ""Scariants""

I'm gonna use that. That's clever. Yeah, let's follow Texas's lead watch cases deaths skyrocket. really need spell out? Vaccinating grocery store employees removes considerable risk cashiers returning work general public. turn makes in-person shopping much safe environment, allowing people safely buy food.

Nope... fucking frustrating. I'm gonna make appointment anyway see take eventually lol cause wtf arizona. Also, happy cake day! maybe.. maybe not, maybe one lucky ones get long term covid people would likely great chance dying car way movies, instead COVID. relieving encouraging. Probably latest EU smear tactic, based past behaviour. market drive whether right not. 

The market determine whether decisions make cost effective them. slaves cost effective. Child labour cost effective. Denying insurance claims expensive patients cost effective. Creating convoluted insurance policies reveal shortcomings late cost effective. Etc ad infinitum. 

More pointedly, people making decisions safety, making decisions safety people know. insufficient incentive motivate enough (read: ALL) people right thing scenario, hence need government step in. 

&amp;#x200B;

IMHO logically sound argument is: ""This virus bad enough, let weak die"". feel it‚Äôs domino effect. one governor lifts mandates, eventually states follow suit. Literally none contradicts anything said. country always divided. matter President is. think shut 3-4 weeks near completely sake economy way back March-April last year. Otherwise, see *this* ending, Covid-19 disease poverty can't afford work, go work, take time vaccine, web browser go make appointment, get appointment general, educated enough know vaccine works, get disease, take chances dying immunity possible long term consequences. 

I offering bait. numbers work. end closing borders anything Countries fully vaccinated, otherwise eradicated virus, begins whole new kind diplomacy, cold war depending percentages there. normal go back to, whole new world, matter what. pull blatant obvious bullshit like this, Kansas mask study, Redfield equating mask vaccines wonder people dont trust guidance...goddamn...is absolutely zero self awareness? agree sentiment remark.  Insulting people helpful. protection cloth masks provide protection people breathing out. everyone else wearing masks, wearing one does't provide much protection.

If high risk kids, going need step N95 KN95 masks bring shit home them.  might last months whenever vaccines widely available. Mandate theater obviously. However, gone theaters two reasons. want wear mask 2 hours think risk worth it. get vaccinated going anywhere requires wear mask extended period time especially theater. I'll happy give business require it. I'm also young healthy LA REALLY HOPE RIGHT!! would anyone want vaccine that‚Äôll eventually utterly useless months?

So get disease literally ravaging almost everywhere planet right now?

So die get sick?

So get lockdown?

So protected getting new variant, wont spread people fucking vaccinated? 10.6 million doses already shipped week. That's happens rule something out.   recall Fauci said that. Also, CDC set establish guidelines vaccinated. reading far, pushing vaccinated people gatherings unmasked vaccinated people. feel Texas jumping gun. Let everyone equal access vaccines normalcy return soon after. 

[unmasked gatherings fully vaccinated think managing get pandemic accomplishment itself, fret achieving goals lockdown. feel like 90% people know stressed / depressed really anything productive - many us went boat. think got mental health still somewhat intact, enough victory worry much things feel ""supposed do"" daily comment occasionally updated, totally sharing people like parents Great meant 2 dose vaccines. That's ok. mandate nobody require masks...duh Yes, said Johnson pressured MHRA authorise naive think otherwise. losing track said. comfortable thought people might die unnecessarily vaccine misinformation spreading? understanding, article specifically talking covid deaths only. Doesn‚Äôt look like that‚Äôs plan get actual normal? Also article‚Äôs May last year, pre-vaccines Exactly. want maskless people business hang sign says ""no mask=fuckoff""  CDC going dragged kicking screaming 2021 sheer American public. People survive pandemic naturally?? Whodathunk. Humidity, wind, sunlight, masks, time-limited exposure. 

People aren‚Äôt getting covid five minutes grocery store. getting hanging seven friends several hours inside. appears so.

From I've read since arrived, unlikely silver bullet reset. need open greater ever been.

The impacts shut downs compound, people can't another ""actually safe yet _____"" hit May June.

The point can't keep seeing shut downs social distancing answer here, people access vaccine still high likelihood lot people get vaccine, virus still spreading around bunch reasons....that mean keep locking down.

What seeing vaccine access end point matter what. We're going start mitigation measures virus still spreads....we can't months end longer. CDC Update today: Shots Administered: 78,631,601

A novel SARS-CoV-2 variant, VOC 202012/01 (lineage B.1.1.7), emerged southeast England November 2020 rapidly spreading toward fixation. Using variety statistical dynamic modelling approaches, estimate variant 43‚Äì90% (range 95% credible intervals 38‚Äì130%) higher reproduction number preexisting variants. fitted two-strain dynamic transmission model shows VOC 202012/01 lead large resurgences COVID-19 cases. Without stringent control measures, including limited closure educational institutions greatly accelerated vaccine roll-out, COVID-19 hospitalisations deaths across England 2021 exceed 2020. Concerningly, VOC 202012/01 spread globally exhibits similar transmission increase (59‚Äì74%) Denmark, Switzerland, United States. contributing far less people vaccinated

Exactly reason phased/slow reopening good idea. \~two months, adults US vaccinated. People like COVID bad first place. reason it'll get bad again. say, data recent weeks new variants South Africa Brazil undercut optimism. believe SARS-CoV-2 remain us endemic virus, continuing circulate communities, likely cause significant burden illness death years result, scientists said, people could expect continue take measures routine mask-wearing avoiding crowded places COVID-19 surges, especially people high vaccination, ""I still would want wear mask variant there,"" Dr. Anthony Fauci, chief medical advisor U.S. President Joe Biden, said interview. ""All need one little flick variant (sparking) another surge, goes prediction"" life gets back normal.

This article ingredients foment category 5 shitstorm sub. 

For main takeaway still: ""getting many people vaccinated possible still answer path forward December 1 January 1,"" Crotty said, ""but expected outcome same.""

Variants bad, virus gets lucky one variants could really spell trouble terms evading vaccine. scientists seem predicting long term game whack-a-mole variants emerging vaccines crafted fight them. new ""expected outcome"". imperative remove restrictions relax vaccinate many people possible. We're making harder long run. Well they‚Äôre patient, they‚Äôll sure hell get money money friends take seriously maybe long term affect bottom line good way might late. almost bought JETS (airline ETF) March wussed out. coworkers mentioned well it. Dolly Parton 100% pure class. suggesting Texas see rise cases all-time high? They've already filed bankruptcy assertion untrue. still committed protecting employees guests. businesses free let enter voluntarily unvaccinated. individual freedoms

""Let idiot help spread virus without caring affected."" Professor here. justifying behavior I'm teaching everything person semester request think online education crock sh-t, provide explanation... lot schools cannot afford bunch student body defer. need tuition fees. mind guess. mean US great job vaccine rollout trying imply they‚Äôve done even comparable job NZ laughable. case all? restrictions inherently hurt bottom line past year. type comment second time first one got removed? 

Just 40%-50% cases asymptomatic mean ones spreading it. virus transfers respitory droplets. means someone coughing sneezing unlikely spread virus. someone without symptoms spread virus would literally walk right someone cough spit them. haven‚Äôt luck. called two Walgreens said aren‚Äôt wait list. called small hometown pharmacy aren‚Äôt one either apparently. sounds like making up. data older people end December. I‚Äôm agreeing lose lives you‚Äôre pessimistic. Political situations change, death can‚Äôt. Holy shit. pretty mind blowing opening read. I‚Äôve pondered points last year, never (dare say logical?) conclusions article takes to. expecting another anti-lockdown muh freedoms article long line those, isn‚Äôt that. interesting. Lots think hope decision makers thinking stuff. feel little queasy too.  maybe logic flawed?

Careful, getting dangerously close self awareness. missing best years life

Yeah, wonder people say things like that.

I STEM. 8 o'clock classes every day. Labs ran 9 night even later. Hours studying. pressure exams.

Plus that's learned live without phone, A/C heat learned bake bread afford buy it.

Part time jobs. Money. Money. Money. school constantly nickle diming, nickles dimes. Student loans. best years life,

Far it. really one thing good years nothing university experience. told psychosomatic üôÑ Total dont mean jack tho, per capita still better uk Italy, line developed nations.   Damn. Mississippi Texas. good popcorn stuff right here. happens numbers explode like whole Florida situation? Everyone yelling FLORIDA KILL EVERYONE! said fuck summer. looking numbers worst national trends. feel like one ever addresses that. Texas Mississippi performs way, there's gonna questions need answering. 


But think worst part CDC / Fauci current vaccine messaging. someone rushed get vaccinated, remember promises vaccine finish line. start normal, travel vaccinated. even talking vaccination passports. 


But like communicating despite vaccine expect continue socially distance, keep limits gatherings well keeping certain industries close. People fed saying fuck point. Lets open vaccines rolling see happens. Theyre losing public point. live Mississippi. continue wear mask. Yeah, agree. think probably couple weeks soon, think it'll change numbers much.

If went 100% mask, social distancing, restaurant capacity compliance 0%, I'm sure difference would far noticeable. thing is, number people taking seriously whole time still finding ways around said think much change Austin Houston)

Or Dallas. assumed people would able pick sarcasm without /s reminded Reddit. bad there's mask mandate, virus proliferate? Even without vaccines, masks social distancing cut numbers drastically. people wearing masks? Florida fudging numbers big time. can't hide forever, open records laws good. dust settled, media organization solid investigative journalism wing like Tampa Bay Times going publish real numbers.

Edit: Covid 19 deaths ""[17% 58% higher published death last June. true toll liable many thousands cases letting on. called ""the holidays."" Every state's cases rose around time. alleged goal controlling pandemic taking drastic measures reduce hospitalizations level medical system could cope. vaccines far appear almost eliminate hospitalizations even people get sick. first time ever gotten flu (at least remember) first time I‚Äôd actually fever probably since kid. don‚Äôt get sick often completely knocked ass. fever bad, remember couch covered mountain blankets trying watch tv mind going consciousness felt like. siblings (and dad) husbands siblings parents oddly enough, none husbands family got sick. wives family. strange! So, one. paper sequence virus know variants part study.

Two, actually read it?

"" participants received two standard doses, efficacy primary symptomatic COVID-19 consistent UK (60¬∑3% efficacy) Brazil (64¬∑2% efficacy), indicating results generalisable across two diverse settings different timings booster dose (with participants UK receiving booster dose 12 weeks first dose participants Brazil receiving second dose within 6 weeks first).

I‚Äôm glad live country considers policies like strict scrutiny standard - meaning, government show law policy invasive degree justified actually necessary meet compelling government interest. evidence shows masks, distancing, imposed quarantines work effectively reduce spread would render policy illegal since methods accomplish ultimate goal reducing transmission.

Let‚Äôs check sub tomorrow doom gloom variants. frequent commenters ‚ÄòI‚Äôm watching new Antarctic variant see evades vaccine‚Äô. Guarantee myth super-variants , never made much sense, continue.

I also guarantee certain public health officials continue repeat scare tactics regarding variants well. Someone‚Äôs gonna get screwed decision make. think ideally states would reserve least vaccines significant comorbidities otherwise moving forward plan, it‚Äôs worst decision. state floating around splitting ‚Äúgeneral public‚Äù couple age groups. think we‚Äôll least 25-30% population done anyway, we‚Äôll see goes. Phase 3 failures usually efficacy vs placebo effect safety issues correct misinformation.

Think it, phase 3 trials involve thousands people general public, would allow happen know would already cause significant health effects. rigorious phase 1 2 trials.

Not discount important phase 3 is, cases may beneficial high risk individuals (i.e. healthcare works) get unknown efficacy vaccine rather exposed COVID sometimes subpar protective equipment die. What‚Äôs safe versus need keep aren‚Äôt riots outside Walgreens two different things.  may said knew people could transmit virus showing symptoms without symptoms all. contagious sick, quarantining contact tracing might enough quell saying anything know fact. know, mention share know. Public Health 101.

That's impossible standard meet anyone versed science. would say nothing, since science give people 100% certainty. Public health officials obviously can't say nothing, make recommendations best ability based data time

We also hold anyone else standard. public's distrust public health officials public health officials constantly lying public straight line.

Ok bud. lot country still trusts Fauci part. He's willing admit wrong why. He's willing admit data changes. That's need public health officials get that, yeah. wish Canada others honest motivations. ""we made huge medical breakthrough! :) "" rather ""everything fucked, logistics fucked, supplies fucked, best bad solution.""

Honesty matters. pretty ridiculous, anyone wants vaccine able outdoors. seems vocal ones often extreme goes sides. analysis preclude confounding variables all. I'm assuming can't control see evidence override rest, lets concentrate outputs.

You've admitted can't quantify yet still want say, despite outcomes, JB ""well."" 

Despite poorly.

The facts care feelings.  near 529,536? general idea here, working Adjacent role prioritized despite required on-site. Thankfully general public doesn‚Äôt make feel lot better online education crock sh-t

Does hurt stuck 80s? current generation seeing in-person lecture actual crock shit. Okay, good know! I'll checking throughout day case!  skimmed decided couldn‚Äôt possibly worth reading based questions Shutting travel early last year could probably avoided mess countries found argument mask mandates this: government power make us wear certain attire. argument getting rid seatbelts, speed limits, etc. Lol oh man.

People suck. 

I appreciated comment. Pray don‚Äôt alter further.  Would even China Russia reluctant business? like might dead end spring.

This people dooming glooming. lot people still severely misinformed things work believe small portion people vaccinated enough make end, reality, ""go back normal"" soon, create perfect storm viral mutation overcomes vaccination, we're back square one.

The virus still get body vaccinated, vaccine gives anti-bodies head start fight allows body react faster virus. people vaccine spend time around people unvaccinated getting sick spreading it, chance vaccine thwarting virus goes exponentially. know chance begin with.

*It over, till over.*

*There thing response exponential threat.*     big hope also frees doses rest world well. hammer scourge everywhere. appeals too, yes - feel fully safe get shots close 3 weeks apart possible. :) gap means everyone so-so protection, fully safe till October - assuming second shot even works booster then. (As opposed new course 2 shots 3 weeks apart.)

I might actually fly States get shots endgame Canada means waiting till October...      likely folks wearing masks anyways even mandate, wont change anything folks wearing mask continue so. also businesses continue enforce masks.  next 10 days indicate whether Osterholm hurricane develops not. that, several businesses follow Dallas area (both big corporations smaller) said continue enforce masks majority bar vaccinated risk rather low point. even unlucky people get likely minor symptoms Well, looking University Michigan, employ 29 000 people Ann Arbor campus. guess could become infected. Also, 18-22 year olds ""no risk"". lower risk serious disease death. mean still flight instructor certification, education right? Bam. 

Honestly though, personally willing cut line, I‚Äôd rather give elderly. Looks like don‚Äôt even say matter, though, what‚Äôs done done. Henceforth specified covid longer issue COVID without vaccine vs flu vaccine. Good confirmed, shouldn‚Äôt really major concern. Times live in, media driven fear, public health officials quite understanding words caution get reinterpreted words doom led idea ever serious concern. law practically meaningless. always scared companies make mandates. Hopefully, fatigued people take wallets shops free. Unfortunately, scared people fear going shops majority going free shops, shift.

What business licensing? Accessibility medical exempt? really hope stupidity contagious argument dumbest bullshit I‚Äôve ever seen. Imagine pretending understand virus spreads one year global viral pandemic let Payless ShoeSource without piece cloth face months early. No. directly conflicts news variants data    think point got live life, otherwise what's point? WTF going there? live fairly close Czech border Germany I'm worried high number cases spread Germany. According RKI map seems already is.

Are people social distancing all? still able travel getting tested instead. Fauci likely said US mass producing vaccines one first countries fully vaxxed. 

Almost country luxury. problem happened beginning. bank teller see's someone walk mask press button right away instead waiting till person announces it. That‚Äôs unrealistic all. you‚Äôre worried Covid restrictions, waiting may understandable. hope it‚Äôs fun time! Emergency use authorization. approved widespread use US, pandemic emergency.

It's important distinction. Also depends state live in. Like Georgia might behind likely scrap tiers sooner rather later. live CA making good progress probably decide keep age based tiers long can, postponing date free-for-all. thats good deal. Everyone wins going complicate things much businesses customers. least MS, cities enforce stricter mandates state, unfortunately many people understand believes state trumps local law situations. 

So businesses thought anti-maskers bad before.... Crossing fingers mean, news kind fell cycle announcement, trying distract, waited bit long... don‚Äôt live dorms, there‚Äôs nothing University really do. People still congregating around off-campus housing, 90% students pretty much non-freshmen live year dorms ‚Äúde-densified‚Äù I‚Äôm scared all, could see concern possibility continuing spread therefore mutating more, apposed reaching heard immunity like places certain vaccines.

I think really obvious, doesn‚Äôt take much imagination understand difference making disease safer vs making disease scarce. dedicated people understand vaccinations work. CDC's guidelines people vaccinated exception rules **other** vaccinated people. areas, need wear mask, socially distance gather.

If *soon* mean 2022? Maybe dead. largely depends keep states like Texas tripping everyone right finish line. one award post. disappointing. Depends feel. pain much running makes pain worse yh go ahead Requiring positive thinking data driven reasoning one reasons coronavirus pandemic bungled US killed hundreds thousands needed to. people believe both, yes.

I find interesting reading comments ""inefficiency"" rollout means percentage received vaccines producer vs administered vaccines. account societal people get vaccinated. related efficiency rollout government itself.

How much vaccines Germany received vs administered? 

How much vaccines Norway received vs administered?

This determines efficiency rollout. !Remind one month Wear mask. You‚Äôll fine. downplay this. pipebomb pipebomb.

And pipebomb used disrupt public health facility. care used blackpowder, fireworks fertiliser. know vaccines seem safe now, something comes caused vaccines line? know need time sure.

As masks, mean psychologically harmful. People need face-to-face communication expression, especially children, wearing masks iis screwing development.

At point measures cure virus worse virus itself. states handling undocumented immigrants getting vaccine?    Meanwhile Canada.... Volunteer area get people vote retirement. Pick day third lockdown decreed add days average incubation period. lockdown worked, would taken place there. Add 21 days death curve. 

I done first lockdown realized peak infectiins took place it. lol you‚Äôre describing lot daily thread posters. nuts, there‚Äôs definitely echo here. 

More people see threads likely better representation public. mean don‚Äôt let distract narrative. Fauci said everybody april could vaccinated. going fine. that‚Äôs think people terrified of.

Thank comprehensive post. I'd heard Saint antoine outbreak started looking based post. questions:

You stated *all* residents staff vaccinated December 14th-15th

Later down, wrote 195 residents vaccinated 

Taking total staff residency numbers based article;) article suggested 15 infections found prior administering vaccines, 101 tests **627 residents employees**

Subtracting 195 residents vaccinated would imply 435 staff remain vaccinated. 
 

You wrote 73% residents got infected. Could explain math behind that? 167 residents total infected total 195 vaccinated would add 85%?

If start counting point January 4th wrote second doses would administered, 96 infections, would leave 71 additional infections occur 167 total making 36% 73%, right? I'm confused got number from

If assume total 627 staff residents article states vaccinated suggested would make instead 11% attack rate January 4th. 

I've tried googling around keep seeing contradictory numbers likely based partial assesments ongoing outbreak . I'm able find verifiable information reliable source

 something seem add numbers. seem know situation quite depth., would appreciate clarity able shed light. Sinopharm efficacy actually 79% according latest data. 

The 72% Sinopharm Wuhan, different vaccine hasn‚Äôt approved yet.

The vaccine currently administered around world Sinopharm Beijing.  interviewer team covid.

Same people: ""The government said could open up! dare private establishments encroach freedoms regulating themselves!"" Mortal Kombat April guess. wonder many people politicians listen Dr. Fauci days? mean way listen given latest news Texas. see what's happening Hint, scroll down.

Third wave coming that's happens open enough people vaccinated. Schools closed strict protocols helped also. school height cold flu season germ factory, kids pass germs onto parents, parents pass coworkers, on. Biden declaring needs happen forcing pharmacies participating federal program let teachers get vaccinated now. I'm going mask winter nose never warm, tbh. I've taken many walks much enjoyable. marketing gimmick, nothing more. Look free attention they're getting. Also numbers increase even lockdown really sore arm next day, maybe little sleepy usual next couple days after, besides nothing noticeable.

OUR INDEPENDENCE!!!! First:

Entitled people whose paychecks affected vaguaries historic economic contraction.

Those us less pro-lockdown entitled. ones pay brunt economic contraction.

It important everyone understand that: entitlement lies WFH home zoomers, folks whose lives decimated lockdowns.

Second:

The vast majority Americans protest lockdowns. silly say so.  taking long US get past initial tiers vaccines? lot people fall category, people starting claim co-morbidities that's really case? I've heard people claiming smokers really aren't. sore arm. that's it. That‚Äôs point, aren‚Äôt easily available yet especially older population. sure primary care physicians wouldn‚Äôt involved distribution- data health history, ages etc everyone know would go. Practicing hand hygiene, addition masks, would help. attempt ""gotcha"" missed. much side effects here. Day AZ shot aches pains went 3 hrs. girlfriend hand much worse aches, pains flu like symptoms Pfizer. We're nurses. know anyone arrives conclusion.

It starts informed, am. example, humidity tremendous impact reducing viral transmission. That's climate benefit direct effects cases deaths.

Why taking Cuomo Florida topic Illinois Texas? Kind weird deflection there. theory want look good gave date almost certainly could meet say ‚Äúhey look ahead schedule‚Äù. anyone comes downvotes title seems like scam app, real technology looks small changes body heart rate, temperature etc alert user possible symptoms severe symptoms start. I‚Äôm anti vaccine, can‚Äôt help feel ‚Äúpressured‚Äù getting it. feel like job antagonize getting it, I‚Äôm part protecting around already. It‚Äôd different story lifelong long lasting immunity. Sign up. it‚Äôs gonna ‚Äúget flu COVID shots Walmart‚Äù every year, instantly puts off.  sure! People wear got colds future. realizing day. haven‚Äôt covid, haven‚Äôt ANYTHING year. cold, flu, sniffles, I‚Äôve working IRL whole time masking(but pull sometimes get busy). It‚Äôs crazy. always known get sniffles couple times year are. took labor didn‚Äôt hold end deal time. Biggest reason probably international travel fell 80% can't even get last group vaccinated... eligibility expanded?  provide direct quotations, video, downplaying severity virus, would open changing mind?

Trump downplayed severity virus often supporters rallies.

Trump's rhetoric harmed supporters most. know vaccine prevents spread fully. 

A little topic, told vaccine sure 100% safe won‚Äôt long term adverse side effects. know 100% certainty, yet don‚Äôt know vaccine thing it‚Äôs designed do, prevent spread, considering that‚Äôs probably focus trials?

As said, I‚Äôve done two doses, I‚Äôm saying people shouldn‚Äôt take vaccine. I‚Äôm confused don‚Äôt know vaccine it‚Äôs designed do, yet know 100% certainty it‚Äôs safe mass vaccinate public with.  think might one factors vaccine hesitancy amongst general public. it? takes literally effort. really understand people issue wear piece cloth going around others pandemic?

You‚Äôre speaking though. I‚Äôm partially deaf, mandated masking definitely affected me. Voices muffled masks visors masks makes impossible hear, especially everyone socially distanced least 6 ft away ability read lips masks lips. people don‚Äôt know use sign language. me, communication nearly impossible now. put year now, entire building work 100% vaccinated (it mandated us), can‚Äôt relax wearing masks even around other? Seems bit ridiculous basically 0% close 0% chance catching spreading virus, yet technically fined wearing masks around colleagues. state even discussing taking away break rooms workplace, thankfully never became thing.

I covid I‚Äôm fully vaccinated, I‚Äôm doubly protected catching passing virus, yet step outside apartment without mask, fined police. Oh, mention I‚Äôm person color last year everyone kept saying police interaction could deadly me? Yet people pushing police hassle fine person color basically chance passing virus on.

When say don‚Äôt understand people mandated masking comes inconvenience personally, shows you‚Äôre basically unable see beyond nose empathize others mask mandate inconvenient makes sense given total lack risk. However, wearing masks still helpful here. can't really find good resource vaccines sent countries, China promise hundreds millions doses African countries? tell manifesting anywhere close promised quantities. COVID, plan start masking I‚Äôm feeling weather someone household is. hope culture masking suspect might something spread becomes norm. immune escape mutation South African variant E484K mutation. mutation shared brazilian variant New-York variant. Therefore, people previously infected SA variant protected brazilian new-york variant, theory. insanity, taken measures absurd proportions.

Examples: 
1) became legal, Quebec, go walk friend 3 weeks ago. that, walk friend, masked not, illegal. hugely damaging children.

2) quarantine ""rape"" hotels - whole process ridiculous. Pay three nights, stay one. purpose serve? offer vague answer make sense.

On New Zealand: measure simply COVID cases counts, good. see years come do. COVID endemic, every scientist tells us, New Zealand choice to:

1) Shut borders forever prevent even single case.
2) Lockdown every time case discovered.

This seem like victory me. seems quite damaging. Welcome 20s baby missed good opportunity electric boogaloo joke.  interviewer team covid. asked ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt covid mean never interact public eliminate money altogether?‚Äù pandemic go least next year. Since basically zero flu year, hope learned lessons make use knowledge going forward. it? Honestly? Stfu. shouldn‚Äôt new normal. Care share sources? I'm interested reading topic. gives date soon, passes, still achieved goal, people crucify wrong. 

He either:

1) Say nothing, people give shit saying nothing, nations lead pandemic guy 

OR

2) estimate time, get shit predicting soon enough? Private companies make whatever legal rules see fit businesses. Customers choose private businesses patronize see fit. 

 Businesses need understand shift away mask mandates social distancing move forward. businesses make hard decisions regarding restrictions. Know customers clear warning here.

 Also, celebrating fact states see fit move forward repealing mandates? states experts health officials must feel safe proper decision. time move forward, carefully surely forward. really seems like ""but muh rights"" argument, making choice somehow affect others. That‚Äôs fine right, it‚Äôs separate conversation. Saying deal consequences complain cause doesn‚Äôt work democracy. agree. Texas. ignored advice experts recommended weather-proof energy infrastructure, direct result people died. surprised Texas politicians also ignoring expert recommendations regarding masks? People die, similarly, political powers keep running away Cancun.  feel ya, students, families. getting clear, think California maybe couple states going want stay restriction ship while. Good. everything else right? long wear mask. ignore science people feel confident? justify essential workers getting skipped? entitled thinking ignoring vulnerable at-risk groups. forgot mix phosphoethanolamine cocktail maintain difference asshole firm pointed criticism. 

Oh yes, agree. fell former category, latter! think wrong fall too, would getting whole conversation ""the new normal"" is. biggest risk factor COVID, far age. 25 year old health issues lower mortality rate 65 year old perfectly healthy. also cuts people trying skip line, makes sure every vaccine lowering deaths. also means put 20 factors check them, else take people word, ask people show ID birth date.  everyone bands together ban alcohol again, swear God... Canada think we'll get vaccine coronavirus left building already. Walgreens walk Los Angeles Covid vaccines now. started last week. whistleblower whose numbers claim less 1% difference reported deaths actual deaths? think he's referring retweet Pres.'s Chief Staff. What? They‚Äôre friends, yeah distanced masks.   gavin newsom one governors Us too! :) They‚Äôve built entire vaccine production distribution network month, simultaneously accomplishing nothing else? actually believe that?

Not getting freaking body better believe I'm going picky goes it.

My request reasonable, like I'm asking ""fifth vial made harvest moon"" something like that. maintain difference asshole firm pointed criticism. 

But, civility around. Yeah I'm personally banking around fall stuff actually start seem familiar. Check OP‚Äôs post history. don't? US. guys pretty good. Sometimes, gets forgotten noise.

I mean, we‚Äôve created quite bit unfortunate noise past 4 years. Newsom joke. He's cartoon super villain power trip, nothing more, nothing less. Exactly. doesn‚Äôt mean thing long term effects Covid. lot anxiety stress cause symptoms like headache, racing heart, shortness breath, depression symptoms like lethargy. people suffered social societal side pandemic, labeled ‚Äòlong-Covid‚Äô, vaccines alleviate anxiety stress, turn relieves physical symptoms. think it‚Äôs clear lot long Covid this, therefore study would show vaccines help cure long Covid. 

But probably don‚Äôt relieve actually physical damage like heart valve inflammation. lol. complete strangers? socialized past year all? go focking Guam sick days for?? I‚Äôm Illinois shouldn‚Äôt. Alaska, Hawaii, New York, California, Washington, Florida, Texas, Nevada, etc etc etc

The U.S. effectively size Europe Talking retweet Biden's Chief Staff? Teachers free lot income families. Women particular, harder hit pandemic expected take care kids home. ""coronavirus liked that"" Biden knocking park. ""surveys""? sounds like made up. people want moment SA variant strong side-effects. notably hospital stopped vaccination campaign citing strong side-effects, made much noise Macron's comments. fact think people France even aware Macron's comments. disagree.

The pandemic hurried lot things personally believed still 10 years out.

Imagine unable order burger restaurant medical history card states bad cholesterol levels. Can't beer previously AA meeting. Can't fly Belarus comment liked Twitter.

(Obviously I'm going extreme, far fetched 2021) Good news Canadians we've contracted Pfizer Moderna etc can't get US made vaccines US enough itself. Problem still states better equipped others actually distribute vaccines. guess depends say it. call bunch dumbass hillbillies, won‚Äôt get good response. Biden moved goalposts one already. says wear masks 2022. Great job Texas! Keep winning stupid prizes. Yes. whenever article situation Europe, Asia, Oceania etc.. comments filled Americans talking country/their states? Ok so? everyone else wallow misery past pandemic‚Äôs end that‚Äôll somehow help going loss? dumb take. want stay miserable, that‚Äôs problem dude. People won‚Äôt listen anymore they‚Äôll ton heat *Wilhelmus von Nassauwe ben ijk von Duitsen bloet* need wait 100 days Biden plan fix pandemic! scared wear 2 3 masks possible.

Ok mom. pleasant surprise! exactly designed for. Terrible efficiency idea spot on.  


They need figure make ventilation priority. People forget limited (impossible) testing first. get tested will. Looks like thing happen vaccines . Yes want instantly, never fast enough. tests came, vaccines coming too. I'm negative hateful post stuff bring everyone else down. Stress top killer.

I'll let guess one. adult would like vaccine two. Supply seem problem, administering vaccines even getting people accept vaccine real issues. 40k Norwegian Cruise Line call options, sure hope so. come across kind asshole. checked profile, seems pretty hostile comes subject. understand though. ordeal much lot people bear. Makes unpleasant. Right? I‚Äôm healthy dose pessimism damn, can‚Äôt imagine level bleakness lives people Since started naming unpronounceable names like P.1 B.1.1.7 interview, reported journalists could say this. that. really clear exact sentences full opinion said proper context. 

I feeling supposed ""off"" still reported British journalists, really used practice. way. Uh no, makes return normal immediate. 

Even alternate reality masks social distancing ‚Äúworking‚Äù best slow spread eradicate it, thus leading much slower return normal.  mean, initially told Fauci, CDC surgeon general unnecessary altogether fact harm good. science suddenly change pointed out. messaging masks highly inconsistent whole entire time. Given n95 higher rated mask truly provide protection, I'm sure telling everyone running around bandana neck gaiter helpful nothing putting appearance something. please dont! 

you'll leave much stupid it'll impossible wash off! brought nothing discussion. June 5th. LFG!!!! state moved next phase I'm eligible get vaccinated spending hours trying different places, seems literally impossible schedule appointment anywhere - big chain stores pharmacies, local hospitals, grocers, etc. Walgreens appointments first shot soon tomorrow, cancel scheduling require schedule second shot time, appointments available that.

Sigh. already last months. There's videos YouTube inside nightclubs. fourth surge individuals* become complacent

*and governors See, think exercising right freedom. sticking sissy libs. patriot. whatever narrative let biased corporate-owned media sources hammer brain. really saying ""I'm selfish can't bothered bare minimum fellow man"". fine, guess, stop deluding thinking brave smart patriotic. really, *really* not. showing smooth brained enough think entire planet made fake virus dunk right wing Americans. good look. 

Personally, tend listen experts. know, people spent entire lives studying subject make amount money regardless voters think? people monetary investment think Covid say stupid idea. can't understand trust FOX (which obviously don't), seriously, *seriously* lost. genuinely hope one day make conscious decision critically think often currently do. 

And yes, know, ""b-b-but Florida!"". get ignore literal entire rest planet point one corrupt state governments Union (which currently openly prosecuting whistleblowers shown ""official numbers"" bullshit) example.

That's I'm trying say. recent deaths reported occurred January early February, health department said working backlog death certificates filed time period want wedding!!! past weeks New York *recent* deaths cases per capita Florida fit theory NYC ""early epicenter"" explanation Florida's overall per capita numbers look better?


Also lady show Florida faking anything. actually done GoFundMe grift raise half million dollars gullible people create reports Florida's true covid numbers. problem webpage looks like designed microsoft paint reports wait it... exact numbers Florida's official count.

Hawaii Alaska Guam need watch get slammed Wow. Great comment. particularly liked fact provided literally substantive point response mine. Good job. I'm hoping end summer mask mandate lifted least Maine.

Texas announced today lifting it. imagine shitshow that's coming. lot teachers classroom year Ohio, helps. lot states too. It‚Äôs urban districts haven‚Äôt person option. use 6 mask want **Covid vaccines may stop spread ‚Äòalmost completely‚Äô**

Not Texas announced opening back ending mask mandate. also still wear masks so... could staying inside 2 weeks. yet year 2 shit. Pretty sure people gotten first dose. remember one too. Lelz want guy seen take ""visible risk"" even take bigger ""hidden risk"".

If vaccinate 65+ wrong safe 65+ say cautious following data direct fault extra deaths.

If vaccinate 65+ people die give AZ Phizer much harder seen ""responsible"".

Basically society makes less risky political decision let 1000 people die natural causes 10 people die could considered ""avoidable"" (even meant natural deaths). [Made post based various scenarios Worst case scenario (only Moderna/Pfizer) would still every adult Canada vaccinated end August. AZ coming even considered chart, worst case scenario looking like everyone done early August. Assuming J&amp;J approved (which seems obvious) we'll earlier, extra capacity J&amp;J announced now, imagine moves us ahead well.

Basically shocked beat ""best case scenerio"" chart, finish around July 1. Damm Pres.'s *chief staff*? 

We're headed normal year. people mental problem quarantine vaccine. going lot people insane levels agoraphobia. Therapists going busy. start medical history determine lot you, imo.

Nearly everyone commenting post heralding return summer normality. great, except almost states plan current restrictions get lifted happen. absolutely love game checked mode yet. I'll hop check out. least little bit good came morons complaining though. that‚Äôs state 40k deaths. great job dumbass governor right things looking better ""He boomed me, fucking boomed me,"" said Xi Biden's offensive vaccination campaign. read Abbot ending restrictions, also banning local mask mandates. hold court, right? remember Georgia trying it, go? based ask step scale prove anything getting jab.

Nate Silver tweeted couple days ago

‚ÄúThese amounts enough fully vaccinate 70m Americans per month.

Skipping math, vaccinated pace‚Äîplus accounting people already vaxxed‚Äîit would enough reach ~70% adult (age 16+) population April 30‚Äù

You figure refusal rate would around 30% supply April 30th enough reach everyone wants vaccine. obviously need get administered, states done pretty good job administering they‚Äôve given. Biden also expand FEMA sites work governors. think get least shot everyone‚Äôs arms wants one time May. crazy idea vaccinating would probably never happen. live Orange County. noticed longest time, age group 25-34, usually responsible 20-25% daily cases. idea vaccinate group generates amount cases vaccinating elderly. doubt it. would propose? Keeping restrictions place COVID zero? least wait 50% texas gets vaccinated something like updated advice shortly afterwards. would unreasonable expect guess, especially shortages, given yet evidence. science works.

The advice wear masks 11 months now, people still complain 1 month advice different. knocking you, earth time this? ever feel like need alone time chill recharge? imagine fewer people would wear masks mandate never existed. parents technologically illiterate, highly recommend them. There‚Äôs lot quirks filling forms, finding appointments, checking right time day. 

I found appointment two days starting look (1B+ here). Someone technologically savvy able find appointment within days week you‚Äôre flexible location time. Facebook group tips need get one effectively. Getting one specifically nearest pharmacy perfect time much harder. drive 30 mins appointment take extended lunch break work, it‚Äôs worth it. Right, like every European country great. far touch reality social norms believe Americans would willingly lock inside months end? want see every lol

I agree though I've become super efficient. I'm going give US credit assume end, higher uptake vaccines 75%.

Currently, vaccinated enough 36 million americans fully vaccinated. 270 million Americans 16+.  Lets say 88% uptake.  240 million Americans vaccinated, 204 million left.  depends amount Johnson &amp; Johnson, bit guess right now, lets say 50 million get J&amp;J vaccine then, that's 154 million left, needing 2 doses. That's 308 million doses + 50 million J&amp;J.  That's 358 million doses.  End May like 90 days away. That's basically 4 million doses day administered, every single day.

At 75% uptake, that's still 283 million doses required 50 million J&amp;J, still 3 million doses day, every single day.

I say impossible, it'd quite feat. Regardless though, need reach point normal summer.  guys done actually administering July, that's pretty impressive either way. Governor Abbott's plan covid-19 disabled? plan provide well-being future? Kids? may issue vaccines drive rates negligible well. Covid spreading everywhere doubt many safe parents going cool kids getting infected. Well lil bit. one seems mentioning selection pressure vaccines create targets. 

If rush back soon without full herd immunity likely new variants evolve around vaccines. 

I'm worried April everyone rushing back world acting like everything fine. create new variants come back vegeance winter. too, unfortunately came time working getting lol say this? want know know true. trying negative. potential heart damage concerning, want know willy nilly let kids go back normal feel like still unnecessary risk. grocery store gets thousands visitors week (if day) Houston, every known variant. 

I'd comfortable if/when vaccine readily available. Good. Private businesses still enforce masks want stay home so. Texas cities school year bunch stuff already open following guidelines anyways. isn‚Äôt going monumental impact many think it‚Äôs big jump already place here.  Idk this, skin itches like hell summer onwards. happens like twice month, time happens daily. think stress tends happen tough spot mentally downright angry. yeah, never experienced stress levels angryines(is even word created right now?) like Covid.... think depression tends work idk American anti-intellectualism point pride people. We're regressing cavemen cavemen profitable. Cavemen used useful idiots force economy open sooner, damn human consequences.

 Clungo scare thing see. Kinda - understanding vaccinated people may get symptomatically ill, nearly many fatally so. Beaches, general outdoor areas, spreads. We've known since last Spring. States already jumping gun saying ""fuck it, everything back open next week"" want get worse? mean dropping 95% effectiveness 85%?

Still enough achieve herd immunity. would advise wearing mask even it‚Äôs mandated work end summer. It‚Äôll likely take 2-3 years pandemic anymore. high percentage world need get vaccinated, isn‚Äôt going relatively quick considering anti-vaxors, vaccine available X age specific jobs atm, etc. 

You keep wearing mask throughout entire pandemic, even get vaccinated. Remember, vaccine decreases chance you‚Äôll get whatever it‚Äôs supposed protect from. *can* still get it. Don‚Äôt take chance; wear mask. Protect yourself, family, around you. üôÑ US rest western world done lot production capacities open up. point distribution bottleneck I'm expecting lot international aid done.

But yeah, 6-12 months behind US probably realistic Yes. Unfortunately. due time. too!! would guess fine. Seems like states less going honor system work retail think good given definition listed. Make appt! point claim America would top 10 5 without cost mean anything really hope so. am, still first phase 1a, cancelling appointments due shortage. mom's husband 64 active leukemia, half paralyzed stroke too, still qualified! They'll get next phase, there's telling happen. need live him, atm seems like I'll never able get it. 'cause he's 64 65. Covid literally means death :(
 
If even gotten category yet, seems pretty hard get anywhere close main population may. (Southern Arizona) I‚Äôm 42 years old! They're good lmao That's makes horrible, basically 3 months away ending ... we're pretty much guaranteed get another big surge dumb governors throwing caution wind.  Oh god there‚Äôs term it. Carry on, I‚Äôll chill revelation. I'm high. Maybe point Yeah increase quarterly total known now.

These also included letter Dutch government parliament 2nd February 2021. Netherlands says deliver 7,8 million doses Pfizer vaccine Q2. would 2,2 million vaccines Ireland Q2.

It confirmed now. weekly deliveries April track 7,8 million Q2. 7,8 million Pfizer doses Netherlands almost certain reality now. Also, higher latest estimation 200,000 deliveries per week April. 30th good 38th good?

How saying 30th better 38th controversial statement want argue built past conservatives sold they‚Äôre super smart business guys. Yeah Texas lockdown reduced capacities, mask mandate reason removal case. Texas relatively well things considered comparison harsh-lockdown state cousins?

I think ending mask mandates bit silly, also think many continue wear anyway.

If Texas *wants* reopen, maybe they'll example whether vaccine significant effect?  Yeah, like islands Thailand, Vietnam China? testing big deal, allows people make informed choices. can‚Äôt believe didn‚Äôt consult first Good them, shouldn‚Äôt turning anyone away. Every person vaccinated one step closer herd immunity. There‚Äôs story bottom vaccine success story I‚Äôm pen 

(It never phase.) Thanks taking time find data (or least summary). clearly shows number reinfections much higher 62 scientifically validated cases reinfection.

 [COVID-19 reinfection tracker - BNO 

Worth noting five proven cases Colorado report added dataset, testifies accuracy.

The CDPHE data shows reinfection accounts 0.19% recorded infections. think needing one dose help J&amp;J lot also, agree end demand split relatively equally. hardly rocket science. divide 6. important see hospilzations deaths do. 1000% give excuse skip wedding costs. state live in? Reinfection happening months. [""First Covid-19 reinfection documented Hong Kong, researchers article August 2020. Various people died reinfection going back months also. probably antibiotics might impact it. Also want move talk got wisdom teeth You‚Äôll actively hurting children due yellow journalism sensationalism don‚Äôt let socialize live without fear. elevated risk year Covid vs year flu. part caused mask fatigue. thought pretty much everyone agreed masks necessary outside, big movement worn everywhere time outside, inside, house, tv, etc. get people thought good way normalize stupids whatever, doubt much effect. Made go fine wearing occasionally really disliking much pushed told unnecessary outside prior. believe Fauci said he's opinion there's reason people can't small meet-ups long everyone vaccinated ~7% state vaccinated.

And decent chunk within past couple days fully protected time requirements drop. Actually, smoking ordinances passed pretty much statewide TX little 10 years ago. go where, hospital? Cancun? Can't find link right older people tend fewer side effects vaccine. Belgium country population 11m compared UK 67m really equal comparison. We'll see, going 10% US population vaccinated 100% 3 months pretty ambitious. I'm start making plans June even July yet. point vaccinated well % people getting hospitalized people ones risk...
You question asking planet I‚Äôm living on...
I explain targeting elderly millennials that‚Äôs they‚Äôve vaccinated risk...
I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre problems grasping simple concept want slam Mississippi keep society closed 99.4% survival rate...
But...wow...just wow...

Mississippi ranks 44 50 vaccinations. That's nothing brag about. 

[Vaccinations fair compare Texas's actions we're ramping vaccinations nearing end pandemic actions taken year ago?

Basically every state US form ""open"" since last summer, believe Abbot's order affects local mask mandates.  Bruh, shit tons people received vaccine yet. smoking? lol covid's actually upward trajectory israel now. highest daily cases 2 weeks today. sigh. makes sense anymore. guess. see left right wing candidate gain enough popularity then, hope I'm wrong tho. give single shit dead grandmas. Texas continues amaze stupidity. Congrats!! Hoping goes well enjoy planned events lives again. likely 90% psychosomatic Spread choas üî•üî•üî• No; mRNA vaccines made without using cells all.

They use cell lines derived aborted children testing, manufacture. first shift work without mask real flip switch says Also huge difference repealing mask mandates March 10th repealing even weeks later. got J%J vaccine end March able vaccinate lot people. also takes two weeks time get vaccine time protected dropping mask requirements early seems dangerous. Whatever happened ""my body choice""?

Downvotes 3..2..1.. get hammered go... Im American agree. Feels great able look US again! know supply chain delays, etc. technically enough time get reliable testing. get test Thursday get results appointment would safest bet. sure availability, turn around time like around you.

If don‚Äôt symptoms week it‚Äôs also unlikely you‚Äôre infected. I‚Äôd probably go ahead get it. it‚Äôs easy get another appointment could wait days. Lol state crying last week people said f ""frozen""? going okay! 

It may seem like world ending requiring everyone wear piece cloth face, bit really not.

If feel undue emotional stress, may time talk therapist surprise really. side effects first 4-5 hours, arm pain lasted 2 days. Also felt like bad hangover day half so.  Lmfao. TIL: pretending pandemic even real year ""warp speed"" They‚Äôre going die like Florida Iowa. Remember super bowl spreader? ...it includes cost, that's isn‚Äôt quite correct.

It‚Äôs known Pfizer data since early early Dec 1st dose offers protection early days 12-13 trial data effectiveness 1 dose. think ""every adult"" includes least portion people vaccine-hesitant interested all. could cry. think studies emerge pandemic huge interest long time. Long term complications, behavioural effects, tracking reporting new strains variants.

There loads areas discussed next ten years, really great there‚Äôs coronavirus post front page every day! That's probably give vaccination card. Granted look pretty easy forge. Hey makes lot sense, thanks taking time respond. failing put together. Makes sense, sure, virus *live* surface air, way easier airborne *enter* body. you‚Äôre going willingly curb going plans winter months? I'm sure dead grannies thank you. It‚Äôs getting clear now. idea normal returning 2022 beyond over. It‚Äôs happening year likely back completely July Sounds like they‚Äôre allowed make personal choice (not get vaccinated) nobody else (to wear mask). shocker. 30th 191 bad? New single day record Canada! Yes. Inject directly my... arm. Take florida. restrictions since last summer, one oldest populations states, yet absolutely fine pretty well. Also, bear mind deaths counted death within 28 days positive test, that's going factor lot innacuracy comes counting. It‚Äôs tough tell. state distributing it‚Äôs channels (even funded feds), makes sense get dictate rules. feds direct contracting private pharmacies I‚Äôm sure pharmacies need abide guidelines individual states mandated listen fed rules. Oxford vaccine bunk. Pfizer Moderna master race!! Completely agree. Unfortunately Covid stay. accept it, live (not die from) it, hope quickly becomes manageable.

My wish nearly everything changes it. I'd like think poor souls died vain, really learn it. Covid exposed dark, deeply disturbing underbelly America maybe world. name things consider: Lack response responsibility global warming/climate change; use outdated tech; using tech prudently; fraud; political deception; corporate greed; erosion human rights; health care, name few. clear, USCCB National Catholic Center bioethics said taking Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine morally permissible alternatives readily available. thought MRNA using cells? never understanding 

its selfish terrible definitely perfect, much better could Abbott fucking moron, else new here. amazing wasn‚Äôt flu season year. solution pollution dilution. put giant bubble Texas, see happens? said hold Florida around month ago people shat lol. Catholic Church went add: ‚Äúit‚Äôs young vaccine, we‚Äôd like get hands it, private, examination.‚Äù evidence support that?

Because study includes 90% total population 70's England Scotland showed immunity reaction similar age groups. framing argument get wanting end restrictions people still want drag entire thing entire year longer 2022.

There's big segment people want give finish line literally sight couple months longer everyone chance get vaccinated not. Avoid politics. I‚Äôm sure examples island nations easily closed borders veritable authoritarian dystopias lock people homes followed rest world. far know nation list larger continent didn‚Äôt go extreme authoritarian measures stop spread Vietnam, relatively underdeveloped country may well reported things avoid panic population. Yeah still excuse fact US leadership totally botched handling pandemic. mountain evidence far less debatable thread's topic. I'll happy go visit friend, sit bar them, enjoy beer. Hell yeah. Let‚Äôs go texas!!!  mods remove misinformation. Still takes body work immunity getting vaccine probably July 1 realistic. We're going entire whole era weird theme restaurants market people want dining experience feel normalcy

I welcome post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  40 people including children died massive pile shit. Yep, 95% reduction chance mean something vastly different July 2021 November 2020. 45 50 seems point. reason ratchet beyond keep things orderly. people currently traveling florida I'd wager  idea happening Sweden moment first post already showed. La Jolla seems ball lately studies sars 2 immunity learned this? beginning pandemic ... I'm going assume done good faith really miss references end article rather read article all. That's great attitude. still carrier pass Covid without knowing, even vaccine.  popcorn amazing. Order real butter. check Israels cases/death often they‚Äôre good thought they‚Äôd be. hit wall? seems UK‚Äôs ‚Äúdrop‚Äù areas much clearer picture (yes know lockdown based). mandate gave many people like excuse wear one without ostracized ‚Äúweak,‚Äù bc isn‚Äôt choice longer, it‚Äôs government made it. 

This appears key.

In area, exception cops security, rarely see police wearing masks mandate. idea businesses would like protect staff customers going enforce masks without getting ugly. Along lifting restrictions places 100% capacity, people going forced work dangerous situations lot rent forgiveness loans going stop become due. actually read article?  people get vaccinated rates fall background radiation levels people go back old ways. People East Asia wear masks unwell, otherwise people largely wear masks go shopping about.

What sizable portion? 1%? 5%? 

Masks ""big deal,"" never something every day MATTER WHAT. wore reason.

It‚Äôs silly argue wear masks forever. lives weren‚Äôt terribly risky vaccinate disease dust won‚Äôt risky afterward. cases hopefully wind soon well push enough people get vaxxed. point really matter got vax didn't, long much concerned about....  understand. Florida better worse state they've open months  crazy thing people homes don‚Äôt want vaccine. would like see number unvaccinated people vs vaccinated dying. I'm fucking glad governor rescinded order. time explain part someone, certainly specifically, understands individual words post fact ""old school"" vaccines use eggs mRNA ones don't, idea words eggs business accelerate things allow drifted strains? Thank behalf person who, again, definitely me. Whys everyone trying talk em round? dont want fuck em let countries want it..leave em it. Texas vaccine distribution second country missed week due freeze. infrastructure still there, it‚Äôs back full swing now. wouldn‚Äôt consider Texas vaccine distribution horrific performance all. No, they'll still going. instead going watch films, they'll go complain pretend victimized. replies hilarious. Get fucking wrecked. Biden idea Florida 2 hours. go well. Thing seriously think I‚Äôm sort anti vax protester reality I‚Äôm probably going get (more protect blacklisted/targeted work). I‚Äôm people wanna do. live life protect others. DARE ask questions thoughts WHY. I‚Äôm scumbag apparently. Yep, I'm eligible Tennessee already, moving another 30 days. Can't wait officially book appt within next weeks!!!! That's tad dramatic. Florida opened months ago they're better worse states stayed locked masked. Maybe guy looking real-life examples making decision. least public wear masks regardless mandate, right?

Seems mayor local politicians easily bring back curfews lockdowns.  I‚Äôm ‚Äúsniveling coward‚Äù wear mask? Nice projection. I‚Äôd say you‚Äôre coward wearing one. Afraid Trump buddies laugh see wearing one?  No, would open changing mind. Lol Even vaccine made 100% immune virus, somehow could still spread I'd still wear mask. Anti-mask sentiment selfish people understand means live society act overall good. think plan vetting places travel that's back normal. already know I'm avoiding/already avoiding pandemic fairly clear never plan spending money now. Odd way saying ‚ÄúPfizer needs payment‚Äù He'll come back tell he's Phd something knows he's talking about. always negative slant. ""We still 100% sure human-to-human transmission ""We still 100% sure masks ""We still 100% sure virus less transmissible ""We still 100% sure vaccines ""We still 100% sure cases go ""We still 100% sure vaccine effective variants.""

**You ""We still 100% sure vaccines reduce transmission."" ""We still 100% sure kids return ""We still 100% sure we'll get vaccine everyone wants one end ""We still 100% sure 70% country vaccinated enough lockdowns safely ""We still 100% sure time remove mask ""We still 100% sure safe start filling stadiums ""We still 100% sure lock ""We still 100% sure we'll never need another COVID lockdown again."" Yes, agree pandemic coming end US several months (assuming current vaccine trends continue, assuming new vaccine-escape variant). societal level, agree it'd best (epidemiologically speaking) continue taking precautions till then. friend decides safe enough relax precautions... well, except Kant's categorical imperative, can't really object making choice himself.

And also, even though pandemic almost certainly ending soon, surprised prominent people continue claiming unsafe. We've already seen going far beyond data before, we've seen huge claims unvaccinated children continuing spread disease. expect continued panic-mongering well fall, longer. hell would want travel right now?! alwayshasbeen.jpg Oh wow, found one news station seems carrying it. checked top 5 Texas news outlets whiff utility news front page them. Yeah, definitely setting foot place mask mandate, 70% Americans agree me. Watching anti-mask idiots create shops need mask watching shops go bankrupt awesome!  Honestly, professors, staff, frontline workers, high risk people community vaccinated point, exceedingly likely, what's problem? Reopening full capacity Autumn honestly conservative estimate.

It's possible live life substantively 2019 small tweaks could greatly improve health health community live in.

I understand everyone make choice, that's fine. Myself, flu season, see responsible member society try avoid getting giving virus kills order half million people every year. know, thing me. see many movies theaters covid. would like indoor brewery without anxiety.  high hopes vaccine. Efficacy rates seems high, tell, producing updates tackle variants quick easy. also ""third option"" us Australia, 50M doses order (assuming approved). would said ‚Äúnah probably not‚Äù today Texas ‚Äúopening everything 100% NOW‚Äù 7% vaccinated it‚Äôs like we‚Äôre asking it.  one large state today said ‚Äòno masks, everything goes back normal‚Äô midst pandemic,‚Äù Newsom told reporters San Luis Obispo touring vaccination site, noting Texas higher test positivity death rates California.

Second part remixing said fit Republiqan narrative. I‚Äôm sure counts relatively strong immune reaction short fever pain (1 day), lost smell it‚Äôs still slowly coming back 6 weeks. wonder counts long covid. I've followed it

""And star that, Poldy?"" won‚Äôt able work home that‚Äôs biggest one. suspect retailers keep curbside, don‚Äôt intestinal fortitude patience go shops deal bullshit people anymore. Like New Zealand?

Fuck em.

aside anything anecdotal, anyone projections current spread r0 texas like? governor banking people businesses safe. 

I understand need open up; however, seems wreckless considering 13% Texans received 1st dose vaccine. mRNA vaccines distribution issue. Moderna stored -4C (normal e.g. chest freezer), shelf stable fridge 30 days. Pfizer recently announced shown vaccine stable stored -5F -15F, common pharmaceutical freezers.

The US *already shipping mRNA vaccines corner-store pharmacies.* Sounds like great recipe get Covid 8 weeks vaccine appointment. know hard, wait little get vaccinated instead infected? 100% divert attention power failure earlier month Look Australia NZ. Also, lockdowns April 2020 effective. 

The whole USA implemented lockdowns effectively summer 2020. Well close over, relapse fall, it‚Äôll feb 2022. afraid continue worry everyone else awhile. everyone household vaccinated would amazing though. People wearing fucking masks. Get yourself. watch Texas's covid number rise why? Pfizer Moderna vaccines better performance, J&amp;J still provides amazing efficacy way better typical flu vaccine. fact need freezer single-dose reason beneficial give teachers Happy 69th award Right?? Colorado medical workers, 70+, 65+, educators, right opening 60+ 2 comorbidities. One comorbidity grocery workers end March, general populace that. state‚Äôs gonna vaxxed max May!

Helps competent non-idiots running government. Exactly Great Gatsby reference  Can‚Äôt wait till cruises get back good old norovirus.  Florida ended coronavirus restrictions September Here's better discussion actual professor immunology PhD: also long history telling people problems like head. suffers Gulf War Syndrome told head. Women diagnosed ""hysteria"" literally centuries. pattern going happen again.

And tell someone head, treating anxiety fix it, means comfortably explain issue weak psyche ignore it.

Assuming right start without going possible physical causes transparently attempt shelve problem.

And consider people jumping conclusion anxiety wrong guilty proven innocent literally hundreds years prior failure behind argument.

Starting assumption heads like starting assumption rape victims lying -- instead way around. California never relaxed everything - relaxed little actually really know sarcasm not... I'm going yes Also one contracts Johnson Johnson could one dose.  left Texas June cause scared stay longer. Everyone thought crazy worrying shit like power grid, natural disaster preparedness, organized Covid denialism. feel bad people there. I‚Äôm really glad made choice.  Agree. Even recommendation public wear KN95 masks instead bandannas earlier would big help. still things post Pandemic?. I‚Äôm calling now: people vaccinated, fringe group conservative Christians protesting saying soon go back normal. group people refused wear masks entire time. far people wanting socialize, sure. roaring 20s period economic boom tandem socialization. don‚Äôt imagine we‚Äôll see 2021 health care plans, mine, charge additional fee currently smoker. answered 'yes', enough verification. 

Btw, Group 4a. NC broken groups phases (1a, 1b, 2a, 2b, 2c, 3a, 3b (where state now)). group 4a 18- 64 medical conditions high risk Covid. Somehow technically, group (hypertension), well managed medication. may later half Group 4. IDK, NC covid website says Group 4.

ETA: hate Gizmodo click bait headlines. Yeah I'm legit going cry previews start. feel like NJ point many people died first wave probably got like...eh, now. Also, whole point restrictions lighten load hospitals seems like hospitals overloaded.

That's iffy thing lockdowns. like, want completely kill COVID lighten load hospitals? lighten load hospitals, think NJ probably okayish open. 

Now think states keep mask mandate least couple months encourage social distancing much possible...also outdoor activity indoor.

At certain point, also become issue economy can't kill bunch small businesses without giving aid. NJ probably suffered economically state (if most, definitely top 5, would imagine) choice people have? 

I would rather restaurants open point people choice go not. personally stepped foot indoors anything (except groceries) I'm going get angry restaurant owners choosing open struggling like year. Houston recently first report current variants city, matter time... would've turned walked away. Life short speak stupidity. hell? one forced take vaccine Israel. Hopefully. I'm planning maybe going year so. cares Quoting Evening Standard like broken pencil. Pointless.   depend lot things.

Will companies force people back office? cities/states tax wfh people go back office (would beneficial downtown restaurants example big lobbying group). 


These going hot button issues next year. Even employer allows it, much tax would tolerate wfh even one day week? 1% high 5%?

For think. Cities like NY LA depend occupancy everything industry public transit operate break even. Florida 50 teachers based initial supply allocations J&amp;J. enough supplies educators moment.  policy appropriate SARS, transmission occur prior onset symptoms. Thus general population isolate symptomatic PPE preserved healthcare workers first responders.

We're talking PPE needed hospitals, though, jack. We're talking cloth masks. litany studies going back 70s show provide least protection respiratory infections. CDC spokespeople media literally mocked idea. months later said ""well acktualleh.."" lied. known science.

Why continue lick CDC's boot?

I listening podcast talking studies show extended mask use led poor outcomes reduced oxygen intake, dampness not. forget details think it‚Äôs apparent n95s cloth mask something. 

If you‚Äôre wearing like ten minutes doesn‚Äôt really matter wearing day cause problems. Fuck workers, guess. Anyone choose maskless workers don‚Äôt exactly get choice exposed hundreds maskless people. idiots wear mask already planning refuse vaccine. now? Extended loss smell/taste symptoms definitely happens covid, known happen flu even common cold (although less frequently). syndrome multiple symptoms fatigue, pains, covid-like symptoms also happens, technically ""long covid"", pretty different things. 

The latter probably anxiety element (which make less real), previous probably doesn't. great state Louisiana.

Being sarcastic there, really Governor best considering hostile Republican government every level. he's ease back lockdown measures since Republicans throw fit, specially Texas removed everything. It‚Äôs amazing US done, given adults full doses vaccines, whereas U.K. still given folks one half doses. quite, least me. appointment first round vaccination coming Thursday.

Wtf???

I also really enjoy biographal context authors experience. Fitzgerald character, bromance Hemingway one greatest dysfunctional relationships literature.

Check states worst numbers come talk me. don‚Äôt see talking shit governors m. biased fool. Smh like Super Bowl super spreader Florida? Texas says ‚ÄòYEE FUCKIN HAW‚Äô want pessimistic.

In words, ""uhhh maybe"".

This article actually really funny ambiguous wording, like every single article clickbait titles. best news could gotten today. give caution start going back movies every weekend eating restaurants. thought going like August could get shot. would enough me. wait June. would make great story r/prorevenge Maybe can‚Äôt get licensed approved countries, due strict approval processes. relying vaccines developed tested major pharmaceutical companies, piggyback approvals already received vaccines. Good take. it‚Äôs natural disaster, timeline don‚Äôt think serious damage world economies sessional basis order reduce 10th leading cause death reasonable. perspective argument. Millions people die every year. waste time effort hyper focused preventing flu it‚Äôs virus. I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs symptom tissue scarring like lung scarring, related covid effect. It‚Äôs also permanent guess Lina Hidalgo tried impose restrictions Harris County, Houston, early on, Abbot struck down. 

If Abbot let counties set rules I'd less pissed course needs Loving County population 169 quite different Harris County population 4.5 million, treated way. Counties make good argument different covid rules due population density able so. france Europe often use say EU Humans evolved respond humans facial expressions. part respond emotion relate people, masks dehumanizing. costs this. Probably NY California summary wrong, someone needs rewrite web page linked to.

 *Colorado Department Public Health Environment adding 822 cases data dashboard today meet standard national criteria define persons second infection virus causes COVID-19. cases report dates Aug. 20, 2020, Feb. 28, 2021, represent 0.19% Colorado‚Äôs total case count.*  Looks like another solid decrease cases last week today. 3 days row. Canada isn‚Äôt opening border 2022 eh? That‚Äôs also take. I‚Äôm talking people think Texas throwing restrictions window literally today good sound idea. coincidence! also hit time low! choice many infections deaths want accept absolutely political decision. eradication impossible, means decide society many COVID deaths we‚Äôre willing live every year, consensus dictate business restrictions mask mandates (if any) stay place. Really? I‚Äôve actually surprised many people know Houston gotten far, many places advertising it. also apparently completely open, so... hope holds true. I've promised 5 year old son take city 1st time safe we're back normal. Hopefully end summer Jays back there. can‚Äôt wait hug family again. state added pregnant women current vaccination phase bumped in. can‚Äôt wait hope husband, along rest world, won‚Äôt far behind. million vaccinations day started Trump won‚Äôt get ridiculed. IMO, general opinion wait vaccines generally available, drop restrictions. past 7 months I‚Äôve running face mask actually putting mouth run someone. Nice winter, much summer, overall bad. Ready done however. Well, mean, bit different taking much deliveries vaccines can. aren‚Äôt spares vaccines sitting around government pick choose ones take. 

We also capability store distribute vaccines nearly areas. gather enough know formulate questions cover entire scope potential covid side effects. image asking friends butthole genital functions Zero respect anyone thinks good morally respectable. country need figure delayed gratification. Things certainly looking up, doesn‚Äôt mean go buck wild immediately! 

But sure, let‚Äôs needlessly kill people couldn‚Äôt wait couple months vaccinate significant portion population. feel absolutely awful anyone working Texas. may get choose want head bars shops maskless, workers don‚Äôt get choose whether want exposed maskless patrons day. better, piece shit States like Texas pretending post-Covid already! I‚Äôm hoping Johnson Johnson one getting approved happen shortly. excellent news.

There areas country people might trouble getting vaccine, people make least monthly trip Walmart. neither side trust single thing says days, extremists yell loudest. 

If ask me, probably schedule ""Back normal"" May 1st. gives month half get 1st doses weeks let immunity settle in.

 Personally, think experts would agree this, personally, think intentionally lying know announce vaccine solves problems, everyone shot yet going take reason go back normal right now. 

Just like lied masks last march. good reason behind it, constant lying erodes trust, seeing results now. 

The half society listened media pedal constant fire brimstone shaming anyone went outside. think single COVID case good reason keep home however long takes single COVID case. 

So that's right now. Free thought trust even listening side dead.

Good news barring sort horrific variant going pretty soon. Vaccinations started Trump. million per day. Go ahead slobber Biden though 2 week quarantine border closing would effect done correctly. would difficult yes, there's reason stopped COVID LEAST July August followed strict protocols. 

Also, I'd hardly say Australia barely international travel. Canada vaccinated next year :)  go big thread it, definitely folks wishing harm upon Texas. watched redditors dance graves Texans week choice leaders. Hell yes folks wishing bad results now. I‚Äôm wondering stabbing pain center gluteus muscles hip sockets are, walk roll bed night. It‚Äôs like sciatic nerves compressed. Let Roaring 20s Part II begin! live tourist town. beach, history, cruise ships. coming summer going crazy. Well, maybe cruise ships we're going get inundated.  I'm sure much better source research foundation/institution actually located Brazil (the place concern topic) orwell guy onto something glad Trudeau. Trump 4 years... stupid why. think PA NJ too. think spot on. smell/taste now? honestly think also depend wedding look like. People largely seem think may US magically go back normal , optimism infectuous extent. think likely transitional period least months mask-wearing still common (perhaps even enforced locations). might still hundreds people gather without social distancing masks nightclub, example. Difference response administration compared last one day night. know long would needed for, suppose would depend heavily variants, anti-vaxers, things fathom time.

Could see morphing, rather quickly, first covid. also measles, chicken pox.... implemented think really goes away. alter used for, die out.

So haunted house? Probably not. concert. sporting event. amusement park. Ya, could see long term. 10mo boat. I'm sad ILs never held newborn: tiny, relatively immobile. he's chonky, walking tornado. saw pictures video chatted teeny, same. 

We gotta hang there, keep sensible safety measures, get jabbed! disaster beginning. Schools never shut down. minimum, every student country person education fall. Even offering online learning comparable joke. It‚Äôs criminal kids. Jesus Christ effective Pfizer vaccine early stages? 

For example, expect protection 3 days 1 week first dose?  Well said. Julia Marcus, epidemiologist writes articles Atlantic, written lot exact thing‚Ä¶ abstinence-only approach. 1. actual rate exactly 66%. That‚Äôs average global trials. US, 74%.

2. rate 60-70 percent range actually quite good. Flu shots range 10-20% bad year 50-60 better year. 

3. Protection disease isn‚Äôt on/off switch. Even get sick, every approved vaccine drastically lowers chance severe illness. virus isn‚Äôt big deal causes cold 30% exposed people. 

4. Think big numbers. large percentage people can‚Äôt get sick all, we‚Äôll stop seeing large outbreaks virus. Combined fraction get sick needing hospitalization, COVID would become akin mild flu. 

5. single-shot vaccine stored standard temperatures make much easier coordinate vaccination rural/transient populations, low-income people, housebound people, etc.  wife two days 2nd reaction all. Needless say got trouble it. take word it, ask New Zealand etc well works base policy science. Yup. dude thinks everyone traveling US real lost value. People can't travel internationally right never could unfortunately probably never will. time spring break tourist revenue! nightmare end. look like trying cause panic anything, always media people love blowing things proportion. wearing-o multiple-o masks o's I've dreams sweet. don‚Äôt choose virus finished. you‚Äôre revolutionary; you‚Äôre selfish scared can‚Äôt sit bar Hey look, it‚Äôs another talking point never played way promised would.

Humbled hopeful, also absolutely can‚Äôt wait tear time right!! actually test positive assuming Covid? would better argument actually said something simplistic ""masks work"" ""surfaces spreads"". messaging close suggesting. said they're unsure whether masks help advise them, said they're unsure spreads wash hands clean surfaces. honestly see problem. hopefully means anti-vaxxers already virus. 10 full days quarantine would around people 9th, said.

May end date, that's beginning end date. Well, US, UK, UAE, Israel endgame, maybe Chile - we're still looking 5 countries double-digits % population vaccinated, 4 track nationwide vaccination adults mid summer

And rest, EU described increasing trajectory. Globally, going least rest year longer.

And that's assuming face new variants render vaccines ineffective - many people infected virus running rampant poorer countries right now, lot chances mutations occur.

Frankly, even like say 5 countries woods yet. Depends pharmacy, done 4. Bring wall death! seriously can't wait get hammered smashed group sweaty metalheads. I'm also likely old care point. long. dont get people want keep wearing stupid things. Im saying Texas isnt stupid fact matter people sick tired wearing them.

Summer George ! hope so?? state boomer phone line gives boomer appointments Can't wait real thing, dinner movie. Teachers work near fridges communities already giving mrna can‚Äôt state governments see this? shouldn‚Äôt opening willy nilly finally brought hospitalizations cases. open things gradually based vaccination metrics? Like let‚Äôs reach certain threshold people vaccinated start opening things up? Yes that's exactly means. getting same-day jabs. Depending state general population expect first dose vaccine sometime around August-October assuming everything progresses current rate. entirely hopeful we‚Äôll seeing part tbh Feds bypass states direct pharmacy program actually barrier. Moderna fridge stable, Pfizer approved two weeks regular freezer thawing, J&amp;J standard fridge. Family practice could move vaccines, states generally providing shots offices.  Yeah, masks mandated country level. order specifically takes authority away countries unless hospitalizations rise significantly.  Especially Texas kills half May. fear could flareups Texas March 10th ""reopening"" Texas though. :(

Here's hoping get jab LOT people next week. technically possible, Moderna Pfizer vaccines proven effective new variants far. good. Wife got married November 2019, almost scheduled April 2020. Congrats nuptials. albeit maybe mask moving around. 

nope Probably dumb question ask try schedule appointment:

That includes immunosuppressants right? Florida open since summer 2020. They're better hard lockdown states.  Sometimes think it'll feel whenever first walk front door mask, fully vaccinated, thought getting sick even cross mind. even remember that's like. everything covid. That‚Äôs see many governors even would considered liberal states starting move forward. point can‚Äôt wait last case covid declared recovered. passed possibility 10‚Äômonths ago. /r/confidentlyincorrect reminds Batman villain. Offh, Texas can't even beat Cali total cases deaths, trying, I'll give'em /s Message sent  really taking seriously months now

And feel righteously vindicated... think many wore masks solely mandate. hell break loose... least risk likely vaccinated possible surge happens again. people still die, though, lax attitude happens bill gates money said he‚Äôd give help production vaccines? hope hit 50-60% start shipping internationally That‚Äôs definitely understandable, get feeling little distrustful health officials point. However, need remember 0% protection without vaccine. Unless we‚Äôre talking difference week two, personally high-risk, it‚Äôs good trade off. There‚Äôs good chance you‚Äôll able get super high efficacy vaccine later booster. 

I think we‚Äôre also different situation start pandemic. know vaccines work advertised massive, real-world studies. study protocols, results, press releases available public. Great Gatsby reference Anxiety causes real physical symptoms. Even flare-ups serious (existing) auto-immune diseases. Michigan even 20k deaths total. nursing home love shit trumps term handled within month Biden getting along. Rationale forward solutions. Working it, waiting transfer year now. real hope yet. want US approve it... LOL ... can't even supply approved already. real problem vaccinations even made significant dent population constantly moving likely infect others (they've finished large portion nursing homes Dallas).

That's fine focus hospitals, real concern increasing infection rates, especially variants spotted Texas, going cause vaccinated people potentially get infected. 99.999% fine, real issue comes chance mutation happens makes virus avoid vaccine.

We legitimately wait end May everyone vaccinated. hard wait. shit show . There's lot people age group, thus ""baby boomer"" part baby boom. they're currently 17% US population.  also growing demographic. line vaccinated people still spreading getting flimsy. all. combination post-Viral syndrome (which talking about) plus anxiety, plus (hopefully non-permanent) organ damage (especially lung damage). idea sort separate, new thing called ""Long COVID"" really stretching bounds believability. REALLY really hated mask first (never refused wear though). past year I've grown tolerate it, still cannot fucking wait we're done them. think I've got pretty crappy face mask wearing though - full beard makes awkward, I've got glasses fog well. Plus hair long shit barber year. makes pretty damn annoying think. think weird question, US selling this? Well Japanese east Asian people responsible westerners. I'm Mexico now. awesome! Try walking store without shirt shoes see works Media flip 4-6 weeks: ‚Äúvaccine widely available. Trump voters preventing return normal‚Äù wear whole hazmat suit rest life. die don't! lady California yelled car walking alone outside without mask. It‚Äôs one dumbest things someone ever said especially considering literally 100 feet Nevada border one would question maskless outside. I'm curious specific. age ranges lie? want answer one. day go gym work without mask might actually shed tear.  tired CaNcEl cUlTuRe. Take tax dollars state suck. would great time strong actual unions. Imagine general strike, refusing work customers masked... lose weight, healthy. worry much. waited 6 hours Covid test. I‚Äôll wait twice vaccine.  imagine 4th July actually feel like patriotic accomplishment. Thank almost every liberal know that's reddit ready open too. edgy teens twenty something's life want endless lockdowns lmao. much attributed lack effectiveness concept restrictions masks much attributed inability people comply restrictions?

If feel like restrictions masks helping control spread corona think causing decrease cases? explain difference spread countries like China supposedly much stricter compared spread America? mouth wrote checks campaign body can‚Äôt cash...? absolutely. vital avoid toxic folks and, dealing issues, social media often amplifies negative (gets clicks). 

Speaking Christakis, dude part one original studies this: Except we're rapidly approaching situation going political battle.

For flaws, absolute load they're like nearly nothing flaws, Republican party part ""going back normal"" right now....so mistake assume political is.

I'm left leaning, Biden came today said need social distance another year two, likely would drastically change next vote. impossible call political.  great news! let's rest! gladly see stupid pandemic end, able avoid international travel. pressing needs traveling overseas. article October. yet, like said it‚Äôs really worse elsewhere Yeah I'm gonna try get tested friday.

That would 12 days since exposure week since started minor symptoms follow Clay Jenkins updates news regarding hospitalizations awhile, see poster said true. awhile Dallas significant sub 50 year old hospitalizations, many making ICU. Well duh. difference vaccines ‚Äúavailable‚Äù administering them. wonder might happen interim? logic defies me. not? using doublespeak also ones claiming censorship comparing situation 1984... really baffling Realistically, herd immunity achieved around August September. It‚Äôs October 2020. brief pauses around unexplained health issues trial participants. figured going continued trials. What‚Äôs goal now? Curve flattened... Prime Minister Australia actually said [basically time last year...

The day-to-day virus response mostly ended falling onto state premiers, although federally temporary increase social security, payment employers keep people 'attached' jobs. Sup, 1999. 

Btw lit teacher TOTALLY boinking cute ""overdeveloped"" Polish exchange student. specially interested ""Mathematical Modeling P1"" second article, says either P1 little cross-immunity significant higher infection rate (or mix between).

Basically, P1 harder hitting covid variable capable restarting waves season populations would normally level immunity older COVID Variants. get watch Texas it‚Äôs masks kids school vs California next two months see matters. Yes can. HEB instance mask mandate Abbott   Define ""communist mind control device"" communism relevant here. pharmaceutical companies privately owned take private profits, that's nowhere near communism according some, we're already depression. employment reports read, they're right.

also, automation gonna keep making numbers bigger. Cara Brasil t√° entre os tr√™s piores paises mundo 

N√£o pode usar n√∫meros absolutos ou per capita como se fossem determinantes

Por exemplo Brasil tem 2% da popula√ß√£o com mais de 80 anos enquanto Europa tem em m√©dia 7% com mais de 80.

Agora imagina quantas mortes Brasil teria se tivesse 3x mais de popula√ß√£o na faixa et√°ria com maior taxa de mortalidade

Al√©m disso tem quest√£o de distribui√ß√£o geogr√°fica, Brasil tem popula√ß√£o mais dispersa que maioria dos pa√≠ses da Europa

E por √∫ltimo quest√£o da testagem Brasil testo 1/5 habitantes enquanto na Europa tem pais que j√° testou 1/1

Da√≠ vem gente dizer que B√©lgica t√° pior pq worldometer parece t√° pior
Compara Brazil com B√©lgica √© compara ma√ß√£ com banana 

Tem um economista que tentou isolar todos os efeitos e projetar mortes caso todos os pa√≠ses fossem iguais (faixa et√°ria , popula√ß√£o...)

O Brasil s√≥ ficava na frente Peru 

Essa √© nossa situa√ß√£o e pior t√° por vir 3k de morte por dia est√£o projetando Quit bullshit! First, vaccine flu children. 

Second:

[According American Academy Pediatrics Children‚Äôs Hospital Association, U.S. children represent 13% COVID-19 cases.

However, children become severely ill COVID-19. might need hospitalized, treated intensive care unit placed ventilator help breathe, according Centers Disease Control Prevention (CDC). addition, children underlying conditions, obesity, diabetes asthma, higher risk serious illness COVID-19.

Rarely, children might also develop serious condition appears linked make 1% 3.6% total reported COVID-19, hospitalizations, 0.6% 6.9% child COVID-19 cases resulted seems spread easily influenza virus (the flu) respiratory viruses. COVID-19 causes serious illnesses people flu. takes longer people show symptoms COVID-19, people contagious longer. (That‚Äôs testing, quarantine isolation important.) There‚Äôs flu vaccine readily available easily accessible. Though Food Drug Administration approved two safe effective COVID-19 vaccines emergency use, several months vaccines widely available public, we‚Äôre still waiting additional data including young children, develop COVID-19. Many symptoms. get sick tend experience milder symptoms low-grade fever, fatigue, cough. children severe complications, less common.

I assure J&amp;J vaccine I‚Äôm going shooting turn comes. vaccine that‚Äôs 65% effective get approved first place? California, big chunk burn last summer, regularly shuts power, also botched vaccine deliveries.

Not mention record cases &amp; deaths.

But hey, reddit loves bash Texas.

(I‚Äôve lived both.)

Edit: folks forget North Dakota Iowa already dropped mandates well.

Wishing Texan right now. incompetent fool Wolf open longer imagine. need save face offering opinion, fact, opinion almost mine anyway. even understand arguments, you? covid death. myriad problems may chronic, including heart, lung, brain problems. I‚Äôm glad texas hope rest states follow lead. Oh no, willing vaccinated. huge percentage population refused vaccine. No, give away, like USAID, try earn good countries want political allies. China Russia thing. Florida 5%* right desantis ended restrictions, positivity rate started increasing basically immediately made 14% bit holidays. came back down, 6%ish think.  ¬Ø\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

Also wait start working again? I've read people heart issues covid pretty concerning long take get vaccine arms? want two. know I‚Äôm going finally get it‚Äôs going Johnson Johnson one.

Media government can't that, check Walmart clear. Hes talking version vaccine next year. dont think 1 vaccine good forever? comes goes. Cases 1k 2k, ballpark UK level well now, although lockdown looser here. One thing keep mind nature wave, suddenly spectacularly over. 

Good point hospital admissions, would.also suggest caveat. Belgians taken hospital quicker UK simply be. NHS must still dealing aftermath enormous second wave, whereas Belgian system time normalize again. vaccines individual cure children can't get yet. want normalcy, let's make sure jump gun. exactly problem people choice?  really enjoy film TV! Certified cinephile.

I live large city, I'm luck. I'm college, makes little tough.

You know right money how-to. here. recently start going work I‚Äôve one vaccine dose, haven‚Äôt store since February. Haven‚Äôt eaten - even take out. don‚Äôt want someone breathing food. husband high risk extra worries. grocery curbside pick up. miss friends much. weeks second dose immunity. faceshield work! Can‚Äôt wait. I‚Äôll still double mask, doesn‚Äôt bother me. Pfizer US company, vaccine production within US restricted. Pfizer also producing Europe, doses don‚Äôt restrictions.  \^ 100% this. Greg Abbott deflecting rightful, anti-right-wing criticism mishandling recent snowstorms...he team taken several notes Ron DeSantis CPAC 2021: ""America Uncanceled"". anything looking CDC data comparitvely? point unempathetic dunderhead contrarian reason think better people? Concert audio engineer here, retire. People acting like Florida hasn‚Äôt existed past month  huge percentage people refuse get vaccinated. Throughout history people always responded pandemic done. Put simply, party. 

It roaring 20‚Äôs part II  Read book stop reading stars. listen actually, thanks assuming. find reasoning sufficient. Would mind elaborating opinions though? Un-brainwash me, will. mean like 2-3 weeks? Look data stop watching tv GME HOLD I'm lifelong Texan moving Seattle end summer. could excited. Right. I‚Äôm agreement Bama football one, everyone offered vaccine chance get one, restriction gathering socialization bodily autonomy totally unethical. reach point well sept, June July restrictions rescinded. people choose continue distance mask etc personal choice. I‚Äôm eligible 1B group California (education). I‚Äôm nervous I‚Äôll get turned away vaccine appointment tomorrow.

I can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs actually happening feels good true. know, Japan‚Äôs temperature comparable said Florida man offered host Olympics Japan wouldn‚Äôt. true!  Nice work living namesake July 4th going lit ever history nation. did. donald decided would look bad told everyone ignore it. 

Turns that's viable plan. Looking graphs phase 3 study, 10 days, minimum, get protection, ramping that. Maybe archdiocese several others around world, Vatican definitely saying ""don't get vaccinated aborted tissues."" Friendly reminder warmer planet results frequent zoonotic transmission events.

You misspelled China. problem, people say ""extend lockdowns, keep businesses closed!"" comfortable work home job making amount money pre-covid times, without understanding millions people making considerably less money 1 whole year! 

I understand call Gov. Abbott may little early, looking starting ease restrictions. Oh believe lie, bet also believe vaccine like Biden claimed Florida summer? BRUTALLY hot humidity extremely unpleasant  long term damage anxiety. course anxiety high right now, anxious stressed time lives, probably since WWII. isn‚Äôt ‚Äújust‚Äù anxiety. Anxiety, depression loneliness serious quite severe right now. Unfortunately doesn‚Äôt power order states anything regard!

The article seems read ‚Äúchallenging‚Äù states this! know reason is, really exhausting! personal opinion everybody continue wear masks social distance everybody wants vaccine received reach peak immunity whole. I'm advocating lockdowns, avoiding friends family private (especially vaccinated), anything like that... please continue wear mask social distance public. whatever activities want! wearing mask really inconvenience people much? act like end world. anyone else think it‚Äôll actually beneficial allow people ‚Äúshop‚Äù kind vaccine want?

If someone wants effective vaccine, period...they go Moderna/Pfizer.

If someone either skeptical mRNA technology, wants convenience single shot, doesn‚Äôt want intense side effects, etc...they go J&amp;J.

Seems like good situation increase amount people getting shot(s) US. social anxiety introversion thing. kind liked ‚Äúif want $1400 stimulus check get vaccinated‚Äù idea know would never pass No, going get absolutely nothing troubles. N. O. T. H. I. N. G. going get kicked curb two ruined wasted years lives absolutely nothing show whatsoever. never priority pandemic. one forcing you. Keep living life want live. Looks like Texas may next state another spike... may large it'll likely larger most. think fucking know that? last remaining grandparent died seen whole time. surgery, alone recovery room, mostly alone home unable even go outside own. can't walk house unassisted all, medically necessary spend days bed weeks. think that's fucking isolating know tell you. 


What telling pandemic costs God damn many lives people's shit decisions. cunty comment? Fuck  problem lot us believe anymore, they've lost credibility.

Want know expert I'll respect? one says ""yeah couple months now, virus control we're going accept us reopen normal""

Why? that'd truth. yours! I. Gotta. Jibboo. Too. Wow, people least stable social work circles affected events making difficult meet people? Mind blown. That's long takes fudge numbers? Damn. least state, since vaxx centers use online signups moved random lotteries browser, captchas, ways avoid site overload, hard 65+ navigate. become popular younger computer savvy folks 'adopt' senior go dozens appontmen sites throughout day them.

For example, mega vaccination site release 5000 appointments every days know navigate forms extremely quickly chance, twitter bot alert new signups available., go 3-4 minutes. mean that‚Äôs exactly voted wheres problem? you‚Äôre saying YOLO stocks October 2029 hold line save economy?  45% Cool, everyone wants vaccine one. Nerd lot whiffed. Operation warp speed funded 6 companies vaccine attempts. far three approved. Theoretically AZ get approval, throw shit wall see sticks mentality. People back didn‚Äôt modern technology allows us communicate others afar entertain home. Staying home boring. impressive full year gone still learned anything ""please stay away family Christmas spring""

That'll next. call jobtitle STIKO german organisation recommended use AZ vaccine people older 65 18 members, 13 professors. 17 doctors. STIKO‚Äòs sole purpose make vaccination related recommendations. Almost.... vulnerable populations fully vaccinated quite soon, must wait every individual opportunity get vaccine allowed ease restrictions. dose vaccine! Thankfully studies already coming show vaccine fact reduce transmission. next 2 3 months much data people receive vaccince. yall probably end month behind. although started slow, youll probably one first fully vaccinated countries world still. I‚Äôve thinking depression/anxiety. They‚Äôre contagious sense. like Florida may need giant ass buildings offices that.

**Additional Thoughts/Cool Stuff**

Testing Positivity Rate: said lot subs positivity rate go time people vaccinated require testing. Last year, *the* metric watch, likely wane quickly importance overall testing drops. necessarily worry sudden high positivity rates, mass testing likely drop pretty quickly, particularly testing sites converted vaccination sites. 

We may want use newly found testing sequencing capacity test sequence higher proportion flu samples. might give us head start flu genetics circulating, help eliminate flu two. We're single digits flu cases places, awesome! likely cheaper vaccine made redditor.

[A happy may prevent severe [mRNA vaccines 100% SA variant, *doesn't* [mean we'll definitely need like [thegracefuldork's prediction vaccine previous prediction. ""rosier"", better.

**Which vaccine get?**

When someone asks favorite beer is, answer always same.

It's one front me.

So get first vaccine can, differences pretty minor.

**Booster questions think about, answers**

(note: there's difference ""boost"" ""booster"" needs understood.)

(also, what's term mixture sequences, heterogenous? doubt term overthinking?)

(also also, I'm convinced we're definitely going need boosters, fun think about.)

Could booster shot replace second dose prime/boost regimen?

Should booster shot use one sequence mRNA (or identical spike proteins), both/multiple?

For future vaccines, sequence/spike prime/boost different? four spikes/sequences, would make sense two each, four each?

How much trust mutation modeling here? anticipate future mutations include them? good enough yet?

Do need give non-booster doses people recovered infection?

Could ""stretch"" doses mRNA booster priming vaccine that's easier manufacture, maybe less effective (like ChAdOx1), boost mRNA booster? Could better faster prime current mRNA sequence boost updated ChAdOx1? Could maybe [this US?]( vaccines reduce infections, someone gets infection getting vaccinated, fewer reduced symptoms. currently seems also true post vaccination infection known variants. pretty sure reduction indication they'll reduce spread. Why? We're pretty sure reduce spread people truly asymptomatic barely spread virus, people mild symptoms spread slightly more, people go develop severe symptoms spread virus really well. 

In words: reduction symptoms least correlated reduction ability spread virus. Vaccines reduce symptomatic infections symptoms get infected. Therefore, vaccines reduce spread.

If people develop immunity via clearing infection, subsequent variant exposed broaden immune response, likely without disease (symptoms). they'll good broad immunity variety variants, seems likely indication catch spread virus well future. thing happens someone vaccinated exposed new variant. immunity broadened strengthened subsequent exposure, likely without symptoms. remember, many people less likely spread virus, pretty unlikely reduced level spread sufficient sustain virus way seen past year. variant becomes somewhat widespread, it'll hit resistance pretty quickly. become widespread, Yay!

I'm totally willing mind changed new information though, take gospel.

This exaggeration.

There incredibly complex vast differences someone 65 someone 25. People act like immunocompromised death sentence. not. one many risk factors. know 70yo heavily immunocompromised mild case covid example. 

Think it.. reason one 40 died city 1 million despite countless immunocompromised young people getting covid. Almost 1200 deaths elderly. Tens thousands infected We‚Äôre screwed. Everyone able vaccine end May ‚Äî position Brazil. Party time! nuclear option increased health insurance premiums  Well yes also no. state prepared something happened since 1949. Texas got unlucky year. said state could done better job enforcing existing preparation guidelines. hospitals Brazil biggest city approaching peak capacity. country brink huge health system collapse.   «ù∆É∆É 8, 2021 ‚Äî United States *in 'eye hurricane*' (Osterholm)

Still amazing comment gets type reactions read said ...

Did read comment *where quoted you*?

Anyway, think misread original comment. didn‚Äôt say reinfections spiking usual ‚Äî *I said they‚Äôre reinfected Brazilian variant*. 

You agree me.

I also said variant known contagious. ... linked several sources showing much. lockdown useless destroyed economy alongside it. fucked up. Rights granted government. need protected government. read cell immunity means worry $$$$ Sounds like Texas government policies resulted current standing vaccine rollout then. Maybe directly, indirectly. Really where? 
The virus responding selection pressure evade immunity, even it‚Äôs complete escape yet reason say stop? Oxford vaccine gonna open source. capitalism kicked general question topic I‚Äôm hoping somebody could shed light on. Since cells someone infected recovered would ‚Äúseen‚Äù whole virus, including spike protein, cells people vaccinated (at least Pfizer, moderna, j&amp;j) ‚Äúseen‚Äù spike protein, wouldn‚Äôt stand reason response would better recovered person rather vaccinated? good job modifying spike protein vaccines generate somehow makes response strong stronger even though it‚Äôs less t-cells recognize? Thanks! wasn't. hospital building China early 2020 GOOD NEWS

ONLY DOOM. true. media repeating science reports. 

It sounds like think media report information somehow verify things qualified to. 

Here good news story vaccines working COVID variants CNN last month. Trump fueled bullshit lies. Since one actually read article asking questions easily answered Kenya received 1 million doses COVID-19 vaccine **first batch** global COVAX initiative created ensure low- middle-income countries fair access minister said vaccines administered 400,000 medical workers rest go frontline workers teachers police officers. well things reopen May June, people less reason mad him. Florida completely open months cases deaths declining rate rest country. expect cases especially hospitalizations deaths continue decline Texas, wait weeks know sure. Fear! scared! Everyone going die! Well, developed mild symptoms - soreness + fever one case. Pretty sure legit. anyyyy idea got covid even lot vigilance? Good, feed starving children went without food due global lockdowns. people walk around naked public Mississippi want to? Hey, im complaining. I'm saying wierd hear actually places completely shut states. went bank ""wait tell safe enter"", like, ""Wait, states doing?"" fucking wierd. get tested every month work. Anybody similar situation show up. (I imagine lots, common job). people really getting infected think would seen signs kind workers. Every measure implemented late little warning. Everything changes literally daily basis. people can, small businesses closed months hotspots big factories still open, rules social distancing required testing.

I‚Äôm sure prime minister owns huge number factories merely coincidence. Definitely beats heck guessing! develop vaccines, put rovers Mars, build skyscrapers, defend borders, keep homes warm winter. Well, unless Texas. skipped last part.  vaccinated April naive believe otherwise. 

Or, accurately, made part attempt promote mistrust AZ vaccine spreading misinformation. wonder many hundreds people die refuse vaccine would protected them. Based we‚Äôve seen several states removing restrictions we‚Äôre still much tail end pandemic, don‚Äôt see happening, least US. swear sister's friend T-virus back December. longer think Arm employees water guns, giant disclaimer refuse masks squirt you! Seriously, sounds stupid but, people refusing. Yes unprepared, typically get snow every 10 years decide shut whenever happens since cheaper stay home snow melts buy bunch snowplows.

The bigger problem power plants froze over. designed vent heat summer meant properly insulated winter conditions. Anyone know get hard data Texas post-opening? I‚Äôm hopeful better many think push country reopen (albeit gradually).  going get accustomed living it.

And living mean living like constantly need high alert 24/7 way now, that's message needs stressed. talk ""new normal"" looks like. look like wearing mask night club taking get inside? (This Wuhan, China btw) look like low-capacity restaurants distanced tables? mean countries high vaccination rates start adopting measures similar places like South Korea Taiwan New Zealand? 

If giving people concrete idea ""new normal"" actually look like, leaves free put place whatever scary, irrational ideas want. read said, beyond normal levels? reinfections OG Covid. discussing mass reinfection. evidence it, none. 
That study sourced: widely debunked see: article sourced, based modelling study based widely debunked serosurvey see man whose job validate studies: thousands, scheme level infection- minor. driving force human catastrophe Brazil South Africa, less sexy cause: poverty, lack resources inequity. really good business? select business? doc saying Seattle, introverted city US. People bathing loneliness pandemic provides. east coast progressive, left kinda wacky people ive able talk 2 minutes wouldnt mind locking till summer 2022 vaccinated country... Go figure! real world efficacy AZ Pfizer / Moderna extremely similar. 

I would expect JnJ. Take get move along. Yeah, time I'll wear one get flu something want give others.  December 2020?!?! state government unprepared? Surely received expert advice regarding prepared, consistent local conditions. accept recommendations take action?  Assuming everybody show crowded space together...   SMBC predicted back seriousness, much doubt anyone willing live like past year every winter.  like ""absence evidence"" vaccinations preventing spread somehow ""evidence inverse,"" ie vaccines prevent spread. get risk aversion mindset benefits, downsides too. 

 No, absence evidence absence evidence now?  segment last Friday, Senator Tester Ezra Klein part panel discussion topics. Must Texas done poorly Covid deaths... oh wait, hasn‚Äôt (at least US standards) Weird. Americans want global record 1 million deaths. Say even louder, friend! !muchas felicidades! I‚Äôll get flu shot stay home I‚Äôm sick. Maybe I‚Äôll even wear mask go sick. way hell keeping current mitigation measures covid...for flu. Abbott one dumb mf....smfh.

Mask mandate gone Memorial Day weekend 4th wave ended spilled glass water lol learned? that? dont know learning /s teachers pretty high risk, they're still lower risk old people Phase 3 already includes thousands participants. Including healthcare workers, extreme risk COVID exposure, India did, likely saved far lives potential negative side effects phase 3 trials.

Phase 3 trials main goal efficacy. Although might rare side effects found large scale, safety issues dealt far prior phase 3. Remember Phase 3 trial general public, better known quite safe moves anywhere close phase 3 trials.

People act like giving phase 3 vaccines healthcare workers horrible unscientific thing. take data driven approach, risks covid likely greatly outweighs risk Phase 3 trial vaccine, healthcare workers. Also remember healthcare workers get sick, entire healthcare system becomes risk. 

As far read, healthcare workers free refuse vaccine wished to, option open risking families lives, good approach? speak german... perfect use much since child. pander teachers unions  paid sick leave Italian here, 100% agree. Fucking SAN MARINO going faster us atm, since could order Sputnik vaccines. EU holding members back. Already waiting 'How make covid vaccine home episode 1' youtube videos. Good job India. bc thin cloth masks wear constantly fidget touch reposition faces jack crap limit spread pathogen.
PA got smacked harder second go around bc early days, health department warning take precaution.
The village live saw literally date 5 cases.
No hospitalizations.
Warren saw 40.
Erie think still around 400 some.
The majority cases came Allegheny co.and Philly.
The majority PA rural.
So say overwhelmingly, that's mean. Everyone hyped summer comments, asked expect everything return normal Biden says something along lines ""We want say, expect end 2022"". start making bunch plans year yet people unless ready disappointed.  decision approved coronavirus. got first dose. Takes little kick in. 

It‚Äôs easier recommend restrictions like clear end date, soon. going jump say ordered KN95s one company listed article (Bona fide Masks dot com) reading them, seem really solid. cold live outside virtually visible breath escaping sides/top. realized exactly A-1 scientific analysis least lot better regard paper masks using via visual analysis. think paid 9.95 pack ten reusable least awhile. Based wording, got first dose. Immunity immediate. Well say get 2nd dose still. official advice 2 weeks 2nd shot.

But trial data shows 2 weeks 1st shot (moderna/pfizer least, havent seen j&amp;j's) almost fully protected Diagnosed COPD 15. Horrifying. EU needs reformed splitting bunch little nation states realistic. EU needs federalism, direct elections, end principle unanimity stops anything real happening. Stores jurisdictions.   5‚Äô8 weigh 197 pounds obese. Sounds like qualify. Dude, mom got vaccine - doesn‚Äôt *any* that. going cause another spike. Noooooo don‚Äôt wanna go back office!!! 65+ still vaccinated though

Going many vaccines done Canada, many still vaccinated all. needs to. point large amount us vaccinated, need ones end it. States tiptoe around safe people haven‚Äôt gotten vaccine don‚Äôt want it. That's realistic solution given last year, we've seen plenty evidence kind people passionate wearing masks overlap heavily kind people willing shoot underpaid employee asking wear mask. sounds like hypocrisy. Cinemark program lets rent whole theater bring 20 people. also selection older movies book it. Wife saw Empire Strikes Back birthday, us. 24 year old teacher getting vaccine 75 year old obese cancer survivor basically murdering people. Nice! still leaves risk factors hands individual. 

If you‚Äôre comfortable around maskless people, go places mask mandates. 

This simple. Stupidity, especially new data coming UK. glad abbott restrictions, fine businesses whatever want  course say things like ""overwhelmingly"" mean much since masks social distancing introduced right pandemic started Pennsylvania early state besides New York California. like trying disprove masks social distancing saying ""despite this, got smashed"" makes sense. book Tiny Tim cover band still there! Can't wait club shows again. Brazil earned honor.  daughter‚Äôs best friend going - six years old. dad doesn‚Äôt believe her. SARS MERS dangerous coronaviruses one neither widespread enough motivate big push. got close SARS died funding dried result. people get it: [a band named ""All Time Low"" made Ah, got it. Hopefully, get vaccinated soon. wife nurse already vaccinated. work Missouri, lumped teachers reason. interesting working mostly home, kids school since September. 

Good luck wife.  Yes, cardiac rehab program mainly physiotherapy. already psychotherapist working together trauma therapies, may see psychiatrist. done diet counseling large contributing factor (I blood platelet clotting disease), significantly cut saturated fats salts nonetheless. 

Sometimes think group therapy would help anything ‚Äúgroup‚Äù really hard right now! waited 16 hours. Couldn‚Äôt wait longer. say it‚Äôs okay take before. Tylenol better ibuprofen you‚Äôre concerned. Definitely. interpreted as: Baker already gave green light CVS. seems truth somewhere between, going content article. going announced part package measures 17 March. yet implemented misleading say merely proposed (based article). lifting restrictions (not like Texas), show vaccine end game, people motivated get vaccinated. everything stays same, deters people getting vaccinated.

Many people want get vaxxed return normal. Great news. know many vaccines could pump weekly? Ok, going keep increasing supply? Novavax isn‚Äôt likely approved May. prepare come guns blazing?

Surely J&amp;J improve production Merck comes online.

Also, it‚Äôs Pandemic still need vaccinate several billion people. really much considering Trump administration jack shit came vaccine distribution. India truly impressing throughout pandemic far, they‚Äôve got issues country rapidly proving world-class. call ""taking seriously"" Bolsonaro done do?

Decree state siege put army enforce curfews, arrest street vendors ID number right day demand forms walk streets like neighbors did?

Looking raw worldometer data, even difficulty compare, Brazil outstanding Latin American context much harsher measures. impossible argue heavy handed lockdowns neighbors resulted better numbers justified social, economic health costs lockdowns.

We extreme authoritarian rules neighbors far worse did. reasonable trade.

Even ultra authoritatian Panama worldometer similar S√£o Paulo. would make people unable get vaccine sad Interesting, thanks. know everyone succeeded, little surprised find one giants get far tiny companies I'd never heard of. live Louisiana open since September. district,, constantly people, classes, grade levels, (more rarely) whole schools quarantining 2 weeks bc cases. school worked going virtual completely shut once, various classes grade levels quarantined several times. 

I say last week data showed steady decline reported cases schools. really mean another 2 3 months.

Yeah, excuse us believing anymore tricked us longest 2 weeks human History long island right impossible get vaccine anywhere even 65+. Apparently pharmacy calling anyone who‚Äôs system end night extra doses. Here‚Äôs hoping call up! wife joking day! 

Somehow, every single Chick-fil-A staff capable handling number drive-through vehicles would make fast food joints crumble. 3 cars wide wrapping around building block still end waiting 10 minutes. good news coming top company. likely management back. about, instead bitching Texas, proactive protecting loved ones. mom Texas, got vaccine. can‚Äôt change Texas‚Äô policy, tell mom upgrade mask next month, get grocery delivery, hold little longer (until second dose) socializing not. It‚Äôs one month MONTHS NOW. Sorry don‚Äôt buy anymore. disastrous December distributions disprove directly. 

Easily exceeding expectations espouses efficiency Everything's bigger Texas, including governor's stupidity.

Ending mask mandate gonna get people sick killed. I'm 30 would like shot dad 64. think priority based age. would suck sudden free young people like got didnt low key bit worried. got approved 210k loan house 10% down, make 60k good field 60k student loan debt. think take cheaper house though. got approval email reminded scene big short realized bubble stripper owned 5 houses. Good point‚ÄîI looking adult population, total population. Iowa dropped mask mandate early February.

They gone wrong direction. P.1 isnt less pronouncible covid-19 know, there‚Äôs lot people presently eligible unable get due lack appointment availability. Sounds like Dolly didn‚Äôt use celebrity status gain advantage, respect. abstract basically says all. 2.2-2.8x reduction antibody efficiency; compare 4-6x sa variant. threatens antibody cocktails unlikely impact current vaccines. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

Pharmacies/pharmacists still need get normal work pharmacy done safe manner.

If first try  I‚Äôm saying shouldn‚Äôt get sort priority, shouldn‚Äôt get priority high risk individuals likely die covid.  high risk teachers would get vaccinated high risk category too. already looking forward getting vaccinated, I'm super excited. Please read majority people mean all.
Simply bc see percent population protesting friends family represent maybe best five percent PA's population.

People bad psychological tendency see small (what appears large groups them) assume life like everywhere.
PA one largest states Union, fairly large population rural rest areas like Philly PGH.

Nothing sorry about... can't imagine feeling firsthand honestly.

Do plan wear mask annually flu season save lives? much monumental burden you? like abortion laws right? least texas Republicans inconsistent else Great Gatsby.  media doesn‚Äôt necessarily understand humoral immunity. see ‚Äúzomg antibodies don‚Äôt work‚Äù Covishield efficacy 60% despite front runners months throwing numbers 80-90%.So going worse way. long causes harm people took nothing wrong trusting scientists.

Its like random company started garage last year.DGI asked data provided them. I'm glad see places barring illegal immigrants getting vaccine.

I understand anyone plain anti-vaccine vaccinating everyone. apparently know vaccines effective needed. think illegal immigrant going go, ""Well, shit, can't get vaccine, time pack go back Honduras!"" kids extremely unlikely spread covid? would think essential retail workers first.  Don‚Äôt give hope. time read something like next negative thing read ruins day. I‚Äôm strong enough hope yet. 

My best chance accepting going forever trying endure it, pleasantly surprised end. [Ah yes, right. realize done  Noteworthy cited study n=43, meaning individual persons swing results multiple percentage-points Won‚Äôt somebody think enjoyment? screw title bad enough, better delete start over.

Something covid (no matter bad introverts, antisocials, teenagers, face dysmorphics may want to) never able achieve. Covid delayed world. 9/11 changed it. know enough data predict confidence interval, since mention many interim sample *didn't* get Covid.

At 95% confidence, population 25800, would need sample size 96 ¬±10%pts, 379 ¬±5%pts. sample sizes need big. Remember, includes positive negative Covid cases.  Ad-hominem attacks counter-productive fact-based discourse. merely state: 1) whatever hidden implications saw original comment 2) thesis supporting evidence. Good. Fuck'em. Sinovac give 100M dose Turkey August. 13.5M shipped. Turkey also buy 30M dose BionTech vaccine. Bu know mudi evil :) Maybe letting vaccinated only? know unvaccinated folks would get angry, there's much businesses days safe! Asymptomatic spread extremely rare though. vaccinated person 10% likely show symptoms risk spread almost nonexistent. one clumsy headline.  sounds kinda silly since groups likely die catch know even 2 months, matter situation, people going upset things open go back normal. also coming one year anniversary ""15 days stop spread."" Source Biden's travel orders?

I know Airlines require it, thought something implemented almost year ago.  godawful messaging vaccine helped either. states differentiate obese morbidly obese (starts 40.0) allow latter count. Morbid obesity (sometimes called severe obesity) would start 265 pounds someone 5'8"". want breed vaccines become ineffective. Wild. can't believe seemingly vast majority americans want carry usual like nothing amiss. condolences.  Understood, sorry man, really tough times right now.  Y'all wanna leave vaccines rest us aswell? Like virtually vaccines. give fuck one, give shot, vaccine. Yeah I‚Äôm still eagerly waiting Super Bowl spike. It‚Äôll day, let‚Äôs keep fingers crossed! ü§û gone eat week indoors outdoors (when weather permitted latter). get takeout day cook simply don‚Äôt want waste time driving restaurants hoping find one without massive wait. lot people eating county again, even Sunday night couple weeks ago 20-minute wait. it‚Äôs unusual go Saturday see full parking lots long waitlists. far know outbreaks county traced restaurant. 

The restrictions don‚Äôt keep going restaurants things (like 15-20% capacity events depending whether they‚Äôre indoors outdoors) choose they‚Äôre less restricted. I‚Äôm going go baseball game July, example, wear mask high humidity whole time. don‚Äôt want go partial capacity hockey game indoors experience would watered down. said, lots people seem want go, power them. 7% number bit misleading. 

Yes, 7% vaccinated. state 29 million people, also 2.6 million cases (~9%). asymptomatic cases can't truly quantified.

There overlap (recovered cases also got vaccinated), number people antibodies protecting likely much higher 7%.  caught ten pounds fatness pandemic. yeah that's big difference. J&amp;J 60% symptoms like 85% serious symptoms 100% far hospitalizations deaths. Hopefully 81% symptoms extremely low risk death serious disease (hospitalization). would happen someone follow directions one dose first shot within period days? interested, planning thing, occurred someone could wondering effect could have? someone signed different first shots within days? Would create stronger response? known would happen? Cant blame people. government lied them. dont trust government, look information elsewhere

Take French government example. Last March enough masks do? told French people masks useless. French people trust government say vaccines safe? That's mRNA vaccine, hold true AstraZeneca/Oxford one, too?  Georgia, 8th. fully protected mean much 50-80% protected within 2-3 weeks first dose according lot data we‚Äôve seen far

Not say shouldn‚Äôt still careful, wouldn‚Äôt fault anyone decided relax little COVID restrictions couple weeks first dose. People burned damn pandemic Thank you! SA variant reduction antibody efficiency, people stop talking it? two weeks...right? Holden going breakdown one notices late. That's plot. worrying missed that. Sorry buddy, brainwashed Huh must missed decree ban masks Texas. 

People free wear masks please. obese old people often live young people, that's whole problem ""Let healthy people live lives! argument!"" every young person house apartment. Shush.. let facts dumb shit like R factor get way good story, break circle jerk.

For real I've seen sub get stupider stupider, anything that's good news propped up, everything that's even slightly pessimistic outlook, even valid dismissed. Right, vaccine turned effective mean ok approve trials complete. title makes sound like people criticized decision even though absolutely Rip Something something failure greatest teacher. yet Governor's mansion still closed tours! crazy.  83.5% still fantastic number.  


This great news world! need responsible citizens care vulnerable children.

I would shocked restrictions place long, let's take one step time. lot kids getting sick chronic illness injury result, would probably good extra precautionary measures place safe too. course always outliers, overall scheme things, think numbers statistically insignificant! us finally able proper burial loved ones lost COVID. I'll finally able bury mom early June nearly year since passed away.

But yeah, we're definitely looking forward ""best summer time"" pretending like Florida doesn‚Äôt exist? Hear hear. upside, EU enough non-AZ vaccines September give people get AZ now. Also, thanks low numbers people vaccinated AZ EU, SA variant might pick fast - unlike UK. importantly, proof vaccination already required travel number places. seems like another unnecessary giveaway stadium convention center owners. gonna learn? stadium treatment centers accepted tiny number patients.

How continue distribute vaccines become available small outlets? Instead dog pony show giveaways? court would super strike down. Discrimination need infect others. Yeah shit , point competent government would give financial aid normal people. Im struggling X times infectious means?

First off, despise BJ. He's con artist, professional liar, complete fake, knows convince people otherwise telling like hear. 

Secondly, wonder many people die AZ vaccine gives false long term security. notion speculation point, genuinely think grave problem. 

The way see it, AZ vaccine compares mRNA vaccines writing book type writer compares writing computer. occasion, AZ could compete Oxford University already typed draft version advance. new chapters need written (ie. booster shots), able move speed Pfizer Moderna. That's I'd rather part story. want wait studies tell Pfizer booster shot also work received AZ vaccine. would require masks? students faculty vaccine then. file bankruptcy? Since got one, I'm thinking getting ""booster"" pfizer/moderna one fall. then, ample vaccines. I'll visit USA get get one pfizer ones show efficacy variants.

I'm Caribbean country called dominican republic   Probably safe assumption anti-maskers believe COVID-19 big deal likely get infected due taking risks like crowded social gatherings. ""People need live lives."" constantly say. feel like would skipped semester two, given current state world.

There another issue people talking much: jobs. Anyone graduating going hit one worst job markets ever, going take many years recover. defer year, competing two years new grads well unemployed experience pool jobs. Defer two years competing even larger pool. thing happened 2008. want think possibility something contagious reopening could offset much vaccine's protection. company declared bankruptcy today sold. top company longer top company, we'll wait see stick this. heard that, turns load shit. depends. They're saying prior covid + 1 shot provides strongest immunity. La Jolla virologists also saying yet seen immunity better (natural vaccine). Everyone get vaccinated case though. Lol people don‚Äôt spend much time outside would think especially summer. Money talks. They'll come around rest country does.    Shelter place 'proof' vaccine ticket this. I'm exactly sure proof looking beyond already know vaccine, you.

Don't expect everyone else to.  *Via reporter Rachel Leingang:*

Gov. Doug Ducey ordered schools must return in-person learning month, saying ""students need back classroom.""

The move comes year schools initially closed in-person classes help limit spread COVID-19. Since then, decisions reopen largely left hands local districts.

Ducey issued executive order Wednesday calls schools reopen in-person learning March 15, spring break.

More: Yeah vaccine widespread even point masks school? Can't speak others, school imposing isolation (for dorms) even unexposed students, addition 2x/week testing. Sure whole year still excessive IMO Source ? Asking friend Florida relatively high median age would expect death toll much higher. Also death tolls high warm places like Texas SoCal Every adult end May. Nothing approved yet &lt;18.  cases. couple articles - one nurse routinely tested hard bad/borderline severe covid months earlier. tested positive totally asymptomatic second time; noticed smell/taste might bit.  I'm Brazilian. whole year holed home, expected things bit better. no, things seem worse ever getting worse. government failing us continuously. People stubborn unwilling cooperate. I'm exhausted deeply ashamed country become. Claiming people secretly want covid last forever requires proof actually. provided proof companies profited covid still want covid gone though. Based things looking right now, looks like Michigan track start phase 1c mid April. state approaching 50% mark 65+ It'll another month half majority 50+ residents front line workers vaccinated. point, major supply boost, allowing phase 1c individuals get vaccinated rather quickly. expecting open season vaccines general public Memorial Day, pandemic roughly July 4th. understand states moving already vaccinated essential frontline workers risk. day 8 14 jumps 85%? fair, Biden give something concrete timeframe. asked ""100 days mask wearing"" term began. He's like... less half that. can‚Äôt deny toll human life comes broken social support systems economic pain. math net cost determine overall certain NMI measures worth harm, simply deny existence harm closures acknowledging reality. 

If net harm ever tip favor widespread closures society, calculation gets harder harder justify harm Covid wanes vaccination elderly, older adults etc. soon US elderly people want vaccine offered one, 80% demographic died Covid protected possible. continued school closures restricted medical appointments worth cost 80% less deadly virus? 

And doesn‚Äôt even consider calculation closures failed prevent Covid infecting 35-40% Americans. thousands die!


So it.  need redo. They're irreparably damaged. They're ""behind"" administrator's arbitrary schedule. Every year push content lower lower. ridiculous. wife's Third graders learning learned middle school. 

You can't undo parents dieing covid free babysitter could afford food. new state-run mass vaccination sites Savannah, Waycross, Sandersville, Cartersville, Columbus. five sites come online March 17 advance Governor Kemp said would expansion vaccine eligibility state.

This good necessary news, also feel like I‚Äôm game show waiting Kemp spin wheel pick new group  Same. WFH GTFO

I like chatting family much better. Following CDC's guidelines based science emotional? Alrighty then. No, think would notice half million suicides? Wait, Texas reopen then? hell nah good thing cali imo weed, id rather move colorado state avoid bs cali lol.  Wtf wrong Mississippi Texas?
Duh it‚Äôs common sense people going die this. Also cause super spreader event. waited long wait people vaccinated Slowly relaxing restrictions going 100% ham 1/10th country's population. There's leaks weekly cap gonna double 15th March. Come California enjoy able afford anything soul crushing traffic. hey, least weather‚Äôs nice. one, even ask Pretty sure matter cause, tinnitus always permanent. New York City probably international travel hub greatest number visitors US. there's pandemic, going get hit hardest first.  u authoritarian u give control

Who giving control to? benefits? Explain  Covid didnt ruin anything

It politicians virtue signalers decided old timers spend rest lives isolation clear, USCCB National Catholic Center Bioethics clear morally permissible catholics get J&amp;J vaccine, others available (which likely coming months certain places) others preferred. Link it.  recently heard someone blame teachers school closed snow day inclement weather. don‚Äôt know rest live, *not* works here. power teachers way imagined.  definitely sound like steps move forward, actual plan made state way, way earlier Yeah putting stock super easy change guideline sent 5.5 months advance wanting create controversy nothing. Scaring teenagers forms physical contact indeed works prevent spread AIDS, also sorts unintended consequences. lead long term struggle health anxiety. we're seeing play covid. weird feeling people almost cheering COVID. Like, newfound sense authority judgement moral superiority didn‚Äôt before. 

It doesn‚Äôt help messaging insanely shitty. 

Who thought good idea say, ‚ÄúNothing changes even you‚Äôre vaccinated‚Äù? Yep vaccine end yet actions sates. Population population density explain trends, plus adherence lots states guidelines low (studied via cell phone movements, example). Masks quarantines, social distancing work - undeniable proven (and prior pandemic, actually). may dealing now, result people right things, strains covered vaccine - I've speaking since last summer bioinformatics scientist. underplayed quotes pharma executives used evidence strains covered, reality well 4,000 detected strains (and many detected) well numerous jumps species. likelihood vaccine fully cover every strain drops every day people allowing virus spread. Reopening months early could quite literally sabotage efforts entire world past year - could many regions world right things. Mass stupidity virus realize existed numbers, revealed past year. Nearly third half human population complete morons. Dutch love babushkas. Source: Dutch. Also would add around number second third wave already. thing UK mutation accounts 80% cases hospitals starting get overwhelmed. wasnt case second third wave hospitals fine. realize difference purple red tier stay home order right? Like, happen, purple tier police could technically stop ask house.

That tier we're moving of, red still lot restrictions, orange things really get lightened up. means there's everybody else. Same. I'd settle 2 days office week, actively seeking jobs allow working home. huge pay raise able wfh, big lifestyle boost, get sleep hence stay later could theoretically wfh travel, see world without using vacation days. So, schedule 8th, wait till Monday make appointment?  years psychology, tell 100% can't heal stupid. IQ change throughout lifetime. AKA another miserable fun summer awaits.

There's group people want wait see, there's Qanon level crazy people still believe Covid hoax.  always give credit credit due. Texas shitting bed sorts ways; vaccine distribution one them. Even power, likely Texas would closed outdoor vaccination sites. Yeah J&amp;J language inspire much confidence. counts moderate-to-severe, counts severe?   AB, wonder ""A"" part keeps vulnerable, presence ""B"" lowers all. lot people California realized restrictions toothless, people huge house party street last weekend. Yes sirrrrr good news! know haha, refuting point Florida weather = people outside Yep. quite literally easiest brain dead thing keep cases lower. Even things reopen. 

Of course Texas neanderthal room. loss man. Enjoy lockdowns. lancet report. yes is. Stop lying people. articles I've seen seem estimate could hit 4m week production ramp done real. feel like pandemic year putting problems. tried work towards goals it, depressed drained energy/motivation. everyone gets enjoy grand reopening, I'm going spending lot time alone work Covid. I'd wanted come pandemic better person, clear won't, feel lot regret used time anxiety work come.

Going back office going utterly brutal too. I'm already sleep deprived that's gonna amplify 10x. weight wanted lose still here, goes making good second first impression social circle. I'm basically dude started sucks. Joey boy exactly known abilities wordsmith... vaccine available mean ppl get shot. Unfortunately, hold outs.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  Yeah, matters enforcing it. I'm calling lockdowns anything, think we're really positive trajectory need keep genuinely free thing, tragic demoralizing element country thinks cool making bold statements recklessness like this. loathe point history can't cohesive response anything all, even public health crisis, virus affect anyone, regardless political leanings. No. Checks balances

Theres federal law saying states cannot choose open, federal govt jurisdiction Ugh, it‚Äôs exhausting. people high risk categories (ie people), it‚Äôs already safe. I'm good here, thanks. Disappointing, surprise California.  I'm sorry, friend.   want normal life stuff move normal state like Texas Florida police-state restrictions end California. Indiana opened today anyone 50+ indicated wouldnt long started go 40 plus. Things moving right along. predicting mid march wave. hell happened ""thou shall worship false idols"" statue?? Italian here, agree you. 1/3 doses fridge people busy crying EU. Also ridiculous compare Italy San Marino.   premature kind rules regarding fall semester. one knows prevalence like 6 months now. think vary depending location. rural/suburban campuses case rate may drop low admin feels back normal students tested weekly quickly catch &amp; isolate asymptomatic outbreaks. Lol... people still living California insane restrictions? thought sane person would left moved Florida Texas now. reductio ad absurdum. Outside overly cautious medical experts germaphobic people, goal always get 70% vaccinated return normalcy. That's what'll happen. Theres way convince people lockdown 70% got vaccine.  I‚Äôm right you. Nothing 100% certainty, now, we‚Äôve (rightly) making public policy decisions without knowing 100% certain right direction.

But we‚Äôre tail end this, suddenly need 100% certain it‚Äôs safe, need ignore overwhelming ever-increasing evidence yes, vaccines dramatically reduce transmission rates.

It‚Äôs massive double standard people didn‚Äôt ask 100% certainty established lockdowns, asking 100% certainty end them. new vaccines, developed record speed, still appear prevent hospitalizations death even new variants cause infection. That's true vaccinated people 100% immune disease. aren't. 

Let's simplify whole situation demonstrate original point was. Imagine vaccine protects 9 encounters virus tenth one infect you.

In 2050 chance running 10 different people infected virus quite low, therefore chance getting within large group also quite low. Compared today certain people might run dozens even hundreds potentially infected people week, see rates infection among vaccinated would naturally higher today world almost devoid covid. There's going infected amongst vaccinated sheer viral loads loose population not, there's nothing left us.

Vaccines one many tools reduce R0 covid. handy since need get vaccinated work opposed lockdowns require persistent sacrifices. 

We need get infections low enough even restrictions chance exponential growth relatively small. 

The difference normal soon vaccinated normal coast clear matter months US. everyone necessary back February/March 2020 would largely back normal June...but past past. Let's right time, shall we? Neanderthals lived northern europe hundreds thousands years surviving ice age. Texans come close living mark.   ""The present epidemic AIDS originally described homosexual men subsequently intravenous drug abusers, Haitians hemophiliacs""

That's odd sentence. Intravenous drug users make sense, hemophiliacs often get frequent blood transfusions. Homosexual men makes sense era AIDS ripping gay communities. But... Haitians fit in? /whoosh kind point though. think Governor specifically said thinks people continue COVID safety stuff, crisis longer demanded mandate. thing happened 2008.

I graduated 08. worked Wendy's 3 years afterwards... I'm US, could someone please explain me? He's president, can't anything it? Thanks. First Murray, University Washington disease expert whose projections COVID-19 infections deaths closely followed worldwide, changing assumptions course pandemic. brought /r/Charleston /r/SouthCarolina instantly flamed. It‚Äôs shitty messaging around it‚Äôs confusing regular people. people care spread virus too. many actually lose power? per source. Frankly, going break hierarchy within K-12, believe go custodians, Special Ed. teachers, Cafe workers, general population, etc. people holding Easter gatherings put guidelines probably would experts ignored it. hope experts learned happened Super Bowl ignore time.


It‚Äôs human nature people opposite they‚Äôre told don‚Äôt want it? Legit question siblings got sick second dose don‚Äôt really want go cuz I‚Äôve year even super cautious never got covid I‚Äôm young shape doubt would even make super sick. always worried giving loved ones vaccinated. wear masks go I‚Äôve stores every single week last year. surprised? Lol no. someone tourism state protocols abandoned LAST June. People whole damn time I‚Äôve spent year trying parent spread someone high risk. We‚Äôve back work office months us ‚Äúonly days week it‚Äôs okay‚Äù... fuck management. bet ass read news we‚Äôre back office full time vaccines even arms.  antibodies, T-cells home larger portion virus‚Äôs spike, meaning change significantly elude them.

They well point, veered left got completely wrong. 

T cells recognize short snippet protein comprised 8-17 amino acids (called epitope). different size epitope B cell would recognize (15-25 residues). right single amino acid change cell epitope completely block cell recognizing protein. it‚Äôs good news variants circulation *haven‚Äôt* eluded cells, there‚Äôs reason *couldn‚Äôt* evade easily antibodies enough pressure so. person‚Äôs T-cells choose larger sections viral proteins random, also means it‚Äôs harder virus evolve way evades population level. Even finds way trick one person, mean trick person infect.

It‚Äôs entirely random epitopes cells respond to. way cell ‚Äúsees‚Äù protein responds MHC molecules pick hand them. particular version MHC molecule always bind set peptides. lot different versions MHC molecules (these molecule determine transplant organ two people), true immune escape one epitope won‚Äôt effect *everyone*. absolutely limited set epitopes available cells respond epitopes common large swathes people. First Sweden population 10.1M meanwhile Denmark 5.5M people nearly double. Yes per capita higher also densely populated capital deaths occurred. picking numbers like fair comparison. Go capita instead.

You want fair comparison population wise go Sweden 10.1M people 675K cases &amp; 12,964 deaths compared Czechia 10.7M people 1.269M cases &amp; 20,941 deaths. 

(You confirm numbers Worldometers got them)

Sweden failed like NYC virus getting elderly homes masks lockdown would prevented that. sure mention lockdown directly every time people criticise us always didn‚Äôt lockdown deaths high. reality that‚Äôs case see European countries.
Because sub it‚Äôs always Sweden ‚Äúhurr durr‚Äù bad circlejerk I‚Äôm really fucking tired it. I'm sorry came aggressive. Btw read comments implementing mask mandates public transport recommendations we've done last 2 months. countries government mandates people actually generally follow law guidelines government health officials trust them. Nothing see here, move along /s don‚Äôt see point person classes aren‚Äôt even happening states... can‚Äôt students upped list then? I‚Äôm grad student would love go back campus. pretty drastic drop cases Texas mask mandate put place. rise cases happened rise cases pretty much everywhere (which overtook effectiveness masks). I've big arguments family policy (they think good job), somewhat satisfying finally see getting called bullshit. Thank you, know people shouting rooftops awards give would give them. Remember lockdowns supposed 2 weeks? solution jail antivaxxers pandemic. They're attention seekers need alone time. Well Jackson mayor said this. quite honestly wants take political hit putting mask ordinance place city county he's welcome to. live Alabama, state mandate expires Friday gov stated one way another whether going renew it. Jefferson County (where Birmingham is) mandate state guess would issue another one state expired (or maybe currently running I'm sure). end day doubt changes much actual behavior. can't go Costco without mask go eat restaurant indoors 50 unmasked people. high enough me. There‚Äôs effective vaccines there. comfort level anyone else‚Äôs problem own. course. cost anything. Worst case scenario get called early oh well worth try. Best cqse scenario get called early prevent vaccine going bin. Momma's Gotta Jibboo, too! believe exact words ‚Äúget ESSENTIAL job!‚Äù words, learn code good-for-nothing writer. People saying little longer last March completely understand. hand, vaccine time couple months ago genuinely ""just little longer"".


At point though sounds like boy cried wolf. knew vaccine getting showed clinic. Maybe asked scheduled verify. maybe delayed waiting find appointment Moderna. Obviously I‚Äôm speculating don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs issue wanted vaccine helped fund. Risk third virus wave? We're coming third wave right now, tf? believe reference *The Great Gatsby*. College students getting fucked. Already lost 1/4 entire college experience. Well simple sentence skewed public opinion trust good vaccine entire country. mean it‚Äôs pretty easy verify doctor nurse status.

But healthcare workers absolutely right thing prioritize age.

It‚Äôs simple, clear cut, effective.

DeSantis got one right. dont think thats really true anymore. Maybe states problems hear almost every state getting.

Im NY know popped open several 24/7 sites J&amp;J groceries delivered past year? zero contact humans? Maybe, don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs reasonable. limits collectively sacrifice individuals. like jumping bike run last mile tour de France. Unemployed? get new jobüíÖ Realistically fine? It‚Äôs weird seems little early, half vulnerable population vaccinated there‚Äôs basically way they‚Äôll overwhelmed, kinda goal? point. Damn don‚Äôt even care products sourced? Yikes. hope include cleaning staff too.

Signed
Highschool janitor Agreed. new releases every week, tend smaller budget films also, you‚Äôve noted, films released streaming time. I‚Äôm sure impact demand. 

Interestingly Warner films films actually folks cinema (The little thing, Judas black messiah). HBOMax prefer watch films cinema tv. think big Warner films (dune, Gidzilla), go cinema rather watch home.  You‚Äôre extremely naive thought people least risk death going stay locked see friends year. That‚Äôs realistic. answer always ""when everyone part take situation seriously"" Misinformation.

We know case yet signs still effective. cannot wait full arenas Stanley Cup Playoffs! definitely damage people's perception public health done given endgame went quickly ""two weeks flatten curve"" ""wait till vaccine"", would reasonable endgame? prevent transmission risk serious illness relatively high. risk hospitalization death craters much lower levels vaccination, there's reason enforce mask wearing regardless potential transmission. Spider-Man coming exclusively theatres December! know couple friends event managers things like comic-con E3, I‚Äôve gotta say, they‚Äôve lost year production value past year.

 Compared lets say, programmer largely unaffected pandemic, live event managers need crowds operate hope government lends support. They‚Äôve really rough yeah, easier say ""state mandate"" ""store policy"". especially mom pop shops  difficult force vaccine that‚Äôs new. want get one I‚Äôd like see effects longer. 

With new vaccines coming get distribution faster it‚Äôs harder tell might end able get one trust. amazes EMA approved ages real world data showing effectiveness yet individual countries still follow EMAs advice admit effective elderly especially UK real world data mainly 70s/80s doubts. Can‚Äôt sign local county wait list 275k Unless would mutate dramatically virulent, difference immaterial. COVID fatality rate without hospital care *much* higher quoted IFRs. shut nerd Many masks low quality ill-fitted course effective. ones really help properly used. 

My kids go small school classes less 15 students, wear masks indoor/outdoor, open doors/windows possible. Zero cases one year. 

This way forward continue vaccinate. live Texas tired anti-maskers motivated bunch moronic leaders hiding ranch vacation properties. children organ damage.

Hit us percentages, people say covid affect children mean literally, mean insignificant percentage. provide sourced data supports opposite else take fear mongering bullshit somewhere else completely open months cases still declining.

FL reopened October.

Cases rose, all-time high, [first week started decline. Logistics product supply chains always America‚Äôs greatest strengths. It‚Äôs really WW2, it‚Äôs we‚Äôre going end pandemic country well.  Everyone different things value üòä Yeah...because makes fucking sense I‚Äôve seen plenty people say flat refuse J&amp;J vaccine that‚Äôs vaccination center offer. say want best vaccine available. saw back Pfizer Moderna said they‚Äôd ramp production heavily J&amp;J said supply shortages. probably couple weeks premature, big deal. yes, gov laid specific data based reasons re-impose restrictions needed. Pssst - here‚Äôs study. total 21 studies met inclusion criteria. Meta-analyses suggest mask use provided significant protective effect (OR = 0.35 95% CI = 0.24‚Äì0.51). Use masks healthcare workers (HCWs) non-healthcare workers (Non-HCWs) reduce risk respiratory virus infection 80%

What‚Äôs really weird access info sit using big words talking I‚Äôm uneducated one. Yet info literally hundreds articles studies could find seconds. 

I can‚Äôt comprehend must like live narrow difficult perspective. challenge wish could help way. Best luck. 1929 hit. clear person died COVID-19. article suggesting person died reaction vaccine. course people die time, could case coincidence. autopsy provide information cause death. Even leaving aside important things article mentions cost, stability, etc. sticking strictly focus, things ""number"" cover. noted word 'number' exactly measured, certainly shorthand. Let's also leave aside subject cellular opposed humeral immunity, VERY, important consideration one difficult measure.

So, sticking strictly antibodies measured serial neutralizing titers:

1) Persistence immunity measured antibody level. Whatever level measured soon initial booster vaccination decline variable rate time high (by 'number') low, almost imperceptible actual imperceptible measured laboratory tests ('number' antibodies).

Once plateau open question immune memory whether actually meeting real virus future elicit response fast enough vigorous enough protect vaccinated individual. aspect vaccine efficacy * not* direct one one correspondence initial 'number' measured shortly vaccination. high 'number' may may lead better memory response low 'number'. 

Considerations lies behind recent studies Britain vaccinated people challenged exposure virus. Dicey research terms ethics sure, absolutely necessary 'number' conveniently measure automatic measure *real* protection. 

2) Spectrum protection. Think virus dart board numerous places darts (the antibodies) hit, with, course, various scores depending upon significance area. given vaccine supply darts preprogrammed hit various points board. 

But viruses nasty habit mutating. theoretical consideration. played now, faster personally expected do. South African variant one news, least one vaccine, AstraZeneca one, far less effective strain original virus. early say effect others. 

Back dart board metaphor. new strains like parts board covered metal darts bounce off. situation matters greatly vaccine covers multitude targets virus, preferably important targets (high scores board). 

A higher 'number' darts (more antibodies) may useless least less useful darts hit protected areas board. number darts immaterial majority simply bounce off. 

Spectrum coverage much difficult measure crude titer neutralizing antibodies. *could* done theoretically, practically discovered vaccine program miscarries. 

So, 'number' important complications, already news yet discovered future. arbitrary date picked. Appreciate man.

Just frustrating see people around walk around like thing. 

At least light end tunnel, get 2 shots, months go back small sense normalcy. They'll probably invest GoPros staff, biggest jerks roasted trailers. can't say sure reduce risk serious symptoms lung damage would be.

I got 2nd I'm 30 good shape state said eligible (NJ pretty loose eligbile) took it. overly concerned COVID either. think loss taste smell would suck since like cook. also atheltic losing aerobic ability would suck Triathalon endeavours. J&amp;J going increase number? It‚Äôll expedite completed vaccinations second doses, doesn‚Äôt fix bottleneck states administering fast enough  think lot reporting exaggerating much power influence governors constituents day day behaviors. Individual people businesses make choices, like along. There's never real punitive enforcement mask mandates anywhere America. Masks meant help prevent transmission, even aren‚Äôt always best regard. Dear God, suggesting similar hiv hides body decides pop back again. What's growing elder population part right composed baby boomers 10 years gen X start enter old age well That's bad understanding all.

The vaccine seems good job reducing symptoms, lung issues would definitely symptom. even greater chance wear seatbelt. Age much easier verify frontline status prexisting conditions. It‚Äôs quicker easier distribute based age think peak efficiency takes like 2-3 weeks. still pretty vulnerable especially 4 days. without autopsy nothing suggest vaccine even played part dearh  restrictions enough, schools open, gyms open, nobody getting fined wearing mask. Monday first time whole pandemic people without masks allowed inside store. Jesus Christ, title gore woman reportedly accused vomiting crises among side effects vaccine.

Can anyone offer better translation? imagine means person reported vomiting vaccine. AD theater supported last \~12 years, not/will step foot movie theater I'm fully vaccinated. right many people feel me, Drafthouse [just announced Chapter 11 [are closing flagship Alamo Ritz I‚Äôm saying timeline unreasonable. I‚Äôm saying referring ‚Äújust 2-3 months‚Äù incredibly grating. state police raided home psychotic stalker harassing former colleagues illegally hacked govt database. Thanks im sure it'll fine Oh snap! Congrats both! definitely feel excitement lol wedding planning depressing I‚Äôm happy feel little optimistic there‚Äôs part issue. 

Only states started early. lot states started vaccinating teachers. Also, need remember got vaccine doesn‚Äôt mean immediately safe. states using pfizer/moderna. That‚Äôs two dose regiment says safety immunity fully kicks 3-4 weeks second dose. start shots Jan 1, second round comes end Jan beginning Feb. 3-4 weeks puts March. Still 2-3 months left year lots people unvaccinated (ie families students), still safe everyone point it‚Äôs stupid think teachers early adopter states got vaccine Jan 1st.

Teachers unions definitely protecting teachers also care students teachers work with. Increasing safety measures might take longer, end safety better everyone.

Again though, school year nearly done lots places. schools still closed, might well keep way majority staff vaccinated use time schools empty try plan hybrid models work school sites improve ventilation sites. Agreed. hate media makes headlines feeds anti vaxxers. Without autopsy means nothing anti vaxxers use this. vaccinating millions people naturally die getting vaccine completely unrelated reasons. one insane posts I've seen reddit. state, we're combination enough vaccines incredibly terrible logistics plan distribute residents. whatever reason, chose decentralized low bid online registration sites crash look hard.

Realistically believe we'll supply sort make easy want vaccine easily get one. hope substantial supply online they'll add doctors able administer increase speed rollouts. mass vax sites seem good number Giant/WalGreens/CVS smaller sites getting limited amount done day supply staff limitations.

Get supplies, adjust distribution, open general populace get going. Moderna Pfizer take roughly 6 weeks 0 shots full protection J&amp;J 2 weeks, get readily available May, see fully vaccinated numbers jump tremendously late May / June. sure stats account fact young people likely mild symptoms they're less likely get tested. surprise 85s 1,000 times likely die.  2-3 months unreasonable IMO. Give chance fully deploy vaccines, reopen everything. Anything point ridiculous. matter me, I'm done brick mortar establishments together. Colorado ranked 48th unemployment rate (8.4%) US right now, sure balance worked well. point made ""oh know what's going on, must psychosomatic."" point ""even etiology psychosomatic, symptoms cause real harm distress, suffering deserve compassion medical treatment.""    probably already America. media reporting want false sense security, public wants hear right now. Denying reality truth lead trouble. Everyone needs accept reality covid going disappear anytime soon.  Schools haven‚Äôt open whole time. cdc put 1B lot us. lot states putting ahead 1B. Guess we‚Äôll keep getting exposed Given virus change, mutate mutations direct consequences ""when end"", would expect anything ""depends"" answer. understand frustrating would rather told lies truth? think they‚Äôd lose business? They‚Äôve survived long restrictions.  need better information. completely inaccurate. couple hospitals two states many months ago justification keep hanging onto ""don't overwhelm hospitals!"" line. month second birthday quarantine... kind feel sad literally missed rest teenage years covid, 18 started turning 20 next month. CDC consider teachers groups 1b. 

The reality school shuts outbreak hundreds kids effected. Also hundreds families find childcare go work. lot downstream effects teachers/schools open. messes Texas.  anyone know sign vaccine waiting list (getting call available vaccines) places like cvs heb? check pages ask I‚Äôm elegible group 1A 1B I'd guess either nothing probably worse side effects. I'm sure stage 1 2 trails tried different dosage amounts, could probably see higher level doses initial shot assume probably something similar. make stuff type? 

**Asymptomatic people biggest spreader covid-19.**

[The truth COVID-19 asymptomatic spread: It‚Äôs common, wear mask avoid large envy corner New Zealand backed now. natural immunity means re-joining international community long time.

thanks. looked MSG lot good seats favorite section $100+ fees November. sign up.  brain markets. People vaccinated thinking they're safe covid, going masks prolong pandemic. side supporting here! Yup. 

Opening businesses: get it. People need work go places. 

Ending mask mandate: unnecessary fucking stupid! No, scientific community always said pandemic (and form lockdown) would last least 2 years. government would done jobs locked harder might avoided present situation, that‚Äôs happened. company routinely boots people phone use theaters, think they'll fine.

Either following science numbers aren't. reality probably don‚Äôt need wear mask you‚Äôre vaccinated rollout though aggressive still beginning.

They absolutely will, since peak viral load massively reduced length infection also significantly might huge difference restrictions community needs keep outbreak control depending variant is.

If variant manage reinfect people causing serious negative effects, need go lockdown that. that's U.S. strategy failed - never considered bombing away Covid.

You lived life FINE knew COVID thing. 

I get learning lessons, point going move life. getting sick stores. getting sick work around friends. government mandate lifted doesn‚Äôt mean don‚Äôt wear mask ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è think argue want conclusions, definitely see people annoying low safe numbers cases majority people protected vaccine summer. based people follow definitely forsee lot ""there still cases!!! still need social distance!!!"" rhetoric late summer early fall Ahh thanks looking Lots people, especially south.

I personally witnessed mask wearing go ~25% 100% overnight mask mandate went effect conservative state. 

This well efficacy masks already established. 

I conservative family member tell would wear mask unless mandated.

The mandate gave many people like excuse wear one without ostracized ‚Äúweak,‚Äù bc isn‚Äôt choice longer, it‚Äôs government made it. time worry yet. Anti-vaxxers always there, know labeling concerns crazy helps either. genuine concerns; openly addressed discussed, supported scientific evidence. not, people go looking ADE auto-immune complications without context. media's main goal appeal audiences want hear. audience wants good news covid die soon, media shove false premises covid die months. Oh wow that's lot higher thought. wear something like next concert tour. flu bad 34k deaths year negligible either. wonderful her! I'm kinda wishing thing parents. Dad getting second dose tomorrow, still waiting Mom get first. guess I'll keep trying. No. reason think police listen us word theirs. company trains employees way feel comfortable mistreating patrons broken one rules. 

Btw support rules think warning much ask even given option leaving instead possessions rifled taken. doses, felt like hangover 1.5-2 days, starting 4 hours getting shot.

Also arm soreness duration, much sore 2nd dose. would that? Oh wow, highly regret engaging you. nothing bunch regurgitated drivel. pretty much BS antivaxxers like post. call science, since lose there, act sow bit doubt. That's essentially happened here: copied talking points website frequent expect sway opinion.

And no, apples oranges. arguments masks, usually based liberties rights, IDENTICAL arguments made years ago seat belts. reality, question mandated, rather mandated. People like react told do, even correct thing simply feel shows autonomy (hint: doesn't, sad). Lol. That‚Äôs one bought went around whatever wanted anyway. That‚Äôs one worst death infection rates world. ignore vaccine happening Though would apply basically anything included private corporations cities counties? really. work independently limited means contact working. known risk job working explained multiple times hiring process. So, handled injuries reported soon able. Neither told work injured, chose to. receiving workers comp. returned data, would excused circumstances. disagree praising one fact worked her. every sub criticizing India, US Western world regarding policies, vaccines clinical trials.

You even questioned J &amp; J Pfizer's vaccine clinical trial trying poke holes efficacy readouts got downvoted oblivion.

Then realised Sino subreddit. Funny never questioned lack data clinical trials chinese vaccines, CI place. Bruh China's Sinopharm reported efficacy 72% yet publish results.

China's Sinovac efficacy place too.

Didn't see criticizing that? shills smart.

Curious ü§î Christ. little hope humanity üò≥  Ok don‚Äôt throw fit see someone wearing one model using prove normalizes outputs says ""JB good?"" accounting assess governor performance arrive conclusion?

I've shown mine, complained normalize, provided model does, feelings well.

Do see problem here?  That's problem, though. never really deal begin with. One year since ‚Äútwo weeks flatten curve‚Äù nothing it? God bless sister, got vaccine appointments everyone family (I work healthcare, got mine employer)

Yeah, tactic create accounts people's behalf constantly refresh page updates whenever time work, watching TV night, insomnia, pretty much constantly. Texas: hate Science much; it'll kill you! T-cells absolutely help reducing severity.

We never eradicate virus. bring levels similar coronas already endemic.

The variants concern, also need eventually get back living normally well. tough balance. Nobody cares literally one person would go theater right now. probability pretty high even people efficiancy stay level. could model markov chain example.

And studies continue Yet imagine been? 500,000 people died yet people want act like that‚Äôs big deal. can‚Äôt believe Americans willing go war 2 countries Middle East 3500 dead can‚Äôt bear wear fucking mask save 500,000 Texas: Choose death- freeze covid! Definitely. mean get idea behind I'd rather see vaccine going young healthy persons arm bin. Restricting waitlist makes harder find people take vaccine end day pathetic amount testing one going hospital sick lying cause death cause think like lmao. Invisible Hand immunology. absolutely insane thing say. Deaths/hospitalizations/cases continue drop Texas country. end getting closer. comes across anti-mask comment, dig corporate culture. no...what likely happening list full currently eligible people otherwise unable get appointment. think there's shortage people looking get vaccine yet F handling virus, A+ handling vaccine. I'm Canadian, give us B- handling virus F vaccine. get that, would feel lot comfortable ""all data"" instead ""some data."" :)

Dr.Fauci US politely said ""thanks thanks"" asked extending vaccine gap. We're witnessing real-time science try find definitive answer. personally, would consider fully vaccinated get 2 shots 3 weeks apart: I'm back line get vaccinated right now, second shot (in January? hahaha) followed 3rd shot 3 weeks later, happy camper. uninformed opinion. Harvard, NIH others conclude humidity fact affect spread. course, variable, encourage work informed inputs rather calling trolls. Okay Americans trade you:

Dr. Tam, Dr. Loh, Dr. DeVilla

For 

Dr. Osterholm

We believe trade benefit us. limit top pessimism one doctor doctors add troubled healthcare system. They're making decisions health, they're making decisions health everyone around them, everyone around people.

People like need mandates. made decision care *literally* anyone else, necessary. still spread virus vaccinated nimrod. gives fuck anyone else right? survived pandemic. They‚Äôll fine. really got sucked first one, ngl, lol ripped apart one mom groups saying plan birthday party son end May. born March last year, right everything shut down, it'll delayed outdoors nice weather, safe side. Also, seems like vaccine rollout full force. Many friends family already received doses husband next priority group. We'd also still require masks people need go inside use restroom, etc. 

I want one semi-normal event remember son's first year first time mom. Like others, seen friends family entire year. bad unrealistic? recent news, seem like it. guilt/fear embedded point... Thank you. feeling excluded moment. Better shit Johnson Johnson developed. ""Seems promising"" actually works different things. South Africa mass vaccinated population Astrazenaca realizing actually work variant? Think time effort money lost, distrust would instill populous. allowing vaccine properly vetted, India basically gambled exactly happening. correct, half people vaccinated, still possible act secondary vector disease spreading, even personally vaccinated.

It's magic pill makes worlds problems disappear. something takes months distribute small portion population we'll lucky hit magic 90%+ vaccinated adults years end. don‚Äôt understand won‚Äôt considered broad research U.K. done efficacy AZ Vaccine. UKs death case rate dropping rapidly thanks part AZ vaccine. 

Also evidence Canadian gov changed mind? point article. link study article detailing bunch anecdotal stories - sophisticated rigorous science supporting use masks. think might see localized mask mandates flu, well complementary measures. could another divide culture war. could too, chose included three separate sources, evidence reinfection ... beyond normal levels

So reinfection? you‚Äôre thousands cases hundreds thousands 

So *thousands* documented reinfections, or? 7 em, working towards bakers dozen lol argument healthcare workers, ones receiving first, likely higher risk coronavirus potential side effects vaccine found phase 2 trials. 

It's common see health care workers involved phase 2/3 trials anyways exposure risk. Phase 3 trials usually find rare side effects test prove efficacy.

In fact reason Phase 3 trials fail, failure prove efficacy placebo response find horrible side effect. makes sense phase 3 large scale human trial involving general public, must already known generally safe. getting phase 3, danger smaller issue, efficacy primary goal. Marcus theater, really bad. going police theater much like, younger kids go theaters malls leave one alone, helps lot.  know drama that‚Äôs gonna start Idiots say ‚ÄúGovernor says don‚Äôt to‚Äù. think depends taste films, well viewing preferences. prefer see movies cinema quite like smaller, lower budget films. Quite films released weekly, you‚Äôre huge, blockbuster films see really isn‚Äôt much draw interest. said that, Tenet, Wonder Woman, Monster Hunter, promising young woman, marksman, little things, Judas black messiah movies recently decent sized budget. Warner ones also streamed, would impacted demand. 

And host smaller budgeted films released weekly. similar different thing count number,so tend confused.

Just writing number simple XD    supposed gather people live right now? lol Maybe meant like cough? Expect lot coming days/weeks.

Supply skyrocketing. soon hit demand issues don‚Äôt continue opening up. 

I suspect 60‚Äì70% people 50 vaccinated, they‚Äôll open age groups. Live UK: many older people know AZ. complained arms aching day, said felt ‚Äòhot/cold‚Äô one evening following jab. That‚Äôs it. I‚Äôm sure stronger reactions, many (most?) don‚Äôt. I‚Äôd curious see data this. likely are. 

Expect things change outlook even better say end March. Things accelerating want overpromise ever. sad bloaks Tirol decided would great go SA vacation bring back. worry people....myself included.....may able get vaccinated. history anaphylaxis. looking like Johnson Johnson vaccine might option incidents anaphylaxis approved yet country (Canada). Spread virus though? 18-22 year olds risk virus? Professors see students fully masked can't spread them? gather vaccinated people. it. benefits gain guidance. Masks, distancing, etc still **required** around unvaccinated people, hoping stop spread virus.

A lot people sub seem understand vaccine create magic forcefield around you, still get viral particulates person spread others. vaccine makes virus multiply mass enters body, anti-bodies respond faster. trust vaccine would based consolidated data results, could questioned simple sentence.

It's simple that, real fail AZ Oxford presented uncompleted data. 1. early April trying relate mask fatigue odd choice

2. arrested violating stay home order disobeying lifeguards closed public access. wearing mask open waters.

I'm really surprised twisted relate comment replied to, impressed. yes, that's correct.. able enact one MS.. businesses still mandates (although enforcing issue) Republicans Right, least state level. County Judges (highest executive authority county level) [Clay Jenkins Dallas [Lina Hidalgo Harris fought governor's bullshit every step way. That's uphill battle, though. less vaccinations since essentially missed week vaccinations February due storms. Hopefully catch back soon. could try calling doctor. mom got hospital bc high risk reaction* doctor scheduled her. 

You could also news: negative reaction. That‚Äôs okay, hear news ‚ÄúXX billion yen‚Äù hard time understanding much money is. opinions humidity, socioeconomics, density among things impact output. false.

Can't wait get back old routine getting train city, hopping bike grabbing coffee way work.   always allowed Maybe America?

Not Japan,so send us vaccines (desperate) seems everything ramping seemingly exponentially. Notice timelines ACCELERATING times passes.

Luckily, Brazilian tourists take Insta selfies everywhere (except Asia &amp; Oz). blame shared. First dose vaccine 80% effective. Hmmm, I‚Äôm searching posts don‚Äôt see anything saying want free babysitter. agree this, since goalpost now. definitive timeline back normal around June. Great! 2-3 months. problem me. deal that. Could sworn Israel said 85% happened multiple times already Make sure get good rest drink plenty water. enjoy fuck summer. enjoy fuck college. support promoters artists bring!

Maybe population compliant there, know.

In Texas though, clearly case. Here‚Äôs actual quote, mask mandate. 

‚ÄúEffective next Wednesday, businesses type may open 100% capacity. Additionally, order ends statewide mask mandate Texas. Czechia Slovakia breaking bad records days...   wore schoolhouse rock ""knowledge power"" shirt yesterday get dose one. Definitely felt appropriate occasion. really hope proven wrong think waited 1-2 months. close finish line postpone wedding reception three times now. last one April seems like short. Oct really hope last postponement! mean, facts facts believe those? 

People afraid hope right now. Don‚Äôt that. 

We capable good things. Watch. Italy March 13 wedding started. cancel basically flee Europe. want badly feel confident rescheduling. love goes ""I'm old enough I'm smart enough!"" *Giggles* crying makes happy. truly hoping Texas proves wrong think waited 1 2 months lifting restrictions. ready get back normal much next person wait 7-8 weeks, population chance get vaccine. hit point, say open back look back ...It eluded us then, that's matter. Tomorrow, run faster. Stretch arms further... Iowa. Dakotas. Wyoming. Arizona. Etc, etc. agreement slightly later vaccines produced within EU go America? entitlement lot export ban something else. ""What normally makes German bureaucracy stolid reliable becomes obstacle crisis costs lives"" 

I think excellent example, shows one core differences Germany US.

Pragmaticism vs order.

It little strange solution ""TWO masks now!"" rather recommending N95s higher quality surgical masks; assume want accused ""flip-flopping"" explicitly coming cloth masks.  core problem. People half-assedly, get costs restrictions without benefits.  good point - areas, objections teachers near top vaccine list.

Imagine that!  never made sense me, bank robber concealing face mask would concern violating bank's policy. arguing moron, waste time. Sorry, no. 

Flu nothing, usually healthcare system handles it. Flu inherent risk willing tolerate pandemic. There's lots inherent risks life. want get back seeing people's faces can. someone sick shopping, sure. Otherwise, no. Yeah capacity limits, way also educate importance lock wear mask worth noting [the paper assumptions used error bars figure even allowing assumptions huge. 95% CI 66.6%-97.9%.

Wearing masks around frail people flu season makes sense, masks uncomfortable, fog glasses make much difficult conversations. mention loss seeing people's expressions emotions.

Life meant eliminate risk, reduce acceptable level acceptable cost, universal mask wearing flu season satisfy conditions, opinion. think fair embrace model society scan vaccine passports enter public buildings paranoids. want wear mask Covid longer problem, wear one. pandemic left irrational phobia crowds, avoid basketball games. certainly large part problem, agreed. watching Disaster Capitalists get even richer pandemic help. thought already shut down, no? mean difference moderna/pfizer j&amp;j ? made differently. M/P higher resistance Covid, JJ good it‚Äôs still less effective (which trials second dose impacts immunity).

Right you‚Äôve brought one state, general seems like talking schools states, already said, different vaccine schedules impact safety people coming back.

You‚Äôre also bitching union, said buildings need made ready. wtf? comment also makes sense unions aren‚Äôt charge school buildings. That‚Äôs districts. lot unions saying saying, make buildings safe. districts ones aren‚Äôt moving forward safety plans.

Have things regarding schooling handled terribly? Yes. priority try keep students abs staff safe. People point schools sites less transmission ignore what‚Äôs going schools studied. date hvac? class sizes small? hybrid classes? People also seem ignore places locked down, schools open, schools become places virus spreads from.

So are, March teachers still struggling get vaccinated(though it‚Äôs improving) even vaccinations complete (if everyone gets fully vaxxed March) full immunity lot teachers isn‚Äôt kicking till mid-April, leaves 4-7 weeks school year left.

Vax people improve school site safety. It‚Äôs makes things better long run. common denominator masks

And social distancing, indoor spaces completely mostly closed, increased ventilation, generally minimizing contact people outside one's immediate circle necessary contact.

I'm saying masks work (they do) nearly whole story say masks common denominator. 15$ minimum wage important, especially right now. matter long would take. inflation, 20$ -22$. back original comment, screw parties. That‚Äôs take too. 18+ opportunity get shot, full send. top that, scientifically, there‚Äôs almost way cases don‚Äôt fall god damned cliff stage. think it‚Äôll massive inflection point many great things collide. don‚Äôt think 50%+ people vaccinated it‚Äôll look today. chance. That‚Äôll end. certainly case counts. controversial hardly accurate ""final count"". pretending counts previous pandemics like votes election equally absurd. 

However, correct. 60s pandemic grosses ""only"" 2 million dead. 50s pandemic grosses 5 million. So, COVID still fits within two certainly going worst three. Economy nearly dead. definitely start open. can‚Äôt remain lockdown years variants wait, wait gone!!! next excuse move goalposts question actual efficacy perception. media told Oxford vaccine 8% effective elderly. see, thanks. calling phase 3 solely `effectiveness` trials kinda misleading? They‚Äôre giving state people 35+ BMI. No. love it: covid spreads enough people wearing masks. Flu decimated many people wearing masks. 
The common denominator dominant virus, covid. generally don‚Äôt get impacted virus virus short period time. Covid basically bumped flu aside Ha. Nope. shot #2 couple weeks mas mask. I‚Äôm saying people saying ‚Äúthe governor killing me!‚Äù ludicrous. don‚Äôt feel safe, feel free wear 24/7. It‚Äôs right. Unless you‚Äôre one selfish people already refuse wear one. agree extent Abbott jackass, personally right now? Keep loved ones safe. Flu season fall winter. math, that‚Äôs half year...... taught school. managers impressed came work sick noted must really care work hard.

In case wondering nothing productive day send direct reports home come sick. not? Team USA would dominate competition. Meanwhile still lockdown UK.. yea feel shot either. dont know they're using smaller gage needles nerve damage neck. ... shouldn't. I'm also pretty sure Merkel eyeballs state premiers can't wait retirement. Pre-COVID, wearing mask presentation United States would resulted everyone looking like crazy likely trip boss's office talking to. I'm saying right, way was. It‚Äôs probably likely vaccinated people don‚Äôt transmit virus well. studies underway results expected next month two. Israel Cambridge hospital shown (in preprints) rna vaccines seem significantly reduce transmission. Fuck lmfaoooo Agreed, It‚Äôs wild reactions lift generated. EU governments smeared Oxford vaccine supply dispute AZ (see Macron's ""quasi ineffective"" comment German media claiming 8% effectiveness elderly briefed German government).

Luckily Brits, took notice smears Continent chickens come home roost. Yep, cause mostly negative placebo effect, caused bad PR German government helped create. People feel they're getting ""bad"" vaccine, side effects feel worse. huge amount placebo group trials also reported headaches etc despite given literally nothing. powerful thing.  
 
It's explanation side effects worse countries others exactly vaccine. mine cvs. Click yes priority group, ask ‚Äúteachers/staff‚Äù one drop options. wife tried saturday got monday appointment, know two people day appointment tried get in. You‚Äôd figure recall Newsom movement putting hella pressure. people know took AZ vaccine (four people) sick week flu like symptoms. course much less severe case covid, know people scared taking AZ vaccine due side effects. said, offered vaccine today would exited getting vaccinated.   It‚Äôs even close thing especially context. implications social distancing masks every winter basically means current model school permanent. Get real that. flu season that‚Äôs rising point extreme risk avoidance. It‚Äôs ‚Äúthe masks‚Äù. It‚Äôs lack movement, anybody stuffy nose staying in, covid dominant virus. masks assist, probably they‚Äôre sprinkled fairy dust. it? Manaus reached estimated 76% herd immunity wave 1, 2nd larger wave limited remaining 24%? 

I‚Äôm sorry, doesn‚Äôt add up. Either herd immunity estimates way something else wrong.

Imagine lived wars citizens asked make actual sacrifices. Frankly better opinion. pointed previously profession exempt Hawaii quarantine international quarantines aren‚Äôt prioritized, makes zero sense least perspective. 

So goal isn‚Äôt stop spread(and since I‚Äôm position conclude isn‚Äôt) goal needs purely eliminate death. means going age hospital care home workers POV. 

Yes there‚Äôs gonna people gonna say X, frankly I‚Äôm pretty confident there‚Äôs far elderly people 65 enough pre existing conditions put high enough risk equal fatality risk old person. 

And last argument, shouldn‚Äôt giving vaccines people deserve them, considering race, opinion think would agree ethics questionable. CA first state lockdown last state reopen. Exactly, nobody books multiple flights, near everyone booking spots multiple vaccine waitlists.

We need sites preregistration vaccinate ten thousand people day. It‚Äôs way going burn incoming supply reasonable timeframe. Wtf even talking ahh ""florida, everyone going die"" theory.. ""superbowl super spreader"" ""superbowl parade huge"" theory Prolong certain still spread virus vaccinated definitely still wearing mask. Especially since still catch milder version. K-12, Daycare preschool workers, staff

The CVS website says Teachers staff 'eligible'. go sign up, asks priority group. put yes, fall category? deliberate lies attempt ration limited supply medical PPE? Well EU worked hard scapegoat others (harder actually procuring vaccines), Britain half-British company main targets that. French love Brit-hating, would've totally fallen that. Mississippi big state articles make seem like Germans booking vaccine appointments, turning up, leaving find AstraZeneca shot. reality, population people eligible get AZ shot small can't fill available appointments. bet polled anyone outside UK would prefer Pfizer Moderna shots AZ, mean people would turn AZ shot offered. 

Germany simply needs expand eligible population AZ shot, either raising age limit opening vaccinations under-65 year olds. movie theatre much deadly think covid flu point given current level immunity treatment options? worried flu 2018 (which bad year, anyone remembers)? Would say reaction covid proportional increase risk?

HIPPAA laws protect medical records already. already laws prevent discrimination basis age disability. isn‚Äôt novel issue, variation issue we‚Äôve dealing long time.

I think companies find solution works nearly everyone. Businesses host large, in-person events going choose whatever service cheapest, easiest, provides access largest possible audience. Everyone political viewpoints going inherently view distrust first. business want choose vaccine verification service customers distrust hate, want find service trustworthy. think bipartisan support enact regulations necessary curb anything excessive, don‚Äôt think come that.

I don‚Äôt even think necessarily long-term thing. In-person businesses want stop using services soon possible, along population. easily see large public boycotts service like six months pandemic COVID longer prevalent.

Though new policy remove requirement strongly encourage beyond America: *challenge accepted*

I agree completely Honestly it‚Äôs good news me. someone works healthcare Miami, let tell you, elderly biggest covid spreader. yell old folks wear mask, get mad me. experience anyone 40 wearing mask, get 50, say fuck. talking lot older folks, don‚Äôt want vaccine.

Having vaccines wildly available enough.

Thought bad news. It‚Äôs hard tell mostly people laugh me. :) Actually said new NY variant also shows resistance vaccines. Vaccines widely available yet. still limited many have. went August, June, May. great news It‚Äôs coming!! It‚Äôs going real interesting see whole Texas situation plays out. don‚Äôt see extreme uptick hospitalizations deaths next month so, feel lot pressure states start same. Also, reminder CASES don‚Äôt really matter big picture. matters hospitalizations. goal never avoid COVID altogether, prevent hospital overflow. Sadly messaging changed some. Gotta catch Wearing mask means rant applies you. That's worried about. New strains could fuck progress done countries. believe smarter ban travels to/from Brazil least. guys know everyone going get vaccine, new variants unknown duration efficacy vaccines, virus never fully going away, right? able safely go back normal summer incredibly unlikely.  never wear stupid thing again!

Friendly reminder warmer planet results frequent zoonotic transmission events. 

Maybe could responsible climate change pandemic? top comments that, got go deep thread, (still top level comments, low vote counts) definitely there. Agreed. Gov. requiring districts state submit office plans school reopening. Biden somewhat re: state reopening. there‚Äôs imperfect consumer confidence vaccine. like 1 5 people die ND? Mosh pit come! kidding, I'm old bones would hate me. Long term impacts children‚Äôs health isn‚Äôt known. people don‚Äôt want gamble children‚Äôs long term health prospects. distribution complete cluster fuck, hardly support provided treatments (as opposed vaccines), Trump actively caused tens thousands deaths conspiracy theories... I've claimed superior morality. 26 61... either twice didn't. Governors heard next week latest. thanks absurdities 1 politician others seeking personal fortunes people. Everything bigger TX including upcoming weeks coronavirus cases Yeah. 

I thought gotten point accepted mental health wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúyour feelings‚Äù. Alas, isn‚Äôt convenient argument guess mental health goes back afterthought. 

I hate people assume anxiety/depression brought up, we‚Äôre immediately attacking character, claiming lying. aren‚Äôt - we‚Äôre trying bring possible cause. aren‚Äôt saying symptoms aren‚Äôt - 100% are. it‚Äôs always thought attack, unfortunately. *quite early 1/3rd Americans say they're getting vaccine, it'll take years years goes away US. means various companies promised deliver enough vaccines end may. Actually getting peoples arms likely take bit longer. Though hopefully Biden continuing philosophy promising happen quicker like 40% haha.. take them? I‚Äôm sure least will.

Most us would love get vaccinated. president want make easier happen. Oh shut up. Nobody last March saying ‚Äúlockdown get vaccine‚Äù worn mask asked.

Those experts told us masks help first month thing...  said early December SAME. LETS GET IT. sub positive! Love it. still done none actual work defeat pandemic.

So I'm guessing six vaccines authorized worldwide, three authorized US, well two life-saving drugs approved use FDA way progress defeat COVID. billions dollars spent research, development, trials distribution thrown away guess. *never actual lockdown, literal bare minimum necessary counter pandemic*.

I mean, bare minimum contact tracing border closures. Unfortunately country size United States, tourism United States has, bound get almost outset pandemic. could closed borders, surely would stiff resistance Congress courts action taken *as early required* restrict virus access US via international travel. nothing suggests US capable handling Covid better.

The United States enough doses entire population vaccinated June. *European* countries, even neighbours north, could asking for. may utterly incompetent controlling pandemic - sure hell exit. vaccines also created using cell lines aborted fetuses. understanding Catholic church always urged people still get vaccines unless options available harm disease far outweighs every concern. 

I suppose irresponsible asshole arguing *are* vaccines Covid, that's really going true many people. Even US, pretty much take whichever vaccine we're offered possibly wait many months, long time wait people still infected dying. 

But many poorer countries ultra low temperature freezers rare, J&amp;J vaccine going realistic option people. Discouraging people getting vaccine working vaccine soon possible par discouraging condom use AIDS epidemic. hope turns meme sub share dank Coronavirus memes well virus gone. Thank goodness don‚Äôt live ever plan go first question is, news organization ask Johnson Johnson true? Even refused comment indication even attempted ask. HYPED Texas, Basically anyone 18 certain conditions qualify vaccine. Unfortunately, also means people claim condition don‚Äôt ‚Äúline jump.‚Äù There's end sanctimony there? Yeah honestly I‚Äôm fully vaccinated wife obtained appointments get vaccinated we‚Äôre comfortable going back ‚Äúnormal‚Äù (still masking). Planning starting travel whatnot again, go plane, see vaccinated friends. etc Cap Mask mandates social distance recommendations protecting others wearer rather way around. walk around without mask much putting risk endangering others. comment akin saying allowed drive drunk safe driver drunk. care much risk personally willing accept, care much risk subjecting others too. There's much done protect idiots themselves. I‚Äôm still concerned organ damage. know happens entirely often adults, even minor cases. need see studies organ damage children.

I‚Äôm willing risk son‚Äôs health it. Hopefully J&amp;J vaccine approved young kids soon. Wow great, keep mind virus comes waves we‚Äôve seen decreases like before. Let‚Äôs get complacent reach herd immunity. Stay safe, buddy! can‚Äôt serious right? 2 million vaccines per day 1 year ago? better treatments knowledge 1 year ago? No, constitution often black white doesn‚Äôt always give federal government options needs handle nuanced situations based study suggested city Manaus reached 75% infection.

I‚Äôve seen lot criticism Manaus study. based conclusion data blood donors- already representative population- furthermore solicited blood drive offering free Covid antibody test free Uber ride, selects even unrepresentative population people poorest, hardest hit areas people suspected, probably good reason, already Covid. Even that, number 49%, adjusted 75% account antibody decay using mathematical models, already kind sketchy foundation conclusion given little solid data illness antibody decay even sketchy considering data already likely flawed.

At time model estimated Manaus 66% seropositivity, another study using different methods put number 14%.

I think it‚Äôs much clean assume study simply flawed try justify conclusion positing 50% new infections reinfections, isn‚Äôt happening anywhere else world except one place poorly designed study happened run.

Of course, doesn‚Äôt mean reinfections don‚Äôt exist variant nothing worry about. it‚Äôs probably worrying people saying is. Well shit, money Florida first state. Mississippi: wait, us too! Lol people nerve ""WHAt mEAN REStRiCTIONS eveRyTHiNG OPeN"" want scream throw fucking zoom classes literally can't access labs cancelled opportunities needed advance career. going applebees lmao I've said before:

 **Florida covering numbers awhile now. course know get info Cooperate Right wing media. corporations financial interest opening everything regardless many die $$$$$$.**

**\*** massive purported sorry converse people admit wanting things get others killed Maybe. keep hearing vaccine need. hear new mutations covid 19. I‚Äôve also heard vaccine doesn‚Äôt offer full immunity, partial. 
But I‚Äôve also heard/seen/read vaccine provides longer immunity getting covid 19 naturally. 
There‚Äôs much contradictory information take post like seriously.   Let‚Äôs hope applies variants well dense don‚Äôt see difference year ago now? one time event. flu yearly, virus variants may cycle often, need manufacturing infrastructure retail distribution place able adapt future pandemics system thought. Soo.. saying Iowa need masks since high density people? mask mandate begin with? really seems story UK (and Reddit). Honestly pretty weird read UK paper see defensive ""their"" vaccine. rest Europe noone cares vaccine comes from.  June 24th take account Johnson Johnson assumes rate increase. Good. Countries need take responsibility health citizens instead delegating foreign institution doesn‚Äôt care them. Here's trophy üèÜ Abbot override cities counties wanted tougher precautions did? Beginning plateau? 7 day moving average daily new cases US peaked January 11 dropping like rock ever since. today, they're 27% Comic Con cancelled July fml these, called N501Y ‚Äì variant¬†originating UK¬†also ‚Äì allow virus spread easily. P1 also carries another mutation called E484K, might allow resist antibodies generated earlier forms stage, scientists still researching P1‚Äôs capabilities. An¬†early piece research¬†‚Äì yet reviewed scientists ‚Äì estimates P1 1.4 2.2 times transmissible variant UK dealing last summer. research also suggests among people natural immunity infected earlier coronavirus strain, P1 may able reinfect 25% 61% time.

Sooo....which it? 25 - 61 hell range one. Second, still researching, told still unsure? One paragraph written without doubt true, contradict next sentence.

Not mention keep hearing vaccine manufacturers vaccine handle variants. Yet media stories keep adding mutations evade antibodies (which vaccines supposed teaching body do). 

Looks like another click bait headline. certainly reduce cases brought country politicians May almost make headline meaningless Absolutely saying that. never worn mask flu season intend going forward.

So ensure local politicians mandate masks upcoming flu season? Time ticking need make sure mandate place flu deaths? Turkey always bucket list. It‚Äôs actually open US tourists negative COVID-19 test, I‚Äôve waiting vaccine become widespread.

If friends still want house maskless summer, thats fine. I'll sad that's call. Similarly, friend wants go clubbing June, that's fine too, sure I'd join point judgement. Florida convince them, would Texas? raised Catholic know saying, staunch conservative Catholics well. don‚Äôt care people would definitely care mandates past time absolutely necessary Yes, SA variant partially evades vaccines Damnit Randy! stop. sub get invaded bots something. sub November-December, reacts way differently comments similar this. swear comments coming 3-5 month old accounts. indication severity reinfection? Although concern transmission apparent, symptoms milder initial infection, would noteworthy? expect enough vaccines everyone end May, therefore well 75% vaccinated late summer. We'll completely back normal point Often significant percentage cases lots things is.

I think people attach much stigma little power ability psychology affect body.

The reason random group double-blind controls US drug trials, etc, we've established quite well psychology impact outcomes separately treatment ways statistically significant. may not.

Also todays weather: may cold outside best case cases deaths otherwise would have. Worst case cause mutation evades vaccine develop, spreads we're another 9 months. Republicans trying kill Texans completely point. Well, he's already really, really good half equation. wanting kill others? two months enough vaccine everyone. good question. number differences Covid seasonal flu warrant different response.

1. time seasonal flu hits full force seasonal flu vaccination rates tend much higher (~50-60%) current Covid 19 vaccination rate (~10%). higher able get vaccination rate returning regular life, greater protection vaccine grant us individuals. 

2. Even receive flu vaccine particular year, ever vaccine past flu past, likely residual immunity reduce severity flu disease experience. Covid 19 novel virus US generally little relevant immune memory pull unlike flu.

3. Allowing Covid spread vaccinated people, even symptoms mild, contributes virus's ability mutate. strong understanding influenza mutates look order identify dangerous flu mutant. true Covid 19, possible mutant escapes vaccine could develop reckless virus still prevalent population.

4. Covid 19 simply much infectious seasonal flu. Due masks social distancing almost flu season winter, yet millions still infected Covid. Edit. Stop giving awards lol

Kids greater risk Covid seasonal flu. people didn‚Äôt get seasonal flu vaccines (and didn‚Äôt work well even did). didn‚Äôt worry seasonal flu children‚Äôs health, shouldn‚Äôt worry Covid. I‚Äôll give us well earned credit now-improved better vaccine effort, holy shit, American let tell *dark* year now.

I get Pfizer vaccine tomorrow feels like I‚Äôm dreaming. It‚Äôs finally end. Florida California right next state rankings deaths per capita. One state restrictions, least nation. wound exact place. planet elderly getting vaccine first...because elderly dying...

Haven‚Äôt seen whole lot news Mississippi vaccinating millennials...  take Detroit Lions fan 7 day moving average 2M per day! (2,064,875 exact) thought saying cases plateauing. Yes, decline showing signs plateauing, that's last week I'm betting prove blip might even due reporting backlog bad weather. Yes will, barring terrorist attack natural disaster, major issue. Production still ramping we're even peak. Meanwhile people trying use covid scare tactics mexicans Since talking God forsaken Texas, let's use football analogy then: one hand players last ones locker room, first leave. hand, players first ones show up, last ones leave. hard figure group tends success. 15, flu actually twice happened Florida already? Good you, choice! one going tell wearing one. originated single dose actually administered. seemed pretty ambitious time.  Public health messaging helped misconception. solid scientific data there, Fauci Biden , media every expert MUST shout mountaintops! beach better ready Baywatch run I'm gonna hitting hard. scientist knows mechanism people feeling better vaccine virus gave CFS/MS like symptoms. 

Scientists divided CFS MS start, it‚Äôs uncommon happen part post viral syndrome. would guess they‚Äôd need confirm caused friend‚Äôs CFS study there‚Äôs vaccine possibly viral cause determined friend. literally can‚Äôt determine virus caused far out, there‚Äôs guarantee there‚Äôs vaccine thing caused it, friend could suffering CFS due host issues affecting her. 

That‚Äôs hard study it‚Äôs easily identified COVID. records virus spreading fast. ‚ÄúIf hospitals aren‚Äôt overwhelmed, people choose drive drunk choice‚Äù

People wearing masks overwhelms hospitals first place dipshit mum (77) want AZ vaccine ""MNRC"" vaccine affect fertility. 

Just saying, lot damage done, pretty much everybody. First British PM gambling without much evidence, delivery farce, nonsense German paper, questionable effectiveness Southern hemisphere variants. Macron's wind-up act even necessary. 

The Franco-german U-turn may make things worse. believe vaccine, probably make even less convinced. feel business capacity limits. 

I can‚Äôt life understand lifting mask mandates. It‚Äôs super low effort put mask benefits significantly outweigh negatives. India hit developed countries seeking block joint initiative South Africa patent waiver Covid-19 vaccines drugs accused trying protect commercial interests companies. Though countries already accounted great see company actually track deliver contract. big mess EUs vaccine program atm imagine would without Pfizer/Biontech Sign up, line up, shoot up. provide source? I've heard couple people employers trying find legally ask yes/no employee vaccinated not. judgement, tell people working building ""40% co-workers vaccinated"" whatever is. way people whose work done home decide okay risk level come back person adjust caution levels feel appropriate. far looking like may close HIPAA violation happen, also makes think people expected choosing vaccinate. invited wedding July, totally gonna go stupid go dumb Everything's bigger Texas isn‚Äôt ranting right-wing talk show host say - Covid less dangerous kids seasonal flu. Covid much dangerous older adults flu, less dangerous kids. concern related kids giving adults (which also don‚Äôt well), concern kids‚Äô health isn‚Äôt literally 0, less seasonal flu understand US friendly UK, Philippines (regardless president) Israel Canada right? 

Nope, I'll end politics allowed sub. Yeah that‚Äôs dude like lot beer friends, person game nights.

Just man, lol  work summer job camp two months every year, didn‚Äôt happen last year first time 80+ years. It‚Äôs going year planned... still really hoping (the staff) get vaccinated before, there‚Äôs question campers less eligible vaccination obviously lower priority adults compromise 90% staff. hope right elaborate assumptions? must missing something. 

End may enough doses everyone 16+. Well - probably sometime mid-to-late-April, we'll enough doses everyone 16+ actually wants one. Assume April 30. would final doses. get bottlenecked administration vaccine Mid-May everyone willing fully vaccinated (since take \~2 weeks shipping administration) end May (if assume duration delivery completion did). I‚Äôve working COVID testing vaccines last 6 months. Never thought I‚Äôd work industry. people absolutely amazing work with. recent distribution vaccines fun I‚Äôve ever work short professional career. vibes work people coming receive vaccines indescribable, it‚Äôs positive finally actually seeing progress made feeling unlike other. PEOPLE FUCKING CLOSE! DONT GIVE NOW. PAST MONTH REWARDING THING EVER DONE. Yes are. know least one study TN younger kids. truth, liking change that.  don‚Äôt think former best friend leave house ever again. Sad. This.

Anti-maskers CHOSE anti-maskers. care law says. What's important keeping people misinformed. need start loosening restrictions get vaccinated ASAP else lot vaccines sitting freezers... agree everyone ""journey"" back normalcy. important enough vaccine restrictions allowed people make choices based level risk acceptance.

It's going beautiful summer! mean shutdowns made people loose livelyhoods, forced abusive situations, forced miss cancer screenings aren‚Äôt irreversible damage? 

What mask mandate whole thread talking about? even arguing instead strawman created. wish old life. Quarantine basically lived before. do? I'd expect Texas likely thing. know mask mandate (Alabama) expires Friday county Birmingham likely Huntsville maybe Montgomery Mobile might mask mandates. Texas entered chat This!  case stands Latin ""mille"", thousand. So, saying ""thousand thousand"" million.

I swear they're allergic freaking wearing masks thinking others. 

I wear one work 8-12 hours day, problems talking, working, moving living. Everything probably going effectively open end month, think people going wait government. Regarding Alabama, suspect that's true. current order adopted back January expired March 5th 5PM would surprised let lapse.

Some friends practice COVID wards tell hospitalization COVID especially serious cases way down.  reaction nowhere near level COVID gotten. completely taken air room news, almost everything see somehow tinted COVID colored glasses. 

This generation defining event. entire world ground halt. There‚Äôs videos biggest cities humanity ever seen absolutely deserted. I‚Äôd argue WWII last even global impact. remains seen COVID comes define world way WWII it. US emerged superpower WWII, China emerge true super power said done? Let‚Äôs hope not‚Ä¶. Tradesman here. wear masks everytime I'm indoors, many times outdoors working proximity others. happily part slow spread, especially person visits multiple facilities regularly. said, cannot wait wear mask busting ass. really care shopping anything else, moments sweating much eyes hurt salt fucking mask makes worse. experience anecdotal, know quite people caught Covid. caught co-worker, family member, hanging friends.

Pro tip best response I've seen pandemic guests along lines ""We wish put marriage longer, understand guests uncomfortable fully respect decision go. please tell us timely fashion. presence missed, look forward catching comfortable time us.""

Seriously, best response I've gotten.

Come USA, land get first shot, staying 3+ weeks, get second shot! Travel USA! Maybe maybe me, Catholics does.  I‚Äôm guessing there‚Äôs miscommunication revised reach open season vaccine, yeah obviously waiting zero Covid untenable health care system nowhere near collapsing, that. changed politics instead investing health care system way act restrictions. mean plenty unused ventilators (hundreds) use them, trained staff one year, money invested hiring staff..We work within limits normal capacity there's ""more few"" corona patients ICU solution closing schools restaurants.

I understand chosen politics. Right appears we‚Äôre getting top relax guard. experienced none past 12 months. It‚Äôs people cannot learn. always lies, propaganda, new things.

The difference communication expanded level never possible. self-serving lies, half-truths propaganda come wider variety sources.

It unrealistic expect media behave well; media run humans, corporations, greedy fallible humanity itself. Certainly would nice, unless magic solution make actors good actors, increase restrictions media (unlikely, particularly USA built notion freedom speech, upsides downsides), seems like wishful thinking me.

Consequently, necessary society individuals within society develop discernment, become sophisticated dealing media. 

In short, education, healthy dose scepticism. consumers innate right truth handed us plate. Finding truth takes little effort, always has. everyone Twitter replying news ""enough supply, everyone vaccinated then."" I'm confused. tiime ""Beat Gov.

Also, when‚Äôs wedding? equally hard hit country like Belgium already registering fewer 20 deaths per day, that's schools hair dressers open, AZ given 65s. 

There different ways skin cat. That‚Äôs less 3 months away. Get champagne ice! LET‚ÄôS FUCKING GO! There's countless viruses allowed spread 0 steps taken stop (or even monitor) could potentially mutate enough cause problems. live Alaska. could export much fucking water to. There‚Äôs live rivers people isn't. real world studies hundreds thousands people showing effectiveness. debate effective elderly. FAQ unrealistic. Even best COVID vaccines 100% effective everybody get one. Getting 0 COVID cases isn‚Äôt realistic world anymore. That‚Äôs like saying need get 0 flu cases. Nobody world expects that, yet it‚Äôs basically logic.

We‚Äôre going live this. looks like we‚Äôre going live incredibly same/rare case numbers, COVID going exist long long time.   also stop wearing seatbelts, condoms, motorcycle helmets. stop masks? go, please get hammered ruin ex's wedding please would say ask doctor. might extremely uncomfortable post wisdom teeth surgery guess depends severtity removal you‚Äôre getting knocked many people die obesity smoking see people calling lockdown McDonald's.

Florida opened everything alarmists saying ""WE'RE GONNA DIE"" comparable statistics California. Vaccines rolling quickly, gonna soon. mother received first shot two-shot vaccine (Moderna, think). Today, offered one-shot J&amp;J vaccine. Would two second Moderna sufficient? *happy human noises* Idk, life kinda sucks tbh. rest life spent corporate slave, come home 2 3 hours actually exausted anything, barely weekends errands chores.

Sorry, I've going it. gonna great yearlong road recovery return pre-corona lifestyles. Looking forward getting inoculated ditching mask several months that. estimates moved end May old ‚ÄúOpen winda get sum ‚Äòrona outchea!‚Äù plan.

I dig it. Currently Japan 2.4% positivity rate. US around Mine, too, I'll doubling on. Sore arm day half bit headache day after. Haven‚Äôt gotten second yet. I'm sure aware, Japanese human beings behave like human beings. Lol vibe sub markedly different. Granted, seen optimistic couples recently past months. still plenty people written 2021 impossible normal weddings.

Edit: I'm super optimistic signed contract December 2021 wedding days ago. ya, said already. prolly 90 percent. thats less 100%.  may start campaign encourage people possibly offer incentives. moment that's issue peak around 50% vaccinated think that's low fully go back normal (plus people vaccinated increase mutations), new challenge.  pass it? guess somewhere between, depending logistics motivated find appointment. Thank you!!! LFG!!! Happy hunting!!! well it‚Äôs Texas, sure make wrong decision still open Texas wearing masks tho 1. normal vaccine development timelines, much timeline actually spent securing funding clearing administrative barriers. Due high-urgency nature pandemic, minimized.
2. scientific development vaccine took time. said before, much time taken normal timelines involves registering trials like, made quicker urgency matter.
3. vaccines went exact trial process others do. already tested upwards 60,000 people even heard efficacy rate.
4. trials normally take much longer wait subjects exposed disease data come in. particularly hard catch Covid days. result, much data came significantly quicker.
5. thing long-term side effects vaccines.

I'd happy answer questions. Summer rate (I mean July 21st, Memorial Day weekend) Nationally looks way, every state's graph different. lot states waves come go docent times. seasonality different parts Brazil different, without national leadership states outcomes divergent. someone please life FUCK answer question VARIANTS?! Got first dose NC today, foresee South opening way earlier should. Get n95. /r/masks4all Oh shaming judgement. That's pretty much social media best. people think everyone wear masks long ""all clear"" issued they'll vocal it. difference time everyone access vaccine critical mass nation vaccinated loud opinion vocal minority point. moved Florida years ago I‚Äôd make trip NYC.

FTFY Every place place, places survive. We're going first round definitely interest going... almost anywhere. 2 weddings August December. Catch making guests 3 pretty much limited number mutations evade immunity, spread well cause severe disease. floated lot times, since fatal cases closely tied age pretty difficult justify. According CDC data, 65-74yr old 73x likely die become infected 18-19yr old, demonstrate prioritizing younger populations end reducing infections enough counteract clearly likely. Older cohorts even risk death. ""begins""

As half country cared past two months.  Long Covid organ damage reality kids. like rest population, every kid's body lasting effects, concern parents. me. mean want isolate vaccinated, stay away adults know love vaccinated. hanging kids without masks happen kids vaccinated want long term damage. We've come far trials kids 6-11 underway, see end. Like China Vietnam. only!  patience over. pandemic not. Nahhhh, excuse it‚Äôs ex. Skip shit lol. postponed mine June 26th year. decided two months ago push summer 2022 finished paying rescheduling fees everything. feel like doofus. :( mean Federal Gov‚Äôt bypassing State governments self imposed extra restrictions? it‚Äôs great. Oh yes I'd heard skin skin fee.

Where live part described could significant cost ambulance journey.

An urgent ambulance could easily run $900 more, insurance take (which had) that's around $62 pper year.

Strangely though, remote part country, I'd flown city plane helicopter cost. (Look Royal Flying Doctor Service curious....) May 8th, too! made optimistic ""spectacular"" mean ""we masked outdoor gatherings immediate family"", yes. can't return normal one risk even getting sniffles. selfish. Seriously though. Nobody wants new normal. want old normal. get final vaccine, I‚Äôll wait another 2 weeks immunity kick in. that, I‚Äôm going party. Like sniffing cocaine random hooker‚Äôs buttholes Vegas partying. I‚Äôve done part last year isolating playing safe. I‚Äôm it. people don‚Äôt want get vaccinated it‚Äôs widely available end dying, that‚Äôs problem. J&amp;J similar vaccine technology Merck‚Äôs failed attempts vaccine therefore likely easier adapt too. keeping restrictions place people want vaccine get one (~2 months) winding restrictions county county basis recommendation federal, state, local department health officials based hitting rate infection, hospitalization, death, full vaccination targets. 

not single expert planet recommending keeping things restricted covid eradicated. virtually telling us woods yet. 

it really amazes many people can't see absolutely poorly wind go. country fucked pandemic almost every way possibly could equivalent population Kansas City terms 170 9/11's worth people died (so far) one year (the anniversary first death yesterday). could possibly give anyone confidence screw part well? find want one, started yet. Pfizer made us. saying. Modern J&amp;J were. mention keep hearing vaccine manufacturers vaccine handle variants. started developing third, booster shots suggests current vaccines can't ""handle variants"". I‚Äôm May ELATED. security paradox.  want see family üòì data (""limited information""). say ""more enough data""?? got signed get vaccine Thursday, morning I'm also getting wisdom teeth removed. can't call dental office cause closed, anyone know dangers involved this? Idk wisdom teeth extraction impact vaccine. ‚Äúcould‚Äù ‚Äúmaybe‚Äù. would like see research sounds little ridiculous. almost there. summer going fully open whether liked not. would prioritize one What‚Äôs point? nearing endgame vaccines. Last march barely knew shit covid spread. We‚Äôve 10 months, I‚Äôm sure wait take mask. get vaccinated right like did. Ever take moment think might supporting problem instead solution? flu dangerous kids teens Covid.   Hundreds millions people Africa, Asia South America getting vaccinated time soon. virus going mutate enough evade vaccines going happen regardless. ""people"" mean every human planet located Australia New Zealand, yeah, that's true. failed relying people completely abstain social contact entire year always losing gambit. Education, information, harm reduction always right answer - refused acknowledge now. evidence mounting harsh business closures lockdowns put big dent pandemic numbers hoped, US leaders starting recognize that. miss reading books coffee shops Yeah I'm 77 years old average age death covid 19 long old people sick protected, happening now, I'm ready get world again. free stay home basement forever screech though. expat thing, need work permit/work visa get shot? every heb. 10 minutes saw least 5 maskless assholes last week. mean? ever try go bar restaurant quarantine? either closed limited capacity. Marine again? Many pharmacies distributing via federal government seems guidelines? mean, vaccine stop people dying new strain, go back normal. would one reason. that's try kick thing's ass quickly possible, let linger around summer, might get hit resistant variants. Exactly not. hope employers recognize flexible What's big deal wearing mask public means start going lives normally? small ask protect still waiting get vaccinated things open up/ can't vaccinated due disability risk collective immunity built up. Yeah. Also, think 2022 also mean we're giving people chance ease back society. bet lot people going want go directly vaccine unmasked wedding dancefloor month (though bet lot will!)  Awesome Possum. lets gooooooo  Sub say fearporn.  Yeah well complicit killing 100ks people guess silver lining? deprive medical professional person higher risk one? thanks. That's vaccines work Texas- hold beer mindset help us get pandemic sooner

But, think middle ground: vaccinate Americans American produced vaccines first, continue pump vaccines worldwide live Texas, think trying please everyone forget power grid crisis. Miss Biden? likely due India's unique situation they're good vaccine supply good logistics bureaucracy required distribution.

Throttling vaccine exports actually solve problem. continue export vaccines cannot use time, good countries receiving good world whole *and* actions like helpful India global player. Well sir, UK part EU, due respect talking nonsense. vaccine seem cause different immunity reaction older people. We‚Äôre year still people comparing covid cold? Come now. odd me. Masks incur basically harm society we‚Äôll vaccinated within 3 months. continue using masks everyone chance get vaccinated? Definitely check dr. give anything like Tylenol etc may impact effectiveness vaccine summer coming fast. [keep holding precautions September 5th &amp; could ready!!!  myth. scientifically, peer reviewed studied. hope things based anecdotal evidence moon might made cheese make back, peer reviewed study says otherwise. Correctly. Like California NY disastrous consequences there. Masks really helped BEYOND happy genuine question, see significant uptick 24/7 vaccination sites match incoming supplies? EZ: facts evidence. point vaccinated well % people getting hospitalized people ones risk...

You question asking planet I‚Äôm living on...

I explain targeting elderly millennials that‚Äôs they‚Äôve vaccinated risk...

I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre problems grasping simple concept want slam Mississippi keep society closed 99.4% survival rate...

But...wow...just wow... Oh, god, yes. wedding May 30 would see people sub cancelling October 2021 weddings would make sad. I‚Äôd come read everything going open April feel much better! Obviously one knows, definitely needed (and still need!) optimism.   ever really closed? Also, trying kill everybody? I'm sure able find enough yourself. Concretely, concern would variant evades vaccines.

The feds seriously ramping genomic surveillance virus, vaccine manufacturers really top modifying shots accommodate changes.

All combined slowing virus evolution mass ***global*** vaccination means we're going progressively make harder harder new variant sneak us ""out nowhere"". It‚Äôs time reopen 7% state vaccinated? make last longer Fantastic!! Yep, plus lot family practice doctors don‚Äôt ultra cold storage give J&amp;J one. love people say ""it's mask"" restrictions school, gatherings, businesses exist. never mask, Texas playing period. No, keeping everyone wants vaccine one. May remember dad kept telling worry stop paranoid.. joined sub january 2020 So.... soon mean. Sitting waiting room first vaccine right now! realized sarcastic. county limits county residents; since Gila county basically filled small towns, it‚Äôs huge deal someone travels one town another. countries definitely pay though, obviously. Canada afford pay full price vaccines. reason USA countries signed contracts first Except Amazon, Walmart, Kroger companies made record profits... States start loosening restrictions get vaccines become available. like we're putting fire, right we've gotten embers, Abbott pours gasoline it. ~~Un. Be. Liveable.~~ Completely believable.

FTFY

Source: lifelong Texan. Keep it. need next pandemic. Ebola-22. what? puts pressure places designed pressure, warp mask interfere seal. Except, No, thats data showing. Positive-detections, Hospitalizations Deaths trending downward bit there,.. leveled longer reducing. (mutations irresponsible behavior aren‚Äôt going magically make go down). 

We‚Äôre still seeing average around 1,200 deaths per day. 

People want make mistaken argument ‚Äúthis worse Flu‚Äù.

Even worst Flu year (estimating 62,000 deaths),.. thats 169 deaths per day. 

So current death rates, Corona 7x worse Flu. Literally laws criminalizing it. people something it‚Äôs mandated law. That‚Äôs humanity. similar laws mandating masks, ignorant fools right thing they‚Äôre forced to. hope right 88% population getting it. Polling painted less rosy picture. [This suggests 50% adults want vaccine ASAP, another 30% sitting fence. 

In case, supply definitely there. real question whether ""shots arms"" keep supply. Currently, there's awful lot unused capacity. I'm cautiously optimistic US able scale doses administered average 3-4m/day spring.  sure lockdowns effective? understanding Florida lockdowns well Massachusetts lockdown-centric. Plus Florida high population old people would expect deaths much worse there.

Not certain data though.    ...because that's exactly it. wanted economic boost fully open restaurants bars, used lack evidence due literally none open evidence safe fully reopen, least that's telling people. man criminally negligent, along scumbag R-party cronies. think opening shots everyone ASAP. restrictions, slow administration vaccines. governor asked multiple times dodged question. never given meaningful answer take fully reopen. exactly federal leadership needs start publicly pushing state leadership come realistic plans timelines share them. Seems line texas governor previously did. stay home long want. understood reference. Canadian, agree 100% you. Canadians want many things ways comes US. poppers Lol. must Daily Express something. There's point live life. 

Once vaccinated keep wearing mask. Oh look. Texas making fantastic decisions. Looks like someone took page trump's book doubling down. definitely distract everyone Abbott's fuck up.


Glad left shithole state. eat want die yourself. That‚Äôs call.

I extreme risk, stay home, family member bring virus home selfish prick walked right near precautions taken. That‚Äôs difference. People get virus everything can. It‚Äôs really hard. It‚Äôs year Yes pace glacial Ohio. hope picks soon. Exactly. bar reopening ‚Äúabsolutely big opportunities virus mutate‚Äù may well end restrictions today, cause aren‚Äôt ever hitting goal.

Wait days watch become truth majority redditors. weeks ago, CDC says n95 masks short supply reserved medical professionals. Article said something else. Well I‚Äôll damned clear, Canada asking handouts. We're asking America produce vaccines they've already ordered pay full agreed price for.

I actually agree rest comment, re: needs most, needs said. ""survival fittest"" studies peg 1/20. I'd call rare infectious days least symptoms chances coming contact high anywhere else, considering ventilation short duration contacts it‚Äôs particularly worrisome. yes, includes cost. didn't, would top 5 10.

1. Cost important factor, especially costs paid individual leave bankrupt without care can't afford

2. Source claim?  Yes early. know well work variants arrive summer, long one shot offers protection for. leadership federal level needs start publicly forcing governors come reasonable plans timelines states. late July same, pushed back 2022. least international guests likely come now, bright side!

 baby January. premie flu/ rsv season hardly visitors started. think fine 100% agree you. People like talk years come became new mom pandemic. extra criticized double rhink everything. I've friends say irresponsible wanting take son outdoor market fully eveyone (minus people) masked. never liked mom groups, excuse women get together silently judge one another opinion. pandemic made worse moms trying outdo ""who stay safer"".  numbers spark joy. yep live california rural area sheriff police came last year saying wont enforce orders county remained mostly open since around may last year.  Thank literally nothing anyone yourself.  in.... Vaccine working...  exact thing happened me. read 30 awe-struck good is. think book read made feel way 100 years solitude.  think that's easily safe bet summer, considering 90% deaths 60+ years old. bet we'll get 600/day end March problem.  Last Wednesday around 74k cases. Looks like today mid 50k range. summer might biggest party ever.  bad though? They're getting event scenario either, business harmed. I'm college everyone prefers I'm at. I've never focused classroom vs literally wherever else want that‚Äôs reasonable. Going balls immediately seems little foolish, though. wait like month. 

I doubt amounts much anything noise. People don‚Äôt give fuck haven‚Äôt really much prevention anyway, rest keep been.   state thinks survive without America

as long get cold... Texas already 100% open months....??? tend agree. would difficult enforce, don‚Äôt want discouraging people.  telling ""Get flu vaccine protect others!"" nonsense?

Phew, clear conscience never getting flu shot. guys really see everything ""my side good, side bad""? fucking exhausting. though. risk infected higher risk severe outcome definitely lower.

Older people worse covid, period, full stop. do. want prevent sickness death fastest, efficient manner, vaccinate oldest youngest. fact anyone arguing ridiculous. believe ever claimed going spike. Lmao yeah yall love state sovereignty bullshit power water. sudden we're together. Fuck off. In-person bigger deal, imho.

It'll easy drop mask mandates fall they've relaxed everywhere else then, least enforce among older grades (since teens transmission vector young kids)  That‚Äôs fringe group decades nobody takes seriously. California group like too.  20 minute montage called Ticket Tazers. people get uppity, start blasting. Texas called Alamo. Make stand. Research shown that, occupations, cooks seen biggest increase mortality pandemic.

How integrate food low-risk? many loud, cramped working conditions, much worse ventilation kitchens. They‚Äôre never going say go club unmasked. People CDC recommend masks effective seven days?  ...and republished day widely read. vaccine miracle us right now. You‚Äôd never know tho watched TV. Masks stop 100% spread. dad masked everywhere go covid. trying imply people don‚Äôt want hear go live life??? would wager asked Fauci today safe kiss someone HIV, would still caution it. states relaxing restrictions even blue ones. Movies? get see movies world? world allowed barring 1 hours exercise . clearly living high life! join you? news, scientists discovered ground wet rained.  quote tweets comments *chefs kiss* Yes, we're still middle pandemic. 

This person saying *even pandemic over* they're going continue wearing masks forever. perpetuity. 

Again, context.

Do think Japanese folks going remain masked public forever? doubt that. grew 80's 90's. result youth pastors using Fauci's statements even then, well 90's, said kissing someone could get AIDs.

Fauci still cautioning kissing throughout 80's. absence proof one way other, Fauci said, ""health officials presume possible transmit virus exchange saliva deep kissing. presumption made extra safe.""  Fall many months away. Expect guidelines change situation changes. politicize thing. calling side Neanderthals fine. thing left state Texas dark cold week? Yeah, know    Thank God. I've asked once, I'll ask - what's alternative? EU member states trying outbid get vaccines first? weird vaccine diplomacy, vaccines exchanged currying favours countries?

Yeah - Germany France could easily get vaccines populations ‚Äì can't realistically imagine Poland, Slovakia Greece actually outbid pay even more, would push line. means sure ‚Äì would one country vaccinated, surrounding countries would barely start then. mention animosities would come it.

Vaccine diplomacy even worse. can't even imagine EU-skepticism would spark ever happened. 

Realistically, EU worst spot. Sure, US might fully vaccinated June/July, EU fully vaccinated September/October, let's pretend end world ‚Äì like we're going stay locked end. contrary messaging worse - tells people getting shot changes little. Risking have's nots fine comparitively. use eggs anymore include drifted strains vaccine. living Japan Korea right now? know they're still wearing masks 'just go shopping anytime' right now, even though covid much control us long stretch. Wonderful! Vaccines work. That's appears CDC say. even vaccine rates continue improve, likely well months 200 million vaccinated. Probably like mid-summer. told need cops....  there's spike Texas reopening goes without hitch next 3 months, admit wrong policy correct?

What say version science?  fact people Europe US see second rate vaccine tragedy peddlers misinformation ashamed themselves.

It shown effective single dose vaccine far. far produced simple transport administer (not mention cheapest).

It produces less antibodies mRNA vaccines wider t-cell response. produced university know **by far** vaccine currently available. Honestly public health messaging trash throughout this. whole don‚Äôt know yet latest **"" J&amp;J vaccine rising occasion ""**

*Graph looks like erection*

Company named **Johnson &amp; Johnson.**

Are phrasing anymore? I'm fine immoral wearing mask flu season. I'll get vaccine stay home sick, that's extent I'm willing this. think we'll get point, probably little Memorial Day, easily walk Walgreens CVS get shot without appointment. also probably mass vaccination sites almost unlimited supply could run 24/7 right staffing. deaths hospitalizations fall majority country vaccinated, it'll something along lines ""it's safe lift community restrictions point. Please keep mind still risk contract COVID end hospital chose vaccinated"".

At point highly doubt we're going hit herd immunity overall risk community minimal point early summer. can't put exact timeframe though, based vaccine rollout going reality (not projections) adjusting new mutations. Also, entire states deciding ""over"" recalculate ‚Ç¨ that‚Äôs amazing! happy :) know scientists never allowed make mistake change minds? That's science works! /s  accosted varying degrees.

Well... maybe management taken asses downstairs enforced orders perhaps hired security personnel who's sole responsibility mask enforcement instead dumping shit rank file. Yes, signifigant chunk West be. Because, someone said another thread, people misdiagnosed flu really common cold. makes people think flus bad. flu kills people. bad. flu much miserable cold. Calling Covid bad flu accurate, like calling gunshot wound bad accurate. 100% right, urgency point. Well, pretty much entire country 82% since winter peak. mean, really good news nursing homes seeing decline. hyperbole?  Wait second, get it. saying 16% dead February received two shots still died? firing majority teachers nothing PR contracts. logistics. Teachers college degree licensed state teach in. Fewer fewer people interested teaching, especially since wages stagnated long. Firing teachers would keep schools able reopen another year least. teachers find jobs, schools take lot time find qualified teachers. There's data proving better compare single dose each. like scene Lord Rings chance end throwing ring fire, it. Plus advantage Oxford builds twelve weeks there's much higher efficacy get second dose. Yeah, never get people aren‚Äôt even slightly embarrassed scared everything... see danger conspiracy lurking every shadow, it‚Äôs pathetic. many 1a/1b groups still can‚Äôt get vaccinated Texas due limited supply. One largest dfw suburbs closed waitlist month ago due overwhelming demand still 150k people list without first shot.

Everything bigger Texas, including brow bones  Hospitals could also simply implement strict triage measures change procedures strict patient limits, many patients mean simply triaging least number life years left saved rather burning healthcare workers. months, 200 plus million vaccinated, reasoning, hang 200 plus million adults ? Mask free? Exactly. get idea protect ones need first, getting stiff even allowing parallel processes weakens fight virus. also prefer protect need first, could vaccinate even people without delaying vaccination group 1 sometimes can't help think people understand seious global pandemic even experiencing first hand.

More likely becomes endemic need annual vaccines, maybe knock substantially meantime. audacity call another commenter rude proceed act childishly attempt condescension beyond me. 

And no, two still disagreed. August/Sept *is* summer. *you* even understand argument? Maybe had, wouldn‚Äôt dig guy‚Äôs comment history accuse nastiness you‚Äôre showing now. Blocked üëã think optimism warranted. predict see crazy surge cases. experts say exercise caution, likely lots people getting sick dying. still listen experts even give vaccine. Lancaster larger many states largest cities.

I've going beach since like June Baywatch run I've distancing. reason ok US adequate supply. delayed second dose strategy allows double number vaccines given people preferential anywhere supply issues. literally every person follow Terrace House (japanese reality show) hanging without masks, going restaurants, etc. CA allowed restaurants almost year, see friends, biggest outbreak USA Dec. Indiana opened 55 today Trump got vaccine. might let know that. Honestly wondering, need boosters like flu shot one...well two-off absolutely want Johnson Johnson vaccine. isn‚Äôt nearly effective death isn‚Äôt thing worry COVID. many long term issues people survived worry about. Ok...we need chat Reddit. Take look thread. bunch people saying AZ effective SA similar variants, country stopped using it.

A little half people saying upvoted time, slight minority downvoted. pretty damn clear people linking specific comments, presumably downvoting. 

I've seen ton flare ups sub lately whether AZ effective mutant variants, everyone argues provides relatively little information, starting look like become political Brits (vaccine nationalism) Americans (who appear think complaining hard online somehow ease restrictions faster).

This sub God damn mess can't reigned closed. would get experimental vaccine virus statistically 99.9% going survive.

Let remind you, flu existed every single year prior covid 0.01% death rate. math exactly same.

Look statistics make mind up. would prioritize vaccine that‚Äôs 65% effective simply requires one shot versus two? 

I think I‚Äôll stick 95% effective one. Thanks. Indiana mass vaccination clinics coming month Indianapolis motor speedway, Notre Dame Hockey arena, place Southern part state. 100%, local government allowed collect fines mask mandate violations still allowed mask mandates. lot counties cities continue mask mandates, think big differences mandates compliance mandates one area another. Governor Noem would proud ‚Äúwe need learn live covid‚Äù. love people say ""it's mask"" restrictions school, gatherings, businesses exist. never mask, Texas playing period.

Texas refuses even bare minimum Would nice could get vaccine though! I'm one eligible groups since mid January STILL able receive vaccine mean bandana isn‚Äôt effective hazmat suit?

Who would‚Äôve thought. problem political pressure anything. governor's mask mandate, much standing community enforce masks within business. Right, none folks getting vaccines yet That's great news.

Has recent talk many folks expected actually get it? Dude same, I'm going beat on, like boat current, borne back ceaselessly past. I‚Äôm thinking along lines. 

I‚Äôve read articles online haven‚Äôt seen read discourse general population people thinking since 2 vaccines dramatically better J&amp;J. 

I feel like asshole saying need wait another couple months get Pfizer vaccine J&amp;J will. 

I guess I‚Äôm surprised people aren‚Äôt saying thing. What's really sad:

NY covid Fatalities, including probable: 38,660 deaths. 
NY covid cases, including probable: 1.6 million. 
Texas covid Fatalities, excluding probable: 43,266 deaths.  
Texas covid cases, including probable: 2.6 million. 


And Texas never really first wave like did, exactly one year ago.   actual adult charge amazing. supposed :D  Even vaccinated? That's known yet. fleeting infected debatable. Plus, cases winter. likelihood losing large portion natural immunity prior virus burning seems slim. I'll tell what, texas spike, gonna see following. Lesgo!! YES! can‚Äôt wait. Bittersweet really. I‚Äôm sad people state won‚Äôt take vaccine. kinda happy get sooner thought. vaccines first came figured wouldn‚Äôt get one June July. long enough distribution ok, reason put vaccine every arm mass stadium vaccinations So, don‚Äôt think long covid anxiety. think clearly measurable symptoms linked covid long haulers (continued loss taste/smell, long lasting cough/shortness breath).

What I‚Äôm saying that, don‚Äôt think rule anxiety driven symptoms cases. lot long haul symptoms, particularly ones involving brain fog (which pretty vague umbrella term itself) fatigue doctors unable explain following CT scans, MRI‚Äôs, bloodwork, etc., could linked covid anxiety. blindly rule equally childish. reason sub, also see hysteria whenever someone brings possibility anxiety root cause *some* symptoms - really isn‚Äôt good evidence either way. I've really frustrated, essential worker entire time, seeing vaccines state going seniors. see. I‚Äôm really sorry you‚Äôre missing college experience - reason feel way. lurking posts college students talking is, heartbreaking. gamble whatever comes comes it. Unless variants going massively increase deaths young people (incredibly unlikely) going accept people dying covid long hospitals full. Give man company, he'll eat lifetime.

Man entire 20th century filled new innovations farming.  sad people think saving lives worth saving masks lives mandatory saving lives save life. Omgosh found im eligible vaccine today. Yay already getting it. Must huge relief People keep breeding covid evolves method replication vaccines protect us from. Sorry crush optimism. tickets see favorite artist August... wishful thinking hope! think Serum Institute also making Novavax vaccine. another company India making J&amp;J vaccine. United States past months ultra super strict restrictions outside California, even they've eased mostly. Many countries warm climates people basically conduct entire lives outside semi-outdoors airflow they‚Äôre fully outdoors. trials beginning soon. Agree 100%, hopefully employers amenable though, that‚Äôs biggest holdup. Immunity fleeting all.  Children roughly 20% own. Add adults can't get vaccinated seems unlikely actually achieve herd immunity.  SF ghost town many work there...but also can't really travel right now. SF still tourist destination lot people go city around bay area..those activities resume, likely going see city shift nightlife/non work forward experience. need bunch restaurants lunch forward business one works anymore? get sick get antibodies. Even conservative estimates, 3-5x people infected reported. means least 30% immune. Another 15-20% vaccinated (of course may groups. Either way, we're already approaching 50% country immune. Daily cases 50Ks short stall 70Ks, 200Ks. 

No matter slice it, thing winding down. So, business can‚Äôt mandate anything. realize that? know Im late anybody know taking vitamins affect negatively responde SPUTNIK V? Yeah live Albany wanted go Utica basically get one day within mins refreshing. Albany ones bit scarce findable. guess we'll open groups soon. Check article sourcing N95/KN95 masks: N95 KN95 masks available good quantities without gouging.

If get KN95 sure get headband ear loop variety. Also, find Masktite double sided medical tape - experience Powecom's seal reliably across nose, medical tape solves that.

Use masks 5 potential exposure events, discard. use, let air dry place 3 days virus containing droplets trapped dry viruses die/deactivate.

For typical shopping exposures 15-30 minutes worn properly, drive risk near zero. see anywhere I'm suggesting ""sacrificing social life.""

All suggested to, flu season, wear mask public, choose bit get take-out rather eating out, maybe try smaller social gatherings rather larger.

It's spectrum binary system.

I'm saying become hermit months December April, maybe make slightly different decisions months clearly cognizant risks. Congrats!! Hopefully gives peace mind least individual level - feel nearly worried going public days vaccinated. Hmmm something telling isn‚Äôt good idea. Disagree.

! RemindMe 1 month deaths/hospitalizations still declining.  Thank Post Trump PTSD tear rolling face. Thank kind comment. Depends state, CA, would qualified day teachers did, yesterday got emotional let us back parks CA here. There‚Äôs PTSD coming... July 4th probably first celebration whole country comfortable wearing masks.

But considering majority adults vaccinated memorial day, party doubt. US even use AstraZeneca? saying bad vaccine, contrary great, 12 week interval doses we're looking people getting full immunization June start next week, since Pfizer, Moderna, J&amp;J Novavax enough vaccines everyone early May even use it? 3 masks googles? Try Newsom Cuomo first Bet gutted never got gestapo

???

Please explain response? English. be? Strokes people known underlying health condition, happen.

I'd surprised nobody died stroke within 3 days receiving vaccine. discovered miracle cure preventing strokes. still can‚Äôt get appointments 65+ parent. government contracts fulfilled, assume Pfizer, Moderna, JNJ sell whoever want to. Hopefully. mean hasn‚Äôt happened yet. Like trump I‚Äôm going judge Biden actions Fall? I'm looking summer. ramp distribution efforts massive scale, absolutely it. We're 10% adult population completely done 30-40% yet want it. 

I'd imagine we'll done tiers 4 6 weeks actually begging people get within twice time.  us Canada dead.  What's compassionate comment, ""fine, get die, care?"" They're ton people predicting large bubble larger crash. crash occur, roll dice. Tomorrow? 10 years?

So general consensus lights come party whenever feds raise interest rates probably sometime 2022. may get decade... Good one boss.just cover shit power outage. hope people continue listen science keep wearing masks. Considering widespread ignoring regulations curious much impact spread people weren‚Äôt ignoring regulations already continue follow them. Good luck! unfortunate bit hanging bars likely expose Covid-19. Extended periods enclosed environment people around, wearing masks talking cos they're also drinking? Yeah...good luck that. Ironically, music festival safer cos attendees might need remove masks. least could keep entire duration even others don't.

I would like get back in-person socializing too, environment strangers. people trust keeping safe unexposed. Perhaps home gathering sorts. Pub even cafe? thanks, I've vaccinated. Yikes Right. Many people terrified Covid, might actually scared shot potential mild discomfort disease themselves. vaccine doesn‚Äôt let reduce risk spread, worry hanging friends, take annoying mask, travel without concern etc bother getting it? terrible tactic comprehension human reaction, I‚Äôm shocked Fauci one spouting constantly. Pretty par course. Anything distract power problems, amirite. Texas: ""hold beer"" state. people concerned kids making decisions based science? ""science"" say long term health impacts children. oh yeah...it doesn't...they know. Totally agree it‚Äôs much better platform Cool, thanks sharing ignoring lot things.

1) vaccine numbers available small, hard vaccinate it.

2) vaccination older, risk, less mobile population. going go slower.

3) far, two shot vaccines done, effectively cut number half EVERY vaccination, case anymore.

4) production rates vaccination centers still getting put opening, many slated ready month.

5) even figures right, every adult get vaccine. means plenty us want it. realize still wear mask. force others too. upsets even. Manaus strain (Brazilian)? It‚Äôs hot moist lung breath. makes nose run like good chicken noodle soup! Hell yes, party starts kids go back school deal remote fucking learning anymore. son stop bitching school reunited buddies somehow ended half hybrid. swear going sit NOTHING least week enjoy quiet... Don‚Äôt worry. think lot people come shit talking things ignorance can‚Äôt always tell people generally curious. happens lot every day lots us everyday get tired snark. deserve gold, stranger! would happened former guy still helm. Poorly. friend planning 200 person indoor wedding October. I'd like happen, think possible then. also 2 year old, despite wife &amp; vaccinated, still kid worry be. That's worries most.

I think people forget ending Children 2022 likely. absolutely transition period. I've coughs linger months flu/bronchitis perfect, 9th sounds good me. Thanks explanation.

I getting confused looking CDC guidelines lot seem guidelines exposure presumed negative result, ut offer much additional insight positive, generally asymptomatic Man, Senior Year HS best summer ever, enjoy man! safe, anything kill college starts. :) fair point  We're highest cases deaths raw numbers, we're top 10 per capita. handle pandemic well all, could've done way better. probably go get tested point. Probably towards end quarantine. CDC always cautious conservative degree think realize would think onerous. 

E.g. 1) eat well done burgers steaks, 2) frequently wipe doorknobs, laptops, cell phones flu season, 3) 1 alcoholic beverage day. 

This available website. attitude toward COVID different. weren‚Äôt elevated risk 2020 despite 100m people US getting Covid. no, kids elevated risk. Vaccines adults makes don‚Äôt worry kids infecting risk older people, nice, risk kids never elevated year even without vaccines. it. light end tunnel. Let‚Äôs hold little bit longer knowing we‚Äôre nearing end. Let‚Äôs give 4th quarter. Stay strong win.  Glad hear it. lost 3 people 50 disease. anecdotes. Yay! kind like wearing mask. covers half face least, maybe decide stay home cold flu symptoms Oh 100% none us leaving house anything. I'm worried safety positive diagnosis.

Mostly curious lack symptoms means generally okay keep distance been.

I've taking crazy serious since I've learned exposure without mask home anything, plus walk around disinfectant spray, spraying anything touch  Scared... psssft. called informed. Stop parroting conservative media talking points use brain. Maybe stay home rest us around you, pandemic not. I'm sympathetic situation. People know bad going be. Teachers often old enough vulnerable Covid. think people still sure badly asymptomatic people spread Covid.

I feel like schools monumental job lightning pace. But, going lot kids disengaged one getting back track did. don‚Äôt information front me, understand does.

Also, helps, great results variants. might tested variants around, it‚Äôs better others, know case J&amp;J. Lastly, it‚Äôs rumored side effects vaccine lot tolerable ones.

So it‚Äôs good lot different ways, perfect, ones challenges well. Nothing 100%.

Remember, perfect enemy good. Depends state People comorbidities massive portion trial, j&amp;j wanted lot people comorbidities trial show effective across groups. US affected pandemic, hear most. Plenty European South American countries least badly, worse. May 26th!! Exactly 364 days original scheduled. You‚Äôre alone. Going library study. Grabbing food afterwards. Maskless bliss... someday. proper college experience. I‚Äôm crying, sand eyes. twitch stream. Firstly, psychosomatic doesn‚Äôt mean real. Mental illness isn‚Äôt ‚Äòjust head‚Äô, real effects.

Yee haw! comments sound like famous last words. Good luck! killed AMC leaps got January. thought could get 5 10 X summer. Made 15X month. totally missed first read - mb. protection 12 days first dose according pfozer data. Israeli data shows likely get covid first 8 days vaccination, likely due people dropping guard.  needs discussed opinion. article written doctor concerned Fauci's inconsistent information. excerpt interview 60 minutes. Fauci lost lot public trust opinion personally think Biden choose someone consistent concrete goal.

Interviewer: There's lot confusion among people misinformation surrounding face masks: discuss that?

Fauci: masks important someone who's infected prevent infecting someone else. Now, see people look films China South Korea, whatever, everyone wearing mask... Right United States, people walking around masks.

Interviewer: sure it? 'Cause people listening really closely this.

Fauci: Right now, people ... reason walking around mask. middle outbreak, wearing mask might make people feel little bit better might even block droplet, providing perfect protection people think is. often, unintended consequences -- people keep fiddling mask, keep touching face. T_D also good one type comment Point shit like happens.. 63 year old men die natural causes.

Sudden onset dyspnoea 2 days vaccination likely cardiac nothing vaccination Covid. There's avalanche encouraging news today. really give rat's ass get since know three approved vaccines essentially mean going die almost certainly get seriously ill. 

Any vaccine today better alternative next week next month. got numbers Austin American Statesman says 1.5 million fully vaccinated I‚Äôve seen numbers closer 2 million. Texas 29 million people vaccinated population around 7%.

The perception vaccine definitely varies throughout state. parents, maternal grandparents, people know vaccinated. I‚Äôm rural conservative area, there‚Äôs depressing number people don‚Äôt trust vaccine. See that's always first thought too. think reason go route elderly may able navigate technology well order get appointments, plus less fortunate may equal access making appointments (via tech) equal access transportation said appointments would fall cracks missed long run.

But, two points factors, I'd 1000% open everyone train. clearly defined benchmarks/goals things, would certainly motivate people vaccinate generally improve people's attitudes. feeling governments media care less never ends mindfuck. Set fucking goalposts keep there. Enjoy summer college! good times ahead Fair still vaccines could used risk catagory whether 10 100,000 doses. Going numbers 500k 2.6mil doses nearly 20%, substantial amount. vulnerable mum found delayed vaccine would livid.

However saying that, directly impact mine partners vunerable UK scheduled vaccinated, find hard follow agree logic used (and elsewhere).

Anyway think worth much discussion, seen past weeks people strong opinions things really way knowing right path without access time machine wishing one way another Canada speed vaccines general move forward pandemic. Yes!! find another job even pays little less? Something enjoy? knew person used work quit pretty high paying job work doggy day care found enjoyable. work gotten misterable. said might go back corporate job eventually taking break while. Let's hope Texas dropping fucking ball rest us. one followed Great Enlightenment opposed prior occurrence referring :D Remember overweight high risk poorly dressed women saying need muh hair  mean yeah there‚Äôs variant it‚Äôs also seasonal guys father dying Covid? Would say same? hate bearer bad news, Summer 2022 going spectacular. announced today fulfilled contracts enough vaccines. mean everyone vaccinated May Biden secured enough them, logistics actually getting 600 million vaccines administered going take really long time. last 3 months we've vaccinated 8% country. We're still going vaccinating people well winter spring 2022. rate horrible, doesn‚Äôt improve vaccinations won‚Äôt stop another wave. Good job President Trump getting vaccine done quickly! Exactly suggesting possibilities ignoring science. zero evidence suggest variant would occur first place, yet are. multitude variants now, increasing transmissibility proving vaccines much less effective. pretend mutation would cause even worse illness death stance ignores science. great thing lot people probably staying inside wearing masks, need many people normal get vaccinated herd immunity. Breaking: Vaccines may meant do!  case looking forward 2040s Summer isn‚Äôt really timeline. doses. administered doses. 600,000,000 shots lot shots, summer still probably quite right. Maybe sick ass Halloween party though.   now, vaccines held reserve second doses scheduled patients, supply opens reliable transition time model.   Texas state positively rate 13.5%. Abbott uses +/- 15% threshold making decisions. opposed Johns Hopkins recommendation using +/- 5% safe rate. Oregon, everyone suddenly disabled child takes care grandparent. babysitter. lol Yayyy lucky bugger! I'm envious excited you! parents 55 56 Indiana scheduled 1st shot. They're coming! fall! I'm enjoying working home =(  Nah know talking about. Even though real weak Brazilians could afford going US past still afford it. People go past still can't probably go next couple years. definitely spend vast majority year getting worked bad things coming around corner, includes last 2 months vaccine distribution effort getting underway.

Every senior citizen family vaccinated, well 23 year old brother asthma, 43 year old father asthma, (8) aunts uncles. 

8 16 people hockey team vaccinated (random body young adults, underlying conditions, couple nurses/teachers) 

My point is, least area, seems like ton people vaccinated.  mean...people don‚Äôt generally go jogging elevators, enclosed, crowded space that's we've vaccinated 90 year olds first? 
 
My point southern Az getting vaccines keep hearing about. need get ugly. eh? That's amazing! üôå hear, none coworkers issues. California going allow people vulnerable conditions like cancer obesity bmi 40 (not sure that‚Äôs hard number I‚Äôm sure even 10 points makes vulnerable) get vaccinated. mom 61, obese height. mean I‚Äôm sure probably might hit 40 BMI close. 

Any idea vulnerable groups opening March 15th need letter doctors office get shot? able sign Go? would shame turn away barely walk is.

Two vaccinated people unlikely infect infected - you‚Äôre high risk, could potentially carry weight, hasn‚Äôt determined specifically much vaccines reduce spread, likely substantially.

Covid test before? Meh, probably necessary, makes everyone feel better, sure.

Really bad irresponsible sounding trip imho. got first shot today let tell excitement follows REAL lived almost five years kids young. still miss zoo. took every week. Best exercise outdoor experience!  balboa great too! know New Orleans volunteers call seniors set vaccine appointments, think great! finally got grandma Houston vaccine, took weeks checking essentially making appointment her.

Literally nothing holding kid back living full life instant. hear rumors PA thing. üß¢ I'm going downer -- vaccine supply end May mean consumed end May.  later whats important. missing people also tested positive 5/20 11/28.  many, many fewer people tested positive time period (not November though).

We time test result every test, could actually make precise line-up (with computer program) number cases separated 3 months try estimate many double-positive-tests we'd expect simply random. would 2,000 number, but...

Lemme think loud would calculated. day number cases. day find total number ""eligible"" cases double-casing, total 90 days previously. random (homogeneous protection reinfection), could take total number eligible cases, divide population state get percentage, expect percentage second-cases day. E.g. November 5 1,000 new cases, 1.0% state tested positive 90+ days November 5, expect 1000 * 1% = 10 second-positive-tests November 5. could sum days.

Colorado presents database several forms: case recorded day symptom onset, day test results, day data release. suspect criteria based day test results, would symptom onset accurate? 90 day offset is, course, quite arbitrary. benefit knowing relationship survived last year survive pretty much anything. talking chick claims she‚Äôs ‚Äúscientist‚Äù said ones works said pandemic going last 27 years. it‚Äôll be? stopped looking shit lost hope due ex friends going everyone else doesn‚Äôt wear masks. exhausting post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

However subs, mainly city state subs specifically r CoronavirusUS far doom gloom, sold worst yet come, sort optimism irrational makes problem worse eyes. Anything doom gloom seen valid opinion sub.

In general, lack nuance comes discussing COVID, year. disappointing unexpected. isn‚Äôt flu (at least older adults, less deadly kids teens). isn‚Äôt really relevant. issue public health officials mislead public campaigns like ‚Äòtwo weeks‚Äô, (Fauci) still insist vaccines mean nothing we‚Äôll distancing masking years come.

As long happy FL good could never visit state. love cold. seem incredibly fucking dim. adults vaccinated children science based reason avoid family gatherings.

J&amp;J could depend booster shot trial looks good then. might want hold back. nice. I'm proceeding small wedding fiance's mom's backyard mid-April. 

Social distanced everything, masks, etc... 

But even now, half 14 ppl attending going fully vaccinated, something never thought would possible then.

Mind blowing shit man.

We still adhering everything safety first, knowing many people vaccinated makes feel better everything. get wearing simple piece cloth face got people hot bothered. expect science magic get mad start blaming ""ivory tower elitists"" never said magic first place 77 year old mum want encase effects fertility?! lost me. understand CDPHE data correctly, 822 reinfections August 20 February 28, representing 0.19% positive tests period. missing something?

Why double testing vanishly rare? get Covid twice I'd get tested twice unless symptoms trivial know it. imagine there‚Äôs going lot we‚Äôre vaccinated start safely stuff groups again. Floridian, I‚Äôll say state; kids going heading beaches spring break. theme parks probably seeing surge mention recent CPAC.

My mother lives beach Clearwater. Thankfully getting 2nd shot next week.  Sir, Wendy's. really think people took seriously large enough scale. president United States mostly downplayed (to cheers) took ""seriously"" suited him, downplaying again. 40 percent country thought great. 

You're talking 40 percent never going side anything. think going start tired shamed questioning solutions obnoxious, shame intended. believe scientists experts correct, believe? ""common sense"" masks somehow cause virus worse? president demanded states relax safety guidelines tweeting ""LIBERATE MICHIGAN?"" 

There many experts said different things, though think posting would get post removed ""misinformation"" even though come reputable sources (and I'm seeing story brought toxic version sub tonight, seeing votes, I'm going chance possibly, experts always get everything right, changed guidelines advice learned (which people also used wedge distrust everything). know I. knew Uncle Fred spouted total bullshit Facebook nonstop. Meanwhile, people like Fauci kind political villains people. actually got boos CPAC past weekend. actual fuck.

You're considering conference measuring stick. Mr 40 percent keynote there, tell need know there. mean immune criticism, mean left wing person can't criticize responses side pandemic, either. seem forget here. political villains, like always acting good faith, either. People criticized sub got voted. firm surprise seeing utterly toxic sub one year ago (which hope happen TONS people doubted virus real. tons still say accounting trick (""there flu deaths ... hmmm!). 5G craziest end spectrum. many walked around crowded streets without masks, proudly talked taking freedom stores, act like governors actually wanted close states political reasons instead worried people fucking dying. 

The concern ventilation indoors, concern indoors out. less chance catch outside in. fine message this. That's we've see several studies transmissions occur far less outdoors inside: 

And legitimate concern elected officials using sensationalism garner support, tech companies adding financial gain. actually genuine concern. 

Plus, see crowded streets like are? called walking around without fucking mask around people. goddamn simple thing scientists, multiple studies, know best way slow thing stop new variants. Jesus, understand resistance right thing compassion people lost family members (like did). feel shame that, it. tires hear it, fuck off.

Wow, hostility final paragraph!

First, chill! attacking lost family member mocking way? I'm sorry go that. hard enough debate matters stakes high personal, especially someone paid ultimate price. get it! never anything post disagreement people took virus seriously.

Second, friend mine family caught COVID, too. Thankfully, family, included 1 year old, recovered. fear must done something wrong could sworn everything right, thus, felt like failure. blame one thing thinking like this. media officials constantly shame ridicule people, constantly told must done caught it. horrible getting it. lasting sting mental health division us sown throughout entire ordeal. personal us. Science something put tests, counter studies, chance look them? hear someone saying could flaws study think right thing might work, hear instead screaming one another? Looks like we‚Äôre back track cases decreasing, even testing increased quite bit. Good news. Christakis brilliant. first one predict could model bad behavioral issues sentiments giving rise chronic disease contagious diseases. tools everything. 

Think this, obviously obesity caused specific infectious agent. catch fatness. peers, coworkers, family friends sedentary overeat likely same. fitness focused friends health nuts better. fact risk strongly affected closeness contact, exactly expect something like flu.

Dude titan epidemic modeling. sooner unfortunately loss life would lot less.

Vaccines always end game. gather enough them. everything seen read experienced, personally scared COVID anymore. wear mask people are, people vulnerable, afaic harmless me.

I wonder many people alive lockdown also sheer lack traffic accidents though. doom gloom. Lives spared 2 year old gotten much fun stuff winter way worse. good weather days go park bad days indoor locations go.

Museums, science centers, malls, etc. Everything I'm dying for.   really vaccines already required school attendance. Gov could easily say fed funded schools must require kids vaccinated.

Also, deaths per capita, Florida 28th, even top 10 top 5. state refuse listen 'the science', got fairly well. well this, **state wide** restrictions, mean counties cities laws common sense tells reinfection run millions, would protection low 80% 90%. Unless reinfection trivial they're insignificant. case, cares?

I'm seeking find evidence anything -- except actual rate reinfection. Health authorities understandably trying keep message simple: ""Get vaccinated"" appreciate qualifying previous infections (real imagined) muddies message. I'd shoes.

Some real world data giving us idea real reinfection rate.

 [CDPHE adding second-infection cases data dashboard | Colorado COVID-19 

This shows two things. (1) real reinfection rate much higher scientifically validated rate (see link below); (2) reinfection rate low (0.19% study).

The reinfection tracker added data:

Here‚Äôs think much better chance happening. big tech company, maybe like Apple, creates app lets show someone you‚Äôre ‚Äúconfirmed‚Äù something, means you‚Äôre either vaccinated COVID, medically unable vaccinated. open app shows bright green. businesses way knowing details, Apple company trust personal data. already protect lot personal data consider much secret, literally sued FBI gone court protect user‚Äôs privacy, massive financial incentives harm public reputation revealing anyone‚Äôs vaccination history without consent user approval.

A system kinda like would lot initial public support use, appears trustworthy. People would love use return going lives, businesses would use open quicker. six months, think anyone would continue require use it? think good chance temporary solution temporary problem. June 1st? MDW everyone going like bat hell. potentially four months almost everyone vaccinated.

Here's hoping. It‚Äôs ridiculous, don‚Äôt wear seatbelt law, value life. case others directly affected choice. 2nd doozy, prepared possibly miss work next day! I'd argue least act deterrent. Arm  slow process. 

Data reviewed properly decisions made based data. Give time, certainly change opinion studying new data.

To honest, would much less noise everyone AZ (or Oxford idk) job properly test phase. shit show vaccines. Well 25% people 16 need get vaccines even approach herd immunity. It‚Äôs like miracle, went away.  wait, yall havent partying? life hasnt paused one bit last year know going happen. Sure, majority won't. Us Americans strange bunch. It‚Äôs Great Gatsby reference Well course explain [recent Florida? 80 degrees here.

(Yes, know going now) shit that‚Äôs vaccines work anything, it‚Äôs signal soon groups may able start getting doses would want go watch Black Widow time, fuck man eating popcorn seeing Scarlet Johansson kick ass seems awesome right lmfao. Thank god somebody sense. 

All morons talking celebrating weddings early may we‚Äôll see another spike ends. 

Having enough supply doesn‚Äôt mean everyone even get first dose end may, let alone doses fully effective.

If there's trillion people earth, mean hurt someone love dies preventative death? see data country, missing something? I'm looking page 18 Depending high infection numbers rise things opened up, thousands young healthy people die too. top that, long covid happens also mild infection, hope still keep infection rates everybody (including kids) vaccinated. Almost there, almost there!! What‚Äôs ratio people speed compared people get fined speeding? vast majority speeders get fined. ""they"", I'm salty Chicago opening bit fast (we're still pretty cautious though comparison), I'd like industries opening able access vaccine prior reopening, close happening pisses can't wait weeks. world think still 6-12 months.

Well jaded Southern Californian isn‚Äôt holding breath. We‚Äôre far behind I‚Äôm expecting ‚Äúqualify‚Äù vaccine fall &amp; actually able get sometime 2022. UK gets award book. living rent-free head.

Dont let them. state started vaccinating teachers... ya choice get paid work. stay home hide want. need protect current situation. businesses mask / entry policy want. like people walking barefoot Instead responding content argument, criticized demeanor went far looking unrelated comments he‚Äôs made past attempt attack character, still avoiding meat argument.

Do seriously think that‚Äôs healthy way debate? Lol could people pulling money time actually lead minor economic downturn. Goes back public opinion though. festivals happens groups would attend refuse due optics? need wait disease totally eradicated human race don‚Äôt believe you, don‚Äôt live Florida. happened September? they're essentially vaticans representation area population congregants look authority figure placed church. absolutely pope endorses vaccines

If someone company started publicly pushing position contrary official position company, one dangerous point possibly resulting deaths, would fired *so* fast. 

Not though... could compare Mississippi's future path Iowa's path past month.

Iowa removed restrictions early February.

Cases explode. I'm talking governors I'm talking CDC, HHS, Fauci Yet state still vaccinating teachers, front-line non-medical workers, asthmatics, etc. here. College gonna movie.  Agreed - live Austin everyone mother losing minds. truly don‚Äôt think anything change. Businesses still going require masks people diligent continue Yet nutter replied lol. Sorry calling is. Telling nut jobs get vaccine political. imagine college, spending years working towards degree actually care about, finishing online. Plus there's added pressures find job, also online, make time $$$ worth it, makes college applications look like cake walk terms time commitment. been... interesting, say least.

I really feel HS, though. know help moment, worth getting jump college (if that's path) hopefully great. Freshmen already socially excited moving new place new people, can't imagine eager people socially deprived year. don‚Äôt know whether immunity keeps spreading COVID.

If I‚Äôm vaccinated there‚Äôs still possibility spread someone winds hospital ICU...  least even one shot you‚Äôre still pretty damn well protected  sometimes people selfish ignorant need government step in. know extreme example, know murder wrong, yet still need government enforce rules protecting us it.  lesson is... Eat company?  Yeah, like secret stockpile vaccines people could using instead!
Better vaccine may may good others vaccine all. hold school teachers take summer possibly restart person school fall. friend school admin told private Scamdemic true, secluded friends year means natural default state gelatin mass armchair growing back neck... Florida ended restrictions back September. IIRC 84 vaccine candidates one point, like vast majority effective enough. hear ones made - survivorship bias. mean, I've gone camping unvaccinated friends none us tested beforehand one got sick. Camping perfect COVID-friendly activity. outdoors, incredibly easy social distance, going around people...it can't get much better that. friends vaccinated, got leg up.

I clearly much higher risk tolerance do, probably super reassuring say safe, really...camping two vaccinated friends basically safe gets, far seeing friends goes. mean... June definitely still pretty touch go. enough vaccines end May mean everyone vaccinated then, manufactured. assume logistics pretty good then, amount time needed transport vaccinate people. two weeks wait vaccinated actually fully effective, still make big (indoor) plans June.

I think optimistic December though. can‚Äôt believe yet. I‚Äôm hopeless. vaccine family trip already cancelled July Airbnb host cancelled us due Covid. haven‚Äôt able gather I‚Äôm going crazy. hope true everyone around saying things won‚Äôt normal 2024. don‚Äôt know believe anymore Exact here! ENJOY! US given Africa $80 billion worth HIV medication saved 17 million lives since Bush office. even include US efforts fight malaria, tuberculosis, guinea worm, measles, etc. around world.

Check see US amazing things promote world health. Good question, I'd assume they're probably eligible considering they're educators. guess fuck workers don‚Äôt choice cope exposed hundreds maskless patrons day pandemic mandates dropped prematurely. 

The world revolve around you. I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre tired pandemic doesn‚Äôt change reality. South Carolina opened teachers school staff, well 55. Among people. means entire family either gotten vaccine built natural immunity. I'm teacher, parents 56, second oldest sister guidance counselor (school staff), oldest sister BIL already vaccinated healthcare workers, younger sister virus first 2 weeks year. I‚Äôm NC got shot past weekend. varies lot county. area NC in? 65 essential workers?  almost suspect OP paid counter-troll easily caricatured extreme position order promote reverse. Congrat! still can‚Äôt get highly essential job ü•≤ like Biden it‚Äôs pretty clear he‚Äôs saying we‚Äôll enough say everyone vaccinated then. Distribution centers nightmare get appointments. long drawn promise. college professors? Date twins!! everything? Thanks üëç sucked in. Germany rejecting it? Lmao. try feed propaganda foreigners. think last many desk jobs allow workers wfh sick. believe means limited indoor business operations like movie theaters gyms such. 

Glad I'm rush enjoy things I'm vaccinated. see thing here. state‚Äôs mask policy dead county still one. recently went rural town work purposes. planned grabbing bite eat brought snacks since food allergies, case. Literally pulled parking space downtown saw couple women emerge local pharmacy unmasked, distanced. decided hole office, eat snacks gtfo town soon could instead. ""has side effects Pfizer one""

The side effects covid far worse upstate NY, word superintendent's office nearly whole district (teachers staff) least one shot. plan elementary kids go back four days week two end month. There's light end somewhere! Yeah NYC access car, might take time. think people going access much sooner though Well shitty experience. think Disney clout pressure Newsom, they're ramping up. It‚Äôs better Wyoming I‚Äôm terms opportunity things certainly would like leave. Dallas fun fun run out.

Definitely going explore options company stores many awesome cities it‚Äôs automatic livable wage anywhere want aside NYC January 19. I‚Äôm fucking Sorry okay? going happen, least US. 

The best hope increased acceptance staying home sick (and importantly, employers actually allowing this), people getting flu shot, perhaps wearing masks go public sick. 

But masking mandates social distancing applied across board every winter moving forward even there's active pandemic? way, say someone big advocate masks distancing pandemic - governor tried would voted next opportunity, rightly so. mind increased hygienic standards essential public places like grocery stores, end day, gotta assume level risk live fulfilling life. I'm personally willing risk flu, higher mortality rate viruses like Covid.    people seem think AZ second-rate vaccine? - there's data saying good Pfizer terms cases requiring hospital admission.

While Germany's drug authorisation officials good reason recommend Oxford 65s time, data now. Surely point, vaccination going snail's pace Europe, vaccine better vaccine? I'm sorry vaccinated... EVERYTHING safe. 

Otherwise, way this? üßê Silly Billy hawkseye changes unfavorably


""You understand understanding still evolving like virus, please respect science continue changes favorably


""THIS TIME CHANGING BEHAVIOUR, SURELY WORST STILL YET COME""


These guys change projections send 5000 doomsday alerts drop hat they'd sooner die dare admit data optimistic settles - safe go theaters time Spider-Man: Way Home comes out, I'll going Drafthouse Phoenix &lt;3 think also contingent getting vaccines general public therefore making parents comfortable sending kids person class. states they‚Äôve opened classes, majority parents (2/3rds) opted person learning time being. makes absolute sense. We‚Äôve dealing year, people willing wait another month two bigger portion vaccine rollout happening speak.

But ya, keep spewing boring, meritless, agenda driven contrarian cynicism.   Ok thank info that!  Germans' anger aimed government well EU completely foolish idea hand power procure vaccine EU. giving people concrete idea ""new normal"" actually look like, leaves free put place whatever scary, irrational ideas want.

I get saying even remotely possible? Literally right Texas going directly CDC many public health officials advising lifting mask mandates. Absolutely one knows ""new normal"" actually look like. public health officials describe think safe, restaurant industry describe think safe, governor's describe think safe, subject change moment going vary dramatically location. article quoting public health officials saying masks social distancing could still used new case spikes. 

The thing confident virus going eradicated year, we're going get accustomed living it, whatever means. Bollox. Maybe 1 person long reaction. 4 friends week flu. Bollox go CDC website someone want it...good luck convicing them. I'm sure time goes they'll change mind. know plenty people skeptical anti-vaxxers jumping get ASAP. I'd argue 1 year lockdown, rather everyone cautious disease taken many lives. goes back idea freedom point able take away someone else‚Äôs freedom. traffic rules well kill someone. Tbh seat belt rules Texas huge much infringement rights wearing face mask. actually protecting others preventing freedom taken away wear one. Since know pandemic. reason wouldn‚Äôt able go inside store naked. Why? ur taking away liberty able go day without seeing ur hairy ass. 
A good argument would would consider someone giving deadly virus purpose another person risk dying said virus assault? comes hiv. Fauci also lead charge 1983 HIV/AIDS transmitted touch. ‚ÄúThe finding AIDS infants children household contacts patients AIDS persons risks AIDS enormous implications regard ultimate transmissibility syndrome, routine close contact spread disease, AIDS takes entirely new dimension."" - Fauci

Let's make overly cautious mistake here. get vaccine wont die covid... get moderna Pfizer chances getting covid slim likely wont need hospitalized... get vaccines helps slow spread enough people travel gatherings. would 100% favor making masks mandatory public transport. Would reduce flu spread make us productive we'd lose less days sick home instead working. parents, grandparents, teachers janitors everyone else around calculation know. preliminary results margin error (95% confidence) around ~12%. puts range 69% 93% efficacy expected results full study, based preliminary results. Generally shower random people don‚Äôt think stink, logic No, happened biggest winter storm several years crippled like half country including parts New York 2 weeks ago, people couldn‚Äôt get testing sites sites couldn‚Äôt operate. Last week catch-up reporting that. Know know? death count ‚Äúspiked‚Äù sync. That‚Äôs medically impossible, proving beyond doubt data entry anomaly actually reflective virus. It‚Äôs still going much before.

There 4th wave. Okay Clungo. drag club elsewhere then, thank you. I‚Äôm saying could ‚Äòchange mind‚Äô China already said selling weird period everyone convinced ADE (antibody dependent enhancement) would cause 2nd infections kill us all, people claimed vaccine 1 year completely impossible vaccines took least 5-10 years, people said vaccines stop transmission, mink strain going end earth know change LA moves next tier? Gyms, dining, etc? bit fever.... Come Germany thought üí™come on, get jabbed whatever lads üëçüòé caveman's brain shriveled caveman politicized infection control, orange caveman said to, caveman understand enemy see. couple comes together last appointment day says ‚Äúshe already got shot somewhere else, it‚Äôs me.‚Äù damn shot going waste!

MA, yes. yes, ridiculous. Yeah, that's wrong.

The 18 year old lives society provides whole lot stuff him, participation society comes set rules. 18 year old head far ass see behavior directly endangering lives others, must forced stop behavior. 

This concept applies many aspects life, reason allowed e.g. drive intoxicated smoke cigarettes class, dismiss consequences actions saying ""It's personal responsibility"". answer anything want long rest group also vaccinated.

TL/DR. short people wearing n95 exhaust valve putting others risk wearing cloth surgical mask.

they dipped administration due weather, however currently pace catch within week. look daily trends. thought one time. Possibly tristate area + cali. least heavily encouraged correct. Counties enact restrictions. Abbott said press release told removing restrictions state level. live New York ... I'll believe see Hello,

I would like ask people help providing enough material proves covid19 vaccines effectiveness safety. parents sceptic brother positive, even want hear getting vaccinated. Thank advance guy 5Ger UK. argumentation strategy ""statement 'fact;' anecdote, anecdote, anecdote."" Nothing makes sense. massive desinformation campaing summer (when numbers low) claiming everything hoax pandemic. Since elections autumn measures unpopular ruling party opposition chipped versions ‚Äúnothing see here‚Äù. Ever since implement random draconian measures whenever virus flares sometimes immediately cut due public outcry. people confused trying best lot simply gave believe conspiracy theories. outside ever mandatory US? Well missouri, they‚Äôre sending many vaccines rural areas. population wants cases, literally local population.  they‚Äôre going waste blue-voting urban areas starved vaccine first tier priority  Abbott now, ‚ÄúWhat power outage?‚Äù I‚Äôm happy this! mom thinking would vaccinated time me, healthy 19 year old, could soon late March!! Yes, making bad joke. I'm excited college student things someone college 10 years. Drug dealers hmu Obviously opinion, suspect July travel open UK US. might autumn travel really opens US Shengen zone however. Hope I'm wrong second point, we'll see. Vaccine clinic worked last week 70 extra doses end day ran qualified people. needs opened people otherwise facing another bottleneck (and won‚Äôt vaccine supply) Watching states open giving many mixed feelings excitement concern. However NJ makes feel like we're frozen time. Cases really decreasing I'm concerned might backslide. Maybe I'm worried nothing? finally events look forward May - July want happen normally possible. absolutely wrong ignore physical symptoms ""just anxiety"", typically means refusing provide treatment (just calm down!), acting person basically making (they not). think important acknowledge stress REAL detrimental impact physical health, acknowledging happened past year, real stress occurs catching living long-term symptoms new disease exacerbate issue.

To answer need get point view anxiety stress legitimate medical concerns take seriously, needed address them. Basically need get point acknowledge comorbidity comes things treat alongside initial complaint.  gave one told to. No, anxiety. may covid either. never really able find difficult get appointment. acknowledge could unknown long term risks understand risk child??? Hell, let's take ""harmless children"" disease like chicken pox. children die extremely deadly adults.

We 2 best countries terms vaccinating population.

I‚Äôm UK job offer US since late 2019. due go last March I‚Äôm hoping year I‚Äôll finally get there. I‚Äôm getting second dose today, going brunch weekend one favorite spots, state ended it‚Äôs mask mandates.

We 2 best countries terms vaccinating population.

I‚Äôm UK job offer US since late 2019. due go last March I‚Äôm hoping year I‚Äôll finally get there. Lol ‚Äúundocumented‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean don‚Äôt ID?

No, still get ids without citizen. Getting near time open everyone. enough every adult May it‚Äôs getting shots arms, nitpicking group someone in. appointments going unfilled someone doesn‚Äôt poop enough times per day qualify wasting precious time. Who? ‚ÄúNone theatres gave shit wore mask.... magnited states america dammit!‚Äù NYE 2021 gonna banger century. Aight.

1) seemed implying wouldn‚Äôt see benefit(reduction case levels example) hit 75%. misinterpret? think things insanely better get to, say, 73.45%

2) herd immunity binary, it‚Äôs either/or. It‚Äôs better think spectrum/continuum. evidence graphs/projections case counts date site linked to. cases going drop quite bit get 75% figure. Whenever decide reopen, always group saying soon. people freaking Texas re-opening? Florida completely open months cases still declining.

Texas always re-impose restrictions looks like hospitals might overwhelmed. But, unlikely happen: significant portion elderly (who likely hospitalized far) already vaccinated, rest within month so. doses Canada already paid for? Never crossed border. think divide two since people need second shot. actual data collected well stop hospitalization severe illness peer-reviewed data regarding spread different variants length time booster shot. think they're trying create confidence vaccine. said even though might protect variants spreading still slow spread maybe stop people getting hospitals it'll potentially save many people's lives best got now. 

 like want read like data studies done always go New England journal medicine website Lancet . might little bit technical that's going get up-to-date science studies done they're taken 100% true lab studies that's found sooo ... dunno.. everything Dr fauci said far science-based excellent advice.  god sakes get medical advice politicians. go medical school.  Rachna Dhingra, public health activist associated Bhopal Group Information, alleged People's Medical College exploited vulnerability victims achieve maximum recruitments trial.

Peoples Medical College private hospital, nothing Bharat Biotech alternative lockdown would be? enjoy perspective laid out, still convinced avoiding lockdown entirely right choice either. lockdown still prevents majority masses getting virus all. Whether deadly variant, not, still kill people(especially older people). Surely must balance better way things. don‚Äôt believe things happen 100% one way other. sith deals absolutes.  Still difficult get burnol today. Run echochamber :) agree excellent news, fundamental problem calling scaremongering. Early pandemic blame media taking issue seriously, 48 states locked slowly useful stopping pandemic. appreciate reported preliminary findings mutant variants knew (and still learning) much problem going be. fact variants reinfect people newsworthy regardless.

I think fair say media overreacting potential resistant variant emerge sometimes happens viruses. also think sensing threat people there. want lockdown end, right that's largely behavior individuals businesses. saddens think political issue lost, ignores physical reality situation. 

Caution still warranted, afraid headlines individual reaction says something person feeling inside rather media doing. Consider many read headlines feel fear, feel informed keep eye situation. Let‚Äôs honest OSHA MIA day 1. Businesses go alone make policies it‚Äôs inconsistent nightmare.  added intentional asking public respect employees something simple mask wearing you‚Äôre tougher spot merely perceived following state mandates. become lightening rod.  largest grocery store chain pa proactive masks mandate strengthened ended dozen law suits weeks multiple instances employees accosted varying degrees. Meanwhile places implemented masks month later barely received reaction. AZ claiming better numbers too. America getting praised international community? I'm opposite side
I'll going anywhere near vax.
Anyone moans invited fk contact again. Anyone else notice hit lowest 7 day average months yesterday?

We nice 4 day 4th wave everyone worried about, dropping again...  definitely are. easy say ""I get it"" available anyway. Many said ones taking advantage loopholes like saying smoker states.

Also recent Harvard poll said 41% willing 23% said go at-risk individuals means they're OK waiting anyway.

You'd surprised many anti-vaxers actually vaccinate kids talk big game. ...Ok? distribution standpoint, still track may? say anything lockdowns? said masks, low cost, effective solution.

Two, country pretty much failed comparison comes Nordic countries. Sweden what, 12k deaths? Denmark comparison like 2k last checked? even remotely same.

If compare CFR rate (Case Fatality Rate) Sweden think actually worse United States, United States response clearly good.  clue watching video brought tears. genuine soul. considered war crime Geneva Convention.

Lmao always risk getting sick dying though. agree. include events like California megadrought, AI taking jobs global weather, see happy party.

But maybe event show need UBI, maybe we'll shoegazer 20's. Mask wearing dependent transmission alone. goal reducing serious illness. jiar bolsonaro trump worse. I'm still scared SA variant. Studies dismissed UK variant reduced efficacy. I'm waiting studies SA variant. Especially Oxford vaccine. unfortunately got lot hate even though proven effective. Fear mongering much thing. saw nees SA returning Oxford vaccines anf super scared ""But sure, let's totally reopen lift mask mandate.""  I'm stating opinion, someone weak immune system can't handle immune response vaccine triggers vaccine triggered it.

I understand point might gotten stroke without vaccine, seems much coincidence someone 4 days taking shot would die.

The vaccine may direct effect stroke, think safe assume triggered another mechanism lead stroke immune system already compromised. sounds insane, order I'm sure end game is. house prices went %30 year due working home allowing live anywhere still jobs. last time heard someone rich getting %30 raise? fuck going Austria now. First ignore EMA approved ages noe they're going real world data. probably right, thing happens grocery store wants this. ""my rights"" people go cause big fuss intimidate 17 year old cashier get paid enough who's responsibility anyway. Meanwhile, Canada.... start vaccinating people ages 50 September.

Please send help. kill hype train, real vaccines (Moderna pfizer) shit J&amp;J one still allows infection, reduces impact? concern: I'm healthy/active male early 30's. I'm scheduled get vaccine soon, never really afraid dying getting super sick. *am* afraid getting virus damage lungs affect athletic endeavors. evidence vaccine would help prevent that? seems reduced symptoms (or symptoms) would mean even get virus lungs would ok since infection never got bad enough damage them, sound logical misunderstanding vaccine works? Restrictions burden,

So getting sick dying. Sweden able less deaths last year still less restrictions Europe, even point restricting everybody's civil liberties?

A year life lost due lockdown/phyiscal/mental health/suidcide year life lost like covid disease cause years life lost people mean it‚Äôs store write policy‚Äôs, people selfish entitled, see point. This. accurate. Texas: ""Hold beer"" NEARLY hard actual government mandate.  Also depends idea ""safe"" wedding is. want make sure putting grandparents/older guests risk? want wedding worry masks distancing feel covid-related anxiety/guilt all? Date twins! can‚Äôt wait finally special day. Things finally looking up. negative way, looking forward eagerly tests vaccines SA variant. Exactly infact think would mainly 70s 80s sinfr they're ones first vaccinated. Plenty real world dats showing effectiveness want end get people stop things half assed otherwise wasted everyone's time. costs nothing, could get vaccine, prevent little bit waste, help us finish vaccinating population. Yes. is. optics making statement fantastic him, that's important hospitals brink collapse, one worst daily rise cases world 1% cases world happened here. country 10 million. Sweden lower deaths per capita countries like Spain, France, UK, Czechia, Portugal etc could go stop shitting country lockdowns failed. We're good much lower deaths cases also lot us states aswell lockdowns. Proving lockdowns useless combating spreading disease long term unless locking rest life. iowa basically never mask mandate minor restrictions dining. Cases pretty low. IDK. might overestimating impact government mandated restrictions. Sick ""when end?"" headlines. answer's always ""depends""... Maybe June 1st. :} think many Republicans going Alamo Drafthouse... people good taste film primarily. already supplied Covax. UN help there.  Genuinely interested think happen. 

You‚Äôre acting like Texas strict lockdown it‚Äôs free all. truth people weren‚Äôt listening mask mandates still gonna running around like they‚Äôve doing. people sheltering place wearing masks everywhere aren‚Äôt going magically stop sudden. Yes should. clearly shown regard members community going parties etc throughout pandemic. agree Texas throwing doors open yes I'm tired it. time start opening stuff. Every week hospitals overwhelmed another restriction lifted.

The plan can't *just another couple months even think opening anything.* Here‚Äôs wishing sleep!! ""Matt Blanchette, spokesman CVS, told Globe Wednesday company aligning updated Federal Retail Pharmacy Program guidelines making appointments available pre-K 12th grade educators staff child-care workers 17 states retail pharmacy currently offers COVID-19 vaccines, includes Massachusetts Rhode societies dark underbellies. better others keeping contained control. anyone interested international comparisons, 16k reported equivalent 105k daily cases UK, 512k daily cases US. Screwed understatement. Maybe, chance received Moderna vs Pfizer? chiming in, used go movies time weekday 3 PM show there's good chance I'd one theater anyways.

I'm sure depends live too. Yup I‚Äôm 22 Illinois got first dose yesterday cancer last year Except around 5-6% Germans vaccinated. enough make sizeable dent certainly enough cover elderly/vulnerable I'll glad stay out. state's still taking COVID seriously. year ‚Äúwe aren‚Äôt going back staff gets vaccinated.‚Äù  states called bluff started vaccinating late Jan/early feb. school employees, teachers. Districts unions CONTINUED push back going back.

Go ahead, mock me. may co-vid last March/begining April. digestion problems ever since.

Im sure theory reason people support bolsanaro along covid deniers power scared. unlike people taking seriously think hard able rap head around severity situation able accept gravity future, did, think would suffer mental break it. subconsciously protecting ... never liked crowds happened. hasn‚Äôt changed. There‚Äôs nothing wrong that, different preferences. Send Texas going need it. Hi. Statistics tricky. One needs look sample sizes 3 vaccine candidates. restrictions moment? UK variant old? miss it, way less aggressive... aware repost Wtf talking about? article cells, humoral immunity. mention antibodies article variants evade them.  Seems like comorbidities still valid priority signal - there's data back up. prioritizing based employment isn't. educators get vaccinated much like hospital workers plenty people actually routinely congregate settings getting vaccinated - big picture fine, mitigating harm ASAP perspective right sequence. Good. remember UK PM approving vaccine. Last time checked regulatory body MHRA JVCI cleared use also approved pfizer. make sound like phase 3 data actually phase 3 data go on. rejected 1.5 dose strategy went full 2 dose. real issue small amount elderly trial enough got covid hard confirm efficiency it. However noted approval assessment IIRC based results phase 2 similar amount antibodies across age groups nothing suggest going work them. EMA basically reached conclusion MHRA approved ages noted lack data 65+ nothing suggest work them. No. vaccines approved US contain DNA/RNA. molecules ‚Äúinstructions‚Äù build tiny piece virus (the spike protein). immune ststem gets know piece virus looks like, able recognize attack future.

It's come this. Yeah healthcare worker easy certify ‚Äúessential worker‚Äù much harder age way go Good way lose business. Well that‚Äôs good bunch idiots FB feed saying state needs like Texas open up. different place state mandated closures like California?

Given Florida worse outcome places state mandated closures, seems like panicking Texas ""reopening"" overreaction.

Of course wearing mask reduce flu deaths, obvious now?  Last time checked, Texas started whole Texit thing. Interesting stopped power went out. cut lifting restrictions except masks ""wait everyone 16+ wants vaccine access one.""

You're essentially saying subtract blue areas red. ever seen political map? Even Texas metro areas incredibly blue. [1]

[1] Texas scientific experiment, would canceled violation ethics. 

But politicians concerns like that. Looks like talked week, e.g. Gov. Whitmer press. conf. Yesterday outlined relaxations entertainment leisure venues, indeed give specific target criteria full, maskless reopening, Pres. Chief Staff Matt Yglesias's idea Feds give Gov.s date ""return normal blessing"", Gov. Wolf press. conf. today said ""we wanna get back normal quickly possible vaccines roll out"". 

Getting there. surge want hear about!! documented instances outdoor event super spreader. mask mandate last thing dropped. Places like South Korea pretty much open, people still required wear masks. used work Alex Sette. Top notch immunologist! funny agree label 'misinformation', looking comments 'user history see ""right"" been. Somebody inform Delaware. eyeroll. dare go cancel people's rights like that? risk outdoor dining transmission tables strangers, HUGE groups friends &amp; extended relatives gathering (often booking separate parties) conjoining tables. Management &amp; service staff stop patrons using restaurants large-group gathering spots. eating household small friends group fine, start inviting neighbors &amp; outsiders, bets off. article grating nerves. anyone else see glaring problem It‚Äôs become T-Virus  Good lol, live one. guess read comment backwards still think excessive use bots get vaccine 65+, long, long way general availability. 2 months seems insanely optimistic. time go quickly.  Looking pretty good 7 day avg going drop 65k might even drop 64k. 

Very strange 4th wave. Wonder 5th wave look like  something special.  Yes vaccines do.... Turn CNN homie. Get Twitter too, front page Reddit. Allll poison.   Good thing variants aren‚Äôt issue all, eh? think idea heckle woman. Oops? grew Texas. weep politicians home state. Great news. Forcing children wear masks day horrific idea. 30 million us lose power? don‚Äôt know you‚Äôre implying.  article aligned others variants Hah right joke. said perfectly. Fauci sounds like broken record can‚Äôt listen anymore. advertising vaccine hard public telling people get one end near. I‚Äôm hearing masks another year can‚Äôt return normal lives blah blah blah. idk bruh Whole thing's giant virtue signal people. reality certain countries hogging companies delay shipments countries taking vaccines.

Look UK. Astrazeneca enough export UK (not part EU anymore) opted keep vaccines in-house, thus delaying shipment EU.

For USA, get lot talk happening too. country, we've heard we've lost Pfizer shots supposed come USA.  Astrazeneca shots come UK keeping it.


&amp;nbsp;

I understand ""I'll mine I'll help out"" mentality, though. problem ""I'll mine I'll help guys summer"". world (india, covax) everyone getting certain Percentage. means country finished 1st 2nd, means world overall finished together quicker. Instead USA UK finishing April/May helping out, it'd like USA / UK finishes September rest world far behind either.

South Africa categorized Novavax [vaccine may suitable immediate People allowed make choices. Even believe bad. bothering second dose.  age easier understand, makes sense simply looking demographics hospitalized dying Covid. Indiana, age 60+ 93% deaths. switched age based quite ago it‚Äôs going well. Also, look Indiana‚Äôs dashboard...  Yes, actually goes along studies shown severe cases among type A's. May also explain countries seem getting hit worse others source says 4.5 million lost power together number ‚Äúsome‚Äù lost days. number ‚Äúsome‚Äù? You‚Äôre making seem like Texas without power days that‚Äôs case. Trump wasn‚Äôt even anti vax, okay. I‚Äôm pretty onboard lifting restrictions businesses. government shown incapable supporting businesses financially lockdowns, people hurting badly. It‚Äôs naive write pain lose businesses jobs due shutdowns reducing ‚Äúoh care economy!‚Äù. It‚Äôs nuanced that.

But don‚Äôt really understand removing mask mandates right now. hate wearing mask. It‚Äôs annoying it‚Äôs 100F humid it‚Äôs miserable. it‚Äôs minor inconvenience worst. Like... reason actually remove mask mandate right now? lock whole city outs ez never said testing means isolation tho. didn‚Äôt even imply it. work college campus; know better.  That's get many morons country: dumbass imbecile president still thinks hydroxichloroquine cures covid, agaisn't lockdowns agaisn't vaccines, apparently wants virus propagate. guy like gets power, disaster sure follow. matter many people die, many atrocious decisions makes, one third country still thinks Messiah promised Jesus... 

Now hope die, given new strain kills young people well. Good. Ban all. Turns protecting risk good idea. finish line control. exceedingly obvious haha. live California, also might wear mask outside/alone car.

The reason simple: home, lot time properly fit mask, including fixing tape etc., can't really sensibly remove time home. mean afraid catching Covid alone car though ... thing billionaire class Bourgeois class. Save SocDem Bernie shit someone marxist. Small businesses unethical exploitative large businesses. fact majority wage theft abuses happens easiest small businesses. also seem recall manufacturer threatening patient multi-million dollar lawsuit, reporting potential adverse reaction. That's really problematic, running clinical trial. Chris Murray insane, lol. figured 50/50 em im glad hear they‚Äôre well, im surprised texas slipped up, people charge always find way screw something up, Even snow storm wasnt here. Im guessing end March/early April general pop starts getting it/making appointments current metrics support decision, according state local health departments, well national experts. They're advised fact know big problem restrictions simply necessary. world makes lot sense turn CNN off. anybody know flu went? Get back find it.  Sure whole year still excessive IMO

I said that

I disagreeing implication testing means isolation schools going overboard requiring  don‚Äôt know it‚Äôs like Los Angeles, judging solely Georgia Florida, I‚Äôm guessing late March early April it‚Äôs going pretty much everyone 18 eligible. There‚Äôs many locations now, sit available people categories hours. Maybe add two weeks April 15ish larger metros blue states?

I‚Äôm doctor, epidemiologist, member government. I‚Äôm another idiot reddit. Millions lost days, millions didn‚Äôt. 

Nearly 30 million people live Texas, friend. *pokes cdc* hey update shit Won‚Äôt getting vaccines pointless nothing open get boosters anyways. Seems like stuck never ending cycle hitting 70% threshold needing booster vaccine. Yeah, sounds right. don‚Äôt to, many school boards still require them. still don‚Äôt agree decision least others stepping presumption made extra safe.

There's precautionary principle we've hearing much about. Didn‚Äôt sell company? current generation seeing in-person lecture actual crock shit.

This obviously anecdotal I've found exactly opposite true students. want in-person overwhelmingly asked return in-person instruction. I'm sure varies school etc. though. think suicides doubling one school district noticeable?

Using total numbers way compare coronavirus deaths suicides anyways.

Half million deaths Americans coronavirus barely 0.15% population. Based 50 million Americans eighteen attending school, half million suicides would 1% population. 75,000 suicides would equivalent.  would prefer phrased teenagers likely young kids transmit virus? There's number studies coming UK (one Scotland one England) vaccine efficacy time 1 dose. think right  hear anyone ever seriously claiming that'd keep safe. Florida fine, Texas bottom missed entire week vaccinations. Texas actually outvaccinating states. guess pretending everything fine now. Blame economics rather people. understand restrictions, someone needs hours pay pay necessities would agree me. Someone could work home, 3rd grader needs zoom would probably agree me. I'm sure person paid hourly would prefer take precaution, tell can't go work telling can't survive society right now. 

It occurred bitching people needing government provided childcare, already kids 5-18. 

The modern world built society based rev 1 economics. society requires participation survival. Restrictions stop participation endangers survival. fix this, need build society based rev 2 economics. rev 2? 

I support restrictions, comply, able that. need politicians break away old ideas society create new ones could withstand restrictions next pandemic hits. know. dumbasses could follow guidelines well could tell us exactly like is. many people whatever want overly cautious effective.  Floridian equally unqualified governor, condolences families deaths wait months. know pain repercussions uneducated partisan decisions.  


Also, make change first day opened vaccines teachers? whole new layer idiocracy! Critical infrastructure critical everything happening   blizzard knock powers, heard lot vaccines disposed correct wrong lockdown harder!!!111!!one! that's interesting thing South Carolina.. mask mandate, one lowest vaccine allotment nation (thanks feds), yet apparently one better distribution plans (meaning getting arms people faster). perfect worst. I'm bottom barrel, estimated eligible May Yes, like Australia intermittent lockdowns localized small areas instead hundreds thousands dead moderate lockdowns nationwide year. Abbott bout dumb af ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è way governor wants keep job mandate masks distancing every winter COVID gone feeling Biden Fauci keep saying ‚Äúmaybe need wear masks until
2022‚Äù see less less people care sure many times said, plan requires 100% compliance never work practice regardless much it‚Äôs ‚Äúright thing do‚Äù state worse texas? Anti-maskers last year, anti-vaxxers now. Pretty sure live Texas fallen news cycle. businesses ""list"" have? Patience isn‚Äôt without cost harm. well vaccines USA good, pretty much stop dying get covid. Beggers cant choosers vaccine available everyone, able discriminate won‚Äôt take vaccine...and Jews. kidding. 

But try incentivize people get vaccinated there‚Äôs nothing wrong making requirement people want non essential activities like flying, entertainment activities. Long live Alamo Draught House! went one first time base stationed San Antonio (2007). Midwest I‚Äôd never heard theatre could order food beer! could take growler beer home blew mind. Good times. Whoops, math failed me, thanks confirming! wish could hope something little bit better, terms freedom safety, rollout finished.

I understand anxiety. Uncertainty uncomfortable reality right now. honestly good things look forward to, terms freedom safety, soon. article saying surprised still wear masks distance future saying permanent curfews extreme isolation. better lock Billy Magic out! (Is human? get covid all?) Doh, looking old article States rights jeez.... State acting stupid, Feds rule them. way open ditch masks yet. Let‚Äôs get Country least 75% vaccinated first think lot people still wear mask despite rescinded policy. article situation, sources text get things, need involve people necessarily low risk? everybody else accept increased risk go concert?  Interesting. states also huge snowfall frigid temps recently? also shut week? almost full year pandemic can't figure wear mask without fogging glasses? Biden told states prioritize teachers end month get back classrooms. easiest fastest way get done. teachers want wait they‚Äôre eligible another phase try get one vaccines, that‚Äôs prerogative they‚Äôre offered vaccine really don‚Äôt reason refuse go back work. J&amp;J vaccine still 100% effective preventing hospitalization death, it‚Äôs good option. sadly option freshmen. get aid package deferring best means apply later. worst, completely ineligible package future. trials J&amp;J shown 100% effective preventing hospitalization death. teacher getting cold-like symptoms week really problem. need get vaccines people's arms. like shocking states usually ranked bottom nearly every metric, ranked bottom again. people get vaccine help protect everyone flu. CDC flip flopping position masks.

They changed position exactly once. recommendation originally N95 masks kind mask protected wearer.

Then, data came asymptomatic people could spread disease. also data non-medical-grade masks could reduce viral spread *from infected people*. Since know infected, make everyone wear masks, reduce possibility asymptomatic person spreading disease others

They changed recommendation learned more. exactly want health organization? would much worse made recommendations based evidence  Blizzard shut roads lot power plants froze blackouts. Living Texas, really wierd read actually places taken covid seriously past year. know exists havent really noticed major differences. Ive wait outside past year bank. Everywhere open, packed, half people wearing chin diaper mask all. major differences ive seen LOT businesses shut down, shitload people unemployed. care? You‚Äôll get JJ. one stopping you. work home, couldn‚Äôt care less waiting another months. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è great but...

Who cares? Seriously. worth article? god.

Would day less worthy known information? Canadian government changed mind approve Chinese one approved Pfizer Moderna  ""So take 12 credits maintain enrollment."" Yeah, 12 credits costs amount 18. It‚Äôs already free NJ. know someone (very serious, bad pre-existing condition) got vaccine yesterday. didn‚Äôt ask many questions signed up, didn‚Äôt ask proof. It‚Äôs Antarctic variant I‚Äôm worried about. little fucker must tough. cant base sustainable, long Term, public Policy variant fragile, uncontrollable unpredictable humanity's behavior... 

Any policy stakes high doomed fail tried. university said took semester off, let alone year, would lose scholarship currently covers 70% cost attendance. I'm going graduate degree microbiology microbiology research experience one half micro lab courses (one half online). Shit's fucked. Rarely kids get flu vaccine Weird...why shut week weather? hurricane? Hahaha fair point. I'm analyst real life: job calling life worry things people never even stop think about. :) news Alamo declared bankruptcy. worst atrocities occurred throughout history started kind thinking. Funny ask. [This published find fellow scientists always appreciate incredible, quite frankly refreshing, meta assessment every topic. Natural immunity pretty comparable vaccine immunity. 90s, better many vaccines. main advantage vaccine immunity needing get Covid, gives higher levels protection. that's lifting mandate god-damned stupid idea. What?

Virginia used 79% allocation. They're around middle pack - bad, great. What‚Äôs Super Bowl spreader? told would guarantee increase cases pretty bad article can't imagine wasting Fauci's time like could write doom piece Covid. I'm also college student.

Fuck assholes think rules apply put others danger. can't follow rules attending. 

Nobody getting plane traveling pandemic. called *lockdown* reason. started...

DR. OFFIT: ""If mask social distance every winter, see dramatic reduction flu, usually causes hundreds thousands hospitalizations tens thousands deaths"" variant proven vaccine immune response resistant seems safe say shouldn‚Äôt afraid. default last months seems assuming variants vaccine resistant. proven be, honestly never made sense variant could avoid way cells identify virus. 

So, going forward I‚Äôd default variants concern proven otherwise. guess need world war... probably happen OC live. actually two categories Orange, cases still purple territory. question long lasts. Super popular fund /during pandemic, 10-15 years someone proposes budget cuts austerity? reserve capacity never gets used first go.  worried experiments don‚Äôt look antibody dependent infection. 
We still don‚Äôt know reason additional mortality Manaus. they're minor character show every person got vaccine. still stop watching? special effects guy get vaccine? main characters vaccinated director isn't? everyone whole production vaccinated movie studios executive get vaccine?

Edit: also realize there's gotta least million celebrities different sorts country alone? That's ridiculous amount people keep track time wasted spent reporting things actually matter. people deciding lives based celebrity need reevaluate life stupid buzzword people want put heads sand pretend there‚Äôs nothing worry about. 

You even look article, you?

I'm trying draw balance without shouting either void. waited full 4 months without second shot, though. still anecdotal, know enough new variants: South African, Brazilian, Californian, new one New York, etc.

I want believe - also giant-scale experiment entire country's population. they're right, yay. they're wrong, it'll get pretty bad. capabilities produce vaccines moment (lots political finger point that, wont get it).

Our vaccine source EU shut plants help upgrade facilities increase production. We're getting lot doses right now, soon gonna become issue distribution previously supply.  issue bit complicated. people private jets appear highly unethical, innocent. South African mutation appears reached Tyrol two transmissions outside South Africa, compare [this (DeepL works well it). UK does. 
Also Faucci financial stake Moderna - might influence desire mitigate liability them.   likely scrap tiers sooner rather later

We already basically have.

Biden claimed vaccine got dose üòÇ  Well, that's disagreeable situation. Well trials proved vaccine worked not. Extrapolating working vaccine still work give booster shot later tested significantly different starting use untested vaccine.   novel virus vaccine understanding constantly evolving, yet questions frowned upon dismissed anti-vax. make sense either also filed bankruptcy today announced sale.

Let's see new owners continue policies public interest likely affect sales numbers Texas. husband can‚Äôt wait go back. WFH kids home time been...challenging (to put nicely). friend whose mother died COVID two weeks nursing home was
vaccinated. racked guilt pulling taking leave job care vaccine came. Sorry, points added incompetence maintaining power system cold weather. COVID, high ground lol. already known outdoor transmission minimal best [This government official website see covid numbers. already updated data matter anyways backlog production, may well safer  case people really need wear mask walking around outside ?  Thankfully    Covid transmission could 100 times higher right now, still change fact fully vaccinated people interacting safe going be. 

If not, there's nothing left us. constantly said article AZ J+J. come often can't miss it...  Wes Pegden twitter yesterday, believe, disputing putting Manaus numbers perspective. mention realized different demographics Manaus infected two waves downvotes? said wish *would* live Texas. means live Texas. C'mon people. Ha, meant general sense. I'm still away fully vaccinated, looking movies releasing 2021 got excited. yes indoor. even NYC found little trace back restaurants tbh.

but know risk tolerance. Amazon providing infrastructure support get vaccine distribution 4D space chess make pandemic last longer make money?  states left report reported yesterday, there's still like 15k cases there, right. Florida hit genius approach reporting COVID cases. Source? global pandemic requires global response. Right wealthy nations buying vaccine stock, commitment stamp virus around world quickly possible. outdoor dining safe ?

Seem rare outdoor transmission occur Mask wearing common Sweden, no. also decide gonna well pandemic. city everyone wears mask way worse one one does.  work childcare I‚Äôm getting vaccine tomorrow CVS. couldn‚Äôt excited. called IPAC, suprise anti-intellectual pac needed basic health, safety, private property rules explained detail them. suprise understand. What? No, smart. Smart enough push agenda Yeah, think that's fair assessment.

It may gloomy sounds though. Israel pretty much 100 percent Biontech.

For Biontech efficacy low ~50 percent among old single dose, reach best class status 1-2 weeks second dose (~85 percent old 95 percent everyone else).

If people infected prior 5 week point, died partial protection. lot people get sloppy first dose, let alone second.

It's still really good news, even though deaths zero. biggest issue half population vaccinated Israel still herd immunity, anti vaxxers going point (drastically reduced) deaths vindication take vaccine. Millions lost power short period time, days say. I'd like take time tell people bragged moving Austin California..........I told so!!! emotional.

says person recommends social distancing staying closed vaccine. need come grips mortality. always 'some' risk life, vaccinating going back normal whether like not.  fully agree. going assume going plans place kind thing gets closer.  Correct, NY back March last year really know properly treat COVID. used ventilators much earlier progression disease ... know that. COVID hit Miami Houston first result would've same. much due snowstorm had? Would interesting compare vaccine rollout time next week. Lmao imagine sucking hard billionaires. 

Did collect money cell? know student suicides per capita could possibly equivalent coronavirus deaths per capita.

The article mentions known suicides doubling 2020, 9 18, Clark County, 320,000 students.  Ask senate

You help calling senators stating need aid instead complaining reddit  That's want. They're risk. plane ticket china early April following around mid January IIRC. Bought respirators ~1USD thinking could useful transferring Beijing. course go anywhere end :) Common knowledge due widespread local, regional national reporting. getting flu vaccine reduce amount people catching flu?

So even kids get flu shot personally still seeing benefits it. I‚Äôm excited you!!  messaging really far actual situation? all, vaccine ready immune response infection. nothing proactively ward virus way mask does. vaccine 65% efficacy definitely near complete level protection virus. see vaccine within context protection oneself, broader context directly relating herd immunity? achieve herd immunity vaccines, makes sense still wearing masks. point vaccine reduce overall risk, eliminate need mask use. would think major pitfall prematurely easing mask usage would anti-vaxxers wandering around maskless premise vaccinated not, would way tell. anything I'm getting?   Ftfy: sure political leaders know Neanderthals lower rate cult membership.   Yeeehaw? seems like Brazil though. even sure free will. beef China inoculated 1 million people coronavirus vaccines July 2020. vaccines barely started phase 3 testing. proven work hadn‚Äôt even proven vaccines safe yet. yet nobody spoke said anything. say foolish, Florida suffered worse consequences states kept strict lockdowns. Governor I'd wondering lockdown watching that. one ever said that. told people get flu vaccine year hospitals could handle flu top covid cases. probably actually educate flu vaccine making ridiculous claims. People dying covid, people getting sick covid, allowing emergent illness become endemic human population endemic worse make believe nonsense come with. 

Creating world illness death desirable people fighting concept fighting pandemic fighting future. Let guess, probably FrEe MaRkeT RePuBlICan...I love conservatives say shit company sets private rules, infringe anyone's constitutional rights, flip like little children want eat vegetables. Grow stop whining... Probably they're concentrated urban areas VA facilities vaccines supplies are.  Damn fr That‚Äôs everyone else dead. Since goal make informed:

For would actually recommend mRNA vaccine hesitant. 

- Since mRNA transient molecule, even stabilized one used vaccine survives couple days (regular mRNA lasts minutes). 

- toomanywheels mentioned, mRNA doesn‚Äôt even interact nucleus genetic information stored reason fear incorporating DNA.

- benefit mRNA vaccines fundamental molecule less likely allergic reaction protein-based vaccine (however adjunts still carry slight risk individuals observed safe setting vaccinations)

However wish give spot line someone wait-and-see reevaluate decision later continuing safe fair personal decision. Yeah, that‚Äôll help heal divide. advice Abbot gave us though? say wear mask, simply said longer mandated. cell evasion uncommon, actually. Viruses aren‚Äôt things it: cancers too. new immunotherapies cancer, example, resulted scientists working ways cancer cells hide cells. (Anti-PD-1 example this.) various ways hiding cells mutational escape (changing sequence proteins epitopes different) one them.

VZV (better known chickenpox) virus evades immune system well hang nervous system life: couple articles specifically looking mutational (SARS-CoV-2 - Note, preprint peer-reviewed)

This nice overview cells work, placed context COVID-19, case you‚Äôre though, don‚Äôt want come across fearmongering. moment every reason confident vaccines we‚Äôve got, even variants: work less well work, part reason robust cell immunity. chances fine. 

I sure would support ‚Äòat least well as‚Äô statement since conformational change (which doesn‚Äôt necessarily require change amino acid sequence protein) could fool antibody, equally point mutation (resulting single amino acid change) could theoretically keep protein structure make T-cell epitopes unrecognisable given cell. bear mind billions cells antibodies (or point, antibody factories, B cells), slightly different ‚Äòrecognising‚Äô abilities. 

I‚Äôm immunologist (or was, long ago) I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôd willing able say ‚Äòharder‚Äô. rate think leads us dangerous road over-simplification: defence virus requires coordinated response entire immune system, antibodies cells part. GOVERNMENT CANT TELL WEAR MASK!!! No. likely get Covid. likely die it.  correct wrong texas cities still going wear mask without mandate believe Sweden even mask mandate want wear mask? move Texas, then... CDMX right now. quite nice. Enjoy. gf gets second dose tomorrow (teacher), parents got second doses last week (old).  

I'm going waiting month two mine, feels bad left out. Kind bummer. high hopes virus. O'well, back praying Rhode Island size Meteor hit Earth. says hi, btw. Interesting condescending cunty comment acts social distancing big deal, fact it‚Äôs enormous sacrifice millions people led massive nationwide mental health crisis That's bullshit, point past 6 months least anyone honestly said ""this month"" necessarily true. encouraged NY get tested general. I've tried regularly get tested know I'm asymptomatic. That's true what's happening adjust life. Keep distance people wearing masks. shit probably comments reminding people interim results too? mean, find useful comment hedges expectations, otherwise reaction hopeful one! yay new vaccine Hard disagree. 9/11 one day event, centered one country. Sure, world may felt effects, mostly moved on. US, 9/11 wasn‚Äôt long impactful event. Even US could argue wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúnorm-changing.‚Äù

COVID going solid year, across entire world, affected, almost literally, every single person entire world way. Even WWII didn‚Äôt impact, poorer countries left out, country escaped COVID. 

This defining event lifetimes (hopefully‚Ä¶. Assuming another pandemic doesn‚Äôt occur), 9/11 big event, life defining event. Premature Abbot. partners probably complained also. Florida vaccine rollout guess I'm thankful JnJ somehow perceived way. Adenovirus-based vaccines pretty much novel mRNA vaccines grand scheme things. first human-use approved adenovirus-based vaccine ever. Adenovirus-based vaccines clinical research done bit longer mRNA ones, hardly traditional. 

Ironically cause action fundamentally - adenovirus-based vaccines complex delivery mechanism thing (a virus carrying specific genetic payload get cells produce mRNA produce said protein, rather dropping mRNA directly cell sneaky lipid package like mRNA-based vaccines). 

Novavax's subunit-based vaccine first truly traditional vaccine (throw random proteins and/or virus parts hope body makes immune response). 

To clear, vaccines approved use safe. saying adenovirus-based vaccines ""traditional"" gets people comfortable taking it, I'm it. they're traditional vaccines. Guess going AMC instead. appointments 6:45. really sucks last appointments call / show. scramble find people store see want it. Ga, automoderator ate comment. Let's try story different link:

They still do, strep kills half million people year, often causing heart damage repeated infections, largely areas limited access antibiotics resources limit spread US, average age retirement 61. I'd like see statistics many 60+ year-olds *can't* retire. Give mine someone else...They need Brazilian here. Bolsonaro vetoed yesterday law would allow governors buy vaccines directly. still mocks use masks calls lockdowns useless means fight Covid destroys jobs economy.

Seriously, wish U.N. active caring human peoples Bolsonaro could taken judged crimes humanity. Unfortunately kinds trials never done western leaders. Brazil never anything him, many us think like (long story corruption, lack faith politics rise saviour). badly need international intervention.  It‚Äôs largely states really Yeah criticized Indian government approved administered vaccine many people completing phase 3. like Russian Chinese vaccines. criticized Indian vaccine. frustrates end. Also, kids parents combined 3-4 jobs, can't raise kids without dropping 8-12 hours day concern anyone?

Nobody around was. fact haven‚Äôt seen single person sub complain told ‚Äú2 weeks‚Äù yesterday, think dropped pretty early places pandemic. rest year restrictions pretty much going indefinite. demonstrable end frame. 

It‚Äôs unbelievable people forget past year asked pandemic would end would get shoulder shrug. Would like study water wet too? sun hot? believe man, keep trying solve great mystery. best!   We‚Äôve got twice total deaths next nation total Covid death chart.

USA USA USA!!!  Every single person know getting vaccine. every time go talk people travel work, find people won‚Äôt get will. would think would done demo survey prior. glad government wasting tax dollars surplus they‚Äôll definitely have. college student, understand frustration anger, especially college students faculty last step state vaccination boards. know people live campus simply restricted living rooms.

Surely anyone say basically time history capitalism? month, certainly time wear *heavier* mask even lonely. little tongue cheek talking mate, talking comment originally replied thread. said America selling vaccines sort betrayal, agree ridiclous. think agree overall.  said another post sub got hammered. 

Schools opinion tier 1 essential reasons named . feeling teachers vaccinated there‚Äôs going another metric unions move to. variant called Bolsonaro-1

The virus born lockdown measures completely lifted Manaus, believed region reached 'herd immunity' stop using masks keeping social distance following Bolsonaro's insistence one needs it, claiming pandemic mostly media conspiracy bring government down. really reaching. Always look center arguments choices. Extremes either side sign undisciplined thought. would love live fantasy world 65 year-olds largely retired. think COVID vaccines might cause severe health consequences REALLY worried COVID, COVID vaccines made COVID. Another narrative doesn‚Äôt exist. Good job guys! really strong. need rate vaccine protects serious infections and/or death, though reason suspect less 100%, especially India already unusually low death rate. obese. Obesity starts BMI 30.0, that‚Äôs 197lbs someone height. Florida vaccinating obese people, qualify. Car accidents account 37k deaths year America, 173k lives (See NHTSA: we've 13x deaths (skewed way towards older population) COVID car crashes year roughly. 

I claim wrong mental / economic toll, yes, we've huge burden (with many people cannot work remotely taking brunt economic impact), like balance. Like hospitals capacity issues highest peaks, probably one chief concerns cause mortality rate peak. 

In terms ban alcohol, soda, etc, I'd say that's false equivalence. things primarily hurt (you argue DUI, also make illegal), pandemic mask wearing affecting people. That's mostly understand, ban mask wearing even want open up. 

We're sick tired pandemic (and yes goal posts constantly moving realize can't contain well thought due w/e reasons), actually end sight vaccines. Like get eligible adult vaccinated end May, fantastic! Maybe right consider opening earlier that, like even scratched 1/4 population yet we're ramping like crazy, I'd hope could least target vaccination % open phases kind thing? desperate times? could used AstraZeneca's till phase 3 covaxin progress. Serum institute sitting multiple doses. hurry approve vaccine even completed interim phase 3 matter change interim data

You administer vaccine without knowing efficacy hoping it'd effective. efficacy subpar reciever gets false sense security hoping get covid. understand civilized countries approve vaccines/drugs unless phase 3 data released? thanks president trump get people tired restrictions masks. get anyone thinks things truly ""get back normal"" state still clocking 7000+ cases/day \~12% positivity rate. Seems like waiting things actually get better (and better absolute peak \~1.5 months ago) responsible thing do.

End stupid things like outdoor dining capacity restrictions sports allowed etc., saying ""fuck it"" big 'ole mask burning party fucking stupid. what's joke? I'm american curious this. hang cowboys outbreak  expected, ‚Äúscariants‚Äù not, humoral immunity lasting vast majority people vaccination natural infection.

You won‚Äôt see media widely reporting however reduces fear, induces it. soon started talking ""double masking"" late game, knew would push lot people edge. Great analysis, like explained study way did. Okay. curious sounds like similar symptoms several months last year resolved treatment anxiety. comment earlier /s then?  may surprise large companies good innovation. nature pharma/med device industry highly regulated new stuff takes forever. Changing anything disrupts big cash cow commercial products. So, one ever wants new stuff big companies.

What big companies good supply chain scale lots money, someone comes somethinf new, simply buy scale up. Look many companies JnJ acquired lifetime. Merck's blockbuster drug keytruda also acquired. head state worked hard get virus circulating supposedly name ""herd immunity"", come variant seems deadlier, spread even faster, evade previous immunity. Bolsonaro accomplished feat without mostly enthusiastic help significant part populace.  guys getting groceries? I've using contactless curbside pickup for.... Well entire year now. Send Saint Louis far usage words, one apologize English first language, far I'm aware adjective refers development people groups/things overtime.

Taking page straight Trump script. another great vaccine third world. Same! remember china_flu like 1500 people every top comment ‚Äúhere go!‚Äù God, wanted smack people. bought like two months supply groceries, toilet paper bunch Lysol January last year. naive. biological warfare. Geographers using techniques making argument long Christakis. like southern US South America see point people want classroom. teacher friends say similar, want students personal families safe. 

They want make sure people don‚Äôt accidentally contract Covid bring back home (because currently limited vaccine distribution). also worried support safety protocols? Would schools enforce kind discipline students aren‚Äôt purposely wearing masks. There‚Äôs also concerns there‚Äôs big push go back science says it‚Äôs safe...but people making push ignoring science says safe need things like good hvac/ventilation smaller class sizes. things can‚Äôt realistically done drop hat.

School year almost done schools, say use time away make sure staff gets vaccinated improve ventilation plans adjusted class sizes. Moderna's production targets also small.  Well, spreads faster Covid 1.0, kills younger people 25%\~61% chance reinfecting someone already Covid before.

We scared death here. least part population, 30% unmasked zealous supporters president bring Brazil brink destruction alongside him. 11 states never mask mandates:

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  able get vaccine 85 y/o FIL Rutherford. Maybe different counties.  let go becauae covid 19? states allow companies fire worker received PPP money I‚Äôve proponent age-based approach along, also believe point relative risks similar enough would best open flood gates. 

Especially since younger people primarily responsible spread. 

It seems make sense vaccinate age groups order, starting oldest, age 50,

Then that, open everyone.

While may completely ‚Äúoptimal‚Äù according risks, gain efficiencies come restrictions, also protect ages primarily responsible spread. Thank you. sounded like one two loons thankfully. like 85%+ see were? Yesterday saw articles saying wasn‚Äôt approved. Plenty people die flu every year, really transmit asymptomatically. Imagine everyone might flu wore mask--oh wait, we're now, flu cases *way* down. 
 People get hope we're past it, gets worse 

People already thinking so! based numbers Texas already announced

Exactly! Declining numbers cause rush reopening either way. That's mostly unavoidable. that's argument fastest possible vaccination largest possible number people! 

In fact, faster (single dose) vaccination rollout, might easier hold opening back bit. even given two weeks needed injection work

That indeed problem independent single-dose/2-dose question...

PS. something else: turns need 3rd dose soon deal variants, lot people might get hesitant... got mine yet mum early 50s really sore arm first dose pfizer day fine that. work colleague 40s side effects. I've heard know pretty much experienced really sore arm day. Although friends mother abit headache abit tired hours felt fine next day.

Honestly think fine fir backpacking trip. She'll probably sore arm day even side effects we're day. feel perfectly fine Saturday worst case scenario. No, I‚Äôm talking human immunity. doesn‚Äôt anything variants - another issue.
Anyway data shows people continue gain immunity even without second dose. much numbers yet today saw big increases since yesterday north carolina alabama. Pennsylvania little less. Yeah Bolsonaro guy kept flaunting quarantine engage homosexual activities literally million men. Feel bad Texans. government ignored expert advice weather-proof energy infrastructure causing people die, weeks later thing regarding COVID measures despite dealing horrific performance nearly measures. expecting additional 120m combined Modern Pfizer additional 18m J&amp;J?

Am reading post correctly? choice yet, anyone priority group 1 get appointment right now. I'd take AZ shot tomorrow, chance I'd guess millions germans would same. government needs open AZ willing priority groups, could happen. political decision related health expert advice.

 Really? Texas Department Health board this? never gotten bad

Jokes aside, right  think they're saying potentially 92% two weeks first developing country, wealthy, many many areas desperately impoverished people. 

Do let disease run rampant ghettos? Increasing chance variant becoming even worse even people dying? 

Or approve vax looks promising full trials complete? 

Its easy question answer. stop pretending is. one establishment's policy really national news? one state state, one county. mandate, maybe 50/50, depending were. After, almost 100%, leave county, especially surrounding rural areas, I'd say maybe 1 4 people wearing mask, lucky. Meanwhile Abbott explicitly barred local mask mandates Texas. Fucker. feel flu vaccine brings flu range acceptable risk. 

Comparing masks seat belts apples oranges thing. seatbelt, example, cover young child's face hinder social emotional development. assume hypothetical flu mask mandate would come additional measures social distancing, closures certain businesses bringing tents school band play in. can't every winter. 

Interestingly enough, shocked learned flu vaccine really save many lives. flu vaccine important, saves millions lives every year (it doesn't), prevents many medical visits. reduction strain health care system makes flu vaccine valuable. 

In words, get flu vaccine thinking I'm saving lives. get get paranoid illness go bother doctor it. 

On personal note, expect able confidently fight flu couple decades starts getting punches in. feel flu take out, would probably time go, good flu vaccine corner affords little playing time. source working grocery store whole pandemic.  thought mayor Mississippi?  COVID came play, always least one cop local theater. that's town population less 14 thousand. Alamo Drafthouse locations tend much bigger cities, can't see cops present them.

Plus, ADH infamous putting fuckery, texting, talking, causing sort disturbance. Employees quick bounce people moment presents itself. I'd imagine would welcome chance make these, ""My riiiiiiights!"" ree rees exit stage left. manage freezing storm.

Yeah, present offering sky gods ensure Texas' safety? complete failure management! seems like gripe specific employee reported police battery, complaint whole company.

Plus, natural immunity ‚â† vaccine-acquired immunity. lie lie, regardless intent. else lying good? pretty interesting. lot people getting reinfected whole time show symptoms disease?

I can't imagine somebody COVID confirmed would suddenly decide go get randomly tested point months later. would pretty easy show data. 

This would also really good news long term ""immunity"" - is, severe disease, vaccinated infected people. Austria open summer, including large meetings hotels, masks always required etc. ok overall. (More open Germany)

Until November 2020 Germany deaths previous years included 25,000 heatwave deaths. Nov harder lockdown spring Germany opened early countries. I've already informed inputs directly affect outputs, climate, vary greatly. important informed things like many others are, one accurately assess overall performance. Seems lot deadly me, given fact 10-40x people died covid past 12 months flu average year. flu also seem produce debilitating long-term side effects not-insignificant portion get it. yes, asymptomatic spread rare, \*PRE-\*symptomatic spread significant driver pandemic, two functionally same, ie. could idea.

I think weird point past 12 months, numbers Texas would signal ""yep, time open everything up"", matter getting people vaccinated, everyone's got cock knot put mask walk grocery store. thought Pope Benedict liberal know say them.  forget N501Y. also present UK Brazilian variants.

18+| 20.3%| 10.2%
Total Population| 15.6%| 7.9% Maybe misreading tone, sound excited idea people dying prove right?

Too bad Texas like Florida, open nothing bad happen. Motherfucking Texas that's assuming virus vaccinating stays stable, no? keep getting new variants efficient Covid Classic, unclear one shot would protect them.  Congrats. I've got real phobia needles kind scared get called vaccine. Although I've always found hurts start thinking it. im relaxed even notice needle thing I‚Äôm ‚Äúhesitant‚Äù vaccine take. enough JJ supply people want it, maybe Pfizer/Moderna (the ones I‚Äôll take) easier get sooner too. 

Good news around! well state, talking Texas Longer generally better immune systems‚Äô response means less useful cells die time. 
That‚Äôs generally one year gap left vaccination boosters. Earlier vaccination boosts less useful components well desirable ones. LA County I'm likely move next Tier next week. 

I still ain't going without mask anywhere many people I'm vaccinated lol everyone subreddit told media pushes fear clicks ignoring good news? saying there's correlation high humidity states low corona outcomes? data supports that.

Calling ""fact"" is....yea, let's done here. Honestly, time start see effects lifting restrictions enough vaccines adults US. people die unnecessarily (when would easy keep mask mandate place another 8 weeks so) they‚Äôll play like right thing. me, saddest part puts essential workers risk need be. They‚Äôre behind vaccinations, means many people unprotected suffer unnecessarily. It‚Äôs heartless unnecessary imo. comes Fauci, he's scientist. There's reason scientists normally talk directly public. can't 100 percent confidently say something going happen, he's going say it. mean 99 percent, mean 100.

You see negatively he's viewed many people? imagine wrong *the way around.* promising delivering. People would getting pitchforks. One employees assaulted children brought bag snickers candy. take bullshit attitude far - understand needing enforce policies think putting hands kid neccessary. fairly traumatic made worse without talking us first disturb others.

I like Alamos trailer footage movies, otherwide they're still similar local AMC employees feel free put hands customers they're bad day. hate eligible Maine realized plan feasible done age brackets. leads believe us get vaccinated all. Remember students, kill graduating hell awaits you. help apparently high fines vaccine queue jumpers . even know that's really thing would probably keep people even trying get vaccinated .  Good you! Plainly envious. I've read immunity kicks 14 days first shot Moderna. small percentage immunity builds 14 days? Globe Mail identifying sources, familiar NACI deliberations, authorized speak publicly matter.

So running story leaked people authorized speak public. Yeah, seems like source believed versus. honest think feds hold back doses air traffic control part critical interstate infrastructure justification. Like said air control deliveries vaccines. Chicago isn‚Äôt complying mandate, rest state is. Chicago still essential workers 65+ Based data? every outcome metric listed above, ""poorly"" vaccine distribution ""average""

Which metrics show differently?

Again, data using? accused using feelings, call this? fair - currently they‚Äôre European citizens travel within Europe (Schengen area). 

Not saying disagree vaccine passport, I‚Äôm it! American living Europe I‚Äôm one friends feels way. Many Europeans know see potentially permanent restriction movement supposed area free movement, feel like rights stripped.

Again, personally support vaccine passport don‚Äôt see better way move forward, also sort understand complaints coming from. live South mask mandate entire time, everyone still wears mask.... ones far easily avoidable. Also, difference better results without mask mandate one. think countries lot people like visit typically poorer reason like visit dollar stretches lot farther yes total global travel rate take longer time recover. hope major mutation develop vaccine need super refrigerated. difficulties even US reaching rural areas vaccine needs kept cold hospital facilities within 100+ miles communities let alone facilities keep vaccines temperatures low need kept at. extrapolate places like beaches Mexico, Sahara Africa, exotic remote locations get see problem.

I work get deal issues like much smaller scale (how get data workforce remote locations securely) sometimes challenge, physical goods need refrigerated whole nother level complexity. Yep funny that, millions administered UK peep. read article 33% health care staff France take days work AZ vaccine ""side effects"". people know taken AZ sore arm feeling bit rough day, people UK made sterner stuff mainland? country from?

Also, agree people would prefer pfizer-biontech, vaccines already really good. Maybe International community including saying ""Biden good""  hey it‚Äôs start Proud American first time while. vaccine game point. B-but uncle Terry post facebook gay think covid hurt children.

Is science gay something?

I gotta know cuz I'm totally gay bro

Anyways, wanna wrestle? 96% efficiency ""old"" strains around 86% efficiency UK variant. right mRNA vaccines. Thanks info! conclusion author reached lockdowns ‚Äúwe‚Äù large instituted (may) led accelerated emergence virulent, transmissible, undetectable variants.

If want go road, implementing Covid restrictions save lives similar implementing lockdowns stop car accidents (which cause around 40,000 deaths per year). 

Regardless, bothered Oklahoma half death rate New York? flies face narrative? state zero restrictions half deaths state restricted everything. Oklahoma tens thousands people football games fall, better winter New York.

I really doubt everyone burned masks Texas yesterday. wore correctly time going still likely wear (if vaccinated). wearing them, half assing it, going throw out.  Sure going in-betweens wore state said too, vaccinated wore them, anyone actually enforcing laws anyways?

I think % people vaccinated wore mask yesterday wont wear today going pretty low. impressive accomplishment, sure! Intranasal ROA one candidate required refrigeration another. Best luck Cuban team doubt working asses pandemic.

The low death rate COVID due excellent contract tracing easy access healthcare also impressive accomplishment, shows healthcare outcomes always best improved throwing shitload money problem -- sometimes way use it.

It sucks countries think nothing learn Cuba disagree politically. Children adults ""having hard time"" expect? pandemic! Spanish Flu cake walk either people survived (with internet) children.

Bitchin wave, bro! point hand approve vaccine ohase 3 data hand. proves work excuse fact approved without phase 3 data. That's science works. Otherwise US Europe etc could approved pfizer back summer phase 3 data hope safe effective American mindset different countries.

In places people wear masks since government said to. Without mask mandates would. Like Sweden. since people trust health officials go ""Okay that's fair."" There's morons people prefer rock boat there's sense collective responsibility Patriotism.

Americans lack sort collective responsibility ""me me"". think America personal playground everyone around servants. selfish culture society. Fair, even conservative estimates put giving first doses everyone May. That‚Äôs attainable. That‚Äôs concrete. aren‚Äôt apparitions pipe dreams. good reason knock it‚Äôs done it. It‚Äôs extremely probable that, finish now?   call cops someone removed premises. 

If ask someone leave premises reason patron refuses leave call cops get property. Nothing illegal needs happening. That‚Äôs right give business. I‚Äôm saying they‚Äôre kind place doesn‚Äôt care losing business shitty customers. 

Your individual risk low still much carrier. Guidelines saying still masking. everyone fortunate vaccinated well.

What reason wear mask except political views? 85% vaccines distributed used. systems come online, percentage probably increase. doubled supply, would see large upscale distribution well. This. prominent figure said that, would immediately rise credibility me. politician said that, expect he'd vote rest career, I'd enthused follow plan I'd know could take words face value. BMI 30.1. get appointment give Pfizer simple 'losing weight'.  recent videos daily life Brazil. people dead now?  story ""only 750 people died removed mask mandate"" that's ""explosion"" cases fatalities - 750 unnecessary deaths! 

Also, Florida counties able mask mandates; state state level. Plenty Florida counties lots mask requirements. it‚Äôs still hovering around point late October. Yeah dude sucks. I'm going vaccinations overtake fucking morons thread removed. Please remember interact users respectfully. Thank you. *They* make political. anti-mask morons did. decisions affect though.

Go different theater. Novovax Ceo gave interview Cnbc yesterday. targeting approvals different countries. UK next month. US towards summer unless FDA accepts international data. I'd inclined agree going affecting others utilizing public resources ventilators, ambulances, etc. mention highly contagious virus lot people option go store, pharmacies, etc.. disregard safety could inadvertently harm someone grocery aisle public transit. 

They would directly impacting around choose take seriously.   Good points. Good choice using NC example, that‚Äôs haha What's crazy 2/16 Dr. Fauci said vaccines open general public early June. Now, considering enough doses every American end May, date must significantly sooner. could wrong?  brother Miami (against better judgement) returned talking nightclubs filled people without masks. pure Darwin there. DeSantis criminal. let go, using pass card swipe home office. touching imaginary spot wall scanner be. Happy cake day! You‚Äôre present vaccine! Enjoy day.  overthinking this. Practically doses get used someone regardless particular schedule appointment. whatever convenient long law permits it, let pharmacies government work many doses need supplied location keep demand. culturally encourage mask wearing flu season especially people feeling crappy. someone feeling unwell, still decent enough go work definitely mask protect others. I'm worried places going start banning mask wearing again, due ""safety reasons"" (as in, people concealing identity).  I'm used wearing masks even mostly behind us, still think want wear one crowded situations, like public transit -- like many people Asia. [This suggests 1400 (not 2000, wrong that) individuals aged 65+ studies considered initial approval.

That‚Äôs kicker Abbott lifting mandate. businesses opt keep asking mask wearing actual backing.

It‚Äôs going play exactly like said already happening way early cities counties putting mandates place Abbott kept saying weren‚Äôt allowed to. People stores acting like toddlers worst tantrum lives.

A lot businesses around South Texas already conceded fight don‚Äôt want employees situation. They‚Äôre announcing far business concerned, staff continue wear masks safety recommend customers well enforcing customers. agree you, worth noting media sources reported woman feeling bad right hours vaccination, turned worse following days. fully agree correlational/causal link investigated, although sickness hours seems suspect. know doubting accidents vaccines may happen 1 million less basis Fellow Masshole here, Baker announced state allowing teacher vaccinations starting 11th sites.  little version trump/Fauci friction going here.

Of course still people don‚Äôt get it, idiots refusing vaccinate kids measles shit. Indiana, least. still available 55+, healthcare, people one short list medical conditions. wife got second shot can't wait go movies again.  people get vaccinated, things start improve pretty quickly. Ummm, thanks dawg. Nope, Texas Executive order ban localities imposing mask mandates. Correct. overall efficacy strains. important thing 100% effective deaths hospitalizations. 

It's really possible compare vaccines differences trials. saying bottom line get whichever vaccine can, soon can. 

It really looks like J&amp;J vaccine going game-changer. single dose lack need extreme cold storage huge. allow us vaccinate rural transient populations much easier. make everything political? I've already vaccinated, theres one place town requires mask, I'm going there. Surprised recommended masking avoid pesky spring allergies!! I‚Äôve limiting news intake mental health reasons questions. 

How close Norvavex completely Phase 3?

Do see AZ getting US approval point? not? approved vaccine good vaccine.  It‚Äôs still impossible people get appointment, even elderly 1A groups. It‚Äôs cluster part. That‚Äôs including CVS, Rite Aid, shop rite. NY shifted javits center another one 24/7 hopefully helps it‚Äôs real tough find appointment need it, never mind list opened 

Doses ready may don‚Äôt faith distribution though, told 2 weeks initial March mayhem?

That initial reason justify lockdown.

""Close everything stay home 2 weeks flatten curve"".

It seems like official plan beyond flattening curve went indefinitely lot people felt cheated. Fucking hell that‚Äôs depressing Yep, kinda like [the CPAC guy needing explain crowd wear masks they're private property private property rules allowing also doses produced people eligible receive new phase coming state's plans'  *push again* 

why she‚Äôs enough Yeah emergency use needs phase 3 trial data.  believe you‚Äôre overthinking this. don‚Äôt think vaccination sites access multiple vaccines. get get. People make appts wherever get vaccine. They‚Äôre choosing vaccine. Adding eligibility criteria making appointment make things complex slow things down. open-carry crowd shows 'exercise rights'. Tiberius huge failure. nice idea, build upon systems already place? I'm Public Health military takes years roll programs. know previous administration thought could:

* develop competent system
* deliver states and
* train state personnel said system within given timeline

Building upon systems already place would required less effort around reduced lot confusion. Except UK data shows AZ vaccine effective Pfizer preventing hospitalisations 1 dose. case Germans driving German car Asian one, German car Volkswagen Golf turned Lexus SUV. Let's look worst case scenarios.

Scenario 1. get vaccinated. Worst case scenario. couple crappy days immune system goes full gear. 

Scenario 2. get vaccinated. things open back up, get infected. risk of, potential hospitalization, long term lung damage, losing sense smell, long term flu symptoms even death. Additionally, around 5% chance infecting relatives vaccinated. may young healthy could unintentionally put one hospital even kill them. 

Which scenarios comfortable with? Possibly uncomfortable couple days? potentially putting loved ones danger? Nah. Pfizer still 50-60% 2 weeks one shot. believe Pfizer 1-2 weeks 2nd shot, moderna 2-3 take full effect. one shot Pfizer 2-3 weeks much difference J&amp;J, deemed successful vaccine? 

In Ohio, started first week Feb teachers. districts still home dragged back kicking screaming even hybrid schedule March, vaccinating 100% staff. One reasons sited getting buildings ready. WTF? months plan this. Meanwhile suburban public schools hybrid year, rural districts hybrid full class, full class private charter schools. It‚Äôs BS. reason urban school districts Ohio grudging made plans go back (they keep moving date back) finally figured governor serious. Mind you, NONE concerns brought *after* staff received first dose vaccine. said problem going back two months prior. go stores enforce mandates. Live bubble. force idealogy mandates restrictions different level risk tolerance.

As 5 inch cloth - evidence shown makes almost difference. Watch video. Two notes: 

First, cold air blowing past mask contain COVID stated video. 

Second, guys pro-mask though 1st time saw sure demonstrating masks really work.

so reviewing video honestly tell masks people really effective stopping spread COVID? Well, agree masking would beneficial people would smart ""high risk"" activities.

But think bigger thing talking PAID SICK LEAVE.

Until sick people stay home without fearing they'll lose paycheck (and/or job), going people going work sick. that's going continue perpetuate spread flu (among things). Define effectiveness, keeping people hospital far AZ vaccine better UK, longer gap jabs increased efficacy similar levels. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

Like what? Fever...? Makes sense since South Africa hasn‚Äôt reported unusual number reinfections. slow rollout things ramped significantly. Happy good state national leadership long last. Feel bad Texans right now, though. Unprepared cold weather, ICU capacity bad shape, positivity rate climbing one worst vaccine rollouts country.

Seriously, who's running show there? pretty impressive symptomatic figures--especially considering J&amp;J vaccine facing UK variant. can't wait see symptomatic figures younger groups robust immune systems. Yeah except single-digit percentages fully vaccinated Americans categorically soon remove mask mandate. Well, read article, see virus going away. endemic, develop vaccinations variants emerge, learn live it. large/concerning outbreaks new variant (like bad flu season) might even see people wear masks go less.

Has proven 70%+ Manaus antibodies? Czechia, *the* Czechia. TL;DR: Germans don‚Äôt want take AstraZeneca because:
- side effects Pfizer one
- apparently 60-90% effectiveness compared 95% Pfizer one
- government approved people 65
- reasons Germans want drive Porsche instead ""cheap Asian car"" (""why take cheap one could good, expensive one"")

Result: lots vaccines don‚Äôt get used. 6% vaccinated even though would vaccine available Texas: Fuck that, REOPEN NOW. Iv thinking myself. end day, J&amp;J goto people want J&amp;J.

I thought people might want take ""not good"" lots people actually want pfizer/moderna.

1. 1 shot (americans really fuckin lazy. cant get time work 2 shots, cant get transportation 2 shots.)

2. trusted name brand. lady said waiting one knows J&amp;J, raised kids using products. wanted this.

3. trusted source vaccine type. mRNA new people dont like that. want know. live Missouri. 40% residents polled say refuse vaccine. title doesn‚Äôt imply shouldn‚Äôt criticized it. says criticized. I‚Äôm fan Alamo Drafthouse seems like exactly kind place wouldn‚Äôt give shit losing kind business coming adult incapable putting mask political perspective efficacy masks. Normal going back behaving like would bad flu season. Individuals decide willing take risk going crowded places, want isolate themselves. one stopping wearing mask better yet respirator actually something protect yourself. government's place make decisions us. included two link one links used webmd link allowed. someone without symptoms spread virus would literally walk right someone cough spit them.

That's demonstrably true. Droplets come breathing talking coughing sneezing. spreading incorrect information. STOP! 

You idea talking about, keep posting false information. fast holy shit. you‚Äôre gonna wear mask, least make useful stay home volunteer hospitals Yes study actually created overlapping peptides OG variant COVID measured cell reactivity convalescent plasma OG COVID. found little difference.

What study didn‚Äôt address whether relevant synthetic peptides made would actually presented MHC II variant infection. mutations affect peptide processing presentation, study results meaningful. said highly unlikely. Again, data present can‚Äôt really tell past antidote severe is. 

True, although know it‚Äôs likely contagious folks apparently reinfected Brazil variant. number ~~tropical places~~ poor places want bunch entitled Westerners overwhelming already tightened health system passing illnesses around country illnesses high fatality rates.

If EU citizen perfectly welcome opposed want people vaccinated coming country. not, respect foreign countries' sovereignty protect citizens virus deeply affected Europe anything century. #NOOOO! MUH WORRYING SIGNS!!! viral design submission mean? reported official news Yep. 100% effective hospitalizations liked one. easiest one. Way better vaccine, often alternative. Huge reduction hospitalization/deaths. Strong prevention transmission. vaccines, least US, approved emergency use I'll keep wearing mine.

Because I'm smart. think say lockdown get level semantics. mean lockdown? think UK much lockdown kind author finds could allowing deadly variants develop. view restrictions US (say NC reduce resturants bars access curfew) complete lockdowns. Certainly state like NC restrictions say complete lockdown. would guess author would view NC preferred method restrictions still allows transmission virus among younger health population. would also guess author supports GBD protecting vulnerable populations letting everyone else go day extent. mayor enact city ordinance? Saying publicly restrictions place enforcing locations entirely separate things. One helps public perception, ensures bring back business.

I‚Äôm betting you‚Äôll see something like private mask-less screenings something sort.
Cinemas going leave money table last year. Fixed, sorry  certainly sucks, especially since college amazing time many people. Calling best years life feels bad though. little like calling high school best years life. Yeah, fun lot good friends memories, most, best still lie ahead. alma mater made decision kids campus early August...right first tuition payments due. least there's still people Texas enough sense decency.  Australia essentially free riding ability 2000 miles away anyone

Under suggestion author, even virulent strain spreading places then? selective pressures even greater? No, none authors argument valid need explored. Israel's 85% symptomatic infection 15-28 days first dose.  well n=43 patients COVID cases based efficacy numbers on, 95% credible range must super wide. one extra person COVID Vaxxed group increase, efficacy change 2%. Remember Florida opened months ago everyone said thing? failed materialize despite older population, age one biggest risk factors. Remember New York done much worse despite maintaining strict measures? either denying reality believe Desantis swamp hiding thousands bodies. Can't eat/drink mask I'm really sure actually means. know, think making implication. Super jealous! Good though! :) nope. following medical experts. Trying kill population 2022 elections winter storm fact still don‚Äôt enough tests vaccines sad. means can‚Äôt open according Merkel Aren‚Äôt flu numbers historically low right now, common denominator masks?  Novavax efficacy 89%. Within 9 weeks huge swath Americans vaccinated least first dose. Mask wearing virtually economic impact unless people decided dig heels something protest wear mask. much that‚Äôs going change vaccine wise next 2 months respect character thankful see us safely across finish line safely possible awesome summer complain masks shrug 2,000 American deaths day. 

In circle people posting sentimental ‚Äúnever forget‚Äù pics 9/11.  Sure, would support plastic dividers long term health safety clerks. stand six feet apart line may long term feasible stores smaller square footage, stores high density neighborhoods, both. 

Now means ""socially unacceptable hug anyone live with"" no, let's future flu seasons. Honestly, feel like somewhat fault businesses themselves. Many spent decades letting employees abused irate, entitled asshole customers better business let people continue patronage. everyone surprised assholes came full force. Good hear. Good them. appreciated joke  like new easy buzzword scare people with. know are, lead news stories often ""SCHOOL CLOSED SUSPECTED CASE VARIANT!"" without even bothering mention *which* variant. media cause much stress anxiety literally benefit profitability. Take camping trip across country dad couldn‚Äôt ever complete. passed away January, going camp 1 night state summer. also lasted weeks, year+ Article 3 months old. arm sore headache next day. Perfectly fine that. social pressure half wrong half right, whatever preference carrier. solid data one way other, thus err side caution. Vaccine makers saying data isn‚Äôt available. 

If won‚Äôt sway you, possibly small percentage still get sick post vaccine. Protect others.

You talking state cdc? cdc guidelines saying stay masked continue social distancing even post vaccination. numbers efficacy mild symptoms. still don‚Äôt understand fully numbers work, I‚Äôve seen lot vaccines multiple numbers.

At least vaccines 100% efficacy preventing death right? difference efficient stopping mild/severe symptoms? aren‚Äôt many movies coming either also secured eight million doses Novavax‚Äôs vaccine part EU joint purchases. vaccine yet approved EU regulators.

Looks like EMA causing hold-up here. TBF one else approved Novavax yet. previous vaccines anything go though they'll slower US UK approving it. That's called wife college. wear mask continue to, don't, also continue to. organization based England recent history sexual abuse financial scandals. sure CBS News would give story much prominence. Fair point. suspect many antimaskers don‚Äôt care pandemic not. Also suspect covid going around good yet. Yeah many variables play need investigated draw sort actionable conclusion.  Show even tiniest amount skepticism frustration restrictions army strawmen come out. JB handled well. clear phases trigger changes relaxations. Texas reacted whenever governor feels politically expedient. It‚Äôs problem anymore  I'm California they've opened anyone high risk health conditions even do, small list specific qualifying conditions.

Every single state &amp; county country operating completely different guidelines. Comment another thread - Germans would rather drive Porsche (Pfizer) cheap ‚ÄúAsian car‚Äù (AstraZeneca others etc.) terms effectiveness ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I‚Äôm happy things open 100%, mask mandates removal isn‚Äôt gonna change huge amount. I‚Äôm glad masks personal choice now, one before. people weren‚Äôt wearing masks aren‚Äôt going change, people gonna keep it‚Äôs socially acceptable to, come decently soon Texas. empty hospitals lacks deaths ignored ""well know long term effects, Zero COVID still goal"" nonsense. hope vaccine manufacturing capacity continue expanding across world. Hopefully, every year, we'll able vaccinate faster newly adapted vaccines, make virus mutates slower lower transmission. So, big game wack-a-mole, every round reflexes bit faster moles, bit slower. finally win game. 

I sure hope that's gonna happen, cause that, see we'll get long run. get mask mandates, depressing world would permanent curfews, social distancing isolation. know humans high capacity adaptation, decade pure isolation, schools permanently closed, infinite lockdown rigorous sexual abstinence anyone outside household seems like never-seen challenge in. Honestly, feels like Black Mirror episode. Would happiness even possible circumstances? bet huge shift people working home going affect flu numbers good way. Also, idea wearing mask youre sick, going around sick person, big stigma anymore. probably seen critics later banned. day whine democracy gutters mods can't explain exact rule violated part comment offensive.

It precisely sub looks like is. Anti-India day long. Yes. report work year. manager showed cough, sniffling. felt there, absolutely didn't. caught it, despite masked, passed family. inconvenient small kids, thankfully was.

I enjoy pissed him, entire work culture. irrelevant people commenting here, unfortunately. Everything second virus. Every. Thing.

Argue masks, that's people talking about. strawman ""everything second virus want control us!!!"" nonsense. We're talking masks mandates soon lift. nuanced conversation, conversation simplify bring unrelated points push agenda people taking precautions. 

This discussion mask mandates lifted right now. Something every public health official agrees time yet. something common sense dictates *clearly* time for. We're taking reopening businesses fully sending kids school, **also** nuanced conversations deserved looped ""you want masks schools closed hate freedom"" types pointless conversations. 15 days slow spread work Europe either lot harder lockdowns 90% US.

We ended right back place fall got laughed mocked us summer. Yep. flu, know pretty quick it. Symptoms wait week two show like covid. flu spreads adults can't miss work. Also, kids sick they're going keep home either can't stay home them. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

DOOMED!! üòÜ Interim news good. Let's wait data. vaccines coming in. don‚Äôt even understand percentages mean...Seems it‚Äôs 50%, worth having. understand risk transmission much lower vaccinated person. way. cattle clinics age everyone else needs medical reasons sooner medical facility doctor it. bad lot doctors access administer shots. Afaik Brazil already talks (or already bought idk) 20 mi doses vaccine, I‚Äôm quite happy result.  je skoda. I'm sorry, really sucks. I'm Texas, US, we're really screwed state government. wish leaders would put people's lives first. Haha...of course is. think sick cold flu, mask protect others.

Not everybody wears mask summer.

At least, thats hopefully masks normalized enough be.

It sucks meeting somebody sick hoping thats 3 days.

My boss came work last year flu 1/2 office sick within week. Jerk move thats easily preventable. 

He never apologized probably doesnt even connect mind got sick solely actions. I‚Äôm Michigan. see people Target without mask time.... Absolutely. JB handled well anyone could given makeup state. There's really valid argument contrary. Looking outcomes ignores inputs equation, demographics, commute style, population density, climate things.
Smart people recognize complicating factors see Texas well today, whereas Illinois working hard make slow rollout. think moral story corporate culture needs change ""win advance costs"" ""the human body delicate machine rest recover occasionally"".

Last February, weeks world changed, went office presentation could barely speak, coughing like crazy, lightheaded copious amounts caffeine kept upright. can't see ever happening again. Masks you‚Äôre sick could something like washing hands visited toilet. law, something maintain decent level hygiene. Tbf New Jersey teachers beat grocery workers too. Despite schools still even bring open. union runs government surprising part teachers didn‚Äôt get doctors did. guarantee poor employee guest going get hurt killed mandate repealed. happened across country. butthurt fanatics pulling knives getting guns car home coming back vendetta. sorry gullible believe that.  UofM appearances keep up. I‚Äôm amazed haven‚Äôt outright expelled students. also amazed don‚Äôt prescreen voting record require recognize 29 different genders admittance. It‚Äôs UofM.

$5000 haven‚Äôt even fucking Ann Arbor let alone know anything Umich. Foh Texas‚Äôs policy also preempts local rules, cities can‚Äôt enact mask mandates. right please. really news. Yeah saw that. Unfortunately openings city. keep trying Damn. know feels. shits going way long want end now. guess way see even every state pulled TX MS, virus isn‚Äôt gone, many people would still distance hesitant, many places wouldn‚Äôt open. 

This fall incredibly discouraged spiked. know every day really feeling like we‚Äôre one day closer end. day goes instead checking case numbers I‚Äôm checking vaccine rollout numbers. faster goes quicker virus falls face world. 

After year hell think forgot 0 (or close to) cases next months. truly bound happen. Every week passes one week closer *entirely* behind us. Vaccinated !!!!!!!! 

Spain, AstraZeneca, fast like 2 seconds noticed all, bit needle phobia bit anxious moment fast!! 

Go vaccines üí™üí™üí™ Ditto beautiful idea Yes, think number cited 76%.   I‚Äôm even sure ones accurate it‚Äôs winter. idea residence snowbirds are, think keep summer residence plates sure.  Long term effects highly correlated hospitalization Wow guys must proud... congrats, Houston! Depends ""social distancing"" means. Stay 6ft apart line plastic shields customer clerk? That's fine. Yeah saw that, rate expect parents get summer. reasons getting eligibility window (my mom supposed eligible next phase end March). dad would probably considered part general population time window eligibility. think unlike states approved smoking priority reason. get wrong glad dad getting shot find crazy grandma missed first window eligibility 3 years young getting dad. parents 52 57 far age range.

Also seems antivax problem within older population way bigger originally thought... Yeah right? Like would really rather leftover dose go trash someone who‚Äôs eligible? don‚Äôt know it‚Äôs something local Walgreens corporate policy Cases level July last year constant mutation threat every person vaccinated. know u can‚Äôt think level. Thank taking time correct bullshitters proper sources. Taste film political? Nobody said countries dumber. idea got from.... declared Chapter 11, meaning they‚Äôll restructure debt. aren‚Äôt going business. Yeah everyone getting fucked. expecting college students isolate longer year virus poses threat cruel opinion. Arguably? phase 3 seems reasonable. work, work, _safe_ thus worse nothing, whilst possibly giving India headstart vaccination. Masks perfectly acceptable global pandemic wear now. can't see difference Covid Flu, really know tell grew thinking taking unless sick unable work laziness. Zoomocracy  /s ? weird dynamic Abbott always trying Austin big cities annoying. get ‚Äúvaccine mean mask‚Äù sentiment, one second typing google search bar tells you‚Äôre selfish lazy People 30 39 3 times likely die people 18-29. People 40 49 8.6 times likely die people 18-29.  Thank reassurance. Statistically usually fall within norm. Never much outlier. Getting shot tomorrow morning. I‚Äôll update anyone curious. everyone opportunity it‚Äôs good. There‚Äôs gonna sad people thinking man gotten vaccine hooked ventilator never said bleach, UV light real. remember company made got kicked Twitter YouTube Trump's comments, even though posted anything recent. trial Cedar Sinai iirc. set massive FEMA tents local fairgrounds 3k people day south fl... working it. prob close 200 today. nah never did, even pandemic i'd see nothing outright denial regarding viruses, third world science race mixing boosting (\*collective\* presume) immune system, supposed stick used needles skin boost immune system whatever garbage.

the recent spike result carnival parties (they banned, can't stop hordes braindead individuals thing), carnival goers afraid getting even AIDS. morons assholes know still morons assholes well covid Yeah that‚Äôs good point. think mask wearing would still good idea? would love wear mask definitely would needed worries, reducing voter base Exactly. possible believe COVID real states need plan lift restrictions. compromise *today* everyone vaccinated (probably never) COVID eradicated (even less probable). States like Illinois California actually tenable exit strategy.  That‚Äôs total re-writing history. Fauci started saying two weeks.. month.. changed two months. Happy you, doesn‚Äôt mean city won‚Äôt continue handling vaccination program nearly criminal levels incompetence... I‚Äôm still betting June/July personally like china russian, problem guess take vacation Texas want. Don‚Äôt break mind logic Palm beach county pretty well. vaccinated well 200 people today.  GET MINE? üò≠üò≠ don‚Äôt want waste last 20s sitting home. I‚Äôll end thirty, flirty crying. Right. fun getting drunk crying mask concert! I'm pretty sure 74 million never understood begin forgot soon heard. even respiratory disease deaths matter you, literally covid deaths. Second roaring twenty‚Äôs coming in. Bars clubs restaurants going see volume like never come end this. summer going giant party fest fucking sneezing next someone like bless dog moving along alright let‚Äôs go mfer turn  Glad hear it. getting mine weeks, hopefully immune system won‚Äôt go overdrive. 

Also love flight sims PC would probably explode tried run MFS. Covid may going anywhere, certainly are. USA focking huge. Go vacation Alaska something summer No, 23rd 24th February, 6 million distributed day. Almost seven million 23rd. Make   ü¶ç üöÄ üåö LETS GO I‚Äôm sure back part enough people refuse vaccine doesn‚Äôt happen. think Ohio April. Wouldn‚Äôt surprise see Ohio/Indiana/Kentucky/wv announce together day. Although West Virginia‚Äôs numbers, could probably go now.  New Reddit? Fines racist classist abolished. know America works? last big thing last week. something week got focus on. Except say pandemic end soon RemindMe month ! I'd put fall USSR important, others. particularly relevant people world. I‚Äôm sure individual gatherings homes contributed much business regulations mask requirements gas stations. 

What else could explain NY‚Äôs numbers great moment, Florida ok? suppose still change really quickly here, Midwest states jump fully open rapid succession governor political pressure least open somewhat. today, current information past trends, see happening /that/ quickly. 

I think LA County burned first rapid reopening, became EXTREMELY paranoid going rate could remotely considered fast. Whether that's right wrong opinion on, point. mean, want hug mine, power you... Texan, say dumbest state union Yes, talked BSL-3 lab scientists early on. flooded, primary concern SARS-CoV-2 medical properties time. OCLC REALM project tried surfaces initiative, found cytotoxic materials, succeeded many get decent decay curve.

It's literature, could find one study real saliva decay experiments, scientists say saliva different lab matrix, especially infectious people. example, Italian study infectious virus saliva, showed ratio RNA/infectious virus varies much curse illness. maybe mucosal antibodies immune processes wreck havoc virus assembly, people infectious anymore immune response kicks in. Therefore, getting saliva test centers would crucial establish limits.

BTW, Austrian scientists found evidence minimum dose genetic statistical analysis really missing, efficiency factor aerosol large droplets. people Asthma heard fine aerosol goes long way distributing drugs lung tissue. suspect here. Perhaps scientists invent method test factor indirectly, can't think one right now, theoretical calculation.

Also, read German geneticists believed could determine infection chains high likelihood, can't find study right now.

But tracing, must identify highly discriminative environments, ask people contacted. environment found, extensive testing could done.
For example, many people infected, got enough cases sequentially shared high-ventilation rooms. Tracers ask things, e.g. operators sharing machine different shifts. Train engineers often see taking locomotive, example. high-ventilation gyms vs. low-ventilation gyms, mask mandates.  Correct, there‚Äôs recorded long term negative effects vaccines. one 100% safe comfort level anyone else's problem own. Gonna shit storm. Texas control group rest pandemic. Really sad, stupid. know cool people Houston rest Line Star. Best luck. every medical antibiotic I‚Äôve ever side effects. Every restriction does.


Antibiotics commonly side effects, trying make point experienced side effects would stop taking prematurely medical advice risk encouraging antibiotic resistant illnesses? Florida also oldest state union, highest average aged human. reasonable measure, restrictions Florida resulted catastrophic death case rates. However roughly California regards.

That said, California ""lockdowns"" primarily put low wage workers work everyone else fine. Again, main issue children harmed COVID themselves, spreading COVID high-risk adults like teacher grandparent. people vaccinated, excuse gone. cell line derived aborted child seems used development production Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine,"" Archdiocese said.¬† church said Catholics abstain getting vaccinated, stress Moderna Pfizer vaccines acceptable according tenets faith.¬† JFC :) hope rest country follows Texas' lead states surround need enforce checkpoints... dumbest move possible I'd argue *make* sociopathic...they always way. Yes, that‚Äôs true. think Americans access genuine self-protective masks, I‚Äôd feel differently mask mandates everywhere. could protect better, wouldn‚Äôt care much. sign happening anywhere whatsoever pulling ass? I‚Äôm ~~pilot~~ doctor. ~~fly~~ vaccinate. keep feeling reminded idea latchkey incontinence. know, phenomenon hold long time, somehow approach doorstep, need go feels almost unbearable? That's us. That's brains. see end sight care piss pants unlocking door. There's going long-tail people take get vaccinated. also lot people simply want vaccine. Polls indicate somewhere 50-80% range get vaccinated immediately. end May supply \~100% adults (400M mRNA doses=200M adults. \~80M J&amp;J doses = 80M adults. US \~260M adults). Even US administered 75% doses end May, could ""end"" vaccination campaign many purposes. Bars closed state, indoor dining later summer even 25%-50% capacity masks.

Personally think going eating dinner pandemic accepting risk comes vulnerable out.

Vaccines, working. /s saying mentioned millenials way making point, one really needs concern making coherent point. state union vaccinating millenials seniors. vaccination rate (completed two doses) 0f 7.3% puts state bottom decile performance, that's nothing brag about.  Concept: 30th bad, 38th worse? Reinfections happen, however think much potential reignite pandemic. Despite huge loads cases, yet plenty unexposed people everywhere. you‚Äôre vaccinated you‚Äôre safe Well, guess best place start find community. kind things like?

I'll say though, lot easier make happen live city rather rural area though.

Public messaging campaigns require level certainty table stakes new scientific endeavor reticent provide. That‚Äôs good know! We're dead last nation vaccines distributed. understand businesses masks? Besides politically pander, masks anything harm business. Literally 7 weeks everyone could've vaccinated. hell even end March almost every vulnerable could've vaccinated. could've least let cities put place mask mandates no... Take upvote.

""This news, lot downers Cali.""  UK dateline London... looks like JJ got support Lilly got hit Cialis hopefully erection lasts 4 hours. People always gonna die... vaccines stop death happening unfortunately. didn‚Äôt say corruption I? 
There might conflict interest though, US allows civil servants take paid roles private companies, imagine it‚Äôs far uncommon. know ‚Äúthe administration‚Äù million day   seen quote CNN changed tune trumps gone? even took death toll second Biden mean, take word (or internet stranger's word). Let's look data: 

[One estimate Columbia University puts cumulative number infections since pandemic began around 36% article month old, let's say additional 1% become infected since publish date. brings us 37%. 

[As 7 hours ago US administered 78 million vaccines covering 15.6% population daily average 1.9 million tack 15.6% vaccinated estimated number 37% infected (I know overlap two groups, probably minimal) get 52.6% population degree immunity covid. 

[Dr. Fauci &amp; epidemiologists estimating herd immunity covid happen 70-90% US population gets infected vaccinated, functionally end 

If US keeps 1.9 million daily vaccination number 28 days means 53.2 million shots. 42 days 79.8 million shots, double number shots already administered. 

That means extra 15-16% population would vaccinated come mid-April, bringing us close 70% needed possible herd immunity.

It‚Äôs one thing force near inevitable infection high-exposure workers current variant, it‚Äôs another it‚Äôs twice deadly. Sunshine Patriot. Although countries nearly enough vaccine nobody age 55 access it, seeing vaccine getting priorised people 90, 95 getting low immune response (so vaccine less effective) also challenging. 
How many vaccinated died old age now?

Priority age works fine tell 50yo essential workers access, short enough time Who‚Äôs ‚Äúthe side‚Äù? seems directed people opening states getting rid mask mandates specifically. much real progress us due herd immunity? important question tough one quantify. Maybe 100 deaths/day? IIRC late spring/early summer 2020 US ~600 deaths/day surge later summer. course vaccine back then, maybe could ought set different bar full reopening? could get 600/day last summer w/o vaccines, 100/day summer considering plenty vaccines go around? pondering... abstain saying want, make less true.

If give good reason group fully vaccinated people interact I'd love hear it.  üòÇ Pat back little bit harder champ clear there's seasonality COVID. Comparing Florida colder states exactly apples-to-apples. They've lucky best. he's absolutely wrong. sure board want hear develop active healthy immune system requires exposed viruses. Cutting ability surely problematic road.   Governments work voters. public support restrictions government right forcing people comply. people want restrictions restrict themselves. got first Moderna shot! 22 y/o male Paramedic. Couldn‚Äôt help feel nervous chicken shit getting though lmao despite knowing information comfortable facts lmaoooo üëåüëå Brave 45 old German :)
As member vac group 2 got first AZ shot today. invited short notice yesterday late evening. Never thought going accept it. 
I feel priviliged happy got early. compared nations far ahead (some questionable methods). global scale, I‚Äòm still one really early group. 
Side effects? Nothing yet - hey, even feel bad days it‚Äòs still better Covid. 

Although many disasters around vaccines DE, communication AZ one worst. think failures lead politicians resigning. September, elections. hope disaster won‚Äòt bring far right far left high :( Cool, worry it. completely touch, I‚Äôm college one know enjoys online school. Yes people don‚Äôt like giant lecture halls, would like ability watch zoom. However every month forced online students told classroom helps focus understand what‚Äôs taught better. guidelines changing wind.  think flu 1918 caused lot damage... I‚Äôm told Lockdown works goal destroy economy civil liberties. keeping people safe marketing gimmick, sign marketing gimmicks. Masks really much people take private gatherings social distancing.

So there's much point mask mandate? ‚ÄúIn period time, community cases general population dropped 46 percent, showcasing vaccines impact protecting elderly population nursing homes.‚Äù 

The time frame nursing home drop discussed earlier America enigma Hey Joe, according 23andMe I‚Äôm 0.5% Neanderthal take offense that.  Virginia Dept. Health provides two sets information death. reports date date death reported actual date death. organizations use information see fit. 

I agree particularly helpful providing good information is. outbreak northeast much worse people realize. That's worst death tolls. states able prepare extent. Setup bare minimum guidelines, PPE supply channels hospitals, % mask usage. called novel virus reason, blindsided northeast. dude realize cant ring covid's manager like ""what date done."" Public health messaging consistently 6 weeks late entire pandemic. Well, they're looking replace em robots... keep fingers crossed! sane Texans suffering, I'd leaving Texas rot. every story read variants ends talking vaccine able handle all. Science telling us working it‚Äôs helping stop spread. see numbers. coal plant south dakota loses $170 million year. sale likely buyers. 

It transmission line. Wind farms want build around make use transmission line. Figuring transmission one difficult parts getting wind grown really great solution. Bye coal hello cheaper cleaner wind energy. win win.

The county located put moratorium new wind farms want save coal plant.

All say, crap decisions made everywhere people seem living fine. Proudly even. I‚Äôm sure people Texas walking around sans mask hurt president didn‚Äôt vote said them. articles bit ago started adjusting variants saying FDA wouldn‚Äôt require another whole trial anything like that, lot quicker. : it‚Äôs long ago feels, I‚Äôm probably wrong saying it‚Äôs started adjusting them, main point same. government lifting mandates mean people cannot voluntarily wear masks social distance appropriate circumstances. Mandates intended temporary emergency provision indended protect people bad choices.

I high risk kids home can't vaccinated, may year. take extra precautions, expect entire world stay emergency status specific situation. one thing dread returning office sit conference room surrounded 20 people also need there. Lol Yeah... June sounds right me. don‚Äôt think they‚Äôll relax EVERYTHING though states hesitant others.  Lol knew meant least. It‚Äôs possible virus could evolve evade cells, poster says - honesty wrong

That **NOT** said. said ‚Äújust easily‚Äù evading antibodies. posting comment went read even material I‚Äôve found nothing agrees that. seems like it‚Äôs significantly difficult evade cells seriously accusing corruption? Give break.  states havent decade winter storm directly prior reopening. award utterly ridiculous idea goes to... also less damage economy

Has research done comparing economic damage?  feeling worn enough... way outed myself. hyperboles don‚Äôt mean shit me, justify closure economies.  This. Exactly. say it, result fewer people taking shot. CDC behind updating numbers today. Wonder changing stuff show J&amp;J little differently. happy see us see really. I‚Äôm sure link Brexit. EU countries full sovereignty investing vaccine drug manufacturing. aren‚Äôt even obliged join EU-wide procurement vaccine purchases. Many countries gone way purchased vaccines outside EU bloc procurement process. Well shit  texas, start blasting away, self defense. make people swear telling truth. people lie get through, overall follow priorities.  actually. spread flu flu vaccine. sterilizing immunity. call individual pharmacies whatever see list. local pharmacy took name said since I'm next phase would call anyone list currently eligible me. Usually around 5-10 min, give intramuscular medications sometimes quicker drugs start work within 15 min. lie travels around globe truth putting shoes. try feed propaganda foreigners.

idiot go look history. nationalized everything party continues legacy... current gov privatizing everything... u authoritarian u give control... Yup. 10% everyone gets exposed, like crammed one building. everyone get exposed reality virus reaches many dead-ends now. fact never seemed bother labeled ""genocidal"" press, Brazilians started mock dick size instead.  understand business engage inform facts people Interstate commerce clause says that.  Obvious needs said. think people read much word concern think we‚Äôre page disagree philosophically. 

Given world today may wishful thinking believe media consumers make appropriate decisions given nuanced data points. gonna happen aka masks burning June. Plus many meekly butt sit every winter. Unfortunately happened dark first told misunderstood him. later home bring understand. point thought hope resolution except giving business anymore. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  definitely agree. know one person circle two positive tests many months apart, thankfully cases mild, still symptomatic able infect others. getting vaccinated they're eligible. Actually they‚Äôre sort right. cells recognise peptides, snippets viral (or other) protein, placed surface cell something called MHC (multihistocompatibility complex, posh name basically presentation plate. MHC constantly showing cells bits inside cells, cells (usually) know attack see normal cell proteins. cell infected virus MHC presents chunks viral protein cells get woken up. cell specific one particular peptide, words specific chain amino acids.


I imagine one nuance that‚Äôs getting missed billions/trillions different cells body, specific slightly different peptides. (They rearrange DNA first develop different - it‚Äôs amazing!) never even see peptide specific for! do, multiply.

It‚Äôs possible virus could evolve evade cells, poster says - honesty wrong. wouldn‚Äôt lose sleep it. cells antibodies part give us multiple prongs immune response protect us better. immune systems co-evolved viruses millions years (I remember told lecture dinosaurs MHC).

I‚Äôm mobile linking isn‚Äôt easiest here‚Äôs Wiki‚Äôs explanation epitope: TCR rearrangement it‚Äôs cool: reason they're approved there's reasonable doubt work... Yeah lol. Gotten like 40+ appointments family friends point. It‚Äôs become kind weird addiction/hobby point. Drop 45 agree. Exactly. Saying ""the second fully vaccinated, go back normal life"" recipe disaster. want things go back work much next guy, wait bit longer hospitalizations deaths fall. think clear sounded. comment relevant? Biden signing EO, directing resources away dumb states. He's simply stating opinion, something framed 1st Amendment. Maybe heard it. biggest rebuttal hydroxychloroquine ""miracle cure"" country around world would shown proven it. People fail realize probably think whole world revolves around United States. don‚Äôt support decision, wish leaders would give concrete timeframe would appropriate drop measures (and saying 70% herd doesn‚Äôt count). fact leader willing make leap governors putting decisions hands. I'm way closer ground jumped plane. I'd better cut loose parachute.  Yeah feel like college high school really high point someone's life something must gone wrong would mean large majority years pretty bleak. years education almost like training stage actually facing real challenges; hardly even seem relevant another 5-10 years. That‚Äôs lot speculation regarding think people want hear. that's pretty piss poor compare heavy lockdown state vs mostly wide open months state **[Crowd Heckling]** hated office chitchat burning passion. try re-office me, I'll looking new job. I've completely fallen love WFH Oh god teachers. Thank brave sacrifices Sweden probably never go full lockdown (constitution even allow stay home orders), article states country enforcing strictest restrictions yet. things get worse might even seeing non-essential shops services closed first time. immune response vaccination seems much stronger though, necessarily count prior COVID infection protect variants even vaccines  ü•∫ approval go variant vaccines? assume it‚Äôs quicker investigative drug trial? Seems pump new flu vaccines every year problem right Yeah, physics flight proven change variables identified scientific study. new virus, even related previous, static variables relied on. accurate comparison would flight different planet. physics similar different due change variables.

You're correct way science use known variables similar viruses starting point. Even must verified. Media qualified would complete assumption could disastrous consequences. Add 10 year age range every month (55-65 March, 45-55 April, etc.) also give doctors offices clinics underlying conditions.

It's rocket science. throwing out, putting people waitlist already qualify able get appointment yet. thing happened me, though still take name number, saying everyone actually met current phase would called me.  Fighting clickbait crappy journalism one thread time. Thank you! 1.02 million doses AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine, manufactured Serum Institute India  people excusing New York‚Äôs numbers compared Texas first shit United States compared Australia.

Also, year thing, don‚Äôt think density matters. South Dakota got crushed. Nothing New York open Texas. million variables. CDC take measured approach vaccination really kicks high gear next months. Telling fully vaccinated people take masks public go dance club night telling people still waiting turn keep masks stay home would quickly create ""haves"" ""have nots"" would devolve even chaos already today. 

I would anticipate messaging change vaccination rates get north 50% see deaths hospitalizations fall numbers would closely resemble seasonal flu. lived whole life, missouri seems serious follower culture. even ""show state"" nickname. We'll probably fall behind due people, half complete 180 demand vaccine Illinois Kansas report 80-90% adult vaccination rates, good chunk half get avoid conversation sister Thanksgiving Christmas. countries it.

Why US poor enforcing distancing?  haven‚Äôt seen mask mandates enforced subway (though 99% people follow them). includes vaccinated individuals naturally infected individuals. fair, people want vaccine probably followed social distancing masking guidelines, less likely first place gathering would relatively safe compared general population

Not disagree, wanted point sort self-fulfilling prophecy lol Yes. countries like US get 70% coverage, bigger focus send vaccines towards developing countries Africa, Latin America Asia avoid new variants. mean, teacher week kinda problem shortage substitute teachers. sure anywhere answer short going read study seeing touch lol Perfectly valid option free people. NJ honor based best approach imo Nope guys without researching?

The flu actually this! ability create variant-specific mRNA vaccines weeks dramatically strengthen defense covid19, already super exciting annual response flu (assuming returns normal levels). Sorry, allow surveys posts. California better Fucking savage I‚Äôm freshman covid think Im enjoying college lmao, even restrictions north Texas? :) think GP late April early May rate.  Getting mine next week health dept couple counties over. Can't wait!  Bro. I‚Äôve lived Japan Korea. 

Yes, people wear masks ill. Nobody Japan wearing mask go shopping. 

The comment responded mentioned wearing mask go shopping anytime. Context. BMI 25 cause NJ expanded health eligibility 29th well. this. confusing discouraging people need vaccinations. 

If absolutely want pander various interest groups professions, there's simple way it. 

* Open vaccine availability 5 year tranches (75+, 70-74, 65-69, 60-64...). baseline. 
* Identify set essential, high risk professions - meatpackers, medical workers, teachers, elderly caregivers. get skip **one** age bracket sign affidavit saying eligible that. 
* Identify set high risk conditions - obesity, hypertension, .... condition, sign affidavit confirming diagnosed one high risk conditions. get skip **one** age backet. 

So essential worker high risk condition, skip two age brackets. So, currently open 65+, 55+ teacher asthma get now. Or, confused, wait extra weeks 55+ opens naturally. 

Given age greatest predictor death, right balance recognizing fundamental risk context higher infection risk (essential workers) death risk (comorbidities).

I realize never happen, god, understand justify healthy 24 year old teachers obese asthmatic 26 year old getting vaccinated 64 year old. unconscionable me. I'm sorry. is, believe Yeah, backwards lockdown states per capita numbers non-lockdown states lets ignore facts. :) Good them. hope North Carolina follows suit  I‚Äôm Texas think logic clear. Apply scientific pursuit - flight, instance. 

The Wright Brother‚Äôs first plane doesn‚Äôt hold candle modern 777 airliner, basic principles lift, thrust drag apply. 

You don‚Äôt start every time innovate something. first principles apply. fabled Third Johnson  remember funny Asian people always wearing masks? Look countries handled pandemic best. look forward day soon walk Walmart CVS get shot üôÇ feels like end nightmare finally coming. think need read lines. Formal recommendations possibly tomorrow (that news). recommendations, nutshell, look like essentially going take mask around vaccinated people. think want hear vaccinated, go start living open, free life longing year now. point. Ironic doctor name  introvert pretty severe anxiety social pressure gather large crowds coming around corner. 63 year old man dies... 
Move on.   fact person confused shows exactly /s useful... It‚Äôs gonna hard tell obvious bunch get nothing Covid. good number likely immunity got recovered. Right everyone partied hard brought us 30‚Äôs... didn‚Äôt get either (and read book ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è) comments think it‚Äôs great gatsby thing. Same. indeed vaccines tend Hopefully around 90% os Vaccines SP state institute Butantan Coronavac despite difficulties made PR

Weird flex. Long covid affect kids? 11 month old lose sense smell? Death statistic disease causes people concern. 

Agreed locked nation shut deaths go vulnerable. need everyone working need businesses open mental health needs return normalcy.

Anyone hoping worst Texas really look themselves. 

You disagree Abbott‚Äôs decision hoping backfires prove point cruel. actually wanted Moderna morbid curiosity symptoms like. living Pfizer one beyond thankful that‚Äôs one got. compassion turn living life fear. Wearing mask huge burden. get sick young, probably won‚Äôt die. Yay. could easily spread someone will. It‚Äôa living fear care killing others. take weird me. Note: lost 53 year old healthy aunt this. I‚Äôm living fear wearing cloth. I‚Äôm trying kill someone else‚Äôs aunt. Same... reach 15% banned imposing fines penalties all. Heard worry Alabama variant; apparently stays family. Meanwhile Washington state reopen March 2022. he's restating we've already known week two. Texas: YOLO, YEETHAW! like weekly numbers lot more! know man; finish line come people stop following ad hoc, arbitrary rules make logical sense.

People like Fauci saying need social distance masks another year.  already first dose last Thursday! I‚Äôm excitedly way full vaccination. hope government approves general use.

Currently, one required sign consent form get vaccine. Hopefully soon get wear need masks angry stupid anti-maskers anymore. I'm seeing wearing well fitted surgical mask cloth mask monumental burden. flu season, choice people accepted flu reasonable risk.

For COVID-19, generally society (most states world) deemed reasonable risk wear mask, thus mandates. There's reason take mask mandate right score political points. Zero. could open 100% still keep mask mandate going way give businesses, schools, etc. leverage enforce mask policies, least May/June people vaccinated.

With masks low cost burdensome requirement, there's zero scientific reasons remove roughly 50% population vaccinated (which would sometime May / June go rate going). kind dumb do.  hope people held inability understand people say, misinterpret predictions well.  mean doesn't, feels like getting rewarded mismanagement.

That said, begrudgingly believe vaccines go prevent loss life. None current vaccines clinical trials will. None contain live viruses. Exactly!! ‚ÄúTwo weeks flatten curve!‚Äù Well last year indication won‚Äôt big difference lockdown vs lockdown states everyone ignore month politically inconvenient. Anyone else feeling regardless whether people latch onto vaccines reducing transmission, things outcome? Like even becomes narrative don‚Äôt all, would awful, people probably gonna stop wearing masks point time. vaccine make like magic shield around you, would awesome though.

If virus particle gets hits right part cell, getting in, technically infection. immune system probably respond really quickly vaccinated, less likely disease (symptoms). hoping antibodies (or T-cells, etc.) take care virus gets cells, possible, maybe cases likely. 

There drugs prevent kinds infections completely, think certain fungal infections. they're vaccines. makes sense also harmful essential workers. praised heroes left dust right now. coworkers feeling completely forgotten one half dose mistake also less sample.Many US raised concerns thier numbers.

That's said. even read comment? New state motto: Texas: We'll kill one way another! obviously joke I‚Äôm anxious Texas returning quickly haven‚Äôt vaccinated enough population. hope turns best them, concern they‚Äôre moving quick especially close. would feel better happened April/May. Exactly! Oh god everybody, said line! live US, June 1.  It‚Äôs nitpicky, I‚Äôm sick seeing people use ‚Äújust‚Äù ‚Äúa little longer‚Äù reference waiting lift restrictions. It‚Äôs fucking year. ‚ÄúJust 2-3 months‚Äù ‚Äúwait little longer‚Äù like nails chalkboard me. Restrictions burden, I‚Äôm sick seeing people handwave away personally enjoy home indefinitely. Baker control pharmacy program. vaccines 95% efficacy worthless!!11""

I never seen sentiment sub. anything, I‚Äôve seen people go overboard breathless enthusiasm much game changer J&amp;J vaccine (the one worst efficacy results) be. think going make huge difference. fucking cringe dude. Stop embarrassing yourself. Need Texas (and say living Texas). Houston confirmed cases every known variant we‚Äôre dropping mask mandate opening businesses 100%... I'm aware. plan wear mask flu season though, find much monumental burden.

I'll certainly sure vaccinate better staying home sick, extent effort I'm willing put in. cost stupidity No, pharmacy program federally run receive doses directly federal government. taking direction Biden already moving forward starting today. Post-vaccination* fixed. Get second dose Monday! Also getting married October Jesus christ, heard term since differential equations class college 10 years ago. remind You‚Äôre downer. realistic questions reasonable answers yet

Months waiting much talked vaccines little planning available phase denial government early March last year (which made loose sleep bring kid school week). Internet forget anything 2020: lol America shithole 3rd world country üòÇ

2021: America plz helpü•∫ feel really bad college students right now. missing best years life, getting proper education despite paying huge amounts money. colleges treated like prisoners. seen anything Canada? know deaths hospitalizations much lower US, vaccine rollout slow. 65yos getting vaccine May provinces.  here. meant ignorant last night, 7-day average new cases (65,468) summer peak (66,784 July 25, 2020). Source: NYT. Yeah attack windmills amazing me, considering thousands Tehachapi, CA snowed every single winter always keep running fine. know that. wasn‚Äôt clear writing. I‚Äôve sick Based  wife LOVE Alamo Drafthouse. two locations are, pre-covid would go probably week Friday Saturday evening. Despite chain, certainly feel cold corporate like movie theaters area. LOVE no-bullshit attitude, awesome food drinks (seriously, best popcorn I've ever had). overall charismatic fun environment see great movies really good memories together going locations.

&amp;#x200B;

Word street one location hometown coming back apparently struggling financially even pre-covid (which find hard believe). longing day safely go back, thought closing good absolutely heart-breaking. hope pray I'll get experience again. Don‚Äôt think Republicans bad taste film. know won‚Äôt going theater, mean come on, dumb generalization.  say ""fewer kids died covid flu""... realizing that's masks, distancing, distance learning... FFS got dose 1 covid vaccine rite aid 1.5 hr drive away. Looking CVS, appears would let schedule second dose one locations 25 minutes away. Would wrong ethically speaking schedule second CVS cancel original rite aid one? don‚Äôt want take anyone else‚Äôs dose, doesn‚Äôt affect anyone else would make things much easier preliminary results. better data line surely freedom important one data people 65? states never mask mandates left mandates localities instead. see mandates one city/county, next. Highly doubt  disagree Texas' decision open 100% remove mask mandates (though think much change Austin Houston), whole ""there bodies street"" rhetoric sub twitter ridiculous ahistorical.

We saw type rhetoric Florida Georgia ended shutdown back late April, cases rise initially, rise June, due people going indoors coincided surge found more-restrictive California many Latin American countries. recent wave, states like Florida followed similar curve California despite significantly less restricted, less severe curve New York. Pretty much. took one semester also got dropped university reapply, appeal switched previous catalog, otherwise I'd take like 9 courses opposed ONE left summer. 

Thankfully get vaccine Thursday I've got eye jobs grad school missed boat 2021 application cycle. Humoral immunity *is* antibodies (and molecule freely floating extra cellular fluids). name comes ‚Äúhumors‚Äù, aka bodily fluids. 

Everything else falls cellular immunity. That‚Äôs totally possible. It‚Äôs also possible Texas gets better holds serve.  What‚Äôs disgusting people upset doesn‚Äôt get worse. Good luck. need nervous. It‚Äôll fine sure Masks monumental burden society, especially pretty much time frame going end. Ending mask mandate point politics, science. Probably latter  agree. People want Panacea , magic pill cures covid cases type ever overnight, instantly opens economy, immediately gets people back work , recover whatever last year depressed reduced wages case . 


The real answers science, science research , research takes time, process finding best answer sometimes research takes long road.  


We're process fighting Covid 100% understand Covid strains reality apparently horrific many Oh god, originally read headline ""Kanye."" 

I like ""Leave narcissistic mofo want million doses *himself. Gotta vax egos."" Keep mind they‚Äôre embargoes world keep stuck 50‚Äôs ‚Äúomg communism.‚Äù

This pretty impressive. Cuban medical game point. gonna mum gets fully vaccinated J&amp;J shot. I'll still following precautions stores/buildings set ass bout honesty I'll 90% normal. I'm ready another Billy Joel concert...also Phish &amp; Dead&amp;Co summer tour would amazing.

give music events. every band trying book stuff can't wait.  This. many Texans saying this. doesn‚Äôt matter. They‚Äôve want entire time Yea same, it‚Äôs good Nah, Texas everyone expendable. number tropical places illnesses high fatality rates.  buying website mentioned while- KN95s quite lot N95s now. news broke ordered latter I'm ordering partner wear N95 grocery store henceforth. He's using cloth masks. many factors go whether measure work reduce R 1. Masks one many factors. Masks really much people take private gatherings social distancing. We're vaccinating quickly make much difference, happily. really love Holocaust comparisons, fundamental misunderstanding Holocaust carried out, key propaganda keeping population indifferent enough plight Jews speak it. 

By contrast, vaccine programme extremely open well known, plenty readily available information vaccines distribution. also know dozens people received ill effects; conspiracy theorists supposed believe people too?

Basically, conspiracy theory like wholly based poor understanding science history. excellent demonstration fact final solution actually began 1942, 1940. predictions deaths COVID mostly mitigated cases sharp decline different countries:

Israel: Hospitalizations deaths single digits beginning April sharp decline cases seen early mid April. Tbh I'm surprised cases declining much expected even though they're clearly declining. Deaths always like two four weeks behind decline deaths pretty impressive!

UK: Hospitalizations deaths fall lot next month, comfortable number deaths every day May (I'm talking 30-100 week) Herd immunity end May beginning July (but see one dose works infections). 

USA: Hospitalizations deaths low mid-May. Herd immunity mid-June (even though depends many antivaxxers are)

EU: Hospitalizations deaths low early June. Herd immunity mid-July.

&amp;#x200B;

If there's fourth wave UK, US EU hospitalizations deaths may slow soon deaths happen 2 4 weeks infection though.

I see normal life June UK USA normal life late July early August EU normal life say around 95% normal, 4% wearing masks 1% going massive events indoors think stupid Abbott it‚Äôs like Texas really shut begin with. think it‚Äôs political part. Make big announcement opening people haven‚Äôt wearing masks shutting begin with.  saw writing year ago. I'm surprised still chugging along. Getting Pfizer vaccine (first dose) today. I‚Äôm pumped! think you‚Äôre 1. selfish 2. stupid, weakling. kind people compassionate people workers must around them. Adios. Florida distinct advantage California NY lower latitude higher humidity. natural, built-in, buffer severity spread. small portion Texas similar benefits; mostly along coastline.

I'm fine opening things back up, acting like virus longer exists. Mitigation still essential helping prevent exponential spread help prevent lockdowns. seriously still getting don‚Äôt understand simple concept escaping you. Even link table studies includes grand total 0 randomly controlled studies masking Covid-19 infection prevention. think masks work? Yes. think RCT would prove effectiveness? Yes. arguing use? No. still understand randomly controlled means? Oh absolutely. Isn‚Äôt bad take masks off, especially neck gaiters exposed part comes contact part touches face over? You‚Äôre potentially raising risk catching something, although it‚Äôs still minimal risk. I‚Äôm part running group it‚Äôs advised since beginning avoid neck gaiters.  Many can‚Äôt take semesters due requirements scholarship and/or financial aid. 30 days everyone eligible means Yankee Stadium, MSG Billy Joel concerts, Broadway 100% capacity. meant govt supplier could say it, happens every empire. guy interesting points, including taking steps prevent collapse ensures happens, would complete. still can't believe started giving without phase 3 clinical trials. allowed. got lucky. could gone terribly wrong. difference Florida Governor overrules local authorities. DeSantis much jackwagon is, removed things state level, however differed mostly left enforcement local authorities. He's least going way way make life difficult many county judges.

Abbott AG Paxton hand, even let El Paso lockdown literally 100% hospital capacity prisoners morgue work ran people. turn comes I‚Äôll wear shirt says ‚Äúrosy skies ahead‚Äù Maybe sometimes, whether business requires masks, absolutely criteria. 

But mostly, people China going sewing soccer balls together teeth whether buy soccer ball not.  way world changed changing. 

What passes boycott today last long anyway. saw furor Goya beans months ago nobody would buy again. People still pick shelves eat them. people claiming they're maintaining black list, probably buying business first place. window dressing. Ah yes wonderful ""southern hospitality"" southern friendliness work!  pretty drastic rise cases many countries mask mandates put place. Haha, lol, I'm 18. fight Great War, survive Hitler's death camps. spend whole life wondering family still alive knowing got kicked home. certainly getting lynched like American black teens risk of.

What going right sucks, pains bad pains losing sports seasons, high school college milestones, year extensive social interaction, pales comparison young adults teenagers suffered throughout parts 20th century. get perspective, buddy? British Columbia it‚Äôs same. province premier literally said camera kids don‚Äôt get Covid school cases teachers‚Äô fault. Students don‚Äôt wear masks seated yet somehow miraculously time multiple students class get Covid, caught outside school, course.

(One school literally bolted windows shut teachers couldn‚Äôt open ventilation, too.) way? dig look actual study statement see referring to, usually one three things... either 1) infection (any) 2) serious illness/death 3) symptomatic infection. believe Israel 85% number 1 shot protecting serious illness/death. numbers quoted section are, ""protection symptomatic Covid.""

Really #2 important one three listed, higher %s see, like 85% Israel. that's see wildly different numbers. compare data (1, 2 3) locations.  putting going back college COVID. never excited get screwed college life. Many Republican controlled states (such Texas) prohibit counties municipalities imposing mandates restrictions beyond state requires. Meaning city Austin Harris County can't mask mandate unless state one. getting downvoted get joke. Assuming referring K-12, vaccine approved anyone age 16, yet.

If referring Higher Ed (as I'm assuming comment) higher academia pretty sure opens Phase 3 Agreed. Still, silly tell someone 'get car die, missed' since rare would actually happen. idiots. talking Canada anyone reading. everyone option. institutions quite cagey whether would accept applications deferment. cases people offered spot partial full scholarship, essentially told, take risk later. don‚Äôt see incentive almost business care whether you‚Äôve vaccinations. Want go EDC Las Vegas? Can‚Äôt imagine they‚Äôre going care whether vaccinated Measles. Want go sporting event? Can‚Äôt imagine caring either. don‚Äôt even think required community spread Covid gone becomes sort seasonal flu.

There rational reason considered important. cultural political. there's social media cancellation/hate campaign says ""EDC care safety Americans light (some germ),"" that's enough EDC care patrons' vaccine advertise events exclusively reserved vaccinated people. sign vaccine passports become normal thing, we're signing permanently control ways intersect future cultural political trends, including health scares even thought of. ‚ÄúWait vaccine‚Äù cutoff point. I‚Äôm ‚Äúwaiting variant booster‚Äù, ‚Äúwaiting 16 vaccine‚Äù, ‚Äúwaiting see first endemic wave fall looks like‚Äù.

My shot arm end pandemic. definitely thinking Montanaians. (Mon-tan-ay-uhns). yeah probably better. Er. meant even vaccinated jury still whether spread vaccinated. hope he‚Äôs correct don‚Äôt doubt prediction. think it‚Äôs reasonable WH make conservative/realistic predictions like end May hope moves quickly that. change subject national pandemic 500,000 + dead stressed health care system max times - flu? couldn‚Äôt husband hospital (not COVID related) danger. alone didn‚Äôt get care normally would hospital burden. level negative impact happen every year flu??? said, science says wear mask, I‚Äôll wear one. Houston Oklahoma City. I'm guessing new orleans, San Diego, San Fran, basically everywhere there's shit ton people shit ton travel. also filed chapter 11 bankruptcy... correct enforcement pretty laughable least threat something. Removing threat make much harder places want keep mask mandates place. know places could always put policies place going make much harder people want keep rules place.

I definitely understand wait could months legit able pull crap going create ripple effect. I'm sure ""hey, we're almost this, patient get vaccines approved J&amp;J one add supply chain"" means F-it rules need go! Amazing news. result drastic reduction deaths. that‚Äôs important thing. Point haven‚Äôt isolating year. claim factually untrue.  mean consuming food low risk? so, sharing air people cooked it, sharing air other. Touching consuming something contaminated really spread this. don‚Äôt get start dividing people groups can‚Äôt part society. That‚Äôs pinnacle evil. Dude, nobody really follows mask mandate Texas anyways. Sure might couple fights something going since mask ""mandate"" started. mask mandate Texas dumb arbritray first place. eat indoors, wear mask wait table. Every restaurant i've seen packed hasnt really noticeable difference ""social distancing"". place foresee causing problems rescinded mandate schools. Dumb parents force kids wear mask ""right"" wear one. I'll let people reading post determine making better point here. UK data show problem longer gap. Personally I‚Äôd rather better immunity marginal improvement weeks. 
Also reduced interval used truncate clinical trials, reasons efficacy. understand feelings agree way it‚Äôs done makes feel like deal broken. system really better should‚Äôve way along. 

And smartass, given money exchange labor. Would really come work age based system along? think information variants coming scientists?

Scientists say one thing media say another. Look Dr. Fauci's statements get misinterpreted, look happened asked masking 2022.

Dr. Fauci: *might* wear masks certain public places 2022

The media: DR. FAUCI SAYS WE'RE GOING WEARING MASKS ETERNITY AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

The news media business platform; goal share accurate scientific information, get people watch news channels, get clicks, push whatever agenda think get revenue.

Want accurate scientific information? Talk actual scientist follow publications prioritize talking actual scientists. Stimulus check! We‚Äôre still due another $1400 far know. scheduled shot vaccine today, 3 hours. thought would wait weeks im lucky guess. I'm bit nervous tbh I'm excited French ever happy anything? Tell New York without telling New York totally get Pre COVID things different (I definitely guilty going school sick order get docked points); using situation example still mitigate spread flu without requiring everybody wear masks. All‚Äôs I‚Äôm saying mask mandates flu season indeed pretty outrageous idea consider less wasteful &amp; distasteful alternatives, flu vaccination campaigns strongly recommending masking flu-like symptoms stop spread flu. collectively learned bad things get don‚Äôt take certain precautions, hope people responsible going they‚Äôre ill.

The time mask mandate outrageous fact likely completely right thing flu variant like H1N1 potential lot damage, novel sickness like coronavirus bodies haven‚Äôt exposed past, contagious variant highly dangerous disease tuberculosis, emerge general public.

Didn‚Äôt mean anything it, trying give arguments mask mandates right thing things return normal. definitely think they‚Äôre appropriate things abnormal, respiratory illness pandemic like one we‚Äôre right now.

Got cough? Wear cloth!

Feeling sick? Mask quick!

Slogans like would lot better ‚ÄúSection 420.69(y) FLU SEASON MASK MANDATE: first Monday October second Saturday April (flu season), masks shall required worn individuals public places, regardless health status. comply penalized fine greater $200 first offense. fine greater $600 shall administered second offense. offenses beyond shall result charge public endangerment levied upon offender, jail sentence longer 30 days, well attending less 9 hours mask-school‚Äù.

A little extreme get point. One leaves pretty bad taste mouth. That's late means. Taking inexpensive action tremendously slow spread extremely profitable even disease containment. 

I agree argument probably applies South America. read article saying Travis county keeping mask mandate. gov said counties put restrictions place can‚Äôt stringent 50%. implies pretty strongly cities still thing. point. people Texas elected officials, make remarkably difficult find empathy shit hits fan. people Texas live elect officials, feel bad every level. Well, I'd think maybe walk place mask old days it'd raise lot suspicion -- yeah, used see signs time places like 7-eleven saying kind face covering prohibited -- unless religious nature. (Yeah, stop them...)  time ready go live we‚Äôll probably herd immunity won‚Äôt needed.  Except lots immunocompromised individuals died covid-19. Saying hardly anyone 40 dies saying hardly immunocompromised individuals died 40 data speaks wonderfully itself. example, humidity reduces viral transmission. cold weather sets humidity drop 20%. Florida weather indoor air least 60% allows droplets drop air, slashing transmission. hard facts.

I agree unfortunate JB take steps install ambient air humidifiers entire state affect climate, end deserves bad marks. short coming technology exist anywhere world scale, JB really knocked park. Again, takes informed facts. That's viruses work. body easily host one simultaneously. big concern coming winter actually people catching COVID influenza time, worse symptoms / higher chance dying still spreads enough people wear masks' 'influenza transmission dramatically supressed people wear masks' completely consistent statements. COVID known contagious flu ([R0 1.3 influenza vs. 2-3 measures slightly reduce spread (like incomplete mask wearing) **dramatically** reduce spread influenza. oversimplified example, measures reduce respiratory disease transmission 1/3, R value influenza drops 0.86, less one, means effectively spread. Whereas COVID would still least 1.3, rapidly growing outbreak. Merck won‚Äôt even fill plant whatever going May 0.02% sequenced cases P.1. publish data time period though current prevalence really known. I'm pretty confident saying main difference Houston they've sequenced 20,000 cases. thing ""conspiracy"" folk saying 8 months ago, based well documented science immune response Sars (original) showing immunity decade later. Glad see mainstream media finally caught up. Lori seem similar causes friction IMO wife teacher UK... windows wide open winter. cases school Japanese cannot see light.I scared another variant born waiting. Getting mine tomorrow, cant wait us drink wet markets brazil. Anyone know much adult population US vaccinated overall population. Trying work many adults left offered vaccine  Please . can't afford , numbers bad reopening . Ya something tells won‚Äôt fly Texas loathe wearing mask, trying understand people wearing masks but...‚ÄòI guess life now. Oh well Gen Xer here, mentality drilled heads Kindergarten High School. concept mental health day similarly treated blasphemy.

I lucky mother went back school Psychology teenager starting go importance mental health teenagers college psych majors. Jesus, really want post obvious bullshit like this. multiple states without mask mandates with, surprise surprise, private businesses still enforcing mask and, another surprise, people wearing mask. overblown obnoxious posting every place enforcing mask since exactly SOP everywhere without mask mandate already. ""huh, well guess that's good"" type story, ""BREAKING NEWS gonna die!!!!!"" type story. still widely reported top trending hashtag twitter. Yeah worded horribly. Meant two states give solid idea True, true. Still can't get mine Texas probably able while... governor busy trying kill asses Merck much anything then. source regurgitating far right extremist propaganda? here's another video full good news.I'm glad guys.
We (Japanese)are waiting Pfizer send us enough vaccine.

Our schedule getting late late.Only days ago,local government website (One Tokyo23 ward)said ""We vaccinate adult September""

Now text vanished.I asked call center confirm.Now one know Adults underlining condition (Our family worrying niece remission leukemia)

This really political.I understand to?maybe want to?act political way,but emotion family member taking over. correct, however one stopped travel even later. could've isolated china even Wuhan areas quick may much shorter issue had. nice. can't right, maybe meant 144 million doses? Japan 126M people. Fair play! hope masks become permanent winter attire tbh. Warmer face less flu, what‚Äôs love? Wow, I‚Äôm sorry hear happened child. agree, there‚Äôs fine line job going completely overboard excessive force amounts assaulting child candy. I‚Äôd venture say locations employees aren‚Äôt like this, I‚Äôm sad deal one asshole employee ego size Montana. hope dealt accordingly. I'd imagine lifting mandates soon well. Opening sure keeping mask least see long vaccines last.. Hopefully hella long time seem like know yet. like years people back last summer handicapping vaccine results anyone published phase 2 data.

People claiming would unmitigated disaster Oxford succeed Pfizer Moderna vaccines would guaranteed awful. that, looks like AZ almost effective Pfizer stopping spread! worst option bunch, doesn‚Äôt mean isn‚Äôt amazing option. Europe really fucked here. bad advice. People go get vaccine move past COVID. 

If truly believe ‚Äúno new normal,‚Äù clearly do, encourage people get vaccinated end this.

Also, good public health campaigns put pressure citizens make changes prompt take action. It‚Äôs we‚Äôve managed make huge strides public health 20th century. Welp, good thing private property exists trespassing right. ""oh think children"" BS, different antivax BS

Point reproducible, peer-reviewed study reputable journal shows masks hindering social development interaction children. I'll wait. Well vaccines aint coming states.

From understand, FEMA vaccination sites pharmacy rollout controlled Feds.  think Trudeau really liked compared Trump. believe talks vaccines finish line different variants vaccines effective began popping everywhere states. 

If people drop masks early variants spreading, vaccinated not, variants time opportunity dig communities, time play around not-so-effective current vaccines mutate point current vaccines could become way less effective. 

Masks distancing important still point time regardless vaccines mitigate amount spread new variants could achieve otherwise. least majority US population vaccinated, looking like summer. ‚ÄúMay‚Äù ‚Äúalmost‚Äù . propaganda. survival rate like 95% among weakest demographics talking about?

And anyways, ask go broke like many us business owners would happily stay open 100% this? onus us? immunocompromised unwilling work figure survive. past year. 

They'll go broke, die. Remember.. lives profits, right? simple. prepared another potential outbreak, whereas Texas not. positivity rate wonderfully small. deaths high, again, that's viral load high due drier air. informed person like aware one key benefits vaccine reduction viral load, causing health effects COVID minor non-existent would otherwise experience them. Humidity contributes same. Experts known decades, since choose deal facts rather feelings, aware this.

These measures show looking outcomes. That's like congratulating kid born rich rich, giving equal accolades poor person becoming rich. Quite silly, us informed people recognize things. GOT HIGHER GPA BABYYYYY don‚Äôt think anybody listening Fauci anymore. fell tbh :/ Like opening state amid pandemic distract failure regulating energy companies letting people cold? friend keeps bringing variants continue wear *two* masks vaccinated.

Just nuts. hope okay. Looks like filed Bankruptcy Eh apparently ton people booed handful put masks this. maybe whole bunch unseen factors people even care about, [like surge student  Thank responsible! No, right variant become dominant strain ~90% UK cases. already coping vaccine dealing further. major reason England particular big recent wave, time known transmissible already late prevent. flu Covid different diseases, it‚Äôs really important get shot. 

I‚Äôm attacking you, attacking logic you‚Äôre presenting. I‚Äôm sure pressured would change view this. 

Good public health campaigns put pressure people take action. There‚Äôs entire body health communication literature speaks this. least Osterholm political power know ADH sounds amazing. Might add seeing movie bucket list. shame vaccine programme extremely slow especially since think yiu guys also ordered vaccines per capita. Hopefully picks soon seem hallucinated actually posted. 

I made zero arguments masks based liberties rights. made arguments masks complementary measures based hinders child development social interaction. 

I whole-heartedly support wearing mask response novel virus vaccine. vaccine distributed, time take mask.

Anyway, OP deleted post. AstraZeneca really good image right now. 62% efficacy preventing disease, useless South Africa variant, cancelled shipments countries effective variants. bad image Cops going respond trespass complaint. need reason (e.g., refusal wear mask) kick someone property.   hope people still takes seriously don‚Äôt go back November   month later Texas seeing spike cases? disappointed? thanks   Cool. Given clearly person science, I'll leave quote ""Nonetheless, moves."" Demonstrating wrong post is.

I'll let figure said it. know lot friends 19/20 got vaccinated. think campus workers university. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

I really don‚Äôt understand point comment. Fortunately small population, hopefully get people vaccinated quicker.

But yes, it'll longer achieve herd immunity seeing natural immunity, like said.   agree. U.S. 50 states present challenges. Oh God. hope not! clusterf@@k. true all. way I‚Äôm cool losing masks lose restrictions getting vaccinated least fair chance... science, luck, happened work out. Don't. would actually flattered it. also societies don‚Äôt value individualism. do. Timmy D? think JB ""good state leadership"" IL? I'd argue he's bungled horribly. outcome perspective, higher average unemployment worse coronavirus outcomes (vaccine rate (20th now, bottom 3 while) + corona deaths (14th highest)) vs states basically lockdowns last 6 months FL, GA, SC

Texas marginally higher hospitalization rates they're roughly normal. point vaccination progress, states aggressively reopening, triple since states already ill effects. ""An abundance caution"" longer outweighs benefits. Try CVS, availability today. likely need drive 1 hr+.  
   
Publix butthole time get appointment.   
  
Source: signed multiple FLs up. got headache hour later can't certain vaccine related since fairly regularly get headaches anyways. that, minor arm pain. got banned - say rule violated. asking finally muted :)

Try posting positive stuff India viewpoint disagrees usual left view, ban would come soon too. Save children isn‚Äôt ultra liberal.
At rate vote western states like South Dakota worst. Fair enough. best then. Wearing masks caring hardships others, protecting them. hurts one wear mask. Masks didn‚Äôt cause lockdown. virus did. Masks barriers defense common person employ protect around them. ‚ÄúMaking decision‚Äù wear mask makes problem- viral spread - worse. **That** problem, governments failure act - what‚Äôs causing hardships people you‚Äôre upset - somehow blaming for.  flip side, stop treating people stayed home sick needed like utter crap. wanna mask year round, means. 

but Stores workplaces thankful forced wear masks well, though co-workers noticed younger people seem get hit hardest second shot whereas older people associate pretty much side effects. Maybe something robust immune system providing robust immune response? Even various strains? Alright. I'm even sure I'll getting Pfizer one I'm eligible yet.  understand comment. states prioritized restricting women's health guise ""saving children""over things like good economy, education opportunity working middle class Americans. also done effectively nothing combat COVID. Studies show COVID leaves children susceptible becoming long haulers, long term effects like weakened heart muscles reduced lung functioning. 

If ""Save Children"" fact liberal group, wishes states protect children families pandemic, mean conservative states **not** actually interested saving children? COVID 2: VARIANTS GONE WILD.

COVID 3 also production. Working title COVID 3: THREVER PACE forgot moving goalposts. Question mark doesn‚Äôt mean ineffective. Pfizer included lots overweight people American trial, efficacy maintained pretty standards throughout. rose country Under-promise, over-deliver.  drifting away originally arguing with, ""if nation smart people 500k dead"". Take look NZ's 2020. start earlier lot countries implemented similar measures failed. got lucky.

Also, lockdown got politicized anti trump thing do. 

But anyway, still going NZ, who's situation totally impossible replicate now, irrelevant serves feed ego 'oh I'm much smarter everyone around me'.

Also thing before, stupid think NZ 'nation smart people'. There's obviously dumb smart people everywhere Good news, would even better news EU damn deal Novavax finalized. taking long? Masks protect others. 
What views drink driving? Come let‚Äôs vaccinate faster! want go back bar Fauci, make recommendation.  Arm hurt couple days touched wrong, minor fatigue 24 hours, that‚Äôs all. Yes. love grandma. Take vaccine normal. reason based data says protected it.

The Italian study showed approximately two fold decrease antibodies generated vaccine. still well protective level. good news? reached herd immunity via vaccines yet, risk spreading different variants exist. ‚ÄúThe sons bitches really got me.‚Äù  Assuming papers prevalence virus Manaus accurate, dynamics that:

People previously infected COVID-19, vaccinated, substantial T-Cell response significant degree protection severe illness death. however become infected infect others.

People previously infected COVID-19 vaccinated, highly vulnerable regardless.

New P.1 variant comes along, spreads easily even previously infected vaccinated spread disease extent, P.1 variant seems spread somewhat quickly, like UK variant, resulting greater proportion population requiring immunity herd immunity achieved first place. first wave remains significant part population infected, new variant spreads quickly population, despite causing significant harm previously infected.

A similar variant spreading UK US etc following widespread vaccination would mostly serious health risk people vaccinated. great hear. worked years ago really care employees, pay decent wage, provide great benefits. Hopefully set precedent businesses Texas. Yes virtually open months cases steep decline regardless? saying despite lack mandates and/or enforcement, cases dropping? use mandates enforcement anyway? makes think direct correlation case counts severe outcomes? news whether someone vaccinated spread disease? never that, left states enforce whatever covid regulations see fit. Thats seeing here, Texas repealing covid restrictions discretion. Trump actually opposite politicizing virus. Great, that's feared, people would pushing masks flu season irony he‚Äôs antivaxxer.   Meanwhile people 30-50 exist. suppose, that‚Äôs said March. We‚Äôre almost finish strong.

And adults done there‚Äôs still kids get long covid aren‚Äôt going vaccine fall 2021 spring 2022.

I‚Äôm hope. goal day get end day alive. There‚Äôs three dates anymore. Yesterday, today tomorrow. I‚Äôll either make enough tomorrow‚Äôs see become yesterday won‚Äôt. France relatively poor job vaccinating 80+ population, compared 94% UK. don‚Äôt want wear sake antivaxers, don‚Äôt think fair. time implemented restrictions, already little late giant impacts elsewhere. Hopefully, restrictions future, right. mask protect shaking hands? serious right now? It‚Äôs re-elected ignorant constituency.  state local elections draw much different demographic federal elections. get twice? helpful? haha. government would done jobs locked harder might avoided present situation, that‚Äôs happened.

See New Zealand Australia. 27F arm hurt that‚Äôs heck? Everyone know (in Orlando) anything remotely medical related managed get vaccinated December January.  still carrier

There literally one recorded case happening. Isreal, nearly proven incorrect.

I continue follow Covid guidelines required, fortunately, means dont wear mask dont want too.  Texas virtually 100% opened months. thing really protecting people face mask rule. limits many people places one followed them. Even like 75% capacity limit set fire Marshal.

Yes. ample evidence using much sophisticated rigorous science supporting use masks. Come again? fine, masks, winter. combining social distancing via closing schools businesses, social shame gather public.
