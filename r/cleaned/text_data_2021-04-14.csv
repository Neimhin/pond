Unless there's future complications... seems entirely possible. one schedule tomorrow don’t worry. super confused fast I’m working symptoms wondered anyone else like Yeah wish known. health insurance I'm 26 worried able get second shot. Maharashtra blamed Maharashtra. may typically trust center, definitely never trust Penguins. wife got that, 30s.

. . . Forget it. need worrying anymore. I'm glad vaccinated now. Fuck. read details. Would surprised means let die doctors network busy. Please read headline comment again. like, general. Individual people becoming sick requiring medical attention something drags whole economy level. publically funded system focuses preventative care, distributes cost throughout population means fewer people choose wallet care need, live life without lot stress greater freedom. people work eligible everyone know got vax didnt fair, logically inconsistent say denominator smaller risk (which fair may true), also supporting removing access everyone. going point certain groups people risk risk rate, advocating restricting groups people Yes yes yes yes! Bye bye Covid, history books you. sympathisers forget 'common cold' fantasy. send australia. Get covid test, way know Pretty sure vaccines stopped blood clots rare cases, cases suggest long-term. that's me.

I've COVID. sucked. Still can't smell anything since January. 32 years old. really care anyone calls me. I'm never taking vaccine. I've allergic reactions many things life autoimmune disorder. 

I know get get COVID again. know I'd get vaccine. future.

Not anti-vaxxer. Never be. ones? Scare shit me. think private businesses free wish. I’m talking target Walmart requiring cards enter. I’m talking vaccinations required air travel, cruises, festivals, concerts, forth. Yes, think it’d encourage fence vaccine wish participate things get vaccine. Funny Scandinavian countries often seen logical base countless decisions empirical data yet totally kneejerking vaccine.

The number clots millions cases miniscule statistically irrelevant. vaccinate MILLIONS people youre going vaccinating people underlying health conditions (these people initially vaccinated!) chances would experienced similar existing within period time. January: probably ditch masks social distancing Memorial Day

April: May early, July 4? Well congrats! took reading said like 3 times sunk in, haha.

Anyways, okay sure, regardless still shit load people would need classified Covid death fully vaccinated. millions people vaccinated, large portion 65+ serious comorbidities, anyone hospitalized dying within 30 days positive PCR test need reported. definitely minimum tens thousands. That’s want apples apples comparison reporting past year. Oh, two doses definitely goal, question. reason getting discussing one-dose efficacy is, well, people ony got one dose take 3 months (12 weeks) give second dose.

So meanwhile keep testing checking well working moment, sit asses 12+2 weeks discuss doses perform; think choice obvious. matters see performing midpoint, nothing else indicator see might perform long term.

And regarding stability, effectiveness, vary over-simplifications. numbers shared (67, 82, 93 percent) are, see thread people relevant sources, based different studies, different environments. Also mostly based phase 3 phase 4 studies, realistically small subset population (I think around 25k, sure). different strains, vaccines' effectivenes depend strain: see could skew results favor, agains specific vaccine. Apparently J&amp;J much better South African variant others (including Pfizer/Biotech).

Apparently, AZ Pfizer similar real-life effect rates UK, administered, sure numbers are.

&amp;#x200B;

P.S. Continue follow guidelines even second dose. understanding vaccine, including one, helps immune system, in, prevent infection, symptoms/death. basically might making *certainly asymptomatic* carrier, body might kill virus fast(er), fast enough stop spreading, keep wearing masks herd immunity achieved (and get vaccinated).

*\[Last paragraph personal understanding, statement fact, feel free research take granted.\]* Yeah must young, offense. amount stupid high get hamfisted arse business world. Fortune 50/100. ... unsettling sometimes. Australia hopefully. worry mate, rate country going we're expecting get vaccinated 2036 CDC recommends get covid shot within 2 weeks another vaccine shot.'

My state (NY) specifically asks got another vaccine within 14 days let schedule say yes Nearly people data illiterate. don’t care think. Ba- boom! far second jab appears present much risk.  disappointed end summer they're still place. Sorry. many people get doses? know counties opened 18+, 15th, people 50 ineligible. everyone fib?   rare occasion.....I’ve spent majority last year hiding away except work, missing holidays general gatherings sorts. 
I’m looking forward going friends, worrying it’s busy.  Same, 34, AZ problem all. Second dose 1.5 week - pretty excited saw talk mid late may, seemed rumor officially confirmed yet. Almost 80% people 65 received atleast 1 dose. Calisthenics legit love park gyms offer routines, personal trainers, comradery members, atmosphere, etc.
I like pistol squats want really train legs compare squat rack, dead lift platform leg press machine. went get ""free"" covid test middle last year due illness, cost $300. $240 office visit, involves never getting car, $60 five minute follow call result... Luckily I'm still parents insurance covered insurance would've much time.  Probably combination survivors building immunity, non-pharmaceutical interventions like masking, distancing, hygiene quarantines, possibly virus mutating less destructive endemic form. still find genetic traces 1918 pandemic today's seasonal flu strains. Ever heard little thing called herd immunity? One person vaccinated - majority herd unvaccinated = need wear masks still. It’s forever post completely removes context reality situation bad faith. Yeah thing tell customers free seem genuinely shocked. second Pfizer Monday 18 hours later got hit felt like intense flu: 100.8 fever, chills, shattering teeth, totally exhausted stomach cramps. Lasted three hours fine ever since! really seems different everyone! Go cvs website covid vaccines link specifically people need second dose got first dose elsewhere. Keep checking availability you’ll likely find something, that’s happened me. thought tough Rez doctor pin cushioned freezing finally 8th attempt finding right spot went idea suggest thing, then, knowing strongly southerners care rights. mean, personally saw store manager get laid telling guy put mask on. Granted, wearing one, either, half shoppers weren't, well.

I mean, honestly, think going work? would enforce this? police wear masks may even get vaccinated themselves?

Let's use common sense start suggesting random shit makes sense. got mine 9th. I’m 35. anxiety 9/10 day 5 people experiencing day 5-10 Ask. A. Doctor. Reddit. Nobody qualified help you. LabCorp still chasing insane labwork fees refuse pay for. doctor ordered Vitamin test (turns Vitamin deficiency). Insurance decided randomly cover Vitamin tests...as would known somehow. get bill LabCorp $500. single test. year back forth arguing insurance, tell file appeal letter doctor. call doctor's office, say idea I'm talking about, write appeal letters. Fuck that.

On another occasion labwork supposed insurance covered, got bill mail $1200. WTF. call insurance, tells denied got test state. Except get state.

So call LabCorp. Turns sent claim insurance central billing office, address next state over. say can't fix need call insurance company. call insurance company...they say can't fix it, need call labcorp. Eventually said fuck pay thousands dollars per year insurance fight themselves.

Been 6+ years without paying, somehow dinged credit score yet. pearls don’t clutch simple get shot get sick choice. There's significant overlap set people who've gotten COVID set people who've gotten vaccine. can't add 30% who've gotten COVID however many gotten vaccine, significant overlap. include people take morning pill case known error breakage condoms? much fewer side effects pill ongoing. course would also take abortion pill.  hear people cancel vaccine appointments getting vaccine shot sooner somewhere else, going delay herd immunity much Except a) vaccines provoke better immune response infection b) real world data posted sub show excellent protection infection least mRNA Oh ffs go away dolt. bother, people essentially ignore them, anyway.

And now, vaccine, people truly think ""it's worse flu"" - ignoring fact, course, real idea well vaccines functi9n, longer periods time. Correct doctors don’t explain this, least certainly didn’t wouldn’t. would however, insist governments stop lockdowns. inherently tyrannical. 

We played like fucking fiddle. NEVER stop demand it. slaves name safety.


You give government centimeter freedom take mile.  understand federal government paying providers $80 two dose injection service fee.

I bet insurance info insurance provider pay $80 government pays. [Check thread coworker told second Moderna shot felt tired bit slept HOUR day felt fine later, 50 skinny

those people sleeping 18 hours second shot probably pretty bad shape, judgement, never show You’re speaking armed southerner. one trying force anyone give medical rights. Private businesses free best interest.  Good. Every time see great study/peer-review like this, always think even proof possible evidence towards something positive, people already deny everything even numbers aren’t gonna listen anyway. I’ve learned people know can’t fight people already set narrative based negative aspect something. search negativity positivity, even though say “I want wait see happens”  received tetanus shot 8 days ago getting splinter stuck hand, I’m scheduled get second Moderna shot two days (10 days shots). fine receive shot Friday, look rescheduling it? state legislature Supreme Court made sure can’t that. vaccines catch stop surges like Israel, US able go back normal close year. see. Mybad know Canada using Coronavac.... J&amp;J specifically marketed one shot, people using such. Again, want effective vaccine, least documented side effects. Two doses? Three? works. That’s matters. crux argument halting usage using older age groups far less likely suffer severe covid hospitalised, say I’m happy wnough take risk. Surely government allow informed consent people like would take vaccine given get vaccinated quicker Yeah but, money Spot Colorado Covid Well shit! good news! got Pfizer. 10 days first shot 80% protection? dying draft beer inside got first shot yesterday. don’t think read correctly think did.  bloodbath.

Lol okay whatever say too! How’d feel? That's years social conditioning lol Oh damn. beach since started? Lol. charts shouldn’t making people feel good though, it’s tracking progress specific, measurable objective. yeah, trying force bunch armed southerners give medical rights. Seems like good long-term decision. like people getting killed telling others wear masks grocery store. 

I'd hate guy telling people can't come store without showing vaccine card. That's bad thing people eager vaccines. 

Here Seattle using 98% supplied doses something. Fantastic numbers. Unremarkable.

Right that's government rolling surge testing en masse parts London great cost, specifically root variant out.

Clearly scientists/government example, P.1 actually growing faster.

Another worrying variant, exactly clear growing relative strains. Hopefully are, aware Brazil seems quite cases reinfection unless you’ve also gotten vaccinated may still risk.

Orbán happened. turns reason 30 years ago change system, change become new King Hungary. I’m fairness Pfizer they’ve reduced storage requirements, yes it’s still far expensive vaccine.

I also find quite odd people taking whatever Pfizer report truth. people really think they’re cherry picking data sell products?

if month ago, might agree you. but, also matter PR. cannot anti vaxxers even shred legit argument. pain go far beyond covid next pandemic. 

and even JnJ vaccine available still wouldnt support CDC keeping going. thats presidential level decision. could look many people fully vaccinated 2 weeks go rough approximation. chances pcr test comes back false negative tested 2 days exposure? it?

Like develop side effects get free treatment?
Do get free medication shot? information question

Apparently body takes around 2 weeks build antibodies, almost additional immunity day vaccine increases sharply 2 weeks vaccine. That’s CDC uses 2 weeks second dose determine fully vaccinated. person isn’t troll, that’s absolutely insane. One died. Six others affected. believe term “fully vaccinated” they’re using referring 2 weeks second dose.  think unnecessarily putting large amount people risk playing monday morning qb field really expertise in.... Yeah, political move really helpful, even though needed all. add, obvious difference much small error matters. polls 2016 percentage points off. minimal impact issue polling results completely different outcomes election. Article stated little 396 hospitalization 74 death 40% infection age 60+ Good. month almost everyone wants vaccine one pretty much higher risk people offered. don’t want go stay home. think Polis (and DeWine Ohio) good job balancing public health education, economy mental health unlike Desantis Cumuo went opposite directions wrong. Guess ought read bit letting someone inject something.....TWICE!!! Fun over, contract law everyone now!  means weigh risks vaccine risks giving vaccines slower. I'm convinced CDC really appreciating that.

It definitely true beyond coincidental occurrence E484K E484K like mutations across variants. seem like variants converging subset similar mutations regions fact new variants might easily spread/caught children fact long COVID also effects children plays well. know, I've reading much literature regarding that, it'll hard stress anything happens withing next 2 weeks. know miniscule still want become part 4 million statistic. bashing vaccine, essential lack options surge cases, thanks heads up. wait til anti-vaxxers complain unfair big pharma woke people US export ban announced December 20 I'm mistaken.

Hopefully wrong gets easier, lazy defeated. expect actually matter, dumb rule allowing schools something soon. mean pandemic pretty much point, schools going interested requiring masks anyway. exact scenario right Ontario. We've vaccinated LTC residents we're seeing outbreak deaths overall deaths currently low well. ICU numbers worst they've entire pandemic, ICU admissions trending towards much younger people last wave.

So got forced back lockdown although deaths low, hospitalization ICU numbers insane. Even restrictions, they're preparing triage guidelines get routed palliative care rather ICU online tool assesses 12-month survival probability less 20% (moving incrementally situation becomes severe).

We're expecting vaccinations eventually turn tide, around mid-July. politicians grudgingly re-implement lockdown. Everyone pandemic-fatigued elsewhere, got bad alternative.

The U.S. may go path though, since guys much, much faster pace vaccinations, ICU crunch starved pace vaccination guess.  dying struck lightning, matter. necessity speed mean throw away good judgement.... want speed go tell good folks fda need go approve oxford vaccine large concerns jnj one right? considered Gen-X? scheduled first dose Pfizer.

Lying public never works. public finds out, kills credibility.

A message “masking critical, please don’t go buy N-95 healthcare workers need more” would worked. people buying N-95s still would bought them, people donating hospitals still would have. several month head start masking would made huge difference.

Its nowhere near that. Haggling costs got EU trouble finds countries acted sooner embarked spending spree ensure supplies - fine example this, UK. Pfizer doses exported U.K. EU priority? simply ask somebody free.. No. medications potential side effects. Risks vs rewards. discounting seriousness it.

There initial response blatant lie masks would nothing unless professionally fitted medical masks.

They part try preserve medical supply chain, moments thought would tell would collapse regardless.

And part didn’t want admit dead wrong effectiveness masking decades. claimed years masking wasn’t reason Korea Japan lower flu rates, didn’t want lose face.

Slow early growth cases, total number would fraction now. That’s hundreds thousands millions lives. 

The month March time mattered, that’s time made dumbest, shortsighted decisions.

Firing everyone involved worth it, bring new blood, send message don’t keep job fuck six figure body count. actual 0 deaths day? due bundling data deaths? called joke bro, get stick ass.

And either way point shit. worried cost vaccine people getting paying taxes

So? Whether get vaccine taxes remain same, matter person worried cost pays taxes? First miss obvious joke trying use dumbass logic justify pointless comments. Obviously vaccine ""free free,"" mega-genius figuring governments work. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

I want go back normal meet industry peers, friends beer pub.. 

I'm worried getting covid, I'll likely bad complications. I'm mortified infecting parents though they'll sit rich countries fridges.  understanding variant growing simple, viruses multiply.

That's point, growing proportion pointed clear report linked several variants, P.1 (another E484K carrying variant) actually outpacing that’s conjunction widespread proliferation B.1.1.7

Yeah that's good either, fact variants concerned various reasons growing proportion overall variant mix. variants, friend. variants. maskless idiots spread new variants ( new york variant UK variant NYC) right 3 vaccines offer protection 2 three dominant variants idiots keep spreading new variants emerge. Look way this: pandemic, virus deadly, masks preventions way. joke: can't afford maskless idiots anymore. Technically boomer generation 57 years old (right now) them.., enough yet. I'll take Pfizer, Moderna, AZ J&amp;J. want go back normal life travel again. extremely small risk vaccines carry 1000x worth  give everyone 20 bucks getting shot. Everyone know immediately. Eventually kids going vaccinated order attend school. don’t see issue someone wants enroll children trials. Someone it. Delusional bong, lmao. lockdowns worked good past, sure need keep going.

for example - something lack ICU beds 14 months instead saying need protect healthcare system Somebody check math please looks like death rate almost same, ~1-2% populations. obvious difference probability catching drops dramatically jab.

It's great news, catch likely screwed. British media garbage, lmao.. Hundreds articles link, proven, ""Uk doctor"" found it, lmao. information tweet wasn’t submitted paper released article published. tweet came publication. 

Always attacking media without knowing wtf you’re talking boring. anyone know still spread virus although developed immunity(for example recovered individual developed anti bodies)? Maybe daft alarming thing article 78 deaths 5,800 breakthrough cases. Means 1.2% mortality rate get covid vaccinated. seems completely unvaccinated person. found way fuck economies much. order plebes stay home except work, blame staying home enough strategy inevitably fails. What? look countries eliminated COVID accepting people carte blanche.. regardless previously covid, vaccinated. require visitors go quarantine - even 100%.

All approaches failed. We're catching fast. Average vaccination rate 2.4mln per day now. One month ago 1.3 mln. We've vaccinated many people last month first 2.5 months vaccination.

I know reddit paints picture EU nothing failure regard, reality we're several weeks behind UK US likely vaccinate majority adults summer. Jesus Christ. pandemic started earnest mid March. April 2nd, CDC told people wear masks

We prepared. Science changes. fact person charge lying face months that

Get What??? 😂😂😂 Participants white next nothing efficacy safety lol. also tested India showed exact efficacy. deployed Latin America parts Africa, Middle East, Southeast asia etc. Sputnik V Chinese vaccines serving developing world right now. serving predominately white parts world 😂😂  Shame Europeans dying blood clots undermining public faith get back UK Brexit! vaccines developed like that. risk read us people react common Coronavirus vaccine. virologist worked bill gates said mRNA shots diminish body's ability fight common Coronaviruses. 74 deaths 5800 infections 1.2% fatality. either lot infections going unreported, fatality rate (once infected) unvaccinated people. really. weren’t enough cases formally link events vaccine, MHRA less cautious rest Europe likely due UK reliance vaccine. Yeah, racially diverse source. don’t need retain antibodies immune, That’s point. found time, people made public song dance finding whilst others conservative used official channels. Seems like doctors it’s bit vanity project found link Yeah, know holdup is. Japanese appliance manufacturers even made extra 10,000 super-cold freezers storing transporting Pfizer vaccine, like making effort prepare it. Yeah do. numbers work lol read article evident doctors likely came conclusion similar timeframes it’s approach shared information differed significantly. seems British doctor decided formally share information worldwide colleagues official channels whilst Germans wanted publish paper thus made big PR stunt didn’t share specific findings wider group, pretty abhorrent ask me. Like media reporting article didn’t go that? Easier said done: falling pray nocebo effect (which opposite placebo effect). Pfizer&amp;Biontech main one moment. AZ supposed main one, many blunders signed additional purchases Pfizer&amp;Biontech use remaining stock AZ (though countries completely stopped using it). Redirecting using Pfizer&amp;Biontech main vaccine basically main reason vaccination rates finally going EU. mean ""they"" whoever responsible Olympics events, like them. think IOC lose lot money cancelling altogether, think even option. logical explanation they're losing lot money what's happening postponing even cost even money. know makes confidant pandemic control 2021. shit people worried cost vaccine people getting paying taxes. literally contradictory contradictory types people don’t care facts. want new guy charge bungle things bad last guy charge. 

It’s happening way, rather admit wrong previous guy, create false narratives downplay new guy’s success. 

It’s straight-up gaslighting, doesn’t work anyone working brain literally see progress. Yeah sure. knew risks still said that. 
Of course, me, hearing J&amp;J issues AZ, I’m definitely going avoid favor Pfizer. 
I’m super grateful AE reporting robust discover even rare occurrences make informed decisions. 

The medical clinical systems place impressive—it’s pretty incredible time born pandemic response information-rich era. current numbers ECDC administered doses Pfizer 70.2m, Astra 20.2m, Moderna 6.5m. There's various reporting delays omissions these, numbers national authorities complete. deliveries J&amp;J vaccine started suspended, likely none administered. E.g. Sweden received first batch, put hold.

Outside EU purchase, Hungary administered 1.0m Sinopharm doses 0.69m Sputnik V doses. EU countries ordered received Chinese Russian vaccines approved EU, there's numbers actual administration those. article doctor dying taking MRNA vaccines 30 + people getting type blood disorders.
Makes wonder not-for-profit vaccines get singled out, vaccines making billions might still reflective efficacy someone expect general population vaccinations, point, prioritized senior citizens, seniors ones whose immune systems likely develop needed response, since age, immune system weakens. european, agree this. Ill take week paid off. “Have heard research”
“Billboard may right approach intolerable went back stuff far tell prove booster shot one variant. real trouble begins. know say said Bolsonaro far. piece garbage human being. add perspective this, 5800 cases, 396 hospitalizations 74 deaths among 77 million fully vaccinated individuals extremely good.

Even numbers one day, rather four months, they'd represent 7 percent cases 8 percent deaths making roughly 25 percent total population. vaccines J&amp;J AZ, understand want wait options I'm saying. point judging people wanting die side effects increased chance getting due medical reasons wait bit longer jab of, let's say, Pfizer. people might families take care of, knows personal circumstances have. Let's forget also humans numbers. bet it'll stabilise mid July also new variants may decrease sooner original one may right. Meanwhile people going bonkers massive religious gathering data places seem sketchy hell, numbers may even higher. case, states put curbs election rallies atleast. Like state declared lockdown know election drives ended yet. Although election drives conducted hastily now, certain lockdown hints coming rapidly. sad Cambodia, far done well pandemic, sensationalist misleading headline. 1,000 new cases 35 deaths within week neither seems control disaster extent facing parts world. also seems government addressing population largely compliant. vaccine also hugely reduced infections. Study Manchester uni demonstrated. begin opening slowly carefully good test trace plus community monitoring system expect fine.

Of course rush pub once, mate Matt Hancock pockets test trace budget find variants effectively suppressed vaccines already massive uncontrolled experiment.

Still, interesting. would appear authoritarians particularly bad managing pandemics two events related? ""horror"" scenario vaccine much P1 widely escapes immunity. 

its believe. reasonable human behavior. 
stressing miniscule risk healthy behavior. keep mind virus constantly mutating

its likely get less virulent. even becomes contagious. 
its also one moot points thats simply viruses do. 
you losing sleep flu suddenly becoming deadly again. happened 2 years ago btw.

stay calm collected overreact saying. California? I’d say 80-90 doable. Good chance protests black shootings wouldn’t nearly large were. Probably around Eric garner protest level big, still substantial protests saw summer probably biggest west seen decades. honestly wonder Sarah Everhard story would even make UK.

Furthermore obviously large increase anti-Asian hate violence. downside Biden might lost Trump. taxes. Everything costs someone money. Insurance supposed cover things like vaccines free charge. 200 thousand + seems descriptive 0.2 million I’d take whatever get. I’m happy better/best options here, glad vaccines aren’t pulled getting negative attention. one death J&amp;J vaccine US. focus person, also focus 6.8M people took J&amp;J vaccine, protected death nearly 100% next year so, even become infected Covid still raging. side effects death tragedy, many lives saved gasping death Covid ward. Since alternate vaccine, luxury use instead. lived parallel reality J&amp;J available, would better take it. people already taken it, lowered risk death considerably even considering clotting side effect. Nope, Slovakia's equivalent FDA EMA found discrepancies would political ramifications 2020 Presidential, Congressional, Senatorial Elections. speculate case rules, pandemic perceived response lack thereof measurably change things United States. Amidst vaccine drives, people stopped wearing masks forgot social distancing. result, second wave hit country live in. cases gone double first wave last year. Really terrified vaccination take months complete given population. official numbers far higher. There's lot underreporting going on. thing possibly think believe fucking conspiracy vaccines implanting microchips shit like that. matter is, love joke *natural selection* all, fact promoting kind shit killing people leading people uninvolved BS get infected. Small correction. Blood clots associated vaccine. small numbers it’s impossible firmly establish connection. seems likely based known rare side effect DNA vaccines correlation moment Could also tripping power, lord small kingdom muscle-heads Believe whatever want, keep mind virus constantly mutating. Hopefully get worse already is, real chance new variations emerge capable infecting dangerous children. facts change time progresses, good keep eyes open latest data avoid *absolute* statements like ""COVID nothing kids"". (adding ""probably"" would improved statement)

The statistics Germany might good, see article linked above, ""0.58% Brazil's 345,287 Covid deaths date 0-9 year olds - 2,000 children."" newer variants Brazil spread countries (and probably will), situation likely worsen. Canada's population 38 million, ""a million"". Canada produces airplanes advanced things, expecting manufacture vaccines unreasonable. felt advantageous sell manufacturing facilities private entities make money, crying foul countries (specifically US) prioritizing Canada ahead citizens. 

The UK much manufacturing capacity realized would need invested heavily last year. Canada do? Nothing. understand problem, need go back 1980s. time, government-owned Connaught Labs producing vaccines Canada decision-making public realm. Connaught partially privatized finally allowed sold French company Merieux (now part Sanofi) Conservative government Brian forward 2000s, Québec-based vaccine manufacturer IAF BioChem went couple sales ended owned GlaxoSmithKline No, way worried that. Worrying life threatening vaccine complications like worrying getting struck lightning. really doubt anyone actually thinks (about vaccine) it’s coming place reason. anyone data masks people work healthcare setting patient contact?
I work healthcare (admin) patient contact. new job given specific guidelines. wearing cloth mask came first day boss say anything. personally wear mask unless someone actually talking desk. 
I work room maybe one person. walk hospital night, enter patient rooms interact patients employees. Employees see wear masks, contact them. 
A coworker told wearing cloth mask said safe. guideline know one said anything one person. can't find good data whether wearing cloth mask reasonable patient interactions contact. Imagine racist. Sorry didn’t add that- contact GP straight away I’ve referred various consultants. It’s ongoing issue seems, don’t want go much detail anti vaxxers. suppose surprised one contacted me. Gp also reported think get 150 million vaccines. think struggle get 160 million,""

Obviously means 150M fully vaccinated since we're hit 200M vaccines already. Since he's board Pfizer, hope they're planning cut us get numbers....

Anyway, preposterous. I'm pretty sure we'll get least 70% vaccinated probably more. said done closer 90% 50%. i’m dickhead internet reading tea leaves get sense won’t see type stuff end summer that. state we’re projected around 50% fully vaccinated june, 70% little july 4th (know could change) knowing wishy-washy (but cautious good reason) folks setting guidelines/looking recent language “just keep it, gotta see,” real hard time seeing sort normalcy return early summer hope wrong. mean even basic level, something along lines “ok, sacrificed year good vulnerable, part got vaccine waited two weeks, go live life again!” resoundingly would nice literally seems like exactly people need hear we’re still learning long vaccines provide protection seems like lot still learn spread looks like people get vaccinated. can’t see people (at least chicago live) giving blessing go all-out back world massive street fests it’s contrary cdc guidance don’t see cdc guidance forgiving long time. really hope wrong someone opposite take ears! i’ve good sport w shit “small gatherings” wishy washy language starting piss off. give folks conservative date vulnerable population lock adequate vaccinations let people assume risk themselves. get slow play incrementally see #s look longer term implications trends it’s fuckin annoying lol Whether it’s good idea people aren’t going back. summer hits? Forget it. doesn’t matter it’s good idea not, it’s reality. Got second Moderna dose 9am PST. Currently 7:30PM PST zero major symptoms except sore arm. Anyway, different coverage can't use US UK data compare Pfizer AZ.

Agree, hysterical reaction AZ perplexing UK biggest sample size world see results from. Get pamphlets meth dealers, weed growers, food stamp people, include coupon free pint spirits, problem solved. almost roughly half older new yorkers vaccinated... tried get vaccine, told needed provide health insurance card, lady like sorry, need insurance. 

So say walked pissed understatement. Walgreens wanted insurance.  Imagine able get vaccine? state still available. Wow! Still trying persuade 50 yr brother free rider ( everyone else family vaccinated) I'm really curious came number - 7 million questioned prompted would take vaccine free, surveyors tell participants vaccine free questionnaire thus invalidating entire claim? Yea edited comment add yet. I’m going get vaccine There’s reason rush another test subject. Surely would knowledge speedy access enough mRNA. dying goal though?  hard google shit?? 
“Hmmmm, I’d like get vaccine wonder cost anything?” - 30 seconds later find answer government sponsored website saying it’s free regardless health insurance not. it?  saying don’t believe data? It’s made up?

Can't guy share opinion maybe wise use something unpredictable right now, alternatives, nope. going Iraq?

Dude. 

Seek help. increase vaccinations age groups, think tends happen. Someone job asked much paying get vaccine, around $500?

I gobsmacked. Ok honest question here, don’t see talked anywhere news articles needing reach 80% vaccination rates reach herd immunity. However one ever adds already infected number. Doesn’t mean current known infections 40-60% asymptomatic cases current vaccinations much closer herd immunity ?

I honestly don’t understand infections aren’t included number natural antibodies good vaccines. insane me. almost like bunch kids spending extended time exacerbates spread infectious disease.

you can't really say that... hitting particular demographic harder (youngish women)... could situation taking vaccine dangerous segment actually catching covid...

we better that... especially vaccines especially unpause better understood parameters around people taking jnj oxford vaccine better safety profile....

Yes, absolutely believe regards getting population vaccinated.

If primary secondary schools required attendance, bat eye.

If employers started paying $100 employee's got influenza shot, I'd happy.

If employers started requiring employment? Works me.

If public employers negotiating agreements unions influenza vaccination mandatory, would receive kudos me.

A federal state government wanted use tax dollars make influenza vaccine free everyone? Full support me.

As society, take influenza seriously enough. hope maybe work mRNA vaccines influenza produced lower lead times current egg-based production scientists accurately predict likely strains. higher efficacies, think we'll get people willing get influenza shots would able reduce loss life get vaccine, go Disney live life happily finally forget pandemic.

And Disney decides want require everyone get vaccine coming... allowed that. That's told me.

Regulators care deaths directly cause deaths allow happen, potentially 10-1000 times much. 

The deaths could prevented, never specifically identified victims allow happen. sign drug kills someone, easily identifiable victim. 

What means need regulators put public safety ahead personal image, hard easy regulators weasel claiming enough data (there never perfect data, experts use judgement face imperfect data, perfect data would need experts opinions.)

Wearing 2 masks outdoors fully vaccinated poor place right now. make suggestion ""if vaccinated dont wear masks outdoors."" think alotta states take sign willing give bone instead states like NH governor like ""well CDC isnt making forward progress guess will."" “Harm reduction” idea overly restrictive recommendations lead low compliance and, paradoxically, spreading virus faster, humanity limited amount patience. 

We learned (slowly, painfully) AIDS crisis. Obviously *real* way end spread AIDS would mass abstinence, that’s going happen. soon people started figuring out, threw caution wind started risky sex, “virus gonna virus” (sound familiar?). Eventually, medical establishment realized normalizing condom use regular HIV testing, less ideal, lot easier regular people follow, led much higher compliance, helped slow contagion enough treatments developed. 

Widespread extended lockdown way stop COVID tracks, it’s simply hard lot people comply with. debate whose fault is, rage selfish people are, it’s true statement fact. Widespread extended lockdown simply hard lot people comply with. Knowing know harm reduction, could said “obviously staying home safest course action, here’s stuff slow spread COVID” (including especially masks) allowed schools, businesses, entertainments reopen limited capacity first two three weeks lockdowns, would much higher rate compliance COVID wouldn’t spread fast far did. 

Instead, bunch people believe “virus gonna virus”, they’ve led believe things stop COVID things personally find difficult comply with, abandon *all* preventive measures, including masks. 

We could kept less effective preventive measures going 2022 high rate compliance. Instead significant numbers people pushing zero compliance beginning last summer. anything? f'ing pandemic. Please start telling hoax bs like that. I'm little torn this. Sure makes sense get people asap get society going again, lets forget young population kept home year save boomers. Boomers first vaccine que, get passports sooner.

So rewards young population this? He’s saying people don’t start flaunting remaining rules remain place. It’s really same; don’t even use AZ far ahead vaccination campaign enough output compensate j&amp;j supply. “May”

Also, Earth “may” obliterated giant asteroid tomorrow can't calculate fatality rate like that, makes sense. makes even less sense compare directly real fatality rate covid. Nah EU countries vaccinating general population AZ vaccination health care workers biontech 

They orders lined biontech 2022 current orders large comparison AZ orders live south africa brazil?

CVT reported occur 5 million people first dose AZ-Oxford COVID-19 vaccine.

Massive CI saying mRNA vaccines may exact problem? German plant supplying extra, that's Biontech facility. Though fill &amp; finish done Pfizer plant iirc. both! Mississippi, Iowa, Arkansas, Texas four come mind. four underreport? people completely right, 500,000 people dying horrible deaths knows many millions longer-term effects impacts *everything* including mental health.

Some people knew bad going get take immediate swift action. Others decided truth sucked they'd act like exist help make things worse everyone else.

So yeah...unironically thing said, never A/B choice time admit that. Explain? literally deal patients day lost medicare benefits social security thinks died. government can't shit right. compare them?

Huh? apart UK, EU. Ok US shove bunch money Pfizer Moderna.

Well, happened state anything it. would anything now? Germany based delivery infos even without J&amp;J AZ afaik. thought to, like Black Friday type first come first serve register site.
But think political. know states re-opening language tied ""available vaccine"". think open technically vaccine available would forced open state. guess forced legally could business lawsuits around it. can't.

That’s pause mistake. complete overreaction real negative cost. 

A much reasonable response would send press release saying tell administer vaccine look particular symptoms particular demographic groups rare serious potential side effect data gathered. lmao people quarantining months now, whether vaccinated not. been?? state, Maine nearly 40% fully vaccinated yet cases skyrocketing last couple weeks. % vaccinated, I'd expect cases plummeting. think probably due college age kids opened vaccination 16+ last week.   research, **which yet peer-reviewed**, drew comparisons 500,000 Covid-19 patients US 34 million people Europe received AstraZeneca vaccine, well background level CVT general population.

Nothing really drawn peer review done. Conspiracy theory: AZ cost, whereas Pfizer profit, monetary incentives demonise AZ vaccine.

He correct strong pro-vax evangelists, force stance onto people fence shot instead accepting ""maybe later"".
I'm guilty charged try little bit softer future arguments.   concerned concern. People aren’t going happy get booster kind. vaccines presented 2 doses youre done. Zero happening. 

We've every eliminated *one* disease, disease inoculations well 1000 years first *zero* animal reservoirs. disease also pass asymptomatically extremely visible signs infection.

How think going find vaccinate every bat, cat, field mouse, mink, pangolin, etc? course, that's assuming get humans first place, certainly happening anytime soon. 

Where get idea possible, countries *temporarily* done continue mitigations reimposed can't keep out? I’m pretty big proponent removing restrictions every adult wants vaccine chance fully vaccinated. it’s going take time happens. assume within 3 weeks vaccine opening adults adults want first dose first dose, takes 5 weeks date first dose you’re 2 weeks past second dose, puts 8 weeks past April 19th, June 14th. think that’s good date drop restrictions US. Modernas April 19th shipment delayed April 29th, one CTV reporter saying delayed May 3rd..

Come on... frustrating, Pfizer one early delays seems figured out. Lol know situation bud. live 500sqft apartment sound carries pretty easily. supposed get decent cardio? yeah new pill makes dick hard wait. California blue print safer economy. used yellow 1 cases per 100k pop. added multiplier (0.5-n) based number tests administer. also changed 2 cases per 100k pop recently. going make green tier instead decided throw blue print June 15th (but keep masks). 

I would recommend &lt; 93 deaths US per day 2-4 weeks. number 2019 flu deaths. moment less deadly flu think vaccines protecting us spike back up, great. 

93 = 0.28 deaths per 1M pop. 
US needs 10x (90%) reduce deaths. 
Israel needs 3x (66%) reduce deaths. 
UK needs 2x (50%) reduce deaths. people get vaccinated (hopefully!) cases/hospitalizations/deaths start REALLY dropping, appetite keep restrictions place basically zero. I'm hopeful occur prior Memorial Day. said, I'll fully vaxxed 5/12 I'm going back normal That's happening.
Whats probably happening is, antibodys specific type blood platelets, causes clot. 🤐🤐
👍 week-iversary tho 😄 forget ones get vaccine heard ""a bunch people died blood clots"", even though one person seven million died.    



Your chances dying much greater without vaccine vaccine + potential complications vaccine. Far much fear mongering right now. Unfortunately many people think drivers license creates two tier society. least US. mean, people think requiring ID vote form discrimination. 

There always people think sort registration proof competency protection form discrimination ~ people ignored. peer reviewed. pretty much ignore thought 6 vaccines? power jab, space jab, reality jab, soul jab, time jab mind jab. you, people willing live rest lives bubble wrap. start ""it's forever, little longer!"", we've literally hearing 13 months now. 

For young healthy people covid never massive risk. 5% previous risk even getting sick, maybe 1% previous risk serious illness death. Good enough! Damn near every patient admitted ER Covid elevated D-dimer labs. I’ve seen since beginning. aced EZPZ 😤 Oh good it’s 1/8th likely thing basically shut countries avoid, surely go get it.

I’m anti vaxxer earth good argument? mean, gonna need boosters, won’t mean whole round vaccinations even ones we’re aren’t over? less people need booster shots?

Because boosters, feels like pandemic never going end. think Aunt's took like 24 hours. Really slow reason. appointment? 

If see anything tomorrow, would call confirm. That's probably still lower chances catching covid getting blood clot that. .. looks like good argument avoid getting COVID, avoid getting vaccine. 🤷‍♂️ vaccine reactions worse 2nd dose, expect 3rd even worse 2nd? beat “disease” distance mask, would even consider vaccine? Looking this, getting vaccine seems best odds. Yeah heard Pfizer Moderns tests infections still ramping up, AZ J&amp;J tested later, lot cases overall. There's good chance skewed results. getting vaccine still would not, understand vaccines infallible. understand first point distills “well simply won’t catch covid”, hasn’t worked well far becomes harder harder people adopt viewpoint you’re moving trying catch space year trying catch rest life. news originally broke ""6 young women"" there've 9 cases looked including 1 vaccinated young man, 1 placebo young woman, 59yo woman. 1 young woman birth control well, since lot people curious correlation. Oxford working hard lose little credibility left first 2 days ago. felt tired, soreness upper arm shoulder, mild chills. came 6-8 hours shot gone 24 hours got shot. young child. Luckily grandparents gotten vaccinated, refused would said want see grandchild need vaccinated first.

I'm probably overly cautious overly protective. decision ultimately you. son probably fine even exposed. Key word probably. I'm willing accept child probably ok someone anti-vax/vaccine-hesitant. England hotel quarantine well. make3me fucking angry locking healthy people guard make pay it. human rights lawyers??

But quarantine Netherlands hotels. Now, recommended self isolate travel, 15 May could mandatory. sure that, reinfections rare seems natural immunity better immunity vaccine. still vaccinated though, people infected vaccinated. Yes yes that's good all, get wrong, 100% pro vax, feel better getting something cause clots all? get argument, getting AZ vaccine still better choice getting nothing, absoulutely reasonable people prefer vaccines it. good know people like you. good recommend people higher risk group.

It's necessary stop use everyone. I'm curious know second shot goes? Covid January got first Moderna shot couple weeks ago. bad chills couple days, worse Covid (but least Covid symptoms deal with). rest life. even claim this. COVID's around year. compare risk catching COVID AZ vaccine. starts make sense people hesitant wanted stress difference rural urban, really made two maps. One urban counties one rural counties. true. Especially pandemic seems winding places like US UK, chances actually catching covid lower. Germany mostly vaccinating second priority group right (16 million people, group 1 7 million). includes lot different jobs (teachers/police), people certain health related risk factors, people older 70 cases contacts people (partners pregnant women, carers old people on).

Some states opened AZ everyone 60 make sure enough demand get rid delieveries. 

Group 3 (~12 million people) start soon-ish, includes people older 65 whole lot people risk. valid point long you’d willing interact others could get different kind shot. shouldn’t include social distancing, wearing mask etc still going out. opportunity get vaccinated choose don’t believe right increase risk people regardless precautions.  similar question several weeks ago I'll paste best response got. main issue Moderna elicited CD4+ cells CD8+ cells (whereas Pfizer elicited both). looks like matter jury still long run. induction antispike nAbs key component effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, well known cells, particularly TFH cells, critical generate antibody-producing plasma cells long-lived memory B cells. patients COVID-19, high nAb titers correlated strong CD4+ T cell responses, lack functional TFH cells reacting SARS-CoV-2 shown detrimental... final issue consider whether high quantities vaccine-induced CD8+ T cells local sites need elicited future vaccine candidates. initial group vaccines clinical trials primarily focused generating effective nAb response provides recipients long-standing protection, may necessary invest efforts. However, problems emerge vaccinated population breakthrough infections, waning antibody levels vaccination, and/or emergence new viral strains, would wise reconsider vaccine approaches specifically designed induce functional CD8+ TRM responses upper respiratory tract."" if, hear out, don’t like idea either. I’m pro vax got moderna. Pfizer’s clinical trial showed 82% efficacy 1 shot, able obtain data 21 day period doses. haven’t seen study examining efficacy single dose longer periods time, probably far J&amp;J ""Days weeks"" 
From Anthony Fauci, nation's top infectious disease expert, says the* [*recommended *on Johnson &amp; Johnson Covid-19 vaccine that: pause -- cancellation -- likely last days weeks.""I doubt seriously we're talking weeks months,"" told CNN Wednesday.* turn tables! Overall chances either still super low. Comparable risk dying non-natural cause next week comparison), riding motor cycle work. simply _living life_ week. Heck, surprised stressed potential side effects vaccine deadly.

There always _some_ risk. Yes, avoid high risk situations, can't live life avoiding _all_ risk. vaccine low risk, reward getting (and everyone else's) freedom back. argument I've heard might hold water follows:

Equipment involved things like MRNA manufacturing processes much supply constrained. opened patents would scramble purchase equipment cause costs rise slow distribution different groups competed/stole equipment needed. would increase costs cause difficulties. therefore efficient centralise single production line crisis like this. 

Not sure holds water (how supply constrained precursor parts?). made sense case. example trolly problem. disallowing use J&amp;J allowing great numbers people killed sickened inaction rather cause injury less 1 million active measures. Awesome response completely agree you. actually laid groundwork handled. every adult get vaccine talking opening up?  That's wild different everyone! Guess I'll see happens second dose. friend mine week ahead maybe I'll test vicariously preview... mean, I'm sure dont help. randomly got tinnitus last fall, likely due stuffy nose/allergies, ever since. notice much anymore, also place currently live lot white noise heater nearby, I'm worried go back home silence make bother more. Well idea get least 85% population enough hosts virus keep spreading thus dies out. Even get infected recover still level resistance immunity time, necessarily everyone vaccinated. still people could catch it, idea come contact someone else thus recover longer able spread chain infections dies off. Even people using masks help even coming contact guarantee virus spreading new host.

I agree however seemingly unlikely outcome, particularly various mutations increasingly contagious making harder prevent spread. upside respect generally speaking viruses grow increasingly resilient contagious often becoming less deadly time. viruses deadly disable kill hosts spread works eventually can't survive without host. say necessary happening would eventually happen Covid possible.

I definitely agree sentiment likely Covid becomes recurring ""seasonal"" virus akin flu requires regular shots keep resistance variants never truly killed off.

In regards younger children getting vaccine currently understanding main reason combination lower risk serious conditions actually catching covid combined simply enough data potential side effects vaccine age groups. initial test groups include younger age groups thus largely believed vaccines would safe we're waiting testing ensure this. Meanwhile makes sense focus available doses risk groups age groups trials previously. stupid. leaders need vaccinated. Idk guess? 😒 ""variant booster"" - improve protection current possible future variants. past year half I've wondering done yet sure matters say today since change minds say something else tomorrow.

Next year they'll deal whatever next year brings. Wait covid past? Sadly nothing new. Fuck satanic president Yeah hormonal BC lot side effects, use shit either. start announcing anti-vax, sound anti-vax. where'd pull 1/10 infection rate ? Lol, load BS 😂 Absolutely exhausted since happens get flu shot too, unexpected. fatigue, feel totally fine. you? case, risk catching COVID would 1/8; tell total infection rate USA 1/10

You easily see method fails practice. example, risk measles low. one vaccinated vaccines risk according simplistic method. 

Epidemiology 101, must know contagious disease order assess risk. Measles, actually incredibly contagious R value 12-18. Covid R value around 4, matter time 1/10 4/10 10/10. 

The math gets even complicated. Pfizer Moderna supplying approximately 23 million vaccine doses per month US vs 7 million J&amp;J. wait week two get safer effective vaccine. think point best action would see possibility licensing production Pfizer Moderna vaccines pharmas - clearly winner. Um, yeah... interact someone anti-science, make *you* anti-science somehow? describe mechanism me....

Ahh okay, know preservative. curious. 

These people always ones want tracked elite, watched videos learned conspiracies google account, via GPS logged smart device. crack up. 66 million people fully vaccinated 2 weeks ago.

But reduce low-level endemic disease, keep vaccines easily available, knowledge capacity effectively treat it, we'll fine. get vaccines let sort mandatory mask wearing majority vaccinated it’s worth wearing masks public spaces invest MRNA vaccines whatever virus trying mitigate. **New York State** first dose shots:

Not real sure population numbers best. likely daily posts NYS people asked started tracking numbers 7 days ago, finally data US Catholics avoiding J&amp;J vaccine due statement Bishops use abortion-derived cell lines. 48.3% adults one shot, means 3 weeks nearly half adults fully vaccinated. they’re starting open even more. Places Texas starting say appointment necessary, place interviewed mentioned they’ll vaccines site employees. That’s we’ll get another 10-20% adults, people take can’t bothered make appointment, take day etc. Meh think covid really causing anything. PCR diagnostic test unisolated primer. doubt heavy mask wearing bad medical care causing clots nearly many experimental ejection. 

&amp;#x200B;

\*I participating ""vaccine"" experiment. I'm part control group. No, rational wait mNRA vaccine. 

Lets put way: COVID 8-times likely cause rare brain clotting; however:

a) alternatives (Pfizer, Moderna; 

b) get J&amp;J vaccine, example, 100% chance getting vaccine; less risk getting clots COVID would need smaller 12.5% chance getting COVID extra waiting time get J&amp;J different vaccine. 

For wife, demographic risk J&amp;J, shows vaccine appointment next week J&amp;J, rational make new appointment somewhere else week get mRNA vaccine instead. works home, I'm vaccinated likely give COVID her, gone entire time without getting COVID. There's little risk catching one extra week, would get safer, effective vaccine. Yes exactly, almost countries invested billions dollars development production vaccine use citizens first. certainly makes sense /s. walked past kid older 5 parent getting vaccinated yesterday pointed bandaid said ""she got it"" singsong voice went past, almost sounded jealous. kid kinda made day lol, parents probably raising good kid. Sorry hear that. likely end going majority places though Sanofi, Delpharm.

They'll bottling / control / shipping. allowed fb morons talk it. really doubt it. Lies, hate misinformation anything new. existed pre-Internet days form urban legends old wives tales among things similarly widespread. spread fast. would take months years lie spread, takes seconds minutes. majority states, are, plus don’t see would prevent positive PR campaign starting However many pharma companies get away $ guys wearing masks outside? Aside ethos letting people take 1 million chance adverse side effects.. 1 7 million died. think logical point view, that's actually really good probability knowing people extremely fragile, there's people allergic sunlight water god's sake.

The real rationale people see 3 million people died virus many suffering extreme adverse effects it. Even vaccine caused breakout pimples that's 1 10000 still huge hesitancy.

Just blows mind risk unaverse people be. 1. E484Q extremely similar E484K

2. L452R doesnt confer major resistance, it’s minor. It’s like N501Y

3. Im pretty sure Moderna Pfizer testing whether third dose existing vaccines works got 2nd one last Sunday. Chills, tired, sore arm, headache next day. besides sore arm lasted 48 hours, 24 hours shot less back normal. worded better said 6 weeks. meant 6 weeks 1st fully vaccinated, 2 weeks 2nd. 30 year old male Covid worried brain blood clots? Lol mandate gone mean lots people still wearing masks, private businesses still requiring masks. 

Likewise, state institutes mandate, mean suddenly everyone wearing mask 100% time. threat? No. I'm somewhat liberal, saying conservative areas conservative people already divided us, instituting domestic vaccine passports already sketchy, certainly help us come together. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Well issues begining state long waits. they've gotten much better. everyone eligible yet. Fair enough, vaccines even causing blood clots classicly ""peer-reviewed"" yet either, preemptively paused administration abundance caution study it.

So that's stance, talking vaccines causing blood clots all. there's large volume people getting particular vaccine bottle neck affect, people wait lines such, competent adults charge vaccine rollout moving along *way* efficiently quick thing people. 

But yeah, experience covid vaccine also 20 mins. vaccine available places providers great job scheduling appointments people know exactly there. thank this, really appreciate it.

Lower efficacy hospitalizations regular symptomatic Covid-19 seems odd, guess summarize mRna good preventing infection, vaccinated people get infected moderately good preventing hospitalization.

These seems contradict earlier reports somewhere 95-100% hospitalization. Although guess 55 100 95% confidence interval still large. Civil War? Haha. going threat can’t get way? “Of course that’s CDC recommends... I’m starting check don’t protect people around anymore” 

This people said year ago masks “99% survival” rate. You, us, idea variants come people continuing shrug CDC pleading people follow little longer variants make vaccines useless don’t chance sprout up.


I’m fully vaccinated follow guidelines protect people close me, me, strangers.... again, it’s asked us. 

Saying “well yeah ofc thats sCiEnTiSts say continue _global pandemic_ people don’t care thinking they’re safe masks don’t matter all” 


It’s ridiculous, it’s craziness


If people listen CDC masks become memory instead mandatory don’t they’ve begging people 2 months since major rollouts stop thinking like still follow guidelines _everyones’_ safety. 


All things posted like

Craziness- it’s year, listen science can’t people listen science create safer environment sake creating safest environment Thank much words encouragement! kind say :) OCD big hurdle, focusing vaccines good advice absolutely helps. truly amazing. like people tell things like ""you consciously breathing"" ""you feeling tongue inside mouth."" Like god damn let passive bodily functions stay passive. Masking one variable, guarantee (N95 filters 95% particles); ventilation distancing, plus vial load exposure, big ones.

So vaccinated area great ventilation - like outside - fine without mask (once laws relax). expect masked flights airports areas indoors poor ventilation quite time. tell whatever want hear.  it, Reddit! many fun infographics masks work, like, 10 doctors made YouTube videos running marathons mask, much less vaccines? Maybe it’s social media bubble, seeing lot less campaigning vaccine awareness, seems wrong seeing real-world evidence effect size vaccines significantly greater masks

We’re going hit wall vaccine demand petty soonish US big vaccine positivity campaign would useful thing started, like, yesterday Stop trying make Astrazenica happen. going happen. time sometimes is

No... no, isn't. textbook Dunning-Kruger effect.

It's good thing experts public health policy sociology making decisions alongside technical experts. wait get another vaccine? Call 4 weeks. Chance getting covid inside 4 weeks 100% 1%, way less. get vaccine go back normal. There's NEJM paper already mentioned, there's also preprint done Pfizer Israel Ministry Health comprehensive data (based 3.3M fully vaccinated peg efficacy preventing severe disease 96% efficacy preventing death 93%. face it, seems weird death lower efficacy severe disease, observational study (for whatever reason) seems like vaccinated people infected likely die unvaccinated people infected. Perhaps portion people vaccine work tend frail risk? Figures library full top hygiene theater don’t see things turn around quickly.   may use different vector. vector immunity wanes time supposed slow period J&amp;J deliveries around anyways, think, previous production issues. Seems like sort lined timing wise. Hopefully give go-ahead ready go again. people get vaxxed legitimate reasons doctor agrees

Go grocery store, vaccination, ends reddit lives destroy employers called.


Liberal best evil, least Republicans hateful transparent. article nothing shutdowns. They're discussing possibility additional shots may needed maintain herd immunity trying build. anything, *prevent* shutdowns.

And different getting annual flu shot? What's big deal here? We've trying eradicate polio decades, vaccine much easier store administer far cheaper.

I agree general point, rule cheaper, easier store easier administer COVID vaccines coming online next years. Yes, two made sense sure doesn’t. 
Only certain stores opened packed others not. 
Sports good resume, casinos open, countless examples politicians breaking unconstitutional rules. list goes on. 
And sudden cloth mask good n95 respiratory particles. go I’ve done well community live in. 
I problem want take precautions want themselves. 
Never “protect others” thing ever used shame many people  Stay hydrated! took gallon water get first day. we're refusing investigate further, we've established meaningful information need make informed decision.

The viable alternative delaying covid vaccination vaccine fairly inconsequential risk. risks associated action too, way, vaccine taker might unwittingly spread virus to, especially peoples whos ability successfully isolate getting restricted, wellbeing people stuck isolating longer vaccine rollout delayed people particular vaccine. 

We ignoring additional risk factor sake keeping conversation simple, want start prodding 'refusing investigate further' going see argument become less less viable.

Increasing chances dying year 0.8% 0.8005% something would consider big deal.

But that, entire argument flawed. relies idea path risk inherently stupid take. Getting dog increases chances hurt dog. Swimming pool increases chances drowning. Owning kitchen knife increases chance knife related injuries. risks could avoided simply taking action associated risk, make stupid go swim want prepare food. Yeah much longer know it. little victories worth celebrating. Congrats yours! :) We're path overcoming anxiety, one step time. get 2x per year? boosters, needed, would single shot.  Airfinity british company. Checked linkedin, none employers, founders people involved chinese. 

How fact OP posts China related subs explain numbers? Definitely better let someone want catch COVID get vaccinated instead, wait another carrot beyond added. catch COVID time extra immunity vaccination part protect community. it’s literally life death

Is it? lots people hereditary clotting disorders - like 3 8 percent Europeans Faktor V Leiden Mutation. far increased risk taking AZ found people. doubt unless flu shot also mRNA vaccine. mRNA-lipidnanoparticle stability low surprised adding additional components reduces stability. Hope recovers. grandma, vaccinated first dose Sinovac/Coronavac, COVID oxygen time.

My grandpa, took first dose AstraZeneca, infected.  
(She got first dose Sinovac 16 March, got first dose AZ 3 March, infected Late March/early April)  describing 100% effectiveness, phenomenon known herd immunity. Israel reached point high level immunity within population 1 case Covid average spread less 1 new person. US 1 case Covid average spread 1 new person. rate spread known basic reproduction number also called R0. Israel R0 less 1, US R0 1. bring R0 1 high rates vaccination, get back normal life. correct, we're piggybacking EUs big contracts. able negotiate better deal anyway. Okay! hopefully wouldn’t complications someone vaccinated J&amp;J vaccine got mRNA booster shot? would great news true Sorry red shirts. wonder even small inducements could encourage it.

I think allocated something north $200 million public-facing campaigns target vaccine hesitant demand dies down, but...

I wonder would better use $200 million print 40,000,000 $5 gift cards, get pharmacies &amp; retailers gift-card-match make $10 getting vaccination. Dunno why. Government officials much vital operation country. ones country can't really afford get sick. 

Also sets powerful image safety vaccines leader gets others. 90% effectiveness, 1 10 shot still susceptible infection

Sounds great me. would say that's great protecting me, poor. looked up, R0 seems describe infection rates. question pertains individual amount virus body lower viral load. happens *that* individual actual physical material virus inside *them*? Probably call CVS ask go soon then. New Hampshire boarder controls.

Israel, them. People infected previously covid strong reactions first dose none second dose. I'm assuming people strong reaction second dose wont bad reaction third dose. Lol wow piece work 😂 efficacy means half country vaccinated 100,000 daily cases, 10,000 would vaccinated people. So, yes still risk virus widely circulating.

But correct say poor protecting it. pretty damn good. OCD worst, depression. I'm sorry dealing now, hope things get better soon. got this!  Hey! Another J&amp;J vaxed person clinical anxiety disorder! thought alone! Lol. We’ll get man, you’re right, they’d account 7 million people would position. hope wouldn’t wait longer something whatever reason Honestly refreshing see states high vaccine acceptance ending mandations. might good people concerned they've lost ""freedom"" forever see. However, I'm sure timing right variants much unknown there. I'm sure many businesses still mandates. meant media, apologies clear think depends much news organizations see people still interested topic not. Fear anxiety potent drugs drive viewership. public keeps giving attention, supply news keep talking it. 650mg Tylenol every 6 hours, 500mg every 4 hours. Feel free message questions. never New Hampshire.

The fact they've mandate lasted long miraculous. even require seat belts. I’m close alcohol poisoning anyhow terrible everything going here, need Bizarre downvote. Michigan's 7-day rolling average still rising, though may near flat. calculated crude death rate one agencies reporting deaths age incidence age mortality rate may hinge definition young. counting people 18 49.

Also presumes know incident rate requires lot testing. Germany appears sufficient testing probably slightly skewed really fucking annoys many answers *only* comparing blood clot (or rather CVT / ""brain clots"") risk Covid AZ/vaccines.

Instead mortality / side effects / long term effects (off both) general.

Yes, AZ might higher risk CVTs Pfizer/Biontech, yes, might ""only n times less risk Covid"" – Covid cause death / hospitalization / long term lung neural damage / ""Long Covid"" / watever ADDITION blood clots / CVTs. yep, even ""the young healthy"" (although lower probability elderly / groups risk – still quite bit).

Sounds really fucking short-sighted thinking me.

Yeah, might best everyone would get ""the good vaccine"", everyone (ask Europe even better, ask ""poorer countries) really cases even ""the bad one"" sooner still much better getting Covid dying blood clots many ways kill – suffering long term effects.

On top that: Getting vaccinated sooner protect individual sorry corpse, also protects others reducing potential spread (and mutations) course protecting cannot get vaccinated whose immune system cannot build effective immune response vaccine (""vaccine non responders"" term, iirc.).

What I'm saying is: no, ""AZ clots vs Covid clots vs Biontech clots"". year since they've immunized? News me. Aos, 76, Monsignor Alberto Lorenzelli, auxiliary bishop Santiago, confirmed church tested positive COVID-19 earlier received two doses Sinovac vaccine administered Chilean health authorities, church said, second dose administered March 11. read article linked corona sub said somewhere 6-12 months, possibly, maybe, likely. get confusion. Probably forgot probability total events denominator, counting favourable events (clotting) covid vs vaccine cases. Smh. don’t see connection hospitalizations rising needing masks anymore?

With less 25% state’s population fully vaccinated? many people live work Massachusetts?

It masks terrible burden.

Revoking mask mandate make harder small businesses protect employees.

My hair stylist pregnant. She’s double-masking customers mask. She’s lost lot business due pandemic. lose continues require people mask state mandate gone? small mom pop stores, one employee gets sick, whole family might?

We still definitive findings whether vaccinated people transmit virus not. key factor calculations.

I think waiting one month, vaccinations warmer weather, makes sense.  list beyond crap. makes absolutely sense.

15 million jabs given Russia alone. Russia import vaccines exported good amount. Plus storage. Yet even appear graph, UK, 18 million, there.

Are chinese vaccines produced license Brazil counted China? so, AZ vaccines produced India license counted India? People still wear masks outside? article read said somewhere 6-12 month, again, lots likely maybe possibly. data far, including today's CDC publication shows beating even odds.

Unless really wild variant arises soon, believe vaccination campaign natural immunity get close burn out. wearing mask endangers others NOW.

But we've lived generations without mandatory masking facilitating there's segment community seems bound determined make mandatory masking persist science public health called that... Okay. make sure viral illness season. don’t leave house wear mask gloves go essential stores-like target! Oh sports okay tho! movies! important!!
Also, make sure u never speed forget use blinker, wash hands touching anything, heck never know- wear mask way lol. virus bad need test know u even lol. Yeah, places outdoor mask mandates. There's little evidence suggest amount significant spread outdoors except maybe densely packed areas. Exactly! sad people think suffering women others blood clot issues die vaccine others really like 'it's low, need take risk greater good'. one seems care them. sad. People seem compassion suffering, many want force others go 'for greater good'. really sad.  friend got hers, I'm getting mine Saturday next one within month later. joke. Someone knows next ICU struggling stay alive speak. (only 26 healthy) taken shots, could her. 


Abbot's ignorant ass partly blame, also personal responsibility needs come consideration. said, joke Bring back J&amp;J vaccines then. interesting tristate multi-state regions too. one state drops mandates, others follow suit everyone cross state lines eat dinner go out. like drinking age stuff like that.  Pretty sure booster shots mRNA regardless, since that's easy convert production on. right saying looks like year's Christmas gonna bad last years, Europe? getting worse worse, vaccines enough. Breaking news, pausing covid infections due risk clotting death. certain point, decisions consequences responsibility infectious disease spread almost always shared responsibility.

I think person keeps end bargain: gets vaccinated, abides local guidance spread reduction, etc, ultimately responsibility covered. point recipients keep end societal bargain. right decide put health God's hands. Hopefully sustain them. Meanwhile Europe, leaders still “urging patience” prepping ground yet another lockdown yep US prep act basically got rid lawsuits. Yes fund, prep act fund basically never pays. regular vaccine fund pay. retailers mask mandates?

In Virginia, statewide mandate, left individual businesses. think there's two separate issues. One antibody levels drop exposed virus while, virus continuing mutate immunity old versions might protect much newer version. 


In words, long-lasting immune response wrong thing. think it’s actually closer 30% US forgetting there’s vaccine thats 95% effective 100% effective preventing severe cases?

Yeah 20% state fully vaccinated. see can't wait another month, point every single person offered first dose, majority received 2 doses. ""Narrative""? considered study vaccines definitely certain.

A booster would 2 shot regimen, US distributing flu vaccines decades probably problem. Whether people take probably another story. weird problem. one hand, it'd probably save human lives gave vaccine hesitant sent excess supply countries able vaccinate high risk elderly populations. hand, sure would nice get herd immunity go back January-February 2020 Covid something could fuck us ""over there"".

As American, I'm glad problem folks developing world grappling with. want anyone else dying either. people vulnerable situations, paint good public picture put ahead them.

(She's head state, btw - head government). wear helmet driving car? EUA approved pretty close final approval. reason EUA option went steps required., 

But go ahead live life way want. God bless you, family, people come contact with. J&amp;J last week I'm you, lots similar ""what ifs"" floating around head even though I'm group experienced side effects (I also clinical anxiety issues, played super well that). Rationally, think we'll forgotten though, keeping everyone safe covid everyone's best interests long-term.

(EDIT: grammar) disagree. still exposure real world pandemic higher level. Meaning individual trial likely exposed possibly higher initial viral load. tested circumstances. discussing number infections. Also, read FDA document J&amp;J enrolled roughly 40k participants (20k vaccine 20k placebo) measured relative differences. stop counting 300 mean one people get? Damn studies fast. think severity underlying health conditions. active cancer patient vaccinated, still might get severe case one break cases.

If moderately healthy person guess won’t severe breakthrough cases. Huh? would think Moderna safer? won’t see partner answer questions didn’t get shot urgent care. doesn’t insurance money. rechecked temp it’s I’m going monitor now. Yeah, social distancing.

This way say city still rule place everyone knows don't. 2nd Moderna yesterday 9:45AM. Sore arm early morning, big time nausea, fever (was hovering 103s 104.2F, coming body aches better. 4 hours bad though really bad flu. 


If neighbors reddit, apologize. 52 day exercise streak going made end street vomiting bushes. love traditional means “since 2019”. Like wildfire... First all, never said anything call it, did. said thank Pfizer manufacturing logistics, directly relates article. majority production done Pfizer huge pharmaceutical company, that's they're good at. regards Trump, I'm going defend anything fool did. regards name, everyone calls Pfizer vaccine, I'm sorry tell you.

That's exactly helpful companies quarterly profit goals objectives surpass. Yes. done delivery. Bring fuck-me-up-with-meat pizza, 2-liter, dose Pfizer 45-minutes less.


Then three weeks. likely, hopefully, lower better therapeutics treatments. according February 4, looks like would going BLA, according FDA took median 8 months priority applications 2016. remember seeing news article Pfizer saying would take 6 months.  Except spreads animal populations zoonotic virus vaccinate animals happen. Probably gonna like flu. riskier proposition 30s prevalence covid community low (I.e. low likelihood catching covid first place). Thr balance shifts way likelihood catching covid higher.

Cases pretty much irrelevant though, it’s merely dependent much test. looking mortality rate past 7-days, lowest since October. Glad y’all okay. I’m interested hear fully vaccinated people prolonged exposure someone infectious.  thing vaccine. vaccine free still bill insurance administration.

To absolutely clear, bill cost associated vaccine even insurance. saying still going play typical bullshit games. restriction isnt capacity that's all. 

Capacity doesnt mean amount customers serve given time. literally means legal limit maximum number people fire department says room poses large fire danger. includes employees patrons, eating well physically there. 

Imagine road speed limit 80 car go 40. told removed speed limit would argue really changed car cant go fast? No. understand thing limiting feok going 100 car, car speed limit. free product would people free nothing else healthcare free? natural response awful system. oh surprise another example women taking initiative try healthy men much that's it. He's antivaxxer. 50 year old free rider re: herd immunity (definition below). know convince see selfish people. 

Vaccination may discouraged incentive “free-ride”. Referred herein “free-riders” vaccination, individuals avoid cost associated vaccination benefiting individuals' vaccination.

PS GLAD DAD CAME AROUND!!! trials symptom onset curves diverged almost entirely day 11, implying protection infection days earlier. Yea prob! That’s big issue. Wish answer think got basics right. rephrased part spike protein conformations. AstraZeneca chimpanzee adenovirus surface proteins + genetic sequence sars2 spike protein. immune response triggered antigens. ALso far know Astrazeneca use proline method like BioNtech makes spike stable conformation cause spike adopt prefusion-stabilized conformation reducing membrane fusion ability, increasing expression stimulating neutralizing antibodies. results targeted immune response less side effects. I'm proably spitting facts assume reason increased efficacy mRNA vaccines oppsed viral vectors. Never really saw anyone (Checks make sure I’m /r/covid19, anecdotal discussion bannable)

About two months ago, aunt uncle got sick fully vaccinated one mRNA vaccines, spread several unvaccinated family members turn. Aunt uncle 80s major health issues, since central NC currently experiencing vaccine-breaking surge new variant, I’m guessing immune systems aren’t working full capacity.

Luckily mild course them, family members also recovered, although one go hospital couple times. Without vaccine, I’m pretty sure would death sentence aunt uncle given health issues age. Per vaccines research probably wait 12 weeks. probably data boosters eventually. another anti-worm drug lot people screaming rooftops about, relegated lunatic fringe. almost turned extra one Walgreens pharmacist asked insurance card. said never-mind don’t insurance first time heard free. either masks, shutdowns kids. 

You correct stats state children less susceptible covid adults. one needs realize looking stats children vs. Adults compare generally percent 100k population children vs. adults compare children children, adults adults. Otherwise groups become skewed comparison children counts humans 0-18 Adults counts every human 18 yo.

That said, yes children less susceptible. However need begin expect plan effects vaccine adults, lessening restrictions general effects spread, expected rise cases among children, etc.

We need try assess difference masks social distancing thus far spread covid among children without them.

Data suggests course higher possibly counter acted vaccinated adults, extent.

I hope low vaccines continue rollouts expand.

Data drive approaches covid watch children case count react accordingly. What's supposed mean? problem YOUNG women.  “.... study finds” — that’s rather important part headline leave out! mean, yes no. vaccine free, someone still paid administer it. understand it, whole vaccination process free bill insurance. Every doctor knows treat blood clottings, easy. said news ""don't take prophylaxis, worth it"", reason, doctor's first idea. believe actually briefly (?) required another department work. (Either that, literally 20+ people started double masking one day haven’t stopped...) Nothing free! think strains contagious virulent (especially younger people) make round two though unvaccinated population magically people want shots.

Is possible suffer one thousands diseases still exist? trying argue either, trying explain initial comment might rub people wrong way. I'm US too, totally get saying getting two vaccines pulled would totally tanked lot people's trust, probably best AZ rolled US.

but yeah, saying understand study published relevant relevant (since access better vaccines) going rub wrong way. like someone made video showing drop test expensive phone cheaper phone cheaper one survives drop better someone comes along saying ""but get $400 case goes expensive phone survives drops better cheap phone cheap case, dont see dropping phones without case relevant, expensive one performs much better anyway"", that's also obviously gonna rub people wrong way.

Almost many people died diarrhoea following pfizer jab brain clots AZ... doctor uses unfractionated heparin prophylaxis? here, also sis law 40s. Full vaccin Pfizer. Nephew brought home covid. Still got symptomatic covid, bad.

What people seem forgot covid infection still fuck life good 2 weeks vaccinated not. is.. quarantaine, testing, waiting whole family get better, fixing groceries, working etc etc. really wonder price ""non-profit"" vaccine different different buyers (last heard, UK paying three four times much per dose EU).  weird double standard imo. perfectly fine healthy young adults Germany took wanted contribute community exchange died, can't really risk management here. people would perfeclty fine standard covid safety guidelines.

I'm glad really really envious AZ worked UK man knowing know ca understand people take risk.

That's I'm glad core gorup people blood clots treated AZ anymore. people serious symptoms? think study showed 90% infection protection 95% disease prevention. Letting virus circulate mutate

its main reason vaccines given children far. 
they currently testing. approve children safer COVID flu, thats another topic.

the long COVID asthma fear unreasonable. California 12% US population cases going currently flat... probably didn’t believe you/assumed mistaken. saying magically disappear, saying think go back complete normal, maybe still wearing masks, even covid cases around 75% fully vaxxed.risk health system overrun basically 0 point How? kind interesting discourse tended move around past 18 months so. Pre-pandemic, anybody expressed concerns vaccine safety -- example suggested changes vaccination schedules explanation changes population prevalence certain illnesses -- branded conspiracy theorist 'anti-vaxxer' (people like Robert Kennedy Jr.). people become engaged issue, discourse changed without anybody really acknowledging it, 'vaccines completely safe anybody disagrees antivaxxer' '*of course* vaccines entail risks -- medicines do', prior animus people expressed concerns even population-level vaccine ill-effects transferred people improperly perceiving degrees *individual* risk. 

I axe grind that, interesting change. found last week friend got it. need spread word!  went scavenging reddit evening horrified many people would read article like think ""See?! vaccine work all!"" We're seeing infection rate like 0.008% fully vaccinated population . vaccine brought people, number going keep getting lower. guess that’s entirely known, listened Yale professor say “essentially, yes” question. virus wont magically disappear day hit 75%. starr go down, reaches low level.

So, vaccinations take little time cases drop. dropping already, still take time lot goes overboard, think extensive criticism media lately understandable. weeks ago lot insistence media outlets like CNN big fourth wave coming US specifically states opened quickly never science-based didn’t pan all. articles variants would make things much worse US February March cases deaths instead drop dramatically. 

So basically things often aren’t bad (in US, many redditors like Americans) media often predicted largely vaccines. However, also wall-to-wall coverage extremely rare vaccine side effect articles don’t put risk perspective well reason concerned serious problem vaccine hesitancy going get worse. 

We also keep mind people extremely tired pandemic may becoming less open new perspectives time settle brains. valid opinions tend come overly hostile instead source good discussion. Nearly 2.2% population? takes month. Source: masters adaptive coaching habituation.  worried kids yourself? 
because COVID nothing kids. reason scared sake all. many countries stopped AstraZeneca vaccine people certain age, mostly 60 years. Since countries start elderly population work down, doesn’t big impact moment young people won’t get vaccinated June July earliest. didn’t end giving info treated like uninsured person billed government. Doesn’t really matter, although think we’d like see cost come big insurance companies pockets rather tax dollars. Yes, older people mostly vaccinated Brazil yeah we’d use i’d take either well.but think much higher numbers people would unwilling reluctant take vaccines options available.some countries europe half people don’t even want AZ shot much fiasco that’s  gets worse.

Vaccine raw materials manufacturing subcontracted.

Corporations also profit advance payments.

Corporations proceed profit vial delivered.

They held liable damages missing delivery targets.

Profits 2020 - J&amp;J $13B, Pfizer $9B, Sanofi $3B, AstraZeneca $5B - like every single year. Yeah, totally desperately need taxpayer funding bootstrap themselves... seen TONS people walking exercising normal spots covid. Lots bigger people too. it’s like go obese snap fingers. anecdotally, people trying UK even better?? Congrats jab! **UK** doctor...

Wasn't something found Finland Sweden ? Either way article source claim, Danish health authorities are. simply asking information number. mean trigger you. sorry lack proficiency Danish language offended you. Btw, impression Denmark switched English anyway: Cool! 1.1 minutes OK. Got it. get first shot tomorrow won’t get next one 21 28 days later? Why?

AZ safe elderly people, J&amp;J statistically safe. One fatality per million doesnt compare Covid-19 fatality rate.

If AZ J&amp;J had, absolutely everyone would use.

I'd issue taking either vaccin. Seems like something able expedite. vaccine hesitancy around emergency use status. Yeah right. Places like brazil easy. people (the ones wouldn’t wear masks wondered shutdowns happening) refusing ONE THING WOULD END SHIT - get vaccinated. “living fear” little ol’ vaccine? I'm amazed see much harm reduction strategies US.

Some states strict locked months time. government really think people going socialize?

Instead place rules like social distancing, masks requirements, table limit sizes. Governments said ""Just stay home"" closed everything, people went others houses instead masks anything.

""Just stay home"" like telling someone ""stop using heroin wanna get HIV overdose"". run needle exchanges give narcan, we're telling people ""go use heroin, great!"" we're saying ""Heroin bad you, going make decision that's bad health, try make safe possible clean needles narcan""

I’m right I’m relaxing procedure May 1 I'm trying come argumentative, sounds lot like know vaccines, even though effective, actually prevent spread. seems like yet another reason continue put life hold indefinitely.

It's good, enjoy heated passionate discussion.

We know vaccines 95% effective Pfizer Moderna. know people still asymptomatically carry spread. 

We know variants develop evade vaccines. push it?

**No one saying indefinitely.** people hearing that?

The original comment arguing they're emotional gut feeling trumps CDC. CDC rational public health advisor.

Anyone re-opening point public health reasons. Right? Every single public health official consistent that. one public health yelling, ""time end mask mandates"" Texas. There's public health angle thing. We've way death necessary last year lot America prioritized p-word can't talk public health.

That's all. different risk tolerances ideas kind loses think acceptable. 

I personally think easing restrictions 2 months early vaccine needlessly reckless. going continue 10 years fine. know there's pretty good finish line. 65's already almost 80% still rising. know incentive, try optimistic. VITT ever heard term ""density""? know ""virus"" places high ""density"" versus places ""density""?

The question known risk dying COVID compares unknown risk dying blood clots caused vaccine. No, can’t know exactly risk vaccine is, estimate based currently know, ask much worse would order justify stopping J&amp;J vaccinations. 

There perfect choices risk management. You’re always working imperfect information. weigh think know versus could possibly be. case, effects J&amp;J vaccine would wildly worse we’re currently seeing risks outweigh benefits. benefits (preventing COVID deaths) known, whereas risks yet unknown.

Neat. Absoloutely agree there, think US made right choice acquired distributing vaccine- getting citizens protected first, lessening burden elsewhere. fair, 3rd highest population country world over, vaccinating fast particularly counterproductive. 


If mRNA vaccines really 90% effective real world (as seems case Israel) herd immunity threshold much lower. US probably country world could globally vaccinate using logistics supply chain expertise, maybe China, mRNA vaccine yet, trials. get population wants vaccinated, could easily see us moving countries mass vaccination gaining back much goodwill towards US lost.

Endangers bit strong. somewhat risky. going story non-essentials risky staying home. going Target ENDANGERING others? 

The political shitfight lead conservatives refuse accept masks fairly easy way reduce risk. also lead liberals believe mask much effective really are. seen person inside public space without mask since probably July, yet city high covid.   leadership looks like. WA definitely winning.   Wow that’s great news. That’s 1 every 19,000 fully vaccinated people. That’s better would expected. Pfizer trial 1 infection every 1875 fully vaccinated people. Probably due trial participants higher risk behavior employment.  Social, yes. Business government wise, no. modern medicine, imagine population correction would occurred conservative counties  kind stupid title. Shutdowns usually come play hospitalizations heading really bad direction.  assume see again, sure. end scenarios hospitals getting capacity, state taking science based approach absolutely consider additional restrictions. Yeah, I’d classify weeks/months worry whether you’ll hook massive bill “burnt.” Even pay full, sure makes never want use insurance unless you’re damn near dead.  Precisely right. honest I’m quite sure, don’t want give medical misinformation, anyone link information Pfizer clinical trial please do, CDC lumps information wouldn’t actually helpful   mostly image reactionism countries. Decisions run media public voting opinion, math science.

Same thing happened nuclear power places like Germany. essentially ended whole nuclear program Fukushima, meant replacing coal gas, turn SINGIFICANTLY increased deaths due carbon pollution. 
But say reacted kind Fukushima safety people... safe kids, closed space classroom, must safe everybody, no? kids vaccinated already??
Let’s ban outside gatherings 6 feet apart, take everything small(class size) interior spaces, 3 feet apart! Much safer according CDC. Also, seen report one person state (TN) clotting complications J&amp;J vaccine state health department says patients TN among 6 clotting complications. leads believe patients complications, similar fact covid clearly spreading US weeks officially acknowledged be. I'm absolutely pro vaccine &amp; 1st moderna dose myself. I'm also absolutely pro pausing J&amp;J study side effects even eliminating necessary vaccinate country safely possible. agree be. Canada's government years ago decided would prioritize pharmaceutical industry let industry leave countries. Even Canada threw several billion dollars pharmaceutical industry beginning pandemic, would enough time build factories, r&amp;d departments, etc needed bring par pfizer. things cannot done quickly take time. dangerous allow critical industry leave country, US also maintains certain industries US. example, circuit fabrication battery factories never fully leave US due national security concerns. Even literally burn money keep industries here, would hand war international disaster occur.

To point building factories everywhere governments everywhere financing current future safety populations. may want check math. ...

...you win round!! “it’s also nod reality: Another round lockdown orders would likely ignored pandemic-weary public.”

*ding!* 

Glad see broadening realization acknowledgement people are, large, done complying, lockdowns restrictions pointless.

Walensky’s suggestion close “go back last spring” asinine laughably touch, especially many at-risk people already vaccinated. people making suggestions would better suggesting all, it’s going turn people whatever wants say. social end pandemic - better get used it.  Well made time think got COVID. Last night little congestion light headache.

7 PM - taste smell completely gone, new cough
Just - temperature 98.7

What going on?

(For record - Last Thursday Monday: negative Covid tests work Unfortunately still places pharmacies charging people it. idea how, it’s quite literally free certain places. government still pushing vaccine lot saying safe (the astra zeneca) yet Denmark saying fuck want it.

Yay! got first one yesterday!! liability anyways, unofficial vaccines used emergency. don’t think they’re liable shit tbh  Thanks, autocorrect murdering me. way phrased lot web sites sign I've seen makes sound like vaccine free administration not. also makes seem free need insurance info. truly free could much simple. agree.

That’s significant can’t refute that! Mainly Pfizer/Biontech. 

J&amp;J 3% April deliveries, AZ paused countries. Florida 7.4% positivity rate ... anything 5% indicates widespread cases. mean it’s cringe, motivates people get vaccinated I’m it. clarification - mean 'to tee'. idea etymology, definitely 'tea'.  took OP's comment mean dying blood clot rather covid literally likely die car accident way vaccine. stress - vaccine life saving keep safe.

And yeah, still multiple tables closed off. nightmare Denver area too. think anyone cooks home here. I've never seen many restaurants busy, even major cities. Oh that's relief hear mostly 60? safe hope then.

Do know particular symptoms look for? I'll Google anyway case know. agree it, makes sense :) Thanks helpful summary. I'm surprised there's many comparisons media contraceptive induced clots people rightly pointing difference clots. seems Covid also cause serious scary sounding CVST even affected healthy young people. side effects second Pfizer dose. First one minor flu like symptoms crazy sore arm 24-48 hours Herd immunity via exposure + virus mutated less lethal strains like influenza [This recent breaks responses categories. Percentages look much better, ""Definitely not"" 13% ""Only required"" 7%. Meanwhile ""Wait see"" category steadily shrinking. genie bottle. social end pandemic here, like not.

I've never waited anything never spent dime parking. won’t taking blood thinners one way street? start can’t stop body adjust thinner blood stopping would suddenly increase pressure increase risk stroke? Canada? Shaming people hesitant experimental unapproved drug given emergency use known health issues cause death, bit reckless no? Sources please?  course real experiment matters actual mass vaccination rollout country, US still seeing 20-30 times number daily cases deaths compared UK (majority vaccinated ONE dose AZ), really wonder effective Pfizer vaccine actually is? would love tell more. generally feel cautiously optimistic post-vaccine life, hard feel certain. Hell yeah! I've walked 300 miles 2021. gym membership. days freezing too. really matter someone fully vaccinated? total scam. US: don’t always make good decisions, solve bad decisions technology, 10,000x cost mistake avoided first place.

Oh well, least money spent going back economy somewhere... sigh. reason continuing pause don’t numbers. Half 7 million J&amp;J shots given week don’t full picture rate yet. Hence waiting make decision see cases happen. apparently takes 6-14 days see clots happen need wait everyone received shot window. San Diegian got dose 2. I’m extremely nervous medical things, got it. 

Beaches beers soon. worried blood clots? condition rare mostly observed women 60 great risk. monitor symptoms couple weeks. also talk concerns doctor. What's hospital bed utilization?  surprising. Death reporting lag weeks months. many deaths reported today likely happened weeks (and further) ago. Fair counter said ""extremely effective"" true statement.

The next response said ""90% effective"" also true statement. 

Not used anyone thread words ""completely"" ""100%"". Nobody ""pretending risk infection."" Basically major counties made available 16+ past days. im 17, getting first dose pfizer tomorrow. id say solid quarter high school gotten first dose parents took 8 weeks ago they’re fine well.

It’s combination, usually get passengers cargo optimal spot issue becomes much weight is. Please let know need explain you’re confused, great question wanna make sure get answer. You’re basing anecdote world’s infamous country handling Covid? Really?

A shitty lockdown better economy lockdown holds true especially look beyond dumpster fire. Canada’s economy responded incredibly positive US. it’s shitty lockdowns, half population actively rebelling sense reason. 

Furthermore regions lockdown massive bias toward blue areas result heavy bis cities several times population dense “open economy” red regions greatly benefited sparse population. 

That’s mention half population actively undermine efforts, much reside outside cities totally undoing efforts made lock down. I’m sure there’s hell lot nuance regardless US still anecdote still example country hardly locked many circumstances measurably worse death toll per capita well significantly worse economic impact rest developed world. 

Thank mature. ""The CDC expects advisers reconsider evidence within two weeks.""  I'm surprised think way. got demand payment ""free"" Covid test lab network. employer said got sorted, imagine people charged good advocacy, they'd avoid seeking testing, treatment prevention. need pandemic.  Heard radio it’s afford low covid numbers. worse shape wouldn’t choice accept AZ vaccine  tests available government hospitals private ones. Government ones testing free. go private route, it'll cost 30 dollars most. Controlled opposition, also covid vaccine far autism idea. 
So much politics behind it.  holding self-imposed isolation 2 weeks second shot, best health.

After though, bets off. crazies UK, France, Italy, Brazil etc, clearly US US-derived Canada really shit job far

Compared who? We're 3rd G20 people vaccinated 3rd G20 total doses shortly.

People whine we're behind UK USA significantly amount capacity manufacture vaccines. concern number vaccinated people increases, test positivity rate? merit vaccinated people getting vaccinated ever-shrinking pool unvaccinated people continues get tested. Dr. Fauci published peer-reviewed answer question respected medical journal, would believe him?

Would even understand it?

Ok, asking? hidden earlier AP/NORC poll mid-February lot people cited generalize ""vaccine noted 15% adults said certain would get vaccinated.

Alternatively contrasting overall adult hesitancy, 7% people 60+ yrs old said certain would get it.

50.7% adults committed getting vaccine (86% unvaccinated 59% combined would... (only) probably get vaccine, probably get vaccine, definitely get vaccine). 13% vaccinated already, including 9% (72% 13%) one shot, 1% 9% = 0.1% planning receive required doses. ~51% adults committed (yet) vaccinated.

Of 51% uncommitted, 35% thought people needed time, 10% concerned cost, 7% recommended doctor (all together 52% cost, doctor, priority, 51% uncommitted). 

So fraction adults committed vaccination included ~26.5% adults waiting doctor, turn, cost. new guidance accounts that, since it'd possibly zero feet kids spread it. 3 ft logical compromise group spread virus risk 6ft lot ask classrooms. People want free. 1 50-55 uninformed know it’s free? .... actually doesn’t seem bad rate-of-ignorance.  r/Guatemala sounds like body reacting normally vaccine. clotting problem, exceptionally rare, show days later, I'm mistaken. mainly affects women. blame US, prefer get mRNA one due issue, even causes slight delay weeks most. People risk tolerances, one can't really argue another's personal risk tolerance.

This really comments went far beyond though.

So specific comment quoted, that's fair criticism make. intent reaction towards how... unsympathetic felt say, *oh well let's give India we, '1st world' get mRNA*. However, considering it, realize people likely saying cost/benefit countries facing much worse infection rates currently would likely make nominal risk worthwhile. Especially may access mRNA vaccines time soon.

I acknowledge likely misinterpreted CDC said J&amp;J ""irresponsibly developed""?

What pointing towards **if** turns knew risk blood clotting would highly irresponsible. could simply moved mRNA full-time.

Still, careful splitting specific issues away basing CDC stop acting like CDC / experts monolithic entity. listened meeting today, plenty experts saying J&amp;J decision disaster. whole resolution meeting making recommendation committee come decision due internal disagreement. clearly members wanted immediately resume certain demographics due relative risks.

Okay sure, think agree putting simple halt responsible move here. clear, albeit small trend. FDA CDC's responsibilities ensure medication vaccinations reach certain standards prior public consumption. Again, vaccinations may reach billions. 1 40,000 relatively close, that's massive loss life. One could avoided altering path forward regard vaccinations.

One thing want make completely clear, pro-vaccination here. polio vaccine though. unique form vaccination uncertainty comes many variables can't always prepare for. (p.20). watch/listen discussion weeks shot got see Godzilla vs Kong IMAX. totally worth it! No, full capacity. Look numbers; states used almost supply they've allocated. Seattle, giant vaccine site stadium's running two days week can't get supply.

Sure, every adult wants vaccine get one next months. that's soon enough. We've got pandemic; speed matters. Math off. Actually 99%, 90%.  Convincing people follow public health measures, however, **is** political thing. 

No turning ""us vs. them"" thing way go convince people follow said measures.

Same deal mom though. phlebotomist. I’d personally venture guess 2, 4, also perhaps cases vaccines took full, major effect (approximately three weeks so). Sounds good, let’s prevent “avoidable” deaths children. born, separated mothers, avoid risk abuse, placed facility 24/7 CCTV monitoring. staff wear hazmat suits, children allowed play padded rooms. receive education training released 18 graduation.

This prevent children dying car crashes, abusive parents maltreatment. oppose it, find children dying preventable deaths acceptable. many need die care?

And yes top straw man, hey comment. going ""end"" sense zero cases, sounds like virus become endemic like common cold flu, far worse consequences immune. really asked wife questionnaire one blood clotting disorders something. think concerned someone might need special attention bleeding risk. get impression related vaccine. vaccines going people would've gotten J&amp;J, would've otherwise gone someone else.

that true... missing.... full capacity... decent supply thanks pfizer... 50 states enough capacity offer vaccines every adult... made appointment yesterday shot saturday....

unless there's massive bottleneck within next two weeks.. everyone wants vaccine get one america without jnj....

the problem.. even big problem... delay runs longer month two three indefinitely.... that's probably going happen unless larger issues... larger issues going want jnj vaccine anyway.... point say ""The vaccine available, want protected go get it."" someone doesn't, they're taking risk, much like motorcycling without helmet.

This absolutely case. opportunity get vaccine decide to, you. exact moment, longer anyone's responsibility protect - made decision, live it. vaccine readily available enough describes 99% people, then... we're done.

There couple major caveats though -

* vaccine actually available. believe Michigan, example, opened eligibility adults like one week ago still really hard get appointment places. plenty people still reasonable opportunity get it.

* lag time ~5 weeks actually immunized (or least 2+ weeks decent protection first dose). reasonable open eligibility everyone immediately go ""k lol vaccine available, pandemic over"" people need bit time get appointment actually become immunized they've received it.

But said done, matter whether reach herd immunity not. 99% American adults chance get immunized, see legitimate argument continue living like this, whether we've reached big 70% 80% whatever. state, seen basically local news clearly stating free, online registration required insurance information zero indication would free. Redditor would thought pay good insurance. still entirely certain way registration was. assumed would covered insurance would particularly surprised copay, even though knew government *supposed* pay it.

He's timid person ever would never lay hand me.(partly bcs knows issue laying flat tried mostly he's kind person.) I'm actually totally fine this. Temporarily. Yup also forced onto people urged get dangerous vaccines higher risk covid complications due age. also new plant Marburg, Germany! Pfizer/Biontech really saving us. Yes, don’t start testing kids we’re incredibly confident safe them. isn’t thing certain.

We’ve given vaccines substantial percentage entire planet’s population, significant issues. We’ve given large studies worth slightly older kids.

Both reasons extremely confident they’ll fine younger kids, that’s they’re studies.

There isn’t magic difference 15 year old 16 year old makes vaccine safe one them. extends line.

If it’s fine study 12 year olds, almost certainly won’t cause problems 10 year olds.

If 14 15 year old, I’d absolutely looking vaccination site wasn’t bothering check IDs, getting kid shot. Massively safer getting covid. Afaik 60% cases Mumbai new double variant seems they're restating clarifying. We've heard much conflicting advice distancing US may also given UK, e.g., studies shown 3' apart ok schools, good reminded essentially nothing changed regarding aerosol Covid. base main vaccine USA applying now?

Moderna behind lol. Yeah, somebody pretty far vaccinated, get idea bad thing. Sure, there's lot stuff can't right now, mad people fundamentally different terms health risk others can? would spiteful.

In addition that, allowing vaccinated people freedom turn allows keep small businesses, bars restaurants afloat rest us enjoy turn. Quite true. seriously could breakthrough level antibiotics variolation.

That’s can’t get degree pessimism instance doesn’t work.

It absolutely let us go back normal, though valid question.

It absolutely blocks almost infection, it’s question tiny percent doesn’t.

Same transmission.

If best vaccine got 70% effective, we’d thrilled. half sub sure miracle won’t job. backwards. 
you test kids make sure really safe kids. germany total 12 kids, ranging 0.9 died. 
out 3mio cases. thats COVID. 

the risk dying adverse effects COVID neglectable vaccination effectively redundant kids.

if makes feel safer better, go it. 
I support peoples informed decisions. wether approve. severity grade definition

What? Source? Oh, thank that's rude mRNA sequence, slightly different delivery mechanisms. And? Pretty incredible considering 1,200 peak I'd suggest reading Albert's Molecular Biology Cell making RNA using RNA make proteins, old edition actually available free. reading actually assign first-year undergrads introductory molecular biology course TA, typically pretty well-received. 

Thank much, that's exactly looking for. STAT News piece seems nice well. Thanks! I'm assuming very. Nothing drives invention better necessity! got Pfizer vaccine pretty cool knowing part history running body. yeah mRNA vaccines biggest breakthrough since mapping human genome, huge advancement itself. India? time though. That's pretty much here. prefer try schedule day they'll put vaccine time including three days unpaid attentence penalty miss work due adverse reactions.

Plus $100 shots card confirm. difficult time consuming task. Pretty fascinating video shows avoiding healtcare makes expensive long run, one reasons USA highest cost per person medical care. 
Free market makes things cheaper right? Right? already? thought even lower risk J&amp;J astra. children pass onto family Regarding J&amp;J hard time figuring Denmark going use use AZ. 

Denmark ignored large dataset AZ european adverse effect database EudraVigilance relied much smaller danish/norwegian dataset relatively severe cases (but absolute numbers) arrive conclusion.

So use J&amp;J based om EMA approval trust EMA analyze evaluate adverse effects correctly? 1-2 severe cases enough tip use AZ total 150K vaccinations given Denmark, anyone guarantee that? report him. would thought producing cheap effective covid vaccine cost would end bad PR? know break ya ... decades ago. US govt red tape saying ""eh good enough"". ""well run government program"" LOL best. reason one okay throwing absurd amount money it. Probably paying 5x efficient system could similar results.

I look USPS think massive waste money eliminated. still relying daily mail youve gotta like 90 years old point. Imagine buying stamp mailing something? Feels like using telegram something.. foreign me.

Anyways easy 4 hour waits vaccines retired people teachers work.

Trying 30 year olds even get sick corona anyways? Yeah good luck.

Pfizer vaccine still tested temperatures, could change. desperately lacking context am, London, Ontario.

Still worth reporting earth-shatteringly different narrative would London, England. bigger London actually less twice many daily cases, despite 20 times population.

The flair therefore misleading.  Aside *maybe* hospitals, nobody installed ventilation systems order curb Covid spread enclosed buildings. hardly expect business window door open. we’ve known primary mode transmission airborne aerosol form year (really seemed obvious whole time), done address this? used to, 180 covid related bookmarks (that formerly tabs), gave up.

Pfizer's one -20 far know. Blocked secure vaccines citizens Defence Production Act Pretty sad healthcare system sucks bad real headline.  aunt read article Facebook saying leads autism?? reporting issue, India's death toll less severe Western countries population younger less obese? I've (26M) Astrazeneca vaccine month ago. family friends too. side effects experienced we're feeling tired 1-2 days. Nobody know significant side effects. getting 2nd jab soon I'm offered it. Many us getting vaccinated now. would think shutdowns would unfair us become fully vaccinated immunity virus.

At point say ""The vaccine available, want protected go get it."" someone doesn't, they're taking risk, much like motorcycling without helmet. There’s one aircraft know without recirc fan that’s CRJ-200, sure recirc thing coming from. Sure there’s filter there, absolutely recirculated air that’s mixed bleed air. 

That said think people don’t even understand bleed air exists agree said. polls shown low 17%. isn’t always “hell no” “no They’re probably confused fact vaccine centers ask bring proof insurance get shot OWS great policy secure doses benefiting us now, Trump didn’t major distribution plan. fair, suspect that’s mostly Trump stopped semblance job losing Biden (which huge red flag itself), we’ll never really know would formulated plan re-election.

I, least, glad never find out. people vacationing takes time vaccine work. rush! like thousands people dying getting vaccine. 50 percent going cut it. get us herd immunity, again, dominant strain right now. 

We need 70 percent herd immunity. achieved that, discussion policy makers life might look like COVID begin end “Let’s wait see.” 

Americans dumb shortsighted. want want, want yesterday. viral pandemics don’t care want. don’t care economy, jobs, tired Zoom. Viruses care spreading mutating. still need focus that. 

I get year hell. long slog 12 months. people need realize expiration date. don’t want many deaths, need make decisions based science, based economy boredom. 

I’ve telling people along: customers die, keep business open then? 30 percent students die, classroom school then?

We better predicting path hurricanes strength earthquakes predicting path mutations virus. we’re great getting people evacuate deadly storm 7 Richter quake hits. it’s one thing contrarian/pessimistic vaccine wasn’t real option anyways. put shut up, think lot take jab  defense, I’ve honestly never heard anyone explicitly say it’s free. I’ve seen heavily implied don’t remember seeing stated always spend maximum amount time worrying dumbest people society. vaccine appointmet required upload scans card insurance. second thought, I'm uninsured!

I hope get ny grandma stuff fully vaccinated! Thanks r/Coronavirus bringing informations ASAP fucking state controlled newspaper wont show ""page 17"" going come stronger put faith polling. lot people 2016 see played out. Terrible analogy. Lowering taxes hurt anyone unless view taxation form punishment. Reinforces earlier point. forcing 5 people accept something admit “okay”. People want superior care willing pay it. reside Canada come US pay superior care.

You can’t level playing field turning grass pile ash saying “deal it”. It’s impossible US currently, unlikely seeing public health power mandated state federal government (which announced intent building anything like that.)

This insurance companies want negotiate discounts service providers exchange making in-network sending customers. Hospitals can't really afford discounts, instead jack base price discount back actually want charge.

Now understand lot insurance companies, lots different groups, gets different negotiated rates, etc. rates secret insurance companies want competitors know they're paying.

Because hospitals inflate prices made numbers, huge numbers insured people can't afford bills. hospital makes passing cost insurance companies insured we're vicious cycle price inflation.

The law changed medical services must billed exactly rate customers, matter insurance have. think companies send emails employees encourage get vaccinated say FREE! think would help lot. Hopefully media hype new recorded death.

CNN: Hold beer CDC said today less risk covid many times over, although give us actual data. 

But even that... alternatives. Young women get one vaccines. file where? want ""the hoax"" end.

Flu doesnt kill 550 thousand Americans year. 

U think world wants lockdown? think countries want fuck economy? No, in-order save citizens lives. big conspiracy. pretty logical already doing? I'd also add number first shots administered significant shows many people trust want vaccine likely get second shots later. definitely given 80% seniors would even want vaccine  pharmacy charge insurance administration vaccine - that’s reason collect insurance info. Basically it’s payment time resources. Trump administration also getting doses states significant numbers. Vaccine production delivery always going ramp up. point, made points graciously, people don’t want understand. 

The guy completely ignoring seasonality too. It'll different every state tripled amount J&amp;J using last week, it’s zilch. suspect pause definitely hurt Michigan state result + situation rn. I’m lucky got J&amp;J last week. It’s hard find appointments Detroit metro area atm, especially don’t access car.

Edit: least difficult find one last week, sure though really. Kids already habit wearing masks correctly school. Go Trumpy city/village. queues guess next step pay people money take it... Yet another article says 50% Americans 18 vaccinated already.... wonderful time live Taiwan! envy fast response shut Covid became entrenched. 

That makes sense positive lingering traces illness December. surprising traces still found many months. took someone taking seriously.

Are ill? past 5 years, get flu shots many times past - never anything even close reaction.  asshole. US gets shit time here. It’s nice we’re actually something right whole covid thing. yeah I’m bragging. bill far parties that. Check local state portal, even CDC decent list vaccine reports. know ways children die listed already governed extensive safety regulations. Florida state government hasn’t come said “car seats aren’t mandatory babies” - that’s recognize need protection. School buses traffic near well school zones safety protections speed limits, distance stopping, requiring kids seated, etc.

It’s reasonable comparison say children shouldn’t protected Covid federal, state local governments extensive regulations protecting them. Finally don’t get vaccines often might know. Besides Covid vaccine, get flu shot every year work offers free anyway Indiana begging people states get shot numbers don’t look like shit.

I doubt you, seeing that?

In hypothetical USA J&amp;J vaccine available, would agree you, delay could easily cost tens thousands lives lost COVID versus hundreds lives saved due holding vaccine. 

In USA plentiful supply safer effective mRNA vaccines, edge side holding J&amp;J, even costs hundred lives short term. continue push vaccine known issues better alternatives already available, antivax sentiment fueled years. ""Earth could wiped asteroid strike"" works ways, employer could require unvaccinated work home, demand show proof unvaccinated come office. can't ask doctor. got paid work get mine… respect, person you’re responding never made argument vaccines weren’t extremely effective stopping infection altogether. none vaccines **intended** prevent infection entirely. doesn’t matter catch now, it’s going jeopardize health significant way.

They made point wasn’t initial intent. wasn’t. initial intent vaccines reduce severity symptoms reduce hospitalization. We’ve always known mRNA really good chance also reducing transmission, always required data, we’re getting.

They’re also making completely factual, valid, accurate point even disregard point; vaccine doesn’t prevent infection entirely. Even you’re basing efficacy 95% number, that’s 100% that’s “entirely” it? 

Point is, we’re seeing really strong effectiveness mRNA vaccines particular that’s great, don’t prevent infection entirely. matter way look it. Acclrdong Dutch government deadly covid young women. 1/100k-1/500k die either.

Anybody gets one free want. I’m trying point fact still time surges occur again. rushed testing. Redditors also desperately want kids much higher risk serious illness covid actually are, apparently

Didn’t realize easily-googleable statistics low risk children pOliTiCaL pOsItIoN well. guess CDC lumps things together people don’t actually look study data. JJ pause won’t significant impact vaccination rate. Pfizer moderna supply exceed demand, enough everyone country. Also, current research points idea 3 vaccines pretty much effective variant won’t problematic. herd immunity? People absolutely welcome get vaccinated want to. may think they’re idiot, won’t feel sorry get covid, i’m getting vaccinated protect vaccinated people. I’m going way protect anti vaxxers.

There two large testing sites county, yet google ""covid test free"" pop up. know someone knows free... adverse reaction first Moderna vaccine. valid concern two doctors visits, two urgent care visits, dermatologist visit, two er trips one via ambulance collapsed. entire time told ""it's six days, reaction"" delayed adverse reaction Pfizer Moderna vaccines 8 days later.

It’s preventative care. may billed administration (less $100), that’s never experience. Typically get flu shot every year it’s totally free.

Children aren’t covered insurance get vaccinated free Vaccines Children program. Medicaid also covers child vaccines free. team ""a couple players time"" shut ""a week two""? We're way beyond reason point. ""stay home grandma could die"" crowd point ""I'll gladly sacrifice grandma I'm fragile alone longer.""

It's fucking sad. COVID tests supposed free too, insurance get bill later. It’s lot, I’m surprised people don’t know vaccine free. sucks get they're doubting they're conspiracy theorists. Humans suck. vaccination rate fantastic JJ got put pause knows long, variants already becoming dominant strains, large percentage population hesitant straight refuse get it. vaccines incredibly effective, we’re still ways away herd immunity.

Hey explain cases going down, I? 

You’re good numbers. There’s cool things called “fractions.” converted things called “percentages” multiply “fractions” 100. Check wiki “multiplication.”

So, there’s also concept called “time.” gets little confusing you’re talking theoretical physics, purpose discussion, check watch clock calendar phone. “time.”

So like, compare “percentages” “time” come “conclusion” *democRATS* “full shit” respect issue. It’s abstract, give go!! thats lotta ugly infected dudes. beards.

Imagine getting $5K bill epidural almost year baby born! Yes happened us. Still worth every penny though. mean specific trial try here:  would still wear mask businesses require around people I'm familiar sake making people uncomfortable. 

Other that, agree federal employees. dad worked USPS gotta honest insurance kid pretty freaking good. screw put broken elbow top surgeon including ER trip injury first happened think whole thing cost 500 bucks. blame US, prefer get mRNA one due issue, even causes slight delay weeks most. People risk tolerances, one can't really argue another's personal risk tolerance.

You're comments went far beyond Hell, there’s tons saying let’s give poor countries. Like, really? give dangerous vaccines poor proper ones?

Many poor countries mRNA vaccines available. absolutely must consider balance risks readily available alternative like US has. specifically addressing. Also, point CDC said vax dangerous? CDC said J&amp;J ""irresponsibly developed""?

Also stop acting like CDC / experts monolithic entity. listened meeting today, plenty experts saying J&amp;J decision disaster. whole resolution meeting making recommendation committee come decision due internal disagreement. clearly members wanted immediately resume certain demographics due relative risks. number go time goes second dose? Good points. I’d also add let virus spread completely also raise risks mutation evades vaccines.

We’re done thing cases negligible, adults vaccines. Covid March Madness would pay it? It’s free everyone US. doesn’t citizen. Undocumented workers eligible. Man, guys like make everything much hate libs?

You're exhausting. Media reporting smaller chance clots fucking birth control Scientific evidence vaccine hesitancy strongly correlates low cognitive ability. Beautiful. Nothing free.

And maybe people want yet either. likely want take conservative approach keep going there's shot kids. 

Not saying agree direction seem want go in. implying country whole resurgence despite exploding vaccination rate? Maybe aren’t anti vax necessarily totally neglecting efficacy vaccine. It’s efficacious essentially every vaccine exists. Lol limiting capacity somewhat understanding vaccine free, charge administering it. correct? fauci doesn’t really know either, he’s taking educated guess setting bar high people don’t mindset won’t need get vaccinated country hit herd already has. don’t know it, everyone DEAD!

Well, ones humans are. Pets still expensive. I’d true, guess recommendation use vaccines justified. 

On hand 5 cases VITT Norway 130K AZ vaccines 0 cases far million Pfizer vaccines - could due different groups getting different vaccines. US went whole week without 1000 deaths reported day! mean it’s known doctors nurses sick wearing masks many years. #sarcasm thousands workouts YouTube could've done. would rather whine government get workout in. Yeah, risk always there. Brazil big example it. can't find anything BC particular, know business owners Ontario, Quebec, Alberta arrested violating COVID-19 restrictions. I'm familiar Canadian laws, I'm definitely person ask. imagine they've known long, legal system BC must require kind civil court session scenario, happened yet (courts backed worldwide, doubt different Canada). course know that, guess  Canada sites, private company ready produce mRNA vaccines Canada fuck get ready production.

Do understand this? understand countries like US, UK, etc., invested huge amounts money re-tool existing vaccine manufacturing facilities handle mRNA production? 

Is part clear you? need diagrams? That's first time hear plant. Sanofi one? already producing ingredients finished vaccines? Level 2 3 surgical masks around here. Basically true medical grade version blue paper ones. provide box available non patient staff.  kind prove point. Canada production site GSK/Sanofi, whose vaccine ended delayed. I.e Belgium huge manufacturing site Pfizer, ended rights successful vaccine. simply flip coin every pandemic happens right manufacturer country, big countries (the US) small ones happened get lucky (i.e Belgium) get smug keep first? every manufacturer build production site like every single country purely piss nobody off? 

And no, lack money issue here. I.e Biontech straight said money world would allow magically create production facilities already building time frames needed.  right now, we're point need chase people get shots.

In area, maybe. 

Most (non-medical-worker) peers (~40) gotten shots due standby lists many people showing appointments age range offered (60-70) simply coming numbers anticipated. tell us bring anyone else know 16 us. True probably smoother everyone allowed.

My grandparents vaccinated last week vaccination center Sneek (Friesland). people working told capacity 1400 vaccination per day, currently 400 vaccinations per day. employer, hospital, emailed everyone said optional. also said get get sick can't use PTO bank B. 

Which second PTO bank use get surgery, pregnant, flu. bullshit bank can't access, use week bank A, use B. Bank one access days off. also get paid bank B quit retire. staff put bullshit beyond me.

Once last round vaccinations done Kong VS Godzilla hopefully going first theatrical film year I'm literally counting days. already vaccine passports. Kids cant go school unless thier regular vaccines. covid vaccines different?

After all, talking people dying, eat restaurant whatever. used even scientific evidence prioritize men women country would burned ground now. Even though used statistics prioritize non-whites whites. also thought Americans want universal healthcare true anymore : would go dumb option. Ivermectin. be. Why? people (mostly, I’m generalizing) say take vaccine (preventative measure) ivermectin take 10+ times normal dose? Could ivermectin work? course, like vaccines have, need run safety efficacy trials idea works Canada. imagine needs brought court, happened yet, since courts backed up. know though, I'm familiar Canadian business laws. virus wont magically disappear day hit 75%.

The virus never magically disappear.

We never get 100% vaccination rate vaccine 100% effective. goal not, never been, never get 0 cases 0 deaths reopen. can't arrest owners first?

However, argument could made non-profit open license. say anyone able manufacture (provided licensed facility). mean, ain't free, already paid Maybe, every time someone posts TIL public libraries free always shocking number people turn saying they're also learning that.. public library system always free. 12 even vaccination radar yet.

Actually, multiple studies already underway vaccine kids 12. hospitalization death stats demographic extremely there's many unknowns variants 

Good thing (if read actual studies instead clickbait headlines), current vaccines still effective known variants. article states 40% 5,800 cases 60 years old. bit less permanent article suggests. situation changes still reversed. changes could include missing delivery alternatives, increased number infections. 

This decision basically ""so long cases, get alternative vaccine, use it."" live country healthcare basically scam interaction runs risk financial ruin. probably tune talk medical anything them. Let us talk implication would ticket price, pollution...

This false solution problem.

Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* biggest issue IMO JJ vaccine one world needs. minimizing risk using alternative works great West, places perfect cold chain storage issue ""if risk scared, use mRNA vaccines"" since can't get say rural Ethiopia, Amazon. Pfizer booster works sound like either booster targeting Africa Brazil variants directly, sound like greatest threat. one helpful things seen AZ maybe thing Reddit impact life. likely eligible AZ soon low medium risk area (4 per 10k rising). going sign rather wait two months Pfizer Moderna.  Thanks. Either way, incidence either happening incredibly small, get population large putting much weight this. 

I get science community doctors/scientists discussing this, chances getting stroke due COVID incredibly small begin with. 

Some articles people sub make believe COVID, matter time something catastrophic happens. Everyone know bar 98 year old great grandmother COVID got rid COVID without issue. Agreed. It’s complicated. 

Like said, chance getting covid play here. 1/10 number years time, shouldn’t used compare chances today wait. 

The latest numbers saw 70k confirmed cases 230m people. current rate 0.03% total population infected. since 30M already infected, it’s 0.035% possible people (assuming reinfections). 

But people vaccinated. remove 123M one shot (0.09% rate)? 69M gotten (0.053% rate)? 

And like pointed out, reduce chances infected social distancing, masking, etc. infected rate number go people vaccinated. 

But issue everyone delayed 30 days get vaccine due reduced supply, means infections people, additional infections spreads. 

Personally, think real question looked country world view. need data points. One AZ / JJ vaccines, many people get covid till herd immunity. Second pull AZ / JJ, many people get covid till herd immunity. finally, keep AZ / JJ, many people get blood clots. 

But get ethical debate known healthy person potential blood clot bs unknown deadly virus ""Some places"" good enough, every place. 100% different. Incivility allowed automod bizarre covid conspiracies are? I'm out. Fuck sub. want all. 10% population confirmed sick COVID, moot point.

It's basically net zero anyway. nobody takes vaccine likelihood getting infected would higher. age beautifully. I've surgery 4 times. believe risk dying anesthesia several times higher risk blood clots AstraZeneca I'm sure people still trust Pfizer statement made endemic profit model yearly boosters deep concern experts parsing data coming decided pause JNJ jabs, many cases AZ. 
I trouble believing small number blood clots they're hearing trying get bottom of. ""Watch do, say."" they're seems trying get handle much bigger problem. Yeah, nah, I’m good, thanks. *always* going possibility scary variant (or - get - completely different virus!) lurking around corner. Always has, always be. Get used it. 

If want live rest life worrying every worst-case scenario, good luck that.  mean know bad saying weeks now? places government IDs free low income easily accessible (often mail) still limits access require ID. different. Definitely agree certain point don’t need worry people choosing get shot. That’s choice manage risk chosen accept getting vaccinated.

We aren’t yet. long study done? meant evil comment.. understand benefits outrank issue here, still, really useful data world. Hey, Dwight. literally intent vaccines. everyone get vaccinated gets herd immunity actually starts working intended whatever percentage population specific virus. Covid happens need high percentage vaccinations order jump start hwrd immunity think idea may people use argument vaccines article maybe getting ahead that. Herd immunity ""kill virus completely"". Herd immunity slow spread.

Its quite difficult prove negative,[ heres PBS article covid herd immunity goal get “herd immunity,” enough people immunity, either vaccination past infection, stop uncontrolled immunity doesn’t make one person immune, outbreaks still flare up. means virus longer easily jumping person person, helping protect still vulnerable catching it.

Herd immunity kill virus completely. That's flat wrong. reduce speed spreads, therefore reduce number cases. virus still around though. case mRNA vaccines developed all. country would willing invest vaccine production infrastructure reward getting spot line according population. 

How would get conclusion? Especially since Pfizer/Biontech even take upfront money development vaccine infrastructure, except 500 Million € EU Germany, far know, sort exclusivity attached. reason Pfizer export US got especially sweet deal, executive order orders Americans vaccinated first exports. also 10s millions AZ doses sitting US even though even approved I'm struggling understand citizens ""smaller"" country like Canada, chosen invest production capacity work manufacturers set up, deserves ""equal access"" something another country spent billions produce. 

My whole point simply feasible every nation 10 million + people production sites every single kind vaccine. Would Belgium especially smart giant Pfizer mRNA production site country simply banning export Belgians vaccinated? Canada dumb Sanofi/GSK site instead? Sanofi/GSK would big winner vaccine race, Canada ban exports nation pad shoulder superior vaccine investment strategy Belgian mRNA Canada money could've done Israel chose to.

Think through. Everyone brilliant idea simply pay Israel did. Everyone simply pays more. Instead 50 billion profit, Pfizer makes 100 Billion. think leads noticeable improvement vaccine supply? vaccine manufacturing world maxed. little improve supply complicated supply chains short time frames. look giant mess chip industry right now, similar issues. simply enough capacity building capacity takes time. certainly agree vaccine vs virus pretty clear equation point. usually Americans get gouged anything related healthcare. we’re vaccine rollout absolutely incredible, we’re used paying ass healthcare costs, fact it’s free somewhat surprising. vaccination hospitals prioritizing beds, proportionally hospitalizations among severe symptoms. reduced pressure healthcare system, doctors may comfortable admitting people moderate symptoms treatment observation. context patients benefit reduction symptoms due vaccination well early intervention.

Severity fully vaccinated people probably going difficult pinpoint. Israel started vaccination highest risk populations, initially would represented fully vaccinated population. Adding variants concern could also complicate discussion. Since women far, think look factor birth control. I've always read birth control increase risk blood clots.

I take low dose aspirin safe side anyways. take account numbers fluctuate. got Moderna know long fully immune AstraZeneca, get numbers pretty low (I'm talking area) wait start going up, make appointment, wait wait vaccine kick in. cases went around 20 day 300 day almost overnight area, adds ton risk. Plummeted better zero. Well said. Yea alright dude. coming guy said don’t change subject even though one brought government first. don’t like it, doesn’t make less true. Brush actual facts emotions guide life. Dude, talk variants, people clueless risk COVID19 related age. People think young people risk older people (Canada) media doctors making way. leading call - even medical professionals - vaccinate essential workers 20s instead general population 50s. really bad, unfortunate. think that's going end story. blood clot scare forgotten millions billions people poor countries get vaccine grateful it. rich countries grateful covid wiped instead left simmer slums world mutate variants resistant expensive vaccines. sure getting downvoted. major factor. Birth control increase risk blood clotting. Women also higher risk developing blood clots men general. well researched understood things medicine. I’m sure plays role situation.  yet, despite people thinking healthcare unaffordable mind bogglingly complicated navigate jargon insurance co-pays usual customary rates deductibles shit.... people still get mad talk going single-payer system reduce costs make administration use simple easy understand

People stupid yet front page. Everyone take fact waiting fact. 

If first question pops head reading comment ""Don't want everyone vaccinated? anti Vax?"" part echo chamber. 

Wait peer reviewed evidence, spread word. test, tell super effective. I'm kind surprised. figured world leaders fully vaccinated now. already confirmed medical professionals scientists covid likely stick around like flu? Gender social construct, doesn’t matter Source? curing sick person there.

The bar much higher vaccines giving healthy person. Hugo de Jonge please take notes mean, yeah.. masks 100 percent protection. We've known year get totally - scared get second Pfizer ended sore arm. Stay hydrated try let horror stories get you. great hear. country mRNAs around, Astra chinese one. sure apply percentage, would nice. last timely shipment Moderna vaccine arrived Canada March 11, according information provided Globe Mail Public Health Agency Canada. Since then, shipments hundreds thousands shots arrived later expected, trend continue weeks ahead, PHAC said.

I think part what's important article. lot Moderna's shipments arrived late multiple batches, apparently due quality control issues. Hopefully things start smooth US finished campaign get doses instead fly Switzerland/Spain. read somewhere insured may still get hit copay charge. state populous union 10 million people less *deaths per capita* one state 10 million less people that’s know Texas shit government

You seriously evaluate critical thinking skills dude. UK set trials using alternating doses different vaccines. 1 pfizer, one AZ &amp; vice versa. expanding included J&amp;J Novavax. using currently approved original Moderna. Hopefully help give idea vaccine compatability top finding using different vaccines give might give even better immune response.

The last read pfizer planning testing 3rd dose original covid19 vaccine see improves response variants considering making different vaccine specific variant(s).

Novavax already working variant specific vaccine. remember correctly consdiering trial shot original vaccine well solo booster. course *possible*, evidence suggest currently going happen. Let's cross bridge come it, currently, worry it.  hilarious quickly “no lockdowns, curfews, vaccines” crowd try obstacle feasible solution pandemic! No, take look Israel - cases plummeted. Elimination happening. Vaccines are. Fact matter is, big proportion population terrible risk management. understand magnitude probability, lot people assessments they're erronously. Yeah we're going need source claim. data clinical trials shows 66% efficacy symptomatic Covid J&amp;J, closer 80% US, 100% efficacy hospitalizations death. confidence intervals around numbers nothing I've seen shown ""below 70% effective preventing severe Covid hospitalizations."" Well, statement flat slap face medical professionals. Yes, public whole selfish, pride seeing saved ignorance. “Won’t someone please think children!” - Helen Lovejoy Hence took first jab. see lesser evil compared covid. brain fog, forgetfulness, struggle think behaviours terrify me. risk worth calculated. Calculate risk getting multiplied risk developing serious complications death compare risk vaccine. That's countries starting recommend older people continue getting vaccines since risks covid higher young people told wait risks lower. Unfortunately people read headline think exonerates AZ.

The choice Covid AZ, AZ vaccines. like I'm gonna purposely inject virus. Despite massive mistakes done countries like US, Canada Europe generally, they're even close happened happening Brazil. 

If feel cheated afraid situation country, even think feeling around here. 

I 28yo, obese ICU (100Kg 178cm) although appear I'm thaaaat fat. sedentary years, although I'm exercising eating better time. comorbidities. anxiety. 

 

I'm fucked anxiety. get covid now, whatever stay home much possible, avoid seeing people on. Still, fear could get covid new variant here. new variant filling hospitals young people 20 40yo, putting ICU dying, even without comorbidities. fucked think about, hear it... hospitals full, medications lacking. vaccines exist going fast hoped for. 

 

My choice keep protecting hard hoping persist untouched Covid get vaccinated, least ease fears dying it. 

 

I heard nasal spray also turning valid treatement, also hope comer FAST brazil. April 30th last day blocking middle seats. succeeding preventing deaths.. rest yet seen. countries reduced risk zero ever going take unnecessary risk given economy back almost full employment population act normal right now. nothing gained. data coming seemingly confirms findings clinical trial thought 2 weeks, one dose provides 80% protection? natural. Humans often workshy seek distraction, especially postmodern times. even percentages? J&amp;J 6 cases no?  
Then roughly 6x fewer young men vaccinated, nothing go of. 

Similarly EU vaccine young people UK fairly small terms population. 

It would great see anything, entirely possible enough young people vaccinated. Sorry, corrected, sometimes english fails autocorrect unhelpful. Preventing hospitalization really criteria ""kill virus completely"". long theres variants survive someone's system theres chance mutate something deadly time. city requires masks outdoors maybe 20-25% people it, fair large amount tourists care. eight times?

That's worrying sorta implies AZ vaccine safe, due fact rate covid causing clots extremely high dangerous.

1/8th really fucking bad still pretty fucking bad. likely combination both. Bullshit talking point. Canadian system quite lot universal health systems much less expensive (in tax dollars per capita, even *before* factor private spending) produce better results US system every metric. People continue deny facts prolonging suffering, financial ruin, death horrible system brings. Sure, SEARCH information anything, single mention blood clots would totally ignore study. strong conflict interest. know AZ (coproduced Oxford University) troubled Oxford University conducting study pure bias. point everyone immunised caught developed immunity, always floating around, like flu, it’ll come back every year, like flu, it’s easily transmitted, like flu.

It’s like small pox cornered driven vaccine. big deal? Anglo media/nation/interests admitting got good vaccine pushing use matter what. J&amp;J vaccine stopped AZ? US 1 vaccine developed? argument would make sense complication covid potential brain clot. saying weigh risks brain clot vaccine vs. one infection really, since clots anaphylactic reactions seem major risks vaccine weighing risks vs risk getting covid, include: hospitalization, permanent lung damage, brain damage, cardiac injury, pulmonary embolism, stroke, death, etc... comment linking marketwatch.com automatically removed source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Gettin paid pain adults eligible May 1st risk kid astronomically low. never 100%. good, never 100%. 

That bogus number came trials mostly done younger people going die first place. zero PLACEBO COVID deaths! Would therefore conclude PLACEBO prevents 100% 

The two vaccine trials explicitly report hospitalizations efficacy outcome make latter issue clear. vaccine, one person control group severe COVID-19, eight people hospitalized; [Johnson &amp; 34 people placebo group severe COVID-19, five people hospitalized. It’s true zero vaccinated people hospitalized either study vaccines took effect. numbers small, can’t draw reliable conclusion high efficacy may outcomes. 

As Diana Zuckerman National Center Health Research [pointed Johnson &amp; Johnson trial, **“It’s misleading tell public nobody vaccinated hospitalized unless also tell 5 people placebo group hospitalized.”** She’s right. can’t confident predicting effectiveness precisely wider population outside trial, either. example, vaccine trials included relatively people older 60 participants.

You see fragile numbers looking compiled severe disease. **In the** [**Pfizer example, one vaccinated person developed severe COVID-19 versus three placebo group—which meant single bout disease made difference calculated efficacy rate 66 percent one 100 percent.** 

For trials, zero people severe disease vaccinated group versus one control group, adding subtracting one would even dramatic. **The problem even greater deaths. efficacy analysis, two vaccine trials—for Moderna’s Johnson &amp; Johnson’s—reported COVID-19 deaths control groups.** Sure agree option. EU: ""wHaT uK eVeR dOnE vAcCiNeS!? get nothing back right steal AZ supplies!"" Massive CI Yeah pretty good put like that. Thanks. one sits middle everyone wins two armrests lol Yes. many states dropping mandates early already. think lot women would argue pill necessary; lots secondary issues controlled it. Migraines, debilitating cramps, anemia excess bleeding, sex work, abuse relationships etc. continued studies BCPs. Hormonal birth control increase breast cancer risk, requires procedures use. would consider BCP cases, pregnancy COVID, something worth considering risk analysis. worth taking pill control severe migraines there's low risk TTP? government (The Netherlands) holding test event weeks 10.000 people everyone tested beforehand. Meanwhile can't go uni, can't sports, can't go restaurant (even outside). testing events cost us 1 billion, available small number people. 
What event contribute mystery, everyone vaccinated coming months.. makes feel little better. Thanks. talking about? That's straight forward statement, saying ""heh"" shows little empathy. clearly work field responsible human lives. situation also dramatic several months ago mean new situation called dramatic exceeds previous numbers. question health care workers' feelings? vaccine expert, help disappointed pause J&amp;J everyone US. local clinic scheduled J&amp;J adult men use drop-in homeless shelter. Outreach difficult convince residents get 1 dose vaccine, trying convince residents 2 dose vaccine something even difficult. folks even screwed get COVID (not even mention risk spread within shared shelter facility) possible rate specific type blood clot that's investigated. Democrats: “voter ID racist, discriminates marginalized. “

Democrats: “vaccine passport great idea, won’t discriminate marginalized”

Pick one. 

If think voter ID racist carrying around vaccination records picture along with, birth date etc also discrimination. also need consider alternative options, getting different vaccine. Gotta ask Palestinians, living Israel People allowed choose also take account decision ""get vaccine not"", something like ""not take AZ vaccine get Pfizer 3 months less chance rare brain clots"". Masks work - vaccines.

So vaccines roll out, start laying groundwork eliminating mask mandates. evidence there. problem demanding 100% certainty, particularly context killer pandemic. instance, retrospective study early showed daily aspirin use associated 50% lower covid19 mortality. rational person would say, tell people take daily aspirin symptom onset, especially since would choosing tylenol/ibuprofen anyways.
the fundamental problem heart decision making medicine. bayesian model appropriate. Yeah must explanation, thought case government covering that, would one county 100% free recipient questions asked.

If guess, I'd say local / state government thing. Like said, maybe state (or county whatever) funding admin costs center. I’ll probably feel better May tbh. pain stomach last night pretty late again. I’m gonna come back check every 4-5 days safe lol. People working 3 jobs, gon' get paid.  think ask friends would say well Right, one gets choose get COVID. people get vaccinated everyone get COVID. there’s real question gets ethics around whether AZ J&amp;J still surged developing countries outbreaks (see: Brazil). 

Feels elitist, countries probably around getting huge doses Pfizer/Moderna anytime soon

Would seem huge net save lives That's true countries enough supply need vaccinate 30-40 people. Especially EU. Yeah, definitely need get bottom it. Like said, choice, get one that’s causing issues. guess worry it’s increased vaccine hesitation general this, could end costing lives end. Yeah fruitcakes believe God wants getting COVID brain clot COVID vaccine blood clot. would like congratulate EMA European Union yet another wise decision. Thanks putting us risk prolonging lockdowns. would better describe 10% per year far

But year AstraZeneca mRNA availability individual? someone living developed country, probably doesn’t.

It compares rate known COVID-positive cohort equivalent mRNA vaccinated cohort ( influenza reference). used purpose. Got first dose Moderna yesterday.

Into night injection site swelled became rather painful, feel exhausted. middle night felt almost feverish - kind feeling right fever kicks bad cold. Woke morning headache.

If “very mild” case COVID feels like, don’t even want imagine real thing.

P.S.: Never got adverse reaction beyond sore arm vaccines before. Ah, makes sense. many confounding factors, vaccinated people older age average. 

Overall, could characteristics make vaccine work well person also makes susceptible dying catch COVID without vaccine. case, risk catching COVID would 1/8; tell total infection rate USA 1/10 someone who's taking precautions like masking distancing, almost certainly even less.

If get rid covid-19, probability getting becomes nearly 100%. question time. risk serious healthy outcome even young healthy folks still minimally 1/1000, waaay worse risk negative vaccine reaction Agree Seems reasonable, Isreal indication we're 1-2 months low numbers. We've also lot natural infection Isreal. Thanks award! r freaking reason whatsoever. Birth control 1 1000 chance develop clots whereas vaccine 1 1000000. Yet use birth control.

The risks outweigh benefits!  India, know 4 doctors got hospitalized severe symptoms even fully vaccinated. think people downvoting think talking US. 

Typical Reddit Bias. Yeah that's meant overall benefits personal health last sentence. direct comparison COVID-related blood clots specifically think unproductive. reminds Va-poo-rize! 

But still works would incredible asset fight Covid! use something measure... I've seen individuals teams post social media giving shots players. think eligibility rules different state would harder coordinate date bring bunch players together without see skipping line. would nice see NBA something, maybe PSA images clips team clinics. question using AZ non-question hysteria, claim be. matter risk assessment.

Which people hilariously bad at. Exactly. vaccine side effects definitely worth vs getting extremely ill dying COVID. Here’s thing though. everyone decided get vaccine 1 million risk whatever, chance getting COVID next years probably north 50% since wouldn’t go away 

Not getting vax side effect concerns selfish. It’s basically “everyone else take 1 million risk I’ll reap benefits herd immunity” That's fair statistic, vaccinated people, I'm assuming still quarantine themselves. B.C. ski resort centre P1 variant concern outbreak, local epidemiologist sounding alarm outdoor COVID-19 Carr, epidemiologist founder EPI Research Inc., says outbreak largest P1 variant outbreak outside want clear, safer, safe. increase risk indoors also increase risk outdoors,” said P1, commonly known Brazil variant, two half times infectious original virus. variant yet detected Manitoba Carr given opportunity spread every person transmits virus opportunity mutations occur,” said Carr. choosing role dice catching likely catch disease many times dangerous all, including brain clots AZ JJ vaccine. Vaccine: drug, administered HEALTHY person. 

There zero sense comparing risk introduced HEALTHY body man-made medical compound risks brought upon virus contraction causes particular manifestation disease - least unless British publication ""defending honor"" British vaccine specific risk profile. know doctor ""fully vaccinated"" detectable level antibodies still. 

This Brazil one Chinese vaccines, still... would #2 list guess. Great answer! seen put like before. Yes she’s pretty solid. I’ve problem her. Bit miserable whatever. It’s actually true county department health. Delaware County, PA one population half million people. would bet rural counties small populations don’t either. Depends much longer COVID continues prevalent community, kind precautions individual taking it, local case rates one's specific community, etc. things go show apples-to-apples everyone's situation different.

But yes whatever reason someone unable speak doctor personal situation, opinion still prevailing advice get vaccinated. Certainly countries much dependent non-mRNA vaccines USA turning noses it. CDC messaging issues way whole thing politicized. careful declaring things safe whatever say going attacked.

Back early days, told stop buying masks mask shortages hospitals hard time getting ahold them. told wear masks discovered easily transmissible air. day people use attack CDC. ""First tell us *this* tell us *that.* keep chaining minds. know they're doing.""

Because idiocy, understand CDC would drag feet this. last May declared surfaces safe, months later discovered surfaces safe thought, would create lot confusion public would give Republicans new line attack try discredit CDC. No. well settles officials definitely ban Covid Context matters. expected 2 1.5 million, 6 1.5 million WAY expectations. Triple number fact. Sounds scary, sounds huge, see still 6 1.5 million, risk many every day activities vastly dangerous, see risk COVID causing type clotting greater ""elevated"" risk.

I accept ""pause"" mainly make sure health officials necessary guidance look treat rare issue, turns sort ""pause"" eventually drop quietly like countries done AZ, shambles, sets terrible benchmark.

What find something equally rare ""concerning"" mRNA vaccines? going miniscule risk say ""whoopsie, guess gotta dodge COVID instead 1 million risk high :)""? go virus. Fuck this, super cautious entire time still got it, roommate went work everyday contracted probably public transport somewhere work. far feeling fine, incubation period isn‘t yeah. thought could escape virus are. cautious people. IMO, J&amp;J getting bad rap.  paused vaccine due 6 serious issues almost 7 million doses.

Someone replied someone else already done math me. link total risk getting Covid severe disease compared getting rare HIT like clotting issue vaccines. Why? design vaccine, BioNTech. partnered Pfizer testing manufacture.  
I disagree deserve credit remuneration this, develop it. doesn’t attempts study rate Ad vector vaccines.

It gives us statistic unvaccinated COVID cases useful *evaluating* rate seen adenovirus vector vaccines. think Memorial Day turning point, even officially drop mandates open things up. point think basically anyone wants vaccinated be. got $122 bill(after getting student discount $420ish bill) getting COVID COVID antibody test. Good insurance cover it. won’t surprised actually charging people vaccine didn’t insurance. OMG bring Germany please 🥺 need badly See, told vaccines don’t even work. /s understand agree also find funny British papers comes excuses using vaccine another choice linked causing blood cloths. someone concerned always get one, AZ JJ needs find subset people issues vaccine. Given choice gives small chance complication another not, want one doesn’t. question. article says it’s hard fight misinformation coming people they’re posting factual articles. also says we’re caught temporary vacuum real guidance investigate what’s going blood clotting.

Does seem little bit like we’re holding onto vaccines based faith? face (admittedly rare) negative side effects lack conclusive evidence they’re concern, we’re holding breath stepping faith? saying “I know heart vaccines safe,” waiting science catch belief? so, doesn’t seem much different opposite side fence, “just know” vaccines dangerous. willing change opinions based evidence, insist must? Please double fact check reddit posts. often not, people spout bullshit that's convincing speak authority post many links actually check reasonable amount time. said she'd wait allowed could undercount, likely people get infected despite vaccinated strong candidates death already. can't really measure way trying to. city's vaxx event, told covering administrative fees. Still uncharted territory effect long term efficacy! 1% death rate? 0.1% 1/10 catching?  Seems higher blood clot Go get J&amp;J Vaccine 6 months you’re due you’re concerned. Interestingly, US exactly Israel began steep decrease early February. February 7, Israel reported 37.7% least one shot 22.2% fully vaccinated. Today, US 37.3% 23.1%, respectively. 

Obviously Israel moving much faster vaccination campaign likely compounded effect nosedive cases, I'm excited see US fares reached point could theoretically see vaccination effects start take place. I'm still feeling great vaccines well, feel pointed lots 77 million much time get infected. 

For instance, became fully vaccinated yesterday would count literally enough time get infected, develop symptoms realize get tested, get tested, get test results back, result included official numbers. mean financially it’s going make sense employer entire workforce vaccinated soon possible, made mind make incentives strong. Heart gold aside it’s savvy move also makes look good convinced regular provider would find way monetize would get stuck bill, went local pharmacy got injections there. thought too. people going end getting infected Covid 1 million chance people develop blood clots. Public health decisions focused broader situation individual outcomes low level issues imho. Probably useful take look greater time scales. long term risk getting covid depends immunization people. chose take vaccine lucky belong 30% protected herd immunity get disease eventually. picture herd immunity individual risk blood cloths independent infection rate. comparison vaccine disease may appropriate. honestly know comments I've seen talking friends, scared completely witless feel comfortable something feel 100% protection.

It's weird people completely embrace disruption fear, like wanting happen finally excuse. getting downvoted imply know lot vaccinated hospitalized individuals. That's statistically possible. 

 ""I know quite people got vaccinated even second dose get admitted hospital severe symptoms. "" younger and/or healthier asked either take low risk catching disease even lower risk harming them, taking vaccine may largely unknown factor. many places ask sincere questions vaccine risk without met form hostility. Sorry calling troll. know new information coming us left right. see say many deaths 60, though. That's stat matters here. I'm also guessing many high profile players refusing get vaccinated. Would surprised Kyrie thought hoax? Part even surprised happened even though never even asked insurance. Heh, pretty much vaguest statement ever. course situation ICUs worsening, case tally growing fast days ago (and still growing although fast). Still mean situation hospitals ""dramatic"". chance catching covid 1/10. would better describe 10% per year far, given COVID still exists continues infect new people. 

This differs risk associated vaccine one-time risk, rather ongoing risk like getting COVID. 

As result magnitude risk covid higher back napkin math suggesting. big deal. vaccines prevented hospitalization death trial, real world run situations people factors make vaccines much less effective.

If analysis 74 deaths likely find significant risk factors play made vaccine long shot them. understand we've vaccinated hundreds millions people, going people vaccine going much for. tiny number, though.           helps I've tinitus 30 years longer major issue me. background effectively notice time.  like idea picking date. like idea picking vaccine target. say June 15th come June 15th 10% population shot, way early. 90% population shot tomorrow wait 'til June 15th that's dumb. birth control pills 500 times likely. whole thing non-issue.

If Miami, Florida odds probably 1:2. wasteland Dakotas, probably 1:1000. whole time vaccines main focus therapeutics largely ignored. think there's inherent belief vaccines better treatments confer immunity make jazzier headlines. clear, means 53 countries European region defined Who, 27 EU member states (although course subset 53) completely surprising. We've raised knowing rules change, people lie, expect kicked - especially we're down. ""when"". That's August. April. really depends whether remote schooling becomes permanent thing  everybody pulling AZ J&amp;J vaccines?

seems like must story they're telling us... Surely you’d vaccinate everyone too. We’re looking vaccinating maybe people 30s? still going tons young adults kids won’t vaccinated catch it, often without knowing, pass mutate away.

You’d start full vaccination program children vaccinated like measles several diseases, that’s gone anywhere. Coincidentally California set reopen June 15th, I’m guessing agree math. US still laughing stock barley quarter population gotten vaccine it’s available months now. anti-vaccine information coming US well. guys bunch failures honest. Exactly. rationally self-interested actor evaluate simple formula determine whether take vaccine: risk vaccine &lt; risk COVID x probability COVID, take vaccine. Otherwise reject. 

This actually fundamentally get inherent skepticism anti-vaxxers, rare side effects, health experts government agencies would tremendous incentive hide it’s still better society vaccinated, even break couple eggs along way. 

If people realize effectively still achieve zero risk contracting disease herd immunity avoiding vaccine avoiding side effects risk, rationally self-interested decision reject vaccination. Problem is, many people it, society won’t achieve herd immunity first place. creates free rider problem, CDC I’d everything could squash skepticism, legitimate not, prevent happening. That's theory, keep mind we've never attacked flu MRNA vaccines either. working COVID vaccine within days getting COVID genetic info. problem flu guess strain become big one, try make vaccine/stockpile spreads around world. MRNA vaccines could proven safe general thing, infrastructure could set quickly make things, might entering new era rapidly rolling specifically targeted vaccines right away hear new virus. Sure. think would madness keep vaccine passports beyond end pandemic though. soon we’ve gotten point deaths become rounding error grand scheme things, can’t imagine there’s need vaccine passport. really problem, next year problem (I hope). cases blood cloth Pfizer far I'm aware. Although think much Pfizer all. sister tested times. one location (urgent care something) never charged. another location charged another visit. 

It confusing say least. lack transparency absolutely prevents people using healthcare. Hmm.. that's mathematics know, intelligent thought works? diseases realistically cannot eradicated outright part reservoirs nature. SARS-CoV-2 absolutely class. Human-specific diseases like smallpox rare case eradicated outright. Heparin standard treatment patients hospitalized COVID, risk increased clotting well understood since early pandemic. Takes literally 2 seconds google ""nyc excess deaths"" still spread covid amongst without vaccines

And know long term effects Covid children adults getting world-wide herd immunity hard unlikely. We've trying eradicate polio decades, vaccine much easier store administer far cheaper.

It'll probably like measles, first world countries herd immunity, still get flare ups due reintroduction reservoir third world. that's case... US pfizer moderna far heavy lifting vaccinations anyway.... jnj accounting 3% vaccinations... what's problem pausing enough supply ensure anyone wants vaccines get one? Change cases day day essentially meaningless really relevant sort analysis pandemic going. social following toxicity far. Morons Thomas Riker says ignore Tuvix. actually read I've written consistent changed position all.

I'm done this.. enjoy wherever live. It'll like time regardless wishes. Thanks high rate clot AZ could covid... That's great point -- vaccine clotting risk definitely appears higher healthy young women (than average), could make decision tougher healthy young woman also less likely severely ill COVID (than average) Airborne droplet. terms viruses, example airborne disease measles. spread air, remain viable air hours. Airborne spread allows virus float freely own, viral particle.

Droplet spread different isn’t airborne. virus coated respiratory secretions, mucus, saliva, can’t exactly float air way airborne virus can. liquid surrounding viral particles falls ground, taking virus it. virus can’t survive well liquids around evaporate, one reason it’s unlikely become infected touching surface touching eyes, nose, mouth. droplet, though travels air short distance, considered airborne.

Covid (and does) aerosolize become airborne. happens patient hospital breathing tube taken out, techniques used procedure. It’s really specific scenario hospital setting, though. “real world”, day day life, would unlikely encounter virus airborne state — example, walk unoccupied room, unlikely become infected virus air leftover people room hour before. It’s close contact (less 6 feet apart unmasked) infected person spread droplets. guess data we're missing many times higher chance clots people covid? Kids don’t need vaccinated. kind virus gives tinnitus? I'm California. Went Savon Albertsons grocery making appointment. asked insurance, said no, received shot literally 3 minutes later, problem - easy.

Pledge doses. Dec. 27 March 26 36% yesterday per maine cdc Vaccines aren’t always effective anyway. UK (and lots places assume) people certain age vulnerable offered flu vaccine, still thousands die every year.

Covid even contagious flu it’s knocking around children young people without causing much trouble, barely even noticed, could well keep mutating away coming back every winter like flu. Sometimes it’s mild variant, sometimes it’s deadly. I’m gonna report like day tell individual numbers meaningless there’s huge lack kind experiments ethical reasons. I’m glad they’re going could provide useful data next pandemic (I mean let’s honest, happen again). Event venues clubs never even got chance prove right. one Los Angeles Times staffers worked piece. questions, fire away. bad none government policy communication focused this. basketball courts closed year! even closed walking trails months!

Honestly isnt much thing BC around long insane amount cheap generics every type pill. Drug companies much profitable drugs devote resources to. clinic go asked insurance info. They’ll bill insurance, weren’t even sure whether I’d receive bill vaccine. US healthcare nutshell. literally websites literature every where. news 24/7. like first GD thig say. free. let anyone tell isn't. People read pay attention ffs. like people trying stupid. Yeah bet it’s “not Indy” anything else.  IL decent ish sized city booked forever.  soon hit red IL though super easy book next day vaccines. 

I got first shot I’m Danville. set appointment day one three people there.  Walgreens put second shot like 4-5 weeks third week hit another hick town closer next day appointment. 

Now Chicago odd set restrictions Gary site might well Chicago point, heh. 

Anyway, congrats jab! Definitely symptoms/side-effects second shot. shot 9am feel anything afternoon, mild aches (and crazy arm pain like first shot). mild aches lasted day two.

The difficult part 6:30pm, thankfully relatively brief period time. Severe chills myalgia set 6:30pm, along high fever (103.7 peak around 8 9pm) dizziness throughout. shook maybe 2-3 hours get warm. myalgia made hard walk (seriously!) get comfortable sitting laying. painful. fingers (and everything else) hurt quite badly. concerned fever high, thankfully, quickly came on, 11pm significantly painful impairing side effects dissapated. back initial mild aches nothing else. 

It worth vaccinated I'd again. 4-5 hours debilitating though. I'm thankful worst last longer. 100% Maybe community vaccination center fully funded one way another need recoup administration costs, compared drug store chain going want recoup administrative costs either insurance companies government. people vaccinated young healthy.

I'm young healthy partially vaccinated. point care much fairly careful whole thing. Yea, one suing anyone $80. good nothing lazy bum insured working. /s Republicans. mean, open stuff, wearing masks keeping distancing seems like reasonable thing numbers creeping back can’t snap fingers instantly everyone vaccinated. 90% according CDC Mederna Pfizer. understand much virus last summer. Last summer yes kind necessary. Hardly anyone alive something like “get it”. 

But it’s year half. need “experts” fucking come now. Enough hedging double talk. actually surprised post  I’m struggling understand seeing increasing covid cases US people receiving vaccine (plus fact many people gotten COVID already). simply states opened gen pop? would think younger age segments true spreaders.

PS. I’m believer vaccines isn’t written intention understate amazing vaccines distributed Well quantify that? friend Vancouver tested positive Sunday. vax. temp went 99.2. Light cough. That's it. effects nil. So... Well veganism works that's care :) vaccine administered work Walgreens January. asked insurance information, told $50 administration fee. Insurance companies say something covered isn’t, refuse pay. dispute them, frustrating experience even you’re 100% right pay out. Brilliant analysis. Agree completely. 30 percent students die

[So according 545,751 deaths involving Covid, 258 aged 0 17. idea far ""30% students"" are? absurd thing say. Az J&amp;J appointment tomorrow, choice, I'd get qualms whatsoever. pandemic still raging, we're talking single digits million severe side effect death vaccine, vs. orders magnitude higher risk death hospitalization next year disease itself. It’s becoming clear states likely going struggle get 50% vaccinated, others going hit 80%+. Multiple theories

A. plain true. Information get distorted easily even without intentional distortion.

B. Bad vaccine batch (if worked together could vaccinated together)

C. asymptomatic/very mild. vaccine work level... didn’t know free went anyway cause want nonsense done hope everyone gets It’s pretty ridiculous. CDC’s decision definitely going harm good. State? available? Sorry I’m mobile, fixed link  realize many people need get vaccine find something like this? Like medications problem good chance never know it. Exactly! People dont believe covid real probably already got uncle JimBob's Superbowl party. skeptics want cant deny antibodies (unless get measles immune system resets). -_- wonder maybe correlation interactions birth control? Like moderate bad cold reason we're ahead EU population first dose total doses per 100 people.

Marinho's research found shockingly high number children babies affected February 2020 15 March 2021, Covid-19 killed least 852 Brazil's children age nine, including 518 babies one year old, according figures Brazilian Ministry Health. Dr Marinho estimates twice number children died Covid. serious problem underreporting due lack Covid testing bringing numbers down, says.

 Marinho calculated excess deaths unspecified acute respiratory syndrome pandemic, found 10 times deaths unexplained respiratory syndrome previous years. adding numbers, estimates virus fact killed 2,060 children nine years old, including 1,302 babies.

… Yup. matter brief pause, damage done. previous years? anticipated incidence roughly single digits per *million* individuals Astrazeneca blood clotting

Don't think say sure everyone, age groups/genders etc, unless know better PEI Germany, health authorities Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Switzerland, etc...

They stop using reason 60 age group Germany really wish posts go way minimise risk, would make clear really know exact incidence rate people might inflate incidence blood clots.

Afaik MI 10,000,000, PA 13,000,000 London 8,500,000 300 children died US. People look number think it’s big deal, it’s binary situation. It’s like 300 died every kid fine. 300 died heck lot almost died hell lot got sick experience repercussions. People need aware serious respiratory cardiac damage kids.

They also vectors infections people. 

Finally, it’s like opened flood games suddenly started testing 0-17. They’ve creeping trials downwards age, extending cohort shown serious ill effects. I'd watch Pay-Per-View. looks odd. CDC said 5,800 cases among fully vaccinated people. 290 RI population 1 million people sounds off. wants lift early June. middle may, 60% fully vaccinated, hopefully pull Israel corresponding drop incases. fine, exact location. group makes 80% deaths 80% vaccinated. 

That’s milestone. around 6000 much smaller Poland. Priority extra doses get EU sites seems vaccines either work flawlessly work small percentage people. Almost middle ground partial protection. also went entire week 1,000 deaths every day America big, Europe small Interestingly, two points intertwined. 

Fauci cdc said masks needed scientific evidence recently work, fomite transmission problem, public wearing masks would actually increase transmission. 

It wasn’t cdc realized fomite transmission rare cdc Fauci able recommend mask use then, even though science didn’t yet say masks helped, knew didn’t hurt. begs question medication free america? try imply there's link, without technically lying. generate clicks. agree, although I’d happily AZ jab one offered me, I’d pick J&amp;J one anything it’s one done. Yeah, agree. Fuck, virus well designed...  I'm maskless single shot absolute unit moderna vaccine I'm Alabama, overall one worst states uptake.

However, still silver linings, even data.

Thru today, 66.8% 75+ least taken one dose.

The 65-74 y/o demographic 61.4%.

It drops significantly there, 40.3% 55 - 64 y/o group 17.1% 16 - 54 y/o group.

We extended eligibility everybody week ago, bad signs:

Way many vaccine appointments available way many places without bunch takers.

Overall, we're 29.4% state population taken one dose.

There people still getting vaccinated, going slow. I'm beginning think somewhere mid-sixty percents picture end 65+ crowd, proportionately less age goes down. expect we'll see lot young people catch becomes on-demand convenience thing rather schedule appointment thing. Well yea depends demand. people dont want get vaccinated cant forced to. Restrictions lifted soon possible though enough time passed everyone wants vaxxed. cant see reason shouldnt mother nation considers us evil! thanks!! problem using transmission rates masks lower that. Lockdowns UK formally tied transmission rates, obviously used decisions, saw went: Transmission rates low enough end lockdown, without lockdown transmission rates went back up, back lockdown. I’m saying kids major medical concerns, wouldn’t want get exposed. Student may contagious even aren’t sick, Student B-C might get it, Student could spread others parents home. I’m overly cautious it. class gone year without kids getting sick quarantined didn’t want start now. Besides show symptoms within 2-3 days school (so Sat Sun) quarantine anyway. Well yup. pretty mixed message. people skeptical probably listening reputable information sources begin with. need figure get positive message front people's noses. ""expert"" getting shots continuing wear two masks avoiding indoor public places message. take time get used normalcy again. 

If around vaccinated people risk low, even J&amp;J vaccine effective mRNA ones.

I would suggest taking time slowly increasing expose others. That’s reassuring. Considering kinds considering COVID pretty much nothing kids, vaccines cause rare diseases go them. becomes questionable age beneficial get vaccination. Since New Hampshire conservative receive fraction blowback Texas got ending mask mandate know several people, included, allergic reactions vaccines explicitly told get J&amp;J. appointment week cancelled I’m pretty devastated. list right? counting making here?

Butantan Institute Brazil already produced 40 million doses (Sinovac's), FioCruz Institute already produced 7 millions Russia, Switzerland, South Korea, Brazil South Africa producing doses lag behind five producers chart.

I mean, 45 million higher 18 million UK. vaccine highly effective. go living life, though still following guidelines required. I’m 5 weeks post J&amp;J vax begun seeing friends indoors eating starting last week  85% vaccination

Yeah, we're never getting high vaccination across age groups. Maybe high 60's best I'm much same. Anything gets touched went work me. take chances? I’m 26 childfree. asked hysterectomy 24, doctor said I’m young. asked 25, got told thing. 

Thanks sharing experience. I’ll try ask ablation. take family member doctor week. starting on-site vaccinations Saturday. sure urge see doctor next year get vaccinated booster spot needed. educated ignorant. Plus would go around anyone sick, wether flu cold. 
Now i’m complete idiot, take safety others seriously. I'm good drink bud again, I'll take it. NH. Friends telling getting appointments 3-4 weeks out. everyone eligible, another month two everyone wants vaccination gets first dose. country like Australia? calculations different - risk Covid basically zero. wait Pfizer around 6 - 12 months, country basically put chips AstraZeneca. Looks like reach least 80% stagnation. recommend drink water getting vaccine.

In seriousness, ever get point turn nose free beer, I've gone wrong somewhere life. DEFINITELY putting wagon front horse here, eating J&amp;J pause news stories today potentially needing booster vaccine shots Fall... J&amp;J discontinued, already got J&amp;J shots allowed get booster shot mRNA one? J&amp;J used us got J&amp;J longer feel comfortable don’t want get booster J&amp;J, would able get booster shot one ones? Probably aren’t answers yet, insight would helpful ease anxious mind. Thank you! I'm thinking part reason strong reactions among pretty high percentage people close booster initial shot. boosters apart.

That's speculation, course. called josh brother, object needs removed.

Also stated point opposite worried cost vaccine people getting paying taxes

So? matter receive vaccine not, taxes matter person worrying cost pays part income purchases state? First, obvious joke flown individuals heads question importance brought regards comments thread stated. Obviously vaccine ""free free,"" average individual understands governments use taxes run actions taxes receive technically free, individuals like point stuff government free stating already known. mention OP responding to, probably works home. gotten cold either, since started full time WFH last year. getting sick workplace (office) big driver fewer people getting flu colds past year No? would worried sure he's saying ""likely"".

A reason could saying sell extra vaccines, least get extra contracts looking booster vaccine. I'm saying case better safe sorry. think people like wearing masks public creepy Usually sub prefers put flair required. several Covid deaths vaccinated individuals. vaccine 100% effective preventing serious illness, huge red flag pharma giant lying product (shocking know). Less density. Biden's original stated goal 100M doses 100 days. We're close 100M doses *per month* 100 days. mean grade schools able make students wear masks? able get appointment Pfizer vaccine. wanted Moderna, seemed safer. worried? It’s like 20% fully vaccinated 56% received least one dose. about: mandatory older 50? New Hampshire 56% vaccinated it’s somewhere around Israel’s level vaccination. honestly think it’s time I’ll interested see results can’t get head around: vaccinated get COVID mildly, mean always get mildly? (Whenever get it). It’s clear. 74 people died, obviously got within specific time frame (and time frame quite short haven’t live vaccines long yet). virus stay, ‘guaranteed’ get mildly, vaccine, means 0.0001% chance still dying whatever, might get magnified amounts times get exposed virus, eventually catch severely.
All numbers seem meaningless becomes clear whether one can’t catch severely, repeated exposure it. make sense?  thats eyes Israel, Usa Uk reach 75% vaccinated give shit anybody New Hampshire, find weird they'd end mask mandates instead line month people vaccine mentioned. Donald Trump's daughter got vaccine posted met hate. kind headline makes inclined towards antivaxers agenda Interesting moral conundrum. However, everything reasonable power prevent infecting town southern Baptists getting vaccine properly wearing mask long government required it, anti-science jackasses still suffered outbreak due poor risk analysis skills disbelief reality, I'd say ethically responsible. Blame covid. I'm rural TX, big multi-county vaccine hub county participated closing due significant drop demand. started vaccinating January got waiting list beginning April. Every adult wants vaccine get one here. looks like everyone multi-county region wanted one got one. shut mass vaccine hub, people decide want vaccine find pharmacy administering them. mean, administer thousands thousands vaccines January April. terms populations covered counties combined? Vaccine coverage still low here, many people opted out. J&amp;J efficacy seems increase time, limited data efficacy 40+ days looked strong. trial also conducted partially South Africa particularly difficult variant seems broadly lost transmissive variants. 

So large feel safe, feel even safer reach 50 day mark. cant, cause study worthless add variants J&amp;J extremely good protecting severe illness. would go life normal possible, I'm hoping little week J&amp;J fully effective. likely keep wearing mask public transport (until total case number goes down, quite high moment vaccine demand still high), mask coming state mandate removed. look beyond article saying.

If need booster shot always medical people cautious saying need maintain level covid mitigation. idea needs torpedoed immediately...  It’s supposed June actually. looked severe symptoms. test people see mild asymptomatic infections. thought pretty well-known. 

it's tell us people could still catch spread virus vaccination.  That’s Pfizer brain dead fuck... Endemic virus laughs futile masks pharmacy's get freezers -80C? Yeah EU really promised underdelivered. I’m honestly sure cocky supply. concerts sport people? banned least 2 years.

students schools depends numbers infections+your leaders

everything else: leaders They're certainly morally superior UK sent 800.000 shots covid free Australia thousands people dying every day. That’s don’t understand people saying don’t mask outside. can’t step foot outside without immediately seeing someone, within feet someone. see, take ""get free flu shots"" coupon Walgreens get every single year work since started working, never worry risking it. read Religions Resist that’s probably even accurate. see, lots sites specify one dose fully vaccinated. mask distance flu season near newborns older people? Wow! Id suggest blurry line public scientists media. calculated crude death rate one agencies reporting deaths age incidence age mortality rate calculated. may hinge definition young. counting people 18 49. Good point! J&amp;J much stable Pfizer Moderna reasonable temperatures. Still huge logistics challenge though. Pfizer similar risk clotting according UK data. Norway part EU's vaccine procurement program regards pretty much %95 efficacy tested limited number people phase-3 studies. multiplicative community protection. enough number people vaccinated, number easily get %100. %95 number personal protection, phase-3 studies done vaccinating whole society evalutaing effects potential herd immunity. That's phase-4 experiencing now, Israel example shows %100 effective given enough people (~%60-65?) vaccinated. wonder theory could find way combine flu shot covid shot single shot make even easier people. Vaccination elderly, especially living nursing homes. probably going dependent global spread. That's what's driving variants erode vaccine efficacy. Suppression measures going turn important many Western countries choose acknowledge global vaccine regime required slow mutation rate. expect take time either things happen, especially global vaccination likely means breaking patents/IP protections around MRNA vaccines. agree remember Israel lockdown like UK caseload much lower. much fewer breakthrough cases US.  Massholes heading home quickly. Conversely, everyone die COVID ""ok"" can’t go way protect elderly - lived life already- year 
It’s even fda approved yet
I evaluate phase 3 trials completed. then, scared high risk person, stay away let everyone else live get herd immunity depends R value UK variant masking. Measles contained 75% vaccination (for vaccine gives almost 100% sterilizing immunity). It’s definitely possible. It’s also possible cases low year won’t need booster. main concern availability. gonna another shit show getting booster available flu shot then? Gotcha, understand now, agree. no, waste money re-vaccinating everyone easier? Question people got J&amp;J vaccine, 

How confident somewhat going back normal (obviously follow rules), less stressed Covid? 
Does lower efficacy rate cross mind? 
Do feel like it’s Covid you?

The reason I’m asking I’m fully vaccinated J&amp;J, we’re surge state, extremely careful whole. actually high risk, reason feel like can’t really shake anxiety catching Covid end long term effects.. also lower efficacy rate back mind.. fears ridiculous? 

I want see everyone approaching this, think need little encouragement lol. go, since apparently can’t use Yeah people going try force social distancing masking flu shot. Okay, thanks. Honestly though cares get covid vaccination long you’re going get hospitalized vent, long term affects, die. That’s thought point was. you’re safe WORST outcomes. don’t care get sick days long I’m dead permanently damaged it! haha.... sending fire trucks different neighborhood fire they've already arrived scene neighborhood People taking hard stance situation exist yet weighing situation exist yet also that, course. everyone offered vaccine protects serious illness, might bit easier that. %80 protection severe illness instead ~%100 would agree more. comment linking dailymail.co.uk automatically removed source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Loving 69.420 getting closer closer anti vaxxers? Ive relatively careful, got infected 3 weeks ago also got first shot week. I’ll say fact shut entire world kinda asinine work primary care time receive vaccine charts patient provides name/info pharmacy receive pharmacy. Never received one behalf insurance. 

They mostly collect insurance info get small payout they’re offering administering vaccine/using resources also statistical purposes. Chicago bars packed ignoring limits immediately know 13 months limits theater. Limits distancing inside bar restaurant nothing. can't go closed room without mask long periods safe fully vaccinated. Re-opening sends message safe.

Further want limit variants. means continuing minimize infections hit vaccination herd immunity.

Of course regional aggressive reopenings many states mostly make different statement public health.

Chicago, instance, fully open vaccination yet. rest state opened people 65 April 12th. I'd bet May 12th plus 6 weeks pretty much go back normal. goes bars restaurants? People 65.

The CDC overly cautious. Local elected officials delicate balancing act safety ""p-word can't say here"" ramifications caving people like OP. Here's needs happen: Explicit messaging way end mask mandates, restrictions, social distancing get vaccinated. Period. running around double masks. Officials need make clear believe vaccines work. encourage people get vaccine. no, coercion going work, either. disparity part vaccinations initially offered healthcare workers elderly, groups disproportionately composed women. also likely reflects longstanding patterns men engaging riskier behavior paying less attention health women, experts say. 9 staff recently got covid19 despite fully vaccinated Moderna Ontario

Clearly, would better 7M people could communicated better still seems pretty reasonable number given logistics. Japan election rig. Naturally, Coronavirus met appropriate concern there

Another nice milestone 30% American adults *fully* vaccinated. expect one three end week.

But never hurts call doctor check you’re concerned :) Canada took doses got COVAX think fair, also given way money COVAX Curious, could 3rd dose alone able protect multiple, divergent variants?

For example, certain strains one set mutations cause immune vaccine evasion (E484K variants plus hypothetical future mutations), strains different strains original ones different set mutations (E484Q, L452R, hypothetical future mutations), would 3rd dose mrna dose cover that? Realistically vaccine vs COVID...this pandemic never really reach herd immunity, way large majority population either vaccinated infected. guess say I’ll hunker down, people that’s best viable option - service based economy interacting others huge part jobs.

Oh, I'll fix it. I'm case! wrong. Sucks suck. Youre assigning risk hypothesis though same, not. Youre logic asserts:

There risk world 3 occuring hasnt happened falsifiable say is.

Aliens havent visited since cant prove exist do, risk happening literally 0.

I face risk loss bet Bengals winning superbowl, ""the bengals could someday"" falsifiable, never witnessed cannot say chance. 

Youre completly right, claims make valid hypothesis. look evidence prove wrong. also completely wrong. claim fits framework scientific method mean reasonable use statistical setting. fact falsifiable claim *can* proved wrong means definition, risk. would need manage prove claims risk away, fact thay women got prove men cannot get it. fact youre asserting ""men cannot get clora covid"" requires scientific process implies still risk factor men. hypothesis also built assumptions limited information, questionable begin with. less information, cases, studies, test, less confidence speak regarding risk. say risk zero pretty damn weighty claim. said risk zero, whether like not, look circumstances, precedent, similar cases, say things like 'we cannot immediately count something almost genetically identical human woman get yet, look deeper say sure. exactly uncommon things happen women happen men.

All say, ""there zero risk men women clots far"" scientifically laughable.

Thats like saying breast cancer isnt huge problem general for men lifetime risk of diagnosed with breast cancer is 1 833 women 1 8 chance. means general population risk diagnosed breast cancer around 1:420. Doesnt sound horrible like 1:8, it.

You cant ignore differences sex, age race. doesnt mean shouldnt investigate something affects men, cant group everyone together say ""yeah, thats risk"". might taking higher chance unwillingly dying taking vaccine.

It's likely personal choices also playing degree, big factor might appear first. contradict myself, countries ineffective lockdowns still much easier economy nothing mean lockdowns bad, means countries incompetent poor leadership buckles much idiotic pressure.

Just reiterate, lockdown always much harder economy there's Covid (there's year clear evidence that) saying government incompetence means proven-to-be-right strategy so.

I'm trying come argumentative, sounds lot like *We know vaccines, even though effective, actually prevent spread*. seems like yet another reason continue put life hold indefinitely. now, evidence suggest future variant negate vaccine's ability keep people hospital, goal this. I’m talking vaccine uptake. Sure thing is: shrunk since last check good see! Nope, 2 weeks: say absolutely false contradict acknowledging countries effective lockdown procedures.

Your true Scotsman approach lockdowns invalidate reality majority world bad kind lockdown initial argument apply. really put blind eye issue. 🤦‍♂️I'm still thinking early Olympics happen, postpone 2022 Hive mentality people parroting false information common Reddit unfortunately.

As fun fact Canada actually giving 1st doses per capita US right now. 

Though partially Canada choose delay second doses. However studies Astra Zeneca effective longer time doses it'll interesting see affects things later summer. add this, DOH great resource general you’re uninsured. definitely go others, least vaccinate keep stitched best ability. 

Your comment offering vaccines- read vaccinating hep b hiv, made google hiv vaccine?! turns out, 2 days ago, determined novel hiv vaccine safe effective... wow! That’s awesome. Get hep c we’ll roll. He’s wrong LOL I’m Europe CONGRATS!!! finished second Moderna shot. Lets keep going. Sure, gap may ever close fully, remain disparate long either. EU US 7 weeks ago, rate vaccination/deliveries quickly increasing (it is) still EU US now, 4 weeks time. Future weeks past weeks different “behind” ambiguous ones referred to. still effective severe disease death we're trying prevent. roommate got covid :(. Thankfully got vaccine, 1 week ago (J&amp;J) worried be? avoid home much possible? Keep windows open? Well, clots think AZ J&amp;J would significant problems.

AFAIK UK AZ Pfizer performed level. wore mine outdoors relatively crowded area like parking lot. Walking sidewalk passed person every ten minutes, hell no. much reasonable response would send press release saying tell administer vaccine look particular symptoms particular demographic groups rare serious potential side effect data gathered.

This would much long term damage people find CDC already knew complications didn’t inform public.

The pause good news it’s best thing could’ve done. I'm nursing program pharm class learned even otc meds take without thinking *shit* ton possible side effects. Ibuprofen cause heart failure, heart attacks, GI bleeding, hepatitis, Steven Johnson syndrome. life threatening complications still take regularly.

 I'm freaking 2 days vaccine time recognize *very* small risk there's vaccine medication ever can't mess bad particularly unlucky. 

IMO good issues brought light, media bs ""we're gonna die afraid right keep reading articles stay informed"". 

They're like obviously, mean shit, read article healthy 25 year old died 3 months getting vaccine. Funnily enough, never actually said covid vaccine act healthy young people never die. Though start AZ time February. Dec 27th start Pfizer-BioNTech. e figure susceptible clots Oxford JnJ, give Pfizer moderna vaccine. Anyone chance blood clots easily take AstraZeneca vaccine. Let’s give scientists researchers little time. done amazing work far even address issue. hopeful positive outcome. be. term ""booster"" little bit confusing really completely independent vaccine, similar get different flu shot year.

Incidentally there's whole bunch different companies make flu shots different processes seem need stick one company. pfft, one nitrogen atom. can't possibly make difference. where's H2O2? ridiculous argument smells PR. 10% per year get different vaccine, possibly much lower depending progress vaccination campaign (but could also quite higher reach herd immunity vaccinate enough people remain open healthcare saturation - case spread non vaccinated population might end higher) Anytime two things, one them. people talking breaking patents seriously missing boat. patents reason got for-profit companies race vaccine first place. Playing Lucy Football short-sighted strategy screw us next pandemic happens.

And people talking ""research"" publicly funded totally missing boat. years expertise companies like Moderna acquired mRNA vaccines? ""publicly funded""

I want Government attempting make vaccines next pandemic. sounds like nightmare scenario.

Put aside concerns ""fairness"" second, take look process trying create vaccine pandemic disease:

1. government tries create vaccine money, gives public free.
2. government lets private companies make vaccine negotiates price Government pay. Given urgency situation, Government may also choose subsidize vaccine development, production testing order get vaccine quicker.

3. government thing 2, leaves private companies impression profit happen, expropriates IP vaccine turns useful. Now, one ever trust Government future pandemics, IP rights strongly weakened general, leaving Government 1 option.


Given behavior Government far pandemic, (1) clearly good option. Government consistently underestimated time possible vaccine in, would likely self-fulfilling prophecy decided try create vaccine themselves. Government scientists ""public health experts"" consistently cast doubt mRNA technology likely would've chosen different tech created vaccine themselves. Government mostly total disaster urgency needed. thank you.


(2) clearly better option (1), clearly save lives get economy back running, people want try disingenuous (3) inevitably lead (1) option future.

Of course companies make profit. make much bigger profit lol, Government offered massive prizes companies quickly made effective vaccine. small price Government pay vaccines minuscule compared massive economic benefits vaccinated population.

""The Government funded it"" justification ""there profit"" unless someone actually believes Government would able make vaccine itself. masks king time ever notice tinnitus I’m going sleep. fall asleep rain sounds something similar playing. probably sleep better complete silence anyway. Canada, starting become ""not take AZ vaccine (or J&amp;J receive it) get vaccine all"", vaccines entering country AZ. believe point 14 isn’t magic number. people might little longer, people little less perhaps. 

It’s like 100% people immune systems go “hey! It’s 14 days we’re 96% safe now!”

There variability there, means massive sample size tens millions vaccinations you’re going people take little longer “full” immunity develop exactly CDC says do.

Restaurants gyms still high risk. Hanging friends, inside, without masks still high risk.

The CDC still recommending wear mask, keep 6 feet apart, limit time indoor spaces.

One thing know yet people get infected vaccinated get long covid organ damage finding non-vaccinated, asymptomatic people. risk I'm willing take.  Thank you, great! necessarily need them, use they're still safe, used preservative. lots people become hesitant misinformation years. without calm nerves. Hyperbole. 

Kretschmann got shot weeks ago.
They privileges treated common populace  ^(fuck yeeeah) AZ contracted use license Oxford's vaccine mass-produce it, since UofOxford can't exactly produce millions doses vaccine short notice. create vaccine, make it. Oxford's research publicly funded because, get this, public research institution. 

Thanks that, Britain pretty much never vaccine shortage like rest EU did, nevemind world sans Russia China. That's sweet deal, honestly. country keeps getting stiffed shipments Sinovac Pfizer, shipments get delayed cancelled. Seeing what's going Europe depressing. Living US, reassuring extent decay internally selfishness, Europe shit together. passing day, seems they're going path US....just better infrastructure, education, wealth equality healthcare. Posted r/covid19 weekly thread yesterday haven’t gotten response going post well:

Someone told different thread earlier solid evidence Pfizer vaccine elicits stronger t-cell response moderna vaccine. Granted haven’t seen whole lot either them, little seen relatively recent comparing two implies t-cell response similar. Given similar regards far, safe assume pretty similar elicited t-cell response well? Thanks! wonder would even matter certain amount time passes. example, idea makes flu shots one seems care shot get flu season rolls around. Exactly compare apples apples look cases period article unvaccinated. let’s say (example purposes only) 120,000 cases 220M unvaccinated people. 

And take reciprocal (5800/77M / 120,000/220m) 14%

Meaning efficiancy real world 1-0.14 86%

again estimated/made figures Quick!

Put Covid pause! think also need keep mind parts world, AZ option people access Pfizer/Moderna highly unlikely. family country widespread COVID hope anything AZ, vaccine hesitancy becoming real issue due concerns clots. types studies/comparisons actually quite helpful many.  Thank sharing this! Since last week it’s confusing cause general practitioners also vaccinating. depends - always - individual German state. states faster, states slower. Canada right now, time first second shots Pfizer vaccine stretched 4 months due supply.. Well promising. imagine combined vaccinated literally invincible.

&amp;#x200B;

in seriousness amazing news. cannot wait get approved distributed worldwide. see possible. may something closer like 30-40% lifetime risk infection depending pandemic plays old are.

This seems insanely optimistic me. flu vaccines 5-20% people catch flu every year, vaccines reducing chances catching 40-60%. covid vaccines effective reduces community spread, covid also vastly infectious begin with. normal vaccines need metals them? antibodies vaccine would outcompete body's innate immune response common cold occurs would make tougher body fight normal viruses.

I know there's validity that. ingredients mRNA shots safest we've ever used. preservatives, metals, food grade lipids, salts, sugar mRNA instruction.

Well, there’s PEG-2000, cause allergic reactions, even anaphylaxis some. Yup like 1 30,000 death like 1 10,000 hospitalization side effects versus 1 100,000 COVID probably 10x lower account social distancing/masking 1 1mil. Asking someone take 30x increase risk benefit selfish, way around countries implemented alternative vaccines women age 30 risk/benefit favor unlike every demographic group. Please state nature medical emergency  CDC recommendations line point 1. fully vaccinated can't go gym train unless entire class vaccinated (I'm combat sport masks would get torn off). No. not. contains cold virus programmed release spike protein matches spike protein coronavirus. need get world vaccinated asap everyone privilege hoard everything like US. There's many places AZ available.                                           don’t understand there’s discussion **who** get **which** vaccine. understand it, blood clot issue isolated young women...so change recommendation say category people get different vaccine. Done.   Nah probably not. idea cases super low everyone already level immunity, even gold standard 95% currently see right Pfizer/Moderna.  girl might've died fully informed.

The problem blood clots equal deaths, vaccinated person know watch certain symptoms he/she might go hospital help, late. normally go hospital 102F fever unless sustained... vaccine side effects go away within 24-48 hours, I'd give long unless he's serious pain discomfort. begs question antibody tests prevalent? Democracy democracy. 

Democracy never meant moral, whatever people want. 

My two cents. 

If people want restrictions, shall restrictions. still catch vaccine lol *that* rare that's entirely true, though agree always people risk-averse ever agree dropping it. However undeniably reached anything close heard immunity, even really reach (another debate) thus people wanting threshold general population phobic. 

The cdc guidelines say vaccinated person, gather 1 household unvaccinated people. seem overly cautious say that's case probably getting rid mask mandates public yet. time goes get people vaccinated masks removed based safe mix vaccinated &amp; unvaccinated folks, no? scientific evidence wearing mask outdoors. None. Ziltch. Nada. They're counting incidents clots Covid infections v vaccine. asymptomatic clot therefore nothing count?!! tell coped? Look original comment, whining anything. saying exercising outside always feasible live. one responded me. fucking hate boss.

I even work hate too, asshole. Please. guess probably think better getting natural immunity especially since get flu every year. getting vaccine really different immunity get getting flu.









That said, necessarily keep getting severe case flu. reduces chances still get severely despite vaccination. Also, get flu shot early season, late season shot got could ineffective still get severe case. said, they're getting better flu shot effective variations early season shot good whole season years. 










Regardless, still worth getting opinion. freaking hate flu covid covid?  Yeah can't find quote matches headlines articles. planning future possibilities different variants. That's light clunky. Im thinking concrete work maybe. does, vector immunity doesn’t stay consistent, wanes time that’s possibly reason AZ’s vaccine effective longer dosing interval. J&amp;J might find providing booster, say, year later negates vector immunity issues. Same. BF made appointments two us, him, probably never would gotten vaccinated. I'm working, young health conditions, figured worth $100+ cost getting done (since tests supposed free ended paying like $120 times) never got flu shot flu so. Fear motivate me. recover stop taking them? I’ve used PPIs GERD past 2-3 months tinnitus right ear 3 weeks now. quote third paragraph article:

“We need see would sequence, often need that, remains seen,” told CNBC’s Bertha Coombs event CVS Health. “A likely scenario likely need third dose, somewhere six 12 months there, annual revaccination, needs confirmed. And again, variants play key role.”

“It extremely important suppress pool people susceptible virus,” Bourla said.

Here's video says it: ask people questions. get met response ""oh bad man wants bad thing happen people die? want people die you?"" every time tell outrage generator is

Of course nobody ever responds would force people actually think opinions reasons hold want criticize it? Go local council meeting write politicians come reddit whine fucking lame. idea permanent ""COVID zero"" situation always pipe dream. highly contagious brand new virus animal reserves. COVID around forever. vaccines going allow us mostly ignore time get booster point keep antibody levels high keep herd immunity around. Lol Pfizer said another shot needed around 12 months .. also becomes like flu shot- look % population actually receives one yearly...it around 45-60% that’s certain instructions requiring one mostly young kids n elderly  source hormone pill comment? wonder they’ll eventually start titers can't find actual quote says this. quite directly statement. 

“It extremely important suppress pool people susceptible virus,"" Nope They're spread air, similar COVID, diseases caused viruses. Viruses fragile die surfaces, bacteria survive surfaces. sure I'm one high horse? one seems think people incapable gathering information through, dunno, radio, newspapers, talking friends &amp; family... god wonder anyone survive world WITHOUT looking them! Please safe, need you! Yup. It’s ridiculous here. zero problem putting one go store store requires refuse wear one outside walking such. I’ve yelled across street put one on. It’s insane. less ""majority"" ""herd immunity.""

But wearing mask group folks know vaccinated. Partly cultural difference think. UK politicians - imagine it’s Germany - least pretend they’re important public servants like teachers nurses. Special treatment kind goes like lead balloon. think also massive difference role UK PM German chancellor play systems compared US president. don’t anywhere near personal power, least theory. nope, ceo pfizer fact say ""“A likely scenario likely need third dose, somewhere six 12 months there, annual revaccination, needs confirmed. again, variants play key role,” told CNBC’s Bertha Coombs event CVS Health."" facts now, right. Time tell.. sure don’t get. given population COVID infections, you’re either symptomatic asymptomatic. 8x’s based symptomatic cases would higher based infected, would include asymptomatic well. You’re “infected” either way. opposite may also true. adverse reactions common second shot, first person covid past. antibodies still body reasonable expect third shot would bad second. Start shipping Canada mexico wait people remove heads ass. Lol Pfizer ceo said another one needed like 12 months. J&amp;J AZ vaccines western world??   Whatever happened to: [Immunity Coronavirus May Last Years, New Data Serious question: least continue wear masks situations? Like flu season public transit, medical professionals always wear coming contact patients (who might unknown infections), even around vulnerable people like grandparents immune-compromised friends? get masks uncomfortable understand people angry mandates really costs nothing wear one, far tell benefit general health worn appropriately reasonably. funny happens let virus run wild political points. Keep good work! Maybe take breath think second. 

Many diseases require booster shots. There's reason would different. BUT, ""the whole point"" keep community spread tiny amount, worry ripping society eliminate restrictions. get shot now, crush number cases tiny amount (like Israel right now), go back normal. could possibly require booster point line keep things normal. Whether sick not, pandemic continues thing that's happening us, vaccine boosters sound like much better option possible lockdowns every years COVID manages come raging back. get feeling like worth trouble ""refusal"" denotes affirmative opposition! maybe edited article 3rd paragraph: ""“A likely scenario likely need third dose, somewhere six 12 months there, annual revaccination, needs confirmed. again, variants play key role,” told CNBC’s Bertha Coombs event CVS Health."" CDC suspend administering COVID-19 analyze data. That's common difference parliamentary democracy presidential one. Neither Chancellor Germany British Prime Minister voted directly people parliament. also much limited powers compared US President French President, even mention Russian President. Executive Orders stuff like Mrs. Merkel, even Commander Chief Armed Forces.

Chancellor Merkel Prime Minister Johnson could removed office day lose backing majority members parliament. mean saw UK bunch times recent years. Without general election lost confidence party Cameron got replaced May, got replaced Johnson. happened Germany, think last time 80s half way term smaller coalition partner Social Democrats Free Liberals switched supported Christian Democratic candidate, making Chancellor. also affected precautions taken weather. Covid ""native"" R0 somewhere 2.5-5 range, wet summer weather cuts 20%. masking cuts further, social distancing more.  taking precautions, even 60% immunity pandemic thin. Ah, good know. ""You get caught there's reason criticize restriction"" Great argument there, smart little guy. Like yesterday? It’s totally normal reaction vaccines. Would go ER fever normally? sort chronic disease makes fever dangerous?

 side effects last 24-48 hours disappear . take Tylenol. probably make feel much better. Yeah, think get it. Many television. cool though, enjoy high horse. number quoted looking infections. adverse effects hospitalizations. It’s page 32 doc linked. Thanks info! really nervous! No. best protection social distancing. case boosters needed. EU already contracts enough doses Pfizer/BioNTech Moderna alone fully vaccinate citizens, top that.  booster shots seem single-shot dose, booster shots meant take kind middling, waning immunity back full immunity, there'd need quarantining. helps little. I'm set shot 2 tomorrow. mild random tinnitus last 5ish years, maybe 4-5x year seconds time. Hardly even thought it. first moderna shot got tinnitus 4-5 days, times day, never happened. Googled found support groups covid covid vaccine tinnitus. there's many people saying there's got bad shot 2 I'm terrified, I'm terrified covid.  Sorry less knowledge... parents diabetes mother takes blood thinners .... already took first dose AZ planning second dose take care ? california opened 16+ too, honorable person am, started looking appointments today booked county cant bothered driving another OH 
MY 
GOD 


you're right!

how get 4K video someone reading information teleprompter?!!

my lord, they'll read 3kb TEXT file without built-in custom fonts!! studies like extremely important, people tend believe first thing read. live people vaccinated. top expert pandemic said Sunday that Israel may reached “a sort herd immunity” could safely ease restrictions. Eran Segal, computational biologist Weizmann Institute Science, told Channel 12 ***with Israelis immunized, even reopening swaths economy gatherings Purim Passover holidays contributed spike cases.*** information sub, I’m pretty disappointed people whining here. Yes, it’s inconvenient, yes needles scary, etc etc etc, immune system won’t able protect 6 months so, hence booster. continued immunity provided getting vaccinated schedule. probably going get shot yearly minimum (just like getting flu shot). thankful vaccines... Epecially since effective contagious dangerous new variants.

My father couldn’t get shot time protect year (age group). likely unknowingly Covid getting vaccinated, place figure exposed trip hardware store days before. Tested positive yesterday, fever horrible cough last 4 days - fever won’t budge. It’s extremely worrying.

If lucky enough second dose plan whining thread get third one six months, keep unwanted opinions yourself. extra argument use Pfizer/BioNTech EU? Use expensive vaccines rich countries, cheap vaccines poorer countries. thats almost guaranteed. j &amp; j supply issues supposed last 2 weeks think, would surprised wasnt reapproved probably talk doctor. access telehealth service? Yeah made sure knew getting second shot said yeah it’s fine. Kind concerning isn’t case. It’s smaller pharmacy. big chain anything. Hope place legit... wanted anyway. faced repercussions yet still felt need complain. textbook whining. created strawman play victim. like caricature k  aren. bad. Next pandemic well turn island far away everything else uncommon missing world maps. I’d rather people enough integrity admit wrong keep harmful course. dumbest analogy think I've ever heard.

Get vaccinated. agree comment, thought I’d mention 61% figure UK adults only. we’re looking total population percentage currently 48% (compared 38% metric US). think point USA's self interest start releasing AZ J&amp;J rights countries want and/or donate.

To someone get vaccine fall earliest, 1/1,000,000 odds getting dangerous treatable blood clot absurdly low risk, especially 60+ high risk death get covid. someone probably pick choose vaccine month, they'll want mRNA vaccines less known side effect risks probably higher efficacy infection variants.

The biggest long term risk USA completing vaccine campaign, move persuasion kids soon, imminently. Instead, covid develop variant gets country booster safely developed deployed. Less covid world reduces risk.

Or, like dominos, variant takes China, South Korea, Vietnam, eventually spread rest world threaten America. government mandating things like n95's double masking clearly actually concerned spread make be, theater criticized. crime spree community. need double number police every street protect you, also see anyone breaking rules make sure report them. anxious worry nothing worry committed crimes **Affiliation:** Southern Illinois University Edwardsville, Department Applied Communication Studies

**End Date:** June 30, 2021  think we're going crack 90%, I'd find surprising

I disagree reasons. First, age demographic tends medical supervision often enough encouraged one one providers get vaccinated. 

Second, numbers indicate group still getting vaccinated high rate considering 20% remain initiate process. current rate, they'll 90% month. course slow I'm saying month, still lot momentum. 

Third, obviously highest risk group messaging around clear beginning. big asshole would suggest elderly relatives get vaccine? (By way, know one instance, yes son live giant asshole imagine. Also disinformation Lupus--the mother--and GBS--the father--means get vaccinated. told ask doctor. GBS bit dicey still reason go unvaccinated [as understand Anyway, plan smuggle mom get vaccinated.)

Finally, think general unwarranted pessimism numbers eventually get vaccinated. We've reached greater 90% population vaccines hopefully COVID vaccines well. demand definitely down, temporary supply issue caused 80% drop j &amp; j doses delivered production hiccup obviously administration pause affects 20% Thats like saying Crack 10x likely cause heart attack bad cocaine. Probably better cocaine. Maybe stick vaccines arent causing blood clots. Color year \[drum roll\]... know even talking point. comments nothing article discussed; like random outrage generator.

No Brain Rot ? New data suggests vaccination effective. first time population 39 years old younger people ICU people aged 70 over. already happening. tourist town Alaska vaccinating anyone wants one fly in. wonder risk blood clots certain medicines birth control? report states Pfizer vaccine almost likelyhood clotting well though? 5 million (AZ) vs 4 million 


* 480,000 people receiving COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (Pfizer Moderna), CVT occurred 4 million.
* CVT reported occur 5 million people first dose AZ-Oxford COVID-19 vaccine. Many people side effects flu shot, still get every year. feeling kinda crappy day way better getting flu - COVID. get must stock J&amp;J something

This proves want actual conversation. say work. asked acting like works. believes works wants vaccinated individuals take masks off. One disagree disagree actually said, reported said. problem parents forcing children drink it. heard kids late month. don’t quarantine don’t symptoms yet. 

Which ignores fact kids often asymptomatic, don’t get sick spread others okay. think there’s “any chance” we’ll able sit inside library “this year”? weird way phrasing that, yes think chances pretty high you’ll able within month, maybe two, Us new things called cities, cheeky Sumerians got around inventing millennia ago. Better watch CNN sue trying take job/schtick. pandemic unfairly targeting stupid. Mom got second shot two weeks ago. Dad got first last week. got first today. Moderna. Things looking up. media 200 times likely cause needless concern chaos included many lives saved vs killed take vaccine. 
Let's start publishing positive side news instead trying raise panic get readers viewers cost mental health humans. Douche canoes... mind boggling thing people afraid vaccinated take nonsense. OR, get pfizer moderna vaccine avoid both? course? 

I'm US wife still gotten dose yet. get instead send somewhere else?  vaccine cards going need bit bigger. don’t think it’s given everyone second shot. You’ll probably lose 10 20% people, right? 

Everyone commenting effectiveness one shot… even bothering second shot that’s true?

See also: still head state. see can't jump line without controversy. want make conspiracy theories come true probably help start civil war, sure. *This* fucking scares you? virus killed million people, vaccine killed *maybe* one person? 
 
I'm sorry, I'm fucking done people. just... cannot even point. got moderna shot 4/13. called pharmacist today schedule second shot said come today (4/15). seem right? thought I’m supposed wait 28 days get second shot? new information this? exact number hard pin down. 

But lot documented cases it. linked article links survey studies it. again, that's most-risky outdoor activities mostly banned. goal isn’t zero cases zero risk. COVID endemic it’s going anywhere.

Of course? never said otherwise. Although Obviously expect community spread COVID lot lower enough people vaccinated. We'll safer alone. comparison, flu kills 33 167 Americans per day annual basis driving crazy. see pause J&amp;J first thought ""well going help case anti-vaxxers,"" priorities way base. actual safety vaccine important winning argument group never accept evidence fit biases. 1. Young healthy people die hospitalized too. 

2. Kids people health conditions can’t get vaccine depend others get it. Anyone doesn’t get vaccinated puts risk. 

3. spreads greater chance mutates form evades vaccines. 

4. don’t know long term effects Covid. unique damage brain, heart, lungs, there’s chance could lead serious problems like heart attacks later on. Yeah, really surprising see pause. can't understand considering climate in. Israel's stats kind telling us herd immunity closer 60% thought 75%? Yep, think CDC came said 1 10,000 chance catching covid via surface transmission. people get shots problem. Pretty simple. Encouraging hear too, though noticeable, usually able ignore it.

No point getting worked it, would simply pointless. believe live vaccination sites start close well. I’m ignoring them. study one comparing basis blood clots that’s I’m responding to. selling point shouldn’t I’m likely get blood clot covid versus getting vaccine. doesn’t make want take particular vaccine all. starting AZ vaccine type saga US. J+J pulled less five days ago. willing take chances here.

But young woman clotting disorder maybe be. that's reason pause, identify specific demographic risk, advise appropriately. People mad FDA 1 1.1 million chance develop blood clot J&amp;J vaccine based available data. comparison, birth control pills 1 1000 chance causing blood clots women. 

It moral thing let people know *exceedingly* rare side effect, rare, halt distribution, let people make decision themselves. likely die car crash die COVID Christ's sake. complete wrong move drastically negative consequences rest world since easiest vaccines distribute requires one dose. indoor seating issue due air circulation COVID-19 airborne. Nothing fomite(surface) transmission. people wipe chairs would bit pointless.  Hey! I'm 43. callin' old? public health officials, well intentioned, failed appreciate bad people grasping one million chance really means behavior, advised caution saw something like blurry shadow pattern, inadvertently caused many people die vaccine hesitancy whole post dripping with. public health response correct contentious political issue efficiency vaccine rollout instrumental saving lives; covid vaccine, could transparent without causing panic driving people away getting vaccinated together. website turning complete political propaganda site jfc upside respect generally speaking viruses grow increasingly resilient contagious often becoming less deadly time. 

Only ones face large selection pressure become less deadly. That's case COVID. 

It kills small percentage get it, even small percentage weeks transmit it. contagious symptoms asymptomatic people. facing sort strong selection pressure become less deadly.  OCD havers unite! It’s bad year. 

Ironically, fear germs gotten way better. think whole thing’s acted like involuntary exposure therapy. ended depression different compulsions trade off... Part nature sub's visitors. Check post histories sometime--you'll see some... interesting... subs. 6 people short narrow common risk factors patients adverse events. bunch asymptomatic subclinical cases pause (rightly so) longer sort data. Full meaning available people ages (including kids)? Pretty crazy accurate been. something celebrate? depressing. dont think I've worn mask outside entire pandemic completely unnecessary. Got second shot yesterday. boy make feel like shit. didn’t sleep wink. Fevers, sweating, headache, every bone muscle hurt. less 24 hours later starting feel much better. please ban people leaving said places without vaccine? rest sane folks want go back normal :( Fine business  bad scientific thinking. question whether likely develop clotting issue get vaccinated, period. whether issue likely among people confirmed COVID. Many millions unconfirmed cases COVID. Many millions even get COVID 'Cult Cloth'? Get grip, bro. Masks best protection transmitting covid short vaccinations. We're fucking lucky mask could offer protection, ffs I've vaccinated every year life seasonal flu got sick every time I'm definitely taking one gotten sick since 2019 frustration comes kids school day. exposed “supposed” stay home knew whether someone sick. kids could still carry viral load could expose get sick even don’t get sick. district doesn’t give two shits teachers.  Yep. US acquired total 250 million vaccine doses far 20 million J&amp;J, half already used. saw news report yesterday said many uninsured rural areas don’t realize vaccine free. campaign strategy really needs start telling people don’t pay get it. wonder people get vaccinated realize won’t cost anything getting Titers checked instead. course want vaccinate 6 months. make damn product. need video.

It starts block 370M people representing population America. highlights (zooms colors) many already COVID. many serious symptoms. many died.

Then make second block everyone getting vaccinated many people would serious symptoms vaccination. would die it.

Then compare two blocks side side. *science web articles agree me* Oh boy, love taking medical advice big pharma CEO's. Coronaviruses self-correcting mechanism replicating makes mutate far, far slowly flu mutates lot. 

Meanwhile, Moderna already working booster shot variants probably ready early fall. 

Variants probably going huge deal grand scheme things world gets vaccinated. lost enthusiasm get second vaccine shot now. scheduled sad. Good. kid needs stay home awhile even kid negative - hope enforce speak out. No, Government officials Germany priority group 3 (out 3, half population priority group), 60 years old. Merkel group due age job. know developing blood clots brain? show symptoms late? Everyone likely need it. talking people involved conducting Pfizer durability studies, antibody quality remains high (90%+) antibody quantity diminishes half people produce second shot little three months. behavior present even young healthy individuals. Less 10% anywhere &lt;10 one giving figure hang hat on. 

Again, goal isn’t zero cases zero risk. COVID endemic it’s going anywhere. Try looking stress-diathesis model disease India running $20B/month trade deficit huge enough causing devaluation Rupee, changing 50% last decade. puts huge pressures upper middle class enormous political importance face purchasing power stagnation wages. 

I would blame government prioritized domestic vaccination, trade deficit critical keep control want keep key demographic happy. People frustrated number misleading headlines media seems tricked people believing vaccine gives immunity 6 months. people saying, “it’s early, give another month two”, saying thing 2 months.

I understand strawman popular. I'm extremely strict, I've telling people wait months. know what? I'm planning hold first maskless hangout June (starting outdoors, relaxing even more).

Estimated infection rate closer 24% ([80MM ~330M per CDC. little better 1:4 chance caught already. 

Odds probably go next year, people getting vaccinated aggressively exposure also start move us towards herd immunity.
 
On top excellent point, binary choice either. AZ, one safer alternatives (in little bit), nothing. Given odds low catching given month (1:40ish?) probably worth waiting month two pfizer moderna. thing animal reservoirs. it'll keep popping up, probably small, localized flair-ups.

Sit around cry. work out. change life. I'm even sure believe word coming mouth. change convince people vaccinated though. 

government: ""hey instead us using statistics graphs science convince lets treat like children use colorful cartoons celebrities etc."" saying kids higher percentage overall infection number. saying rate infections younger age groups rising. nothing groups' rates infections. saying ""x% total new infections RI age group larger portion infected populace used be"", point. that's article says. probably bad thing, quit reddit I'd news coming would pretty damn unaware even major news items use CNN’s number 77 million fully vaccinated, means percentage still got virus 0.007532%.

I’m still feeling good vaccine. frustrating right thing freakin' obvious can't bothered money. asking question low-quality information allow, got it. That's critical rich countries pour money getting every nation vaccinated. fight coronavirus one win lose human race, one nation. trials say regards first shot? 7 days well? [Well he's address joint session Congress April I'd say see happens then?  5,800 cases / 75,322,283 fully vaccinated people = 0.0077% date ""do"" mean ""fuck"", yes ""do"" data.  virus knows eating. poorly vented 80's construction keep floating around good length time. 54.8% total 54.8% adults?

I’m parroting see Reddit, man. government knowingly giving healthy young women vaccine that’s potentially deadly disease, wouldn’t fuel anti-vaxx crowd?

Committed anti-vaxxers latch onto bad news vaccine. many regular people would lose trust vaccine safety standards scenario above. issue lost trust J&amp;J vaccine versus lost trust vaccines. Well timed message hospitalizations FL rise. thought evidence far suggests increased risk blood clouts limited specific group? stopping everyone? Going current US data 6 cases 7+ million doses administered leaves possibility 0.0001% chance blood clot (assuming 7mil exactly more). 1/1000 chance birth control 0.1% chance.

You’re making bit logical leap data. Healthcare free country anyone 65 (and even everything covered, there's plenty co-pays). really unreasonable people think would free. rare exception. Unless heard prior probably would assume like everything else paid for. pure gold.  going straight Facebook feed anti-vaxxers it. embarrassing, doctor didn’t know free. (I thought thought didn’t know sure) signs health department said insurance card. nervous got that. (I kind insurance pay 100% everything) agree, lot states even giving metrics would take end mask mandates, give lot room premature ending mask mandates. 100% this. miss normal life normal activities, like going gym, travelling, eating out, going theatre, meeting family, practicing ""vain"" self care like getting nails done etc., people portray privileged, ungrateful asshole. shorter lockdown last spring, measures sucked end sight. measures even stricter get worse always extended, feels like there's point following them. imagine many people stopped following rules bother? like anything changes. me, rules seem increasingly pointless increasingly desperate. town, wear mask car member driver's household. So, meet friend, hang maskless day, drives home wear mask 🤪 Maybe there's sensible reason rule, people seems like annoying pointless inconvenience. Dont see ""loan"" bigger amount then. mexican AstraZeneca factory complete utter crap, month delay first doses come incredibly reduced amount like one CDC knows cost-benefit analysis is. According National Safety Council chance dying car accident 1 103. I'm much likely die car accident bad reaction J&amp;J vaccine. vaccines worthless waste time. vaccine herd immunity years out.

Either places get herd immunity inside year, chance thing mutating bypassing vaccines goes high would honestly consider moving middle nowhere starting vegetable farm. words, vaccines massively successful they're supposed do. way said almost made sound like care high risk casual mention (the risk probably low). teasing kind lol

BTW happy cake day actually say that. certainly qualified terms meeting certain criteria. amazing US there's even possibility free. Huh? That's works. increase absolute numbers age cohort versus seen previously. Vaccinations actually help reduce spread cohorts people effectively immune. 20 hospitalizations three deaths among group

That’s worrying... argentina we're getting weird russian ones. They're called sputnik something little digging case. make sign ultimately responsible cost top billing super lazy chasing money insurance. insurance might paid yet could coded wrong, accept insurance agreed bill certain rate pay portion insurance designated.

I’m Canada far guys far number vaccinations go.   need get NASCAR board vaccine requirements. trick! bet 7 million know everything going life constituents Facebook though. Yeah, guess question is: take vaccine risk health stay indoors not? Especially vaccines seemingly don’t issues.

I think think vaccines (ones cause clots rare situations) overall still right thing, also see governments would put hold too. fam side pond took astra zeneca they're fine already caught covid recovered fully. Personally, I’m this. waiting restrictions end. Get it. Demand becoming issue.

80% 65+ gotten it. know immunity granted getting infected, say, July 2020 new variants becoming dominant? pretty much vaccines? There' indeed several reported cases blood clots associated SARS-CoV-2 infections. important thing here, several countries taking account, look risk-benefit taking AZ/J&amp;J vaccines certain populations. know mortality rate elderly population example far exceed risk VIPIT therefore still wise take AZ vaccine population given rarity VIPIT. factor keep mind many developing countries liberty able meet requirements storage mRNA based vaccines.

I've mentioned elsewhere personally agree move several countries taking vaccinating older population (and living countries less developed/unable meet storage requirements mRNA based vaccines) AZ. Furthermore we've seen hospitalisations prevented following one dose AZ 94% there's doubt effective vaccine.

What ultimately comes able provide choice/alternative higher risk groups risk-benefit ratio clear cut. they're extending pause? Either, continuing get administered, discontinued, paused. something three? Hm, yeah, suppose right. That's semantics though. second sentence article quite read:

""Denver Friday move ""Level Blue,"" allows restaurants gyms operate 100% capacity, though six-foot social distancing still place, limiting capacity somewhat."" Can’t get tell employer? literally live boat island lol good argument made medical service public service like fire police service.  much reasons. 

If house catches fire, could set houses on-fire.  catch communicable disease, could transmit neighbors. tell Salvation Army mean, 1 flight attendant every 50 passengers, it’s sometimes hard track everyone onboard It’s kinda weird 18 y/o woman who’s AZ. 

Not aren’t others course, however it’s odd think you’ve vaccine banned across world age group.

Don’t regret second, get vaccine folks. Torn whether get first dose Moderna tomorrow school offering. covid back December I’m 22. Given demand supply still vaccine can’t help shake thoughts someone else get dose instead - literally anyone hasn’t covid older. Pfizer requested authorization 12+ see anything ab fda might review could expect see ruling it? crazy numbers! I'll getting second dose Friday! path known pieces aircraft constantly pieces fall slightly longer path next happen pretty idiotic take dangerous path. guy next know allergic penicillin. Sitting observation peanut butter shot man goes seizures. shitty way find out. Same. Without going far politics (barely possible)... Bolsonaro (their president) want to. think main thing is, know don’t want held responsible causing deaths. can’t really blame covid deaths anyone, people could blame blood clot deaths companies. Politics found college housing people COVID different annex floor. I’m sorry isn’t thread anyone tell floormates risk getting it? don’t share bathroom isn’t central air conditioning building. Yeah wasn’t fun miserable lmao thank body 😂 first Pfizer dose yesterday really aggravated back pain. I’ve dealing sciatica past year half worst flare months last night. immune system respond strange ways. wouldn’t worry much it. AFAIK - giving one two doses, size doses, time them, requirement vaccine ""work"", ""design choice"" made trials. Interestingly dosage shot Moderna Pfizer quite different similar efficacy. Boosters J&amp;J AZ could given well, nothing makes inherently ""one-shot."" get authorization open kids. Dang 103. Nice one. thought dying nearly 101. never changed job advanced company. could probably make 25% made move, listen headhunters interesting offers I’m really happy make enough money anyway. don’t doubt early jumping company company accelerates salary progression, something said working people know respect know respect you. I’m lawyer though recognize different industries different. Yeah everyone’s frothing mouth waiting data smart option. going see huge dip J&amp;J week already. Getting everyone 2 week window get data possible makes sense. Yup! pause necessary unfortunately. Almost hump! fever day seems broken now, headache almost gone. good nights sleep cap off! is, capacity restrictions different distance restrictions. People enter business, can’t anything, leave. Poorer nations higher probability dying Covid, making risk comparison different. fire police insurance thing libertarians want ? Cause yeah sounds like hell deal with. Free? charging $35 pharmacy article says still follow 6 foot distancing, capacity still limited that.

Buttttt point still stands, would imagine official capacities inconsistent social distancing silly say 100% first place. like operate highest capacity kill distancing, dependent individual building instead blanket hard cap %. progress! AFAIK - giving one two doses, size doses, time them, requirement vaccine ""work"", ""design choice"" made trials. Interestingly dosage shot Moderna Pfizer quite different similar efficacy. Boosters J&amp;J AZ could given well, nothing makes inherently ""one-shot."" older family member vaccinated It’s fault, made right call either way. agree skeptical vaccine pushed minority communities. science shown effective even indoors. I’m sorry acceptable line reasoning. Traffic incidents deadly disease never belong level rationale.


I clarified point often enough throughout thread you’re speaking towards issues been. disagree I’ve said you’re disagreeing CDC yesterday today. first shipments J&amp;J literally arrived EU. pause short, going make big difference since little supply moment relative vaccines. long-term EU ordered lot J&amp;J doses, could impact pause lasts long. thought like 5 10 Bulgaria vaccinated already? opened bars clubs?  Waiting Walgreens second shot checking in. :) ...blood clots within brain. DVT serious event, 10-30% diagnosed within months diagnosis, quarter experience sudden death first symptom. 

 type blood clot caused AZ/J&amp;J vaccines occurs within brain even serious.

So yeah, it’s pretty severe side-effect despite rarity. Even come crowd corner minute okay. point scared people need adjust back normal life.  Doc, speculation clots take pathway CVST? Could underlying disease problem? Sinus issues etc? symptoms severe headaches, light aversion vomiting poor woman article had? know things look for? sure you’re aggressive it’s recorded insurance account. 

Everything linked it’s easiest way keep record moment since people get vaccine almost anywhere. actually can’t say future primary’s office won’t get record current patients vaccination pure ease opposed hoping patient wrangle card present future visit. there’s record dose along specific id number well prescribing doctor somewhere digitally saved far efficient. That’s also linked primary who’s also insurance card. 

It’s likely another column added excel sheet. Thank you. I’m anti-vaxx means. didn’t choice vaccines. I’ve trying stay informed possible. Given choice, would definitely choose Pfizer others. appears stable, effective. live USA, AZ wasn’t approved here. Given issues, pauses, I’m thankful that. lot anti-Vaxx here, pause vaccines going add fuel fire. 

After got first does, continued follow guidelines. don’t really care effective might 1/2 vaccine series. end result, least complications goal. vaccines pulling ahead, least problems, best efficacy pushed. Rather trying prop ones aren’t effective. get want get many people inoculated possible, worldwide, getting effective medicine important. parameters study seem strange, they’re addressing mid-point, end point. One dose stop, two dose treatment. want see reactions 14 day window post vaccination. Honestly don’t think it’s unreasonable given theyll lot data since J&amp;J administered less 2 weeks ago. Also gives time study cases side effects see cases count. Best case scenario two weeks large surplus J&amp;J ready ship. Worst case scenario completely ban J&amp;J finish vaccine program maybe 2 weeks month later increased vaccine hesitancy. It’s end world either way suspect won’t much impact people’s opinions. mean places like TX lifted it, tried sue cities keeping them? crediting mandate lifting ignoring efforts stop cities thing, simultaneously celebrating low numbers relative past months cities thing. 

Funny indeed. strayed, recap: supported initial dismissal comparison argument ""adequate"" lockdowns lead ""better economy"".

If take US example lockdown adequate well timed. case US initial comparison still stands. Again, feel free disagree.

That's point. want exact dates much commitments like ""when x happens restriction removed"".

If say May 1st, saying ""fuck it"" people's lives. Instead, say ""when state experiences fewer 100 cases per million week straight, clear going data.

The case data going get better vaccination rates rise, faith that. Especially younger/more risk tolerant folks get shot cut spread. also important people know Covid also sometimes cause CVST, albeit probably rare? know new safe distance social distancing 3 feet, according CDC. yes? could take vacation Sweden. Even complicated 6 perfectly healthy otherwise, seems far, younger. Wise move. Well, yeah. I'm saying eat diet exclusively Twinkies. problem is, Twinkies easy get, packed sugar, probably cheaper healthy meal. clue number need get ,I stop number seemed make sense stop there.

Israel 65% vaccinated natural immunity experts think hit herd immunity. 55% vaccinated good number aim Laugh. [Make] Love... Okay then, risk dying virus 1 : 100 Hey happened replies?

Btw 1 40000 translates 25 1 million. still 4x dealdy.

Maybe luxury choice worth waiting another vaccine that's risk assessment another plane reference people dying, person? love people keep trying cite Florida good example anything.

Number 2 cases today buddy. Archive:  brazil gone lockdown yet? vaccines dangerous. worst risk dying even pessimistic numbers roughly equivalent spending months traffic, importantly lower risk contracting covid dying. Making call delay getting vaxxed bc worried something extremely rare simultaneously maintaining risk something far likely irrational, sorry  true extent, want eating caloric deficit garbage foods though. US Mexico Canada, donated vaccines stockpiled couldn’t use audacity ask Mexico Canada pay US back vaccines could use future. read studies never said things likely rather possible. learned year people horrible reading scientific reports carefully, assessing risk, seperating political tribalism analysis non political things. study January stated 10%.

Problem solved. Yeah, true. state requires insanely low weekly case count reasonable positivity threshold right ""dial 3.0"". executive order requiring counties adhere dial expiring days. top dial changed many times (in fairness, change worked out) assume would dropped counties actually meet current one.

The state roughly 0.75% population receiving first doses daily now. uncommon myth unfortunately. overseas friends (who hear expensive healthcare news probably reddit) first thing asked much costs, told rare time government truly made something free. listened good chunk closing comments. afraid implications giving either go ahead shut answer. Therefore, one woman said send next meeting date sometime Friday, probably next week.

Unless I’m missing something, article doesn’t support argument.  first one best. problem need extreme refrigeration. think passed donating blood, usually fight people Inslee WA, moved 3 counties back phase week.  face county, King move back, changed metrics. science.... rude reply considering put quotes exactly opposite saying. raises great point can’t hear taking personally. Yes is, goes show radicals end spectrum. I’m appalled comments disregarding risk certain group dying, matter small. it’s worth completely agree you. I’ve working home since started, whole family lives far away I’ve isolated entirely year, worn masks even recommended here. shaming isn’t coming place concern others, it’s apparently coming people itching get back normal want see happen matter cost.  Seems testing vaccines little would prevented this. mean that’s outrageous thing think America. Unless harsh medical issues already, chances dying covid aproach zero.  Wait call nickles? Hello everyone, Grandma going get AstraZeneca vaccine tomorrow afraid, making sure safe time could potentially die vaccine, sure chances low worried switch vaccines yadda yadda yadda, choice one available live wants get vaccinated, ANYTHING minimize risk? I've trying get info manage dig news vaccine unsafe. suggestion, maybe tell it’s free Surely helping use J&amp;J vaccines paused indefinitely. Lol kids, Lol. CDC needs start pivoting toward harm reduction strategies rather risk compensation. definitely sucks unfortunate reality lot countries access enough vaccines mass vaccinate populations, small amount people may die result AstraZeneca vaccine still far better large amounts people die due covid. wish different, could different, capitalism made way  disagreeing, actual risk factor increases if, instance, determine condition impacting - say - women 18-45 birth control. know percentage 7.1 million that, certainly would less.

In case, complicated situation. one hand two vaccines cases CVST, time J&amp;J vaccine useful many scenarios patient making 2nd appointment unreliable (like unhoused population). people wary mRNA want older technology vaccine too. definitive statement originally response someone saying expect get infected eventually argued belief absurd vaccine prevents infection.

My position accurate one. agree ultimately argument propagandize. I'm taking position incorrectly pretending risk infection vaccination feeds anti-vax folks also creates increased risk transition period reach herd immunity.   read thread Craig Spencer, should.

""If loved one among 6 complication FDA/CDC/US govt knew signal didn’t act, I’d furious. really appreciate transparency here.  could’ve easily argued away...” background rate clots” etc. didn’t. mean it’ll harder convince many, especially younger women, get J&amp;J vaccine if/when start using widely again? Yes. ...even risk shown much lower Covid, getting struck lightning, dying vending machine crushing you? Yes. practical importance pause - messaged, focus informing providers - huge. really responsible. ER today. One first patients saw getting briefed J&amp;J decision young woman 30s. got J&amp;J vaccine week ago. symptoms overlap told look for. Today’s announcement changed differential diagnosis &amp; impacted clinical management. That’s exactly meant do. It’s also we’ll get data need. Look, let’s stop pretending people don’t know difference vaccines. potential issues one vaccine mean won’t get others they’re available them. today’s announcement impact vaccine hesitancy? Perhaps. Maybe bit. most. importantly, drastically improve faith public health institutions tasked protecting us. politicized &amp; over-ruled previous admin, critical. that’s exactly think today’s decision right one.""

  deep man.  *full* effect ... I.e., 90% effective contracting covid.

However, think get pretty good protection, specifically severe covid one jab. It’s Canada opted extend second dose 4 months Vaccine skepticism rise die less access vaccine swear campaign south chicago spreading shit fake info people. Got second shot, long sides come do? Lol They're preparing worst. better many vaccines few. They’re decided Tuesday take effect Wednesday.  lot children died flu 2019 died covid 2020. Flu generally transmissible children wel, per CDC. Covid isn’t harmful children. It’s nitpicking - celebrate first doses protective. Even nobody got second doses would much better. hate break you, 10 bodies weigh ton. doesn’t sit well 🥴 called someone crazy saying like two weeks ago ends true  maybe vaccines reduce serve illness (hospitalization) virus makes way community herd immunity achieved. imposing restrictions stop transmission slowing transmission overwhelm healthcare system. sorry friend doom gloom end. know cautious respect mean 6 almost 7 million pretty rare. Hope clear asap. Worried vaccine skepticism  lot less use correctly consistently. 


That 18% per year failure rate ""typical use"" includes women intended use condoms main form birth control necessarily use every time. pandemic controls protect health systems? Nothing death aspect really. catch covid, get severe reaction spend weeks ventilator consuming shit tonne resources.

Did see news articles entire icu wards full patients transferred across countries. 


You get Covid spread easily 7-10 people indoor setting.

Clotting via vaccine would overwhelm health system. driving. Amazing one looks UK results one-dose policy (majority) AZ Pfizer.

Yes, fatal blood-clot reports (19 20m AZ doses end March) UK cases fatalities covid plummeted incredibly.

Even US, less 5 times population, massive rollout Pfizer vaccine still seeing 20-30 times case death numbers daily compared UK.

The vaccine wars good credibility science public imagination - recent study showing Pfizer vaccine produces far less T-cells AZ hold up, credibility lost, especially Pfizer vaccine costing 6 times much per dose requiring much expensive storage handling facilities... Exactly here. First jab completely took 24 hours day like I'd never it. 

Had second jab too... side effects. Good luck yours.  2 shot vaccine man, 75-70 got first dose last month, full effect 3 weeks second dose iirc actual vaccine effect people 90,85.. least 3 months whole 9% vaccinated ""This gonna hurt lot gonna hurt me!"" Public schools hospitals can’t require it’s FDA approved, don’t think time Fall. We’ll see works bills IMO much backlash sustainable teams, venues, etc  Given fact plus takes 2-3 weeks blood clot present itself, plus increased attention side effect, wonder may see something prevalent ""one million"". Hopefully media hype new recorded death. hope fact prevents deaths increasing awareness proper clot treatment. I’m still fence it. Shitty story’s coming out.  Ya, too! fainted getting blood drawn four different occasions. last time could sworn doctor zipping pants waking up. kidding last part fainting real. Thank you. Something like 10 million people obesogenic enodcrine tumor probably never diagnosed... diagnostic rate measly ~3-4% last looked medical literature. working patients try increase (I've even helped several people get diagnosed) NIH big study hope help.

CICO works normal metabolic conditions. last time poked numbers, something like 30-50 million people kind metabolic issue obesogenic. get medical care need.

I experienced hypermetabolic states due medication baseline hypometabolic one. wild able eat huge amounts food feel body rev burn lose pound next day. Less exciting starve can't eat anything yogurt months (due different tumor) even drop size. 

Obesity needs science shaming. able exercise eat way thin. mean I'm mechanic, let anyone else work cars. According CDC, reported deaths lag actual deaths 20 days, average, take much longer cases. deaths could happened many weeks ago.  upvote Don’t let others dictate makes feel safe. end day know tops metal cans goods clean rat poop germs. Don’t stress also doesn’t hurt little sanitary March last year.

Edit: maybe use Lysol wipes something instead hand sanitizer. still need move weight aircraft, partially empty plane less fuel efficient operate? J&amp;J vaccine uses mechanism AZ. I'd expect one issues probably next chopping block come pandemic better system, we'll deserve next pandemic. Page 12 13 showing B1.351 variant growing areas exists time variants pretty much entirely B.1.1.7 (due current prevalence variant), relative E484k variants. % tests coming back positive indicate that. Well better. don’t, it’s panic time. Woah, Russian guy working ship test positive second time? performers seems Western centric bringing attention worldwide. I'm sure US European governments already paid hundreds millions vaccines Westerners would rather get vaccine first.  network BS completely ridiculous. give fuck want cover doctor. get MEDICAL treatment, want covered MEDICAL insurance. Spanish Flu pandemic end without vaccines? 5s  agree

More people die Covid us vaccine even come close dying vaccine

Give public numbers 

Let (especially risk dying Covid) choose want take signing waiver acknowledging risk. 

Am correct 6 cases blood clots 7 million total J&amp;J vaccines? Covid exponentially deadly. 

Let people decide themselves. Save lives. bad side-effects first vaccination means probably already covid without realising - body strong reaction viral proteins already knows about.

Its reason second vaccination tends feel worse, body recognising antigen exposed first vaccine mounting intense immune response. canadian find whole idea ""out network"" outrageous Same. Lost 40lb winter months going daily walks. Australia 50 know what? meet middle this. point here. agree phrasing wrong. exist non-zero risk. 

However, point think risk pretty damn close zero.

First off, MANY health risks higher men women vica versa. affects one imply affect other. fact genetically near identical biological works. hormonal differences men women create different interactions. 

To go even further, saying genetically similar reason believe going similar interactions is... silly. know old people young people genetically nearly identical? yet, despite that, old people young people different health risks. Genetics one part, environmental contextual another massive part medicine.

The fact millions millions injections cases men getting clots implies, least, men less likely get it. odds many women symptoms men nearly unlikely risk. 

So yes, going go ahead take back assertion zero risk. wrong.

However, point time, cases men show symptoms, scientific statement near zero risk. 

If simply missed story men cases, I'll immediately withdraw. question. based currently aware of, known risk men. Nice idea, feels anvilicious. see kind outreach devolving scapegoating condescension. maybe not.   Jeez got lot faith narrative. Willing die it? Seems pretty extreme. Many people. aren’t lol. Stop spreading propaganda man. I’ve already debunked ridiculous claim.  close. 69.420% Oh gosh 😱🙀😱🙀😱 Well, someone who's dealt anxiety, tell odds occurrence factor. There's also severity (perceived) degree control.

It's like someone says, ""why scared flying, car accidents common?"" Yeah, chance surviving plane crash basically nil, driving car, least know best safe.

Same thing blood clots (which actual anxiety mine, unlike flying). fear sits there, undetected, boom, seconds/minutes realize dying over. think part problem IOC committee gave Japan ultimatum. think choice 2021 cancel. could wrong happy corrected. Woooo!  Brazil run moron. Get it. Every shot arm helping. mean challenged proposition risk vaccine side effects outweighs risk covid younger people

and stated expert field. think research writing nonsense.

You even get basics wrong. think people never studied medicine don’t understand sometimes side effects take decades show up. find today, 30 years round develop tumor, cancer, maybe liver failure. Sometimes don’t even effect you, effect unborn child. That’s much red tape. Hell even sometimes red tape fails keep dangerous drug. 

In end whole thing politicized. Shit was/is disgusting watch. someone doesn’t want get vaccine, don’t know it’s safe, nothing wrong that. Injecting something without verifying side effects, lot ask. Kids safer virus. Normally I’m one giving much power individual possible, issues here. don’t full data who’s impacted extent massive surge J&amp;J vaccines last week, clots take 1-2 weeks develop. It’s wise stop vaccinating get data used inform public. people impacted young women, great, give J&amp;J everyone else.

Also, regulatory bodies medicine exist reason. J&amp;J risks losing approval here. government administer vaccine investigate whether lose approval? Yeah person special kind stupid. obviously clinic studies need find exactly keep people becoming dumb. there’s safety risk wearing masks. small real risk without them, mitigate risk wearing them, wouldn’t so? Hey, 1965 1966ers Boomers. Thank you. (We still old probably annoying, Boomers)  Probably got point road. percentage low we're *only* seeing millions doses administered. disagree, that's big number. herd immunity need everything get. People realize free likely easier get vaccinated (tell free) versus antivaxxers hesitant people going new much harder convince article give number 'fully vaccinated' people tested COVID post-vaccination. 5800 whatever number is, 5800 77 million.

It would helpful numbers compare positive percentages vaccinated people unvaccinated people. Hopefully vaccinated people far less lately test positive.

Over last 3 months, really seems like testing deemphasized people first 10 months Covid. people charge things really done good job messaging lately. one vaccine stopped possibly causing blood clots less frequently birth control. CDC director changes mind every day. vaccinated face 'experts' talking vaccines talking vaccinated.

It might become apparent next 3 months things bungled here. Yea that’s said social business government. copays 25 less. seeing unaffordable copays? Saying viral vectors way gone tomorrow totally different. think typical vaccine development way could mean 10+ years. free makes belly button generate wifi government uses spy you. “If it’s free, you’re product.”  many people? idea many people go mrna vaccines within 2-4 weeks takes assess situation? many people going lose access period vaccine two weeks?

the jnj vaccine whopping 3% vaccinations far.... pfizer said increase capacity deliver 10% vaccines end may...

who exactly getting shots want it? future thanks science! got J&amp;J two weeks ago (I’m excited start stuff again). concerned clotting first weeks? chance could risk rest life something like that? maybe women care people males do. literally socialist communism! free insurance? type insurance info get signed one. number assuming everyone got infected. numbers good major projection! Oh. [Sign ""Bro forgot walk, damn guess it'll take 2 hours remember"" called get added hospital waitlist, even real appointment, insisted insurance info literally ran phone make sure Honestly shouldn’t given info desperate vaccine. 

Why wonder many people wouldn’t even waitlist didn’t insurance info. 

None. federal government pays insurance. still get money overdose leading cause calls Poison Control Centers accounts 56,000 emergency room visits, 2,600 hospitalizations, estimated 458 deaths due acute liver failure quick large number studies support finding NSAIDs cause increased risk serious cardiovascular thrombotic events, varying estimates much risk increased. Estimates increased relative risk range 10 percent 50 percent more, depending drugs doses lot ""safe"" drugs chance serious event kind. generally think it. admit I'm qualified compare one certain drugs dangerous depending people's medical history multiple options treatment vaccination better everyone. Poe’s law little scary I’ll tell ya that.  natural evolution seems moving towards B.1.351. We’ve seen mutations could allow even B.1.351 evade vaccines further, clearly haven’t selected yet. know, B.1.351 could perfect balance immune evasion infectivity, that’s far go without losing great deal infectivity great deal immune evasion. We’ll see suppose, I’d willing bet virus played best cards already. federal government providing vaccine free charge people living United States, regardless immigration health insurance status.

[Direct info found pays COVID-19 vaccine tab. need put big signs says VACCINE FREE sister received $50 bill Kroger administering vaccine. What’s that? may also worse comparison, second dose appear much viral vector vaccines (because viral vector immunity).

Granted, could take single vaccine, probably better AZ J&amp;J. Post history 🙄 MUST paid. link FAQ straight DOL 6,999,999 go. Fair enough. I'm likely continue much old behavior, within limits law know. think gave insurance card went in. Occam’s razor says lie probable 2x 1:19,000 USA, administration fee paid insurance federal government. one charged getting covid vaccine, period I've doctor forever. insurance now, even regular checkups cost enough plan skipped them. like car insurance, crash burn debt till die. 


Getting vaccine one weirdest feelings life. knot stomach after, time sort wondering supposed get credit card. 


Fucking hate medical care here. knew issue AZ could show since similar technology would appreciated knowing risk ahead time.

That's super understandable. 

Remember one hypothesis (which now, unfortunately, consider less likely true) problems AZ vaccine related non-prefusion-stabilized spike protein AZ vaccine, whereas spike protein produced JnJ mRNA vaccines prefusion stabilized. 

Meanwhile, JnJ AZ vaccines based different Adenoviruses. (The AZ vaccine based modified chimpanzee adenovirus; JnJ uses human adenovirus. Sputnik vaccine uses pair human adenoviruses ... believe Russia, cause clotting issues - although I'm sure believe Russia. Cansino also adenovirus-vectored vaccine, they're claiming clotting issues, although, again, much trust them?

So aware JnJ incidents, idea adenovirus vector might culprit certainly one possibilities (and surprised discovered clots looking, AZ virus) one. say ""similar"" technology true far goes, actually somewhere around dozen AD26 (the jnj vax) viral vector vaccines world (albeit they're almost still trial stages): Ebola, Zika, Malaria, RSV, filovirus, others, without, far know, reports clotting issues (with big caveat numbers low confidence they'd show up). 

So time gave shot, best could said ""The blood clots AZ might caused viral vector similar identical viral vector we're using here, also might be."" Like said, order plenty takeout restaurants would normally dine still getting money. Another thing, even wasn’t getting takeout, restaurants struggling doesn’t oblige spend money whatever reason don’t want to.  oh see :/ going get mine last week, legit day appointment, got fever since head minor sinus issue whole week got paranoid got tested tested positive covid. hate see USA's craziness spread Canada. think it’s like move avoid eroding trust public health institutions.

My two teenage boys spent last week half sick Covid. took care them. gotten symptoms, tested negative three times 8 days (I test test). 

These vaccines AMAZING!  Thinking engineer, defective lot production line? effect, ""have vaccines."" We're still supply-constrained middle pandemic.

If give many vaccines soon can, means people get sick die. vaccines could give tomorrow; pausing four weeks mean people get sick die. nice we're still vaccinating lot people vaccines, we're vaccinating many need to. Yeah great, denying that. Since 12 times cases every day US, fully vaxxed population small subsample. Right call, Poland lockdowns prevent shit. damaged economy badly still save lives. work vaccines giving US? Pfizer one?

In India able afford transportation giving preventative vaccine named ""Covishield"" work much. People still getting covid vaccination! awesome. doubt similar efficacy rates single dose. vaccines do. 

The difference two doses, case mRNA vaccines (and Sputnik, uses two different vectors) almost certainly pull ahead terms preventing infection. Mexican here, getting supplies almost every known vaccine. rush. Sounds exactly like current experience. I’m 12 hours arm less sore last time I’m headache (I mild one hours first time). many Americans hot infected within time period? allow estimate effectiveness Chances neither accurate, either. squids? OK Vegans themselves. Wrecks hormones ultimately fertility, probably birth control pill horrendous health.

The trifecta:

Veganism, Vaccinated, Contraceptives. younger liberal generation doomed. actually quantify many people vaccinated due pause? meaning people forego vaccinations altogether simply move forward either mrna vaccines?

no? possibly know costing actual lives? Right, even going back denominator being:

* March 1, 5,800 / 25,446,405 = 0.0227%

Still muchhh lower general population, I'm sure 5,800 lower 6 weeks ago well Um data risk hospitalization death covid children low objectively true, meaning additional risk-lowering gained making kids wear masks fall marginal. Data “both sides” thing pretending that’s true Science, it’s political posturing, sort Correct Acceptable reddit Wow - that’s super intense! don’t think I’ve ever fever 103 before. I’m 12 hours imagine things haven’t come pass yet, I’m likely clear. person got first dose got second, contacted doctors, saying syringe might defective. Would sort third bad? get much vaccine? BCBS TX pharmacy billed $16 first Moderna shot. surprised cheap was.

FYI paid zero. definitely great, 12 times cases every day. Hence definitely highly effective. However, would devide 5,800 number vaccinated people. One, think count two weeks second dose, two number increased time. Tell what, I'm going make random-internet-stranger-promise right now, going fine! know different restaurants trying keep enough customers stay business. It’s sad see.
In Colorado anyway, restaurant workers eligible vaccine since 2 weeks Easter. Many kids also want hit social academic development milestones. want hang friends. want play sports, theater, school band, etc. Maybe older ones even want go party kiss crush. activities aren’t arbitrary. Peer-peer socialization crucial eventually becoming functioning adult.

We can’t ask kids give another year childhoods slight unproven long-term risk. families want opt kid regular life, that’s fine. might even necessary small number kids serious health issues. give families choice. Lots countries would want wear mask mandate gone? Nothing stopping unless store makes no-mask policy *highly* doubt happen does, probably store want anyway.

Plus also wear makeup too, even without mask. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Firstly - shame, embarrassment. tried tough guy far long, hyperactive vasovagal something control. totally front Dr/nurse history fainting due vasovagal issues. appreciate told, help faint site, much paperwork them!

For - make sure lying done. hurt time all. However, vasovagal reaction know get faint. ask slowly lift bed flat sitting period time. reactions severe, take 30-45 minutes. everything really slowly. sitting edge bed, stay minutes too. walk round inside leave building. 

For long time used feel really guilty taking much medical professionals time something 99% population standard done within minute. 

I actually got injection without fainting (the staff brilliant), fainted next morning getting bed. got bed quite quickly (needed toilet!) thought, 'don't feel good', thought injection, gone. even next morning, take time.

That's world works. Much likely vaccine shipped states would like it. AZ that's NEED too, asks insurance think might get people worried they're going get billed.

A sore arm? brother, explain punching arm goes gets it.

Hell, get free donuts shit go get one. Upstate NY, even specifically 3 weeks day - currently recommended 21 days 16-42 considered acceptable (iirc - range something like that). time day fine. UK domestic AZ production 2m week, would 1 year vaccinate every adult ignoring vaccines. vaccine shortage hurting us right plus three variants running wild extra kick teeth. Would much rather charged $100

Sounds pretty selfish me. reasons vaccinating people $100.00 make important. public health care NEVER work USA

In Canada, people talked HAPPY wait turn vulnerable front line workers, teachers etc. get vaccinated.

On bright side, people vaccinated people infect you. Massively Yeah, first dose, first dose plus two weeks number matters. 0% 80% matters 80% 95%. told rare time government truly made something free

Aren't vaccines free US? want it, around me. one 'advocating' anything. reporting preliminary trial results.

It matter anyway hardly like go pick vaccine stick arm. least UK. AZ vaccine first dose, given AZ vaccine second. Nope. meaningful milestone first shots, maybe two weeks past first shot.

The jump 0% protected 80-90% matters way jump 80-90% 95%.

That's metric matters, instead mostly see two dose numbers, one dose headline number.

I'm going fully change behaviour till two weeks second shot, area low caserates I'd happily hang inside friend's house, eat indoors restaurant. Govrnment wants last ever lockdown. they're crushing covid also going 70% herd immunity. means we're fully open June, we'll back normal. Whereas countries like US EU still fretting cases rising hospitalisations. think virus mutate hard year's time even T-cells recognize it? antibodies (which go away relatively quickly)

honest question, im trying learn role T-cells covid study finds certainly legitimate ""people reddit baselessly speculate"". rushed. wanted rush would way predicted winter peak. 😂 that's fucking great Thatsthepoint.jpg You’re implying that’s Fauci already saying /r/Fragilewhiteredditor ""our"" public health officials. China. I'm still okay got moderna lol Aaaahhhhh yes, patience super overused phrase ""we critical phase/wave/time"" employer overnight shots on-site, they’re giving $100 every employee fully vaccinates. european federalism without patriotism? second dose 3 weeks later **to hour**, anytime day? Fairly soon unvaccinated population vaccinated one look fairly similar, eligibility opens way up.

If anything, vaccinated population skew old, therefore likely die things. I'm pretty sure extra go mexico canada first. That’s potentially 100,000 unneeded deaths. canadian government decided make foreign workers exempt travel quarantine

Do source that? Cause seems like one things that's, know, true...

Another explanation spreading easily transmissible, like UK variant, actually spreading even more. also they're sequencing. According Søren Brostrøm, responsible Danish Research Institute (SSI), removed national vaccine program. still get doctor thinks tolerate vaccine. think still keep many them. Also, large portion soon old use. Damn 4 hours?
Your nation insane.
My girlfriend two days fever vaccine get paid leave three days (counting day get vaccine).

(still, vaccine plan sucks) really exciting much potential technology diseases, good giant pile funding that.

Looks like we're getting AIDS vaccine this. Maybe treatments chronic fatigue syndrome. Even potential cancer believe. Sounds like pretty damn well.

My strong guess vaccine magical prevent covid virus entering system, lets kill gets even toehold. means never enough virus shedding transmit.

So useful sense words, prevents infection transmission. Hey, come on, urging patience. Don’t say anything Argentina third world country

Argentina is. Propranolol non narcotic. I'm recovery get drug tested regularly show test. Yup. need perfect, need R &lt; 1.

That's it. we've got much better that. hear, hear got shot pharmacy , teams back end verifying uninsured submissions possible record corrected. 

Also ask us cost ? Lol . Gratz vaxx cure covid disease? No.

The cure covid pandemic? Abso-fucking-lutely. mRNA vaccines effective beyond wildest dreams, much better hoping for.

Smallpox vaccines left scar, polio vaccines paralyzed grandmother, still cause outbreaks today. they're still good enough (nearly) eradicate disease.

We got incredibly lucky, people insist insanely pessimistic it. incorrect unhelpful, since discourages people getting vaccinated. Mostly AZ wasnt delivering dose schedule EU still deliver country. now? happen know 7 day average?

I mean flu deaths rate America, currently deaths per day nation would see bad flu season. open now, considering would open amount people dying flu everyday? Lots banks consulting companies started travelling already albeit limited numbers. ramp massively May. Religious people world special kind stupid. tell get vaccines get 1000 likes whatever shitty social network assumedly that's ""fully vaccinated"" means.

does sister thousands friends? apparent since lied faces masks working entire thing would bungled.

Getting wrong every single time kind impressive, better odds flipping coin. Yes but, walk instead drive. isolating instead isolating.

YOU get vaccinated need it. young 20 year old risk contacts doesnt need it, risk COMPARABLE. risk average 20's year old covid death lower AZ vaccine. results skewed dont factor age deaths, quarantine habits, contacts, UK, death 28 days positive result counted covid death... asinine. pay taxes get vaccine, ""really free"" taxes pay pay taxes. thanks I’m guessing immune systems aren’t working full capacity.

this likely, unless engaging high risk behaviours Covid cause fatalities children. [In Brazil 1,300 babies died new variants spread children easily compared original type prevalent last year. many spread to? comparing cases. look deaths muchhhh larger difference Heard too! counter Pope saying OK. Maybe discuss things doctor instead reacting misinformation Reddit. 5,158,422 since 2/1

So 5,800 infections since (some likely before) 0.11% infections vaccinated people they’re loose schedule company holiday We’re early stages seems promising. pill based cure lung cell fusion caused virus would alleviate chronic long term lung damage see patients today. We’re relying robotic technology assume drug would work, I’d love see actual clinical trials patients. trying jerk here. point would need living rock apply you? news everywhere. can’t look form media without ad blasting covid vaccine info. 

Are people solitary? FDA approved. JnJ pulled vaccine people dying it. It’s super significant. Probably observation discovered fact see shocking, controversial, unexpected

Probably way shocking unexpected. Controversial pretty easy see.  Preprint articles require higher degree scrutiny rigor accurately evaluate many types articles. kind discussion would appropriate strictly scientific subreddit /r/COVID19.

that absolutely true.... new york... jnj vaccine appointments cancelled still open modern/pfizer appointments speak.... way anything close 10 million people getting kind vaccine within next two weeks....

But mean c'mon, even 5,800 20 million (which not) still significantly lower case rate general non-vaccinated population.

There 77,000 **daily** cases US, certainly 5,800 cases total vaccinated people nothing short miracle.

I get point searching ""number 'fully vaccinated' people tested COVID post-vaccination"" obviously good that's sub works, hivemind decided anything short saying vaccines solved problems verboten. Initially COVID testing ""no upfront cost"", ""no cost site"", ""no cost you"" means definitely get bill mail weeks later especially insurance.

THIS COMMENT OP. Wow, getting badly downvoted. Whole lot people like told bad news. Happy help, report insurance that, I'm sure government something say behaviour. per capita healthcare spend per year Germany half Germany one expensive ones. part? average IQ 100. part bit facetious. meant highlight fact people dumb survive without infrastructure technology built small segment present historical population. think actually bad follow precautions. closed weekend due lockdown (except tourists) rare opportunity see busy city like Istanbul totally emptied out. can't eat indoors anyway, that's spread is. People definitely getting infected due gathering indoors, likely (another reason lockdowns force people inside make much sense anymore whatever). 

You also easily get tested airport. I'm suggesting met boyfriend Istanbul (we also long distance many options time). got tested negative...we also paranoid pretty much behaved would home anyway...mainly going walks outside staying inside... daughter preschool daily. I'm way worried Covid-19 vaccine that's already heavily vetted (and would shut trial first signs danger).

Weighing risks, see participating lower risk, higher. say relaxed measures + variant? Looks like vaccine job then. knows serious would without it. *Because stupid definitely free people without insurance. got mine Walgreens free don’t insurance. [You verify certain school districts coming back in-person learning, that’s necessarily even five days week

Many districts school closures beginning year well

I also don’t think “eh might well” good argument keeping covid restrictions know benefit marginal, especially fall

My point far much focus covid restrictions children provide little benefit, clear significant harm done school closures imagine probably many meetings covid even arent actually anything covid. Also increased stress fear patient may infected tested yet. probably sucks...

&amp;#x200B;

My local hospital solved problem admitting anyone fever, matter symptoms. Absolutely insane lmao.  Immediate care healthcare professional 100% justified. worries feel free DM cost bad. Happy help can.  course. It’s vaccine cure. Covid going eradicated enough people vaccinated follow guidelines stop spread. yup, real issue (and really along). main point restrictions is/was keep hospitals getting overwhelmed. good news older people preexisting conditions vaccinated, theoretically shouldn’t see high hospitalization rates even cases go think combination vaccines and, unfortunately, large number people got infected past year developed immunity. 

Also, work hospital, older, vulnerable people likely require hospitalization catch COVID largely vaccinated. younger people catching COVID would likely require hospitalization.

It looks like COVID largely run course California, course barring major mutation renders vaccines ineffective. We've already gradually opening past month without much increase cases.

Best luck situation Canada. looks like there's big shortage vaccines guys? guys seem much better following social distancing rules us though. 6ft even meaningful inside large congregate settings like this? I'd curious see study one way another. Probably not. high risk groups get vaccinated like they’re supposed vaccine it’s thing. pandemic ending. end pandemic nobodies going intestinal worms anymore!!! Let's assume 5,800 cases since 2/1 hypothetical:

5,158,422 cases since 2/1

US Population 18 is: 209,128,094

25,446,405 fully vaccinated March 1st (got least 1 dose ~2/1)

* 5,800 / 25,446,405 vaccinated people= 0.0228%

183,681,689 unvaccinated march 1

* 5,158,422 cases / 183,681,689 vaccinated people = 2.81%

So 90% lower chance getting covid vaccine. well documented reported Pfizer &amp; Moderna well. Yes numbers %'s may fluctuate, however look extremely efficacious Hospitalized? You’re likely get hit car. It’s extremely rare. feel get checked out. aren’t long-term risk. It’s observed 3 weeks out.  Well article looks like it’s Florida going mask rules fall Thank much kindness concern. finally mend scary week. lucky insurance hopefully insane knows. payment plans. bad takes weeks vaccines actually protect people. going get worse Michigan gets better. us going use information right ways Uh, teachers here? Where's evidence class? Yeah discussion seems dangerous right spread. Personally, I’ve never issue insurance beyond dispute hundred dollars.

But you’re missing point. whole point article 7 million Americans believe vaccine isn’t free. 7 million people brightest among us? Maybe not.

And yes, I’d classify months unnecessary stress—especially you’re recovering illness—as getting burnt. Continuing spread various strains still concern. 

Especially one eventually mutate vaccines effective. Yes, today give perspective \~0.02% Americans tested +ve. Today. 3% people who're currently getting vaccinated day. So, little 180,000 people getting shots day pause. they're getting mRNA instead, means someone else getting mRNA shot. There're free shots; every one would going someone.

^((That's 3% 3 million, multiplied 2 account J&amp;J one dose.) ^) OB actually scheduled TDAP booster 13 days final Moderna shot, womp. Yes, -15 - 26 doable. bad gets -50 celsius wind live.

I go Minnesota often, difference pretty significant.  many Americans cross border Mexico / Canada buy insulin. Whats point? free. funded taxes, nothing charged point care (edit: medically necessary procedures / medication) Also, ask canadian, (or Brit, Ozzie, German etc) give system(s), adopt US one, see many receptive idea. arent dumb. healthcare number one policy issue Americans, dont think anyone else keen adopt corporate shitshow system. really hard believe me. Surely get demand-constrained state, increase informational ads get people take it. Since places supply-constrained, don’t need convince people take moment. Got Moderna finally dinner INSIDE restaurant year. Woo hoo. article read like episode House. Bring Guatemala, we're lacking donated-only vaccines Mask compliance decreased significantly late. used feel relatively safe going grocery store. packed people everyone following social distancing mask orders. 

This past weekend however went store, completely packed half people wearing masks hardly social distancing. ended walking right back out. I'll curbside pickup fully vaccinated grocery stores officially longer safe. People simply longer care developed ""if die, die"" mentality absolute, complete, total disregard peoples safety.  opposite actually. Healthier people better immune systems severe side effects, average. Moderna second dose: arm became pretty sore weirdly numb drive home (soreness lasted like 2 days), slept hours extra night. That's it. props Pfizer vaccines require complex refrigeration likely sent neighborhoods. Unless someone develops better mobile reefer truck. 

Part advantage Johnson Johnson vaccine could single dose needed lower tech refrigeration. Lol people thought CDC officials would actually willing make difficult decision. They’ll delay thousands die Covid, won’t blamed that. Thank you! follow them! shot haven’t taken kind medicine 14 years. even Tylenol. glad news came shot wouldn’t gotten it.  point, 5 weeks later, body theoretically already passed point  Probably meant people pop motrin daily pain. doubt taking 400mg Advil one time relieve bad headache going much. Well additional part is, hospitalizations deaths vaccinated group. Real world saying 95% reduction risk death. think assume another 100,000 deaths US, we're going see maybe 5,000 deaths fully vaccinated people. shame. Doubtful vaccines approved kids Pfizer one close approval even 12 older.  friend mine rejected AZ shot got second appointment 2 weeks later

I understand wanting groups abnormally high risk dangerous blood clots 100% capacity, considering possible 6 foot social distancing. bit anti-vaxish alright Unfortunately vaccines expire,I’m sure quickly, it’s difficult ship halfway around globe Machismo mean insurance cover vaccines now, made sense free. Try worry, excited! There's amazing real world data showing much difference made preventing hospital admissions deaths older folk. She'll grand. “True normalcy” age deadly pandemic = constant sickness death

It’s early make decision. many Americans refuse get vaccine ignorant reasons. IDEA whether anything even close immunity August September. mention, variants spreading, indicates virus quickly mutating, idea whether people fully vaxxed safe whatever 12th 15th variant vaccine might appear school starts. Hilarious.  Nobody serious set memorial day end date. Maybe people overly optimistic. Damn lol. Good thing there’s vaccine. read trials though, correct? rate general population associate causality. clots blood issues observed trial AZ?

Of course vaccine able perfectly safe across vast majority world. vaccines proven safer, no?

Take whatever vaccine available, opportunity privilege wait week get one comfortable with. understand lot people privilege, esp Europe roll vaccines pretty lackluster say least. talking masking/testing/social distancing even FALL semester? even 8-9 months vaccinating time school year starts, wont even enough go back normal? SMH type messaging complete disaster. Nobody 100% sure yet normal going look like anyway. take europe august least vaccinate 70% adults. Thanks bud backfire they're upfront everything. 

Not mentioning masks socially distancing required classes, concerts, planes, stadiums 100% even proof vaccine checked make people skeptical future.  understand feelings. I’m trying remember birth control years didn’t blink risk much larger. also follow two incredible infectious diseases scientists Instagram informative helpful whole pandemic. 

[Jessica Bristow recommend giving follow Nice! I'm getting second Friday. Can't wait finally able go back friends again.  Forget traffic comment moment. 


Let's say socially distance, quarantine, everything right, get ran someone rushing work paying attention, also anti-vax carrier. sudden catch unvaccinated die. 


Is chance scenario happening 39 10 million? would accept argument rare point similar, indistinguishable. 


But let's think limitless ways plan could backfire, unsanitary grocery store, family getting memo, people social distancing public (its control). Etc etc. Would still argue chance clot worth potential risk catching covid?


People asking potentially risk life take vaccine, already happens countless times every day life. 


At pedestrian crossing, trust someone phone run over. 


In supermarket trust light fitting installed correctly fall walking around. 


You trust person walking street complete control dog attack you


The list could go point is, risk life 39 10m every day, multiple times, blunt honest, could turn biggest regrettable mistake life getting vaccine, even think everything right. 


Please re-evaluate. Why...? get vaccinated. ""I'm conservative- say exactly bullshit narrative literally every conservative rag spews daily"". Right, that's that's going work dosent provide like they've made company poll for, waiting word now, would quite bit safe convenient.

That said, many patients, Walgreens chains insurance search pull patient's insurance. 100%, works frequently. Canadian here, confirm targeted hotspots Ontario. sure rest Canada. So...men dumb... Yeah, multiplied 100 instead one million, makes better. First J&amp;J shit show lol.

Hopefully every kid Florida able vaccinated school year starts. Texas Florida also part Sunbelt big wave summer last year. indoor gatherings begin increase couple months, they'll precarious position managed vaccinate enough population then.

I'm wondering county part ""vaccine wall"" people talking about.  first shot CVS, even though stated insurance scheduled appointment online, still asked proof insurance three times checking in, despite day stopped ask told insurance it'd covered federal program. honestly I'm expecting sort bill show mail point near future. Gotta love overblown politics something. almost everything take counter higher bloody risk. literally afraid look it. longer insurance money running quick. even want think medical expenses eating last bit money have.

I'd say 2 months Moderna great two, thing negative heard friends. told second dose fucking joke. better take couple days off.  thank profit system that. cdc recommending lockdown GASLIGHTING???

You've immedietly lost sort argument wanted make considering know use word gaslighting

Pointing words twisted form agenda bits pieces taken apart put back together GASLIGHTING.  CDC said vaccines won’t eventually stop spread? highly depends age group, though, also generally true numbers state, read.

[This 'low exposure' scenario infographic circulated estimated prevent 70x many COVID ICU admissions get serious side effects AZ 60-69 age category, drops 0.7 ICU admissions prevented per case serious side effects, 20-29 age group. certainly seem subsets people giving AZ vaccine appears likely cause harm, prevent harm. That's UK cautious giving vaccine younger age group. mean indoor dining never closed lived I’m definitely eating we’re vaccinated.

Next question? There's ""you get pay for"" mindset work. ""If great can't charge it?"" probably already covid without realising it

Can back ad hoc hypothesis up? need shut literally every person bad experience vaccine. Sometimes hurt that's fine. crazy. Canada public private (or employer) insurance. Public covers hospitals (less nightly fee like $100), doctors, etc. Private covers prescriptions, hearing aids, glasses etc..

I don’t understand people determined separate two. UK 66 million today 2,491 cases.

See it’s weird totally buy figures. trouble squaring away resistant Republican demographics tend skew older 65+ Age demo going cross 80% vaxxed soon. thinking people saying “No” pollsters quietly getting vaxxed anyway. guess one hope. right choice broad sense, god optics sending vaccine think safe enough us less wealthy countries really, really bad.

Birth control used treatment sorts menstrual issues. pretty frustrating society decided treatment legitimately pretty dangerous fine women seek treatments issues debilitating. common misconception. CDC lumped guidance Pfizer Moderna together. clinical trial, effectiveness Pfizer tested 7-days Moderna tested 14 days. countries unclumped misconception. it’s 7 days second dose Pfizer still 14 days Moderna. different brand, different product. think people overreacting blood clots matter snobbery, seems implying.

I live southern U.S. we're see supply exceed demand. think excess demand particular vaccine really nightmare scenario here. Well, live UK tell much lockdown reality. schools opened early March there's uptick cases month later.

Israel got really low case numbers since mid-march, significantly better UK (relative nearly 7 times population), required really huge 2-dose vaccination rollout compared UK prioritising 1-dose.

Also, recent publication suggesting Pfizer vaccine generates one third T-cells compared AZ proved correct would worryingly suggest protection Pfizer decay much faster AZ revaccination necessary often.

Considering Pfizer almost 6 time expensive AZ requires expensive storage handling facilities, would good. First mini horses, this. get vaccine I'm going back normal. end point. whole point limit hospitalisations deaths. Getting vaccine that. Agreed

Let people see current assess risks.

Downvote away. you’re sitting ground gate you’re cooking death AC isn’t running. nothing video LMAOO


You watched it? Like u/ridgegirl29 15 second twitter interview! 1% Corona straints Germany SA variant, 90% british variant. fact makes bit concerning. “Vaccines safe effective”. Facebook Instagram fact checkers sued shots go dinner bars whenever fuck want. Join club. Enjoy life fact position so. Perhaps read article first. Evidence mutations already established. matter time virus mutate COVID-21. got first shot 2 weeks ago. signed idea free. found looking prices(I insurance) I'd imagine entire purpose pause decide risk group is. Yea get man, thanks, didn’t read comment bitchy way don’t worry, also didn’t mean comment bitchy way lol problem level risk put context. American Academy Pediatrics reports “0.00%-0.03% child COVID-19 cases resulted death” (source NEVER reach point 100% certain kid die covid. even now, majority population US vaccinated, chance death child contracted covid-19 literally near zero. additional benefit making kids wear masks would also near zero risk low begin with.

I mean, straight believe mortality statistics covid children? Like, think American Academy Pediatrics making up? Sorry facts don’t fit fantasy.

I still heard one good reason forcing kids wear masks school fall better providers well paperwork stand point, fighting get paid sucks. Early pandemic, remember epidemiologists characterizing covid ""not used"" humans, strong good, would eventually become something less dangerous mutated. never saw anything official that, experts suggesting would get less harmful time. seemed correlate coronavirus's maturity less destructive. Men work longer hours. Anti British sentiment. stunk start. 80 percent 2 weeks. Canada 55+ too. frustrating. I'm 37 i'll take anything fucking gimme something want leave house. authorized ages, provinces giving 55+ national advisory 55+ only. Yes, free everyone law. system doesn’t allow it, give fake address something. Ugh Chile. around 2k cases daily (national population 18m) December ish. everything opened summer months (December - March) vaccination began February things seemed going well suddenly 9k cases daily vaccine proven 50% effective preventing infection. daily cases day year ago. Well that’s beauty nuanced take would still issue pause risk people. call people ""idiots"".

It's advertised free I’ve never related comment more. Today watched SAG awards days back like, “really, they’re zoom thing again?” Grammys outside nothing else? Give us sense hope/normalcy. Today, Stanford health Vaccination clinic mess. Crowded lines inside building starting fourth floor working stairs. temp checks sanitizers. 
2 hours get appointment vaccine part process took minutes. rest time validating paperwork taking insurance info. 
They made come across as, cost vaccine 80 dollar administration fee charged insurance.  


Horrible bedside manner, way long spent holding people tight space insurance could collected billed too, info collected well advance. I'm sure people would scared away poor communication.  
It freaked family insurance could pay cost known expected to.  
The posting website describes slightly better elaborating insurance government billed. announced anywhere vibrantly registration appointment process wow money focus today. 


It way weird especially contrast experience going Sutters' drive clinic respected human start finish. Everyone comfortable going get vaccine im certain many scared treatment like that. Yeah get it, get weeds. trying contradictory pointing guess. someone lived sides boarder, I'll take Canadian system. mother wait operations Missouri well. Canada issues many related Rural medicine issue everywhere. trust BCBS much trust Charter/Spectrum. work healthcare. understand state covering administration costs uninsured insurance supposed cover customers. got first dose January. That’s brand new $8k deductible! 

I marked uninsured afraid would kind exclusion billing error. kept thinking might “accidentally” billed absurd amount since haven’t met deductible. don’t time spend hours dealing phone calls, appeals, ultimately wrongly sent collections. 

Sorry sending bill California. don’t like regulating insurance industry instead allowing companies traumatize us all. Thanks!

I discovered gov site could get waiting lists — ones using pharmacy appointments. Fingers crossed!

But weather nice, road trip also sounds great :) far data showing lethal much infectious overwhelming health care system sheer number cases. gave advice doctor would given him. 

And could easily died COVID stroke COVID. 

On top that, ***a lot*** people getting vaccinated right now. odds number overlapping number people going stroke week anyway, regardless vaccination status, extremely high. 

Don't stress man. absolutely made right call. Arguably another issue healthcare consistently expansive US even it’s free, people would never naturally come conclusion own. America #1! Listen dude, temporary pause figure path forward vaccine otherwise healthy young woman died it. stats numbers, people... fucking respect.  Literally scam. 

You risk life military order get healthcare. world scam?! mean? That's physically impossible. social distancing enforced 100% capacity. now. soon. Like June I'd bet.  Anecdotally, experience, women likely anti-vaxxers men. otherwise healthy 25 year old man experienced well following J&amp;J vaccine, looks like it’s women (although they’re majority). get vaccinated. heard reduces shit risk

No vaccine... boarding card. Yes, it’s scam. federal government provides [better private sector. It’s better model reforming national healthcare public insurance.

Oh they’re also vaccinating spouses caregivers, recent change law Nothing free Almost 50% 18+ population received least one dose, 37.3% total population has, according CDC website.  20 many? Nobody ever said vaccine 100% effective. studies shown vaccines offer protection SA variant. also acknowledged one dose Pfizer Moderna also option. Sure ideal 2, many countries either one shot delaying second shot 12 weeks like UK 4 months like Canada. you’re really small percent population can’t get 2 shots can’t get J&amp;J really suggested 1-dose alternative groups. concrete numbers yet regards much protection get one dose Pfizer vaccine? That's small amount Americans. right incentive get vaccinated though unfortunately, least USA, refuse often care much environment. got Moderna Etihad Wed morning too. Took opportunity get McDonald's breakfast mooch round big Asda, obvs. Good point. Hold beer watch this? Ignorance. socializing not, learn effectively technologies kids going use future. 2021, 1930. Can't expect schools look same. significant factors contributing blood clots women, like taking birth control, calcium supplements medications. Covid first thing spread person person aircraft. definitely seems like it’s first thing people feel shut air travel for. Don’t want covid? cold? flu? Don’t fly. sure else tell you, rest us flying around blast without you. sex? think understood saying all.

Hard explain since New Yorker rest assured establishment New York using excelsior pass, present CDC vaccine card well. know experience. Dont vet go VA? non American vaccines free US? Like lived states wanted child get Polio Vaccine would pay that? Massive eye roll Right, county health department bills insurance COVID test insured, use state grant cover cost insured. way means provide tests, individual getting tested never expected pay pocket it. Yeah honestly understand tough kids close schools. goal keep schools open think need accept fact cases inevitably go point there’s much it. I’m big fan 9:30pm curfew could live it. However, 8pm mid april much me. cousin, tried get take vaccine, started spouting You-Know-Who's talking points. man party already responsible many deaths responsible more. went birthday February awesome like mild crowds. blast. 100 years old granduncle got AZ vaccine side effects. I’m South America don’t really know guys there. read comment said effectively lockdown, schools open then? What’s rationale parents working home assume? ""Virus may become something"" fuck article find every part US healthcare system scam. Dont get wrong canadian system isnt perfect need fund better. I've never waited anything never spent dime parking.

The VA scam income low enough, actually pay transportation costs too. blame them. That's nothing Healthcare usually free priced country. Shocker. history doesn’t repeat itself. Right. don’t get everyone butthurt wearing masks, goal 0 children die definitely mask flu, ban bike riding, ban school sports, ban pools etc. prevent conservatives carrying voter suppression. top 4th inning. Covid restricting going away another year least people say Bolsonaro half (or even less) answer, Brazil really big country, rich one like USA, tens millions Brazilians live day day NEED go outside work else they'll literally starve death, one reasons Mexico never went lockdown well.

Going lockdown poor country ain't easy, look cases India, they've increased 1200% 2 months, yet can't go lockdown, possible. complete waste resources. Kids home school scared around children. Really well said 👏 think priority men called sexism. Similarly find J&amp;J indeed unsafe women would part sexism women.

For clarification MGTOW, gay. side effects AZ vaccine severely downplayed country (a family friend told doctor there's slim chance high body temperature nothing else) opinion they're still downplayed.
When alternative vaccines loss life acceptable (imo). government bought mostly AZ due much lower price vaccinated (it optional certainly pressures get it) government workers it.
It's different country country AZ still ""good enough"" general public, certain sectors (teachers, etc.) pressured vaccinate. Highly likely vaccine cheaper Moderna availability second, less important, factor.
At end day anyone decide get not, let's downplay negative effects laser focusing ""the greater good"" angle. Already much country. May 31st. Plenty time full immunity kick everyone wants it. One corporate labs gall actually send bill ""lab services"" preemployment drug screen. Ya, bill went went straight shredder. worried that, yes, vaccine free. $30 alcohol swab, $500 syringe, $40 band aid afterward. lack quality public messaging quality PR attacking/testing covid taking vaccine started terribly Trump hasn’t honestly gotten whole shit ton better Biden. It’s frustrating. think lot factors work, including unfortunate American obsession everything controlled administered state local level, preventing one-stop, universally true FAQ go, eligible, cost, etc. Ideally would simple federal website, QR code’s everywhere, simple three digit (ala 911) hotline people could call, etc. well clever incentives get vaxxed. saw anti-vax propaganda bittorrent search site, places. made angry especially expecting crap show places. Thankfully none residents actually sick. cares? people definitely like keep persona aligns political beliefs. constantly overhear coworker talking conspiracy theories stolen elections people similar beliefs, yet told looking vaccine appointment days ago. thought would want bleach light injection instead. 🤷‍♂️ Wow government needs blame mountains shot free!!! Yeah. highest case load per capita EU currently. ok people dying they're overreacting 6 cases side effect? think guys getting issue.. People avoid dying getting covid, even getting covid, without vaccine

You acting like people gonna make noble sacrifice line chance die.. lol

People want die, regardless else deaths may save. everything gets completely opened, masks anything, assuming kids won’t see enormous jump infections? ease kids get vaccinated. I’m calling anymore shutdowns easily continue wear masks avoid high risk situations like concerts crowded bars. “If customers die”? “If 30 percent students die”? 

*rolls eyes hard fall head* saying data say kids extremely low risk serious illness covid begin with? Like, think data doesn’t exist? fabricated? Really unclear highly doubt average parent going much help, neccessarily know much anything risks either guarentee making sure teen gets information need. Education school health whatever classes topic important, quite possibly education enforcement making sure doctors pharmacists properly educate girls young women properly risks. agree idk we’ll ever get 85. questions ok stall 75 cases pretty low, risks hospitalizations breaking system, deaths low.are going keep things place hoping 10% change mind, force (highly unlikely), say well chance overall point cons restrictions outweigh risks bill. vaccine free you. want insurance info file insurance companies cover administration, otherwise covered CARES act. receive bill pharmacy covid vaccine, violating federal law. doubt CVS would that. got lost arguments today. One mandatory vaccinations. give up. Lol sure it’s men mansplaining ok birth control pills also ok vaccines’ side effects? 
It that, “you’ve ignored risk bad girl, good girl say” feeling. Almost large commercial jets* recirculate air meaningful volumes run HEPA filters. Usually 50/50 mix. helps keep already low humidity dropping absolutely ridiculously low proportions. Composite planes like 787 actually high recirc mix (higher 50/50) keep humidity relatively high (for airplanes least). humidity comes entirely folk's breath. doubly low passenger count flights (the pax count actually used circ system estimate mix keep humidity right). 

Now, course, every time air recirculates, reduces proportion ""twice recirculated air"" half. plenty air lives multiple ""generations"" cycle. 

HEPA buzzword plane. HEPA might overkill, want unfiltered recirculated air blasting face. 


*Some smaller regional jets (e.g., CRJ200s) use HEPA filters. air vents brought outside none recirculated. They(CVS) billed insurance. believe policy different state state site site. think bill cost shot sure bill labor give shot. took wife city’s massive site ask anything ID

Edit: CVS billed $28.93 ICD10: Z23 CPT:0031A personally i've gotten fatter good you. 40 million might get even paid thought usa one countries didnt allow dual citizen? Maybe I'm misinformed. I'm UK/Aus citizen. many kids infected far? everyone declares pandemic lets virus run free many infected then? many deaths hospitalizations, MIS-C yes, long term effects too. deserve next pandemic covid vaccine free. Covid not. Go get vaccinated. required insurance get vaccine, it’s free CARES act. Sounds right. I'm lucky work, sign process made seem like insurance would paying something pocket. Got mine CVS. happens go school literature degree never really solve problems. knee jerk reaction simply say “well people shouldn’t anyway.”

As intellectual think thought process incredibly shallow. Instead rolling eyes maybe pay someone’s medical bills? need health insurance get free? Pfizer 3 weeks, AZ 12. others different well, rounded since can’t discuss second doses everyone, including slowest, gets second dose.

Also, priorities guess. question that, first doses allow adequate interim protection, stretch second dose (from 8 12 weeks) since it’s maybe safer 2x people one dose 3 months 1x two doses. Yeah, know it’s 2x precisely, depends rollout get idea. it’s still worth looking possibility. would still cautious. covid positive sub, number people reported getting covid twice second time symptoms severe. would expect red tape bill somehow/ way. amazed *actually free* got mine. thinking thing, 7M really small everyone know either way. Sounds like maybe kids never ride car bus, walk, get school. swim. ride bike. non-zero number die accidents every year. many need die care?!?!?11! Yes, it’s free. 14,500 25% flu deaths per year (‘19-‘20 season, per CDC). like said another post, going worry neighbors getting flu shot every year? 4x deadly COVID (Covid) vaccinated individuals.

Im saying doesn’t matter, I’m saying you’re vaccinated there’s reason worry someone street doing. started Disney World argument. get vaccine, go Disney live life happily finally forget pandemic. hope get it, want keep mask mandates permanantely, better wear mask put makeup Idiot. Seriously. bill insurance company administration shot. Insurance companies must cover it’s preventative care. i’m also confused says july 4th able “small gatherings”.idk we’re 75%+ vaccinated don’t see couldn’t full blown normal fourth july concerts full baseball stadiums packed bars People like spineless cowards reminded fact every day rest lives. Distance learning going anywhere. now. better find babysitters kids public school teachers. went state run site vaccine (NY) didn’t even collect insurance info. Don’t sweat it! That’s violation federal law. great point.  Oh see you’re saying. 

Good know that’s case NYC. Ought case Erie county. I’m from. still studied, currently seems low risk 6+ years without paying, somehow dinged credit score yet.

I could wrong, think medical debts sent collections get reported credit agencies. least that's told hospital fucked one bills incorrectly sent collections disputing it.  post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

everyone seems automatically assume it’s lack demand cause it’s conservative state idk based experience seems like it’s administration demand Calm amygdala, dude.

2. Cases children rising. Transmission happening sports starting noticed required testing.

4. Children getting sick continue vector illness. need lower overall stubbornly high level case can’t children keep spreading circulating virus.

Maybe fall won’t need masks, depends are. Making statement masks can’t required fall political move along lines saying vaccine passports won’t allowed, even though hasn’t discussed.

These political points made prematurely. keep wondering science way predict variant beats another variant population; fit? instance, would B.117 new one take dominant? Working chains, incessantly email, expecting us give shit. Probably never mentioned believe it. Healthcare got undoubtedly one complex important industries there, going ongoing battle long make things better. shots fully paid for, prohibited federal law charge recipient. “May”

(Also, way articles written makes sound like virus sort evil sentient being, consciously trying mutate nefarious purposes, bothers me. It’s way try ratchet fear, making sound like horror-movie monster.) Huh? Zoom school now... pretty sure zoom schools insist cameras on.

Also eight year olds like independently-studying college students. good luck getting first grader doesn’t know read “learn independently”, fuck LOL Refresh memory someone dying traveling? bieng sold INdia? name? brother getting tomorrow think-HELP would love see actual proof thing, hearsay reddit fearmongers.

Honestly, GAD, need stay away sub due rampant fearmongering. get COVID-19 briefings White House. literally.how disheartened would failed miserably two shots pinning hopes AZ JnJ.we’d feeling really dark place right today two options don’t disagree main points, multiple risk factors blood clots fall within demographics risk. knew issue AZ could show since similar technology would appreciated knowing risk ahead time.

It’s many communities art/music scenes destroyed. reason lockdown fanatics don’t care. Bells Palsy episode also corrected eventually trials 5 patients occurred  ya go smartass:  WTH zoom school? even need video chat see anyone video days studying. simulating typical class virtually, teaching kids learn independently.  basically don’t use pills hormonal reasons, like hormones way are.

Get vaccinated. enough people vaccinated, restrictions go away everyone cases plummet. Refusing get vaccinated virus goes away incredibly illogical thinking. answer zoom school? LOL Well, 70+ age group get 80+% vaccinated.

The 60+ group also high vaccination rate number still increasing. bill ***insurance*** cost administer. Per federal law, one pay much penny entire process getting vaccine driving clinic driving home. Expressing concern one thing, suggesting things going get roll eyes middle finger isn’t helpful get people listen things actually useful point (like getting vaccinated J&amp;J review it).

Novavax Valneva traditional vaccines.  HIPAA protects employer finding without permission. 

If employer requires vaccine, that's different. show proof vaccination leave. show proof employer actually require it, they'll fine. incorrect. Covid units capacity prefectures, hospitals generally. 


Osaka 210 beds covid patients, Tokyo around 500 think. Even go 100% mean medical infrastructure overwhelmed.


Now, lack beds covid patients another issue... Scummy Japanese medical industry basically refusing treat people risk. really sad. family friends India house warming party (smh). One people attended looking covid positive spouse. everyone caught covid one elderly ladies hospital oxygen

People actually idiots. meant educated middle class folk can’t get Covid shot, isn’t type vaccine. 3 million infections entire population. would need compare 12 deaths children age group.

Children also experience adverse effects, still know consequences long-covid children. know vaccine safe, possible adverse effects vaccine nothing compared risks covid.  Meanwhile formula 1 grid still isn’t cruel, daft. like Indian government allowing religious events political rallies. thought AstraZeneca shot one dose? Anytime see argument someone says “I don’t want pay people’s care”, immediately ask explain insurance works. aren’t even bad. Daily deaths circa 80% since January showing signs resurgence. case load high people dying, see worthwhile tradeoff stay open lots sick deaths, opposed staying locked maybe half death toll half spread. think indirectly seasonal England normally - summer people go open windows, stuff spread well. Winter inside shut windows, pub, spread stuff. colds flu etc. Deaths less reported weekend, completely unreported, get reported Monday appear statistics Tuesday. Presumably paperwork issues weekends holidays. UK messages average week smooth weekend reporting. Currently UK death rate running 234 deaths per week, 33.4 per cruel thinking Indian Gov wants people die thin population? Study also finds air lines don’t give crap people except wallets. vaccines (particularly mRNA ones) turning insanely effective!

Yeah, let's forget 6-9 months ago, bar vaccine getting approved set efficacy thought got lucky might get one 75%. Instead got two 95% bunch 75%+. Live free die Well comments suggests that’s getting angry. anti British racism affecting comprehension skills? 

Seems like also anti American, even bringing America this? 

You sound like sad nationalistic European probably try therapy fully support lockdowns point, option there? vaccines failed (Which think will), people supposed stay homes forever? many years lockdown many? another lockdown rule enforced, follow it, point agree vaccines basically end game. Many insurances cover ""preventative"" treatments cost. Like vaccines, COVID, things like flu shots. Check insurance. didn’t know free absolutely straight lied masking. admitted trying preserve medical mask supply.

They certainly don’t seem known doing.

Back envelope math tells surge medical demand alone overwhelm supply chain. seconds thought tells substantial fraction public call bullshit whole “masks nothing unless professionally fitted” thing.

So lie slow universal masking, make people resistant it.

That doesn’t seem like knew doing.

Neither deciding since haven’t proven covid airborne yet, we’re going assume isn’t.

Personally, working novel virus, I’d assume characteristics others family got information. every coronavirus airborne, seems like good starting point. Plus, way better figure isn’t lower precautions, rather admit months late.

My guess thought words “airborne virus” would cause people panic, refused admit it. early focus ventilation would huge effects. early decisions alter trajectory way later ones.

Overall, real problem unwilling say anything study proving it. example, repeatedly saying “the vaccine prevent transmission” instead saying “the vaccine almost certainly prevents transmission, don’t results back yet”.

So no, best tell don’t seem known doing.

Even now, CDC seems changing mind constantly what’s safe vaccinated people.

I’d commission reform. worry overall success dealing pandemic mask failures, public health community won’t introspection come Jesus style debrief. forget rare enough condition many doctors recognize what's happening, neither would patients. important keep mind 6 people _that know of._ also important keep mind 6 patients young women. drug treatment taking got vaccinated? That's publicly known, case, related, easy enough recommend users drug treatment get different vaccine.

If ignore everything else, assume 90% blood clot cases properly identified reported, third blood clot deaths identified (not unreasonable identified higher rate, unexpected deaths usually get investigated), 60 cases, 3 deaths. That's still 0.000882353% chance blood clot someone takes it, 0.000044118% chance death

Still, seems like pick Taiwan randomly. Since they've 1000 recorded cases, _of course_ recorded deaths would low. Thats nice thing hospitals overrun, case fatality rate stay ""relatively"" low, 1%, higher percentages listed. Even country things mostly control far, expect get covid-19 point never get vaccinated. British rags idea word ""fact"" constitutes. dont care claim first. farce pro-EU. that, farce. every british rag, like american ones, feels UK somehow criticized itsbpeers, jumps defend way hardcore nationalisr publication s. way is. simpy funny make example doctor weeks ago rediculing EU. J-Lo must incredible manager get big gigs. maybe 4 noteworthy songs uses ghost singers them. like say younger people going hospital, response ""well, lot older people already vaccinated."" makes sense. Like baseline hospitalizations need filled one way another. vaccine acceptance already sky-high, passports planned come well indoor hospitality open (outdoor hospitality indoor shopping re-opened), personally think necessary domestic use. ridiculous comment. best clearly isnt good enough then. lot useless leaders around world seems me. title suggest UK doctor first, doctor UK found link. read article it’s clear number doctors various nationalities came similar conclusion similar timelines, made public song dance fact. 

The Guardian probably EU friendly newspaper UK don’t trash suddenly anti European hurts fragile world view UK doctors couldn’t possibly also found link. notice call Oxford vaccine anymore. remember Boris thumping chest, making sure everybody knew vaccine Oxford. bravado swagger shrivelled away. shocking thing people like gone year without getting it. understand possible. Covid 19 low risk babies less &lt; 12 months. 

We already know this. comment incompetence.

The technical term means adenovirus replicate engineered cell line host cell includes parts viral genome. virus particles produced lack parts, infect cells, cannot replicate. way, vaccination cause propagating adenovirus infection. crisis proved need competent political leadership organizations like CDC NIH political interference whatsoever

Do believe scientists idea doing? straight lied? straight lied, would motivation that?

I disagree need look everything crisis inspect 9/11 commission style Antivaxxer scum. muscles felled disease. Motorcycle term. **S**tupidly **qu**ick **i**mminently **d**ead. think ""backronym"" though. I've heard started surfer circles abbreviation squirrelly kid. I’ve literally never seen happen 💁‍♀️ EU currently portfolio 2.3 billion doses several companies

The 1.8 billion top that. Even accounting boosters variants, extraordinary number population 450 million. Hopefully we'll able donate low income countries defeat pandemic globally. I'm sure rollout handled US Europe first people fully vaccinated people old people could explain lot. all. didnt say didnt need wear mask lol. also didnt say didnt NEED vaccinated. time being, adults option get vaccine. getting it. there's complications vaccines children virus itself, kids skip get solid mom dad grandma grandpa vaccinated everything ok!! Here's data Germany published Paul-Ehrlich-Institut safety reports. Unfortunately there's data CVST cases covid infected groups, vaccinated Robert Koch Institute, 14,381,068 vaccinations performed April 2, 2021, including 10,722,876 vaccinations Comirnaty, 713,067 vaccinations Moderna, 2,945,125 vaccinations Vaxzevria.  04/02/2021, 42 cases central venous/sinus vein thrombosis reported following vaccination Vaxzevria. Thrombocytopenia also reported 23 cases. one case central sinus vein thrombosis cerebral hemorrhage detected postmortem, platelet count could reliably determined.  seven cases involved women aged 20 63 years. men aged 24 58 years. Eight patients (5 women, 3 men) died. individual patients suffered sinus thrombosis thrombocytopenia vaccination, high platelet antibodies (PT4) detected, together clinical picture suggest clinical picture similar autoimmune heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (aHIT)-. aHIT, thrombosis occur even without administration heparin.  Paul Ehrlich Institute numerically case reports sinus vein thrombosis vaccination Vaxzevria women (83.3% vs. 16.7%), young women particularly frequently affected. However, women also vaccinated frequently men, according Robert Koch Institute.  women aged 20-59 years, significantly cases observed (n=33) would expected based background incidence.  cases sinus vein thrombosis reported vaccination Comirnaty. cases reported thrombocytopenia. Three women aged 34 81 years four men aged 81 86 years affected. number reported cases, taking considering doses inoculated compared expected Number sinus thromboses increased.  Morbidity Ratio, SMR, 23.57; 95% CI: 16.22-33.10). true men aged 20-59 years (SMR 27.20; 95% CI: 10,94-56,04). That's good, first I've heard CVT side effects mRNA vaccines, know many experts watching it.

This may dumb question, rate CVT world knew COVID-19? compare that, not, have? FR Massive respect someone explain az/jj vaccines similar blood clot rates Pfizer absolutely outcry Pfizer vaccines? come countries like Norway Denmark reporting deaths clotting Pfizer? come countries banning halting Pfizer compared az? 

Surely can't similar else Pfizer would paused right? they're correct.  study? Liberal scientists! trust it!

-you know Thank saying this!!! keep seeing touted everywhere, it’s false dichotomy that’s really useful discussion vaccine itself. Hate speech expert job US there's thing hate speech US law. dad talks like think legit messed kid almost passed thinking me. thought normal, couldn’t even realize disgusting got much older. 

One specific example remember family member side didn’t really know poor lots health problems. dads whole family lived sticks moved went college engineer thinks he’s hot shit earned money one take him. Well uncle whatever decides go Alabama football game, set dad reason. wasn’t even one lent money, grandparents. guess people get help others never allowed fun again. Start exporting then. felt like mild hangover next day got worse around late afternoon (about 28 hours later). I’d take sick day safe.  think lot people round 99% 100% minds realize 99% means 99%.  Well blame us? pay children, stay alive we're diabetic, get professional help, etc. exactly advertise free. It’s recognising risk groups. take large enough sample size, anything disappear background noise. start limiting things like under-30, taking birth control etc, rate different. appears give AZ non-risk groups, similar others, worse certain subsets people. Nonono, Astra Zeneca shit talked revenge brexit. makes sense. general agree need concrete plans get think picking date arbitrary goals based case numbers vaccination percentage soft general dates let people know might know public universities feel comfortable mandating vaccines full FDA approval, well. Ah thank revealing dude waste human life. absolute 0 person. Yeah, reduced cases death compared reduced number cases also important. vaccine necessarily prevents getting Covid. still infected, chances needing hospitalization dying way lower would face vaccinated. sole purpose vaccines, reducing hospitalization deaths. 

 

I'm gonna lie I'm bit afraid variants future, society I'm proud got vaccines working applied less year. 

 

I still months away getting vaccinated healthy 28yo Brazil, variant hitting hard, I'm hopeful. struggle anxiety fear getting needing assistance hospitals overcrowded, almost lacking medicine doctors nurses tired... private business want follow ADA regulations, it? I'm sorry, insane follow science. Mask mandates absolute last restriction lifted since wearing one doesn’t affect economic activity opposed social distancing, concerts, keeping restaurants closed 50% capacity whatever. Isn’t hard calculate risk? agree everything except comparison argument.

For might be. course, keep observing it. far vaccination history goes, heard adverse effects showing several months. would different covid vaccine? chances something adverse happening long time infinitesimal. virologist, cannot see logical interactions could lead effects long time. positive effect taking far outweighs it. Go poland.. Testing rest us. math check out.  number used would one fatality per one hundred million cases.  I'm pretty sure actual reality far greater.  
Besides, Covid brings many risks even die.  Lung damage, mental issues, chronic fatigue, loss taste &amp; smell, things run gamut inconvenient debilitating. biontech? ""These so-called breakthrough cases, defined positive Covid-19 test results received least two weeks patients receive final vaccine dose, represent 0.008% [the fully vaccinated Wall Street Journal article morning. 

I wonder much 5,000ish end hospital. qualify ""mass hysteria"" lots people making decisions unhappy with. I'm also pro-vaccine science teacher. I'm certain spun mainstream media PR department/CEO whoever developed AstraZeneca vaccine way partially recoup losses/hold onto market value stock exchange.

I think also done force countries taking vaccine. example, I'm Australian, news clotting hit, AstraZeneca preferred vaccine choice government due deal. changing used 50yo (which also understand - surely must still clotting risk older, mention everyone unique terms genetics fitness). bet AstraZeneca trying position Aussie government needs take previously agreed vaccine amounts.

There millions/billions dollars stake. Maybe I’m confused actual success metrics are. get bulk gains happen first shot, surprised see much downvoting idea track many people get both. also believe people inability comprehend life someone different life experiences. person 1 high risk could person 2 possibly see issue.  masks went away long time ago many areas. can’t say they’re going away anytime soon.

I’m certainly going wear mine anymore it’s longer required given I’m vaccinated. I'm much less likely get covid let everyone else take clot risk me. Yep, that's seen well (in different format). vaccine unquestionably worthwhile anyone 29; however, younger patients pediatric patients adenovirus vaccines may great tradeoff. You’re misunderstanding MHRA is. It’s medicines regulator. equivalent Europe EMA, throughout taken actions narrative time MHRA. equivalent European national advisory bodies JCVI U.K. rented 2 movies watch day got second pfizer shot assumed would stuck couch feeling sick day. seen many posts thought sure thing. Second day came literally felt 100% fine besides sore arm, still watched movies though. yeah may side effects also possible won't. Either way it'll soon! Yeah thought that. might explain AZ J&amp;J linked clots MRNA ones aren’t. really bad reaction traditional vaccine like really bad version disease, essentially said disease. COVID cause blood clots non-MRNA COVID vaccine. Politicians kids wanna deal kids home. Yes ever considered maybe sort birth control isn’t great first place. Kinda funny ‘male pill’ gets stopped trial phases due ‘too many side effects’, yet pill many women take effects yeah already pfizer moderna, covid dangerous week two it'll take source one take AZ now? gap narrowed, according Bloomberg, CA given 31 million shots. 40 million people, \~0.78 shots/person. NY given 15 million shots, 19 million people, \~0.79 shots/person. TX given 21 million shots, 29 million people, \~0.72 shots/person. 

The gap narrowed last two months, even today, NY given nearly 10% shots TX. 

I idea decided allocate shots, speculated based age population number people certain age groups. also better efficiency. Dallas nearly everyone wearing masks too. Austin people using “logic” fucking high vaccine risk all. Really? Sky high? haven’t even cleared 50%.   Thanks post, haven’t following case counts much lately, hoping we’d hit sort tipping point US similar Israel’s steep decline cases. Seems like US long plateau, hopefully changes near future. Indeed, apparently [the authors ""I think data say actually nothing AZ vaccine."" saying, statistical terms, “the death rate, conditional getting COVID full vaccination, identical death rate, conditional getting COVID without vaccination”. 

That may true, it’s worrying. That’s much lower chance getting COVID vaccinated. overall chance death much lower vaccinated, happen one people contracts COVID vaccination, probability death roughly same. use birth control exact reason. argument really weak.

I 24 years old take covid seriously, social distance, wear mask etc. risk getting covid dying bigger dying vaccine 100% use. AZ JJ ones avaibale sure, would take them. wait like two months get another vaccine without sideffects rather wait. super solid start pandemic last spring.

You mean even country, left Spahn power anything?  
   
Then got lucky, refused close borders neighbours anyway without consent. nicely cut while.  
  
And last summer - well, ordering vaccines might look like showing belief President Trump's plan.  
Better go without /s here. I'm second dose 2 weeks. continue respect regulations country, I'm done. best years life, I'm going hunker again. Headlines new oh sooo scary variants appear every day, never end. 100% right. ever type conversation allowed downvoted majority people want hear opposing positions. Instead attack label anti vaxer. follow science fits agenda people died side effects, well make excuses happened. deaths don’t matter them. even hope “republicans” die virus. scary time living many people lost sense humanity. Compassion rare. Women BC much higher rate get blood clots either AZ J&amp;J vaccines causing, nobody anything it.
What bullshit? would vaccinated people quarantine themselves? That's great Twitter thread, mandatory reading alongside posted article. remind whole ""he [Floyd] died fentanyl system"". Like feel like, open guy's comments... let's talk birth control rate causing blood clots. 1 1,000. 
But fine women birth control... double standard. get strand hair use DNA pattern transporter buffer revert non-infected selves? based heard, planning light day day 2nd shot, heard people getting butts kicked.

Went restaurant last night waiter said plan get really drunk day gets 2nd shot, wakes morning, sure side effects hangover. mileage may vary. 100 percent people alot places garunteed get vaccine tho? maybe still get proper fucking vaccine that's adequately tested. you’re waiting zero side effects vaccine type you’ll waiting long time. went clinical trials evaluate effectiveness safety.  could run clinical trials 5 years release vaccine still run unexpected side effects. best enroll participants broad spectrum people absolutely chance test possible scenarios. agree. I’m sure came death sole factor. Sure use whole population vaccinated J&amp;J shot denominator 6 7 million. 

Not 6 1.5 million. cant people understand subset people significantly higher risk?

Western thinking general big one-size-fits-all solutions &amp; discursive reasoning causes problems looking problems isolation. terms number deaths maybe. Maybe you’re one getting blamed people dying blood clots caused opposed blood clots caused force nature. hope makes full recovery. Strokes terrifying.  18+ 1 doses Saturday

this incredible local doctor's practise says still 80s.  
She'd bit wait here.  Anecdotally heard everything across board. literally side effects all... teeny tiny amount soreness arm, think needle puncturing skin. serious workout 2 hours shot never felt thing, soreness, aches, fatigue, etc. vague sense metallic taste mouth hours may bad coffee.

Talked young, fit guy gym yesterday said first shot made feel like flu 2 days he's dreading 2nd shot.

As far tell random place. He’s outspoken antivaxxer, anti masker around moron. reason he’s gotten pass he’s insanely good defensive player. also factor hormonal treatments, clotting disorder brain aneurysm risks developing clot Covid though, no? things apply situations (which do), risk getting clot Covid higher, means risk evaluation wrong way round.

Not trying shame taking one vaccine, saying.  oxygen situation much better since crisis Manaus earlier year, although frequent warning low levels hospitals. Supplies intubation equipment sedation drugs new crisis, reports Brazilian media hospitals able keep patients fully sedated intubation equipment, revolting authorities let happen.

So far seen news reporting Portuguese, closest article found talking new situation. know, it’s jut hit harder expected. 3 hour thing lab setting, like aerosolized virus airtight drum air movement found still viable 3-4 hours later. way simulates real world environment, especially outdoors. knowledge done studies closely match real world. quoting article. disagree article stack info we've given. Eradication going happen. financial reasons, Germany closed 20 hospitals since march 2020. ICU beds reduced 6000. mention 10000 emergency ICU available seven days, needed. whining much December ,when 5600 beds occupied (now 4500). think last bullet gun keep people accepting lockdown put homejailing. get car accident way vaccine COVID test end worse outcome either vaccine COVID. draw line? Yeah, Americans necessary culture think like that. Anecdotal evidence, 80% seemed fine 20% intense fever. Imo nice sick day case. That’s true reason looked OP’s post history see history antivax statements. Didn’t see anything glaringly antivax, far right, religious. So, gave benefit doubt basically ran trials enough people trial got COVID. compared many placebo many vaccinated. 

Doing way, lower higher community exposure rate change long trial takes complete. still get certain number infected people. sadly advice health advisors

Sure people hesitant large majority would still get Lmao vaccine free matter what! bill insurance company insurance, insurance, government pays. Yeah, heard Berset mention yesterday certain activities, like cardio, done without masks. get.

\- historical interpretation incorrect rather dichotomy actually spectrum. Droplets come many sizes like anything else, surface area mass determine relationship opposing forces gravity air resistance thus long object remain suspended far travel.  Additionally, question viral dose viability within droplets. sometimes is. Reddit always claiming mask work virus airborne, took CDC year admit same... Yeah affects everyone differently, hopefully don’t feel bad regardless congrats getting dose 2 soon! exciting! It’s free don’t insurance. pay 90$ COVID test cause insurance. Anyone know much going cost??? Well put. 

In addition, would add person getting COVID despite vaccination might independent propensity COVID kill someone.

A vaccine 95% efficacy means there's 5% chance shit you, keep masking even vaccinated. Compared others, no. surprised interaction work couple days ago this. Asked someone he'd gotten yet said ""nah, can't afford shit.""

In Maryland, register shot, first question whether insurance. Even though there's text page says recordkeeping purposes, wonder many people say ""nope, insurance"" sign out. it’s along, cases number isn’t always enough. need know age distribution cases. 

It’s understanding average age cases hospitalized dropped. 

Which, continue follow patterns data date, deaths won’t high new cases younger people. Also federal system doesn’t help rn one other. talk pause. Ah bad, nevertheless... compares well leaders. AstraZeneca already tested this. work. Good.

The risk kids always they’d spread adult. Adults vaccinated months, issue gone.

The risk kids alone far low justify mask mandate school. Yes, there's 100% chance catching vaccine give needle. Prepare worst, hope best  think joke state motto (live free die) absolutely false “every kid America lost year schooling.” It’s incorrect makes hard take anything saying seriously. schools around option person learning six months (with masks, kids don’t complain all). Even holdouts west coast waited longer everyone else mostly open person now. even think virtual isn’t good person (I agree), it’s thing nothing all. think it’s reasonable say didn’t learn much would normal year. It’s reasonable say lost year schooling.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* seem illiterate. article, post, discussing possibility B-351 starting spread *despite* existence 117, mass vaccination. 

And UK vaccines. using single doses AstraZeneca pop  two week-iversary since got second shot! doorknob going unlicked! Let's say 1 million people non vaccinated 1 million people fully vaccinated.

In non vaccinated group 10'000 people might get covid 100 might die (1% fatality rate according calculation).

In vaccinated group 100 people might get covid 1 might die (1% fatality rate according calculation).

So see flawed fatality rate might think working compare two see chance dying dramatically lowered get vaccinated.  Yes, J&amp;J pause AZ isn’t authorized. 

The whole thing politicized here, plus factors like people understanding it’s free charge lead think you’re right. US going get stuck around 60%. Cities higher, rural conservative areas lower.Anecdotally, It’s already easier get appointment red areas due lack demand. Health code violation serious = chains door. least civilized parts USA. Welcome! Good That's true all. case see far far numbers reported.

In city matter, they've reported 10 deaths COVID local news agencies quoting atleast 40 cremated COVID protocols.
Now I'm expert, I'm pretty sure would simply 10 deaths heart attack accident mid-large sized city given day.  don’t understand sentiment. specific say America? Like news hasn’t everywhere. You’d hermit know information. Don’t piss America cuz Reddit. outpacing every country YUGE margin Evidently 7 million Americans stupid. 210 million adults, it’s expected least many stupid people - nothing alarmed about. even bad financial positions. tiny county (they don’t even website) offered free bi monthly 2 hour cleaning service elderly, also come fill pill containers need that, among things. anyone elderly relative suggest call see services offer. tax dollars pay it. Today California, everyone 16 get vaccine. Even local Safeway starting administer now. It’s good day. Drivers Licences create two-tier society!

Wait guy hears billionaires. Correct. Article truly amazing, “Improving indoor ventilation air quality help us stay safe”. would known? Also would anyone 30 take AZ offered mRNA alternative? safety efficacy also slightly better. 

Not saying AZ bad valid, data looks bit sketchy without seeing hard numbers. Also might wildly change depending what's probability catching covid-19 first place. appears UK variant spreading quite quickly. Things going downhill rapidly fact apparent index cases crowded place people get drunk take protective measures.

To make matters worse, there're assh-- \*ahem\* irresponsible people actively sabotaged containment efforts witholding travel history, taking flights right positive test results.

Hang guys, we're arriving destination f\*\*ked guys soon. Agreed. Moderna. individual surgeon his/her preferences big factor price variation too.

Surgical supplies expensive fuck, significantly moreso others thing.

For example, gallbladders specifically (usually done laparoscopically) pretty much every laparoscopic instrument set lap scissors it. Many surgeons like feel one comes set, opt single-use disposable lap scissors needs opened separately. alone add hundred dollars bill.

Rinse repeat every action every surgery inexpensive way get job done vs fancy toy costs fuckton see total pricetag varies much.

Source: I'm surgical tech, see shit every day. Technically would still 45th president reelected. preprint pretty big caveats discussed author paper mentioned press conference think data say actually nothing AZ vaccine Oxford defending Oxford vaccine. Gotcha, thank you! Well think dumb comprehend people like charge, work So, able walk drug store US purchase this? Unless I’m misinterpreting you’re saying, Trump would still 45th president re-elected. would considered 46th president. Gotcha, thank much clarification. Social media pandemic itself, informational tragedy commons. listen media agendas. issue kids never they’d get sick, they’d spread adult. adults vaccinated, little I’d like see mamas continue least places lot kids

Honestly seems cruel. There’s reason UK doesn’t recommend masks school anyone 11. risk kids low justify don’t want get point high risk kids’ families feel stuck either risk missing education

That’s already situation. Virtual schooling effective slightest.

Every kid America already lost year schooling. year count things they’ve forgotten.

The question much want set back? read fine print even allow sports singing inside without mask. Yeah thought super spreading cool kids do? Paywall likely get hit falling coconut get blood clot AstraZeneca. looking like covid vaccine become annual bi-annual vaccine (like flu shot).

What data coming suggest that? Question: know Pfizer 90% efficacy whatever. also know takes 2 weeks full protection kick in. vaccine 90% effective people full protection 2 weeks 90% effective among everyone took vaccine regardless many weeks it’s since second dose Right, get car regular basis? Use gas stove? million higher risk things us simply ignore stats on? care way dying cars? Im curious type blood clots caused mrna vaccines. every source states cause serious clots stated exact type clot AZ. theyre causing similar clots COVID Id argue theybare still safer adenovirus vaccines. Moderna also reported analysis vaccine cause specific clots. 

I agree adenovirus vaccines unusually bad press low efficacy came out. teuly cant compare results efficacy one study another different variables. so? Herd immunity eventually kill virus completely

That really seem happening Brazil instance, lots re-infection cases. Hard say sure though. death worst case scenario, think. 562,000 people died, think getting shot might something fellow man. It’s women take birth control, cause blood clots own. vaccine effecting females menstrual cycles. got kicked Covid vaccinated sub, I’m anti vax, that’s what’s happening. big question too. People going happy can't get booster shot simply initially got 'wrong' vaccine. People make assumption, evidence vaccines effective every variant? effective mean prevent hospitalisation. Apparently compatible Pfizer mRNA means proper study certainly annecdotal account working many endo cerebrovascular neurosurgeons, significant increase number aneurysms clots since covid came around. Clippings coilings overall surgery numbers gone down.

If already risk current issues think fair assume risk would increase even covid. kind damned do, damned situation.  Thanks I'll edit comment, read assumed pertained AZ. I'm well aware that. make decisions every day. There's great difference giving vaccines potential causing serious harm healthy individual compared treating sick patient. risk may worth society (in case), may worth individual. seen lot people mention factoring undermining confidence vaccines, thing really gets me. already many people skittish getting them, media breathlessly reporting everything could possibly go wrong, helping persuade right direction. 

How many people die can't get handle fast enough? fear we're plateau efforts soon enough. used sure! women use birth control monitored offered Pzifer Moderna. that's still ridiculously cheap. probably paid petrol drive vaccination centre vaccine cost. 

I see point bickering $2 $3 cost economy one person stay work lockdown many times that. US stimulus bill $2T, $6000 per American. really matter vaccine costs $2 $20 even $200 compared that. 

One day ICU costs £1000 UK. UK got priority getting AZ vaccine paid $1 per dose, definitely worth it. That’s 1 million families suffering... really hope get soon Yeah it’s almost like getting coronavirus bad. think point it’s going like flu, never really goes away even though people get immunised catch survive (thousands die still) there’s herd immunity makes disappear. I'm pro-vaccines well. think vaccine statistically positive force overall community, people suffering side effects much better community COVID left alone affecting many people.

But given individual, risk negligible, gain extreme. gain especially high remaining confined waiting little get shot safer vaccine option.

My parents go first shots AstraZeneca. mom bad day, like many people, recovered perfectly next day. dad shot recovering bad bruises thighs. bruises tripled volume, got extremely painful week started go back normal. crippled period time, parents scared hell. know anecdotal evidence, yeah first person know took vaccine got really bad side effects, hard biased.

My advice: take AstraZeneca you:
- Can't get another vaccine soon,
- perfectly good health bruises, recent surgery, factor increases risk side effects.

Otherwise wait, wear mask, stay home careful, take safer vaccine get chance. put anyone risk community strictly respecting guidelines get vaccinated, compromising community potentially avoiding complications. anti vaxxers find different excuse... bad business. 

stop hysteria. Surely get AZ? keep wearing mask social distancing, that’s would personally situation since working home, give months I’m sure they’d suitable vaccine choice available Yes, case capital's hospitals running low drugs needed treat patients, use similar ideal drugs, mixing drugs on. worst though proper medications sedate people going intubation. 

Not many cases happening, reports since yesterday hospitals Rio intubate people diazepam morphine instead proper medications sedate people relax muscles, fully aware happening. even need hands tied, basically torture trying keep alive. 

 

We're dark place Brazil hope help countries give come us soon, anyone decides help, despite horrible president have. would important save lives, reduce general transmission infection Covid breed new variants could dangerous rest world too. thought people experiencing breakthrough infection possibly people risk factors cause weakened immune system, may need supplemental oxygen treatment. Question: know Pfizer 90% efficacy whatever. also know takes 2 weeks full protection kick in. vaccine 90% effective people full protection 2 weeks 90% effective among everyone took vaccine regardless many weeks it’s since second dose Vaccines weird given perfectly healthy people, theory. Don’t underestimate unvaccinated folks blind faith positive future outcomes. medicine presumably taken counter already-existing problem. Due number variants lower effectiveness vaccines them, possible COVID become similar flu, recurring vaccine tailored variants time. feel like COVID probably kicked mRNA vaccine research potentially decade. get basically blank cheques whatever wanted make vaccine come faster, got crazy data happens large amounts people vaccinated, possible side effects. Lol op part Reddit’s 1% job pushing type shit US, pretty much ""not take J&amp;J vaccine get Pfizer/Moderna within weeks"". areas, get day appointment.

Only hang J&amp;J one shot, people may still prefer one get one right (e.g. homeless populations). Want expand that, Dwight? That’s great don’t even know long immunity vaccines going last. said among first group healthcare workers get Pfizer, would taken one time knowing risks, choose one wait vaccine isn’t causing blood clots. 

“Getting back normal” also pipe dream, best settle stable “new normal” &amp;#x200B;

To win lottery ticket one million. Buying 50 tickets give 50% chance winning.

the Az vaccine increase change blood clot 1/8. actual chance blood clot? Refer lottery ticket example. Ack. Lets say *the vast majority Americans interested welfare*, I, one, working clinic *help others* staying home otherwise *mitigate risk others well myself*. Surprised see top comments pro-vaccine article nuance reddit. 1/8th less chance getting clots COVID isnt super reassuring get parents AZ shot, especially arent going outside much wait Pfizer Moderna. Well yes, people stupid. Vaccines failing. That's going strategy everywhere - think eventually places (temporarily) eliminated open cases... well, I'd like see get everyone countries board.

Elimination global strategy, *always* cases. 8 times likelihood get clot COVID. prerequisite catch COVID, proper social distancing masking done low, hit unlikely side effect.
Vs
AstraZeneca prerequisite taking vaccine. immunity eventually kill virus completely

This true. I’m seriously considering this. Except it’s gonna take 64 hrs get home :( Ah yes choice thing appointments come right. highlighting availability, choice apologies. think poster means ""efficacy"" making mistake comparing published efficacy numbers vaccines even though explained numbers can't compared unless two vaccines tested trial. OP's study literally providing evidence say know of. Please take minute read least abstract results sections.  Surely point link immune response spike protein (regardless whether vaccine covid) causes issues. Therefore I'd guess vaccines covid cause issues regardless designed them. RNA vaccines may different ellicit different type immune response, I'd surprised same.

 


Get vaccines. India simply many impoverished people COVID restrictions. Lockdowns require governments support people India capable best years. provide link J&amp;J effectiveness preventing hospitalizations? fear another anti-vax nurse well also dumb people think immune right away getting shot. truly making data driven decisions risk, would seeing following policies: fully vaccinated people whatever want. masks, distancing, nothing. growing scientific consensus says vaccinated persons contract spread covid (the likelihood extremely small). 

And ***I***, also performs complex risk assessments environmental field, correctly understand stores, concert venues, clubs, bars restaurants access high resolution data allows adequately determine likely contribute localized outbreak due vaccinating isn't. places would filled irresponsible types lie say ""yea totally got it, yup"" really anti-vax nutcase barely 1/3 country vaccinated.

Lol, advocating ***vaccine passports*** now? Seriously give strawman arguments. Yep, effectiveness preventing even asymptomatic cases (assuming high enough vaccine uptake) mean basically able kill viral spread within population. way gain foothold. *efficacy meant known occurrence CVT mRNA vaccines consistent background rate, though study seems say higher, [contradicting observed health paper actually study frequency AZ vaccine. lift numbers EMA, rest EMA numbers would say CVTs much lower mRNA vaccines, seems bit nonsensical comparison. live hair follicle. Oh, good point. It’d nice see gender data broken see %s. would booster shots work get Moderna initially? would compatible covid19 vaccine?   Yeah I’m calling bullshit Pfizer causing blood clots none reported American health officials especially study run vaccine maker who’s vaccine causing blood clots. slow start, seems picking speed. Initially eligibility groups 5 years given one week time. (85-80, 80-75 next week, etc) like every half week right now. Watch out, mods delete comment saying wear mine outdoors.

I'm sure mandated definitely enforced. Thank you! media around topic complete garbage. Because, according graphic, Canadian woman taking birth control pills (1290 + 900 + 4) 2194 / 1 mil chance getting blood clot. compounding categories, yet media spins separate things. time talk someone worried rare thing happening, bring car accidents. statistic lot people think about. friend mine caught covid pretty bad posting Facebook Twitter masks work wore mask every went still caught (and went everywhere-I almost feel like trying catch purposely). someone wrote masks carrier covid spread virus went nuts 🤦‍♂️ I’m sure saying AZ getting Pfizer months option U.K. women 30 given choice vaccine take; really don’t know would happen someone else said they’d take mRNA one. *Michigan enters chat* Imagine doinf elections, census much easier guess we’re lucky it’s rolled out?

The key luck, domestic production producing enough keep supply demand. countries domestic production may also export obligations thus can't take care exclusively first. Two people 80+% immunity better one person 95% immunity, interest reducing susceptible population fast possible many countries opted extend time doses. want to, to. going lie, read comments made Americans showing lack understanding vaccine production country anti-export legislation massive hand successful vaccine roll out, grating. like 197 million vaccines given right? many fully vaccinated? 197 million still like 0.002% [adults least one dose far people don’t seem get low risk personally worried Covid, given choice, likely choose better vaccine. 

Pfizer/Moderna higher effectiveness come bad press. anyone actually say choice AZ one choosing AZ? offers advantages. 

I pro-vaccine. People also need understand wanting get best vaccine crazy concept. fat helps lot think it. Japan older population old age much risk obesity more. although smoking declined quite bit less problem nowadays, long ago used smoke way Americans.  article UK irrelevant though since talking vaccine general article relevant Australia based right now. Moderna Pfizer vaccines completely different AZ J&amp;J ones (mRNA vs Viral Vector). far know evidence blood clots mRNA vaccines. understand vaccines less protective variants still protective, low risk group take whatever booster available variants can. everyone eventually get infected, virus stay.

How so? Herd immunity eventually kill virus completely, concluding ""everyone eventually get infected""? I'm assistant teacher elementary school, kids remind every day much hate wearing can't wait wear anymore... tell wear want get trouble, that's it. take immediately leaving school ground go play friends crowded park next school. ""efficiency"" mean context? bottle episode know friend told said mothers work offering everyone’s family members free also (she works nursing home), said “so guess I’ll go since it’s free.” 

I like dude went mass vaxx site town free lmao 

He like haven’t looked. We’ve known covid causing clotting issues early on. think compare risk covid symptoms risk vaccine effects. Anyone brain immediately realize vaccine approved public use safe enough provide favorable results comparing risks associated covid versus vaccine. SC resident here..... health department (DHEC) actually done tremendous job whole time.... despite pro-Trump politicians. openly contradicted Governor many times far.

Although suppose 200 million exposed covid. basically 7 outcomes. 

1. get vaccine never get covid - live
2. get vaccine get covid recover - live
3. get vaccine dont get covid - live
4. get vaccine get covid recover - live
5. get vaccine die brain clot - die
6. get vaccine die covid - die
7. get vaccine die covid - die wanted accurate, would also take account delay reported cases (getting symptoms+ test results takes time), somehow figure effect vaccinated would getting tested COVID infection, make general point well. az effective new uk variant pfizer is, ger az jab? [Our analysis suggests high adherence mask wearing could key factor reducing spread COVID-19. association high mask adherence reduced COVID-19 rates influence policy makers public health officials focus ways improve mask adherence across population order mitigate spread That's insane lady 100% wrong. gyms operate like clubs even cults sometimes opposed gym anyone walks workout leaves.

COBRA KAI NEVER DIES! original trials 90% 2 weeks, later studies Israel bit lower, 70-80% depending severity illness. Still seems like massive overreaction. pause women 18-60, leave open everyone else? plenty men older women still vaccinated risk elevated covid. 

Even women 18-60, risk covid still real. 

How many people estimate delay would kill covid? disruptive propaganda use effectively life-saving vaccines used product service.

Or idea, hypothesis, political theory, social movement belief. 4 million half million subjects means 2 cases. would rely much results. fact *still* told/reminded masks work year later comical point. 🤦 Study yet peer reviewed. Stupidity fear mongering contagious hand. heard may cultural thing, older population UK trusts government health system more.

Let's say trust government run high parts US. Except that's efficacy calculated trials. looking absolute risk, efficacy reported relative risk. like unvaccinated population odds contacting COVID period time 10% vaccinated 0.5% meaning vaccinated group 95% less likely infected unvaccinated given exposure. Maybe stupid weird question but: often haemorrhoids, risk developing brain clots (by vaccine) take AstraZeneca? Exactly point. AZ vaccine safe efficient well ones.  I'm saying vaccine safe claiming know safe literally protocols observe changes parameters may lead unexpected outcomes (i.e. age ) bit selective. waiting line review

I would think given enormous inconvenience Covid causing globally could bump line bit... love devolved pissing match deadly: vaccine virus. gongshow.  Chip away?

I think mean microchip.

It’s part plan. far cases among 20-49 crowd 65+, even though far illnesses 65+. Generally older group vaccinated younger.

This also means case among young person far less serious older person, might cases far less hospitalizations fatalities.

The younger people also becoming immune exposure. Whenever people outraged beach house parties happy fact indirectly increase herd immunity. 40 year old male twice likely die Covid 40 year old female. women prioritized early, could possible many men aware increased risk, especially given fact national leaders high fiving unmasked bragging 'immunity'. Sure, go it, ignore mass vaccination sites. Normal occurrence CVT .5 100K people, 4 per million expect without vaccine. Likewise, occurs women men. 

For Covid, 39 per million (per article). Magnitudes higher. like HELL YES CDU MIGHT FINALLY GONE! systematic review many studies [better scientific single report morning news show looked 262 people. can't even find actual study peer reviewed. according Denmark, problem, bring AstraZeneca doses Brazil dangerous would know now.

This simply true. Hey, I've seen one! don’t know herd immunity end all, final goal sure. 
Along way ever increasing vaccination rates help chip away new infections. 
Otherwise agree! I’m going throw too. People average become lot less careful they’re vaccinated, meaning vaccinated people may higher exposure covid opportunities infection. 

Here’s study 2007 vaccinations cause people take fewer preventative measures: think correlation two could extend beyond personal immune factors. would thing vaccinated people would much less likely get Covid tests asymptomatic, means incidence “infection” probably way higher 5,800 number, ratios symptomatic, hospitalized, die infected way lower measured.  Fantastic news, vaccines working really well. Huh, I'm genuinely shocked Merkel vaccinated months ago, given leader country *and* 66 years old. I'd figure would put front line. agree saying, it’s apples apples. need consider chances getting infected like said. However also need consider complications COVID, blood clots. Considering that, make decision get shot pretty easy. comment linking dailymail.co.uk automatically removed source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Bill Gates strong proponent IPR even exceptional situations these, really surprising. done lot good developing countries, case I'd strongly disagree him. need vaccinate people

but that's already doing? can't vaccinate get got second Moderna shot yesterday. I’ve never happy feel like shit. Looking forward booster fall, side effects damned. mean countries using can't correct too.

For Poland (15 daily deaths per million people last 7 days) decision Norway (around 0.6 daily deaths per million people last 7 days, i.e., 25 times less).

Other countries, like US, point between. US however swimming mRNA vaccines, Poland isn't, wonder US big rush use viral vector vaccines either. That's pretty simple thing find out, would take lot work. pretty much go day day, look number vaccinated people infected vs non vaccinated, adjust relative % population.

My point think I’m alone thinking certain settings don’t lend well mask mandating Stay safe there! I’m worried Brazil!! classic trolley car problem CDC. nothing, 10,000 people die. Pull lever, 5-10 people may die. chose nothing, make difficult choice risk accountability.

We need complete change leadership philosophy going survive next pandemic - may worse. actual Oxford press release: like found true going make lot people look stupid. new variants, Brazilian one, demolishing younger folks. Maybe point death, extreme sickness long lasting respiratory issues. 

Anyone given option, honestly, like JJ vaccine, rarity clots doesn’t justify shutting greater population. 6 people 7M Totally, people need remember reflective people. people engaged things. thought saying like birth control, covid cause rare brain blood clots, would false.
Covid causes rare brain blood clots vaccine does. Hopefully keep people vaccinating. Since AZ currently paused young people makes sense save available Biontech vaccines come sets look ten times better took place ten years Kirk's Star Trek?! That's problem prequels. written source, I’m stylist cutting doctors/nurses/research teams New England area pandemic one things looking last weeks. 35 year old female PCOS irregular periods steady cuts asking stuff. say it’s safe take shot rare get clot either birth control vaccine happening looking it.  Yes. much so. Although still rely quick testing, diagnosis availability. seen vaccines, availability everything. Personally legal documentation allows immigrate Japan. right work. Foreign travel allowed Japanese citizens come go please countries world, even tourists. Japan really cared spread covid would allow this, would take actions domestically. taking seriously home vaccinating well. got first dose Moderna last week.

If wait next week (around two week threshold kick in), ""safe"" would visit another individual currently fully vaccinated? I'm definitely aware I'm fully protected without second dose, may privilege waiting specific meeting happen. argument gets made lot unfortunately quite shortsighted. 2-4 weeks US supply make quite difference lot countries struggling supply surging cases currently. sooner start exporting better.

How summer 2021 looking?

Asked sees summer season looking like Market Square Day large scale events, Sununu said, “I really mean it, plan big, plan big.”

He asked businesses citizens think things two months now.

“Everyone wants vaccine going absolutely fully vaccinated … everyone wants vaccine get system now,” Sununu said. “Our case numbers going up, think, April even early May, fatality rate down.”

He predicted COVID case numbers “come drastically May” June “very low case numbers, low fatalities, fully vaccinated population … lot cash people’s pockets.”

“They want vacation, want vacation didn’t get 2020 word New Hampshire’s place be,” said.

He also encouraged communities “plan big you’re planning parades festivals, don’t think like it’s April 14, think like it’s July 4th.” Same, gotta get summer body ready. gotta tell you, muscle memory thing. Muscles waking hibernation. like starting scratch. Thank you. don’t written source I’m hairstylist one clients one editors New England journal medicine. I’ve cutting hair outside whole pandemic last haircut weeks ago mentioned issue hoping gets sorted fast enough it’s change women’s opinions shot. NE fucking REPRESENTING, sheesh. Feels good live CT (our officials great job throughout tbh, feels weird complimenting are) popped trials think gets ignored 'too good true'. 'A simple nasal spray prevents Covid damage? Pfft! Trump's injectable sunlight?!'. think obvious (for AZ J&amp;J vaccines) benefits outweigh risks.

But still leaves question, *which ones COVID-19 vaccines* best side effect profile.

I understand currently would impractical right away pull vaccines show downsides. side effects minor enough, want keep ball rolling.

But long run, think good pay attention vaccines best. Gradually move better better vaccine selection.  says right article thay coronaviris causes rare blood clots 8 times vaccination. read article? 5m India never arrived believe USA extra doses  Ahh. went ""not even wrong"" plain wrong. “Bullshit claims” saying data isn’t there? It’s made up? really, really butthurt risk kids low? disagree. think would seen coverup sort. fun skiing outweighs risk. don’t think benefits going maskless outweigh risks yet. numbers continue going vaccines become available kids? Sure. currently risk outweighs benefits, particularly children health condition puts higher risk.

I’m even willing say might point benefit without mask outweighs risk fall. don’t know right now, think it’s foolish Florida go ahead say can’t requirement. currently variants require boosters.

I'm sure argument here. Letting rip certainly covid zero, guess I'm glad dropped useless goal. Well, do, pride cometh fall. compassion, feel others pain sadness though own. God made purpose...to *help* needy, suffering, ignorant, alike....even you. people! Female late 20s, got vaccine 12 hours news came clots pause. I've extremely anxious past two days unproductive work, thinking every little pain pinch feel body blood clot. thought would less anxious getting vaccine, endure weeks (or more). think ever get anti-mask stuff. absolute worst case scenario mildly inconvenienced mask useless. That's worst case. get opposition lockdowns restrictions economic impact people jobs masks? get it. Looking local ICU data, doubt people broad age category 40-59 gaining representation % ICU, people 60+ dwindling, makes sense people next level risk exposed public jobs starting take greater representation. Added this, 20-39 age category flat % representation pre-variant now. 

It true getting sick, affecting younger people older people and, fact, composition remained similar pre-variant cases. still sensible vaccinate older populations younger populations, especially area vaccinating population represented ICUs. throw immune compromised people healthcare workers like high level exposure, increased risk death cohort even larger. access raw data could even mean vaccine drops death rate infected cohort. 85+ dies rate 75+ on. ""The issue factual report,"" said Sarah Roberts, information studies professor UCLA. ""But people reading report either deeply-held preconceived notions meaning lack appropriate context receive information.""

Yes, precisely, “weird”. going bet minority say family got 90 year old grandfather infected, bribed bed space, want money back since didn’t live long hospital... Birth control others higher instance clotting, super rare type pretty much german politicians vaccinated, priority group 3

That's takes AZ, know AZ 101% safe. fair COVID vaccine. going back normal fully vaccinated, literally point. unheard mixed vaccines produce combined stronger response. time trials finish many nations already committed double jab course. i'm sure would like many willing take risks challenge trials... actually much information side effects besides what's reported... know manufacturing defect medications reaction new variant? know going get worse?

this health organizations behave.. react new information assess it.... different recalling foods listeria.... i'm sure many people would take risks contanimated food especially they're pregnant take risk readily available alternatives?

I don’t actually think that, wouldn’t 100% surprised either Something add here, yesterday news Denmark stating risk blood clots AZ 1 40000 certain age group. Granted know number accurate either considering Denmark suspended good must good reason so. polls 2016 extremely accurate. problem actually understand them. got vaccines Washington state never mention insurance, period. Think Ireland country mandatory hotel quarantine Europe far it’s absolute shambles.

People threatening bring court let out, sports teams given exemptions even though stated “no exemptions would made” hotels overbooked people coming without even go hotel rooms. Prof forgets vaccine huge delivery delays countries like Denmark choice vaccine moment. AZ delivered limited number doses Denmark deliveries far behind schedule. 

The delay vaccination program caused using AZ perhaps even single digit days groups extremely low mortality. 

I agree it’s good vaccine, countries like Denmark Norway it’s unreasonable evaluate vaccine decide use vaccines. still study COVID-19 LOL need educate guy 60 year-olds get mainly Astrazeneca Germany free matter what, certain sites (for sure pharmacies) supposed take insurance info still billing. chain, someone uninsured, ask state ID number social security number get audited paid insurance all. Coworker wife got second vaccines (Moderna) 5 weeks ago. positive covid today. It’s especially frustrating us followed guidelines beginning. part others don’t theirs, it’s easy find mentally fed situation. Even side effect two orders magnitude worse currently appears, it’s *still* net benefit continue inoculating people. 

Furthermore, clots far occurred women 50. Recommend pausing vaccine women 50, keep going everyone else. *We cake eat too.* florida, free told yesterday unless insurance 128$ guess I'm getting fields work may require future (medical, military, etc). since still EUA areas shortages they're probably playing safe holding requiring now. It’s like conditioned expect pay healthcare ""Some doses unused"" mean vaccine hesitancy high, means point people wanted rush get right away gotten it. area point people gung ho needed wait convenient one reason getting it, going steady stream vaccines while. course wish people would get asap, ultimately going see lot people vaccinated.

First, compare blood clot data people vaccinated Moderna US data people vaccinated AZ Europe - latter conduct analysis simply cited data EMA. That's necessarily correct statistical standpoint.

Also, nowhere study provide breakdown age, except unvaccinated cohort. 

All all, study risk CVT people COVID vs. vaccinated people, little comparison different vaccines. Didn’t orange satan initiate healthcare pricing transparency actions? part healthcare reform pushing long? surprised too. Particularly country, health minister upset EU's comments AstraZeneca proeminent medical experts made unpleasant comments hundreds people die every year secondary effects various medications, hundreds deaths vaccine big deal. was, still am, extremely angry comments. good considering roster anti-vax (Nia Jax starters). Nations invested vaccine get cheaper, also different contractors making vaccine differing costs. Naturally volume cheaper produce smaller volumes. 2% known CFR, presumed IFR insane look state United States declare covid response ""it worked"". idea non-United States comment means. 2% known IFR presumed CFR That's period 10 years tho something take almost every day. 

And point government promoting vaccination group would similar levels dangerous even dangerous supposed protect from, seems quite unethical. Try billions... we’ll seeing remains beaches next 100 years dream day country filled educated, rational, logical people like you.

Even indian one dont even know name approved like 2 countries. think two options would blessing some. Michigan 10th 50 states population. would definitely call small save one person banning it, wouldn’t ban it?

Definitely not, extreme risk aversion completely opposite every area life (including covid restrictions) goes rational risk/reward logic. would hope next year need god help us anyone's track extend thing 2022 Florida. believe cases occur 5-16 days shot, longest suspected case (not confirmed) 19 days, that's AZ JnJ likely similar, would stop worrying entirely 3 wks. That's good point. Looking pics people ""socially distanced"" past year amazing much 6 feet looks like 3.... thing county asked name appointment registered under. even ID. need to. Even worried billed addressed used registration, I'm sure mass vaccination event could run without asking either. think might slightly smaller unemployment levels would nearly high. Since many people weren’t working able go protest. 74 deaths/5800 infections many people got 2 shots?

There 77 million people got fully vaccinated article report exact number people article includes. 

So also important records 100k fully vaccinated people 10 million fully vaccinated people. 

I could get information article, anyone get? Younger women got blood clots AZ. Seemingly older women also less risk like men. comment pointed comparing number ""deaths serious side effects"" ""deaths"" concluding X likely die. Surely side effects much common deaths. You’re assuming disagree don’t. Thank much. got people talk then. Problem number explicitly disagrees EMA's estimate data have. Certainly number plausible average full population.

Yes, 100% 67% according 4 days infection typical time symptom onset (day 5), probability false-negative result infected person decreases 100% (95% CI, 100% 100%) day 1 67% (CI, 27% 94%) day 4. day symptom onset, median false-negative rate 38% (CI, 18% 65%). decreased 20% (CI, 12% 30%) day 8 (3 days symptom onset) began increase again, 21% (CI, 13% 31%) day 9 66% (CI, 54% 77%) day 21.""

This older study, seen newer study saying get tested day symptom onset, accuracy goes 90%. Username checks out. one person died 6 million doses. I'm sure fine. Lolol, private business wants deny goods services someone unvaccinated, every right Delta least keeping middle seat blocked May wow got fast went?? shots wait 20-30 minutes Vaccinated people slew older especially March Idiots number beds relevant factor anymore, people would work care around beds quit, suffering, died noone protected sufficiently. Agreed. least push back two days? reality chance avoiding dying COVID five thousand times greater chance getting blood clot. 

Not young, healthy female. Hardly anyone fits description dies COVID hand really overrepresented among got blood clots AZ. ""He said first repeal would mask mandate""

This last restriction go Brag away dude. UK heavily criticized well. sister law told wife anyone died heart attack killed car accident listed covid death inflate numbers. opposite appears happening. believe? /s Problem hospitals NJ charge administration fee like $50 shot. 

It’s price don’t talk about. I’ll still clean phone every one two days. Sounds like good idea regardless. remember reading antivax bullshit people somehow shedding viable live virus vaccines. wackjobs believe they're going get full covid spike protein, could infect others vaccine. Ironically, often people tell worry virus wear mask. Anytime article says “we don’t know what’s it” “it contains metal particles” assume it’s misinformation promoted deliberately misleading scumbags.

If done effectively life-saving vaccines done product service. best friend’s stepdad got vaccine catch corona it’s within like week something exposed elsewhere. assume happened coworker well. quite high, seem many Michigan Oregon much smaller population. Maybe counting differently. see argument someone says “I don’t want pay people’s care”, immediately ask explain insurance works.

Exactly! I've saying years! ""I want pay people's care"" completely nonsensical argument, even ignore utter selfishness it. exactly insurance works!

Ugh, frustrating. Meanwhile, people needlessly suffering dying preventable conditions. Canada, currently spacing doses 4 months apart (unless immunocompromising medical conditions) enable faster rollout. gap probably shortened supply pick up. ""Pausing vaccine might rarely kill people decrease vaccine hesitancy"" weirdest idea I've seen pandemic. anyone saying ever actually met vaccine hesitant people? way likely cause vaccine sceptics suspicious vaccine. 

Do seriously think number vaccine hesitant people see suspensions vaccine caution decide take outweighs number people hear snippet news authorities suspending vaccine decide take vaccine ""just case""? 

This seems obviously ridiculous - course going decrease confidence vaccines (this exactly what's happening US right J&amp;J suspension). want then? expectation? leave capacity limit dont intend restrict capacity saying 100% isnt always true?? 

In analogy left part every car go 40. cars go 75? 90? saying go 40 speed limit isnt removed?? makes sense. two different restrictions. impact eachother doesnt mean same. Looks like yoga studio NBA going big PR event players got vaccinated? happened that? TLDR american healthcare crock shit Duh.. 
study finds social distancing limit spread free virus.
Study finds flying packed Airbus A380 higher infection rate Cessna 401 Yeah pause incredibly stupid govt’s part. Tons people already super paranoid vaxx Get vaccinated ASAP first vaccine available you. trials results necessarily comparable took place different regions different times.

In direct side-by-side comparison, AZ Pfizer produced level antibodies, AZ superior cellular response. See real life data, UK reported single dose AZ slightly out-performed single dose Pfizer preventing infection elderly. See ""The investigators found one dose Pfizer vaccine 57% 61% effective preventing symptomatic COVID-19 4 weeks AstraZeneca vaccine 60% 73% effective.""

This may better comparison trials UK used two vaccines nation time, fairer head-to-head comparison. look forward seeing 2 dose data (not available yet UK largely delayed second dose) think Covid likes too. got first Pfizer shot two half weeks ago, I'm getting second shot Monday. still bruise first shot. anyone else bruise lasted long? seek medical attention? Almost adults get shot summer. expect Canada/Usa borders open summer proof vaccination. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Trump can't isn't. Precautionary shutdown. really cynical reporting CBS. study's main takeaway clearly CVT clots common COVID-19 vaccination. Now, thrombocytopenia appears missing, needs investigation, mortality rate two roughly similar. done - thank flagging that. Quite right - weed weak! theater went probably 40% capacity. comfortable with, that's part dipping toes back society vaccinated trusting science. didnt feel safe going risking prior getting shot. hopefully vaccine making less severe cases too. government isn’t doling passports enter buildings whether I’ve tried weed also can't force US military get vaccinated without full approval. Probably thing situations they'd typically vaccinate, like unaccompanied minors border. Except aren’t limited supply right 10M go get different vaccine. don’t? cause it’s much safer getting Covid 


*ok think analogy beyond broken now* Let’s also forget British public done exceptionally well following lockdown rules almost 4 months now. Yes people run pubs Primark like zombies moment reopened people shown exceptional restraint far. 

Nothing short amazing moment. Trump managed presidential one year think would helped ballot candidates probably kept senate republicans. Millions pairs single use gloves hand sanitizer bottles later. think estimating number people view going back normal lightswitch.

I know me, minus masking public stores etc little while, I'm going right back normal. Thanks, looking forward second dose easier. media organizations clickbaiting, sure. Many others reporting scientists tell them. It’s already paid reason to. far speed limit analogy, remember back used people arguing wearing seat belt bad crash want thrown car rather burn fiery death. guess also thought cars explode impact like movies.

People change much. They'll believe lot crazy shit reduce cognitive dissonance avoid anxiety. Part reason car manufacturers regulated providing decent seatbelts enough consumer pressure. they're head state. want leader dying perfectly avoidable virus. Congratulations. Unfortunately due way raised, cant ignorant like you. Also, im educated matter know vaccine went proper steps get EUA risk, also people come contact with. worried vaccine covid, well says everything need know. Luckily way thinking minority obvious reasons. fear overblown? Probably. 

But concern variance efficacy vaccine variants infecting population. Pfizer Moderna seems effective area that’s experts keeping eye things. May something Covid. already see advertisement. 3 week stay minimum. Get one shot way one way out. No, understand. 

They run trials until, say, 300 people infected stop compare control group vaccinated group. 

If lot cases trials conducted, getting 300 people take less time. change ratio data. Sadly kids can’t get vaccinated yet good, thanks info Without eu canada would shambles. know true friends are. certainly wont forget Plus lot non European countries getting vaccines europe us production isnt exported. Canada got AZ vaccines usa usa them, even fda approved going expire. canada got exchange vaccines later. Canada literally pay back vaccines...

Canada giving second dose right away anymore. enough vaccines two delaying second dose quite long time. Yeah, head intensive care units netherlands furious stopping wit AZ trombose experts also say understand government acts way does. 
We almsot 800 people covid IC 400 normal ones, like max capacity due personnel shortage (not machine shortage). 
And like months around 700-800. Nurses exhausted many thinking ablut quiting. 
I would get AZ tomorrow, allowed. laying somewhere unused 60. like take, think day coming relatively soon, reasonable people collectively relax. People throw around May/June timeframe seems right. happened AZ Gates foundation?  Lol can’t tell serious typical la redditor sarcasm, way seen whole social media/covid fanatics change entire lives demand everyone else made lot cynical ever before. 
If elder person unluckily health conditions- maybe, don’t. 
And even then. wouldn’t “pandemic” everyone could mask survive lol. It’s pandemic cause it’s gonna kill people lot less educated population thinks J&amp;J traditional style vaccine. Plenty older white males lean right politically willing take j&amp;j, mrna ones due conspiracy theories matter people say, listen scientists. practice stuff everyday disease herd immunity, like everyone gets Polio unvaccinated. Yeah way they've they'll call store intercom asking anyone wants one. unless store time, getting it. people realize could get one going state guidelines. throw ask insurance card makes people think free. Oh people pushing that, ignored. real argument. surpressed immune system got first Astra vaccine Australian government advises get 50. 

If option get vaccinated, I'd get vaccinated 50 times over. I've autoimmune reaction drugs that's 2 per million.

You might survive covid ever lasting effects still screw life. Herd immunity mean stops existing. means large chains infection. binary hit herd immunity virus disappears. still pockets it.

In places people vaccinate high levels, odds part cohort needed achieve herd immunity pretty high. Assuming estimates 70-80% right, odds either infection group vaccination group.

This especially true given we're told we'll need boosters annually. Take off, eh!!! 😁 Agreed. There's also going overreaction first severe case people realize ""100% effective preventing severe cases"" actually implied ""in trial"" it. wish messaging little nuanced, guess many people would get confused turn simpler messaging. booster shot extend current immunity fight new virus variants? safe. CDC's guidelines vaccinated households unvaccinated people one household indoors them, maskless. literally trolley problem come life. answer fucking switch tracks. thank you. agree, love ramen might outlier. I'm first shot AZ right now. Hope last post. feel fine, get second month. ""we know risks, let's extrapolate anyway, hooray!"" means 5% vaccinated population get COVID. 1,000 1,000,000 people get COVID without vaccinations, vaccinate entire population 1,000,000, 50 still get it. would safe per CDC guidelines. meeting maskless one party unvaccinated okay long everyone else vaccinated. MI's case counts best flat, unfortunately. still going strong here. lot worst counties flattened high rate, others moderate rate seeing increases. See making sound like good thing Obnoxious formatting paragraph separation issue people coming early. mine yesterday took longer showing appointment barcode (3 times, scanned twice) driving cones setup. 15-30 min wait smooth, everyone nice verbose instructions. Lucky COVID-19 isn’t lab...otherwise would lethal &amp; transmissible /s 🤯 Nah, voices opinions count too.   That’s efficacy works supposed lock untill everyone decides get vaccinated? point we'll accept risks. Unless want round antivaxers put shot force, amount covid exist. Mutations happen, boosters had. 

Eat well, drink water, excercise, get vax hope best. *safety* issue. *permission* is. Tell people get together barbecue masks someone asks mask they're allowed tell go, given incentive.  efficacy means half country vaccinated 100,000 daily cases, 10,000 would vaccinated people.

10,000 people part get seriously sick go hospital. Also, areas higher vaccination rates almost certainly less cases practice less 10,000. see Israel. Well, that's 95% efficacy means.

95% efficacy means 95% people would gotten virus without vaccine get it.  Look covid vaccine tracker, select NH. 56% population received least one dose sure leave shoes home, too. say people either choose attempt evade covid end time, possible long enough immunity chances become low enough able get neither fine? dunno. think masks cool. Makes feel like Blue Bandit.    vaccine rollout, think Israel's handling coronavirus exactly considered success. one highest infection rates world last autumn (albeit low morbidity rate) third lockdown winter widespread flouting rules.

I think we've done better lot countries terms distancing getting businesses adapt spaces situation, time vaccines rolled lot population complacent/had given rules. odds list all, categories. vastly different probabilities outcome. Also similar is, many people affected. Back beginning UK everyone saying many infected many dead. That’s wasn’t well established yet. 

What happens AZ people go booster 5 months line immune systems responds something. What’s risk death covid, what’s risk severe disease, what’s risk bloods clots? small risk anyone response AZ 5800 66 *million* got infected. That's slightly 0.01%. 5800, 74 died, 1%. chances dying vaccinated 0.0001%. statistics insane. vaccines nothing short miracles get damn logistical challenges way governments could take heads asses (see: Europe), pandemic completely over. Rather live life. Haven’t thought covid 8 months. 
I’m also risk age group - would worried finished clinical trial vaccine covid flu happen women. seems happen women, even certain, women taken AZ vaccine far. bad news there's going vocal minority demands masking social distancing perpetually now. sure go numbers. I'm showing 26.7% NH vaccinated. Seems little trigger happy me. Yes, basically. either stay vaccinated eventually odds get COVID point. 

The word ""endemic"" spoken reason. going away. messaging see regarding vaccine place. completed failed vaccine messaging it’s fueling anti vax people making return normal much harder.  Ship Canada Latin America. Eight times number small would rounded 0. Fear-mongerimg know is. get flu shot years, flu generally get reported much. need Covid boosters, hopefully level interest years. feel it’s inevitability either get Covid vaccine? Like one other? wonder age 4 dead people... understand argument, where's data poor mask usage increases risk catching COVID? 

Yeah, guy masked face left nose dangling wind jackass. covering mouth give greater protection nothing all? guy fiddles mask makes sense might creating another vector, guy touching face materially increasing risk COVID, especially know spread probably driven floating droplets poor ventilation? wouldn’t you? It’s free, it’s accessible, may lead sore arm days feeling sick vs. potentially far longer serious case contract COVID.

Plus, people get vaccinated quickly possible, faster area position lift restitutions. Every person vaccinated closer herd immunity wouldn’t part contribute want restrictions eased ASAP? Holy shit, expecting low thats *strikingly* low. vaccine serious stuff. would say would average daily case count pandemic ends? think US would matter was. state legislator jumping line would roasted. Senator Congressman would probably get treatment. President he'd get shit party that's politics work days think us common folks would mind. guy finger nuclear trigger. probably healthy keep him. basically like second flu shot every year? I'm going start walking every store without shirt say I'm discriminated I'm asked leave. got second dose yesterday far worst vaccine side effects I’ve ever had. definitely feels like flu. Fever, chills, body aches over... pro-vaccine, right now, I’d lying said I’m hesitant getting booster. suppose may change mind I’m feeling like this? Like get hangover swear you’re never touching alcohol again. done already? people day? sitting around social media like people office?  Smells corruption, though. Rules apply everyone. someone power uses power jump line, they're misusing office personal gain. Reddit big boner Oxford/Astrazeneca vaccine. still development would constantly see pictures random Oxford scientist saying ""this person working save humanity"" never anything vaccines. half entire population received least one dose. Also, importantly, 100% people new hampshire eligible able get appointment get vaccinated. it’s protect health. Amen Brother/sister. like positive attitude, its.very much needed many spiralling fear despair. b-but mah fReEdUmB! also risk spreading perpetuating disease within community. sooner reduce case numbers, faster get back normal. love baffles people, like heard vaccine 100% effective something. people understand means something 95% effective? 5% vaccinated people still get Covid, statistically. people stupid. justify injecting vaccine ""gives chance"" blood clot, also take chances getting covid. He's right though. Haha true. Ok vaccinated keep masks best way convince people get vaccine, especially younger ones. Aggravated Costco, local store showed starting vaccinate earlier week J&amp;J shot canceled. Site say Phizer Moderna ""Covid Dose 1"".

Arrived bit ago get vaccine said they'd canceled ever J&amp;J. explanation let folks sign J&amp;J canceled J&amp;K pulled every distribution sign up.

Be safe percent NH population vaccinated? ""No evidence masks effective.""

Sometimes find it’s chilly, pulled pass people forgot it, hands busy texting picking dog poop haven’t chance pull yet, it’s easier remember put leave house, take return. I'm Northern part state confirm desire get vaccine really high. neighborhood FB group continually shares stories sites Southwestern VA cities VA/NC border lowkey walk clinics lack demand people offering carpools stuff sites get vaccinated. know VA pharmacies stricter states leftover doses here, heard anyone able get walk extra dose way I've heard states. I'm glad got weeks ago! ""Discrimination"" legal, unless protected category race, gender, etc. times good thing, I'm freely able discriminate thieves, murderers, socially problematic people. 

""Economic discrimination"" soft pressure vaccine hesitant inevitable, people following American rights pursue self-interest.  

Colleges universities want outbreak shutting campus, require vaccinations. Businesses want scare customers risk outbreak employees, require vaccinations. None illegal immoral. Plus, various groups following self-interest, society whole benefits. what? 
You recover keep living lol I’m curious - mean 70% population would get booster shot year, live normal life without lockdowns such? people quite mild. need shot get badly reasonably likely get badly. wondering, bidens first 100 days ends april 30th, means got 14 days administer 22 million doses. unless asteroid hits montana, bidens goal sure thing tell moron anti-vaxx do. can’t wait around year worried “others”. Especially others 65 years old lives lives already without shutting life 1+ years. 
Harsh truth According Bloomberg, 115 million doses exported EU's export control regime. Add exports Covax, Israel dozen countries subject controls, least 140 million doses exported EU far. Here's hot take: vaccine Covid result potential death young healthy people. 0. required get though, there's lot talk congress making required. people terrible side effects, excuse wanting put every year mandatory. Sure better lockdown world again, mean can't complain it. 








Also gotta realize people terrified getting shots. yea, may happy finding get every year now. still get it, happy Deaths follow infections usually taking least 2-3 weeks. lagging indicator. amount young people get infected vrs older people. Hospital stays deaths lower time. 80 hours, mean 8h? 80h 2 40h work weeks. side effects lasting anywhere near long  kinda similar pandemic early stages, patients put ventilators helping?  Israel rolled vaccine bars locations young people hung out. positive peer pressure, plus ease makes great idea. like vaccine drives campuses. Oh well. die point 
Wouldn’t “pandemic” weren’t killin people majority healthy fit people know never get flu shot. Whats point? even remotely effective Except developing countries without changes protocols maintaining them. sure expect that. (Guatemala) get freezer trucks sure ice cream/food. Ultra freeze literally exist here. rural areas barely find reasonable sized freezers storage, let alone power outages every week two would ruin batches. need incentivize people, that’s all. Severely limit ability travel participate things without proof vaccination. They’ll come around. shoes, shirt, vaccine? entrance. happens women. don’t keep giving vaccine men? state opened 18+ friends went vaccination site asked extra, got stab spot. there, probably edited article published, heres quote: “A likely scenario likely need third dose, somewhere six 12 months there, annual revaccination, needs confirmed. again, variants play key role,” told CNBC’s Bertha Coombs event CVS Health."" Florida, New York, Michigan seeing lower case numbers week ago. Keep eye things next week so. New York already looks like they’re trending Add NJ-adjacent PA tri-state region think right. I'm certain I'll wearing mask everywhere go least time next year. agree. think lot people would vaccinated could targeted better. gave got cold feet, others actually caught covid.

My state begging them, even cases ticked up. Imagine outcry equal though. inside - like Russian doll pretty useless considering covid rates transmission extremely low outdoor setting Yes metals speak actually dangerous. sound scary people easily misled. ingredients normal vaccines safe too.

Waiting human trials finish 
But prob either way

Not high risk group think “Didn’t guys tell safe months ago? I’ll never believe again.” Sad? yeah, tone essentially: ""rich western"" states fault? sure understand trying say. US government paid doses, FAR worse India, so, government say: ""no wait, go India"" no.....and shouldn't, time charity, people need taken care first, give doses away love posts. nice something cheer for. predict virus cases trend down. guess May 1 start declining 2 weeks states available everyone eligible. Plus, warm weather. number also include exports countries Israel EU's list export controls. 

Thus, real number likely much higher. How’s aboot send Canada please, m’kay thanks much, eh 🇨🇦 That's good reason avoid situations could contract contagious respiratory infection. wanna go visit friend girlfriend (who fully vaccinated) apartment hang us maskless. partially vaccinated.

I live home dad brother partially vaccinated well, along couple renters whose vaccination status risk factors unknown. dad falls couple increased risk factor groups (age, hypertension). Can’t u still get transmit vaccine? urgent care told screw fine. Unless another underlying health condition, rest bed, drink fluids, take Tylenol.

I care saving lives. Well shit. I'm scared. got mild first dose Moderna. joined support group people got (before yall say I'm crazy antivaxxer, I'm not, I'm extremely pro vaccines, even ENT gp pharmacist gave shot agreed side effect getting reports sudden others, also rare reported side effect vaccines, overall covid much likely give T). I'm getting 2nd dose tomorrow consensus doctors seems caused inflammation. thought meant temporary reading Idk. I’m NY stores still mask mandates august low car counts, I’m going places. Whoever doesn’t get business. 102.2 actually quite bit 103, wouldn’t worry even 103. reason Google says concern severe infection, know fever. 

He’ll fine. Drink fluids, take Tylenol. -iq  barely think anyone 65?
Can please fat forward already understand possible test people. looked severe cases. 

Look previous page, all-available efficacy population, ten participants severe COVID-19 disease Dose 1 That's cult even cult-like behavior. That's ignorance. Searching 2 minutes Google show need certain quality mask effective. people especially big pieces shit trying play along get flack wearing mask, yet still risk everyone around them. Selfish cowards every sense words. Unlikely. flu get whatever best shot year (or likely best shot).

I imagine similar COVID vaccines. There's also research going determine getting shot different types vaccines actually gives *better* protection. vaccine efficacy rate 90% poor protecting me? United States (and company) supposed self sabotage give vaccines everyone else protecting citizens? It’s like airplane. You’re supposed put mask emergency event helping others- even children. world do... need three words one do: Morons remain hesitant.... Doesn’t help go get try fight pharmacy benefits card. Told don’t one. It’s included work healthcare. tried give shit finally asked “If vaccine free need see insurance card????” stopped conversation immediately took back. virus still highly prevalent society, would prefer play immunogenic version Russian Roulette forced to. Thanks, mentioned another comment, quote article posted. entire article literally paragraph. Usually 5-10 thousand miles depending ..which much thousand. Also EVs thing get really do. studies show live healthy active 98% survival rate preach vaccines sus. Tomorrow 7 days post 2nd dose Pfizer. Going take family outdoor eating weekend think. all. Imagine you’re tepid vaccine taker months CDC telling vaccines safe they’ve done huge safety trials tens thousands people totally confident vaccines safe. Three months later, CDC says “well actually, need take pause we’re sure” millions already vaccinated. people, feels like betrayal. It’s easy us educated people say “yeah it’s one million chance” “yeah worst vaccine you”, people know nothing vaccines, they’re losing trust CDC months ago told everything safe. quote added article long posted comment, exactly point. fucking dumb. isnt even comparison terms efficacy. Im curious, much space doses by?  Here's video says quote article: get antibody test? That's weeks months ago. 

Do mean antigen test? Nice try flipping script you’ve buried. fact article you’re purposely obtuse. 

You also seem think know lot we’re someone doesn’t live here.  mean, many Western countries same... People feel cloth mask face major inconvenience truly cannot comprehend. political games, Germany's head state took AZ. unbiased studies show silly games involved. Superfast turnaround study. even know clotting issues weeks ago, right? concerning study like shoved door right issues come up.

""Study finds"" great metric measuring real-world outcomes.  gone ""we eliminate it"" ""countries (temporarily) eliminated stay isolated long good financial position"". Okay. mean, stay isolated want to. likely won't, they're balancing financial considerations (I imagine people Australia would like see foreign families again, example), could choose to. global eradication? 

And rude point hysterical point view, although sorry took way. Maine 30% fully vaccinated far till gets mass produced. month, quater year? think calling people disease-ridden wanting hike extremely anti-science long completely honest get clots; ""you took one team, thanks!""

like long dont sugar coat logic wind dying: yes, know die, worth it. 

im totally cool thats message send, ill first line. society gonna tuck tail try hide truth reality it, well dont motivation help get shot. people saying, “it’s early, give another month two”, saying thing 2 months.

Fully agree. That's never liked proposition. individuals say ""it's early, let's wait another month remove mask mandates/restrictions"" saying ""Let's remove restrictions month!"", rather saying ""Let's wait month, see situation re-evaluate then"". fair long say metrics removing mask mandates/restrictions are. would like concrete realistic metrics, something vague like ""low spread"". 

So say ""It's early end restrictions"", say metrics mind, healthy debate metrics. Hmmm work x institution institution beaten lately vaccine.

My reputation tied institution.

I’m saying malice dismiss bias would ridiculous. totally feel , fortunate get Pfizer back December job, year treating Covid patients , wearing N95's everywhere felt like massive victory. People seem never consider morbidity mortality. Look polio people kill. Thankfully family qualified vaccination feb got moderna Pfizer. mRNA vaccines proven nothing safe EXTREMLY effective. really, no. far know. Also, live France, quite high level mask compliance here. Kids like wearing mask, that's really , least mine. Also, kindergarten kids wear masks France, can't issue. Jesus, dude, think. Social distancing makes 100% capacity impossible. Therefore 100% capacity restriction lifted application real world. Silly rules like allow law enforcement arbitrarily decide harrass business. 


No cars go 40 analogy. Every car limited 40, like every place limited social distancing, allow 100% capacity. 


You silly. place 100% capacity, therefore restriction 100% capacity. Period. Um no, they're talking specific rare type clots. rate type clots extremely high Covid, 8 times higher risk vaccination.

Of course, Covid also cause types clots, strokes, heart attacks, respiratory failure, organ damage, neurological damage killed millions people worldwide babies old people. mention social economic damage pandemic mental health issues. EU probably like 5. vaccine roll going real bad. damned damned don’t situation. Confidence going fall whether it’s paused essentially ignored. follow procedures pause notify everyone issue investigated. Also, weird compare blood clots blood clots. really compare organ damage COVID vs AZ. deaths. 

If vaccine 1/8 dangerous, know risk (what chances get COVID safer vaccine available? Might less 1/8).

But way less dangerous I'm sure are, laws written enforced money power. Florida also right work state fired anything make excuse. Covid started group ICU nurses complaining lack PPE CDC time said airborne, need negative pressure rooms N95/duckbill/CAPR masks. got fired. 

Needless say, wife finishes DNP, getting fuck Florida. calculate “8x’s likely” numbers including estimated asymptomatic cases symptomatic, positive tested COVID cases? amazon.com e-commerce website allowed posts comments.

*I bot, action performed automatically.

People really weird things ingrate beliefs. Especially beliefs really based anything feelings. seems like one best safest vaccines

Not 2nd 3rd world countries account much larger percentage world's population can't afford higher price higher cost storage. Agree maybe decision like input someone expertise might beneficial. completely fabricated example say 10 million people don’t take vaccine pause translate net change loss lives? don’t know answer it’s reasonable thing expect evaluate evaluate accurately really would need input behavioral scientist. That’s point, right wrong call decisions don’t exist vacuum. feel way. Moderna’s phase 3 clinical trial last summer it’s super cool think one first people world receive mRNA vaccine. vaccines end effective HIV cancer I’m getting NCT04470427 tattoo. Lower Saxony, typically, lagging behind. 
Looking stats  
  
Bremen completed vaccination 6.6% gen-pop. That's going 40% 60+ 
1st shot 20.9% - maybe? bout time would say likely statement commenter made, actually achieve herd immunity, let alone fact herd immunity way means virus eradicated. PR nightmare ""the government knew J&amp;J vaccine could cause blood clots nothing"" can't tell damaging peoples perception vaccine safety. Maybe paused women I'm sure thats much better. wait spits dummy due political gains kills citizens again. AstraZeneca pay subreddit defend everything?? vaccines controversial stories ffs  Good job UK. curious ratio people London antibody now.   believe Pfizer Moderna ran studied British, SA Brazilian variant although reduction neutralizing antibodies, still enough clinical efficacy. I'll try find papers read that. isn't. talking Israel. use Pfizer exclusively - need get examples straight.

The ones need lot work.. time perfected.. say. 

Countries quarantine borders long remains cost effective. cost effective current, considering alternative.

And starting become rude... can't speak respect think stop. Perfect answer.

And adding this. Covid comes chaos nature. Astrazeneca freely given vaccine gouvernement.

The government killing citizens.
Corona killing random people.
Its huge difference even 1 1000.000 scale.

All eyes fixed vaccines. enough anti vaxing going on. Governments make sure citizens still believe them. big difference using ""just fun"" e.g. easier sex, therapy medical issues like migraine, agree.

Even see pill primary medical instrument migraine stuff (and sorry, absolutely used cases), still discrepancy med cure single person med vaccine helps end pandemic.

So right, Iam trying say, too. AZ Johnson get stopped banned again, pill highly popular doctors give smarties, although many known proven riscs. peer reviewed. need know. CDC 100% certain yesterday. sounds like slapped together paper uneven data sets make AZ look better Throughout world looking like BioNTech whole thing figured much better everyone else. government repeatedly said Pfizer shipment arrives time, one batch, every single week. MHRA [already investigated found male female. skewing cases towards women due women received AZ vaccine. data adjusted account that, clotting risks men women.

You also careful taking low dose aspirin unless advised doctor. Generally recommended seen beneficial 65 potential side effects outweigh benefits then. course, personal circumstances may change that. Mariana Islands : increase 0 yesterday 1 today (increase 1)

Guys think go back full lockdown, Northern Mariana Islands saw infinite percent increase cases. Mild inconvenience still inconvenience, annoy people varying levels. applying feelings world everyone different, different tolerances, can’t logically. tested positive antibodies monday negative PCR wednesday, still tell wait till 19th take another PCR test. Im sure it, right Im experiencing lot nausea. common symptom? even symptom, official CDC symptom list heard elsewhere was. think issue combination blood clots low platelets, leading standard first line treatment clots (blood thinners) actually leading serious injury death. 

If 'normal' clots, they'd issue guidance keep eye follow standard treatment procedure patients get - case, standard treatment dangerous doctors need know, patient presents clotting, whether they've vaccinated J&amp;J AZ recently. Donate? Buyers already lining up.  think great point. Many people making seem vaccine absolutely risk, risks vaccine greatly outweigh risks COVID. However, risk profiles vary person person. would question whether ""worth it"" inject young, healthy people vaccine could potentially harm them. hand, 70+ comorbidities, getting vaccine makes sense.

A friend told everyone get vaccine, *even may harm them*, ""benefit society"". also tricky ethical question, I'm sure stand. everything black&amp;white people make seem. Go go go New Zealand. reason Jacinda loved lot. many countries leaders actually wait turn (probably PR). Sweden ministers one, EU-minister vaccinated 73. king queen also vaccinated also 70s. PhD literally Doctor philosophy. mean studied philosophy, historical name give degree Increased clotting well described COVID patients. Problem virtually hospitalized COVID patients receive heparin, CVT clots develop due heparin induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). However, seem much likely develop HIT non-COVID patients receiving heparin. small percentage develop HIT without heparin exposure. I’m really interested see data says. Explain 6 authors direct conflict interest, simply another group people another part university designed vaccine. PhD PhD pharmaceutical engineering.

That probably makes qualified average MD talk this... choice take AZ vaccine want wait Pfizer vaccine, gambling contract Covid time, carries much higher risk killing causing long lasting health problems. don’t like either. 

It’s erased original series replaced with... whatever is. 

It’s rude. People took vaccine study known long time ago, healthy people getting sick dying Great add six months whatever time line give. Remember, folks, it’s two weeks nice Christmas. age bracket's Germany vaccinating now? fully vaccinated COVID vaccines. people do. never heard viral load, operating since February 2020 presumption single particle virus harmful. viral load required, happens smaller load particles enter lungs? sit dormant lungs, become expelled coughing exhaling? body's immune system attack them? Thanks comment. can’t believe (or maybe can) media public health betters haven’t framed way. J&amp;j tested covid variants thing, vaccines tested before. reading they’re likely equally effective.  talking every study literally says mRNA vaccines 96% immunity 14 days. I’m going orgies strangers damn sure I’ll back restaurants, hanging friends going gym again. would wait one two superior ones unless job required person work. Yeah I've specifically told doctor want routine, annual physical. Apparently said magic words coded visit differently got billed $200. take height, weight, blood pressure.

HELTH. blood clots, covid also causes death ways, well causes debilitating disease permanent damage much much higher rate.

I'm pulling numbers ass remember exact ones... covid cause ER-level health issues 5% people? That's 50K/million.

Juuuuust bit higher handful blood clots per million. otherwise pretend silly faster light star ship that's less sophisticated 2021 Prius. I'd much rather bit canon discontinuity show disappear ass trying explain teleportation LCD screens! sounds like way dropping without saying we're dropping it.

This seems like considerate sane thing do. Even low-population EU countries manage without it, others EU hit harder need help get, 1 country openly declaring want nothing X vaccine raises awkward questions continuing use it. Quietly suspending indefinitely avoids that, done. shame Denmark equally considerate others. science every negative impact lockdowns had. freaking children even go school. Less 0.25% people died, yet least 70 million children education disrupted year. laugh, funny. lived this, science reality life say lockdowns worse. personal experience? way responded makes seem like person can't feel lile lockdowns worse. can. feel like suffer worse, suffer worse. measured much money threw around. Poor people suffered ways none understand callously give fuck about. lockdowns unquestionably worse COVID. even disagree, think right fundamentally change life? don't. lockdowns worse things happen humanity last 100 years. worse war, self inflicted. need end now. J&amp;J vaccine getting AZ treatment part plan? backlog old saying medicine, ""If Zero Side Effects, Probably Doesn’t Work"". equivalent US donating 51,5 million doses, assuming means 800k single doses, even otherwise really are! awesome hope keep it.  


You can't ignore fact far many people actively behaving ways fucking things up, though. happening Canada, see happening far many countries.  


Now time stop trying, yes? fair, reason driving mile warped adage ""You likely get accident 10 miles home.""

Duh, driving.  One major talking points vaccines reduce severity cases top reducing likelihood infection. suggesting true, entirely possible many asymptomatic/non-tested cases would lower fatality rate. again, would suggest overall efficacy lower reducing cases, possibly suggest transmission still probable many vaccinated people.

Too early draw conclusions, also early say something worrying. terms safety efficacy, seem true. Honestly I've saying same. ingredients mRNA shots safest we've ever used. preservatives, metals, food grade lipids, salts, sugar mRNA instruction. heard simple ingredients, funny sounding chemical names lamens may understand super excited get either mRNA shot. got Moderna. Sunday 100% fully vaccinated, 6 weeks total first shot. I'd meant never getting covid. Cause f getting covid. want take chances. already virus 2019 destroyed right ear. die hospitalized. take super offense people say 1% death rate. Try living 10khz sound wave ear 24/7. fun. Oh, gotcha. think previous comments saying time mandatory getting shot. mandatory get it. Maybe I'm confused, knows?

And yeah, misunderstood bank B stuff. That's bullshit. kind laws preventing that??? Maybe, maybe not. article: anecdotes doctors suggests variant spreads faster, infectious, infect entire families, less virulent doesn’t cause dramatically hospitalisations.

less virulent actually good thing, elsewhere article say lot cases asymptomatic. fitness advantage infectiousness plus diminution severity, \*could\* translate good thing. But, article says place, enough data know one way other, many claims(higher transmissibility, reason surge, less virulence, higher hospitalizations, etc). MIL FIL jabs. 
  
That 4 round trips 70 kms big queues, since get appointment together. wife accompanied them.

My FIL, 92, quite upset sight many frail older people struggling physically get this. I'm surprised many make it. cdc clear lack kind event moderna Pfizer. quick finger J J. US giving mrnas hundreds million. sure turn true. 

Just like preprint saying Pfizer want effective SA variant. Also alarmist ""studies"" British variant lethal etc UK variant already confirmed effect vaccine effectiveness one probably won’t issue. 

The SA variant Brazil variant could though personally don’t see Biden lifting travel restrictions countries anytime soon. link provide additional context search for? 0.03% kids is, like, 20,000 kids? That's line? Ok. plan. 

Vaccines perpetuity diseases exactly for, know, everything else. already multiple vaccines require cold temperatures (J&amp;J AZ) others testing normal temperatures. countries can't afford it, they'll let rip like year now.

Quarantine countries ""can"" even make sense - long quarantining? Forever? Otherwise quarantine next 5 years *still* facing variants point. Get help hysteria. real issue people understand statistics. Take worst case scenario, like 1 6 million chance die covid vaccine. There's also around 1 100 million chance die per mile driven. means covid vaccine chance killing driving 15 miles. Exactly, people used use skittle analogy lockdowns save risk group death rate around 1%:

""If given 100 skittles one poisonous, would still eat skittles?""

This analogy works blood clot risk vaccines. Yet, reason people used lockdowns instead call crazy say rather AZ vaccine say things like OP article.

I get it. let choose put body. develop nearly medical technology number life saving MRI machines available US far outweighs Canada 4x. Care explain one? ""Tinted supplements""

Lmao wish protein shake free PEDs 30yo itaian, hopefully get first shot christmas Somebody got Bells Palsy taking Pfizer vaccine.  vaccine guaranteed perfectly safe.  Especially ones taken billion people.  aware every rare side effect. People want die vaccine, people want understand risk. Spreading vaccine hesitancy 1 million chance side effect crazy dangerous. 1 million chance high justify getting vaccine, fine, don't. spread around internet vaccine dangerous 1 million complication invites criticism people work risk understand numbers like those.  didn’t say it’s form oppression?! 


Why would need masks testing say, high school, 95-100% students staff vaccinated?! 


If risk large ban soda, alcohol, driving, sort fun, stay home, masked socially distant course, indefinitely. Walmart Hodgkins whole week wide open checked Sunday afternoon. frankly shocked signed tomorrow morning, a.k.a. first free time work calendar. miles away. I'm strangely excited. think masks mandated July @ Disney. Universal.  early 20’s got vaxxed America Masks still much thing much Texas PFA shits given. *R. Kelly entered chat* manufacturing logistics, thank Pfizer that. thats like going buy extinguisher house already half burning want point “re-open” isn’t binary statement. I’m saying Fauci et. al., recommending full 100% return normal, slow opening consistent vaccination rates community. 

The messaging coming Fauci is, “fully vaccinated? Continue stay home nothing! It’s still safe go restaurant. *maybe* see another couple back yard”. Excuse me, what? 

I’m suggesting let restaurant open 100% maskless capacity let 100 unvaccinated 20 year olds spill drinks other. I’m saying slowly start open. Again, isn’t nothing solution. that's probably part get back still hurts breathe then. Used live Danville. Bout backwards place get raised southwestern Virginia 🤣 mean people didn’t get antibodies all? (7% Pfizer 13% AZ) 

Good news AZ cell response though! Hopefully Pfizer number went 2nd shot. probably watch football really, look France people would take AZ nowadays. Well clarify, case ***false*** impression pushed skeptics virus merely flu slightly worse flu, sub saying past 13 months ignoring Fauci following recommendations good states. Quite opposite, fact. sub last 13 months said follow data take virus seriously, mask up, social distance go need to. recently changed slightly account vaccine distribution ramped thanks good national leadership. Still, opening state data support complete absence mitigation efforts minority view.

Now point time sub brigaded trying undermine virus mitigation efforts, short lived. want point areas appear confused. helped logistical requirements relaxed normal freezers 2 weeks. many states seeing wave, Michigan extreme outlier right now. I’m conservative. It’s believe, it’s clear way things played imo Hi! definitely scary hearing things news -- think important note 1) serious side effects *literally* one million 2) evidence mRNA vaccines similar side effects either.

The infertility stuff started conspiracy theorist who, simply, lost touch reality. Here's explanation: believes spike protein similar placental protein, therefore, thinks vaccines cause autoimmune attack placenta.

That wrong many levels. First, case, would see phenomenon actual COVID-19 infection, clearly don't. Second, *proteins similar all* -- 11% similarity. context, say two proteins *barely* similar hit like 20-25% similarity. 11% comically low; body attacked anything 11% similarity something immune response against, immune system would wiped us long ago. total nonsense, unfortunately, person spreading misinformation, hence rumors floating around this.

Finally, topic long run side effects -- based underlying biology, really concern. actually similar writeup point FAQ ago recommend read: go lot depth there, briefly summarize: actual vaccine component going destroyed pretty quickly, there's issues, going immune response. sorts autoimmune conditions show quickly -- like 2-6 weeks most, point, comfortably say sort significant vaccine-attributable risk. Immune responses randomly flare years later, even did, immune response now, something brand new going appear months years fact.

Yes, missing point. need access customers EU *nor* US, access customers production need based outside places, come expense EU vaccine manufacturing EU relies ingredients materials externally. 

If EU export bans start, either sidelined pharmaceutical companies (unlikely) manufacturer's set within EU intention producing EU countries outside EU, now. vaccines produce export within EU would need made elsewhere. lot women also hormone replacement therapy early menopause. It’s controversial, also cancer risk, it’s also protective women’s brains bones HRT.

I'm sorry. hope get better soon possible whole point see cases emerge pause on. days still six cases, say ""one million carry on.""  Look forward 2 weeks beyond second Moderna shot. eat out, travel, visit family workout gym like never before!!! Texas alright now, y’all ;) way people disregarding danger implying people potentially let die greater good really outrageous.

At height pandemic lot people UK saying go back office/public/businesses save economy, vaccine. like, even peak ""give life help vs pandemic"" don’t think we’ll ever get 85%, there’s many skeptical people there. Hopefully eventually take account previously recovered cases. 69% would nice though. one looking excuse lockdown. advisor stating fact new variant spreads evades vaccine enough significantly reduce efficacy severe illness we'll reimpose restrictions. unlikely, possibility, must table option. Indeed I'm sure getting numbers from, ~0.15% USA population already died covid-19. Given 1/4 1/3 population likely infected, guess actual chances dying closer 0.5%. That's roughly 3 orders magnitude greater 0.0003% chance indicated. Schools gonna kids vaccinated probably (maybe im wrong idk), (as sounds like are) take indication society large. Everything else likely completely open without masks point except schools airports J&amp;J fucked, already seen inferior vaccine, hold 1 death 7 million people, fucking great job FDA CDC ACIP. hope pillows never cold again.  Heck Yeah! Finally got first shot moderna! purely political decision, signal world dangerous one. Dr. Supriya Sharma Canada today spoke people generally bad evaluating risks potential risk astronomically low, would irrational/illogical take vaccines believe risky (all chewing pills way riskier). Sure know genetically predisposed blot clots, still think it’s worth risk? Mexico ""straight lied"" lot deaths go unreported Europe contracts far doses received far. could stop every export, pay doses still well within contracts manufacturers. every manufacturer would rather take money deliver doses Europe sit warehouses. Stealing would Europe seized shipments vaccines haven’t contracted for, also didn’t pay them. offset experience, everyone know fully vaxxed least 1 shot. Wow free. 

It either covered insurance government covering cost borrowed money.  may pay time service assure vaccine maker/distributor/administrator getting money product and/or services.

I saying way free word would use describe vaccine. would blame private company unless Indian government deal supply vaccines rate &amp; fulfilling promise So? He’ll come back 3 months later. ware second shot AZ given 12 weeks after? Strange stories telling here. Canada's issue quantity doses, logistics. We're pretty close dipping 75% utilization rate nationwide, that's largely due Ontario dropping ball sending doses vaccination sites.

Something like 10,000+ appointments canceled next week, we've got 1.5 million doses sitting freezers Ontario &amp; Alberta waiting. Meeting 7-10 days re-review...

Yeah guys rush all! Heaven forbid order pizzas stay late day two 🤦‍♂️ keeping vaccination Europe, reason mainly J&amp;J/AZ always talked about? Moderna Pfizer? US point literally anyone make appointment get vaccine yet Europe still struggling get going properly.  digging around found I'm vaccinated, honestly, like wearing mask. bother I'll continue wear work long they'll let me, since work germy place get sick every winter *and* department works kids. vaccination rates going up, really care one way vaccinated people wear theirs, mine makes feel safer. Plus, J&amp;J understanding I'm likely catch mild case people two-shot vaccines are. guess want PR nightmare AZ gone instead skip straight end vaccine used particular groups. mean fully vaccinated? 21.023% received atleast first dosage thats UK article talking would recommend it? also pessimistic increasing vaccination numbers, think would wise temporarily stop booking middle seats. believe this. I’ve helping Latino community get vaccines parents friends asked much gonna cost set appointment. explained free shocked. Particularly said phase 3 trials conducted different ways necessarily figures directly compared many people do.

For citations see this: world UK data Pfizer AZ compared conditions see similar. yea typo sorry Well yeah. tricking body thinking pregnant. expect? really true? source that?

Verbs good. Anecdotal evidence weird like could see arguement versions vaccine take. opportunity take J&amp;J vaccine month ago, decided wait Moderna Pfizer available. still locking extent SW Illinois ability wait one comfortable with. Correct. That's Brostrøm said. Dont quite understand would save one person hospitalization, though. Beware fatally experimental, DNA altering gene therapy. Mwahahahaha!!!! California already vaccinating 16+, 16-18 get Pfizer. Yes, young healthy life absolutely worth saving old sick one. hospitals Italy full respirators, prioritized young healthy too. absolutely sacrifice young healthy save sick old. course sound nice, comparing nazism unbelievably wrong.

Well, we're actually making jokes anymore, sad. think even Wuhan almost nobody heard then-unnamed disease January 2020. refuted unfounded claim link evidence, didn’t seem sink in, hoped CorgiOrBread would understand anecdote better. There'll surely film 5 10 years line covid fatique gone. don’t even know you’re talking last point. 

By sub meant sub. articles sub, I’m referencing Canadian epidemiologists Isaac Bogoch Raywat Deonandan said CBC interview August 2020 vaccine rollout would mean slow return normal rolled vaccine age down. unless you’re referring two “lockdown skeptics”, really don’t get point you’re making. Good. Let's keep em America American population reaches herd immunity watch things? soon. Yes, exactly, maybe said, live die choices. thinking it. long fly Maldives i'd definitely would take surf trek get 2nd shot! would rather let people die ask Russia vaccine doesn’t make entirely correct, correct narrow sense. ""6 people 10 million vaccinated blood clots, pull vaccine""

6 people group 10 million people probably blood clots anyway. pull group 10 million people statistically least 6 mauled bull hit lightning. ridiculously meaningless statistic. Also that's still way less risk 550k Americans dead covid 12,000 per 10 million entire population. slightly higher 6. Tylenol kills 458 people year, also close 6, one pulling shelves.

Just no. Comin' save muthafuckin' day, yeah! export J&amp;J now, going use them? Yeah that's thought. feel number vaccinated people go up, closer closer population post-vaccinated severely infected people match percentage efficacy rate. US easiest way check vaccine givers vaccine. got mine Rite aid moderna. aware quite vaccines require boosters, right??? Ahh sucks. always follow random things people say see end recommended. shorter interval likely result lower efficacy longer interval, shortest gap Pfizer trial 18 days, current recommendation 21-42 days per nations gone 120 days. incorrect. Think Phase 3 trials. assumed risk (over large) sample groups. force people exposed virus, count people think been. education system failed huge swaths society. wring hands debate swaths, let (and suffer results mis-informed actions) try better future generations. think Olympic Committee told simply wont' happen postponed beyond year. I'm guessing next year already Winter Olympics year played role.  Yeah, like actual fuck?

Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* According CDC presentation given yesterday regarding J&amp;J vaccine, 6 reported clotting cases among **1,402,712 doses** administered affected demographic (women aged 20-50). So, demographic, risk actually lot higher one million. According data, risk clotting *3 times greater* would see general population (for age/gender group). view full CDC presentation slides (From April 14th): 6 cases ones *officially* reported VAERS. likely many others reported.

In view, hard know certain risk-to-benefit ratio is, especially young healthy people. clinical trials continue, better idea risks vs. benefits years now, able see population-wide effects clearly. 😬 Portsmouth here, kind appreciated lack tourists here. solid argument. note, get immunity (very) prolonged period time vaccine.

Wealthy well educated state, lots people working home polite cautious pandemic choice. beyond ridiculous. Thousands day dying. nothing else, ship India countries might struggle getting frozen vaccines rural areas. 

I'd feel safer getting vaccine hopping plane, understand planes safe. Got second Pfizer shot today. clinic offer rapid antibody tests got one getting shot. \~3 weeks first shot I'm already showing IGM IGG antibodies. Two weeks ago (\~1 week shot) neither. used believe governments something, must sound reasoning, I've found mostly bunch people, average IQs, making poorly informed decisions hoping best. mean, pandemic made clear, know will. take aspirin couple days vaccine reduce risk further

From understand, type blood clots doctors/scientists concerned (CVST) *cannot* prevented aspirin unfortunately.  problem argument coronavirus going away. still looking (at least) 20% population antibodies due passing vaccine, unlucky 5%ish develop antibodies vaccine, antibodies fade infection. 

So ""waiting out"" really factor here. exposed eventually given enough time, places like Britain, astrazeneca vaccine available. proof FOXNEWS also information tragedy commons. got 2nd Pfizer dose. thing I’m glad even go back normal wear mask, rather don’t worry every time feel physically. anxiety worse ever last year it’s gonna take time get it. First step seeking coronavirus news. something important enough find somehow. It’s ironic time sick last year due getting vaccine lol. 74 deaths likely old peeps. Specifically selfishness US. 0 vaccine exports like fuck. June 15th, 10% people shot, appointments open weeks nobody interested... still open up; they've volunteered take risk! Oh that’s good. thought reaction meant body wasn’t building strong immunity. Yeah, 8 people get ill drop dead state J&amp;J dab that. meant understanding phrase. People associate described. used adage another example misunderstanding phrase. Well, vaccination choice, people live choices make. I'm vaccinated everyone know vaccinated.

It's early, lot sympathy people like followed rules recently small (like 20% population) group could get vaccine. already felt pretty singled went open like 20% population 80% population eligible. remove mask mandates put people risk even chance anything it, quite shitty.

I lucky could volunteer clinic get mine, lot people opportunity.

I'm ending mask mandates. 6-8 weeks vaccine available general public give everyone chance. end result decades teaching kids science match belief system substitute ""alternative science"" doesn't. randomized. Different populations. Different dosing regimen recommended. may tell something, tell much. comment replied collecting possible outcomes. Assuming useful start later try determine likelihood visualise actual combined risks. Appeals compassion good, relevant here. I’m pretty mask heavy state NJ rarely see people wearing masks outdoors anymore. never bothered unless somehow going super clustered outdoor space. 3 usa eu rest world wait way fought year a1/2 get insurance company guarantee federally mandated procedure thats supposed covered 100% going cost $2500-$3500 it. Employers benefits department help either.

As add bonus mandated 100% covered yearly physical always $150-$200

Is wonder people trust employers insurance companies? randomized study populations different. AZ may advantage, point moot since comparing single doses pointless reason.

Second Moderna shot next Thursday time next year, Mexico building wall us out. hardcore antivaxxers will. still help vaccine hesitant far gone. Thanks! I’ve seen paper posted before, I’ve since seen (though many, said) recent things suggest moderna indeed elicit cd8+. one example: studies response cd8+ (and cd4+) t-cells elicited Pfizer moderna, means moderna-elicited ones study. I’ve also told t-cells often tough measure could help explain early Pfizer found moderna didn’t...they maybe weren’t looking hard using less-than-ideal test both.


I know response makes sound like already knew answer fishing one agrees already think, may true degree, I’m looking additional info “confirm” notions. Like said, seems little info stuff general guy mentioning Pfizer better t-cell response moderna seemed know talking about, couldn’t get concrete response looking moderna info, maybe not.

Going run park different walking busy shopping street, waiting bus, outdoor gym. actual rate people getting Covid post-vaccine non-healthcare/nursing home workers?

There’s many articles op-eds giving mixed messages right it’s hard get solid answer. 

The healthcare workers/first responders obviously still high chance getting post-vaccine since they’re around at-risk people day vaccinated people work industries?  Science doesn’t ability say anything. However, public health officials trusted interpret science society said pause use vaccine. I’ve listened throughout pandemic, stop now? Daring take, agree IHME model, historically pessimistic most, along expect US start see rapid decline cases next two weeks. also risks covid; many ways end crippled dead.

And other, safer, vaccines. true. ""At least"" 6 months mean ""only"" 6 months. I’m shocked i’m downvoted you’re not... areas away national mandate areas broke b17 surge varient travelled 50 states around spring break easter even....


The fact masks went away doesn’t mean it’s working look #s

There places entire last year weren’t required, know there’s plenty people like even sub apparently they’re going away huge overlap anti-maskers anti-vaxxers &amp; cause need continue wear masks planes, public transport, shared spaces like stores stadiums.


There plenty places away mandate multiple states, they’re dangerous policies jumping gun making environment continue allow virus develop variants (bc thats viruses do) could potentially bypass vaccines’ efficacy. 


People wouldnt wear mask made much worse needed be

A lot people won’t get vaccinated, “no longer required” argument didn’t work masks ‘enough’ cannot work vaccines also people don’t want follow actual guidelines scientists organizations &amp; politicians businesses :/ Oh man heard anyone say before, that's insightful. good thing everyone get vaccine, effective rate 100%, viruses never mutate.

That would sure make people refuse vaccines good reason look like jerks. 6 months minimum. know long past yet. Even then, six feet apart everyone, including people - also outdoors, risk transmission low.

If dense crowd happens outdoors, partying beach dancing cheek cheek that's different. comment linking marketwatch.com automatically removed source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  great point.  think look Israel, biggest population highest amount people vaccinated. clearly working, 60%, yet every metric dropping, nearly fully local high school near offering vaccination 16+ students Monday. I'm looking forward hearing many take it.  generally starts bad gets. ends quickly began. Pick free exchange information, ideas opinions, controlled monitored. can't both. Facebook fault morons use news source consumes majority social life. People never really needed wear masks outdoors. Follow science outdoor spread slim nil. 1.9M really small amount idk he'd say pretty small amount Plus countries already pledged donate actual vaccines well, yet necessarily Covax. Portugal, example, promised back February they'd donate final 5% 2021 EU vaccine allotment poor countries CPLP (the community Portuguese speaking countries). that's problem, dont really know what's going happen slower vaccine pace, Israel vaccinated quickly really know happens % vaccinated learn US, UK. CDC source cited article. revised guidelines, said odds picking covid infected surface 1 10000. thought protection 6 months? would love see vaccine research lead universal flu vaccine point reading briefly touched article, sounds like use early symptom onset, rapidly reduces viral loads upper airwaye spread lungs cause severe symptoms. Basically reduces covid like common cold. I’m pretty sure COVID fucked brain harder vaccine ever could please get vaccinated ""outdoor"" transmission per se, masking gathering strangers. ppl &amp; visiting friends, neighbors, hanging lot given Work Home schedules. extended close contact interactions (even outdoors) promote spread. course jogging yoga something family roomies fine unmasked. let's face it, ppl go dog park pet's benefit. chat &amp; meet dog owners! definition word “craven”. experiencing since Pfizer #2. I'm thinking swollen lymph nodes blame. I'm week 3 afterward beginning resolve. residency requirement includes live part time state. deed, mortgage statement, lease agreement utility bill count.

So someone flies week eligible, still visitors money qualify. Next headline ‘Severe symptoms new COVID variant appears indifferent levels physical activity’ That’s get COVID least know fine. Fuck everyone else through, right? also misleading. J&amp;J clinical trial, two people CVST: one vaccine arm (male) one placebo arm (female). people CVST &amp; J&amp;J, actually 7 total cases include male clinical trial: 6 'real world', 1 clinical trial. actually believe recently found 7th case (female) 'real world', probably going find since takes 6-13 days.

In Europe AZ, female male ratio CVST cases around 2 1, mechanism similar J&amp;J, everyone going around parroting ""well cases young women, risk young women, calculate odds young women only"" also misleading. point, simply enough data conclude affecting young women, especially data Europe AZ support that. fact 7 cases US 'real world' female totally chalked random chance point, especially consider one person got clinical trial male. old...

 198,317,040  assumption covid longer risk certain amount time thus 1-10 holds true indefinitely, could also issue deal next 2-3 years. vaccines thus far proven effective variants worries even fact arily major chunk people call ""political drama"". Pathetic people. economists, psychiatrists, kinds experts involved decision making, unfortunately we've delegated people narrow field way heads. economist would say ""hey, we're almost certain covid stops spread, tiny risk spread worth getting far people vaccinated saying burn masks go party 100 strangers nightclub shot."" I've heard anecdotally lot people UK get AZ hindered vax efforts there. antivaxer? sure? obviously missing point comparing risk specific rare blood clots. They're common Covid, still 8 x common Covid vaccine.

You've also decided forget significant risks Covid, including types blood clots, neurological organ damage, respiratory failure, strokes heart attacks vaccination real world data showing preventing hospitalisation deaths.

 could also compare number world wide deaths (millions) Covid number sadly died vaccination. thought bit harder would see comparing likely die Covid vs vaccine terms CVST only. change minds anti-vaxxers.

It might change mind people generally pro-vax, brand new vax disease particularly deadly large swaths population. include risk getting covid dieing and/or blot clots aswell. fair say vaccine far presents least risk compared getting clots vaccine. Lower cases positivity last week, fewer hospitalized today yesterday, also bit fewer shots last week (our three-in-a-row record days doses last week) probably due J&amp;J. 8 times? many? see broken yet. think PhD researchers know there's underlying risk clots regardless whether vaccinated?

I'm impression clots seen different organic origin traced back vaccine I'm ok vaccination end disagree pointless. contracting covid lockdown last year sick last year year since sick. proves masks work normally get sick whatever crud passed around office church community general. plan keep wearing even though I'm vaccinated. people want wear vaccination rates go care. risk increased already low platelets? I’m fence someone answer this. say im moron? remember so. head government, president actually head state. Conveniently ignoring short long term effects covid may have. Republican party isn’t monolithic would work everyone (there still many Republicans saw Trump merely least bad option). 

All said, fantastic point. Putting Trump advocate “his administration’s vaccine” would work significant part conservative base. hope Trump gets involved vaccine promotion coming months. point, people vaccinated makes everyone safer, regardless political affiliation. 

(Note: use term “his administration’s vaccine”, factually true, would good way market vaccine certain areas). always possibility.

Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Nah work like that. make sure insurance use it. insurance problem getting vaccines. much longer going restrict parents coming schools, school events make school fun, eating lunchroom, extracurricular activities, etc. Simply going school getting associated fun activities miserable. close full time restrictions make miserable. Kids need kids 16+ get shot. We're ruining social development we've forgotten reasonable risk is. Breakthroughs expected. vaccines reduce transmission, prevent illnesses, ease others something much less dangerous. 

Hundreds millions people vaccinated. Pfizer Moderna boast 95% efficacy, remaining 5% means millions still susceptible. J&amp;J's case, protection severe illness nearly equivalent, however solid 30% recipients still infected.

As long cases remain mild, I'm worried. Michigan ahead Texas Florida death rate. Michigan fewer reported cases per 100k, also got hit earlier minimal testing place.  It’s ridiculously high lab fees I’m worried about. 

I got bill $1200 Quest fairly routine labs covered. Insurance wouldn’t budge, said copay. Yep, claim variants noticeable effect US J&amp;J study bunk.

The video referring video Vox. Vox generally great source accurate information; sometimes good, wish people took giant grain salt anything put out. honestly pretty frustrating relatively little see talking point emphasized. Maybe sounds callous, every surge go push us closer herd immunity? Hell, say top fifty percent vaccinated - scores people already infected easily carry us eighty/ninety percent goal we're shooting for? fifty percent vaccine uptake really problem? genuine questions, I'm layman talking ass. point think write anyone yells weirdo. even going NY mandate situation.. True story. live GA there's fairly large vaccination center AL within 50 miles live. basically put call last month anybody show get shots ... went. know lots others GA also. what's scary 63% probably 63% tons people state took advantage high vaccine availability there. thing happening towards beginning rollout US (late January, early February). Geez, well, too. Envy world now. Again, great questions! short answer is: been, issues prevented mRNA getting cell immune system degrades it. STAT News great piece topic couple problems solved. First, needed way prevent mRNA getting caught quickly degraded rapidly immune system even chance get cells. independent RNAses described -- I'm talking actual immune response here. Second, needed way efficiently get cells. Third, show combining previous two steps actually effective causing protein production cells gets degraded reasonable timescale cell.

These developments essentially published 2004, 2000, 2010, respectively -- biggest problem first one, preventing immune system attacking mRNA itself. STAT News piece really good job going details accessible way.

So short answer is: we've known mRNA long time, actually harnessing based recent tweaks.

As understanding molecular biology, really depends depth want get. want good understanding pretty reasonably accessible level, I'd suggest reading Albert's Molecular Biology Cell [making [using RNA make old edition actually available free. reading actually assign first-year undergrads introductory molecular biology course TA, typically pretty well-received. want simpler explanation, see scrounge something up, highly recommend trying Albert's section first.

Hope helps! Wow, case/ hospitalization/ death rates going begin plummeting really soon. They’re theatre they’re unnecessary, absolutely vaccines work infinitely widespread. need vaccine funding? postponed another year honest. Next year could probably hold less normal version olympics. poll break responses respondents viewed vaccines before?

It's helpful 60% people already hell-bent getting vaxxed. think messaging pretty clear vaccines path normalcy. people getting idea that's case? Data showing answer “not whole lot, really.”

Like not, things moving. did. early March restrictions eased bars allowed stay open later saw huge jump cases hospitalizations two weeks later plans got put place. 


That mean people following see social distancing going enforced go back 100% capacity. genie bottle 100%.   Lol imagine refusing vaccine.

So option refuse, forcing AZ. literally makes sense. get choice brand pharmaceuticals? leave experts grow tf I’m staying argument either way, think misunderstood point.

It’s expect smaller countries multiple vaccine production facilities, it’s fail it’s problem don’t.  bad idea know health departments general, covid vaccines always free anyone living US. symptoms mine lasted around 16 hours. skin feel really hot entirety next day didn’t bother me. don’t see anything wrong long you’re continuing social distance mitigation efforts.

A reasons: that’s tested, it’s safer/easier that. One shot everyone first, second likely better strategy, sticking neck, you’re wrong you’re liable. What’s safest politically/career wise isn’t always what’s best. 

We’re sure long protection one shot lasts. two shots seem better one. jump 90% 95% double protection, since it’s 1/10 1/20.

Personally British strategy going everyone getting first shot, looping back second shots makes ton sense. imagine lot countries that, especially get data long protection one shot lasts. become anti anti-vaccers site they've gone opposite extreme become pro-vaccine zealots ignore expert advice testimony contrary. fear many superior anti-vaccers scientific truth.

1. fact vaccine discovered side effects mean anti-vaxxers right smart. means they're absolute idiots proves ""mainstream science"" (aka science) *does* care vaccine side effects, *does* inform public vaccine risks, *does* adjust policy protect citizens medical companies, ""mainstream media"" *does* report objective truth vaccines, rational people *are* listening experts. fact happening actually proves stupid anti-vaxxers are. basically blows apart entire ""beliefs"" dangerous vaccines conspiracies. fact scientists said decades vaccines safe there's secret conspiracy lie vaccines - vaccines *are* actually safe if/when issue vaccine discovered kept secret. 

2. Pro-vaccine (aka rational) people *are* superior anti-vaxxers, least topic, they're making decision based science instead memes feelings, that's superior choice. Anti-vaxxers super-informed truth-tellers crusading health safety... they're deluded cringeworthy. 

3. anti-vaxxers listen expert advice testimony. Literally every health organization world recommend something, anti-vaxxers ignore implicit science denial see Facebook video one lone Dr Whoeverthefuck saying feels ""has come forward tell secret truth"" they'll pat back ""listening experts"". called confirmation bias, everyone sense knows that's rational person becomes informed. seek one tiny, dubious piece info confirms want believe absolute ocean scientific data contrary. listen vast, overwhelming scientific consensus. herd immunity threshold depends population attributes likely different country country. particular depends homogenous population ability get infected infect others. Israel relatively young population might contribute lower threshold. one took AZ vaccine take one mRNA vaccine? yes, long wait get mRNA?  A) b) would help? 
Replacing easy, elected population parliament.
New election could take place literally next day.

Sounds like problem poisoning kids. possible something say happen. know people got shots side effects. know people whose first dose side effects second dose none.

It depends persons body vaccine react. got second dose Pfizer woohoo 🎉 people actually think mandate masks every flu season on. Lol. people avoiding vaccination spite. They're avoiding vaccination trust government pharmaceutical companies, simply can't bothered. Many people minor issues vaccines would much motivated get meant could go without mask fully vaccinated.

And morally personally disagree idea lifting restrictions tied case numbers % vaccinated. IMO vaccinations stagnate lack demand, either need lift restrictions everyone lift restrictions vaccinated people (without passports). can't drag restrictions wonder people getting vaccinated. data released EMA (European Medicines Agency) 1/150,000 AZ vaccine. 6 cases could tip iceburg J&amp;J that's CDC/FDA wants wait little bit. want allow reports come people vaccinated window clots. wish people would stop quoting ""one million"" stat - that's likely even close actual risk, reported far doctors even aware look report issue. cares jumps line?

Wait. we’re supposed make sacrifices year save old/sick/obese people covid something suddenly affecting healthy young women we’re ALSO supposed sacrifice safety?? women age (20s) afraid getting covid. don’t deserve people sacrifice us? Group three yet admitted, age. Kind sounds like something Johnson Johnson would say  It’s possible clue works motivations are. You’re going live scared closed life suspicious everyone like this. real question whether major retailers drop mask mandates (in locations they're longer required local law). Indoor masks still ""feel"" mandatory happen, dominos really start falling. else want us do? 

Go ask virus thinks done enough I'll get 2 dose regimen possibly annual booster that's it. getting jabbed multiple times per year long term safety data. realize caring local politics whining, thanks letting know.  marketing guy, hate say something. might thing takes pry door open audience. Yeah definitely. side countries like South Korea, Vietnam, etc handled pandemic really well get much higher percentages vaccinated population achieve herd immunity. Hopefully pull people willing live rest lives bubble wrap.

Who said anything ""the rest lives""? bad understanding situation get better direct relation well people follow safety protocols population gets vaccinated? 530,000 deaths knows many people permanently injured what? Loved everyone... Except country point take someone hospital vaccine reaction? partner got Pfizer Wed fever least 102.2.  Thermometer messing sure accurate is. really bad chills also. something likely resolve something now?

How country navigate it? go back get vaccinated next year, need stay home six weeks till two weeks second dose? yea based demographics people likely hardcore anti-vax, isnt surprising. im pretty sure read somewhere feds gonna start distributing based demand dont quote We're right precipice able operate much normally. vaccine campaign US going really well, we're approaching 50% first doses, start see significant decline cases/hospitalizations, spell beginning end.

You're also vaccinated - according guidelines, close unmasked vaccinated people. Sure, public stores additional rules, honestly even basic mask wearing seems longer strictly enforced. Society moving forward regardless guidelines. ""new normal"" going us years - see masks worn public, people much aware others showing visible symptoms, remote work continuing thing. mean hermit - going take people adjust back way things before. Like not, defining global event generation, like 9/11 generation. seeing effects long time, matter guidelines set government. What's important vaccinated consider safe, longer need torture yourself.  would make wanna first goddamn line. Maldives literally paradise earth. course am, doesnt matter im getting vaccine. Im referring people got everyone else Facebook page got it. Makes sense. get vaccine mean get COVID. really fair comparison True. see many people playing face/mouth one on. May well lick everything. Uh. No.

It's global pandemic deadly highly contagious. solution problem. Get vaccine face giant outbreak kills another 500k+. Really hard. free.

Or, ya know.. don't, put importantly, others, risk. fyi california, take 80 hours paid sick leave get vaccinated recover side effects, employer cant make use vacation sick days that. law affects employees businesses 25 employees also retroactive used vacation sick days, show employer law give days back welp guess I'll wear masks public rest life then. universal Healthcare last administration states said loud across media vaccines would free, coulda avoided this. Sadly. might frustrated planned obsolescence built equation. I’d say we’re already seeing beginning states. NY NJ begun trending plateauing months, Florida Texas too. Let’s honest one thing states good at, it’s making money. Even though trump handcuffed companies exports, US vaccinates every adult, companies gonna allowed shipping countries. literally thousands lives billions dollars stake. would world wide outrage stopped producing exporting vaccines vaccinate majority adults Ugh know headline kind misleading (like every article nowadays) man want again. Yearly flu shots kind optional people good health/not old. Covid deadlier really good comparison flu shot knew them. every 5-10+ years something, fine, that's like tetanus shot, etc. jfc virus come end keep getting jabbed often. punished lockdown getting vaccine even discussion? sound evil you? 

Honestly winds vote go anyone vows abolish public health related emergency powers million blod clot terrible idea.

As someone part impacted demographic (young women) frustrating keep seeing people cite 1 million statistic. given know, 1 million chance someone like me. know exact risk, probably prevalent 1 million demographic. got J&amp;J vaccine, perhaps would get even know now, I'm glad paused investigate better understand inform people risk. would lose confidence CDC FDA recommendations pause, especially since Pfizer/Moderna US. Yeah, read article pissed. npr too, expected better. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:
  
[Vaccine FAQ Part FAQ Part appointment bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* think people well informed. hear mask repeat that, researching much masks work barely help. 

So don’t think it’s cult, people bare minimum.

Tbh would preferred govts making n95s mandatory last March sending everyone free. Would ended pandemic way faster whatever else they’ve tried do. doesnt make sense?!?! counting number rare clots recorded Covid infection vs vaccine. would include asymptomatic cases....the clue name....ie, symptoms = clots.

It's looking rate clots Covid, would include asymptomatic cases. based argument COVID vaccine flu vaccine, somehow hesitancy fear death flu vaccine get COVID vaccine?? trying mean reasoning seems little flawed.

FYI none COVID vaccines north america attenuated viral vaccines (the flu vaccines are) way fundamentally different. can't ""get covid"" vaccine fwiw. Also covid vaccines proven much effective. Joe Biden Donald Trump meet person produce joint video statement encouraging Americans get vaccinated, would never happen, live worst possible timeline. care less do. I'm criticizing whining. unseemly.  Good getting COVID shot, would refuse flu vaccine? understand getting around it, medical reason like egg allergies - they're free (or least covered insurance), safe, side effects. 

I've getting one every year decade almost never get sick flu season anymore. Worth jab+minor inconvenience opinion. know worse ever though. Back kid everyone hung pretty much views 

It’s worse it’s easier find like minded people extreme views extreme views often promoted algorithms engaging. Reddit Facebook suffer first problem Facebook (and twitter YouTube) considerably worse second one. yes classic ""if committed crimes worry police block 7 days week"" wonder people like now?

The people like changes CDC guidelines. Trump's administration measures fight covid, yet clinging one thing, even Faucci CDC updated stance.

I one surely envy weigh options choose. Faucci made wrong statement there, like GOP follows instead Trump. also get flu shot every year. I've never many brutal side effects vaccine true. make things lot smoother. Pfizer says we'll needing one every year, like flu shot. think another Hunger Games-type experience find booster shot? NC 5 times size 1.5 million people, 2444 cases today 18 deaths today too. coworker scheduled get J&amp;J Wednesday provider canceled appointment. new Pfizer appointment Saturday.  states efficient turn around. I'm definitely sure episode animated series. communication plague Dramia II. Yeah agree there's regulations 2 masks (at least live anywhere I've heard of). long something face one cares, matter ineffective is, hence agree cult cloth statement statement. Oh lol, that's certainly interesting. Especially something specific temperature storage requirements hope you’re right. It’s already depressing enough told keep distancing masking vaccinated specific exceptions; prolong “new normal” even torture IMO.  presumably boosters given ad hoc/staggered instead trying vaccinate like 200 million people course 3 months. Low middle income countries gets doses COVAX thus included statistic, COVAX doses need authorization exported.

EU export low/middle income cpuntries well, shown document. scam? many vaccines work. get new flu shot yearly virus mutates. would different? almost whole family taken AZ none issues. Sure risk outweighed probability getting COVID.  Personally like maintenance off. I'm less conscious keep whenever leave home. course knew them. case study two previously healthy young men 30 died CVT due Covid published 2020. general public media didnt know doesnt mean anything. people cared people dying Covid, specific ways. Deaths indeed appear mostly logarithmic, 'spiking' per headline - though daily cases definitely spiking; daily peak 9151 April 9th 2021; previous high 8122 June 14th 2020, daily case curve course pandemic looks like half pipe. Still, including deaths headline clickbaity bullshit. may happen - case spike pretty fresh - may Celestino Aos, archbishop Santiago, hospitalized Saturday testing positive Covid-19, according Fr. Andrés Moro, spokesman Santiago Archdiocese. Aos released hospital Tuesday. Monsignor Alberto Lorenzelli, auxiliary bishop Santiago lives archbishop, also contracted virus, Moro said. received Coronavac vaccine.

Those pretty high-profile breakthrough cases. Catholic country, Archdiocese capital city, two highest ranking members Diocese, live household, vaccinated, infected post-vaccination. cast clear, public doubt efficacy Sinovac (although Archbishop hospitalized Saturday released Tuesday entirely likely efficacy preventing severe infection much effective efficacy preventing symptomatic infection). Still, bad look vaccine terms enthusiastic adoption remainder population. saying entire class stay home around someone tested positive? Oh god. hate needed /s there. Oh really? Please enlighten me, oh great one, brand comment vaccines causing blood clots peer reviewed, thread vaccines causing blood clots, response comment waiting evidence peer reviewed. that.... seems really low. AZ 7 8 million right? reallllly. ones actually effective anyways AFAIK number include doses sent COVAX exempt authorization process. Yeah, admit sporadic flu shot person myself. real reason, never went way it. young, healthy, figured get flu whatever. Obviously jumped chance get COVID shot start regularly getting flu shot now. know pro-COVID vaccine still think getting flu vaccine waste time. doctors main concern virus, economy people’s livelihoods. 

They’ll always recommend conservative approach could potentially save even one person virus. Unlikely case. Look case numbers Israel - achieve level drop cases/hospitalizations/deaths, political maintain restrictions society (although imagine voluntary mask wearing may become bit thing while). 

This sort thing continue keep virus bay - needed all, allow us fend new major outbreaks, still large portions world unvaccinated next years continue lead clusters popping vaccinated world. idea crush levels COVID small number, continue use boosters every year keep antibody levels high add additional protections new variants might causing trouble. successful this, rates COVID spread society drop like stone remain low foreseeable future. Take look subs OP posts joke aimed guy think pro getting vaccinated early potentially deadly disease mean CDC studies show wearing 2 surgical masks even surgical mask + cloth mask effective. don’t get n95 per say.

And yes know people flimsy cloth masks even bandanas face, probably nothing, guess people wearing mask cause it’s rule live, they’re bothered protected.

I’ll wear single surgical mask I’m errands. Easier keep even outdoors vs taking on, putting back etc. I’m using public transit I’ll wear 2 cause let’s face there’s always times you’re crowded bus idiot sitting near takes mask sneeze barely covers mouth (happened days ago). Yeah last fall former director CDC saying he’d rather mask vaccine (wtf?) Hello, conspiracies “the vaccine gives chip, vaccine grows 3rd limb, vaccine made deep state, vaccine killed X famous person, vaccine made x z things found x poison, vaccine make infertile, vaccine make zombie,” like continue, spread misinformation sit right personally. point passports, yes, anyone working mind could notice Covid vaccine passwords would thing. think countries best interest let people country carrying virus could kill citizens. Regardless, that’s discussion another moment. Cheers! really think 4 states gonna hold 46 done away think big surprise lmao. They're gonna gone August, feel free !remindme Ship Michigan high rate states.  Yeah, idea immunity life surprising. However, ""within 12 months"" specific. Yes I'm stats finally! Got first shot Pzifer yesterday. Really sore arm already better.  way treat covid simply treat flu

Not right now, course not. change longer raging pandemic killing thousands people every day. become like flu, treat way. Well remember Pfizer looking infections, serious symptoms trial. 

Also, trials sorts problems since many serious cases placebo control groups. efficacy rates two vaccine trials explicitly report hospitalizations efficacy outcome make latter issue clear. AstraZeneca vaccine, one person control group severe COVID-19, eight people hospitalized; Johnson &amp; Johnson, 34 people placebo group severe COVID-19, five people hospitalized. It’s true zero vaccinated people hospitalized either study vaccines took effect. numbers small, can’t draw reliable conclusion high efficacy may Diana Zuckerman National Center Health Research pointed Johnson &amp; Johnson trial, “It’s misleading tell public nobody vaccinated hospitalized unless also tell 5 people placebo group hospitalized.” She’s right. can’t confident predicting effectiveness precisely wider population outside trial, either. example, vaccine trials included relatively people older 60 see fragile numbers looking compiled severe disease. **In Pfizer trial, example, one vaccinated person developed severe COVID-19 versus three placebo group—which meant single bout disease made difference calculated efficacy rate 66 percent one 100 Novavax Oxford-AstraZeneca trials, zero people severe disease vaccinated group versus one control group, adding subtracting one would even dramatic. **The problem even greater deaths. efficacy analysis, two vaccine trials—for Moderna’s Johnson &amp; Johnson’s—reported COVID-19 deaths control groups.** think main concern world shut avoid covid symptoms people encouraged get vaccinated.. 8x seems like worryingly low number. Let use vaccines documented effect. That's valid question. healthy skepticism ""experts"", I've found Fauci reliable source info.

He says eating restaurants know more.'

The way look it, balance risk reward. love eating out, much I'm willing go take mask indoor situation 20% population vaccinated.

I'm willing limited activities another 6 months. people luxury. go work put kids school. eat restaurant go gym. wold add risk others small reward myself?

I also look places like Michigan. legislature took governor's powers lock away. Case numbers soaring ever since. see real-world examples happens open soon, hard decide cautious.

Might time know we'll never handle virus either live lives not? Sure, might. would expect lead prudent people finding way stay safer going lives. may mean developing better masks wear time. might mean engineering better indoor air filtration systems.

I've seen first hand Covid mean someone. cousin got mild case back March, 2020. still trouble sense smell lot foods taste wrong her. Many taste smell like vomit gasoline. living full year. think worried whether she'll ever eat given lives mostly plain pasta potatoes. financially well access best medical care can't help her.

I'm willing continue take precautions rather risk living rest life like that.

But think pandemic last forever. already good vaccines developed really short period time. expect improvements. take several years 2 shots get status controll covid get back new normal. That’s true. thought Johnson Johnson’s AdVac technology revolved around Ad26. Wouldn’t start scratch new vector? Don’t think pharmaceutical companies compensated. Actually read article, mentioned recording April 1st, two weeks ago. Plus, headline misleading. considering boosters variants concerns. majority population they'd still quite protected, highest risk population extra option safe. us virus, mild symptoms tested antibodies blood. take risk vaccine? I'd rather risk COVID again. almost symptoms according doctor take vaccine right officially FDA approved. True. I’m thinking tri-state region California last holdouts mask mandates, states likely begin phase May August. maybe none FDA approved MRNA research vaccines minimal none! Yes, instead get 500 news articles vaccines never work boogeyman variants coming need hide closet get vaccinated. logic goes. think lot variant fear driven scientists much focused uncertainty average person. They'll never say something safe; they'll say there's small chance dangerous. months back, seemed like big concerted push get people double-mask push stopped.

I wonder got dropped. use %pts work percentage point changes seems fairly well understood. got mine two weeks ago tomorrow I’m male I’m worried. Best luck you. I’m sure fine. wont happen lifetimes. fact politicians want get money insurance companies, Americans it. Yeah, they're getting chemotherapy surgery free means tax dollars going 'communism'. That's Bernie never won. need say 'communism' people go ape shit. Like pulling trigger. Little know America become glorified third world country. Getting first shot Friday, like? Send New Zealand please. don’t know anyone knows anyone who’s one super rare vaccines Great. already hear antivaxxers gathering new ammo. Yes, I'm aware that.

Convincing people follow public health measures, however, **is** political thing. turning ""us vs. them"" thing way go convince people follow said measures.  Depends industries, types jobs benefit in-person collaboration. Also, office helpful need space invite clients vendors meetings. workplaces also offer free perks employees, free gym, free coffee snacks, etc. cut dry saying office spaces waste money. highly dependent specific case.

I say, though, commuting horrible contributor carbon emissions, huge reason cut in-office days even companies need keep office around. suggest going Turkey, pretty relaxed enters long negative COVID test. Makes sense, don’t think fact really... useful? It’s going really help us convince vaccine-hesitant people get it, messaging “if you’re vaccine hesitant you’re dumb” probably actually going change vaccine-hesitant person’s mind (even though it’s true 😬).

Like, feels good say “LOL anti-vaxers dumb” actually help us increase vaccine uptake? I’d image using messaging would make anti-vaxers dig heels  Israel didn’t see significant case decline 56% adult population fully vaccinated.

We less 30% fully vaccinated. (Fully meaning doses, etc)

It’s simple math.

We’re herd immunity yet, it’s simple. Including people got infected.

We’re simply near 60% antibodies. There’s still ton susceptible hosts around here.

Edit: current projects 6-8 weeks away vaccinating everyone wants one. I’d like cite single instance 30 percent preschool class died COVID.  They'll want end midterm elections. took chance worked 2020, work again.  No. insurance, might charge insurance actual cost administering shot, cost cannot passed along you. insurance (or choose provide insurance info) government covers it, believe. 

In case, cost get shot. given syphilis. lied getting treated it. somehow went decades. Imagine kid can't even afford car seat.  How's part find vax killing us? Cool lockdown ordered, one complies it, really happen? Same. I'm done. wonder J&amp;J held? know 'pause' ends supply chain, e.g. delivering immediately restart okay given start administering gov't even shipping states happens. Based Israel model, likely. regardless infections, Covid almost irrelevant Massachusetts. 10 people dying per day state nearly 7 million people. Natural selection call Probably reach go back normal now? understand annual covid. Flu shot ever stop wearing masks?  Well, reason trials also find dose kids need. adding this. Tentative dates full FDA approval Pfizer/Moderna? takes one news headline like ""26 year old pretty white girl dies J&amp;J vaccine"" create media-fueled outrage feedback loop, even said 26-year old made decision fully informed. 

It's people receiving shots, people watching news shots, FDA take long-term view make sure people continue trust medical system. combined flu shot twice year. guess long run every 2 3 years probably year meantime world gets vaccinated target long time, effective seasonal flu vaccine something resistant likely pandemic strains.

Pandemic flu incredibly fast, much faster burns COVID. want vaccine ahead time. wish treatments like would get press become widely used. Would help Covid anxiety much! think changed? Vaccination elderly, new variant?  Yeah lol @ guy clearly live here. never locked either. turns 2x per year shot people going pissed. year flu vaccine hard enough get people take Lol, guess so! It’s crazy think even covid sub people believe masks going away soon bc anti-science states already took away mandate, iirc cdc projections continued masking up/handwashing/social distancing throughout summer minimum enough population gets fully vaccinated would argue already much endemic point. I'll gladly get booster, COVID first endemic, airborne blood disease we've circulate society. Thanks putting together everyday! 

Knew matter when, disheartened see first doses tailing already. know headwinds J&amp;J (15M dose supply &amp; clotting) well younger, working folks remaining population...but would liked see us 55-60% tail off. Manchester airport, point, case patterns NH pretty much everywhere--the bigger city densely populated area, prevalent covid is. seems incredibly optimistic. states seem running extremely motivated individuals around 30%? Sounds like you’re going lot! aren’t alone feeling way do. admire drive dedication going out, despite OCD (which would quite challenge covid) — good you. Keep up! Focus power amazing vaccines! They're fun extra money, sure thats component running business necessary waste time creating new product would market. intentionally make first one weaker make buy another, fast mutating virus lives going forward like flu likely.

The virus likely mutate direction symptoms less lethal killing hosts virus's best interest spread, eventually probably fine pass yearly update long death becomes less issue. think there's anything special J&amp;J wont need either, they're getting first batches likely also come booster later. thinking hit 50% start seeing big decline infections? I’m desperate see decline case numbers. recording SSN beginning anymore. [This model Youyang predicts cases start declining week. last updated early March cases still falling far perfectly predicted plateau/gradual rise. Thanks, worry particular mine, come anything ease friends nerves (despite us fully vaccinated).

The percentage actually even lower since said 29% cases asymptomatic (therefore 71% serious symptoms), odds even lower. I'm even anti-masker anti-vaxxer, what's whole point then?

I'm getting sick shit  think thing makes non-issue rate occurrence statistically insignificant, mean direct interpretation term.

At risk pedant, statistical significance means. event extremely rare still statistically significant relationship factor. 

Statistical significance measure likely apparent relationship data random chance. chance low enough (generally less 5%), consider observation statistically significant. difficult find statistically significant relationships rare events, impossible. Copays tend 10-35 depending visit type. know still burden it’s 100s dollars like original comment leads believe. think depends adolescent roll goes yes, think we've peaked otherwise. Many states already hit demand wall increase here. case AstraZeneca vaccine. Still, paying resulted deliveries. get made connection.

I seen news regarding ""cheaping deal"" manufacturers. likely give general statement saying groups need it. probably recommending others universities companies could want seem common sense, everybody reasonable.
I read commentary Australia, relied mostly AZ, got 1m Biontech, supposed used doctors medics, government got vaccinated Biontech early, normal people age wait Q4, might forced take AZ alternative. government says hurry. arsenic. time J&amp;J issued resolved demand start much bigger issue could easily see that. think so. time J&amp;J gets unpaused numbers start ramping up, demand issue supply (its issue areas already) government increase outreach communities? came comprehensive plan vaccinate black brown communities tackle vaccine hesitation increase access. don’t see can’t done communities well. less banked production much better external (mostly US really) production. production ended kinda sucking annoyed couldn’t get anywhere else. This. honestly want one shot vaccine speeds process immunization found one thousands professional athletes hospitalized ignored social distancing masks play sports year. sure think proves point.

Biased mods already deleted post, wasting time.

Zero deaths among pro athletes single digit hospitalizations entirely support academic study trying refute. Technically free pay taxes. Ahh, I'm way! I'm getting shot Monday nervous. 34F children, infertility stuff non issue me. things get stuck head, like random blood clot stroke seizure. hate anxiety. Makes rational people total paranoid puddles. Lol

Good luck you! answers hope find them! Yeah I’ll believe see swore read somewhere development flu vaccine take couple years opposed every year. unusual type clot really ever seen people taking blood thinners, people taking blood thinners. seems they're going path US

Uh? We're still social distancing better US (in EU countries).

It's vaccinations causing problems. Well 1 million Entitled Americans bought fake vaccine cards brought Facebook Instagram Twitter Esty EBay! government nothing nothing nothing medium moguls put prison 100 years mess politics they’re messing peoples lives prison prison prison.
Lol btw $5K fine family afford it. Wtf takeaway it’s impossible

Not impossible shouldn’t standard. allowed absolutely safety become standard. likely die get seriously injured car way grocery store die coronavirus might contract grocery store. think 200,000,000 doses administered tomorrow. know Biden goal 200,000,000 doses one hundred days, I'm totally clear many doses administered Trump. Either way first country reach 200,000,000 doses absolutely fantastic.

According CDC, 20.4M doses administered January 19th, meaning 22M doses go hit 200M 100 days goal. vaccinate population first though?
 America supposed do, EU didn't. I'm European btw. Denmark talking 2-4 weeks extra get either Pfizer Moderna. around 500 daily cases covid-19 5.8 mio, highly unlikely even catch covid-19 delay. share 4 million doses AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine Mexico, Joe Biden plans announce Friday United States contribute $2 billion U.N.-backed program seeking distribute COVID-19 vaccine doses people poorest countries world, according senior Biden administration already allocated money December U.S. Agency International Development provide Gavi, international vaccine distribution alliance. Congress provided total $4 billion officials said U.S. would give rest Gavi course year 2022. Man watch second Moderna shot. Got mine yesterday I'm feeling like shit. 

Obviously completely worth would 10 times to, first shot nothing second shot ass. Manchester airport, it? Maybe contributes it.... first dose average peaked? Also Canada. surpassed USA somehow cases per capita, keeps rising. seems vaccines way out...and major supply issue even AZ J&amp;J issues. Correct. CNBC trying panic people, usual.  doctor doesn’t follow *The Science ™* instead professional opinion differs big tech?  I'm living america, know current thoughts allign mentality there, kind fear could end ""dam breaking"". 
Everyone tired restrictions business owners want reopen save existence, really get it. So, allow vaccinated citizens move freely, also seems reasonable. 
I fear could lead everyone who's yet vaccinated basically go ""Many already vaxxed, need get shot can't track everyone's vaccination status."", leading sharp decline vaccination numbers potential spreaders meeting up. acknowledge firm anti-vaxxers likely never take shot unless forced employer goverment, consider scenario.

I'd happy CDC makes recommendation caviat opened states needing percentage citizens vaccinated encourage participation. all, nobody really wants re-enter lockdown sanctions case numbers spike, seems like one-way street me. 
Does seem feasible expecting much cooperation? essentially quarterly dose I’m no. Manchester cases state (11,000). Unsurprising since Manchester biggest city state. Nashua 7,400 cases. Salem 2,800 cases.

Both Manchester Salem 10% population diagnosed covid. Nashua 8% diagnosed covid. nothing mRNA not.

It's exposing another antigen. think reason would ""incompatible"". even j&amp;j az. another antigen tells lot worth European lives days; read article vaccines mostly went Japan, UK Canada (obviously low middle income countries). Thank god US enormous domestic productio otherwise wouldn’t even started now. seeing rise hospitalized cases children Pfizer, Covid last July. first dose 3/22 second 4/12. First dose: chills, fever, muscle aches, sore injection site. Lasted 72 hours. Second dose: chills, fever hours, soreness injection site, headache. Felt back normal 36 hours following injection. Back Fauci knew effective vaccines would be, predicted least seventy percent population would need vaccinated reach herd immunity. believe accounted natural immunity, believe considering we'd dealing practically perfect vaccine.

Based current numbers, feels ***extremely*** likely United States near herd immunity July. still cases course, cases bubonic plague, think overwhelming majority people, including politicians, consider we're position seventy percent population vaccinated.

I suppose main question would much natural immunity pushes up, especially children. know virus spreads quickly among kids, CDC estimates four undetected infections every positive test. think that's going state state issue based much natural immunity present based state actions throughout pandemic, going bit hard predict, good news that's great. That's Kessler, who's Biden admin, Pfizer CEO. However, agree comment hearing quote CEO jump conclusions. course CSNBC throw panicky headline. lol what, posted new Yep. serious AZ J&amp;J side effects seen women aged 18-48, whole-heartedly agree affected populations able opt out, opt another manufacturer. However, side effects seen demographics, need continue utilize them. environment people prone spread misinformation, prudent wait extra 30 min 1 hour full story. clear they've updated CEO stated they're abundance caution, know we'll need another shot 12 months. thing Moderna said back January.

""So think planning purposes, planning purposes only, think expect may boost."" Man, around mostly Moderna, they're throwing away vaccines like crazy. 

I got second shot yesterday said ""you last appointment today, please tell anyone wants one stop by. quite few.""

It 2pm...

No one waiting anything. see continuing I’m ok that. I’ll take chances J J. ever comes back market shocked i’m downvoted you’re not...

Reddit moment I've really impressed well LA handled getting vaccines people. Every time looked online I've seen open appointments. got vaccine one MEGA pod / Govt run sites well run pleasant experience. (prior pause) giving J&amp;J family members joined person getting vaccinated. friends mostly 30's I'd say 90% received least one shot without line cutting. (eligibility, volunteering, sites like CSU Bakersfield opening 16+ weeks early, leftover doses, etc.) Oh wow that's concerning indeed. Thanks reply tho. Same, Pfizer. First dose fine - little loopy hours. Second dose cakewalk. Statistics fine unless one Edwards talks weight loss took month  I've read risk blood clots less deemed acceptable treatments (birth control notably). Brought paid AstraZeneca. I'm happy see development I'm also starting worry J&amp;J may bigger problem younger women initially thought. anybody read Twitter thread Dr. Vinay Prasad counter concerns?


[Yesterday said J&amp;J vaccine Game women 18-50, 6 cases 1.4 million vaccinated age group (~1/200k), say missing, anything? really. We've several heads state get covid. job brings contact lot people. pathetic propaganda, wonder shills frequent sub 85% vaccination right would think mask mandates really make sense. Would prefer wore mask anyway? Yeah would. we're 85% tell go fuck there's real rationality behind argument. Pfizer someone special? also problems Argentina remember right. Well, might dead! certainly restrictions right now.  think cdc needs start making appeals ""this needs start ending"" group.

I agree. driving outside Portland yesterday large electronic sign flashing ""Vaccinated Not, need wear mask""

This course true, phrasing awful.

If young healthy person fence vaccines see sign government, would motivate go get vaccine?

We need stop authoritative puritanical start working people motivate make safe choices. No, didn't. Afaik study done efficacy one shot mRNA vaccines beyond period ~month. know effective would several months year. data one shot J&amp;J two shots mRNA vaccine definitely feel J&amp;J. grandmother got second Pfizer shot accident week prior put hospital. trouble getting around begin effort getting site second shot. wasn’t even sure she’d hospital time it. single shot vaccine like J&amp;J would lot easier. Weske, 43, stopped buy dipping want put toxin — I'm kind anti-vax, period.""

&amp;#x200B;

I sat five minutes trying come something say here, can't.

I love/hate relationship word toxin. gets overused incorrectly used many people, hear someone say mostly know ignore pretty much everything they're going say since people actually concerned real toxins generally calling specific things they're worried about. One things study mentioned actually verify people blood clots.

When talking 5k people blood clots chances misdiagnose handful cases low. 20 people 10 people actually blood clots data chances completely.

More could people found unknown health issues. Maybe initially find blood clot next weeks find 5 actually undiagnosed cancer and/or issues probably caused clot. 

With cases drawing significant conclusions near enough impossible based potentially early unfinished testing potential causes. Stupid decision. reaction. think United States going begin exporting vaccines stockpile large enough vaccinate every single adult. expect us still continue building stockpile vaccinate children vaccines approved children, think we'll continue build stockpile without exports shots even administered. really know, export strategy could change time new information comes out.  posted video removed Facebook crux saying techincally, ""FDA approved"" vaccines, government officials saying lying. correct, COVID vaccines gone full approval process, allowed distributed emergency authorization. FDA fact sheet EUA says Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine vaccine may prevent getting
COVID-19. U.S. Food Drug Administration (FDA) approved vaccine to
prevent COVID-19.*

*HAS PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE USED BEFORE?
The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine unapproved vaccine.*

*The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine undergone type review as
an FDA-approved cleared product.*

His video harmful, misleading, mostly true, probably removed. change time. know infect people, showing symptoms, *days* even experience discomfort Covid? Right? I’m glad staying healthy boosting immune system.. problem viruses, infect *other* people too.. you, it’s everyone come contact with.. whether healthy enough endure infection, infect people can’t. California, example, J&amp;J makes 4% vaccines stock. 

My wife appointment next week, J&amp;J get make new appointment. true. Full authorization (BLA) involves inspection manufacturing facilities, detailed run 6 month data, whole host stuff. Would say maybe summer time...maybe fall? think there’s chance we’ll able sit inside library year?

My town library removed seating that’s one things miss Pre-Covid life. libraries don’t allow food anyway, keep mask mandates longer want to. post, though upon review source specifies residents 16, Reddit post clarify. anyone else (other me) lost most, all, sense taste smell getting moderna vaccine? called doctor told worry, clearly states every source ive read side effect  74 deaths approximately 77 million fully vaccinated people. also it’s important get many people vaccinated possible continue reduce spread Covid. Fresh oven: [BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 Vaccine Nationwide Mass Vaccination study group included 596,618 persons. Estimated vaccine effectiveness study outcomes days 14 20 first dose 7 days second dose follows: documented infection, 46% (95% confidence interval [CI], 40 51) 92% (95% CI, 88 95); symptomatic Covid-19, 57% (95% CI, 50 63) 94% (95% CI, 87 98); hospitalization, 74% (95% CI, 56 86) 87% (95% CI, 55 100); severe disease, 62% (95% CI, 39 80) 92% (95% CI, 75 100), respectively. Estimated effectiveness preventing death Covid-19 72% (95% CI, 19 100) days 14 20 first dose. Yeah yearly flu shot doesn’t exist anything like that. important all. save lives, educate new generations, clean streets, grow crops, invent anything. has, pretty spot Covid19-Projection's forecast. asked GP MMR booster, told vaccine usually cheaper booster, might well get booster. know high risk settings often titer make sure good, guess depends.  sense smell means went brain

Obviously factors come play, like whether vaccines (or soon be) available, piece puzzle nonetheless  Good.

Those still really good numbers, put high risk situations to?

As said original comment, data whether get vaccinated long Covid organ damage like asymptomatic mild symptoms.

But seems willing put others risk eat ""normal"" life. Seems pretty selfish. booster South Africa-based spike. think saying reasonable said that. mutation rate likely slow people get immunity. Even influenza shots strains updated often particular one. Usually one strain updated given year H3N2 usually mutates enough require new vaccine every three years H1N1 every six influenza B every 10. common cold coronaviruses mutate rate influenza B probably future thing long run idea downvoted. resolve anxiety often take baby steps facing it.

The maddening thing (undemocratic) mandates coming unnamed experts using unverifiable data.

Transparency always key. love science. love science's independent verifiability. I'm blocked immediately become skeptical anyone else should.

For one week post **second dose**, UK found 86% Israel found 94% efficacy. 

UK study: study: steadfastly restrictions continuing indefinitely. think carrot get people get vaccinated ""targets"" things like 70% vaccination rate case numbers.

I'm sure specific date started vaccinating 65+ end January. states *just opened* everyone month. Vaccines take 6 weeks become effective. target would 2 months plus 6 weeks full reopening.

The not-in-person part used called “homework” hit 70% would think even don’t complete herd immunity cases, hospitalizations, deaths would low enough wouldn’t need restrictions really. especially since lot 30% don’t want vaccine people don’t believe following restrictions likely lot them.

even natural immunity isn’t good vaccine probably isn’t sterile immunity amount time, it’s probably enough keep anyone going hospital get covid again, really matters. don’t disagree either points, great news im excited get second dose pfizer two days. don’t think Johnson &amp; Johnson seen inferior vaccine outside very-online-people. Anecdotal evidence course, plenty people know prefer J&amp;J it’s one dose; least pharmacy got Pfizer shot Pfizer J&amp;J, told ran Johnson &amp; Johnson that’s everyone picked - wasn’t late day.

After this, might right.  Haha really wonder he’s going say that. Probably we’ll end pretending like “100 days masks” never actually thing saying thing, opposite direction.

Instead 100 people getting infected, get 5. That's vaccine ineffective 5% cases. polyneuropathy

UK vaccinated (one shot) lot higher percentage population US. 61% people UK received least one shot. US number 37%.

This largely due UK stressing full population coverage first dose rather people fully vaccinated doses.

Because single dose fairly effective (at least short term), public health perspective choice better choice. 

Anyway, different coverage can't use US UK data compare Pfizer AZ.  done now. Pack walk away come you. don’t think anyone field education believes kids better zoom school real school. Especially young kids don’t even know read—wtf? 

This much socialization. don’t need zoom school learn interact technology (are seriously concerns kids keeping new technology?) save one person banning it, wouldn’t ban it? 

What person someone family??? It’s right decision he’s bit naive, IMO, “drastically improve faith public health institutions” won’t change minds whose minds made Mine gives free car seats low income families. Health departments great potential resource anyone bad financial situations. mum actually first dose, she’s NHS lead nurse! think month ago got hers.

Bc get covid twice variants Time bust tranquilizer guns whole article ""covid mutating like already 7,000 times one mutations could possibly lead becoming deadlier"" speaking absolute numbers right, people die sure (directly indirectly).

But also ethical issue. giving something healthy people without even knowing potential risk. Moreover safer alternatives certain demographics. love people like ""look, astrazeneca vaccine better pfizer"" data uk based 1 dose. dude beast!

While Moderna already effective booster shot targeting variants E484K like mutations, needing another round shots big problem many countries Yep, dad covid despite medium symptoms, done good terms. almost heart attack. Why? exams, blood cot vein next heart blocking 90% it, causing heart failure. surgery put thing expands vein artery, saved. 
 
To honest, like hear side effects vaccines. ideal, but, compared covid variant nothing. average 3.5k thousand deaths day country, hospitals full, medications incubation running low, variant getting young people old really. Hospitals average 30 something years old ICU now, lots younh people 20 40 dying it, healthy people. Sure, still low percentage compared many got specially age, growing. Death rate average 4% country. 

 
Id take vaccine heart beat Even risks exactly same, blood clot transmittable people come contact one. net societal risk still lower vaccine without it. Finally got second Pfizer shot i’m fucking hyped get back normal lots factors involved pull different directions.

They also likely free time middle day go get one vs younger folks. also likely mobility issues like difficulty driving, issues getting appointments things online.

I think hard generalize 65+ number subgroups. Sad even pay it, many people can’t afford it. I’m still shocked people don’t realize *horrible* side effects overly cautious policy decisions made March/April 2020 were. Ignorance bliss guess.

I would include erosion public trust institutions side effects, made harder obtain compliance restrictions vaccination efforts ever since. global effort. supposed scheduled get 2nd Pfizer dose Walgreens says upcoming appointments? trying re-schedule originally scheduled come 4 weeks later.

The entire area around zero appointments available really need 2nd shot.

Thanks. Yeah, that's for-profit organizations (though government know civil forfeiture tickets). first step 100% everything done. happened Arizona within week mean 100% like masks tables still blocked off? 2 weeks later everything completely open maskless. expect thing happen Denver.  quite remarkable much better things gotten past months.

In December January hospital inundated patients. Almost every floor converted COVID unit, patients double sometimes triple roomed, outpatient physicians pulled cover inpatient floors.

This past week saw one COVID+ patient whole week rounding, even asymptomatic positive admitted non-related issue. protected period. Likely infected body mounted effective immune response vaccine. know free got vaccine still surprised free. Healthcare ""free"" compute here.

Seriously, surprised hidden fees lots paperwork ""qualify"" pay dose. genuinely surprised quick easy was. literally brought along book read barely able finish chapter; longest wait 15 minute wait check allergic reactions. got wiped out, (got first Pfizer shot yesterday). reason thought I’d condition school work (I wasn’t) failed one quizzes lol   New Hampshire open non-residents, IIRC - might time road trip!

Depends age. 30 I'd plan fever feeling bit rubbish day after. might not, happened every friend mine aside one second doses. Really strange experience though like actually sick, feel bad bit body goes immune response suddenly feel completely fine again. Happiest I've ever fever tbh. Let’s get Ricky Bobby administering shots way NASCAR events. I'm hearing covid test $100 us fake paper (fake negative test result) $10 us

That true? get fake papers? agree saying. feel factors play here. India UK given AZ vaccine millions people without blood clots. 

This issue seems way common countries. factors- maybe common medicines diet factor people prone clots. like deaths due covid extremely high west due obesity, age, etc factors. know later.

Several countries happily take vaccine. Lol, come now. people actually feel way people fence. 10% vaccinated get infection. 10% vaccinated people **who exposure would cause infection unvaccinated person** get infection. required outdoor settings remain required indoors public transportation.

There indication report B1.135 growing faster rate relative B.1.1.7. bonus. Herd immunity end goal. Herd immunity achieved vaccinated people able pass virus on. they're protected infection - herd immunity possible. They’re side effects moderna slightly frequent side effects second dose. lot might dose timing though, moderna 4 instead 3 weeks apart means stronger immune reaction buildup first dose. vaccinated I'm American excellent employer paid insurance ($500 deductible, $3,500 max pocket) minor surgery (10min outpatient) STILL terrified bill I've yet get.

American health care sucks, one ever believe lie tens millions people love insurance want public option, people love insurance ones pay premiums ever use it. Actually experience healthcare workers get tested all. medical center affiliated medical school, medical school people get tested weekly, medical center people (you know, working patients) get tested symptomatic. No, no, that's load bullcrap. Also, ""toughest"" ass. GOP controlled Michigan legislature literally sued conservative judges overturned attempts Democratic governor's attempts control pandemic.

I guess, someone like people stormed Michigan capital firearms plotted kidnap governor blockaded hospital, ""no indoor dining"" asked wear masks ""draconian"", surprised Michigan spiking assholes probably going around licking doorknobs. per stimulus acts, cost person always $0, insurance insurance company pays, government pays. matter what, person always zero pocket. saw post r/Connecticut someone charged administration fee UCONN Health. copied doses purchased U.S. taxpayer dollars given American people cost. However, vaccination providers UConn Health able charge administration fee giving shot someone. **Vaccine providers get fee reimbursed patient’s public private insurance company or, uninsured patients, Health Resources Services Administration’s Provider Relief Fund.**

Just wanted make sure people know uninsured place get vaccine asks fee, tell bill Feds. pay pocket. Hahahahahaha fact 100% free insurance communicated far more. know many people know this.  Danish government also stated spread covid suddenly exploded, hesitate start using AZ again. Interesting perspective. Might give lower income countries level playing field. well  difference side effects pretty minimal vs Moderna wonder dose timing explains lot differences. I’ve elbows deep COVID patients past year

Let fucking vanity metrics  Nope go get it. CDC incredibly forthcoming transparent throughout entire thing, seeing thought process give everyone faith thinking *everything* through. arguing propagandize. However let falsehood stand vaccines protect infection, argument get vaccinated protect people ring false. Herd immunity happens vaccinated longer conduits virus take one unvaccinated person another. vaccine mainly using EU? pause AZ J&amp;J, won’t things slow down? Like said, it’s literal miracle. lifetime kind win. 

But “total shots administered” still vanity metric So… Hicks sticks refuse pricks put us fix. get shot. arms gets better. It’s weird California dropped drastically cases yet still 100+ deaths day. female 30s got j&amp;j last week don’t loveeeee wait see thing. know chances incredibly small gotten step ahead covid anxiety shiny new anxiety. Definitely depends US Tragic considering Japan’s path setup Olympics equally tragic. Thank you! wear mask dining indoors No. USA blocked export vaccine raw materials. Serum institute needs materials produce vaccine currently, importing USA. Since USA put block exports, SII facing acute shortage since late Feb. raw material runs out, wont able manufacture. 30% US adults say flat get vax, according latest polling  yet pubs open. Snap lockdown immediately needed. purposes convincing people get vaccine, free. Someone gets vaccine pays nothing pocket.  commenting rubbish analogy anything else.  Inb4 Moderna shots start showing blood clots people 30s got COVID didn’t die Source? here, 19 years old, felt extremely ill 24 hours (temp 39 degrees c one point), second jab booked may. Also regrets :) 7-day average? think trial let (not sure call English) personal doctor give AZ, he's closer patients (as could possibly predict risks better) easier come back check ups?

Bigger Vaccination Centers wont using far know.

I wish could get vaccine right now. far count people met personal reasons (apart family rarely ) year one hand. think firm dates shared public. I'm hopeful latency EUA applications vaccines used past. argument positive effects vaccinating AZ outweighs risk people dying upvoted parroted throughout thread.

Which valid opinion have, least thrown discussion. 
 Yet people voicing opinion likely ridiculed kind thinking relation anti-lockdown rhetoric; positive keeping economy going outweighs lives lost. 

There massive difference tens thousands lives lost per country average (and multiple hundreds thousands bigger ones like US) due COVID, single double-digit number people affected extremely rare side-effects AZ J&amp;J vaccine, affected rate even necessarily correlate amount deaths, believe people affected J&amp;J vaccine survive ordeal.

I understand getting bit disingenuous lump people category obvious difference statistics present.

And get it; opinion life lost one many, sure cannot go around risking people's lives vaccine that's meant save them.

Then again, many people would died covid vs. amount people would died vaccine, delay cancel it? type estimates hard make. decisions even harder make; whose lives going sacrificed regardless? 

Someone could gotten vaccine week, next week, couldn't? someone get vaccine die due it? terrible course. ones likely occur?  Maybe 

A lot remaining un-vaxed either vax hesitant, totally vax resistant. Latest poll shows 30% US adults flat get vaxed additional percentage wavering line. 

Those enthusiastic getting vaxed likely already got shot. leaves hesistant, indifferent, flat resistant left. going hard convince. 

We know herd immunity percent is, right still air when...or even IF...the US reach it. might like ""Libertarian Police Department"" bit New Yorker never read before. Thank comment!

This comment. 

Since then, CDC announced numbers worse COVID vaccine demographic (though I'd like see accounted 2-week delay clotting compared people already took vaccine). 

So info since comment, seems mean vaccine safer COVID. curse, since places like United States alternatives, still make sense give young women. um...wasn't whole point different kind blood clots respond effectively known treatments lethal? 

this comparison less worthless cost, giving hope giving end date based thresholds. purpose saying insurance companies know primary is? true. work facility administers vaccine. clinics willing participate reimbursed local government funded federal government.

It's possible vaccinate 300 million Americans free without putting clinics pharmacies business.

If insurance, ask driver's license number social security. documentation forwarded government turn reimburse clinics. take it, fact outed clinical trials whats concerning me, dont know blood clots happening, know do.

I want take something might super high risk know risk factors yet. Maybe 1 million gen pop, 1 100 less certain number risk factors. Already young female seems risk, pregnancy? preexisting conditions etc. medications?

My best guess last sentence makes comment sound negative towards, least, AZ vaccine. people skim comments basically read first last sentence, see could misinterpreted.

I personally disagree amount negative coverage AZ, interested latest J&amp;J developments, since paused ""*abundance caution*"".

IMHO, way less dangerous average person percieves be, guess people *might* die vaccinating (because fears/bad press/etc) would everyone world vaccinated using AZ exclusively.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: People mad might percieve comment negative toward vaccination. mean said facilities 100% capacity? need vaccine healthy. worries. sounds like panic too. anxious experiencing panic hold muscle tension funny places. Strangely, hold onto right side, lower back. also get sore throat jaw pain tension hold mouth, neck tongue. getting majority population vaccinated different concept you, personally, getting vaccinated. Ah ""maybe"".

I'm taking I'm going 6 months year pretty standard. depends much want keep think worth end.  Let's say testing durability device. whack 6 times hammer, still working. know survive hit hammer least 6 times, conclusion would draw ""hey, looks like pretty durable"", ""oh god means going fall apart gets hit hammer 7 times"". They're continuing hit vaccine hammer, hammer time every swing takes month, wait definitive answer. Level CLEAR Better premature decisions. ignorant  honestly seen government say thing people needing get shape, that's shame much worse virus overweight obese people Ayeeee same!

Kudos good immune system! Sorry, read post ass. know mom huge. Yeah that’s issue, people general (including me) gotten used hoping something happens instead actively advocating it. lol /r/YUROP Yep, exactly. first dose today, asked insurance card, said didn’t insurance said fine continued process. hiccups snags part it, giant vaccination clinic inside hour. Quite literally one easiest things I’ve done long time.  really hate smug are. really weird kind reaction work. pass sight blood, one inflicts wound. Shots another medical procedure blood visible? problem. Accidentally cutting finger chopping vegetables? floor meeting soon. OK proteins prevents recognized immune system threat, versus this, generated mechanism? never claimed was. said 55% would 2.5 million people. insurance actually pay? vaccine covered administration fee. Seriously cant much get flu shot 20 cash insurance places covering admin fee shot. go doctors office something. Seriously doubt insurance would cover much, father still pay see insurance mass covering 180 shot stick you. Hospital, pharmacies, medical clinics paid administer vaccine. That's willing participate, otherwise would go business trying vaccinate 300 million Americans.

The facilities bill patient bill insurance company. insurance, take information like social security number driver's license number bill local government local government agreed reimburse facilities. product American system making people think healthcare privilege. Sad It’s almost like vaccines virus  poor person injected suffered untimely heart attack. didn’t think free, assumed health insurance paid it. weird don’t advertise that, free would kind big deal whole lot people  vague unintelligent response, competent medical field, largely free one matter. dragging heals threat Aus, early one govt stated wanted results national rollout. Seems like good call me. guys 20km shit creek would expect similar safe road response. u start quoting murdoch media vaccinations shambles, look why. due unfulfilled vaccine orders, already paid. employer sent email basically saying whatever need get shots. PTO time work deducted. get go whenever need to. done beginning. burned everyone's patients start instead dealing fact going long hall. due time. I’m obligation eat even pre pandemic, I’m doming others never eating indoors don’t immediately resume vaccination. Where?

For example, take state, Washington. metrics? I've heard metrics move phases three-phase plan (that're changed around whenever governor cares to), heard metrics remove restrictions entirely. risk rest us? they’re filling hospitals can’t get care need. specifically measuring determine whether works not? bloodwork before/after? Iron levels? What's Omega3 Omega6 ratio? HDL cholesterol? 

Are levels improved since going Vegan? fudged numbers lot. Interesting! Thanks sharing. I’d surprised it’s anything generic “things getting better yet, America” kind message 7 died J&amp;J paused shots. really think 10k died without us hearing it?

Honestly, wonder would better vaccinated high risk older aged groups. younger people seem recover COVID fairly well. People socially distanced six feet apart, certain values 'six feet'. PolitiFact article saying opposite arguing. Read again.

So specific: sources show Florida's numbers, they're currently reported including totals point, wrong?

Dr. Shamarial Roberson, black woman Democrat, Deputy Secretary Health Florida. [recently veracity FL's numbers. Please provide up-to-date evidence others lying. slots waitlists? Thank you. parents got first AstraZeneca dose last week. Hoping immunity kick soon. 2nd dose would somewhere May. won’t happen everyone once.

Some people attitude since beginning. Others felt way recovering COVID getting vaxxed seeing vaccines open adults simply developing pandemic fatigue. every day, people cross camp.

Public health guidelines? bet we’ll see fade obscurity public stops caring. They’ll place, won’t feel essential. Unfortunately, that’s consequence public health policy that’s slow pivot harm reduction rather full-on risk aversion. article clinical trial...

And yeah, clinical trials werent challenge trials. Literally everyone knows this, mean controls. Depending trial, shit ton matching control feasible variables. feel challenge advertise beyond telling people get vaccine, need help let people know wants vaccine fact mentioned. thoughts perhaps canvassing campaign hammering fact home? niikeels Yep. long history needles due heart problems. I'm used ""fish"" vein even little, used feel vision closing in... skimmed article seem say many 2+ weeks last shot, vaccination supposedly highest strength. Playing devil's advocate, sure affects women age group. 6 people group know chance? report one male developing blood clots trials data point suggesting women. great terrible example one person (Bolsonaro) *can* make difference world... good bad, case, bad. helps, completely prepared feel super ill Pfizer dose 2, instead, feel completely fine. bicep bit sore move it. That's all. So, go want say agree you. Right early dropping masks (but, early setting groundwork - I.e., one month every adult eligible shot, month half now). said, Reddit wouldn’t didn’t enjoy debate. 

The people saying, “it’s early, give *just* another month two”, saying thing 2 months. people extremely risk averse individuals believe masks walked back virtually 0 risk infection community. *never* case. 

My suggestion? Pick date, stick it. June 15th, don’t know. Far enough away appeases overly risk averse, must stuck to. Regardless happens, June 15th, masks longer mandates, social distancing, 100% capacity everywhere. Covid over, June 15th. something like that. Sorry no. I’ve spent year “very worried” I’m going fully vaccinated weeks I’m spending prime years worried this, I’m going live life. Yes, I’m going wear mask public however long it’s required I’m going put seeing also fully vaccinated friends family worrying people anymore. confirm, pandemic also political issues (estallido social) help government sparse, people quite desesperated work money family last year living trough reality, total hell. fact got online job hop back get salary know would happened us eat government giving us help fact people almost obligated work almost service jobs downtown like pandemic months ago. 

Chile holding much, we're done politicians, security nowadays lots people working even coup respect also whole ""plan paso paso"" (step step plan) putting counties work others even considering we're next lol complete MESS. think COVID protein deficiency?

because get bill government more. Hard find credible data. work data shows 2k deaths reported 20-29 y.o. 2019 us census shows age 24 - 34 46 million people. 1 25k 20-29 y.o. die COVID. Quick math partially combining two age groups denominator. J&amp;J would still benefit group carry higher risk profile. everything perfectly hardly anything - super solid start pandemic last spring. probably second time. first time asymptomatic spread thousand people. air current prevents virus landing surface longer 3 hours? point virus die/become non-viable remaining airborne? mean looking data dispassionately, make sense. Someone died unexpectedly statistically number blood clots outlier. happened past weeks might take longer blood clots occur people, makes sense pause watch longer see.

If establish causal relationship vaccine blood clots rare say 1 million, dilemma. Statistically still far better people get vaccinated, hard sell vaccine even 1 million chance killing you, intend giving hundreds millions people. Wow. awful. Yeah spot on. anyways normal assumption vaccines given healthy people. That's lot caution side effects. 

Unfortunately, seems lot people, Americans particular, completely flipped perspective vaccines out. everyone saying trust science. want see results studies support certain rhetoric. Anything mildly scientific risk vaccine side effects needs dismissed immediately whatever basis find kind culture war society. going another country EU seem like race Brazil US see country fuck things entire world?   


Can't say much, Canada well getting vaccine(s) many people really starting fuck things rest us here, too. :( course situation ICUs worsening, case tally growing fast days ago (and still growing although fast).

Hm? +46% increase comparison last week, ~30,000 new infections today. know AstraZeneca causing clots yet? 
I see lot countries restricting 60’s. Risk actually getting COVID dying it, somebody demographic, factoring age, fitness, general health: 0.000001%

I think I'll take chances. much risk covid-19 risk catching covid-19 spreading others might vulnerable.

The way stop Pandemic limit virus's ability spread.

That vaccinating vulnerable anywhere near enough.

The point found Pandemic many people obsessed risk death, much consider.

Yes risk death might small consideration long term effects covid-19?

We know many people area still suffering long covid-19, know covid-19 cause organ damage even fit healthy people. 

So simple covid-19 kill me. CSU incoming... (I hope not, fear worst) vaccine one-time risk

I know that. looking like covid vaccine become annual bi-annual vaccine (like flu shot).

Now, could also say vaccine present side effects, risk presenting side effects future vaccinations small.

However, could possibly say covid. symptoms/risks covid every time get it?

So, here's would say. Get vaccination A. risks smaller, also B. controlled environment scientists continue improve formula.

Rural areas dominated older people, group performed amazingly comes getting vaccinated. 

I think problem cities young people don’t get vaccinated can’t bothered. 

I think voting good thing compare to. can’t bothered get butt vote (young people), likely aren’t going get butt get vaccinated either. probably already possible already COVID-19 may cardiomyopathy, known long-term effect natural infection. probably brought light strong immune response vaccine causing heart attack like symptoms. know! get tired hearing “it 6 7 million people”. Yes sure include ages genders. still small, number gets larger narrow high risk group. covid cause it,than vaccine, contains part virus causing virus. Maybe allergic reaction? confirmed, ofc would right.

So far, dont know that. Depends sub suppose. 🤷‍♂️ promise I'm leaving sub moment hit 2 weeks second shot. like stay loop.

This morning went gym. 3+ weeks first Pfizer shot. got second shot Monday. going wait least next Monday, reading studies first Pfizer shot's effectiveness, decided take plunge.

I'd lying said second thoughts drive there. hit 2 weeks post second shot, think I'm always gonna little nervous. Even after... whole virus messed lot people's psyche. kids going college, may worth swaying becoming therapists. Gonna great profession next years...

The moment got started lifting... new person. Almost everyone mask on, wiped machines—which, whether COVID spreads surfaces not, nice change—and feel better. I've slowly gone back normal - weekend road trips, seeing friends, etc... felt like major step. Good return normalcy. factor risk COVID causing blood clot risk getting COVID first place.

You also factor *every person line* could catch covid-19 someone caught you. getting infected yourself, might save thousand people getting infected. talking someone Oklahoma, would tell worried it,"" Nicolelis told Bojorquez. ""Because Brazil control, world control weeks. variants brewing every day, every week… escape."" vaccine risk 2 times probably one time per year, would be, really don’t need look longer 2021, soon Moderna, CureVac Biontech/Pfizer (and maybe Novavax) steady production, nobody going use AZ anymore. 

So you‘re definitely calculating lifetime risk covid, 2021 risk getting it. think COVID protein deficiency? libertarians think smart shit come smug dipshits. pretty typical side effect symptoms. ...but risk dying COVID much higher risk getting blood clots vaccine, regardless are. free drive bum fuck stadium 2 hrs away, sit traffic another hour, give random volunteer insurance information, get shot... That's fuckton hassle depressed ass. maybe I'm odd man Lol Reddit probably worse  inflamed 

Why inflamed? Thats new me. Haemorrhoids become inflamed, yes, inflamed veins cause Haemorrhoids.

Actually question wrong. didnt mean Haemorrhoids anal thrombosis, root cause Haemorrhoids. guess Haemorrhoids inflamed anal thrombosis?

Some people get anal thrombosis often others, maybe genetics play role too. question was, develop anal thrombosis often often, (higher) risk develop thrombosis body. therefore brain thrombosis too. Hurts seeing country massive beautiful Brazil getting fucked like this. mention, people, alternative get one “safer” vaccines like Pfizer’s. Ground single appointment difficult enough let alone 100+ time. Could get placebo. Totally funny. I'm tired pandering willfully unvaccinated: Adios amigos! usually do. Especially information new me. find couple reputable sources, I’ll generally accept it. comments sections worlds better Facebook mods decent job too. Something like 20-30% adult population say won’t get vaccine ever.

That might good point would compare AZ vaccines / vaccines car accidents. dont. dumb. Whats chance (someone cleans groceries, school room, N95 rare chance must leave house. add chance ill clot covid. Low fuck. 

What odds young female multiple hormonal treatments, clotting disorder, brain aneurysm issue AZ? Probably higher. 

Why cant people understand subset people significantly higher risk?

Why practically shamed take different vaccine thats safer? cant people understand everything risks higher clot risk concerned covid safe catch wait get mrna vaccine? 

I get itll slow vaccine roll ridiculous. force shame people get vaccine unnecessary risk? Give low risk demographic give mrna risk group. people worried getting covid make sure safe daily activities..... pointed risk CVT COVID likely overestimated. likely underestimate number COVID cases US, result, overestimate many people get COVID get CVT tried well eventually relented. thought free made unsure. Medical professionals live lives scamming people I'm surprised would wrong one thing that's free. fully agree first part. Wow, blows mind it’s slow guys. people CA entire country. Hoping speeds y’all! agree guess what, that’s birth control pills got approved FDA, 1/3-1/5 blood clot risk compared actual pregnancy. They’ve begun that: CDC says fully vaccinated people hang inside without masks. :D I’m gonna get hug grandparents again! 


The problem 1 person household school _doesn’t see point_ getting vaccine breaking social contract makes less effective/safe everyone keeping risk catching/spreading COVID/ it’s contagious strains like b117 _some_ vaccines stand preventing a/symptomatic infection others don’t. 

Eventually masks go away, anytime soon. People also getting lazier handwashing already makes easier variants develop due COVID’s nature estimates infections converge 3/10 US infected Real Americans worry shit. Bring on. Another question is, even causing blood clot issue? possible people vaccine complication would even worse situation actual covid? Maybe maybe something consider. didn't. Thanks info. already perfectly safe vaccines moderna pfizer/biontech products year problems nobody going use AZ J&amp;J anymore (the EU already said won’t prolong contract).

The choice „I hate vaccines don’t want any“, „I want safe vaccine like ones already market.“ Exactly. get covid eventually? heard talk eradicating virus. matter time, bring vaccinated hopefully make less severe happens.  is! get 2 hours that. know free got anyways. fair EMA supportive vaccine. whole argument US export vaccine all. Zero. literally nothing bid first place. 

This jumping line. fairest process would common procurement scheme everyone pays price allocate according population (this EU internally). gives smaller / poorer nations equal access keeping prices fair everyone.
Instead got various nations seizing local production skipping line throwing money problem, fucks smaller nations dont independent vaccine production particular vaccines proved successful also fucks poorer nations throwing money Pfizer secure allocations simply inflates price without leading production. That’s hear case. Second acting protein spike training body got first. Covid/antibodies already. would make sense body would act like shot one. It’s already detected. Shot 2 bit easier hopefully. things considered think CO leadership nailed timing things. shut little popular opened 100% little popular. 

That's sweet spot honest. past stage hospitals get overrun. enough high risk bodies without immunity get (especially furious pace vaccinations)

If unvaccinated uncomfortable risk, making choices keep safe. comfortable risks, allowed please. 

We personal responsibility stage this. share news Brazilian media already reports intubated patients able keep sedated stay awake intubation equipment, definetely inhuman treatment. tragedy patients go try survive, doctors submit patients this. I'm frustrated, angry, can't express revolting situation many deaths suffering could avoided pandemic taken seriously authorities, specially federal government. Good point. 

There likely many, many factors. Maybe higher infectious doses received lead breakthrough cases make deadlier, instance. could go on. Well short term, eligible mean everyone chance get vaccine enough time immunity develop.

There still potential 80 million people may want vaccine, 1.6M first shots day would 50 days. allow time immunity develop, around 65 days. based upon current average human's behavior. One effectively lower risk COVID infection 0. Full stop.

So choice nonzero chance coivd infection vs vaccine risk AZ J&amp;J. two myriad options available including effectively 0 chance covid via hard personal lockdown period time opportunity get one mRNA vaccines.

Not options available feasible everyone sure options limited riskier vaccine vs. escalating risk COVID everyone either. know *I*, Data Scientist makes living assessing risk find funny - people extremely selective **data** cite order make pre determined argument. 

If truly making data driven decisions risk, would seeing following policies: 

1) fully vaccinated people whatever want. masks, distancing, nothing. growing scientific consensus says vaccinated persons contract spread covid (the likelihood extremely small). 

2) everyone 35 vaccinated - full return normal. According study, even new variants, people 35 lower risk dying covid-19 dying roads given year. Based CFR well (page 7), know upper bound. cautiously backed data overall approach going. feelings. 

Cautiously? Yes. Backed data? think it’s early tell, *actual* policy recommendations come match actual data bases risk insights. **In fairness**, actual recommendations CDC *very* different messaging coming CDC director, Fauci, executive branch government. CDC recommendations much line point 1 - vaccinated individuals contract spread covid, messaging figure heads different. Unfortunately, still get Covid vaccinated. CDC investigating lot breakthrough cases. Everyone drawing conclusion damn obvious. numbers even close equal compare worst blood clot estimate optimistic Covid estimate. mistake many people making brining individual level nonsensical. *Maybe* odds getting Covid rare maybe suffer major consequences like exceedingly unlikely get blood clot. numbers small hard comprehend.

Scale even understand argument keeps coming up. matter 10 blood clots 8000 20 4000? Bring Brazil, need reduce transmission avoid new variants also reduce ICU cases deaths wait vaccines. We're big country.. never heard anyone talking iver saying get vaccine. anyone say I'd say they're lunatics said vaccine, other.

I never heard anything 10x normal dose, look much. Oh yeah going bad. mid-23rd century transporters biofilters? That's fair. definitely follow doctor's advice anything read online, vaccine options see AZ cannot low risk group mrna prioritized high risk clot groups.

If read article, says risk clots AZ 5 per million risk Pfizer Moderna 4 per million. small numbers occurrences that's practically difference, second that's much, much less chance something bad happening catch Covid (whether that's clot something else). consipracist perspective always seemed malice AZ politics, profiit clickbait serious medical concern.

Please try buy weird hype AZ 'dangerous' clearly dangerous either vaccines medications people guzzle without thinking every single day. sent article feels better now. qualifies weekend hoping find appt soon. decisions made medicine time. Every drug side effect doctors determine whether prescribe benefits outweigh risks. Like person risk stroke prescribed blood thinner risk internal bleeding. well UK article seem access moderna like Pfizer’s. actually PROVEN vaccines Pfizer cause brain clots though. studied level astrazeneca? Free? Whose paying funeral? pausing vaccines again?

Would feel comfortable **you**, family member loved ones, anyone else know love 4 1mil, 5 1mil ? 

My answer no, see strokes blood clots nearly every week. severely debilitating folks need assistance literally everything rest lives, wiping ass, feeding themselves, speaking, drinking... everything. 
 understand pausing safety efficacy concerns. J&amp;J particular, case studies shown vaccine already 70% effective preventing severe covid hospitalizations, means still moderately susceptible getting covid thus getting blood clot rate 40 per million PLUS 5 per million getting AZ J&amp;J vaccine. Couldn’t agree Polish government. U.S justify delaying J&amp;J Pfizer/Moderna work horse countries without alternatives justify continuing FYI, vaccines largely prevent infection altogether. 100%, studies coming pegging around 90-95% so. Oh think you’re vaccine gonna last forever? One time shot? Cured covid? got source that? whole blood clot issues it’s lot Europe much higher Europe don’t want take vs U.S. understand comment. said ""Real world settings unlikely airborne spread"" ended ""Surface transmission rare.""

Can please clarify? two statements sound contradictory other. Well Dr. Miguel Nicolelis, indirectly telling fully protected even though “fully vaccinated”. Nobody saying “panic” but, don’t go around thinking something actually aren’t. wouldn’t categorize “very worried” “very uninformed.” saw random political survey yesterday 6% people never heard Mitch McConnell 7% seems right people 0 attention news Well, getting jab person's arm requires development, testing manufacture vaccine. One without useless. think question US government paid development, get vaccine cost, everyone else, think there's particular reason profits go Pfizer. would way less wealth transferred billionaires. Chlorine dioxide big problem country months ago, especially anti-science reporter recommended pretended drink live tv (before lot facebook posts recommending fake story village Bolivia zero cases apparently everyone drank it). lot cases poisoning, including death 10 year old kids whose parents gave lot started developing covid like symptoms. Sadly, solution completely prohibit sale product while, even approved industrial uses. That’s true, early reports looking like don’t develop VIPIT first dose viral vector vaccine, you’re probably clear. 

Taken grain salt though pretty data pretty much stuff early tell. Agreed 100%. Acknowledge may rare reaction, cause investigated. far seems young adult women affected maybe restrict vaccination group. However, pause entirely appears absolute worst case scenario 1 death per 3.5 million people fucking stupid reactionary. simply done appease group anti-vax would never gotten vaccine begin with.

If every single American forced get J&amp;J shot 100 people would die. month we'd zero covid deaths. Likely zero cases severe illness long haulers. We'd fucking done this. Also people covid? vaccinate? got first dose! Thought sure walk outta paying like $20 (which would've perfectly fine), free! That's even better $20. Go socialism! think bit complicated that. There's legitimate reasons worried yes, chances developing blood clots low, absolutely idea causes person susceptible blood clots following Covid infection vaccination. would know might find 1 million person? 
 
Then 2 perfectly valid vaccines, Moderna Pfizer, yet lead reported cases blood clots. really blame people thinking ""Why would get AstraZeneca J&amp;J, small probability killing me, could get Moderna Pfizer potential side effect?"" 
 
I'd different story knew made people susceptible blood clots case, people doctor could determine whether complete safe get AstraZeneca J&amp;J. Well COVID definitively lead strokes/clotting, there's doubt it. protein deficiency also genetic condition, assumed OP referring since described ""very rare"". Uk 3 months apart. Canada 4 months. Delaying fine. Stop exaggerating said. 

It’s premature say masks can’t required September. would think maybe more? That’s taking account people still taking precautions like masks social distancing activities. big amount population vaccinated (even full herd immunity yet) people going follow precautions anymore, unvaccinated population part vaccinated population high probability get infected covid new variants contagious flu. lifetime probability would high specially natural immunity doesn’t last lifetime think saying papers making excuses using vaccines massive oversimplification. multiple things play here, let's split two chunks:

1. harm/benefit trade-off AZ vaccine across particular groups population? 
2. individual AZ vaccine worried?

The first brings play risk serious harm covid vs risk harm vaccine viewed aggregate across millions people. number countries concluded analysis means different alternatives may better suited groups.

On hand, second question absolute risk individual suffer serious harm vaccine, eg one blood clots. case, may want compare risk potentially fatal risks experience (and probably ignore) everyday life give perspective chance happening you.

Both valid analysis, mutually exclusive: person 30 (or wherever want draw line) might better getting different jab, same, probably overly anxious developing rare type blood clot get dose AZ.  countries went AstraZeneca access Pfizer yet.  It’s you. rest us aware US administration change January. Agreed. open size real world environment see outliers notionally. 

The question whether expected unexpected (the 74 deaths / 5800 cases). don’t think (based article) cdc ready make determination. # vaccinated constantly moving target think data help understand efficiacy vaccines severe covid deaths even better. point missing we're sick living lives inside four walls. I've cooped 56 weeks wife three children ranging high school first grade. oldest basically full revolt months, borderline hating us letting give whole thing run around boyfriend friends think hoax. middle schooler bit understanding, equally frustrated hates world. little hates everything know direct it, gets directed everywhere.

On hand, would still take could get appointment tomorrow. guess we’ll see, super rich haven’t exactly done right thing man, Panama papers among things slowly tilted realizing peasants lol concerning. Everyone immediate family least one shot! 4 Pfizer 1 Moderna. know it’s anecdotal really think we’re starting turn corner here. Minnesota starting sail too. That's one-off figure guess, higher ones. suspect there's bit backlog. I’ve neighborhood gym whole time wish could hug every single person didn’t organized physical fitness outlet last year. wouldn’t made it. Oh think know that, that's entirely different issue Keep mind people sixteen can't vaccinated yet. Young people unlikely die go ventilator, young people known develop long covid long term symptoms. also immunocompromised people can't vaccinated, can't form robust immune response.

We rapidly approaching point adult chooses get vaccinated can, I'm going lose sleep consequences choices vaccine skeptics. need somewhat concerned children. long every patient knows expect, that's OK.

I like countries stop vaccinating certain vaccines entirely.

IMO, everyone allowed weigh risks get shot want.

I would feel safe could go next vaccination center get jab. strongly believe one. instead, J&amp;J vaccination stopped entirely Germany risks evaluated.

Heck, would even jump car head barracks doses currently stored (about 50 miles live, instead 5 miles next vaccination center), could get f\*\*\*ing shot way. Americans fucking dumb government really think people going socialize?

to fair, Trump anti-social president. Things different Biden taken role. excellent. Thank sharing. thought podcast something read. Agree im extra safe havent left house like year minus one month school labs. would never subject adenovirus vaccine well. actually told physicians wait see clotting effects showed vaccine first rolled scheduling. advice still strongly recommend higher risk people get mrna vaccine. 

We also know risk getting covid top risk covid clots higher vaccine. risk covid alone social distancing low risk covid clot low. risk vaccine clot low general population unknown higher risk clotting groups. 

Clotting covid much likely hospitalized patient. get mild covid, even risks, risk likely lower. 

The big issue type clots. vaccine specifically causing clotting disorder causing cerebral clots (especially bad brain aneurysm) covid causing peripheral clots break cause pulmonary embolism stroke vaccine specific clot personally would fearful of. 

I believe everyone aware risks make decision puts lowest rosk harm possible. vaccine options see AZ cannot low risk group mrna prioritized high risk clot groups. know absolutely insane, people also consider impact greater good beyond vaccines way pandemic? really said rest world kurwa Good points! recommending useless hand sanitizer give guidance lower risk. Nothing ventilating spaces etc. still wonder HEPA filters would help (maybe they'd make worse?). study would cost what, maybe grand? could published info effective mask types, even distributed material. Believing conspiracy theory would comfortable compared terrifying idea people charge really stupid. Well matters guess. 

But yes, expect full data subset patients (ie. fully Vaccinated) considering CDC setting apparent network states feed data into. 

This seems something interested understanding. clearly state demographics don’t lend pattern. would interested see links patterns determined (the fact predominantly female 18-49, comorbidities etc.) Hello fellow hockey player fairest process would common procurement scheme everyone pays price allocate according population (this EU internally). gives smaller / poorer nations equal access keeping prices fair everyone. 

Had case mRNA vaccines developed all. country would willing invest vaccine production infrastructure reward getting spot line according population. 

But I'm struggling understand citizens ""smaller"" country like Canada, chosen invest production capacity work manufacturers set up, deserves ""equal access"" something another country spent billions produce. 

Canada money could've done Israel chose to. develop capability produce pay premium get earlier, exactly getting fucked over? US do? They're kicking ass far vaccine distribution goes, know they're comparable Brazil's situation currently One whole points European procurement process companies would made liable. yes. seems like local issue though. states release vaccine shots age info, around 40% 60+ year old vaccinated once. Bremen almost 50%, Mecklenburg lagging bit behind 33 %. Worth noting, Israel specifically excluded previously infected individuals initial vaccine rollout, additional 15%-20% immunity top vaccinated portion. US exclusion, overlapping immunity, would likely need higher percentage. Pfizer moderna better ? currently covid second time 6 months. rarely leave house leave I'm extremely careful social distancing masks. I'd much rather take miniscule risk vaccine giving blood clot catch deadly virus third time Yup- even that. 
Won’t get issues like anyone dying covid doesn’t mean covid. covid stimulus like 10% actual covid issues, stopped tracking flu, mockingbird media exasperates it. great cause mail unsolicited mail ballots. It’s great long list. 
Many senators great investing right covid- right Microsoft deal- right vaccination deals. 

Haven’t thought covid issue family 8 months. Still wearing mask social distancing. taking chances. coworker anti vax virus office closed. vaccinated two doses? great point. best part even need everyone vaccinated, need 1-(1/R0) x 100% population immune disease begin returning normal life. Wouldve vaccinated jobnson johnson hold :( Tell ask doctors please, random people internet. risk merely catching covid importantly getting seriously ill. vaccine makes avoid almost %100 Literally. pandemic rules made people brainwashed they’re unknowingly turning anti vaxxers. literally addressed next sentence. even health officials government lifting restrictions vaccinated people realizing people already hesitant get vaccine, many see point need keep after. problem see hard compete message politicians pushing return normal life whatever happens. mask mandates illegal business allowed restrict unvaccinated customers, still easy rationalize ignoring pandemic instead getting vaccinated. people upset this. forgetting there’s vaccine thats 95% effective 100% effective preventing severe cases?  work Idaho. There's mass vaccine site near job watched full weeks. However past month (when shots open elderly), cars parking lot. distressing see. true shot %95 efficacy importantly ~%100 efficacy severe illness. forgetting there’s vaccine thats 95% effective 100% effective preventing severe cases? numbers show huge improvement people read headline smh Shit I'm healthy 30 something shingles fucked world month (and still longer effects like blurry vision perfect vision). virus still love forever chicken pox kid happened. Well mRNA different methods. I’m curious compatibility well. mean guess? many people could possibly tho? relatively new platforms.... think anyone figured yet. That's likely subject studies future studies, particularly mixing different vaccine studies.

Smarter people make educated guesses, I'd imagine options include get 2.0 version whatever (like flu vaccine need track it), booster different folks got v1 mRNA vaccine, booster maker initial vaccine. imagine they'll studies finished issue guidance. Sounds like fall ""let's fuck around find out"" category. Go right ahead... Yeah, hard explain friends back US much absolute shit show vaccine roll EU's reliance AstraZenica. Like idk come reasonable rollout plan need factor AZ's potential fuck ups stage.

Edit: Also, know Norway part EU, tell guys less boat us. I've heard anyone feeling bad 2 days. Nobody know personally felt bad 12 hours. Nowhere near week. 

But rather risk hospitalization, death, spreading friends family, coworkers, etc... cool. Cool cool cool. understand saying urgent care regarding ""going them."" Find different urgent care, ask appointment say ""I got vaccine recently side effects, provider see me?"" insurance, turn away.

Every health care provider knows tell people go ER. cover shift responsibility someone else sticking patient cost. walking, drinking, immunocompromising disorders, need ED. repeat, go urgent care.  India middle religious festival hundreds thousands going Ganges without distancing masks etc. sadly tip iceberg! That’s narrative? may need yearly vaccinations, may not. It’s early tell. suspect least recommended next year. time goes could change Yes safe, fully vaccinated, could cough mouth still safe (from covid least), fun. amount cases matter means exposure overall trials run height pandemic. problem many differences trial conditions criteria make apples apples comparison. people crazy probably probably wont fall sub .1% death rate covid people risk factors? problem they’re saying COVID infection, defining COVID symptomatic infection. really understand difference? issue they’re arriving 8x figure. Aye...one worst beers ever made, i'd rather drink shot vaccine. Could logically explanation cases Michigan high Texas low people willing take J&amp;J unwilling take Moderna/Pfizer happens pull J&amp;J? Obviously.

But avoid cutting short, might want that. Threshold herd immunity also likely lower warmer weather winter majority people get new vaccine yearly .... Exxxactly. false choice! point rather stay safe avoid covid take something risk severe blood clots. Well time yes, thousands die flu,

Plus avoid severe case flu, i'm sure people would want many take shot every year... Even worse Michigan... Last read believe so. Or, extremely unlikely. vaccines 100% perfect 102 fever usually isn’t dangerous. Fever doesn’t start getting life threatening 104+ range. I’d take Tylenol drink tons water.

US election takes 2 years, yet know candidates September. pretty solid actually. living 10khz sound wave ear 24/7.

That terrible. sympathies. You, we, still get covid beware. However, chances bad worse possible outcome greatly reduced, ability effectively transmit vaxxed still point intense study. best part is, don’t worry people getting vaccinated. long I’d vaccinated, thats care about. don’t care someone refuses get vaccine gets covid dies. misleading take shot, probability getting clot. Covid wild wild, 8 times probability becomes infinite. get shot two , stop getting shots. get Covid once, get never stops. Plus risk getting depends normal go back to. relate. never realized many casual sore scratchy throats got year.   three quarters adults vaccinated? No, states opened 60+ AZ mess prio group 3 total. may minority taking blood clot issue seriously causing delays bad thing. shows approval evaluation system job.

However, everybody vaccinated little risk catching covid. Eventually add vaccinated people natural immunity start reach herd immunity. Philly too. true places high prevalence. context Denmark’s positive situation past months - reopening (slowly) without rising numbers, testing 8% population per day, hospitalised, already using mainly Pfizer vaccine - calculation different. 

Reopening postponed this. It’s speeding there’s less cases even optimistic prognosis. assume high confidence ability humongous testing capacity keep cases low. . that's assuming everyone get covid.

It also account fact at-risk ben vaccinated. That's probably true. pandemic really allowed Biden keep low profile look presidential. also sure whether Senate would flipped non-pandemic year. feel though Pfizer absolutely deserves make $50 billion Weed approved U.S. I'm sure done impossible, odds dramatically reduced.

Life goals... conditioned state providing necessities despite taxpayers. societal issue  plenty research coming since least May 2020 showing COVID spreading surfaces highly unlikely.

KvG awesome big screen! going love it! IMO, research public funded, break patent/IP. data showed 4 every 1 million people get American-made vaccines experience cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT), blood clots brain.

AstraZeneca vaccine, works different way similar Johnson &amp; Johnson shot, research showed incidence rate 5 every 1 find quite amusing WWE putting effort promoting vaccines NBA is. NY even need that. needed know name, appointment time birthday. showed paperwork. somehow expected downvotes tbh :) Lets honest. pandemic Trump probably gets re-elected. Plenty places ignoring eligibility rules. lying required, vaccine sites (on occasions) open this.

Plus, people getting doses left end day places *were* observing eligibility rules. math wrong comparing C19 AZ potential. Death C19 hovers 2% range. AZ clotting problem leading death? That's hovering 0.0004%. study math one percentages almost certainly worse. Viruses mutate have, infecting spreading via kids easier, also harming younger populations (see Brazil). Canada sites, private company ready produce mRNA vaccines Canada fuck help get ready production.

Yes, sites produce completely different kind vaccine, based different technology. Changing huge undertaking, matter site state owned private. I.e know Biontech bought additional plant Germany modified produce mRNA. 8 months ago started production. GSK/Sanofi knew December vaccine would work planned. like 5 Months ago even know suitable equipment protein based vaccines would mRNA prodcution. want time travel August last year tell everyone mRNA way go abandon recombinant protein vaccines, please start converting factories asap? Yet countries determined kill two vaccines. covid almost guarantee viral vectors never used vaccines data showed 4 every 1 million people get American-made vaccines experience cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT), blood clots brain. AstraZeneca vaccine, works different way similar Johnson &amp; Johnson shot, research showed incidence rate 5 every 1 Hence government experts making decisions, emotional patients.

Not American, got jab, free, work said sure see later, heres money anyway. 

Absolutely hesitation anyone involved.

America rapidly becoming dark humour, used want live little, would never consider downgrading quality life I’m adult. Hope they're putting money instead relying regular families who've likely struggling last year... CNBC changed title think, saw old one opened it. clotting main danger though. American Healthcare system created problem dubiously charging people TESTED COVID-19 towards start pandemic, reported multiple news outlets...so there’s surprise many would believe vaccine reputation hard obtain wouldn’t cost associated them. tradeoff

words comfort spending weeks/months ICU, followed post-viral complications interminable length. hey, survival fittest right? worth considering, too, lot countries got virus control taking seriously back case numbers small.

My relatives Vietnam freaking small handful cases last winter led zero deaths.

The pro-COVID faction U.S. would say that's overreacting, Vietnam avoided national tragedy last year *not* waiting millions cases take action. Countries took seriously start exactly confidently blame response America 500,000+ deaths jokers claiming deaths unavoidable safely ignored.

That bit ""it's 15 cases go zero soon"" perhaps stupid thing politician said last year, phenomenon grows *exponentially*. growth exponential (for while, anyway), stop total numbers small. people understand math science, also seem see world black white. Vaccines work 100% all. Masks work 100% all.

Why, why, listen? always make fun US especially Trump EU look us now. 

Mismanagement levels government. president EU Council every single mayor every single town continent.

No one spine needed done prevent disaster.

The consequences total failure felt decades come. different vaccines tested side side trials, simple case AZ worse results.

None vaccines gone normal vigorous testing schedules would go pre post COVID emergency. right case particular side effect AZ shown wild, limited affected it.

Given vaccines usually go many years testing still unseen side effects, may yet see one vaccines give serious side effects. I'm saying be, could be.

Hell could find everyone took mRNA vaccines sterile also eat chilli regularly sleep less 10 hours day. ofc ridiculous, point really know full effect vaccines years yet, i.e. equivalent time vaccine would normally stay controlled testing.

&amp;#x200B;

As countries would buy AZ, would probably combination nearly enough vac go round, much cheaper cost AZ, much easier storage transport requirements AZ. Yes wonder. They've obviously wised stance since, noticed? science evolved facts presented, people got stuck handle it. saying shutdown first place nothing. Wonder flu magically dropped record low numbers one died...oh wait “Covid” deaths. He’s reliable source, actually watched video, might realize :) Im saying Pfizer make money get especially low price.

Much much less. 

And, critically, people would still getting vaccinated. doubt people would need booster mRNA vaccine ~6 months, people high risk exposure (heath care workers) severe disease (elderly) might opt extra protection. People received J&amp;J vaccine could also stand benefit less effective, particularly variants. 

Plus, proof concept quickly effectively vaccine retooled target mutations. likely mutation eventually make current vaccines ineffective, even that's much longer line. Without calculating completely, look numbers daily Covid deaths, odds die Covid quite high compared odds die due vaccine. problem J&amp;J AZ seem mostly affect people take hormone pills (which do).

I willing take chances here. really need American comparison visited city world? allows restaurants gyms operate socially distanced maximum capacity it’s fucking weird wear masks concert? reason would really weird wear masks dancing club? guess Reddit neckbeards probably haven’t lockdowns barely worked?

They work, things ever started going wrong end lockdowns. Lockdowns much quicker bringing cases vaccines. locked January relied vaccines cases deaths would stayed high much longer whilst everyone getting vaccinated.

Yes, unexpected things come up, drugs withdrawn, people well qualified medical/life science professionals agenda protecting public safety. 

Trusting experts (however unfashionable is) long way ""just knowing heart vaccines safe"". link actually disagrees first (Flu) COVID-19 contagious respiratory illnesses

[Compare smallpox eradicated, mainly spread direct fairly prolonged face-to-face contact people. New article subject that's worth We’re dumb. little Moderation would’ve fulfilled purpose. Yeah, makes sense, wonder exposure enough virus extended period time effectively “overwhelm” vaccine antibodies. know nothing science though, maybe I’m grasping antibodies work many have.  Among started survey announcement Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine pause, half (52%) considered shot “very safe” “somewhat safe” - twice number believed “very unsafe” “somewhat unsafe”. announcement made, figures converged - 37% called vaccine safe, 39% feeling unsafe. Remember /s satire, please. died 15 times car accidents Bhopal spring make government look bad drive conspiracy theories. /s. really bad optics matter desperate anyone feels vaccine, 10 years road, people going look say chose good vaccines donated riskier ones think key thing ownership intellectual property. right, government manufacturing capacity. pharma companies bring table. given ownership intellectual property. stay funders R&amp;D. dish manufacturing lowest bidder. companies make profit, outrageously high profits get patented products. 

So medicines countries need urgently, vaccine pandemic. pharma companies want develop statin that's 10% effective older version that's coming patent, free money patent well. masks diminish hearing abilities? Yep someone yesterday asked insurance covered it. Barely believed said completely free Side effects range nothing sore arm pretty intense fever, headaches, fatigue chills. 

If spare sick time, terrible idea also decent chance needed. Classic Reddit thinking it’s smarter people specialize kind stuff lol pause allow time get right treatment information clinicians.

Right, info now. news discussed randos Reddit. reached clinicians yet, different, bigger problem. Right, poster says, authorities different regions consider likelihood infection availability alternative vaccines compute risk assessment. countries currently suffering pandemic, take jab get. not? That's infection fatality rate is: deaths per infection. population, rate said. say make sense calculate that's defined? happy outdoor areas restaurants/bars opening - think huge effect people already gathering groups outside weather permits. bit unsure reopening gyms etc. hope people comply mask mandate, especially indoor situations. Yes, vaccine hesitancy similar here, 30% believe average.  CDC website used say ""there maximum interval doses"" want get within 6 weeks first shot.

I'd rather go longer early second shot. would prepared take sick day, hopefully won’t feel to.

Seems people 2nd shot basically similar first one was, maybe touch worse. wonder people dying old infirm simply respond well vaccine. words, extremely high chance dying normally existence statistics could skew death percentages. efficacy rate, % people got infected fully vax. Let's pretend catchy fill hospitals, hospitals capacity lead avoidable deaths.

So yes UK strain directly severe lethal. infect people clog health care system. good, though! /s CDC website.  determine bad batch yet champ? Lmao NBA come saying would fine players cut line? risks SARS-CoV-2 infection fully vaccinated people cannot completely eliminated long continued community transmission virus. Vaccinated people could potentially still get COVID-19 spread others. 

You might still able infect parents even vaccinated. saying want take risks all, maybe wait pub visiting parents also vaccinated. Again, Merkel hero need. I'm afraid medical mistakes drug reactions too. TBH never wore outdoors even getting first dose. mandated pretty useless. Maybe dumb appointment sites stop asking health insurance. refused give see, thanks, makes sense. Preprint here: would grappling injuries sustained intense dancing WAP clubs. I'm sure infrastructure would able handle it. problem (these CVTs causes, combination low platelets) number matches background rate general population. moment nothing suggest mRNA vaccines causing problems AZ apparently J&amp;J. 5,800 77million full vax bad all, 0.00008285714286% I'm guessing many high profile players already used wealth connections cut front vaccine line. PR event would need either use fake shots exclude bunch marquee names. Likely would harm good point. There's enough information really. goto hospital get covid tested. know went covid, went something else happen covid even know Sao Paulo state said expects run crucial intubation drugs, needed sedate patients, next days, paper reported Wednesday.

What sad situation. wish people Brazil best.  would expected, considering data, 100,000 people vaccinated. 

More been, would expect number rise.  couple things:

1) 100% literally impossibile statistically. result obtained ""small"" contained trial. real world close 100%. people weak immune systems little sadly. also true vaccines, 100% possible. 

2) can't compare mortality like also controlled trials estimate efficacy vaccine. Why? assuming number people got covid first place vaccinated non vaccinated population. 

Let's say 1 milione people non vaccinated 1 milione people fully vaccinated. 

In non vaccinated group 10'000 people might get covid 100 might die (1% fatality rate according calculation). 

In vaccinated group 100 people might get covid 1 might die (1% fatality rate according calculation). 

So see flawed fatality rate might think working compare two see chance dying dramatically lowered get vaccinated. Yes, According CBS article.

5 1million AZ
4 1million pfizer
And whopping 39 1million covid itself. 

These rare brain blood clot. try reserve opinion till analysis comes out. even correct mrna issue still massively better take vaccine. 

Will withhold judgement till analysis done. couple things:

1) 100% literally impossibile statistically. result obtained ""small"" contained trial. real world close 100%. people weak immune systems little sadly. also true vaccines, 100% possible. 

2) can't compare mortality like also controlled trials estimate efficacy vaccine. Why? assuming number people got covid first place vaccinated non vaccinated population. 

Let's say 1 milione people non vaccinated 1 milione people fully vaccinated. 

In non vaccinated group 10'000 people might get covid 100 might die (1% fatality rate according calculation). 

In vaccinated group 100 people might get covid 1 might die (1% fatality rate according calculation). 

So see flawed fatality rate might think working compare two see chance dying dramatically lowered get vaccinated. many people passed away covid previous years?

Or denying excess deaths? simple. two populations identical. Whatever makes vaccine less effective recipient may also make susceptible covid, looking potentially vulnerable population versus general one. Please correct I'm wrong, study showing vaccines equal chance ONE conditions (the clotting) addressing second condition complicates things?

No, study referring rarer Cerebral Venous Thrombosis incidence, rather clotting general signal investigated AZ J&amp;J

Quote Laboratory test results, available subset COVID-19 patients, provide preliminary evidence suggestive raised D-dimer, lowered fibrinogen, increased rate thrombocytopenia (low platelets) CVT PVT groups. Mortality 20% 18.8% respectively. data show incidence of CVT significantly increased COVID-19, greater observed BNT162b2 mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccines. risk CVT following COVID-19 also higher latest estimate European Medicines Agency incidence associated ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine (5.0 per million people, 95% CI 4.3–5.8). Although requiring replication corroboration, present data highlight risk serious thrombotic events COVID-19, help contextualizethe risks benefits vaccination regard. That's assuming independent variables. could connected. likely severe disease anyways may likely catch COVID despite vaccine. could people weak immune response COVID vaccine build immunity, would also weak immune response real COVID gotten really sick/died. metric, could argue anything, vaccine saving people would definitely died without it, juat saving everyone. seem assuming get covid. 

They still drew conclusion “There’s doubt Covid much greater risk [condition] vaccines,” said Professor Paul Harrison, co-author study » actual numbers article, it’s hard check  2-3 weeks start seeing articles “Millions J&amp;J vaccines sitting unused public remains cautious” real shame. Everyone reddit defaults “sTaY LaNe &amp; tRuSt tEh ExPerTs!!1!” think experts seriously overestimating public’s ability look past bad headlines. 

At end “pause”, even resume it, damage already done, good reason. 

You dont need scientist know delaying millions vaccinations scaring public 1 million blod clot terrible idea. mean, NH never really got hit hard begin with. surprising see this. wonder majority cases Nashuha Salem. NH cities location...by license plate visualization, could argue still MA. (If remember correctly) Obama co. change rules credit collecting medical bills don’t show up. think US smart enough that? Israel best airport security world interview passengers. Instead still TSA thing costs billions shit keep us safe. US way baby! You’re right; issue isn’t supply alternatives, it’s percentage population. Something like 20-30% adult population say won’t get vaccine ever. 

Not sure guys facing, that’s bad us. Vaccine rollout great here, can’t vaccinate refuse it. Hopefully experience people know, though talked least one person recovered covid felt awful couple days shot. person got Moderna shot, one me. hope best prepare worst. failure part local health departments publicized facts. Exactly. “No one ever get sick” isn’t goal; that’s impossible unreasonable. They’re exactly they’re supposed do. positive? Stop lying! Stop lying! one getting covid extremely small. them? Stop fucking lying! Thank condition, CDC discussed yesterday. Thanks! Even could count fucks give that.

Zero.

Its zero. got mine county government didn’t ask info afraid virus clearly killed people wanted now? Darwin’s cure. CDC advisory panel meeting yesterday focused idea incidence rate is, due delay appearing people known look for/report it. They're expecting more. sound scientifically accurate really issue wrong locations. could get IV leg let mistake. would still work.

To degree, felt like reaction seems stem sort antibodies body creates encounters spike proteins, heard blood clots issue covid, reaction could product people's immune response antibody, regardless got (vaccine/virus).

If really case, figured we'd see incidences every vaccine group, seem REALLY case. However recent news alluded fact actually might happening every vaccine group, different degrees. 

What people's thoughts, way base here? Well america's history, totally reasonable assume charging it. really way know sure individual cases. average people vaccinated mild illness though may actually still better never vaccinated. 5 million AZ, saying that's background expectation anyway. what's problem AZ? 4 million expectation 1 extra case per million causing concern? mean, time know. Studies come showing covid particles could live various surface days, even weeks. People concerned. There's nothing wrong serious news show running serious piece informing concerned listeners facts brand-new global pandemic. kind like going SPF 25 100 sunblock. Unless laying naked middle dessert day probably matter. guess statistically potentially benefit. people either feel better make statement.

I seen people grocery store masks, gloves, big plastic shield around head, etc. None recommended hey fly caution flag. got shot, easy literally begging get touch anyone wants shot, appointment needed, many. Thanks correction! ready side effects due ridiculous number posts seeing them, I've doses Pfizer now, absolutely side effects sore arm, anti climactic. yeah totally depends person. Btw that's also efficacy calculated. 

In trials efficacy calculated compared non vaccinated group represent chance getting infected exposed virus. Millions taken it, trials starting around year ago. dangerous would know now. serious adverse effects types vaccines past, show within weeks lead vaccines withdrawn market. Look serious treat AstraZeneca blood clots. give unsafe products. 

There reason vaccine suddenly side effects shows several months years taking it. left antibodies immune cells. would also covid, covid kill you. thing left see vaccine long lasts. hope nothing wrote gave impression vaccine working. would misinterpretation, due knowing infection fatality rates defined.

The infection fatality rate two groups indeed same. That's nonsense; important result. claimed vaccines reduce chances infected, also reduce severity disease chances death infected. that, important know. 

A better criticism post infection fatality rate depends age. much higher people 80. know age breakdown vaccinated group, although article say 40% infections 60. there's hope fatality rate representative general population, actual rate general population better.

Such claimed, looking confirmation articles like this, I've found yet. Yeah, political move really helpful, even though needed all. Thanks. know totally depends person, makes feel bit better. supposed get J&amp;J today originally glad didn’t lol Specificity administering shot though, right? understanding shot paid government regardless insurance reimburse cost nurse/etc administer it. Ironically would great news vaccine rollout, vaccine vs AZ easy win AZ, problem clearly safer vaccine available like mRNA vaccines. demonstrated issue would back full steam ahead vaccines don’t know detailed treatments reddit..also cdc fda review making final treatment recommendation. review started yesterday said days it’s done lump (See username) like 95% people walking outside wear mask. wearing one likeg oing underwear point. necessarily agree, thats here. absolutely idea long term dangers covid children it’s 1 year since disease around. I’m glad think fears child developing long term respiratory problems unreasonable, neither many parents care think. want kids expose disease, go right ahead. also, would individual decision, would almost risk herd immunity present (infecting unlikely) take AZ could cause blood clots Deaths COVID take long time get official stats though. Around 5 weeks infection reported. 

So takes 5-6 weeks get fully vaccinated, another 5 weeks catch reported, talking nearly many potential candidates fully vaccinated/dead would seem. 

And that's even counting people get infected first day fully vaccinated. 

This big delay probably makes vaccinated/death number lower reality vaccine prevents. 

Now, said, factors working direction well, earliest vaccines going older people. idk ""real"" answer is, vaccine clearly helps quite bit. thank answer, surprised people downvoting question. 

So think people got admitted full vaccination bad luck would worse vaccinated first place? That's 77 million people means getting shot (in primarily high risk population mind you) chances dying covid like 0.00001% time period.

It continue go population vaccinated people starts resemble whole country subsequent decrease overall case numbers. Seems individual response. 

After first shot little tired night tightness / stiffness legs. Shoulder little sore. fever. headache. Within 24 hours felt good. 

Second shot, reaction expecting done 24-48 hrs. EXACTLY chancellor 4 periods, current polls show CDU (her party) might lose election candidate isn’t popular saying takes weeks vaccines provide immunity pretending people getting vaccinated? world make sense? came hoping post this... take upvote beautiful stranger! *is* fully covered. pay dime it. ask insurance medical record purposes bill insurance company.

The actual vaccine costs something like $28-$34 (you find CMS website). administration costs $0.10. 

They bill insurance company iirc. don’t think people getting hesitant COVID vaccines general. problem time lost, every day wait around hundreds deaths billions lost lockdowns. rediculous part stop, wait days, come conclusion whatever side effects benefits still higher risks green light resume administrations. Repeat process over. Yeah guy changes mind every week. “Would rather get stroke covid AZ?” everybody surges re-surges something especially noteworthy. We're bad situation honest.

Dont see benefit overly oppressive lockdows? Right there's perception vaccines better others, however even two paused vaccines would probably net benefit world everyone got today. Yes risks, question whether people die covid result vaccinations postponed waiting increased supply ""better ones"". envy experts make calculation trying figure people get blood clots vaccines. month since Novavax published Phase III results yet haven’t applied authorization MHRA. really much concern AZ backed govts abundance caution. Even small issue like see blown like crazy.

Also worth noting although incidence 6 6 million, know clotting issues appears certain demo - women birth control medication (and therefore younger pre-menopausal). Another complication birth control medication rarely cause blood clots *on own* vaccine might even relevant anyway.

But point incidence 6 6 million, higher demo 6 issues occurred. long coronavirus remain viable air? find information states virus remains air 3 hours, sounds like virus settles onto surface 3 hours, become non-viable. kind stuff turned Facebook Reddit.

Could also variant. Yeah. #CannotRelate really misleading post title.

Here actual headline:

""With Johnson &amp; Johnson’s vaccine pause, consequences could ripple worldwide.""

OP pretty irresponsible, imo. mean taxpayer funded You’re right, many kids went back sooner, bad. accurately, kids didn’t benefit online learning. millions kids haven’t attended day school, attend virtual sessions didn’t get much them.

Plus holdout districts really best effort fucking students.

Maybe it’s slightly, slightly better nothing all. studies shown longer virtual school, less get it, don’t get anything weeks. works unlikely show difference variants. interaction virus particle like hammer vaccine, time determine whether slight mutation spike protein...smash smash smash everything (note: scientific terminology function). Right ok. Apologies. thinking it’s real shame people put vaccines arguably over-cautious governments’ positions. Immunity generally expire one day, usually gradually declines many months even years decades. example, people vaccinated 1976 swine flu still better protected 2009 swine flu. 

The vaccines perfect always chance infected post vaccination average know chances significantly reduced. Idiots making stupid statements.  thank god, 3 year old quarantine 2nd time, 3 kids tested positive day care class looking parents really isnt wonder. thankfully mine negative, entire daycare close, stay home, ergo loose wages 10 days again...just ppl think cares children get not. vaccine cant come fast enough people seem miss point:

Nobody would voluntarily infect Covid. vaccine ofc much better Covid infection. Nodody ever claimed otherwise.

But depending live do, yor risk getting covid infection in, say, next 6 month might rather low.

Now, AZ would Vaccine is, since would get Covid sooner later, ofc get AZ vaccine asap.

But could get another vaccine, like Pfizer/Biontech, say 1-2 months later? Would still take AZ right away? Depending age risk infection *might* actually better didt. No, need vaccinate people, become authoritarian state again. thats sad can’t justify locking prevent 10-20 deaths per day population 10 million. economical mental health consequences massively outweigh whatever benefit 10-20 people would bring point. We’re talking excess mortality 3-6% currently stands. daily death toll decrease risk groups vaccinated within next 2 months so. point won’t deaths. 

The moral calculus favours staying open current excess mortality.  you’re likely hit lightning get blood clot vaccine. Nice!! Better keep job! thread year ago [US testing capacity still abysmal, labs US could handle around 100k tests per daily deaths around 2500 though, knew massively undertesting purely daily death count.

If makes sick rightly fucked liability immunity one gonna pay you. pauzing astrazeneca vaccinations dumb. lots important info missing, many unvaccinated people similar situations got infected time. 

Remember, people get COVID months time even without vaccine. Anyplace country heavily using AZ much stock mrna vaccines. may lead months+ waiting leaving higher risk covid. Ok posted elsewhere? title article article saying. title misleading.  understanding, longer gap better. take second dose higher chance get infected aka doctors. information drives going on?

Im pretty sure plenty rather vaccine catch covid number likely includes car accidents though victim caused himself/herself driving way fast, drunk, drugged, ignoring red light, etc. bet probability daying car accident lower exclude victims kind caused death extreme carelessness. “Wait, guys tracking?”

USA rest world. Reported Seems like it. whole Europe reach herd immunity July far plans go. I'm pro-vaccines think vaccine used, get argument.

People choosing injecting vaccine injecting COVID. apples apples comparison; factor risk COVID causing blood clot *and* risk getting COVID first place. case, risk catching COVID would 1/8; tell total infection rate USA 1/10 someone who's taking precautions like masking distancing, almost certainly even less.

Just accept there's slightly elevated risk blood clots vaccine people's cases, *overall* benefits (both personal health reaching herd immunity life go back normal) outweigh risk, anyone who's worried conversation doctor personal risk level. protecting vaccinating population around them. That’s effective seatbelt give get vaccinations approved age bracket. Masks effective, yes, way children wear (I literally never seen child wear well fitting mask), adverse effects developing children missing social cues able read lips hard hearing might underestimated. reach certain threshold infection general population, need reevaluate restrictions safety measures. says won’t get point fall? situation ""dramatic"" number people hospitalized intensive care far December?

Honestly, sometimes looks like German doctors politicians way cautious pretty much every country Europe comes dealing covid. Figures cases, hospitalizations deaths consistently lower comparable countries, yet whole health care system seems constantly warning impending collapse politicians act like they're see dead bodies pile streets.

I mean, saying they're wrong overly cautious, said certainly behaviour paid given overall stats, still interesting see. Still, worrying mrna vaccines. Schools aren’t “closed.” majority open person learning.

Yup! Someone correct I'm wrong feel like using percentage kind misleading. sort assumes 75 million people would've gotten COVID vaccinated. mean 138 million COVID cases world total (that know of) would weird say 138 million/7.8 billion 1.77% people gotten COVID (most vaccinated).

There's tradeoffs sides things. doesn’t “not work 5% cases.” reduces risk 95 percent whatever number is. That’s completely different. I'm type 1 diabetic get really nervous Im getting blood drawn can't look needle going in. stab like 10x day sharp stuff... thing somebody first dose, 2nd dose basically given within week timeframe (barring person showing 2nd dose). first dose metric much useful figure many people getting vaccinated. 2nd dose metric lags month behind.

I agree logic keep safer vaccine can, going try great, post Internet wholey irresponsible. It’s free? think thing ""unofficially"" country Memorial day Im going indoor jazz san francisco tomorrow. Indoor live music starts California Also people know find appointments. state go .gov site make appointment vaccine. Nothing change. There's cases like that, someone testing positive months arrive. 


I live Taiwan COVID here. Life normal. running around undetected/unreported, people would know.. put test picking faint traces still body rather catching Taiwan. allowed that. say “I don’t insurance,” still schedule vaccine appointment. Around definitely book. hope call whomever’s charge neck woods let that’s legal respect vaccine. reserved slot vaccine, asked insurance type, went free.

Why ask free? Agh. Stahp. narrowing demographic more. 

Yeah, keeping close eye case. almost timeframe anyway just. . . Yeesh I'm tired worrying shit. like want pandemic never end. Even basic labs tend lead random bills month later. last labs cost $95 ordered routine physical. I'd surprised bill already surprised bill daughter blood drawn couple years ago. Makes ""free"" appointment free though.

You always decide tests though. really anything doctor tries get do. Doctors like pressure stuff, usually good, can't *make* anything. also get impression they're usually overcautious they'd rather miss something, they're probably really thinking who's paying it. people got it, got antibodies?... would need vaccine already antibodies?... pay premium every month might well make fuckers pay instead adding national debt point healthcare provide healthcare creating group disadvantaged people even hurting goes basic ethics. state callously means value perceived fairness ability people get actual help. less “so long one suffering must suffer”. basically admit universal care garbage. honest that's really fair comparison, since US system fucked up. Let's look Germany instead. Germany choose public private insurance. young healthy private insurance cheaper provides better care. get older private insurance becomes expensive, much pay public insurance always depends income.
So yes, public insurance, earning good salary, healthy, paying much paying subsidizing other's health care. socialized health care many people end paying cover costs can't. think that's great way.   Fauci saying, though? mid twenties Jamaican, got vaccinated Monday don’t think hipaa cover that. 

HIPAA prevents medical providers telling others. employer places demand provide medical proof them, like drug test vaccine. Another alternative plain walking shopping mall. totally closed lockdowns, opened back state. mask on, pretty easy stay distanced everyone. That’s real concern. know company joined others hired remotes pandemic plans making us come office, lot people work office absolutely coming back like working home. 

There like 17% total office workforce looking forward going back in. right tell companies wasting lot money owning office space. mean, isn’t job? don’t listen course; obviously people pandemic. concern continued loss life. silent recommendations, she’d failing uphold job responsibilities   anything sore arm, got pfizer 2 monday. day yesterday felt crummy. Today headache lethargic. grandmother (who already high-risk) already is. covid denier says mother friend her's life support getting second dose. clue information accurate, definitively decided never getting vaccine now. mean planning getting before, announce soapbox. Particularly POC purposely deceived events like Tuskegee syphilis study black people given disease monitored without medical intervention. increase informational ads get people take it.

Already seeing them. good. Saying vaccine safe going lose public support covid vaccines general same. Taiwan, 30k 600k eligible first shot taken it--AZ.

The media lot answer fear-mongoring failing assure people risks minimal. Yeah, let people know there's blood clot risk, sure, fair. media have, large, failed point there's risk hit car getting blood clot.

&amp;#x200B;

It's par course, though. media disgrace throughout. remember caused panic buying plastering pictures handful empty shelves front pages. doctor anything reports blood clots J&amp;J vaccine 6-13 days vaccine. 5 weeks later, according this, fine. Fucking hell blows. I'm getting second Pfizer shot next week. imagine waiting another 6 months.  Don’t help places like CVS Walgreens give impression it’s requesting insurance. Question: guys think attitude shift ""this deadly disease, contain it"" "" assume risk, wanna die bad"" us getting point supply demand  That’s hilarious. Welcome socialized medicine. beautiful? Sit back donut :) It’s stored centrally, federal level, way app could reach it. That’s places like ALCU advocating far accessible plan governments take route like this. someone would rather stay inside couple months instead taking AZ vaccine, also rethink whether they'd want go pandemic over.

I've got steady remote work lots solo hobbies. hard staying home, months gets vaccine slightly less risk, I? like anything gonna open enjoy next months anyways. mean... it’s B-cells well Yes trade-offs. 

Universal healthcare still obviously better societal level.

There going group people disadvantaged even hurt proposed reform. Pointing isn’t argument proposed reform 2nd shot noon yesterday. feel asleep hard around 4 pm 2 hours. woke morning feeling like hangover. migraine got worse took 2 Advil afternoon feel pretty much fine. arm still pretty sore. close decade still get stories goddamned Malaysian plane. like five decades five years. it? numbers running get significance there?  relevant poll would ask haven’t vaccinated yet. One Thermometer put forehead. That’s pre-work screenings but...the gene therapy 😂 😂 😂  charge insurance administration costs. still get don’t think difference know *why* happen contraception. know blood clots happen AZ why. denying CDC results? Airlines already hygienic enough? think good point, lots preventative healthcare advertised free like annual physicals. However doctor may order tests talk things preventative physical longer free. Likewise colonoscopy 50 free unless find something.

This big problem healthcare leads avoiding doctors get ER. europe highly unlikely normal year? Wanted go yacht week year Croatia Floridian kids school, I'm happy mask mandates year I'm thrilled next year. point kids deserve true normalcy. recoup administrative costs understanding. Anyone insured, eat cost, pass something insurance will. 

But 100% agree creates unintentional perceived barrier. Actually topic vaccine waiver forms it’s pretty straight forward one answer. can’t vaccines within 14 days either direction covid vaccine. Reason? Got mine morning. Can’t wait 6 weeks Well sow oats plants rise. Yup. need 14 days vaccines. According official numbers, yeah. numbers represent fraction true infection count, especially poorer nation like India. 

Not saying what’s happening India isn’t horrific, would continue go quite didn’t vaccine campaign underway. what’s point making scary estimates based numbers know fact inaccurate? Go local pharmacy. Much easier less traffic. central system chain pharmacies, urgent clinics, FEMA separate system needs metrics place happen try encourage people get vaccinated. happen given let us say...privileges ~~advertising~~ prescribing you? He/she saying people forget cancel appointment means someone else can’t get day/time. pushes people would first person cancelled. Honestly: wouldn’t. already good amount immunity one shot. It’s worth risk another shot gives another 5% immunity. US sure. world Pfizer vaccines grow fucking trees, AZ whatever scraps Pfizer US willing send us (practically nothing) grinding whole vaccination program halt they're available delay minimum 6+ months lucky countries even ones queue. think it’s women hormonal birth control specifically. It’s still pretty small number it’s hard worry. Best thing know symptoms call dr soon experiences them. happens like 13 days vaccinations something.

I watched dr John Campbell YouTube morning. info. Thanks response. issue second doses? two dose vaxxes USA, make appointment second dose, you’re getting first. It’s 3 weeks separation, those. guess we’re lucky it’s rolled out? center seats left empty, airlines need fly flights, pilots full employment. supply meet demand, airlines raise prices. much tax money went bail airlines?  think airlines owe country lot bailout. least help end pandemic sooner keep center seat empty. Reducing Covid exposure flights big win country. you’d better report immediately businesses still mask mandate. statewide mask mandate grocery stores, Target, etc still require them. enforced sign people comply. I'm wondering businesses stop requesting them. banned shown huge disease vector. thing. overwhelming majority restaurants can't filled 100% capacity everyone consistently six feet apart. know I'm steering clear AstraZeneca. missed news JnJ issues blood clotting too? People don’t realize net cost system would likely lower everyone access medical care. think costs more? Proving preventive care someone get really sick, ambulance ride, ER visit, hospital stay something could’ve prevented?

And idiots say “well don’t think pay peoples care!” 1. You’re monster 2. think costs people can’t pay get passed to? know, people racking huge bills eventually get really sick rather cost occasional trip doctor antibiotic.

That people wear “don’t take ambulance” bracelets would literally bankrupt disgusting makes ashamed country allowing persist. give opportunity bill government buttttt insurance bill lol guess know trade works underdeveloped countries developed ones Vaccines end. Good thing US fairly open, need push masks vaccinations. vaccine prevent catching covid entirely? understanding still might possible spread it, makes statement true regardless whether 40 woman gets vaccinated. mean entirely possible mRNA vaccines any... possible plausible complications. Congestion less common COVID loss smell consistent respiratory viruses cause congestion. test would way sure though. tests check flu time I'm sure arrange that. Someone understand Bayesian thinking! They’re closed Montreal third new cases caused schools clearly they’re safe enough Agreed wonder far private businesses take new found freedoms. far willing discriminate eyes?

While may work, see unintended consequences like shoving certain voting blocs stores across america. Like say based voted making sign waiver (gun store michigan already (at least making say vote joe biden)) wiped significant portion population caused average life expectancy drop 12 years Yes. HIPAA cover that. 

You might run problem employer decides require everyone get vaccine. vaccine cards date them. though 2 weeks first shot Pfizer... mean consult doctor sort thing. told take vaccine fair enough. making medical decisions based 'what think right' need get head arse go see doctor. No, they're brown! Send first world country!!! /s article 

That means governors must weigh public would willing consider respond resurgence cases fueled new variants. 


Basically affect re-election bid. That's true though, commanded air circulation studies schools (albeit late), mandatory surgical mask, one day two remote high school, class bubbles they're closed red zones.  date, believe oldest case thrombosis-thrombocytopenia
reported 54, median age 30 something. seems younger immune systems likely over-react older people's immune systems, even young risk low, elderly seems effectively zero. UK vaccinated literally millions elderly find cases 60+ age group. grandma fine. still 37% category no, forced, hesitant. 

That way big yet get herd immunity numbers. Bee stings kill way people first injection per year. Ban bees immediately. makes sense waiting amount time it’s going take issue show majority people got shot (since rolled larger scale last week), person demographic group got vaccine going long two weeks. worked hybrid schedule since March 2020, 3 days remote 2 office. 2 remote 3 office. boss said permanent I’m satisfied! time! thing happened mum despite health conditions. told nothing vaccine, wonder scale problem underestimated.  chaos, lot people die result this. 


It global consequences. see large parts global south shun AZ/J&amp;J vaccine hesitancy induced western health officials making decisions western audiences, take far longer vaccinate said populations means direct death covid countries also increases chance new mutations appearing may undermine western world well. 


I think costs suspending vaccine really quite under-estimated regulators, much far reaching may expect. Atleast circle sadly does. complete corona deniers since started, going anti-vax agenda definetely isnt helping all. dont get see 1-3% chance death like total joke doesnt exist, 1 40000? chance issues biggest terror is. sure that. Majority us country got first dose Astra Zeneca history covid infection (regular RT-PCR ECLIA monitoring), yet experienced severe side effects chills, fever, malaise, anorexia/nausea body pains. think nature vaccine adenoviral vector. free tests offices. link what? Pfizer denies finding stated article. interesting see “right”.

Oxford much skin game trust peer reviewed. Finally eligible WA scheduled first shot Pfizer Wednesday!! excited done mean, everyone got measles shots anti vaxxers, rather huge portion population. got rid measles 2000 US. made resurgence. say number needed herd immunity, they're pretty accurate. say need 70%, 50% population gets shots, that's 170 million people still unvaccinated, spread Covid. Plenty get flu shots every year, flus still around. Even good years shot 60% effective. aren’t close thing. Also, masks aren’t norm belts are, people want go back norm. Hiding behind mask never preferred method. People helps right now, people want with. still find funny run across people make fantasies. [this site lot collections covid community scientists experts field

crazy people look science facts Maybe, still two really good vaccines people fence going find excuse could convince vaccinated Agreed. everyone acting like cousin Dennis created vaccine really needs money? I’m disagreeing. weird necessary last-step restriction removal since wearing one doesn’t affect economic output (as opposed keeping stuff closed mask mandates lifted). vaccines, doesn’t hold up. risk alternatives cause blood clots? Yes!!! Whoosh lol Yup, logic sound.
Ignore idiots Sure yeah, he's MD, PhD read yes. mRNA vaccines simply best far.  optional everyone. opt out, deserve get rewarded getting use PTO. Makes sense me. also benefit high uptake percentage time said done. 

Canadians like complain provincial health care, *trust* it.  context global pandemic scarcity vaccines, get giving choice, may enough vaccines give it. refusing tell people they're going get? reeks paternalism me, disgrace democratic countries kind thing. 645,412 recorded Covid deaths EU+EEA (combined population roughly 453 million). 3 weeks made think pfizer vaccine could wrong. far mRNA vaccines proven effective every variant currently circulation. Boosters already development. Vaccine escape something panic moment. clue science academics work you? mean vaccines available.... AstraZeneca given low clot risk.. CBS changed title. read article One year yes, one also uncertain given ""scary"" news everlasting emergence variants, surprised shit continue indefinitely. think choosing ""pause"" ""safety concerns"" terrible unforced error authorities.  already concerned people refusing delaying vaccination planning J&amp;J ""underserved"" demographics something confirms people's suspicion vaccines proven safe J&amp;J vaccine somehow inferior Pfizer Moderna... Denmark Norway projects death using AstraZeneca using it. due low death rates virus, increasing supply mRNA vaccines slow deliveries AstraZeneca. countries higher death rates less access mRNA vaccines becomes entirely different calculation. three months? shortage Pfizer one? got I'm worried follow 21 days. husband still talk movie. Completely forgotten time.  meeting district laboratories Maharashtra last week, National Institute Virology (NIV) shared limited data showing break-up 361 genome-sequenced samples collected January March year.
The headline finding from the analysis: presence double mutation detected 220 — almost 61 per cent — samples. double variant last week classified “B.1.617” variant. VACCINE SAFE QUESTION GOVERNMENT CARRY Significant numbers? know qualifies significant numbers. 

However, speak community pastor. service year high vaccination rate among people already. said, probably 15-20% congregation said would attend service masks mandated September. 

To me, that's significant number think largely due increased anxiety stress trauma past year. 

I consider responsible throughout pandemic, however point private service (for people church) think I'd require masks. Encourage? Sure. reality 80+% vaccination + Covid + cleaning/distancing protocols place make think extremely low risk. 

Regardless, 15-20% church, low risk enough. want ""no risk"" article Danish news site nyheder.tv2.dk right now, government considering this.

Edit: chances getting blood clot vaccine roughly 1 1,000,000. need work risk hospitalised/dying caught covid first place. 30 risk happening slightly lower vaccine, 30 rises pretty quickly also like first activity occurring months. Spring 2020 pretty strict lockdowns, June protests happened know lot people went protests simply something house... sounds awful city protests riots safe, large social gatherings, people cooped bored wanted house. Like cities protests hosted mayor etc., definitely viewed protest/community event kind thing lot people. 🤷‍♀️  ridiculous take. Wow. ever met anyone liked wearing seat belts? Again, mild inconvenience even worst case scenario. get ""I refuse mildly inconvenienced reason"" thing. Safe relative term. 

Without vaccines, good chance son safe. 

Unvaccinated children may well significantly lower risk fully vaccinated older adults. 

Add fact vaccinated people visiting likely natural immunity personally would find situation safe. 

But always level risk. comment told getting Pfizer vaccine. little 50% 2 weeks initial dose 95% 2 weeks last dose. May accurate told literally sitting getting injected. give two doses vaccine. isn’t part Part B. It’s one injected twice month apart. Oh okay, know actually something 1000 number making point Thanks you! study mRNA shots came conclusion even get 1 shot offers protection J&amp;J does? Plus, people anything immune response reaction second shot. Plus really seem streamlined shots well. I've different sites taking family, friends 20 minutes. waiting period longest part whole process. Drink lots water stay hydrated many shot someone take year stay date? strong evidence covid become endemic, similar flu. [Nature One key factor understand although J&amp;J AZ less effective, they’re effective preventing serious illness others. Given it’s high probability become endemic virus like flu won’t really ever go away, isn’t best protect population serious illness/death? I’ve gathered I’ve read please let know there’s better approach haven’t found great article/source explaining angles mention. Thanks. absolutely right, addressing underlying problem here. real problem everybody knows this, situation intentionally made profoundly political, general mental reaction topic vaccines turns to, ""ugh, everyone talks politics."" like climate change. 

The fundamental issue modern political discourse clouded dishonesty, ignorance. Would rather look percentage world population died covid maybe state county? Bet nickle higher vaccines chance hurting you. also get part population go around spreading pestilence, sound nice? killing people :) vaccine basically dummed version virus? would explain similiar-symptoms gives risk clots develop think thing makes non-issue rate occurrence statistically insignificant, mean direct interpretation term. last figure saw/heard six individuals identified blood clots could attributed vaccine, 7 million people vaccinated it. puts rate incidence 0.00009%. Honestly, think took much risk, more, crossed street morning get work car. get whole “minimizing risk” argument, one category things lower-risk activities average person already chooses voluntarily assumption relative safety, like crossing street, driving work, even spending afternoon sun (12.7 cases melanoma per 100,000 people, 0.0127% chance; 141 times likely vaccine-related blood clot).

Yes, there’s “chance”. it’s good odds winning lottery; maybe even less (depending one play). Anybody reading toilet probably higher risk health due sitting bad posture would getting clot vaccination.  I'm place P1 variant taken hold, would likely able get vaccinated early June. news see mix optimism vaccine rollout (particularly United States) pessimism spread P1, B1351, B117 could overwhelm hospitals. I've fortunate enough work home, I'm much worried contracting Covid virus mutate point current vaccines almost become moot we're back last year.

How everyone feel world vaccine vs variant race? much seen social media legitimate concern much excessive alarmism? Reddit nutshell. 
This website fucking garbage honest. 
The whole “Reddit hive mind” joke quite literally made edgy stay home low income losers. suggestion? Pick date, stick it. June 15th, don’t know. Far enough away appeases overly risk averse, must stuck to. Regardless happens, June 15th, masks longer mandates, social distancing, 100% capacity everywhere. Covid over, June 15th. something like that.

I believe someone high profile position tried last year, failed miserably. course, prior vaccine rollouts.

Whatever date chosen use metrics-based approach arbitrarily picked. Lmao! know free. want 🤷‍♂️ formed course prophylaxis Got Pfizer 2 yesterday. I’m definitely feeling off-not bed bound, little hazy, tired, mild motion sickness stand walk around.

Wondering go work afternoon stay home case gets worse. answer without medical degree.

Everyone get vaccine regardless maker.

Everything else fucking bullshit hamster wheel powered brain idiot know viruses worked first place.

The correct response ""Get shot"" Congrats! honestly harder time far first shot second, shots easier covid last October. Hopefully everyone that’s holding go get stuck move nightmare. flip side, older age groups prone greater risks severe outcomes vaccinated, reducing risk younger age group pools greater population gets vaccinated. younger people, may never make sense take vaccines present risk blood clotting. Variants continue resurface causing localized outbreaks, unlike flu.

Two weeks Easter. seems trend infection numbers spiking weeks gathering-oriented holidays. wear masks it’s asked doubt majority people *like* wearing masks, that’s don’t. It’s complicated.

Amigo, não. ones metal nose bending? N95s yes fingers crossed! 

Overall vaccine hesitancy keeps slowly drifting (even J&amp;J pause), 80% adults vaxed possibility mid June. actually incentivized people actually get vaccine. 

The next stimulus check (if ever get one) 100% tied vaccinated. Thanks people come shit? Lol. Sorry downvotes--it's probably part lot people throwing bad-faith arguments here. often hard tell apart people genuine concerns.

Edit: point--the vaccines older that. Moderna entered rigorous clinical trials March *2020*. mRNA technology, used Pfizer Moderna, development since 1990s. applies here. Small sample size medical professionals. That's completely different demographic comped 1.000.000 general public never fully recover it. vomitting nausea took 3-4 days subside 2-3 weeks completely disappear, sense balance never same. avid runner run balance kind weird times. thing even happens sometimes walk. improved exponentially 2 1/2 months since initial vertigo bout, probably going marginally effected rest life. top 100% deaf left ear.

Man vax disinformation campaign strong. CSVT rare type blood clot occurs veins near brain. don’t one urgent care told screw off, different words basically Norwegian public health institute recommends dropping AstraZeneca vaccine. Politicians may discuss possibility offering volunteers, looks like AZ, possibly J&amp;J, dead Norway.

Our infection rate low enough risk catching Covid dying seems considerably less risk dying vaccine complications. estimate woman 40s wait \~1.5 *years* taking AZ vaccine theoretically better waiting. likely wait long supply alternative vaccines. 

Overall, AstraZeneca complete mess, selling Gates foundation (mostly fucking poor countries), opaque production difficulties contract breaches, dangerous complications flagged clinical trials.  u get flu started getting flu vaccine? scientists code reporters/media prey fear anxiety?

in upper 20s male underlying conditions Thank you. wants go back work hes permanently retired. 66, job since 8 yrs old (milking cows dairy). really 10k saying can't cover anymore say amount people died acknowledge it. 2-tier society- idiots non-idiots.  hear ya, do. hope keep safe; wish could help anxiety, really do.  


All best can, right?   


P.S. Judging downvotes, people REALLY like hearing truth, eh? smh Willful ignorance reality truth seems way death far many us around world. :( pissed testing. testing center lied telling going free, asked insurance company ended charging me. free give me? strict distinction medical use term ""airborne"" literal meaning term ""airborne"". droplet airborne, whatever inside also airborne; that's used medical terms, understand correctly. BC?  know already, 16% cause blood clot, AstraZeneca less 0.4% blood clot scare forgotten millions billions people poor countries get vaccine grateful it.

Oh no, that’s anything works. wealthier countries make J&amp;J AZ export only, nobody ever forgetting blood clotting getting away saying “I thought they’d grateful.”

Put shoes someone developing world 10 years different vaccines rich countries poor countries side effect developing world extreme difficulty treating 

You may westerners continuing say “they grateful” stirring resentment

The possible moral solutions are:

1.	Identify at-risk groups adenovirus-vector vaccines certain they’re given alternative vaccines barring people. (Do *not* say “at age group, risk COVID outweighs risk side effects. still argument giving vaccines that’s case, give vaccines.) may require ramp-up mRNA vaccine tech bringing freezers developing world using infrastructure excuse
2.	Stopping use adenovirus vector vaccines altogether *including* export. would also necessarily require developing medical infrastructure developing world making freezers mRNA vaccines part deal you’re considering shortly many people going declare pandemic everyone resume normal activities. point don’t know infection rate unvaccinated. Maybe everyone unvaccinated eventually get it. case odds blood clots much better vaccine.  case boosters needed? still high efficacy 6 months reason believe would dwindle longer periods? don’t anger hive mind, mods, even look wrong subreddit, even disagree it. There’s nice table break related chances dying. add big takeaway: “What end risk dying COVID-19 anywhere 36 78,571 times HIGHER risk dying J&amp;J vaccine-related blood clot.” People become anti anti-vaccers site they've gone opposite extreme become pro-vaccine zealots ignore expert advice testimony contrary. fear many superior anti-vaccers scientific truth. Awareness Method empowers women.

Reading *Taking Charge Fertility was* eye opening me. read till starting think kid, wish read teenager.  probably still would pill college nowhere near responsible enough FAM correctly, wish knowledge body works. entire lifetimes, government's responses massive quagmires goals end sight. 

* war Drugs: war drugs started 80's drug use prevalent ever: 

* war terror: started war Afghanistan fight Taliban. 20 years later, we're give country to, could guessed, Taliban. Also War terror: still take shoes airport 15 years one person tried smuggle one device one time. Keep mind TSA almost completely ineffective anything security theater Jobs program: 

* War obesity: started war obesity we're fatter nation ever before: 

I could keep going on, hopefully understand people skeptical caught next government quagmire permanent security theater. 4 deaths since started administering vaccines? correct? places USA it’s way easier get mrna repost, several problems title: study actually look AZ all, studies mRNA ones; number observed CVTs mRNA vaccines large error bars contradicts studies say number much lower; cannot used derive background rate rare blood clots correct age demographic factors given vaccines; address actual rare condition linked AZ J&amp;J CVT associated low platelets due auto-immune reaction.

That said, basic conclusion Covid much likely general cause CVT vaccine seems perfectly correct. P1 variant nightmare. see tearing communities reinfecting people Brazil. Opening soon going allow variants like spread US potentially set vaccination efforts back square one.  5 year old asked going got first dose, explain vaccine was. said ""I like shots, need one those!"" 

Some kids get too. You’re correct. think comparison made somewhere load confusion resulted. clinician probably said something someone media birth control pill also causing clots “similar” incidence rate without clarifying nature clots. someone else probably jumped “it’s interacting”. fact women men reaction also probably plays it. women reaction probably women vaccine eligible make younger health social care workforce. describing [disease herd immunity. intent even vaccines eradicate disease entirely, task enormous vaccine one tool process. 

The USA wide scale vaccination program foster herd immunity MMR (measles, mumps, rubella). course seasonal flu, although that's close comparison flu mutative. 

But none viruses eradicated USA even years years vaccinations population herd immunity. 

You seem mistaken [how herd immunity I'm sorry comments read came definition 'herd immunity' based two words, insist arguing definition medical fact. condescending boot. 

The truth right header article. immunity occurs majority population immune disease virus. Otherwise known community immunity, helps *slow spread* infectious diseases two ways

Achieving herd immunity eradicating virus monumentally different tasks. Humanity [has eradicated two infectious history, smallpox, rinderpest (a cattle disease). amazon.com e-commerce website allowed posts comments.

You making point. assume Pfizer data release it.

Both peer reviewed. best far, tell. I’m still waiting say “oh need 2 shots every 6 months” people start strange side effects bodies begin recognizing nanolipid encapsulation threat.

It happened 2016 stopped research. suddenly emerges miracle. I’ll take chances adenovirus vaccine problem, US given 6 million JJ vaccines 2 months since approval already detected 6 cases.

Pfizer Moderna approved four months administered 185 million shots, including 123 million first doses.

If similar rates clotting, seems highly unlikely none roughly 180 people would get identified yet. Yeah arguments there, long handle it. interesting see cases develop. past seemed every time outbreak loomed case numbers drop again. time breaching 1,000 rising wonder happen. Testing course big question spent much time looking data. know past lot testing targeted.  thinking Nick Cordero, RIP. feel bad wife. Intensive care units massively expanded personal staff doesnt fall sky. Tbf problem never really infrastructure like countries rather medical staff that’s kinda hard increase year. Yes, could would motives, dismissing academic study company disagrees make sense. studies, probably 100% independent ones. cars go 90. exactly zero business operate 100% capacity maintain social distancing. Zero. analogy, cars go 40. Not.just car, EVERY car. 


They two different restrictions. jist impact other. makes IMPOSSIBLE. Social distancing makes 100% capacity impossible, therefore social distancing allow 100% capacity. 100% capacity restriction lifted, used different restriction make 100% capacity impossible. restriction still there. Well know lots people worried the, know? Lmao say get sick without insurance financially ruined. done math this, number critical incidents (not death) AZ one 40.000 Danish health authorities. Covid related deaths dk say 1-2 daily moment. officials call control, better capable determine 'under control' means scenario, I'll take word it. 

But case fear vaccine issue, health officials saying currently needed. Fair enough read Danish, also say necessary permanent no. said, today seem considering giving poor nations Africa, case would permanent Danish use.

Personally care vaccine I'm given, understand people injured vaccine really need would feel differently, think also saying no.


Edit: typo I’m saying economically affect concert club venues far person would really turned mask mandate either two settings choice I'm Denmark stopped using altogether.

Not choice Sweden either yoy 65 understanding, vaccine fairly zero instance respiratory failure. People inherently selfish, nothing despicable take health seriously. assumption wrong, brazilian, Brazil one worst places covid right now. need vaccines would never tell someone ignore fears concerns UK wants use vaccines shows several issues disregard other’s desire proper information take. UK options, decided use one, chance wait, lot world waiting, according you, people reaction get screwed helping rest country get protected. sorry many wants causality Government disregard safety order speed economy. ways prevent covid without vaccine, many others vaccines, want take it, it. belittling someone wants information make decision may affect death despicable me. think pulling J&amp;J market opened lot people's eyes leaders exactly weighing various risks/benefits regarding COVID, rather weighing based something else entirely. anywhere 3 8 weeks first shot  Another comment said mandatory are. 

As PTO agree use PTO get sick, complaint. understand, give us PTO bank B can't even use thinks use Bank first. Since I'm guy good health, I've never used getting pregnant major surgeries. hve 300+ hours eve use. quit got even get paid Bank B, get Bank A.

Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* agree mass vaccination sites. They’re clean, efficient, you’ll 20 minutes. still want brain clot whatever caused odds. getting second moderna shot tomorrow. 45% republicans intend getting vaccinated. problem's bit concerning. Oh boy cannot wait I’m shocked Oxford would make statement Pfizer Moderna.

It works ways. need independent analysis. much skin game. difference antibodies getting covid vs vaccine. I've seen reports saying covid antibodies last around 90 days reports saying Pfizer vaccine effective least 6 months still understand people get preventative measures mean 100% never going catch virus. Unless live bubble never leave home always risk catching it. kids endpoint virus would you, it’s not. Kids get sick pass parents grandparents caregivers. might pass another kid immunocompromised. 

So I’m really worried kids getting seriously ill dying Covid. worry kid could vector make someone seriously ill kill others. believe responsibility look other, that’s something factors decisions this. charged $250 covid test ensured free, despite going skeptical asking numerous times “are sure free provider”?, despite thinking clear CARES act.

Nope, provider told later network, place got charging “administrative fees”. $250.

People reasonably skeptical get healthcare here. isn’t first time I’ve told I’m getting “free” service, middlemen find sort loophole put individual hook. 

I honestly scared I’ll charged $1000s dollars covid shots, even though insurance told won’t anything worry there. don’t much trust hospitals insurance thinking best interest, see $$$. No, primary mode transmission infection via droplets. also used 480,000 people study mRNA vaccine. Why? many doses mRNA vaccines administered.

Yet seem use much bigger number people AZ ratio.  like 15 minutes. 

There exceptions obviously mask helps with. Namely like someone spits via talking purposefully coughing sneezing. 

It’s risk management. likelihood outside standing minding business low.  truly get it. mild inconvenience. That's it. people adamantly refuse mildly inconvenienced reason? makes sense whatsoever. assumed surfaces physical surface, including human body. definition fomite shows assumption false.

So means primary mode transmission physical human human contact? clots caused az different nature caused birth control pill. possible interaction link ruled out. link made probably due confusion reporting: incidence rate apparently “similar”. there's air current means well ventilated virus dissipate air. outdoor transmission rare. Yeah, I'll still wear one stores public indoor places two reasons: 1.) People know I'm vaccinated want make uncomfortable; 2.) there's still small chance catch mild version pass someone else vaccinated, certainly want do.

I wearing mask mandated got used pretty quickly. Honestly, may continue wear public transportation flights even done. caught cold year nice.  Ho ho, calm down. There's lot issues vaccine deliveries (and even rollouts countries), compare us US. comment almost read like eulogy. Unless doctor worked hospital it’s unlikely fully vaccinated early. Omg, finally, someone said it. I've absolutely livid repeated argument. completely flawed.

The risk getting blood clot via vaccination get vaccinated. like said, likely develop blood clots COVID contract it. lol yeah. That, pure silence personal favorite someone asks hear sound inevitably leads explaining told see doctor that... Looks like 20k-40k may, millions following months Israel/NZ. 

For US, got approved clinical trials much longer would think, doesn’t say December older people dying fast enough free beds current wave younger patients die often instead stay longer.

Here's video Dekan Universitätsklinik Leipzig: he's saying *""Die 2. Welle im Dezember haben wir geschafft, weil wir eine Letalität von 40%... über 40% auf den Intensivstation haben. Die haben wir momentan nicht.""* - *We managed 2nd wave December 40% ... 40% people ICU dying. currently.* Maryland law hospital services. actually get estimate beforehand - can't exact there's way know exactly going find, much recovery need, etc - [get estimates insurance, price got laparoscopic cholecystectomy without cholangiography [aka gallblader removal] $6,424 little shopping around different hospitals.

Yeah agree right conclusion, wanted correct claim previously made 0 evidence it. same, someone explain. change bottom line becomes affected. Right Starbucks DD require masks nationwide. DD dropped mask mandate, Starbucks would follow suit affected bottom line due people going DD this.

Right entire extended family except one sisters vaccinated least one shot. She’s still undecided super aggressive masking distancing family gatherings we’ve had. told point blank yesterday fully vaccinated, don’t expect us wearing masks family gatherings. Aspirin won’t reduce risk vaccine-related clots, may actually make situation cautioned taking aspirin, stressing thought clotting problems immune taking aspirin going helpful. Taking anticoagulant probably isn’t going helpful, especially going get low platelet count, increase risk bleeding,” said. “And know take aspirin don’t need take aspirin benefits aren’t good risk bleed spontaneously.”

[Source (Not exactly science journal article, it’s found quick search now. I’ve seen multiple doctors say thing.) seriously still think Governments taking scientifically sound response past year half governments taking worst possible course action almost every point? sad. lasts year two, would make difference? Think suffering. Would take suffering upon yourself? compassion ill. clear one best, think worst one ahead merit... There's big difference 2 months now. many urban areas vaccine even available general public yet, recently became available.

If nothing else situation lot different 2 months. bravo Office National Statistics investigates - see 

The answer estimated c. 55%, based data two weeks ago (it takes time statistics), probably around 2/3 right approaching herd immunity levels. Wow, sooo sarcastic.  think ridiculous take. Exactly 6 7 million people, thats pretty fucking low risk dont see issue mean different vaccines produce slightly different proteins end slightly different antibodies? case identical proteins different methods generating means stronger, targeted, greater amount antibodies? Probably higher chance getting car crash way vaccination centre, car crash able seek medical attention prior symptoms car crash reaching critical point getting treated., 5 years original virus burned million half Americans dead, yet exist variant working way around killing 3-5 million Americans weakened long covid plus another 2 million otherwise healthy Americans.

The cost waiting 5 years unacceptable. people get ""ever heard immune system?"", ""99.98% survival"", ""it's flu"", ""it's hoax"". Crank magnetism specific pandemic beliefs. risk math really bad here, 1 8 wholly uninvolved. *WAYYYYYYYYYYY* less likely either catch COVID develop brain clot AZ vaccine. good thing point, way right giving credit.

That said, CDC/FDA life math people. job make public aware risk, AZ/J&amp;J paused they're ""too risky"" they're paused know risk is. FAR data shows low risk, may data available.  entire lifetimes, government's responses massive quagmires goals end sight.  worth noting shit going disappear. heard anyone say think COVID cases go zero - everyone thinks virus become endemic - many think resurgences 6-12 months virus mutates need annual boosters vaccine.

And even assume get COVID zero, mean masks useless. 10-60K Americans die per year flu alone average year (it's basically 0 year) - lot deaths could prevented wore masks forever. Uk never paused az, acknowledged potential issue advised different vaccine used 30s balance risk basis. seem much drop perception safety even though might expect one, pausing likely negative impact simply warning would what. significantly important less them. would point worth discussing risk blood clots vaccine 1 1000, even 1 10,000, time 1 1,000,000 really fearmongering. odds could get vaccine every single day rest life still ~1% chance getting blood clot. Every time climb car accepting higher risk that. talk possible delay get allergic reaction worse. ""I got vaccine"" ""which one"" ""don't know""...

Absolutely unacceptable get informed goes body. choice shot? Fine. informed consent?!!! Fuck CDC. part getting vaccinated, else want us do? virus doesn’t turn us zombies goodness sake. convenient?  country covid almost covid? people take even small risks? World leaders probably significantly lower risk grocery store workers. Pardon? anyone know long estimating approval?  We’re going reverse polarity synchronize beta waves still maintaining epsilon barrier integrity, captain. It’s never done before! People watch parents die cancers continue eat smoke death immediately after. way people are. cant people understand subset people significantly higher risk?

Because discourse surrounding people *outside subset* saying going use vaccine. explain literally one going continue shaming you, shamed people think west effectively pawn vaccines deem dangerous third world hoarding even vaccines deem safe. global effort First World deciding say ""fuck everyone else I'm going demand Pfizer vaccines"" means less vaccines everyone else. argument's sake, nobody suffered long term effects longer 18 months. would stress it. Allergies concern, chance got covid allergies masked it, pretty unlikely. 

If get non-allergy symptoms hold off. Yes.

Joking aside evangelicals this. lot others eagerly getting vaccinated return traditional services.

The pastor cited article needs stay lane, ignorance astounding he's loving neighbor discouraging high risk congregants getting vaccinated. need take video put repeat there. I’m totally serious.  Know audience.  Show video ask it. 

The article mentions mention gotten black communities board public outreach see reason can’t rural white ones.  bet endorsement Trump would persuade lot minds communities. lol over. Even blood clots issue anti-vaxx crowd got win. try giving ""facts"" ""debate"" shit wont matter. Even blood clots solid 20% 30% werent going get vaccine way higher. That’s quite right, yes likely get accident 10 miles house yes that’s thats driving, doesn’t warp driving risk per mile. Risk per mile doesn’t account care miles driven (outside one state one country) impossible keep kid away flu school. never even thought kid dying flu you? scarring people avoid future vaccines together. public needs trust vaccines safe people won’t take chance. PROVEN vaccines turn unicorn? Answer question answer question asked (hint: information available you). Well blood clots could related fact already COVID vaccinated. means vaccination cause blood clots cases.  Yeah, fanfarre preprint address AZ all, honestly rather underwhelming even narrow scope since attempt control demographics relatively small sample (compared datasets health authorities using).  mean reaction Pfizer vaccine?

So first dose Pfizer March 18th 2nd dose April 12th. never COVID far know. 

Neither vaccine produced bodily reaction. doses gave sore arm, pain annoying.

Nothing sad story doctors passing implies fully vaccinated don’t know would think that. one knows  It’s kind common saying here. motorcycle helmet laws seatbelt laws adults, loose fireworks laws, liquor stores highway, sort thing. don’t tend implement lot public safety mandates here. Keep mind 70% generally accepted minimum make vaccination worth effort. However, factors demography socioeconomic come play, 70% simply enough large city, whereas rural areas could probably get away 50%. evidenced year un-nescessary lockdowns mask mandates, coronavirus passports, barring stores selling specific goods. 

Humans hysterical panicky monkeys terrible risk assessment. what? nearly aren’t feeling symptoms probably aren’t going die lmfao. 

I swear, news sources gotta new headlines actually bring confidence vaccines. Pretty sure get choice. 30 offered AZ vaccine. 

If 30 assigned AZ refuse, get vaccine refuser get invited back. Depends many variants come know AZ vaccine sold cost (as mandated Oxford) contracts already mandate pay doses governments back right? Earth would Astrozeneca paying journalists continue even making profit result countries backing means get retool factories built part contracts production lines actually make profit.

Tomorrow open calls see anything, call. comments pop everywhere claiming significant numbers people want stay locked masked forever

Every day see plenty people vaccinated everyone know vaccinated still want everything we've now. local subreddit last night reading people's comments they're vaccinated going 2 masks 1 mask. THAT'S FUCKING CRAZY. one comment another saying thing.

There plenty people seem hurry resume normal lives, noticing them. literal island everyone gets tested. circumstances wouldn’t hesitate. also don’t wear masks training. cases exactly 6 6 million. course. Thank reasonable response. pretty bad anti vaccine arguments going around people looking ways support position. conspiracy theorizing. Multiple independent public health institutions around world come conclusion- vaccine safer natural covid infection among people 30. 

AZ isn’t charge public health institutions’ policy decisions vaccine rollout plans. institutions gathering independent statistics vaccinated people various reporting systems risk assessments. course AZ incentive make vaccine seem safe, don’t stranglehold public policy across dozens countries around world, zero evidence downplayed risk vaccine. 

The phase III trials done conjunction independent public health institutions, it’s extremely unlikely AZ would able falsify data without FDA/CDC knowing. risk complication also order 1/100,000-1/1,000,000 phase III trial less 40k participants it’s unlikely effect rare would show trials, event reporting millions doses would pick up. AZ didn’t report side effect doesn’t mean they’re maliciously downplaying risks profit. It’s rare enough couldn’t statistically detected all. 

Public health institutions around world gathered data, assessed risk, suspended use vulnerable age groups caution. system working exactly should. monetary conflict interest isn’t evidence conspiracy, absent real evidence AZ dishonest, sowing doubt way contributes vaccine hesitancy fuels anti-vaccine sentiment. exactly, perfect time drop masks, trust pritzker drop actual correct time. know it, november guys clownshow telling us wear masks ""only flu season, stop spread people.""

The main reason pause take step back see find correlation patients also get updated information healthcare providers look treat blood clots. type blood clots require unusual treatment. I'll admit, I'm super psyched get another COVID shot. Dose 2 Pfizer kicked butt. It’s nothing like US, it’s we’re getting vaccines promised ...okay, that's amazing deal. Maldives really cool. me, seem like mRNA vaccines soon vaccines game? results anybody hoping for. mean full vaccinations proceed much slowly previously thought. everyone lucky generic testing done know something like that, lots people could unknowingly risking deadly clot. it’s big deal post stuff, I'm usually ready back say good quality links. may ""win"" arguments online, links people follow. UFC continued throughout pandemic. saying. thought hoax? Experts Bible? government media experts? One possibility would colors number cases (3 colors) texture rural/urban (solid/dotted example) Better get audio recorded heater play home. Yeah think CDC start talking normal life vaccinated. vaccine allows live normal life. basically take caution around people unvaccinated might especially vulnerable severe outcomes isn’t blood clots 1/100,000 something like that? vaccines 100% effective never message. sure worry confusion around fact.

About 77MM people US fully vaccinated. 5,800 people 0.0075% number. 

Per Breakthrough cases expected. vaccines 100% effective preventing infections 10s millions people vaccinated, cases reported. feel like want get us vaccinated though, change massaging, saying vaccine prevents death going work much longer risk vaccinated, offer return normal life linked getting vaccinated, ie; masks certain percentage, restrictions businesses, online schooling, etc.

I’m worried always reason continue Public Health measures, we’ve set precedent past year. 

Objectively, would minimize death stemming respiratory illness wore masks social distanced whenever public setting. That’s truth. life much saving lives surviving. It’s seeing smiles, giving hugs, others. Unfortunately, aren’t considered Public Health experts, job unconditionally save many lives possible. Yes...it's selfish. onus everyone PHYSICALLY able get vaccine get everyone protected sake people can't. people seem think beyond noses. grown evangelicals, surprising. people yearn death, want. books aunt would read *Left Behind* novels Bible. Apocalypse/Rapture always right around corner would welcomed home Jesus. thing pastor talked sin believing evolution(this early '00s).

Now apocalypse that's coming one created humans live plastic, garbage, diseases we've spread across planet. watching evolution take place real time new variants evolve adapt readily spread infect us.

Covid greatest indictment evangelicals belief system capability self-reflection. Time toss gloves! it! first shot, nurse amazing neither boyfriend felt shots needle. 2nd shot, firefighter quite gentle hurt instantly (still applaud signing spend days putting shots arms!) Thing is, odds getting covid *at all* without vaccination going slim. You’d basically gambling population reaches herd immunity - isn’t guarantee even vaccine. world available vaccines risk blood clot, would still (in cases) best gamble vaccine not. don’t live world. vaccines known association blood clots. better option, weigh cost blood clots vs benefits vaccinations.

Hopefully, love go theme park summer without wearing thing. virus likely become endemic mutate. Especially many people hesitant getting vaccine. Plus countries can't afford vaccinate populations right away. likely us vaccinate need boosters years come variants emerge groups. 

That's important everyone get vaccinated quickly. people choose vaccinate country, new variants emerge virus percolates. That's also important help countries get vaccinated. Oh saw that. I'm flustered shit that's happening jumped ranted out. I'm far concerned lingering health issues. neighbor got December (he's there, around 70) he's still oxygen. would get flu every year handled fine. thing fucking gnarly terrible, severely underplayed impact whether die, don't. reality, fates worse death, like permanent lung scarring organ damage. relegated elderly; there's millions people who's lives permanently altered disease, across age spectrum. states outdoor mask mandate, almost one follows very, police officers willing enforce it. checked county's health department website appointment slots, perhaps pharmacy area? That's good point even think about!

I skeptical article first place, without vital information, really can't take info face value. Even setting sites, UK still got majority doses imports EU India. Best level-headed response. Thank you. land close talkers?! mean, numbers still low still enough scare people. that's we're still pretty early overall vaccination rollout. cases popping rate relative unvaccinated individuals proves vaccine's efficacy clear day. approach herd immunity red flagging certainly end people come better understand nature vaccines. experienced situation quite like century. even so, literally people say ""don't get vaccine, makes 8 times likely get south african variant"" clearly never read scientific studies entire lives. infuriating. sources English yet, decision announced major Israeli news agencies reporting it.

Google Minister Yuli (Yoel) Edelstein evening (Thursday) instructed director office, Prof. Hezi Levy, sign order allow removal masks open, starting coming Sunday, April 18. directive came receiving position professionals ministry according view low morbidity longer need masks open space. emphasized: closed area, obligation wear mask still apply. stated, directive take effect starting coming Sunday, 18.4.21.  Minister Edelstein: ""The masks intended protect us corona virus. professionals came conclusion longer needed open, decided allow masks removed according recommendation. ""For you, citizens Israel. still ask equipped mask purpose entering closed buildings. Together keep morbidity low."" That's exactly works state. know. I'm trying say selfish people refusing get vaccine potentially screw small percentage people can't get it. actions affect others, people also live actions selfish people.  8 times enough me. much higher tbh Israel, country 9,000,000 people, seven day average seven daily deaths. Cases plummeted. metrics continuing trend. vaccines work. think United States position within month, proportionally speaking would two three hundred deaths day United States. Right 764. think we're close effective social end pandemic.  I’m aware penicillin allergies lethal like blood clot is. get must stock J&amp;J something, better alternatives exist (they do), would keep using it? everyone access transportation alternatives ride transportation serup j&amp;j tomorrow. get covid who's fault that? transportation. 38 life long smoker. Former opiate addict taking mu opiate stave cravings 10 years now. transportation. job laid year. Need appointment close find ride. CDC PR bullshit campaign. know risks benefits wiegh 6.799.994 million Illinois case rise slowing material change mobility. Feels like green shoots. realize covid cause blood clots? much higher rate? science always clear masks would offer protection respiratory virus. lied anyways.  Congrats making last statement. i'm double age curiosity, many hs peers planning get shot? Less half? know HPV vaccine something like 25% teens take it. Unfortunately, people live choice too. That’s works. got vaccine without providing that. name phone number.  trumpet players, also try prevent wearing earplugs. /s 

but yeah, like post said inner ear damage deafness cause tinnitus. pretty common problem one can't actually cured, though tinnitus debilitating even really problem. tinnitus gets loud enough start interfering sleep become pretty serious issue. Well, choice, then. there's nothing even kind imply vaccine role play death, even know doctor vaccinated. sounds like previous poster describing, completely baseless assumption hopping get conclusion likely validates deeper fear holds. mean lots cases early pandemic last year, like Valencia / Atalanta Champions League game one main causes behind serious COVID outbreak Bergamo (one hardest hit cities Italy). Later manager Atalanta said decided coach game rather going hospital, despite COVID symptoms, scared number COVID patients already Bergamo hospital (he later tested positive COVID). Valencia's side said third team's coaching staff + players also tested positive.

As recently, pretty big outbreaks caused matches get postponed EPL (the league follow, I'm sure others well) - example Newcastle reportedly 19 positive cases week December, forced postpone least one match (and IIRC one best players, Allan Saint-Maximin, struggled symptoms weeks). Man City players men's women's teams also postpone match.

And expand sports - follow figure skating lot top contenders (particularly women's figure skating) Russia, lot cases Russian figure skating community particular, including skater named Alena Kostornaia, reigning European Champion (which considering Russia's dominance means automatically one favorites win Worlds / Olympics) - many weeks serious case COVID, ran time get back competitive shape qualify Worlds, despite 16 years old put risk group COVID all. Luckily winter olympics next year, would say example trying hold Olympics middle pandemic negative impact competitive integrity games well, especially sports like figure skating lot top contenders might 1 shot entire career qualify compete. Unfortunately people want get vaccine can't medical reasons. Fox gave Tucker Carlson prime time space day spread theory vaccine actually work. Actually necessarily. believe testing several different boosters. Original booster, one targets problematic strain(s), one mix. think going know protection piercing events know happening. quite possible simply elevating levels existing antibodies sufficient. Even though strains tougher fight. TLDR we'll wait see solidify boosters look like, need them, need (waning antibodies, protection piercing strains, etc.) free sense cost individual people money. I, along 7 million, don’t decide get vaccinated, money saved. girlfriend got COVID time (last November) got vaccine within week (me last week, week). slightly worse COVID symptoms did, absolutely bowled vaccine side effects I've sore arm times. There’s also math knowing risk exists, treatable? limited understanding, clots treatable *not* heparin, go-to anticoagulant. risk understood managed saying “if experience symptoms within next n-m days, go get checked this.”

There lot ways mitigate risk, think pause make sure risk clearly understood decisions made. politicians Lithuania also waited turn age (just oldest parliamentarians elderly former officials vaccinated) start. However, drama AZ vaccination suspension continuation happened, president MPs vaccinated AZ promote confidence. added '/s' end refers sarcastic.

Yes, best time sarcastic joke it. Neither outdoor mask mandate moment.

Vaccines working Israel ahead curve; outdoor transmission never problem except crowded situations. there's medical data kind scenario. AZ Pfizer use 2 different types delivery mechanisms. Immunologists know interact, whether counteract other. I've read incidental reports patients one reason another missed 2nd dose scheduled time, doctors advising hold take vaccine possible, even many weeks later. recommend mixing matching. wasn’t able access article, establish causation vaccine clots? headline makes seem vaccine virus cause clots, virus 8 times likely cause.

In event vaccine cause clots, know vaccines show behavior? not, maybe let’s call better ones shift supply better vaccines (assuming similar efficacy preventing infection).

I wouldn’t blame anyone wanting wait better vaccine, staying cautious every day lives. situation typical, even US. people live cities suburbs case. Israel general higher population density US, Jerusalem similar population density San Francisco. happened briefly FL made residency requirement since stopped, see happening couple months. Honestly, not? Come drop money getchu shot.   Well still horrible title. 1 10 people got az would gotten covid otherwise. Az would still cause blood clots covid would have. mean 10000x people would hospitalized 39 things covid causes. whole thing besides point hysteria. title misleading.                                                  submission linking dailymail.co.uk automatically removed source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

 can't believe people sub find hard believe Covid dangerous vaccine, virus clearly killed millions people? fine. major issue see people already vaccinations efforts slow spread COVID using justify getting vaccine all. “See told vaccines bad.

Does create situation got Pfizer initially, you’d need stay Pfizer booster? would okay get Moderna point? good reason r/covid19_support Yeah. Agreed 100%

Consult personal risk level. 

It's difficult convince young people get vaccine risk virus likely zero effect them.

There good case made certain subset population get based personal risk. support it. also cannot blame younger people avoid particular, new, political, vaccine. need indoor one go? Seriously what's left wait for? Right, vaccines people getting free, totally scam. could mean know theres way 6, 6 officially confirmed Time tell us ditch masks. say later Memorial Day. care them. think help. think loved ones worth less prioritize people instead them.

Anyway, yes, plenty bad things COVID brain every organ well. want catch it. seems like scam anymore . Well flu vaccine year different different strains got second shot yesterday completely kicked ass. Day 2 woke sweats, sore joints, flu like symptoms, etc.

What chances booster making feel way again? mean, ill get regardless, curious. variant fears overblown?

Given vaccines target spike protein, virus mutates enough spike protein longer recognizable antibodies, likely spike protein longer able bind cells?

/s  FYI, asymptomatic transmission disproven major source COVID-19 transmission. (Note - include pre-symptomatic individuals). I'm saying kids can't get spread COVID-19 completely asymptomatic transmission unlikely. love stuff.  
Much better seeing maskless parents kids, freaking grocery stores going racist / conspiratorial tirades public.

Brave. think boosters get made said sure. However, Pfizer Moderna vaccines operate kind way, I've heard could get one first shot 2nd, would effective.

I heard vaccines kind interchangeability though, work different principles. keeled tomorrow affect running government all? major American Pharmaceutical company buys get money right pockets. think way people infected measured/detected testing. completely conjecture, though. They're heavy expensive ship. Raw material prices also up. used market decimated.

FWIW I'd advocate barbell rack accommodate it. Possibly. vaccines chance side effects. gets vaccinated age, position would tier 3 yet line. cases drop low enough amount. sure exactly number. Israel example dropped mask mandate way ahead this. Almost like there's correlation idiot caring health and... idiot caring health. need outreach communities like increase vaccinations combat misinformation. agree you, getting vaccinated small real contribution eventual restriction-lifting vaccination statistics get better better, it’ll harder harder justify restrictions

Plus almost downside. It’s safe, painful, takes 30 minutes.

I totally counterproductiveness making vaccinated people follow restrictions, don’t think avoiding vaccination spite actually help practical way Wait foumd another case. Perfect 1 million now.

COVID complications aside people still get clots people got shot. said, COVID lot worse shit still worth getting vaccine unless better options available. basically im saying worth cautious about, used emergency (which in), better options available (and right often arent). ‘Some may die...’ FUCK needs ""breaking news"" might happen 12 months. news media needs fucking regulation yesterday. got Moderna today actually. always figured booster shot kind would necessary. question is, I’ve original Moderna vaccine, stick Moderna’s booster get Pfizer J&amp;J booster?

Notes:

* Data [CDC vaccination demographic trends exact totals every age group downloaded CSV. site provides graph data time. graph title says ""Date Administered"", data closely represents doses ""Date Reported"".
* Changes calculated unrounded numbers may differ rounded percentages.
* Texas (about 9% US population) excluded CDC source due lack age-related vaccination data, data match national totals.
* CDC reports vaccinations 0-17 age group. 16-17 age group calculated using 2019 Census estimates 11.4% aged 0 17 ages 16 17, assumes 0-17 age group doses given ages 16 17 since vaccines currently approved use age 16.
* 16+ 0+ age groups include doses administered unknown ages. usually less 0.02% total doses administered.

&amp;#x200B;

* Changes since yesterday: Switch ""%"" ""pp"" table add explanation. rare, either. 10% cases (which still means lot cases!), lot also many outdoor activities like outdoor dining, concerts, team sports widely banned, there's still fair amount social distancing mask use even outside people close together.

It also seems like much harder contact trace outside exposure, may still undercounting that. AZ basically preferred serve first.

Which is, according contract, illegal.

I caught virulent flu strain college dorm 18 probably curled fetal bed dark 2-3 days could stay extended periods. Thanks! know everyone says zero Covid unrealistic vaccines make non issue due plummeting deaths really want life like before. don’t want hear Covid, think Covid, fear Covid. miss normal life wondering infections.

Looking forward June hoping things turn around sooner! ... mRNA vaccines work well new variants (it seems like case, now). Yes, exactly. plenty friends different views mine views start get less based reality/facts get close based crazy might good time re-evaluate. course that’s CDC recommends, that’s really people would lying vaccinated. Personally I’ve vaccinated I’m starting check out. It’s hard abide rules don’t actually protect people around anymore. CDC said quarantine close contact, means someone could cough face covid could go daily basis. scenario, even mask, far risk going unmasked. mention basically every study matter said asymptomatic transmission vaccinated pretty much happen.  someone NH, fan governor, he’s done good job leading state listening medical experts. Thats don’t data beyond that, want make unsupported claims despite likely would correct. shots haven’t year. History general. disagree. US donate lots doses money. ""empty promises"".

Notes:

* Data [CDC vaccination demographic trends exact totals every age group downloaded CSV. site provides graph data time. graph title says ""Date Administered"", data closely represents doses ""Date Reported"".
* Changes calculated unrounded numbers may differ rounded percentages.
* Texas (about 9% US population) excluded CDC source due lack age-related vaccination data, data match national totals.
* CDC reports vaccinations 0-17 age group. 16-17 age group calculated using 2019 Census estimates 11.4% aged 0 17 ages 16 17, assumes 0-17 age group doses given ages 16 17 since vaccines currently approved use age 16.
* 16+ 0+ age groups include doses administered unknown ages. usually less 0.02% total doses administered.

&amp;#x200B;

* Changes since yesterday: Switch ""%"" ""pp"" table add explanation. Faaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaark off!! April/may. collected six months data apply full authorization. seeing people's facial expressions, non-verbal cues, etc. part natural human behavior, wearing mask prevents lot that. physical sensation mask touching face.

I'm anti-mask, continue wear mine long required, fucking weird understand point. think point die COVID. mad? get flu shot every year?  also fair, risks additive. vaccine increases risk death, increased total risk death, though course less double. Nbc, cnn, idk, probably them? Nbc main one watch. They're even sending notifications phone J&amp;J side effects clotting issues. days now. problem they're producing.

Cutting customer's order nearly 80% get bad PR, yes. Endemic? understand concerns, risk wise taking vaccine versus risking covid brainer. serious question? ask what's even point changing oil car sick every thousand miles? amount cases matter. studies designed stop they've tracked certain number cases control group. 

So higher lower community infection rates change long trial takes complete, nothing else it. 

Now, J&amp;J dealt variants, might effect. that's different thing. earth still indoor mask mandate? I'm Region Hannover. 
I going gripe, pleasantly surprised:  
  
I afternoon snagged appointment doctor's next week. wife, she'll hospital vax-day, gave instead. 
  
I calculated probabilities serious illness, we're even.  
   
  
Perhaps hospitals also offer shots? alternative science, idiocy... say North Korea bad.. suppose meant, “in context risks already endure daily basis”; things naturally allow/ignore rate occurrence falls low it’s almost equally likely happen chance negligence. being, don’t generally care significance risk going bathroom, it’s ordinary thing inherent safety it, yet least people die defecation syncope year. Extraordinarily rare, interesting people study precisely one thing, makes less fraction percentage cases less percentage population less percentage bathroom visits given calendar year.

Sorry, maybe I’m using wrong terminology; point merely “getting blood clot due vaccine” far list things give blood clots may well even make appearance. Clots occur 1 1000 people per year, vaccinated not, attributing one particular clot vaccine tenuous, best (in estimation).It’s like saying TECHNICALLY, time, non-zero risk crab could gain intelligence, learn wield knife take hostage, likelihood isn’t even worth bearing consideration grand scheme things. I’m honestly even sure clots directly correlated vaccine, yet, given low rate incidence myriad factors could causing it; wonder we’re looking it’s possibility. Like made new cancer treatment drug found patients new tumors; took drug, already cancer?

I’m probably element this, though. Fact is, don’t think there’s cause alarm. Numbers definitions aside, it’s still likely choke lunch die someone gets blood clot vaccine. could one last booster. might even really needed mRNA vaccines seem give decent protection current variants well, spike protein 'code' prefusion form. 5 million people Norway, 5% fully vaccinated 0 1 daily deaths. It’d comical weren’t depressingly sad many others still convinced despite evidence masks work. eh? regret never getting sequel movie. roughly figure immunity starts kick two weeks first dose, here's percent age group US robust protection result vaccination:

**65-74** | 73.9%
**50-64** | 41.8%
**40-49** | 29.9%
**30-39** | 24.7%
**18-29** | 16.4%
**&lt;18** | 0.5%  Sure, disproportionate prior hospitalization ratios? Absolute case count exploding India. news media watching terrifying vaccines curiosity Yeah studies important feelings anecdotes. think hard say anything concrete we'll see data week. canceled J&amp;J appointments can't rescheduled instantaneously, may piece what's going on, especially given every single J&amp;J shot would first dose. also may seeing people take beat vaccine types result pause, mean get another week two. This. 

Last year CDC lied wearing masks afraid people would react. 

How would people react came said something along lines thousands people developing blood clots gave green flag. literally millions people walking around vaccine people VOLUNTARILY took, offered highly encouraged governments. 

What hell kind pandemonium would see general public? really believe 6 however million? Really?

Let’s forget month ago 0 blood clot cases J&amp;J. numbers see 3 months now?

It’s going trickle time. hey go ahead call antivaxxer conspiracy theorist. Good luck. study performed Oxford? hand developing AstraZeneca vaccine? imply bias?
I personally heavily favor vaccination believe occurrence rate low enough AZ Vax appears safe. said feel study borderline unethical due conflicts interest. pandemic vaccine passports used anymore.

lol 56.2% *total* population vaccinated, 68.7% 18+. How's milestone? Pretty cool. countries enjoying low case numbers spite vaccinations?  date makes sense. pinned either case rates vaccination rates. ""Mask mandates end \~70% population fully vaccinated"" makes sense. gives vaccine hesitant extra incentive get vaccine. ""Mask mandates end daily case rates drop 5 per 100,000"" makes perhaps even sense - can't spread catch disease hardly anyone it. AstraZeneca half Swedish 20 minutes

Is standard? Every time I've gotten vaccine quick read several articles said cases Michigan overwhelmingly 65+ group seems mean vaccines working.

The problem variants harder young people OG Rona. Yes 50,000 observationally study important lives athletes ruined disease. Good hill die on. must subscribe subs 🤷‍♂️ economic benefit vaccinating domestically far greater exporting. enables India recover faster. 

Politically also makes much sense. 

I can't believe people reasonably expect India give doses countries higher vaccination rates themselves. CDC study saying one dose two weeks 80% effective infection. based 4,000 health-care personnel, first responders front-line workers awesome Light end tunnel gettng bigger love see Science awesome There's also fact J&amp;J similar normal flu vaccine Moderna Pfizer use mRNA Trial data, Israel data, etc.  link trial.  Also roughly 190M doses administered USA without reports significant side effects per Fauci UK woman I’d take whatever I’m given, whole thing blown proportion. people gave much shit medicine killing us 🙄 taste opposed smell... don’t recall loss smell much, make point wife cliche “take big bite raw onion” chewed infront her, really couldn’t taste anything. 


7 months it’s returned normal... think. still selling vaccine cost pandemic over. two countries contractually stipulated ""first dibs"" number doses must first delivered

All true, add, EU put similar clause new big order Pfizer, people inevitably coming topic making EU morally superior selfless things kidding themselves. reason EU enough vaccines screwed initial contracts, charitable good. US donating Doses publicity stunt, one egoistical countries comes vaccines consider 2% global population removed something worry about. point would start care? 5%? 10%? 25%? Would bothered Thanos snap? Hmm, sure kids getting flu shots anything getting COVID shots? ... Covid (1) flu. (2) also get flu shot. Flu pretty bad. ""grippaler Infect"" - real flu really bad.

So, get flu shot - COVID shot. empty promises US coming late.

Here abc article senior administration official said Thursday ""this pledge COVAX impact vaccination program United States we're able share vaccine doses time we're focused American vaccinations getting shots arms,"" official said, ""we're working hard support COVAX, strengthen global vaccination around world determining timeline sufficient supply United States able donate surplus Russia, meanwhile, donated doses homegrown COVID-19 vaccines partners developing countries form ""vaccine diplomacy."" United States yet followed suit. blood clot cause immediate death. symptoms, treated? would good bring awareness people still get vaccinated.  
  
Humans aren’t immortal together take steps live longer. Facts evidence-based discussions Reddit

You must using different “Reddit”. though, least way humans execute mask usage :P  (had re-edit post, forgot put ""Massachusetts"" normally do)

The target I'm looking 62% general population dose 1 58% fully vaccinated. point would surpass Israel slowed significantly vaccine distribution cases nosedived. Right target ~60% overall fully vaccinated doses looks like early mid June (barring Janssen vaccine paused now). original data signal association AZ vaccine clots peer reviewed? /r/coronavirus population number interesting.

In home state (Washington), 7.5M people 7 daily deaths well. (presumably) healthy, unvaccinated four-year-old, son lower odds severe COVID fully vaccinated adults. risk scenario really parents getting child getting severe disease themselves.

Of course, taking precautions anyway, adding risk son continuous risk-taking going make difference.

On hand, consider effect would son got it, allowed see him, transmitted parents, died. Even consented risk riskier things every day.

The choice yours. Yep. Better variant boosters ready need need them. ever worth it? suggesting experts lying current situation? said risk passengers exposed virus infected person plane could reduced 23% 57% middle seats empty, compared full flight.

Okay, many outbreaks linked flights? reduction risk mean much real world infection rate planes [already decrease 100,000 50,000 decrease 10 5 called ""50 percent decrease,"" people recognize two different measurements. wonder used preventative measure, like face masks. crowded indoor situations, people would use nasal spray sort virus condom. Maybe also come mouthwash similar abilities. antibody test possible, work giving booster. fascinating fact now. pointless first place, mandate country many people vaccinated beyond absurd. cult cloth however strong even there. ""Earlier Thursday, Biden administration’s Covid response chief science officer David Kessler said Americans expect receive booster shots protect coronavirus variants. "" treated like math problem problem redditors really bad math point seems purposefully wrong, probably general/surface-level statistics usually point outcome desire getting specific/smarter leads contradictory outcome.

Instead 6 7 million, cut population subsets. One woman 20s got dangerous blood clot X (which less 7 million, let's say 100 extreme) women 20s got vaccine. case gone probability that's extremely small 1% chance. compare probability blood clot covid woman 20s. lower 1%, safer get covid get vaccine women 20s comes blood clots.

The 6 7 million incorrect, misleading. example ""lies, damned lies, statistics"". churches schools particular issue. 

I went high school Alabama people would put answers needed pass tests get college, knew real truth things like natural selection, learned church. Honest question: hostility? need many people comfortable taking COVID vaccine possible. Isn’t demonstrating dangers dealt swiftly thoroughly good thing? Public health officials understand that, willing listen public health officials spent past year informing benefits things like masks lockdowns, pause distributing vaccine decide know them? track both, first shot metric one matters most?

Second shots measure first shots month ago, first shots provides vast majority protection.

**80% 65+!!!!** think read July 7, 2021 prediction, would longer expected Meanwhile Ontario pandemic worse ever been. jealous! Serious question: we’re tracking second shots success metric behind scenes, would newspaper headline first shots? Note stockpile delivered vaccines growing throughout week, standing 57,083,625 vaccine doses, 56,2 million doses yesterday. Stock looking healthy current delivery pace, continues outpace administration approximately million doses. They're reproducing like crazy.  Check Quiverfull movement. 8? compare odds actually catching covid? ""These mRNA vaccines proven nothing safe EXTREMLY effective.""

I'm challenging here, genuinely curious see sources studies discovered prove this. Would able share? bad, totally misread thought said would get 547 July 7th like, ""wow that's long time deaths still high.""   Previous reports suggested agreement Indian government wanted Pfizer trials India first, Pfizer reluctant do. that's I'm getting at. valid considering large amount data go by? also pretty easy avoid unlimited resources huge dumbass. No. 

We need reconcile human population levels sustainable carrying capacity. 

We need reinstate human rights abuses past.  needed.

In NFL heard one 1,696 active players hospitalized. I’m sure know don’t

Peer reviewing scientists test hypothesis try poke holes research. Depending research peer reviewing take months years complete depending study. paper peer reviewed research make curious taken fact bigger thing people missing mutation. time till whole world vaccinated increase dramatically stop using AZ/J&amp;J vaccines. means lot people dying far longer chance virus mutate something current vaccines effective putting us back square one. 

If harder lock downs virus spread lot less people first year variants came might never exist least may never taken hold spread. 

A crucial factor time start finish vaccinations try get point COVID infecting people chances significant mutation decrease potentially gets stopped dead tracks.

The last thing need variant vaccines effective against. give link?  want say sorry done mentally covid real. uncle one them. Constantly said November sore throat. Contracted actual covid got super sick. least admits wrong now. sure (any North American-based news channels/sources) considered source information holier-than-thous ok... 🥱🤫 Because, least country, went exactly lot advise actual experts last weeks. Furthermore European medical association also said continue use vaccine benefits far outweigh risks. part, part may still possible catch mild version covid spread others vaccinated I've got idea they're going drop off, unless misspoke believe made estimate we'll get 547, July 7 seven day average. make rough estimate, think we'll see get well number early May, I've got idea- stuff practically chaos theory action. majority people know refusing vaccine least healthy people know. RIP. interesting, would great inference true.

I guess know causes better advise.

Risk drug, even standard pain killers.

Wonder J&amp;J issue use similar technology. I've fully vaccinated really follow I'm interested thing progress, sentiment, course, things reopen. think everyone's best interest help countries. Vaccine hesitancy summer, point we'll plenty share. So... recommending reinstate prima nocta? Yup, mom nurse hospital get first dose December 30. small practice there's way prioritized early. It’s gosh darn trolley problem isn’t it? Uh oh Thats terrible argument lmao dunno. I’m Idaho right worried lot people don’t want vaccine. mother law gives shots said hundreds doses left day capacity 500 doses day. still think get 50% adults complying, hopeful enough natural infection immunity, think going continue pockets country shit always prevalent weird think rest us going enjoy summer. Gonna pass 200 million mark tomorrow's update! PA Vaccination update:

Mask usage lower it’s longer required that’s peoples’ nature beginning pandemic still ends 


People wearing masks vaccinated people— saw social experiments last month states away national mask mandates &amp; opening stadiums &amp; consequently surge young adults hospitalized b17 :c 

It would great vaccines masks went hand-in-hand, vaccinations reaching levels herd immunity since anti-maskers overlap lot anti-vaxxers; plus don’t know long vaccine last without booster/the potential variants could still come cuz virus’ living things evolve

The problem, mentioned, ""it's safe *yet*"" approach. lacks details basically licking finger sticking wind. since know virus going become endemic, always way contrive way still ""not safe"" yet.

My personal point watch start seeing U.S. nationwide daily average new caseload 20,000, deaths 200, vaccinations 60%. That's point beyond we're potentially edging post-pandemic mask mandates becomes justifiable IMO start ignoring certain settings.

Basically start seeing headlines XX metric lowest level since March 2020, ought beginning death knell mask mandates. Tens thousands people every year also die Covid common cold. still shut US nothing seriously doubt held accountable, legality documents online, actually think people won’t loophole liability? It’s way world honest would impossible generalize. would depend concentration virus begin often air replaced. Typically air current enclosed space means air drawn outside source, amount virus would fall new air replaces it. room little air flow would concerning. Brazilian, think headline bit shocking informative.

The situations p1 variant spreads easier national effort face Covid here. lack effort resulted ICU units 90% capacity many states. Governors making mixed decisions face Covid. example, São Paulo state closed shopping centers, gyms essential services/stores. time, even hospitals full, wants reopen schools reduce restrictions.

The problem due lack restrictions virus keep spreading, replicating that's mutations born. variant resistant vaccines, new even worse situation face. Biontech guess. AZ allowed people 60 discussion coworker blaming Vaccine trials media covering up! 
Had walk away coffee table! There’s effective treatment blood clots too.. Ya risk marginal young people really matter lol. People vaccine still spread ffs. Idk I’ve got vaccines one shove ass, made much money us vaccines makes sick true, lot people inherently distrustful anything medical back mind like ""well fuck, probably gonna big bill""

i go myself, always question going doctor/dentist/etc i'm wondering much going cost

it's really awful, awful system you’re hospital environment positive patients given breathing treatments receiving mechanical ventilation, airborne particles survive minutes hours. 

Real world settings unlikely airborne spread. droplets expelled infected people cough, talk, exhale drop fairly quickly (this staying 6ft apart recommended) project farther yelling, singing, forcefully coughing/sneezing. 

Droplet viability infectiousness also dependent factors like humidity, air flow, air filtration, air quality. Surface transmission rare. come never heard blood clots COVID AstraZeneca vaccine came out? Thank you. read re-read headline article since made little sense me.  go small gym open mostly open one form another throughout pandemic. restrictions group classes, many people once, small gym rarely people time easy socially distance, like 10-20 feet apart. Sometimes workouts outside. extra cleaning crews come through, everyone wipes everything down, etc.

It absolute life saver me, getting house, exercising, little bit social interaction, sense normalcy. Honestly sure would done without it. government offers alternative Great summary person school. elementary school person year zero cases transmission. done safely young kids right protocol place. person education essential children looked way. doesn’t seem look gender dimension, though, it? many male blood clot cases? think looking women only, risk clots might close double. woman 30s work home indefinitely, I’m excited getting AZ. since I’m U.K. don’t think I’ll get choice. data odds getting COVID? included rate get COVID. I’m smart enough calculate this, hoping someone else can. Stonks!

No Joke, that's clever! Well, sounds terrible. told hydrate help eliminate side effects. I'm going tell get leg cramps even though proof. history leg cramps, fun, go second shot week today. received AZ month ago, EU countries pausing it. first worried, got vaccination appointment, NL denmark paused AZ. countries followed later day. end, consulting doctors realizing EU countries pausing UK vaccine (which btw like twice many orders next ordered vaxx), I've accepted political bullshit done EU suits. Even EU healthcare professionals tried convincing stupid pause vaccinations, guess big pharma paid big bucks decisionmakers. big money we're talking here, billions doses. 

I'm saying tinfoil hat on, cmon, painfully obvious anti-UK move dressed wellbeing concern. result? Preventable deaths, delayed opening countries, money pfizer guys. Nice going EU, suck bag dicks. Never wore outdoors all. Outdoor transmission rare. public healthcare comes taxes right? one actually pay it? many people choose private option since you’re paying public option regardless (unless don’t work) Right, compare vaccinated group placebo group, assuming equal exposure large. Mask usage already 50 percent Walmart got vaccinated SC. wish higher that. I'm fully vaccinated I'm probably going continue wear type mask (but necessarily headband style medical equivalent mask times) allow wear one around vaccinated friends family dining restaurants/bars eventually.

In country high infection rate available alternatives, working vaccine huge benefit. country low infection rate / available alternatives might look different. think problem ppl assume usual suspects. seen lot ppl plain scared. think time ppl follow lead ppl know trust. nervous getting first shot, felt comfort knowing trusted family members gotten shot. whole blame game got stop. Selfish? propose lockdown ends? you...read?

There one point one point complicated single data points mean

Unless think viruses easy approach literal everywhere anywhere? basically. life. I'm gonna risk risk please. may say selfish, me, life important is. 99% people feel way lives even admit it. People claiming otherwise performative. me. settles onto surface longer air, no? 

Airborne transmission (infection via smaller particles remain suspended air) relatively rare. Whether viable source infection depends circumstance—so enclosed spaces high concentrations virus poor ventilation. 

A sealed room infected person rigorous exercise hour could remain significant risk exposure hours person left whereas room open windows infected person sits quietly fifteen minutes would low risk almost immediately they've left. Shoot I've scheduled mine dad's numerous times. county simple can't get shit together. study showed Pfizer almost occurrence blood clots. really better. Agreed. think marginally help, but, rate new cases kept falling Texas lifted mask mandates March 10th.

The main driver new cases small household gatherings hard restrict. sufficient time scale assume everyone “get” covid . also consider ethical circumstances. There's difference knowingly subjecting healthy person compared hypothetical risk catching disease. right now, New Hampshire state half total population vaccinated least one dose. guess Sununu saw Israel’s success achieved 50% total population vaccinated banking ending like them. hope that’s case. Cries American English Meh, least understand nothing free. Could healthcare facility changed rules types masks acceptable, boss tell you?

My healthcare facility employees (does matter type role) surgical mask respirator mask (which collectively calling ""barrier masks"") required wear mask. longer allow cloth masks masking required. change implemented later 2020 facility. straight forward statement

And vague, still confirming situation question health care workers' feelings?

If health care workers' feelings, situation called dramatic even 10 people hospital, turn called slightly concerning much higher figures. point exactly interesting see different places countries interpret word ""dramatic"" context. voting!  large scale makes sense would 20 year old take risk getting covid.

I dont know numbers isnt probability death Pretty close?

As 20 year old dying clot dying covid true placebo group, randomization double blinding (so one choose know vaccine got), large trial groups would exposed rate average. reduction cases attributable vaccine. matter risk assessment. circumstances asseseemnt recommned taking AZ. all.

So 1 every 200,000 people might experience blood clots?

I mean, way better chance getting car accident way work. risk assessment tells I'll probably fine... mean seems anti-capitalism give patent owned companies developed without agreement companies. Kinda removes incentive companies develop vaccines lose profit governments giving designs away. Personally think patent given out, ramp vaccine production dole 3rd world countries first.  


Europe Astra Zenica (which used great success UK, less 0.001% issues) stopping ludicrous. vaccines sitting without obligation keep house (like US contracts Pfizer Moderna) dole needed. aren't. 


India producing vaccines amazingly fast, 1.3 billion people amount vaccines going stop surge going through. 


Africa 3rd world nations (like Brazil instance) vaccine program make own, facilities acquire design. countries like USA help first. ones biggest threats variants popping woodwork.

That happened, Canada line waited long make deal, refused pay premium principle. frothing mouth commentary shows never read Guardian downvotes, least.

But everything read critically, college important outside career training. standard citizens, population knows critically think. surprised well. think thing would've happened without pause. vaccines don’t carry long term immunity require booster, risk getting COVID choose vaccinate basically 100% time Interesting NH Covid hotspot then! even slightly elevated, numbers worse homeopathic. vaccine actively causes blood clots, we're dealing confounding factors like pregnancy or, y'know, alive getting enough movement day long, guess what, evidence actually acute effect people really, really thin.

Once alternatives readily available, problem opt Pfizer. problem unlike food sector, multiple alternatives readily available (if know salami contains listeria, even eat bread plain), Covid vaccines, alternative vaccination vaccination danger Covid infection every day. US, pretty much ""not take J&amp;J vaccine get Pfizer/Moderna within weeks"".

Yeah, Europe, that's controversy surrounding vaccine worst effects. Sorry already said, hold water, takeaway clot likely caused COVID vaccine, likely documented cases [edit clarity: people vaccine] caused COVID vaccine? all, vaccine 100% effective. throw whole basis caution vaccine doubt? nb read article yet sorry I'm saying something without value. looks like incidence increase vs typical backround 3-4 cases CVT per million people BARELY increased getting AZ vaccine. point actually may even affecting results. guess i'm saying is, vaccine not, many people CVT per 1 million. covid incidence goes 3-4 cases 39 cases per 1 million.

What tell us, however, they're cautious either way, safe, even safe look every reported instance major problems.

Let's get bigger issue. fact news sources reporting things reported kind confirmation issue, resulting massive effects society whole. someone hereditary clotting disorder fucking glad got different vaccine

people annoyed attention clotting getting realize stuff matters lots people, it’s literally life death I'm shocked Pfizer would deny finding ""watch do, say"" stupid mentality. trusting interpretation experts actually saying/doing things. flat earth mentality. want believe see ignore reality get see everything. never space dont believe earth globe since never seen interpretation see points conclusion world flat enough knowledge expertise understand properly interpret see. tendency judge people lens life experiences, conveniently ignoring experiences around us.

Why would live life fear? I've survived *way* deadlier viruses Covid-19, like 2% death rate covid scares me. wear mask social distance, people find shocking I'm overall unconcerned potentially catching virus. Same...unless course somebody brings subject tinitus. Losing sense smell means went brain, seeing brain bleeds additional rare events many months later COVID infected advanced rate vs control groups. controls pneumonia flu instead COVID (so compare people got sick, another similar virus/respiratory infection). It’s great. actually makes self serving sense insurance pay vaccines.

Yep. scheduled get J&amp;J vaccine two days ago, morning pause happened immediately switched Moderna provider (my school, case) need reschedule make new appointment.

The bigger issue pausing J&amp;J vaccine US affect public trust vaccines general, affects vaccine rollout/availability certain populations, namely homeless. guess blood clots brain little prevalent 5 million Think man lost leg, lungs transplanted, person suddenly developed diabetes due infection attacking pancreas, youth lost 70% colon due gastric version...the person can't think straight anymore went brain, many want cite?

I one word you. **Wait.** intriguing people ignore real facts vaccine may cause unnecessary side effects, however, incidence rate minimal non-existent across vaccinated sample. Besides, every medicine risk such.

Problem is, (antivaxx) lack brain capacity critically analyse bit information come across immediately jump conclusions. Behavior certainly vaccinated people though, that's impossible control real world. w00t! Thats already happening. Lots rich latin americans going Miami get vaccine.

The real number look 6 7 million. 6 however many young women got J&amp;J (plus since takes two weeks show up, might 6 amount given out). 

In state 4% vaccine supply J&amp;J makes sense young women get Pfizer/Moderna. Except real world data Pfizer 100 million Approximately two weeks first shot Pfizer/Moderna vaccines, 80% efficaceous. Meaning compared unvaccinated person living community behaving way you, 80% less likely get COVID.

Approximately 1-2 weeks second dose, vaccine give maximum protection, 95% efficacy. that's true actually got second shot. clear single shot already gives protection, seems likely protection good probably also decays faster compared fully vaccinated. thing see pro vaccine willing (or capable) analyze available information scientific journals decide myself, far, evidence points direction vaccine outweighs risk associated virus.

However, side spectrum people ignore evidence rather, choose believe fairy tales unicorns. Depends much longer COVID continues prevalent community, kind precautions individual taking it, local case rates one's specific community, etc. 

Sure, pretty obvious one's personal precautions are, point, basically good dodging bullets. Covid wil continue prevalent countries population mostly vaccinated - tell people done fuck-all-nothing prevent spreading.
